The announcement was made following a joint meeting for land acquisition called by Konkan divisional commissioner (DC) Vilas Patil to take a review of all crucial infrastructure projects passing through Thane district but are held up due to delayed land acquisition. It may be noted that Thane district has several crucial infrastructure projects cutting through it including the Mumbai-Vadodara national highway, dedicated railway freight corridor, Kalyan-Kasara additional lines and Samruddhi highway among few. The prominent HSR project requires over 140 Ha of land including private and government. Around 28Ha private land is yet to be acquired for the project, said NHRSCL officials. “These are crucial projects for the state and country and shouldn’t be delayed due to land acquisition. The administration should take adequate efforts and ensure all obstacles in their progress are cleared at the earliest,” said Patil while addressing the officials. “The HSR project requires 79 hectares of land in Thane district of which 51 has been acquired and the rest which are in Bhiwandi and Thane talukas are in various stages of acquisition. The DC has directed us to expedite the acquisition and complete the process in the next two months. The acquisition process for other projects will also be hastened,” said Prashant Suryawanshi, land acquisition, Thane district. Activists have been long complaining that schedules of few have been apparently delayed due to slow land acquisition and transfer by the administration. Last year, the Thane corporation had junked the transfer of a crucial part of land for constructing a tunnel on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail (HSR) route in Diva which was eventually cleared recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/land-acquisition-for-mumbai-ahmedabad-high-speed-rail-project-to-be-completed-within-two-months-say-officials/articleshow/87192695.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Sandra Mason, the current governor-general, is set to be sworn in as president on November 30, the country's 55th anniversary of independence from Britain.  Calling the parliamentary vote a "historic milestone on the road to the Republic," the Barbadian government tweeted that its House and Senate had elected Mason, 72, on Wednesday.  In September 2020, Mason announced the break with Britain, saying "the time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind."  "Having attained Independence over half a century ago, our country can be in no doubt about its capacity for self-governance," she said.  When asked about the plans last year, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said it was "a matter for the government and people of Barbados."  Barbados -- which has a population of just under 300,000 -- was claimed by the British in 1625. It has sometimes been called "Little England" for its loyalty to British customs.  It is relatively prosperous, and a popular tourist destination: prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, more than a million tourists visited its idyllic beaches and crystalline waters each year.  The Caribbean's easternmost island is also well-known as the birthplace of superstar singer Rihanna, who is a Barbadian ambassador tasked with promoting education, tourism and investment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/barbados-elects-first-president-to-replace-british-queen/articleshow/87192894.cms||---

---||World||Prosecutor urges jury to convict ex-Giuliani associate on campaign finance charges||NEW YORK: A prosecutor on Thursday urged jurors in federal court to hold former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas "accountable" for campaign finance violations, in a trial over allegedly illicit efforts to conceal donations.  In his closing argument, assistant US attorney Hagan Scotten said the government had demonstrated that Parnas used funds from Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev to contribute to the United States candidates in various state and federal elections. Scotten said Parnas was trying to obtain licences to operate cannabis companies.  "You saw the wires from Muraviev," Scotten told the jury. "You saw how that money came out on the other side, finding its way into American elections, where the defendants thought they had bought influence to further their business."  A Muraviev associate, Andrey Kukushkin, is being tried alongside Parnas.  Defense attorneys also made closing arguments in the trial's ninth day in US District Court in Manhattan.  In his closing statement, Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, characterised his client as a passionate proponent of marijuana legalisation who was "in well over his head". He argued that Muraviev's money funded business operations, not campaign contributions.  Parnas and Kukushkin face two counts of conspiring to make donations from a foreign national, and making the donations. Parnas alone faces four other counts, including making false statements to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).  Parnas, a 49-year-old Florida resident, and Kukushkin, who lives in California, have both pleaded not guilty. Both men are Ukraine-born U.S. citizens.  Prosecutors also accused Parnas of making two contributions through a shell company to conceal that his onetime business partner Igor Fruman was the true source of the funds, and of lying to the FEC about the funds.  Bondy characterized Fruman's funding as a "bona-fide capital investment" in an energy company that Parnas and Fruman started together.  "There was no effort to make a contribution in the name of another, whatsoever," Bondy told jurors.  Fruman, a Belarus-born U.S. citizen who lives in Florida, pleaded guilty in September to one count of soliciting campaign contributions from a foreign national. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 21.  The trial has drawn attention because of the role Parnas and Fruman played in helping Giuliani - former President Donald Trump's former personal attorney - investigate Democrat Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign. Biden won the November election, denying Trump a second term in the White House.  Giuliani's attorney has said the Parnas case is separate from a probe into whether the former New York City mayor violated lobbying laws while representing Trump.  Giuliani, a former New York mayor, has not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/prosecutor-urges-jury-to-convict-ex-giuliani-associate-on-campaign-finance-charges/articleshow/87192967.cms||---
---||World||Syria says it executed 24 for igniting deadly wildfires||DAMASCUS: Syria has executed 24 people after convicting them on terrorism charges for igniting last year's devastating wildfires, leaving three people dead and burning thousands of hectares (acres) of forests, the Justice Ministry said Thursday.  The publicized executions of a large group of people is rare in war-torn Syria, where a decade-old conflict has left hundreds of thousands dead and displaced half the country's population, including 5 million refugees outside the country.  Wildfires broke out in several Middle Eastern countries in October 2020 amid a heat wave that was unusual for that time of the year, leaving Syria particularly hard-hit. Three people were killed in the blazes, which also burned wide areas of forests, mostly in government-controlled regions of Latakia and the central province of Homs.  President Bashar Assad's hometown of Qardaha in Latakia province was hard hit by the fires, which heavily damaged a building used as storage for the state-owned tobacco company, part of which collapsed. Assad made a rare visit to the region shortly after the fire was brought under control.  A statement issued by the Justice Ministry Thursday said those executed a day earlier were "criminals who carried out terrorist attacks that led to deaths and damage to state infrastructure and public and private property through the use of flammable material." It said 11 others were sentenced to life in prison in the same case.  Nine others, including five juveniles, received prison sentences. The prison sentences for the juveniles ranged between 10 to 12 years, the Justice Ministry said.  The statement did not provide further details on the circumstances of the executions or how they took place. For civilians, the death penalty in Syria is usually carried out by hanging. Syrian laws allow for the death penalty for offenses including terrorism, espionage, treason, arson and army desertion.  "Yesterday's executions of 24 people demonstrates the Syrian government's disregard for international law, especially right to life," said Diana Semaan, researcher on Syria for Amnesty International.  She added that death sentences are often passed through secret trials or during court proceedings which lack basic safeguards such as the right to a lawyer, and with confessions routinely extracted under torture or other ill treatment and duress.  In 2017, a report by Amnesty International said as many as 13,000 people were executed in secret mass hangings at the Saydnaya prison in Syria between September 2011 and December 2015, at the height of the Syrian civil war. It said the alleged executions were authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government.  The report said that between 20 and 50 people were hanged each week, sometimes twice a week, at the Saydnaya prison in what the organization called a "calculated campaign of extrajudicial execution." UN human rights experts have also reported the mass killing of detainees held by the government in official and makeshift detention centers that often take place out of sight.  Those executed Wednesday were among dozens of people detained in late 2020 who confessed that they began planning to ignite fires starting in August last year, the Justice Ministry statement said. They started fires in September that affected 280 towns and villages and damaged 370 homes, the ministry added.  It said a total of 24,000 hectares (59,300 acres) of forests and plantation were burnt in the fires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/syria-says-it-executed-24-for-igniting-deadly-wildfires/articleshow/87193315.cms||---

After China, which has administered more than 200 crore doses, India is only the second country to have reached the landmark of 100 crore jabs. While the vaccination graphs of countries with significant populations like the US, Brazil and Indonesia have been largely flat, India’s has been rising steeply. Almost 75% of the eligible population has taken at least the first dose, with eight states and UTs achieving 100% coverage of the first dose. Four more states and UTs have more than 90% coverage of the first dose, according to government data. After a slow start, which saw it take 85 days to administer the first 10 crore (100 million) doses, India almost halved the time taken to reach the next 10 crore to 46 days. The vaccination drive picked up pace thereafter, taking 28 days for the next 10 crore. The shortest time taken to 10 crore was just 11 days (from 70 crore to 80 crore). While it took India a total of 202 days to reach the 50 crore mark after it began giving shots, it took just 76 days more to hit the 100 crore landmark. A record 2.5 crore doses were administered in a single day on September 17, 2021. In cumulative numbers too, India ranks second to China in fully vaccinating over 28 crore of its population, at least 10 crore more than the US and equal to the fully immunised population of Japan, Germany, Russia, France and the UK put together. Read AlsoA billion Covid vaccine doses: India's landmark achievement in 10 chartsIn less than a year since kicking off its ambitious vaccination programme, India on Thursday crossed the significant milestone of administering over 100 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine. A mammoth achievement by all accounts, it took India 279 days to go from inoculating the very first health workerCommemorating the achievement, banners were put up at some central government hospitals and refreshments were distributed among the hospital staff and beneficiaries who had come for vaccination. The Archaeological Survey of India lit up 100 of its heritage monuments in colours of the tricolour to mark the milestone as a tribute to health professionals, frontline workers, scientists, vaccine manufacturers and the citizens of the country who bravely fought the pandemic. Besides that, some mobile networks caller tunes mentioning completion of 100 crore doses was also introduced.

Significantly, while the vaccination graphs of countries with significant populations like the US, Brazil and IndonesiaCalling the achievement historic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed doctors, nurses and all those who had worked tirelessly to enable this moment. "India scripts history. We are witnessing the triumph of Indian science, enterprise and collective spirit of 130 crore Indians. Congrats India on crossing 100 crore vaccinations. Gratitude to our doctors, nurses and all those who worked to achieve this feat. #VaccineCentury",” the PM said in a tweet. “To counter the largest pandemic in 100 years, the country now has a strong protective shield of 100 crore vaccine doses. This achievement belongs to India and its citizens,” said the PM as he inaugurated the Infosys Foundation Vishram Sadan at the National Cancer Institute in the Jhajjar campus of AIIMS via video conferencing. Shah: Jab record signals New India’s capabilities In a statement on Twitter, home minister Amit Shah highlighted that "the milestone has re-acquainted the whole world with the immense capabilities of New India.” He thanked all scientists, researchers and health workers who have contributed in this task by overcoming many challenges. During the course of the day many cabinet ministers joined in as they issued congratulatory messages and thanked the scientists and medical fraternity for enabling the one billion milestone. Read AlsoA word of caution amid cheer: 10 crore 2nd doses overdueNEW DELHI: India’s Covid-19 taskforce chief Dr V K Paul said on Thursday that India achieving the record of vaccinating 100 crore people and that too through vaccines manufactured in India in just nine months was a remarkable feat. He said consistency is important to benefit from this achievement asBJP applauded the vaccination milestone with party president J P Nadda in a press statement asserting that, “within nine months of the setting up of the ‘Vaccine Task Force‘ India successfully developed not one but two world class ‘Made In India‘ Covid vaccines. And now within 278 days, India, under the decisive leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has once again surprised the entire world by reaching the 100 crore mark of the vaccination administered in the country.” Times ViewVaccinating 100 crore is laudable. Everyone associated with the project has reason to celebrate and feel proud. However, the country needs to inject another 88 crore jabs to reach its target of inoculating every adult by the end of 2021. There can be no slackening in the vaccination process.“I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the vaccine manufacturing companies of the country, the workers involved in vaccine transportation and the health sector professionals involved in the vaccination,” Modi said as he spoke about his visit earlier in the day to a vaccination centre at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi. “There is enthusiasm and there is also a sense of responsibility that together we have to defeat Corona as soon as possible.” In a tweet posted on his handle, the PM had shared pictures of his interactions with patients and medical staff on duty at the RML vaccination centre. The PM reminded the audience at the event in Jhajjar about his emphasis on ‘sabka prayas’ (everybody’s effort) during his Independence Day speech from the Red Fort. Modi said healthcare is a great example of how the public and private sector, individuals and social organisations can work together to make a difference.

---||World||Alabama man faces 2nd execution date this year for killing||ATMORE: An Alabama man who avoided execution in February is scheduled to be put to death Thursday for the 1991 killing of a woman taken at gunpoint from an ATM location and shooting her in a cemetery. Willie B. Smith III, 52, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection at 6 pm CDT at a southwest Alabama prison for his conviction in the kidnapping and murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson. Prosecutors said Smith had a shotgun when he abducted Johnson in October 1991 from an ATM location in Birmingham. He withdrew money using her bank card and then took her to a cemetery and shot her in the back of the head. Johnson was the sister of a Birmingham police officer. This is Smith's second execution date this year. Last February 11, while Smith was in a holding cell near Alabama's death chamber, the state called off a lethal injection when the US Supreme Court upheld an injunction affirming he could not be executed unless allowed to have his pastor by his side. The Alabama prison system has now said Smith will be able to have his pastor with him Thursday in the death chamber. Smith's attorneys asked the US Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon to halt the execution plan, arguing Smith has an intellectual disability that prevented him from understanding the prison paperwork related to selection of an execution method. The appeal to the Supreme Court came after the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request for a stay. Experts have estimated Smith's IQ from 64 on the low end and 75 on the high end, but courts have ruled he is eligible for the death penalty. A defense expert in a post-trial appeal said while Smith's IQ was measured at 64, his language, reading and mathematics skills, and that these particular results were inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability. The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that executing intellectually disabled people is unconstitutional. In reviewing Smith's case in 2019, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a later Supreme Court decision that ``states may not weigh a defendant's adaptive strengths against his adaptive deficits'' in determining disability did not retroactively apply to Smith. Last-minute court filings centered on whether Smith should have been given assistance to understand the form distributed to death row inmates in 2018 regarding selection of an execution method. After adopting nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, state law gave inmates a 30-day window to request that as their preferred execution method. If Smith had requested nitrogen hypoxia, his death sentence could not be carried out to date because the state has not yet developed a system for using nitrogen to execute inmates. Smith's attorneys asked the Supreme Court to stay the execution by lethal injection until a trial can be held in his ongoing lawsuit arguing that the Americans with Disabilities Act required him to have assistance in understanding the form. While the 11th Circuit denied the stay request, one member of the three-judge panel sharply criticized Alabama. Circuit Judge Jill Pryor wrote in a concurring opinion the state has acknowledged Smith has ``significantly subaverage intellectual functioning'' and that Smith said he received no explanation of the form related to execution method selection. ``It disturbs me that ADOC, which took on the responsibility to inform prisoners about their right to elect death by nitrogen hypoxia within 30 days, did so in such a feckless way,'' Pryor wrote. The state of Alabama argued Smith had access to his lawyers for help in requesting nitrogen. The Alabama attorney general's office urged the court to let the lethal injection proceed. ``He has been on death row longer than Ms. Johnson was alive,'' lawyers with the Alabama attorney general's office wrote in urging the courts to let the execution proceed. The Department of Corrections changed some procedures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prison system limited media witnesses to the execution to one journalist, a representative from The Associated Press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/alabama-man-faces-2nd-execution-date-this-year-for-killing/articleshow/87193635.cms||---
---||India||Farmers have right to protest but can’t block roads indefinitely, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said farmers have a right to protest against the three new farm laws even when their validity is under challenge before the apex court but was firm in its view that no one could be permitted to block roads indefinitely, impeding the right of citizens to commute without hindrance. Of the 43 farmer unions made parties to a petition seeking removal of farmers staging protests on highways at border points of Delhi with neighbouring states, only four — Rakesh Tikait of Bharatiya Kisan Union, Gurbax Singh of Jaikisan Andolan, Punjab, Balbir Singh of BKU-Rajewal and Hanan Mollah of Kul Hind Kisan Sangharsh Talmel (Coordination) Committee, Delhi — appeared before the court through senior advocate Dushyant Dave and lawyer Prashant Bhushan. Dave first cited a January (2021) order of a three-judge bench of the SC, which had stayed enforcement of farm laws and said that farmers had a right to protest as long as it was peaceful. Second, he sought to raise issues of judicial propriety, saying when the matter is pending before a three-judge bench, a two-judge bench should not take it up. "This bench should send these petitions before the three-judge bench," Dave said. The third limb of his argument was that the farmers have not blocked the roads. "It is police which has erected barricades to prevent them from reaching Ramlila Maidan in Delhi to stage protests against the farm laws. This has caused the road blockade. Why can’t the authorities allow the farmers to stage protests at Ramlila Maidan?" Dave asked. The bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and C T Ravikumar said that the law has been clearly laid down in the Shaheen Bagh case that protesters cannot block roads and highways indefinitely to deprive the right of commuters to move freely. "We are not dealing with the main issue (the validity of the farm laws). We are on a small point — whether protesters can indefinitely block the roads. According to our judgment, the law is already laid down. There is nothing more to be said on the issue," it said. Taking up cudgels with Dave, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Dave and Bhushan had appeared for farmers’ unions before the same three-judge bench and advanced arguments in January 2020. But when it came to the day of passing orders after hearing parties, the two lawyers along with their colleagues were missing from the court, which was recorded in the order. Taking a dig at Dave’s argument to allow farmers to protest at Ramlila Maidan in the heart of Delhi, Mehta said, "Some people should be allowed a permanent residence at Ramlila Maidan." He went on to narrate the violence unleashed on the streets during the tractor rally on Republic Day despite assurances given by Bhushan on behalf of the farmers that the event will be peaceful. Disallowing the proceedings from getting mired in jibes and counters between Dave and the Mehta, the bench said, "Some solution has to be found. Farmers have a right to protest. But the roads cannot be blocked indefinitely as people have a right to travel on them." The bench permitted the four farmer leaders on behalf of their unions to file their responses to the petitions in four weeks. It allowed the Haryana and UP governments to file their rejoinder in two weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on December 7. On the repeated plea of Dave that the two-judge bench should send the present case to the three-judge bench which is seized of the main matter relating to the validity of the three farm laws, the bench said it would consider this argument after the responses were filed. On January 12, four lawyers — Dushyant Dave, Prashant Bhushan, Colin Gonsalves and H S Phoolka — had inexplicably absented themselves before the SC, less than 24 hours after promising to get back with the response of the unions on their willingness to appear before the proposed committee on farm laws. Bhushan, Gonsalves and Phoolka had told a bench headed by then CJI S A Bobde on January 11 that Dave was leading the quartet, who had been engaged by the eight farmers’ unions as counsel to apprise the SC about their views. Dave, who had initially informed the court that the farmers would not hold a tractor rally on Republic Day, had sought time till Tuesday for taking instructions from the farmers on this issue as well. None of the four logged in to the video-conference hearing before the CJI’s court during the nearly one-and-a-half-hour-long proceedings on January 12. The CJI had vented his anguish at the lack of courtesy on the part of four seasoned lawyers to at least appear before the court as promised and apprise it about the stand of the farmers’ unions. "Members of the bar, who are first officers of the court and then the counsel for their clients, are expected to show some loyalty (towards the court). You will appear before the court when it suits you and not come if it does not suit you. You cannot do that," the CJI had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-have-right-to-protest-but-cant-block-roads-indefinitely-says-supreme-court/articleshow/87193671.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

He said, “Theatre is a wonderful thing. It is the greatest temple on earth. In that temple, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jew, Sikh and Parsi all get together. Nobody comes and asks who is in the next chair. All sit together. That is a beautiful way of bringing people together and teaching them how to behave. They would laugh together, cry together. It is the biggest temple that could be built for the benefit of the nation.” And now that the government has sanctioned the opening up of theatres, this sector, which was badly hit during the pandemic, is finally heaving a sigh of relief. Kunal KapoorMumbai’s Prithvi Theatre that is over four decades old is all set to welcome patrons, too. Kunal Kapoor, (Trustee, Prithvi Theatre) says, “Thousands suffered because everything was shut. We are thrilled to be able to open again. No one is happy with restrictions, but we understand the need for certain SOPs. Our only request is that SOPs should be evenly and fairly applied to all. Whatever the authorities think is right in these trying times, we support. We shall reopen on October 24 at 7.30am with Udayswar, an Indian classical concert, and shows in the evening.” We asked him about bringing back theatre festivals and Kunal said, “Any festival of theatre, music, dance, circus is always good. A festival brings with it excitement, joy, and new positive experiences. Theatre is a social experience. The audience will return for this social experience — as was witnessed last December to March when we reopened after the first wave.” Kunal mentioned the need for government intervention to support live performances in the city. He said, “Online performances did not do well. There was a curiosity for them and a desperate need for performers to perform during the first wave. But this withered during the second wave. Nothing can replace the collective experience of watching live performances. Theatres with live performing arts could be supported with lower taxes and GST on tickets. Our numbers are not that many to adversely affect the state’s finances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/prithvi-theatre-all-set-to-open-its-doors-once-more/articleshow/87191466.cms||Debarati S Sen

Among those found dead or fear to have died were nine trekkers, five of them in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. Nainital remained the worst-hit in terms of casualties as the death toll in the district climbed to 34, followed by Champawat district where 11 people have died. Almost 17 teams of NDRF, 60 teams of SDRF, 15 companies of PAC and 5,000 police personnel are still engaged in rescue and relief operations in the Kumaon division. Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said the damage due to floods and landslides over the past few days has been tentatively accessed at Rs 7,000 crore for the state. He added that the loss damages could exceed Rs 10,000 crore once a final estimate is in. A day after 11 climbers — majority of them from West Bengal — who were on a trek from Harsil in Uttarakhand to Chitkul in Himachal Pradesh went missing following heavy snowfall in the region, bodies of five trekkers were recovered in Kinnaur while two were rescued alive. This comes even as four more trekkers — all from Kolkata — were reported to have died during a trek to Sunderdhunga valley in upper Kumaon. Talking about the Sunderdhunga trek, Kapkot (in Bageshwar) sub-divisional magistrate Paritosh Verma told TOI that a porter, Harak Singh, accompanying the six-member team had returned from the trek and informed the administration that four trekkers had been buried alive in the snow while two had gone missing. “We have sent a state disaster response force (SDRF) team as well as a medical team to the site. We have also rescued 42 tourists from the region,” he said. Extreme weather in the two Himalayan states has left hordes of tourists stranded. At least 80 tourists, mostly from West Bengal, Punjab, Delhi and Himachal, have been stranded at Batal in Spiti valley of Himachal since Sunday when heavy snowfall blocked the Manali-Kaza highway. They have taken refuge in two dhabas and a government rest house. More than 100 tourists are currently stranded in Darma and Byas valleys in Uttarakhand and the district administration has decided to airlift them. Himachal Pradesh authorities said that bodies of trekkers would be airlifted to Uttarkashi on Friday as bad weather prevented the chopper sortie on Thursday. A rescue team comprising Army and ITBP personnel in Kinnaur district had recovered the bodies and rescued two climbers. Meanwhile, a fresh western disturbance and is very likely to affect the hill states from October 22 to 24, with fairly widespread rain and snow over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal and Uttarakhand, the met department said. Union home minister Amit Shah, after an aerial survey of the affected areas in Uttarakhand, said that except three roads, traffic movement had started on most stretches. Nainital, Haldwani and Almora roads had been opened to traffic. Railway tracks have suffered heavy damage at one place and repair work has also begun. More than 60% electricity supply has been restored, he said. “In this hour of crisis, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to the Uttarakhand chief minister many times and the central government has put in all its strength to help Devbhoomi,” Shah added. Survey teams of the Ministry of Home Affairs will visit the state to take stock of the damage, he said, adding that an amount of Rs 250 crore has been issued by the Centre to the state a few months ago by the disaster management department. He said the Centre has already released assistance of Rs 749 crore as the Central share under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). More than 3,500 people have been rescued and over 16,000 people have been evacuated to safer places as a precaution, and there are no reports of loss of life of any tourist so far, said Shah.

However, there is a large trade balance in favour of China, and India will continue to raise the issue of widening deficit with China, he added. “At this rate, we are likely to attain the highest-ever bilateral trade between two countries,’’ he said. The total trade volume between the two countries was around $88 billion. The sharp increase in trade follows the military strife in eastern Ladakh and efforts by the government to reduce reliance on Chinese imports along with calls by many to boycott Chinese products. Addressing a seminar on “Leveraging China’s Economy’’, Shringla said the developments along the LAC in eastern Ladakh had seriously disturbed peace and tranquility in border areas and that this had an impact on the broader relationship too. He expressed hope China would work with India for a mutually satisfactory resolution of the military standoff and allow progress in ties, keeping in mind each other’s aspirations, sensitivities and interests. “Our trade deficit concerns are twofold — the first, is the actual size of the deficit. Trade deficit for the nine-month period stood at $47 billion. This is the largest trade deficit we have with any country. Second is the fact that the imbalance has continuously been widening,’’ said Shringla, adding that there were are a number of market access impediments, including a whole host of non-tariff barriers, for most of India’s agricultural products and the sectors Indians are competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, IT/ITES, etc. “We have highlighted that widening deficit and increase in trade barriers are issues of concern. These have been regularly flagged at the highest level, most recently at the 2nd Informal Summit between our Prime Minister and the Chinese President in Chennai in 2019. We also remain firm in our commitment of placing this trade relationship on a more sustainable footing and raising these issues at all appropriate occasions with the Chinese side. Developments since then, including the Covid pandemic, have not been helpful in our efforts to address these concerns," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/trade-with-china-up-49-shringla-red-flags-deficit/articleshow/87193917.cms||---

---||India||Supreme Court reverses HC order, Gauri ‘killers’ to face stringent law||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a Karnataka HC decision and ruled that those accused in the murder case of journalist Gauri Lankesh will face charges under the provisions of the stringent Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes Act (KCOCA) apart from IPC Section 302 and arms and explosives laws. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar said the HC completely misread the provisions of the KCOCA and their employment in a case that prima facie showed characters of an organised crime. The bench added that the HC erred in quashing the charges under the Act against the accused. Lankesh was shot dead on September 5, 2017 in Bengaluru. Her sister and the Karnataka government had appealed before the SC against the HC judgment giving the alleged assailants reprieve from KCOCA. A murder case was initially registered. But after the special investigation team (SIT) took over the probe, it had submitted a report to the chief Investigating officer, who had sought approval of the Bengaluru police commissioner for invoking Section 3 of KCOCA, while opining that it was an organised crime. The necessary approval to invoke KCOCA was given on August 14, 2018.  Justice Khanwilkar said the HC should have inquired whether the factual matrix of the crime, as evident from the investigation, needed invoking KCOCA and not look at the initial FIR which registered the crime as a plain murder case. The bench said, “At the relevant time, the material regarding offence having been committed by an organised crime syndicate was not known. That information came to the fore only after the SIT investigation.” The SC said the high court committed manifest error and exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the chargesheet filed before the competent court on the basis of a writ petition filed regarding offences under KCOCA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-reverses-hc-order-gauri-killers-to-face-stringent-law/articleshow/87193962.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

These engine can run on more than one fuel. Speaking at a function in New Delhi, Gadkari said, “Considering the rising prices of petrol and diesel, alternative fuels are needed. Ethanol, CNG, bio-LNG, and electric are some of the alternatives available. Among them, ethanol is the most affordable.” Gadkari said Vikram Kirloskar of Toyota-Kirloskar Motors had informed him that they were ready to launch Euro-VI-compliant flex engines that can run either on 100% petrol or 100% ethanol. “I have asked the MDs of TVS and Bajaj groups to make two-wheelers that can run on ethanol and they are ready with it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flex-fuel-engines-will-be-must-in-6-months-says-gadkari/articleshow/87194017.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||India||‘Getting funds not NGOs’ fundamental right’||NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that no NGO had a fundamental right to receive funds from abroad and argued that the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) were amended to stop the NGOs from making chain-transfers of foreign funds a business. In its response affidavit to petitions by several NGOs alleging that the new provisions would stifle their fun-ds and consequently impe-de their social work, the Centre said the amended section 7 only restricts transfer of foreign contributions to other persons/NGOs once received in India. “An NGO has to utilise it for the purposes for which it has been given a certificate of registration or prior permission by Government and there is no discrimination against any NGO in receipt of foreign contribution from any foreign donors,” it said. On the difficulty posed to thousands of NGOs spread across India by an amendment mandating opening of bank account only in main branch of SBI in New Delhi for receipt of foreign contributions, the Centre said, “Prohibition on transfer of foreign contribution, receipt of foreign contribution in the main branch of SBI in New Delhi and obtaining Aadhaar number, etc of the office bearers, key functionaries and members would improve compliance mechanism, enhance transparency and accountability in the receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution and would not impinge on any fundamental rights of the petitioners. It is directly relatable to activities/programmes detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of India, public order and interests of general public and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” It said, “There exists no fundamental right under which any right, legal or otherwise, can be said to include the purported right to receive foreign contributions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/getting-funds-not-ngos-fundamental-right/articleshow/87194056.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The SC also asked the Centre to clarify the rationality behind fixing the limit. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna raised questions on how the same income limit of Rs 8 lakh could be fixed for both EWS and Other Backward Classes (OBC) categories to be eligible for reservation and sought an explanation from the government.  It said there is a social and educational backwardness attached with the OBCs and it is presumed that their backwardness subsides with economic advancement. The EWS category, on the other hand, is different and there is no concept of social and educational backwardness, the Supreme Court bench said . Incidentally, at the previous hearing on October 7, the Supreme Court bench had raised the same queries and asked the Centre to come up with its explanation. As the government did not file any reply, the bench passed a formal order directing it to file an affidavit and adjourned the hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-fails-to-explain-basis-for-rs-8-lakh-ews-quota-cap-sc-seeks-affidavit/articleshow/87194099.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Incensed by CBI and ED going after TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee in the coal scam case, West Bengal had raised a Centre-state dispute before the SC, accusing the Centre and its probe agencies of violating federal structure of the country by registering 12 cases in the state despite withdrawal of general consent to CBI in 2018. The state had said that law and order and police were constitutionally put under the state’s exclusive jurisdiction and that registration of cases by the CBI were illegal and a transgression of the constitutionally distributed powers between the Centre and the states. In response to the charges, the Union government said that the suit under Article 131 of the Constitution was filed by West Bengal while suffering from a wrong notion that power to withhold/withdraw general consent is absolute. The Centre said, “In respect to offences that have been committed in ‘railway areas’, it is inconsequential whether the concerned state has accorded its consent or not, as the Constitution and the DSPE Act unequivocally grants the power to investigate in such case to the CBI.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-trying-to-save-accused-bar-on-cbi-wont-apply-centre/articleshow/87194116.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Prime Minister termed Sudha Murthy as modest, easy-going and compassionate towards the poor. His remarks come a few days after the RSS-inspired “Panchjanya” weekly made serious allegations against Infosys saying that the Bengaluru-based company might be deliberately trying to destabilise the Indian economy and accused it of helping ‘Naxals, Leftists and Tukde Tukde gang’. The PM made the remarks on Thursday while inaugurating Infosys Foundation’s Vishram Sadan at the National Cancer Institute on Jhajjar campus of AIIMS via video conference. “I express my gratitude to AIIMS management and the team of Sudha Murthy ji for this service. Sudha ji's personality is very modest and easy-going and she is equally compassionate towards the poor. Her philosophy of ‘Nar Seva as Narayan Seva’ (Service to Humanity is Service to God) and her actions inspire everyone. I commend her for her cooperation in this Vishram Sadan,” Modi said in what was a reiteration of the government's strong rejection of the Panchjanya article. Modi said he was satisfied that many institutions like the Infosys Foundation are helping the poor and making their lives easier in a spirit of service. “And just as Sudha ji has spoken about ‘Patram-Pushpam’ in great detail, I believe it becomes the duty of all the countrymen not to let go of any opportunity to serve,” the PM added. The PM commanded the corporate sector and social organisations which, he said, have continuously contributed in strengthening the health services of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-hails-infosys-sudha-murthy-for-service-to-humanity/articleshow/87194388.cms||---

Significantly, while the vaccination graphs of countries with significant populations like the US, Brazil and Indonesia remain flattish, India’s has been rising steeply. In cumulative numbers, India again ranks second to China in fully vaccinating over 28 crore of its population, at least 10 crore more than the US and equal to the fully immunised population of Japan, Germany, Russia, France and UK put together. China has fully vaccinated 75% of its population with two jabs while in India it is 21%, the US has covered 57%, Japan 67%, Germany 65%, Russia 33%, France and the UK 67% each. World over, 36% of the population have been fully inoculated. India’s doses per 100 population has also gone up to 71, with countries like Cuba and the UAE leading with counts of 207 and 219. As vaccine-tracking websites like ourworldindata.com count doses, including boosters, individually, the same person may receive more than one dose leading to doses per 100 people to be higher than 100. In the seven-day rolling average of shots per 100 population per day, India is .32 with Brazil and Indonesia at .66 and .64 (per 100 people). Worldwide, over 665 crore doses have been administered so far, which included 278 crore people fully jabbed. China has administered 223 crore doses and fully vaccinated at least 104 crore citizens, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center of Johns Hopkins University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-high-on-shots-india-2nd-to-china-58-crore-jabs-ahead-of-us/articleshow/87194417.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||India||A word of caution amid cheer: 10 crore 2nd doses overdue||NEW DELHI: India’s Covid-19 taskforce chief Dr V K Paul said on Thursday that India achieving the record of vaccinating 100 crore people and that too through vaccines manufactured in India in just nine months was a remarkable feat. He said consistency is important to benefit from this achievement as he flagged how even now 25% of eligible adults have not taken the first dose of the vaccine and only 30% have taken the second dose. He also highlighted how the second dose is overdue in case of 10 crore people. Paul said the country’s mission will be complete once all adults are completely vaccinated. “We must see this achievement in a true perspective. Consistency is very important…75% of India’s adult population received both doses, while only 35% are partially vaccinated. It means a great achievement, but at the same time 25% of Indian adults who are eligible to receive free vaccines are still out. Efforts must go forward,” he said. Paul, who is also a member of the Niti Aayog, said everyone, including family members, neighbours, grassroot level workers, the civil society and governments should make efforts to get the remaining citizens to vaccination centres. “Two doses have been given to about 30% of Indians, which is fine. But what is concerning is that about 10 crore individuals are now overdue. They should have received a second dose but they have not. So it is now unfinished work that we must accomplish to ensure that those eligible receive the second dose. People should be reminded... We must continue to push the frontier that the first dose reaches universal coverage and we must continue to push the frontier that the second dose coverage also reaches 100%,” Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-word-of-caution-amid-cheer-10-crore-2nd-doses-overdue/articleshow/87194457.cms||---

The Pune-based company hopes to resume exports of its vaccine, Covishield to WHObacked global platform, Covax by November, he told TOI in an interview, on a day when India crossed a milestone of one billion vaccinations. On ensuring supplies for a ‘booster’ for those who have taken both the shots, he said those who haven’t taken the first jab in India (or elsewhere) need to be prioritised. “We will have enough doses available for a booster shot for the elderly, and those who need it. For the healthy and young population we can wait for a year or so before considering a booster dose, and first ensure that the rest of the population gets two doses’’, he said. The country is in a good place with a buffer stock of three weeks, he said, adding vaccine stocks monthly have surpassed the rate of vaccination. The share of Covishield licenced by AstraZeneca to SII, stands at over 85% in India immunisation programme. “Other manufacturers like Bharat Biotech are scaling up, while others like Zydus will add to overall vaccine security. I would not like to make any prediction in terms of specific numbers’’, he added. Regarding resuming exports which are crucial for lower- and middle-income countries, he said the government and Serum are working to see if there are enough stocks, but exports could start by November. We had to pay damages of $100 m(on reneging and delaying export contracts). We hope to make profits now (through exports), with January maybe seeing larger exports. We plan to export Novavax’s vaccine, Covavax, next year if the domestic requirement is met, and Sputnik Light once it has been approved by regulators’’, he said. Poonawalla said the company’s production of the vaccine could go up to 240 million doses a month from around 220 million now. Earlier, the company was rolling out about 100-110 million doses per month. This was possible with meticulous planning, coordination and support from the government, he said. The advance order which gave us about Rs 1,500 crore helped us to scale up, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-have-enough-doses-for-booster-shots-says-poonawalla/articleshow/87194629.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The 33-year-old homemaker is tightening her purse strings and altering her spending habits, thanks to soaring costs of fuel, transport and many manufactured items, coupled with stagnant incomes due to the pandemic. "Earlier we used to get four or five boxes of dry fruits during festivals, but now we hardly get one or two. Because of the high prices," said Milind, adding that her family has reduced spending on food too by cutting back on meat to just once a week compared to several times a week earlier. Millions of households are facing similar strains on their budgets ahead of Diwali, which this year falls in early November and marks the country's busiest shopping season for consumer goods. Many are foregoing big-ticket purchases such as television sets and jewellery this festive season, according to half a dozen people Reuters spoke to and a consumer survey by Mumbai-based consultancy Axis My India, threatening to slow an economy recovering strongly from the worst of Covid-19. Pump prices of petrol and diesel are up nearly 35% from a year ago and cooking gas by more than 50%, severely hitting more than three-quarters of households, economists said. "The sky-rocketing prices of petrol, cooking gas are unbearable when our earnings are still down by nearly 30% from the pre-pandemic period," said Sultan Singh Tomar, 53, who supplies incense sticks and kitchenware to shops in New Delhi on his scooter. He said his petrol bill was up by Rs 600 ($8) from a year ago and refilling the cooking gas cylinder was costlier by Rs 400. Tomar is among millions of people working in the informal sector who dipped into savings during the pandemic and are now forced to pare back household spending. For months consumer-price-based inflation stayed above the central-bank's comfort level of 6% driven by a rise in food prices. In September the consumer price index eased to 4.35%, helped by a softening of food prices which make up nearly half of the index. Economists said that painted a better picture than what households are actually facing. According to an October report by Axis My India on consumer spending trends, more than 88% of respondents in a survey said they will not be buying air conditioners, televisions, washing machines or jewellery this festival season and nearly half said they will make low-ticket purchases such as clothes. There is not much that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government can do to alleviate the pain as global crude oil prices hit a three-year high at $85 a barrel, piling up the pressure on a country that imports 80% of its oil. Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at industry chamber, Confederation of Indian Industries, said the Central and state governments should cut fuel taxes, the highest among the major economies, as higher fuel prices posed a risk of building up of medium term inflationary pressures. "(Otherwise) corporate earnings will be impacted in sectors where producers are unable to pass on the cost increases," she said, adding global shortages were already driving up commodity costs for many products. Reduced footfalls Private economists have warned that annual wholesale-price-based inflation - a proxy for producers' prices - staying in double digits for sixth months in a row could further fuel inflationary pressures as companies pass on rising costs to consumers. Already some retailers said rising raw material costs were impacting their sales. "Our sales are not even half of what we used to have during the festival period," said Kawaljit Singh, who sells utensils from a shop in Chandani Chowk in the old quarter of Delhi. He said a rise in prices of metals like steel and copper had pushed up prices of utensils, cookers, festival lighting and gift items by 15%-20% in the last four-five months. Because of rising prices and other market uncertainties, Delhi-based company auditor Lalit Vats said his family had downgraded to non-branded products and visited the wholesale markets to hunt for bargains. "Government can talk about easing of inflation, but people know that costs of every item has gone up," lamented his mother Anita Vats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/soaring-prices-dampen-consumer-mood-in-festival-season/articleshow/87193598.cms||---
---||World||Capitol insurrection was about 'white supremacy': Biden at Martin Luther King Jr memorial||NEW DELHI: Addressing a celebration to mark the 10th anniversary of the dedication of the Martin Luther King Junior memorial on Washington's National Mall, United States President Joe Biden on Thursday attributed the January 6 Capitol insurrection by a pro-Trump mob to “white supremacy”. “The violent deadly insurrection on Capitol, around nine months ago was result of 'white supremacy',” said Biden who used the backdrop of the memorial to the slain African-American civil rights hero to charge Republicans with following former president Donald Trump into a "deep black hole" of white supremacy and voter suppression. "They're following my predecessor, the last president, in a deep, deep black hole," Biden said, citing "a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion". Biden alleged Republican state representatives, ranging from governors to officials in charge of overseeing elections, have launched "an unrelenting assault" on access to free elections ahead of next year's midterm legislative poll and the 2024 presidential vote. As Trump continues to press his unprecedented bid to discredit Biden's win in the 2020 election, Biden said the white supremacy that King fought before being assassinated in 1968 had never fully gone away. "It only hides until some seemingly legitimate person breathes some oxygen under the rocks where they're hiding..." In a reference to Trump, Biden said, "We had a president who appealed to the prejudice," adding, "We cannot and must not give hate any safe harbour." Biden was speaking a day after the US Senate Republicans blocked a voting rights bill. It was the third time this year that Senate Democrats had tried to advance such a bill in response to new state balloting restrictions fuelled by Republican Trump's false claims of a stolen 2020 presidential election. He singled out Martin Luther King Jr.'s native Georgia, a state that Trump falsely said he lost due to voter fraud. The Democratic president has set a strong agenda for Black Americans, but since taking office in January has not been able to push through voting rights and police reform laws in the face of solid Republican opposition. ‘Country has reached an inflection point on issues like voting restrictions’Biden also tied his legislative priorities on voting rights, police reform and climate change to King's push for racial justice. Invoking King, Biden said the country was still working to live up to its ideals as a nation and had reached an inflection point on issues, including fighting voting restrictions. "I know that progress does not come fast enough," Biden said. "It never has." He reiterated that protecting the right to vote was "central" to his administration. Biden has promised to push for the legislation, but supporters are growing impatient that he has not embraced changing Senate rules. Biden also promised to "continue to fight for real police reform legislation", which has stalled out in Congress after bipartisan talks collapsed this summer. Highlighting his agenda of social spending, which remains the subject of heated intraparty negotiations, Biden said the bill would cut prescription drug costs, reduce poverty and fight housing discrimination. "We can afford to do this," Biden said. "We can't afford not to do this." Biden is hoping to rally Democrats around an agreement on that legislation before he departs for an international climate summit next week. Biden appeared at the memorial tribute with Kamala Harris, the first Black and Asian-American woman Vice President. Monument dedicated to a man whose voice we still hear: HarrisVice President Kamala Harris, who introduced Biden at the event, praised King as a "prophet". "This monument, whatever your age, is dedicated to a man whose voice we still hear, whose words still echo not only across this city, but throughout our country and our world," she said. The massive granite monument, dedicated in the fall of 2011, is the first honour for an African-American on the National Mall. Located on Independence Avenue along the Tidal Basin, the memorial features a huge likeness of King carved out of stone and a separate wall etched with some of his most notable quotes.

The video posted on social media shows Wilson Joseph dressed in a blue suit, carrying a blue hat and wearing a large cross around his neck.  "I swear by thunder that if I don't get what I'm asking for, I will put a bullet in the heads of these Americans," he said in the video.  He also threatened Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the chief of Haiti's National Police, Leon Charles, as he spoke in front of the open coffins that apparently held several members of his gang who were recently killed.  "You guys make me cry. I cry water. But I'm going to make you guys cry blood," he said.  Earlier this week, authorities said that the gang was demanding $1 million per person, although it wasn't immediately clear that included the five children in the group, among them an 8-month-old. Sixteen Americans and one Canadian were abducted, along with their Haitian driver.  The missionaries are with Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, which held a news conference before someone posted the video of the gang leader.  Weston Showalter, spokesman for the religious group, said that the families of those who'd been kidnapped are from Amish, Mennonite and other conservative Anabaptist communities in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Ontario, Canada. He read a letter from the families, who weren't identified by name, in which they said, "God has given our loved ones the unique opportunity to live out our Lord's command to love your enemies."  The group invited people to join them in prayer for the kidnappers as well as those kidnapped and expressed gratitude for help from "people that are knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with" such situations.  "Pray for these families," Showalter said. "They are in a difficult spot."  The gang leader's death threat added to the already intense concern in and around Holmes County, Ohio, where Christian Aid Ministries is based and has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Amish, conservative Mennonite and related groups. Many members of those groups have supported the organization through donations or by volunteering at its warehouse.  "These kinds of things erase some of the boundaries that exist within our circles," added Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in Millersburg.  "Many people in the community feel helpless, but they also realize the power of prayer and the power of our historic theology," he said, including the Anabaptist belief in nonresistance to violence.  The same day that the missionaries were kidnapped, a gang also abducted a Haiti university professor, according to a statement that Haiti's ombudsman-like Office of Citizen Protection issued on Tuesday. It also noted that a Haitian pastor abducted earlier this month has not been released despite a ransom being paid.  "The criminals ... operate with complete impunity, attacking all members of society," the organization said.  UNICEF said Thursday that the number of women and children kidnapped in the first eight months of this year has surpassed the total for all of last year.  "Nowhere is safe for children in Haiti anymore," Jean Gough, UNICEF regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement. "Whether on their way to school, at home or even at church, girls and boys are at risk of being kidnapped anywhere, at any time of the day or night."  UNICEF said 71 women and 30 children were kidnapped this year, up from 59 women and 37 children last year.  "They represent one third of the 455 kidnappings reported this year," the agency said.  Meanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads and burned tires in Haiti's capital to decry a severe fuel shortage and a spike in insecurity and to demand that the prime minister step down.  The scattered protest took place across the Delmas neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.  In addition to kidnappings, the gangs also are blamed for blocking gas distribution terminals and hijacking supply trucks, which officials say has led to a shortage of fuel. Many gas stations now remain closed for days at a time, and the lack of fuel is so dire that the CEO of Digicel Haiti announced on Tuesday that 150 of its 1,500 branches countrywide are out of diesel.  "Nothing works!" complained Davidson Meiuce, who joined Thursday's protest. "We are suffering a lot."  Some protestors held up signs including one that read, "Down with the high cost of living."  Demonstrators clashed with police in some areas, with officers firing tear gas that mixed with the heavy black smoke rising from burning tires that served as barricades.  Alexandre Simon, a 34-year-old English and French teacher, said he and others are protesting because Haitians are facing such dire situations.  "There are a lot of people who cannot eat," he said. "There is no work ... There are a lot of things we don't have."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/haiti-gang-leader-threatens-to-kill-kidnapped-american-missionaries/articleshow/87194887.cms||---

The video posted on social media shows Wilson Joseph dressed in a blue suit, carrying a blue hat and wearing a large cross around his neck.  "I swear by thunder that if I don't get what I'm asking for, I will put a bullet in the heads of these Americans," he said in the video.  He also threatened Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the chief of Haiti's National Police, Leon Charles, as he spoke in front of the open coffins that apparently held several members of his gang who were recently killed.  "You guys make me cry. I cry water. But I'm going to make you guys cry blood," he said.  Earlier this week, authorities said that the gang was demanding $1 million per person, although it wasn't immediately clear that included the five children in the group, among them an 8-month-old. Sixteen Americans and one Canadian were abducted, along with their Haitian driver.  The missionaries are with Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, which held a news conference before someone posted the video of the gang leader.  Weston Showalter, spokesman for the religious group, said that the families of those who'd been kidnapped are from Amish, Mennonite and other conservative Anabaptist communities in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Ontario, Canada. He read a letter from the families, who weren't identified by name, in which they said, "God has given our loved ones the unique opportunity to live out our Lord's command to love your enemies."  The group invited people to join them in prayer for the kidnappers as well as those kidnapped and expressed gratitude for help from "people that are knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with" such situations.  "Pray for these families," Showalter said. "They are in a difficult spot."  The gang leader's death threat added to the already intense concern in and around Holmes County, Ohio, where Christian Aid Ministries is based and has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Amish, conservative Mennonite and related groups. Many members of those groups have supported the organization through donations or by volunteering at its warehouse.  "These kinds of things erase some of the boundaries that exist within our circles," added Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in Millersburg.  "Many people in the community feel helpless, but they also realize the power of prayer and the power of our historic theology," he said, including the Anabaptist belief in nonresistance to violence.  The same day that the missionaries were kidnapped, a gang also abducted a Haiti university professor, according to a statement that Haiti's ombudsman-like Office of Citizen Protection issued on Tuesday. It also noted that a Haitian pastor abducted earlier this month has not been released despite a ransom being paid.  "The criminals ... operate with complete impunity, attacking all members of society," the organization said.  UNICEF said Thursday that the number of women and children kidnapped in the first eight months of this year has surpassed the total for all of last year.  "Nowhere is safe for children in Haiti anymore," Jean Gough, UNICEF regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement. "Whether on their way to school, at home or even at church, girls and boys are at risk of being kidnapped anywhere, at any time of the day or night."  UNICEF said 71 women and 30 children were kidnapped this year, up from 59 women and 37 children last year.  "They represent one third of the 455 kidnappings reported this year," the agency said.  Meanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads and burned tires in Haiti's capital to decry a severe fuel shortage and a spike in insecurity and to demand that the prime minister step down.  The scattered protest took place across the Delmas neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.  In addition to kidnappings, the gangs also are blamed for blocking gas distribution terminals and hijacking supply trucks, which officials say has led to a shortage of fuel.

There have been two other cases of doctors getting infected thrice with Covid. After first being infected, the Pune man had moderate levels of antibodies two weeks after recovering when he tested negative. He took the first dose of Covishield and subsequently the second dose four weeks later. A month after receiving the second dose, he again tested positive. Both reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infections seem to be more pronounced in healthcare workers due to their high exposure to Covid patients. The research team is from Pune-based Dr DY Patil Medical College, and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi. The research team came across this case in April.Dr Vinod Scaria, principal scientist at CSIR-IGIB, told TOI that the Pune man’s was an extremely rare case of reinfection after a patient developed hybrid immunity following Covid infection and full vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rarest-of-rare-man-reinfected-with-delta-after-full-vaccination/articleshow/87194940.cms||Neha Madaan

Tharoor also said after “severe mismanagement” of the second wave and “botching” the vaccination orders that might have prevented it, the government has now “partly redeemed itself”. India achieved a major milestone in its vaccination programme as the cumulative vaccine doses administered in the country surpassed the 100-crore mark on Thursday. Tharoor tweeted,”this is a matter of pride for all Indians. Let’s give the Government credit”. Tagging Tharoor’s tweet, Khera, a Congress spokesperson, said giving credit to “the government is an insult to millions of families who suffered and are still suffering from the after-effects and side effects of widespread Covid mismanagement. Before seeking credit, PM must apologise to those families. The credit belongs to scientists & medical fraternity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-vaxcillates-as-tharoor-lauds-govt-khera-says-insult-to-victims/articleshow/87194968.cms||---

The advertisement, stressing road safety and social awareness, was issued by CEAT tyre company as part of a series. The company did not comment on the matter. Hegde, a former minister in the Union Cabinet, wrote to CEAT MD and CEO Anant Vardhan Goenka on October 14, saying the company’s concern for public issues is to be applauded but along with raising awareness around bursting of firecrackers on roads, it needs to address “blocking (of) roads in the name of namaaz on Fridays and other important festive days by Muslims”. Times ViewIn times when environment pollution has reached alarming levels in many cities, it is sensible to urge people to refrain from bursting crackers. Such advertisements should be encouraged, not discouraged.“It is a very common scene in many Indian cities where Muslims block busy roads and perform namaaz. At that time, ambulances and firefighter vehicles are also stuck in traffic, causing grave losses,” Hegde said. The letter, posted on Facebook, drew angry responses for and against the MP’s comments across social media. The MP said the advertisement is creating “unrest among the Hindus”, and hoped that the company will respect “Hindu sentiment” in the future. He also urged Goenka to highlight the issue of noise pollution in the company’s advertisements. “Every day, loud noise is emitted from mikes arranged on top of mosques in our country during azan. That sound is beyond permissible limits. On Fridays, it is prolonged for some more time. It is causing great inconvenience to people suffering from different ailments...people working in different establishments and teachers teaching in classrooms,” he wrote. In an indirect reference to Aamir Khan, the letter said, “Nowadays, a group of anti-Hindu actors always hurt Hindu sentiments whereas they never try to expose the wrongdoings of their community.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aamir-khans-advertisement-on-firecrackers-creating-unrest-among-hindus-bjp-mp/articleshow/87195033.cms||---

Another eight-year-old child has also been arrested for helping the other two allegedly murder the girl. Police have also arrested the father of one of the children for trying to conceal the crime and destroy evidence. The girl, a neighbour of the three children, was found unconscious inside the toilet of a stone crushing plant in front of her house in Kaliabor. She was taken to a hospital where doctors declared her brought dead, the police said on Thursday. The incident occurred on October 18 and the police made the arrests on Wednesday. “The disturbing thing in this case was the use of pornography by minors,” Nagaon superintendent of police Anand Mishra said. “Two of the boys first tried to replicate the pornograpic acts they had been watching on their mobiles and tried to molest their neighbour’s girl. When she resisted and threatened to tell her parents, they hit her head with a stone and carried her to the toilet in the crusher plant where they hit her again with the stone on her chest. The third child stood guard outside the toilet,” Kaliabor sub-divisional police officer Mrinmoy Das claimed. The three juveniles, who were produced before the juvenile justice board, have been sent to the Jorhat juvenile correctional facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/2-porn-addict-kids-kill-girl-in-assam-for-refusing-to-replicate-sexual-acts/articleshow/87195066.cms||Prabin Kalita

Shiraz had married Atrayee Sengupta in January 2020. This is the first year that Atrayee celebrated Lakshmi Puja at their Ranikuthi residence. Atrayee told TOI that she had grown up watching her mother offer prayers to goddess Lakshmi. “I am happy that Shiraz supported me when I expressed a desire to perform this puja. My mother would perform the puja herself and read the ‘panchali’. I did the same on Wednesday. We want our child to grow up in an environment where he respects all religions,” she said. Though many appreciated the puja photo Shiraz clicked and shared as his Facebook story, trolls jumped into the fray. “I was upset and disappointed to find a family friend from Bangladesh ridiculing my gesture. I do not support such behaviour. That’s why I wrote a post stating that whoever believes that this is the way to stand up for any community should unfriend me. They should not connect with me or my family in future,” Shiraz told TOI. Condemning the incidents of violence during Durga Puja in Bangladesh, the great grandson of Baba Allauddin Khan pointed out that it is “significant” that this Lakshmi Puja was held just days after that incident. “Our puja sends out the right message about what I believe in. I am glad that not only Hindus, many Muslim friends on my social media have also supported me,” he said. The young sarod player mentions the influence of his grandmother — Zubeida Khan — who he said had taught him to respect all religions. “She introduced me to the worship of Hindu gods and goddesses, including Ma Saraswati and Ma Kali. Though my great grandfather was a practicing Muslim who would offer namaaz five times a day, he also worshipped Ma Sarada,” said Shiraz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/trolled-for-lakshmi-puja-pics-ali-akbars-grandson-hits-back/articleshow/87195121.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||World||India, China will play critical roles in determining trajectory of temperature rise: US intel agencies||WASHINGTON: Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, an assessment of US intelligence agencies has said that India and China will play critical roles in determining the trajectory of temperature rise. America's National Intelligence Council, in its latest national intelligence estimate report on Thursday, noted that geopolitical tensions are likely to grow as countries increasingly argue about how to accelerate the reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals. Debate will center on who bears more responsibility to act and to pay, and how quickly, and countries will compete to control resources and dominate new technologies required for the clean energy transition. Most countries will face difficult economic choices and probably will count on technological breakthroughs to rapidly reduce their net emissions later. “China and India will play critical roles in determining the trajectory of temperature rise,” said the report released by the National Intelligence Council ahead of the the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. The report said that China and India are the first- and fourth-largest emitters respectively, and both are growing their total and per capita emissions, whereas the US and the EU, as the second- and third-largest, are declining. “Both China and India are incorporating more renewable and low-carbon energy sources, but several factors will limit their displacement of coal. “They need to modernise their grids, have sunk costs that make it relatively cheaper to use coal compared with other energy sources, want to minimise reliance on fuel imports for national security reasons and are trying to appease domestic constituencies who rely on the coal industry for jobs,” the report said. China accounts for about 30 per cent of global emissions and has pledged to peak before 2030, but modest emissions reduction targets in its 14th Five Year Plan (2021–2025) in 2021 put that into question. “China has not publicly articulated detailed plans for meeting its 2060 net-zero-emissions target; to do so, we assess that Beijing would need to follow through on President Xi Jinping's pledge at the US Climate Summit in April to phase out coal consumption. “India almost certainly will increase its emissions as it develops economically. Indian officials have not committed to a net-zero target date and have instead called on countries with larger economies to reduce emissions,” the report said. The Council judged that transboundary tensions probably will increase over shared surface and groundwater basins as increased weather variability exacerbates pre-existing or triggers new water insecurity in many parts of the world. Climate change effects on local and regional weather, including loss of glaciers and more frequent and extreme droughts and floods, will make water management, resource allocation and service provision more complex and difficult, and probably more contentious. “Although scientific forecasts are not precise enough to pinpoint likely flashpoints, we assess that several areas are at high risk,” it said. “Pakistan relies on downstream surface water from heavily glacier-fed rivers originating in India for much of its irrigation and requires frequent data from India on river discharges in order to provide advanced warning to evacuate villages and prepare for flooding,” said the report. The Mekong River basin already is an area of growing dispute over dam building, largely by China, that threatens the smooth flow of water for agriculture and fishing on which other countries rely heavily, particularly Cambodia and Vietnam, it said. According to the report, the US intelligence community has identified 11 countries and two regions of great concern from the threat of climate change. These countries of concern are highly vulnerable to the physical effects and lack the capacity to adapt, suggesting that building resilience to climate change in these countries would be especially helpful in mitigating future risks to US interests. “Five of the 11 countries are in South and East Asia -- Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), India, Pakistan and North Korea; four countries are in Central America and the Caribbean -- Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua; Colombia and Iraq round out the list,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/india-china-will-play-critical-roles-in-determining-trajectory-of-temperature-rise-us-intel-agencies/articleshow/87195212.cms||---
---||Business||Critical shortage of chips hits life-saving medtech devices||MUMBAI: The severe shortage of semiconductor chips is now going to hit where it hurts — critical life-saving devices and the medtech industry. The growing uncertainty and supply disruptions of chips globally has already led to an increase in prices of certain devices, with some facing stockouts across the country. But more importantly, the shortages now threaten availability of hundreds of chip-powered critical care and ICU devices including ventilators, defibrillators, imaging machines, glucose, ECG, blood pressure monitors and implantable pacemakers. By year-end, the impact on stocks could get worse, and overall prices are expected to go up as high as 20%, medtech players told TOI. So far, the spotlight has been on the impact of chips’ shortage on high-profile, consumer driven sectors like automobiles and electronics. Already, the lead time in manufacturing of chips has jumped from the earlier four-to-eight weeks to 30-40 weeks now and, in certain components, even 100 weeks. This has disrupted delivery schedules of manufacturers, leading to huge delays. At present, we are able to manage the demand and hold the prices of the devices. The uncertainty is, however, growing and an acute shortage may hit us by yearend when existing stocks of microprocessor chips may get depleted,” said Sunil Khurana, CEO & MD of BPL Medical Technologies, which sells anaesthesia machines, patient monitors and ICU ventilators. For instance, the market has already run out of devices like patient monitors, defibrillators and ECGs that use touchscreens. The chips are sourced from domestic vendors who import these from China, Japan, Taiwan and the US. “The industry has sensitised the Centre several times since 2012 about the need to build our semiconductor fabrication plants to become truly ‘Atma Nirbhar’ in electronics and medtech. In the mid-’90s, we had a robust and vibrant computer hardware sector. Thereafter, it was neglected. We were caught sleeping while China had a clear executable strategy. It’s time to look at this with priority. If we don’t have time to invent, we could blindly copy the China hardware model. It’s late but still possible to be fairly ‘Atma Nirbhar’ in 10 years if there is a separate ministry for self-reliance and a non-political experts’ panel,” said Vishwaprasad Alva, MD of Skanray Technologies, manufacturer of critical care and ICU equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/critical-shortage-of-chips-hits-life-saving-medtech-devices/articleshow/87195243.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

From Janaury 1, the Google Play Store will charge third-party subscription apps a 15% commission, the company said Thursday.  Previously, subscription apps were charged 30% for the first year, then 15% thereafter. Google also charged 15% for the first $1 million in revenue. Google said it’s making the change because “customer churn makes it challenging for subscription businesses to benefit” from getting a discount in the second year. “Digital subscriptions have become one of the fastest-growing models for developers, but we know that subscription businesses face specific challenges in customer acquisition and retention,” Sameer Samat, a VP at Google, said in a blog post The company also faces broader criticism that the Google and Apple app stores have grown too powerful and force developers to play by restrictive rules. Apple also charges 15% for subscriptions after the first year, but hasn’t lowered the cut from 30% in year one. Shares of subscription apps rallied on the news. Bumble and Match Group, two developers of dating services, gained as much as 11%. Music streaming giant Spotify rose 5%. Google Play apps that aren’t subscription-based will still have to share 30% of their revenue, but that drops to 15% for the first $1 million in revenue as well. Google says that 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/google-to-halve-app-subscription-fee-to-15/articleshow/87195279.cms||---

In early August this year, the stock exchanges had warned brokers not to deal in digital gold. Digital gold products are electronic receipts proving investments in the yellow metal by investors but not actual gold. Instead, the original sellers of such digital gold investment products keep physical gold in vaults. The product is similar to gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) units. But, unlike ETFs launched by fund houses and regulated by Sebi, digital gold receipts are yet to get the regulatory nod. It has come to the notice of Sebi that some registered investment advisers are engaged in unregulated activity by providing a platform for buying/selling/dealing in unregulated products including digital gold. Undertaking such unregulated activity including dealing (that is advisory, distribution and execution/implementation services) in digital gold by investment advisers is not in accordance with rules,” Sebi said through a press release on Thursday. The markets regulator advised investment advisers to refrain from undertaking such unregulated activities. “Any dealing in unregulated activities by investment advisers may entail action as deemed appropriate” under Sebi rules and regulations In August, through a release, the NSE had said that some of its members were providing platforms to their clients for buying and selling of digital gold. Earlier, Sebi had informed exchanges that facilitating trading in digital gold was in contravention of securities laws. The exchange asked its members to refrain from undertaking such activities and members who were engaged in such trading were asked to stop the same by September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-warns-financial-advisers-against-dealing-in-e-gold/articleshow/87195459.cms||---

Interestingly, apart from NDA, both the alliance partners have locked horns in this bypoll. Congress research committee head Anand Madhab while talking to TOI said that Kanhaiya, Hardik and Jignesh will be given a grand welcome on Thursday at Sadaqat Ashram. Congress is also set to get the support of Jan Adhikar Party chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav in this bypoll. Even the elder Yadav scion, Tej Pratap, has officially announced to back Congress at Kusheshwar Asthan, leaving his brother alone in the battle field. However, CPI(ML) on Wednesday said its leaders Mahboob Alam and Satyadev Ram will be campaigning for the RJD. Apart from roping in various star campaigners, both the Congress and the RJD leaders are also busy in verbal duel. On Wednesday, the grand old party called itself an ocean and compared RJD with a drain or rivulet which ultimately merges in the ocean. Congress women cell head Amita Bhushan also slammed RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha and said that one cannot become a leader simply by reading books and making tall talks. She also held Tejashwi responsible for not abiding by the ‘gathbandhan dharma’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kanhaiya-jignesh-hardik-to-campaign-from-tomorrow/articleshow/87192169.cms||Sheezan Nezami

As many as 90 cases, which were mostly from Patna City, Kankerbagh, Pirbahore, Bakerganj, Transport Nagar, and Patliputra, have been reported here so far. Many residents told this reporter that stagnation of water in many localities was leading to vector-borne diseases. They also alleged that the amount of fogging was negligible. Subodh Goel, a chartered accountant and resident of Bandar Bagicha, said he had not seen fogging vehicles for almost a month. “Fogging should be done timely after a short interval to keep the area clean. The civic body should take preventive measures to control the breeding of mosquitoes especially after rainfall,” he added. “The health department and the civic body say that fogging has been intensified in different areas, but I have not seen it,” claimed Pallavi Asmita, a resident of Kadamkuan. Swapnil, a resident of Patliputra Colony, pointed out, “We keep the doors and windows closed as a precautionary measure. The number of mosquitoes has increased in my area. Hence, fogging and anti-larval operations should be done once a week in every locality especially after monsoon.” Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said the cases of dengue had started rising after the monsoon season. Rakesh Kumar Singh, executive officer of Bankipore circle, claimed that they covered the 12 wards on a roaster basis. “We are trying to cover as many areas as possible at least once a week. We are also responding to the complaints that we receive from the residents,” he told this newspaper. The executive officer of Kankerbagh circle, S B Prasad, said, anti-larval operation is a regular exercise in places which are close to open drains. “Bleaching powder has been sprayed in areas where there is stagnant water. Fumigation is done on roaster basis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnaites-request-authorities-to-intensify-anti-larval-operations/articleshow/87190996.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to the data shared by the Union government, Bihar stood at the sixth position on Thursday evening after administering over 6.37 crore Covid vaccine doses to the beneficiaries. Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, was at the top position by vaccinating 12.30 crore people. Maharashtra (9.38 crore), West Bengal (6.92 crore), Gujarat (6.79 crore), and Madhya Pradesh (6.77 crore) also figured on the list. With this, the total number of Covid vaccine doses administered in India crossed the 100-crore milestone. State health minister Mangal Pandey congratulated all the healthcare and frontline workers for achieving such a milestone. Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing free vaccines to everyone and chief minister Nitish Kumar for his guidance throughout the pandemic, he said, “By December 31, over 8 crore doses will be administered in Bihar.” Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah called it a historic feat for the country. “Nearly 75% of the eligible population has been vaccinated with the first dose and 31% with the second dose,” he said, hoping the vaccination of children would begin soon. Appreciating the efforts of healthcare workers across the nation, state health department’s additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said, “Today is a big day and we salute all the healthcare workers for their tremendous job.” He added, “The work related to Covid-19 vaccination is going on at full speed. We want to wrap it up by December-end. This means all the eligible beneficiaries will be administered with both the doses.” State health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said several rounds of big campaigns along with regular vaccination helped them vaccinate a large number of people. “We will try to give at least the first dose of vaccine to all the beneficiaries by Chhath,” said Singh. He further said in the recent past, the number of beneficiaries for the second dose was increasing. Interestingly, the number of doses administered to female beneficiaries in Bihar is more than their male counterparts while in other states, females are lagging behind men in vaccination. The break up for Bihar shows that while 3.18 crore doses have been administered to males, females are a little ahead with 3.19 crore doses. However, as per the national average, 51.87 crore doses have been administered to males and 48.18 crore doses to females.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-stands-6th-among-states-to-administer-highest-covid-vaccine-doses/articleshow/87190939.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Additionally, it related to a supply that had already been completed as on the date of the application instead of being undertaken or proposed to be undertaken. In this case, the Mumbai company — USV — had entered into an assignment deed dated November 30, 2019, with Novartis, a Switzerland-based pharma company. The latter had agreed to permanently transfer the trademark rights related to the Indian territory for ‘Jalra’ and ‘Jalra M’. The effective date of the transfer was either December 10, 2019 or the date of the receipt of the entire consideration by the Swiss company, whichever is later. USV paid full consideration in two tranches before this date. It filed an application with the AAR on whether the activity of transfer of the registered trademarks by Novartis to itself was a supply of goods or a supply of services. Other questions on which the ruling was sought stemmed from the first one. The AAR pointed out that there are two conditions to be fulfilled for making an advance ruling application: First, the question asked should be in relation to supply undertaken by the ‘applicant’. Second, the question should be in relation to the supply of goods or services or both “being undertaken or proposed to be undertaken by the applicant”. In this case, it was Novartis that was undertaking the supply. Thus, the first condition was not met. Second, the effective date of the transfer of the trademark was December 10, 2019 whereas the application was filed on January 16, 2020. As a result, on the date of filing, the supply was already completed. The applicant and the application did not meet the conditions prescribed under the GST law and hence the application was rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/only-goods-supplier-can-seek-gst-advance-ruling/articleshow/87192840.cms||Lubna Kably

Since TDP is not contesting the elections, BJP leaders are reaching out to the yellow brigade to give a fight to YSRC. Although BJP is not a considerable force in the constituency, the party wants to prove that it has strength to take on YSRC. “We are capable of defeating YSRC. The presence of so many ministers and legislators itself shows the ruling party is worried about BJP’s growing strength,” said Somu Veerraju, state president, BJP. Veerraju is in Badvel to campaign for the party nominee, P Suresh. BJP leader and former minister, C Adinarayana Reddy, who served as minister in the previous TDP government, is pulling all his energies to keep BJP afloat. “TDP leaders in many villages are coming forward to extend their support to BJP. We will take along everyone who is coming with us,” said Adinarayana Reddy. He said TDP sympathisers would support BJP as they would not prefer to back YSRC and Congress. CM Ramesh, Rajya Sabha member, is also working overtime to rope in TDP leaders to back the BJP candidate. Sources said BJP was finding it difficult to appoint polling agents in many villages in the constituency. In the absence of cadre in all villages, BJP leaders are requesting TDP activists to cooperate with them. BJP leaders are visiting villages and explaining schemes and funds granted by the BJP-led Union government. “The Centre released Rs 7.83 crore to seven villages in Gopavaram mandal during 2017-2021. The state government had spent only around Rs 3.5 crore. The state government is implementing welfare schemes with central funds and putting Jagananna name,” alleged Veerraju. Jana Sena, which decided not to contest the election, has decided to support BJP. Sources said the BJP was finding it difficult to appoint polling agents in many villages in the constituency. In the absence of cadre in all villages, BJP leaders are requesting TDP activists to cooperate with them.

It has increased the fund-raise programme from Rs 3,000 crore after a re-evaluation of its requirement. In August, it had decided to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore through a rights offering. But, on Thursday, it modified its capital-increase programme and now will raise Rs 2,000 crore via a rights issue and another Rs 2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). At Taj’s annual shareholder meet in June this year, its chairman N Chandrasekaran had said that capital infusion in some form in the company is important. It will not only help to navigate the immediate months but also prepare for the future. Taj said on Thursday that the equity issuances are to make the company “zero-debt” in the future and to finance growth plans. It has a debt of Rs 3,571 crore on its books. Taj parent Tata Sons will be subscribing to a substantial chunk of the Rs 2,000-crore rights issue considering it holds 38% in the hospitality chain. In case of under-subscription, the rights issue will be backed by Tata Sons. This will be the fourth rights issue by Taj in the last 13 years. It mopped up Rs 1,500 crore in April 2017, Rs 1,000 crore in January 2016 and over Rs 840 crore in February 2008. Indian Hotels will also be using the resources to buy out existing shareholders, aggregating to 40% stake, from Roots Corporation, operator of budget chain Ginger, for Rs 1,225 crore. Incorporated in 2003, Roots’s existing shareholders are Tata Opportunities Fund (held through Omega TC Holdings and Tata Capital), Piem Hotels (a unit of Indian Hotels) and Tata Investment Corporation (an arm of Tata Sons). The move, said Taj CFO Giridhar Sanjeevi, is to simplify its holding structure and consolidate its interests. After the share-purchase, Roots will become a 100% subsidiary of Indian Hotels. On Thursday, IHCL reported a loss of Rs 131 crore for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-hotels-to-raise-rs-4k-cr/articleshow/87192672.cms||Reeba Zachariah

While 545 corneal transplants were done successfully to eligible recipients, the remaining cornea could not be used as they were found medically unfit for transplant. EBB incharge Dr Nilesh Mohan said the latest retrieval done was a pair of cornea from a 78-year-old who died after battling for his life in the intensive care unit of the IGIMS on Thursday. Within minutes of the retrieval, the EBB officials began calling the persons from the list of registered needy recipients for transplant. “We will try to transplant them at the earliest, not exceeding 15 days,” he said. “The Covid pandemic put a brake on donation and transplant of eyes. However, when the EBB reopened this August, things began gathering momentum and the eye bank became richer by 18 fresh corneal donations till date,” Dr Nilesh said. About 500 persons registered for transplant with the EBB are still awaiting their turn to restore vision in their eyes. Head of RIO, Dr Bibhuti Prasan Sinha, said lack of awareness about eye donation was the main reason for slow pace of corneal transplant in Bihar. Meanwhile, the RIO has decided to develop the specific media required for preservation of the cornea at its own instead of depending on the AIIMS-Delhi for making it available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/545-corneal-transplants-in-7-years-at-igims-eye-bank/articleshow/87191241.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Migrants returning to Bihar from J&K seek employment||PATNA: The rush of migrant workers returning to their home states from Jammu & Kashmir is increasing with each passing day. Migrant workers from Bihar are no exception. Take the case of Kundan Kumar, a migrant worker from Naughachhia in Bhagalpur district. He was in a hurry to catch a train from Jammu for his hometown in Bihar on Wednesday. Kundan somehow managed to board Jammu Tawi-Guwahati Lohit Express at around 10.49am on Wednesday. But he had to shell out Rs 1,500 instead of Rs 900 to an agent for a ticket. “I don’t care how much I have to pay for the ticket,” Kundan said. Kundan left Jammu in a huff due to fear of attack from militants. “I used to run a food joint on a roadside to earn livelihood. I was happy with my earnings there,” he told this newspaper over phone. But things changed in the last two months. “I was scared of going out of my rented accommodation. Finally, I decided to depart for my hometown. I am not sure whether I will go back to Jammu again,” he added. Mantu Kumar, a migrant worker from Banka, was also travelling in the same train. He said several people were still waiting for train at Jammu. “I am fortunate to get a ticket. Many families are in the queue to get tickets,” he added. Mithilesh Kumar, brother of Arvind Kumar Sah (who was killed in terrorist attack), said though he was a bit relaxed after reaching home safely, lack of job opportunities here was a matter of concern. Anand Kumar, brother of Raja Rishidev, who was also killed in terrorist attack in the valley, said the Bihar government should be more serious about dealing with the problem of migration now. Other migrant workers like Nilesh, Sanjay, Shyam and Sanjit, all residents of Mirzapur in Araria district, echoed similar views. “It is high time the government should do something for the migrant workers,” another migrant worker, Rakesh Kumar of Saharsa, said. State labour resources minister Jibesh Kumar said the government has initiated a slew of measures for the rehabilitation of the migrant workers in the state. “The department is already working it. More initiatives will be taken up by the state government in the days to come,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/migrants-returning-to-state-from-jk-seek-employment/articleshow/87191663.cms||Ramashankar

He instructed the collectors of Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Anantapur, Krishna, East Godavari and Kurnool districts to speed up the works. The chief minister held a video conference with district collectors, joint collectors and SPs from his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday and reviewed various development works and the grievance redressal programme. The chief minister also asked collectors to ensure that e-cropping is done at the Rythu Bharosa Kendras and farmers are paid remunerative price during procurement. He wanted collectors to monitor MNREGS works in villages. On the land survey and housing programmes, the chief minister told collectors to ensure that all disputes over land rights are resolved and computerised. He said land registration works would be introduced at the village and ward secretariats shortly and told them to complete the integrated land survey, which is being done in the state after 100 years. The chief minister said the government has proposed to establish 4,314 digital libraries with uninterrupted internet facility. He wanted collectors to provide internet facility to every home on demand across the state. Jagan told collectors to hold agriculture advisory committee meetings at regular intervals. He wanted the committees to meet at the village, mandal and district levels before a comprehensive meeting at the state level. The chief minister said 47.4 lakh people will benefit through Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Hakku scheme and the beneficiaries will get all rights to their property. The scheme will start on December 21. Jagan told district collectors to hold a citizen outreach programme on October 29 and 30 in every village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/accelerate-construction-of-clinics-digital-libraries-jagan/articleshow/87192562.cms||Gopi Dara

In an address on the occasion of police commemoration day, the chief minister said they had gone to the extent of using vulgar words against the chief minister, who is a constitutional head. He questioned if it was correct to use such words against the chief minister. Jagan said these elements are trying to brand the youth of Andhra Pradesh as drug addicts, which is the most serious crime. He said the directorate of revenue intelligence, Andhra Pradesh DGP, and Vijayawada police commissioner have clarified that Andhra Pradesh has no links with the Mundra drug seizure case and yet some vested interests are only conspiring against the state government. He said opposition parties are intentionally creating tensions by spreading lies against the state government. Repeated attempts have been made to malign the image of the government in the drugs case even after the state and central investigation agencies clarified that there is no link to Andhra Pradesh. The chief minister observed that crime has taken new forms in the state with political elements trying to stall welfare programmes of the state government. Unable to digest the fact that they have lost power and upon seeing the popularity of YSRC government, they are using every method to create unrest in society. Referring to the incidences of vandalisation of religious places, Jagan said that they are trying to vitiate the atmosphere in the state by destroying idols and burning chariots in temples. “Their purpose is to provoke those who admire the chief minister and gain political mileage if any sporadic incidents take place in anger,” he said. The chief minister further said these elements are trying to brand the youth of Andhra Pradesh as drug addicts. This is a serious crime, he said. They do not hesitate to malign the image of the state and its people for their political gains, Jagan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/drug-conspiracy-an-attempt-to-mar-govt-image-says-cm/articleshow/87192531.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Speaking at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium on Thursday on the occasion of police commemoration day, the chief minister said that though the weekly off was not given for the last one year on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the system is now being restored as cases have come under control. The chief minister exhorted the police to maintain law and order without any compromise and to give top priority to the protection of women, children and elderly persons. He paid tributes to the 377 police personnel that laid down their lives in the line of duty in the last year across the country, of which 11 were from Andhra Pradesh. The chief minister gave financial assistance to the families of police martyrs, besides releasing a book written on the sacrifices by the police. Claiming that Andhra Pradesh has become a role model in police welfare, the chief minister said the state government cleared the previous government’s pending arrears to the police department, increased honorarium to home guards, recruited 16,000 women police and added that a massive recruitment drive will be held to fill vacancies in the department.

A spokesperson said that for those who are part of the experiment, the fee is Re 1 for transactions between Rs 50 and Rs 100, and Rs 2 for transactions above Rs 100. “This is an experiment on a small base, which is a sliver of our users. Most users are possibly being charged Re 1 and are among active users. Nothing has been decided as yet,” a spokesperson said. Last week, PhonePe reported a 44% drop in losses to Rs 888 crore for FY21, while revenues jumped over 84% year-on-year to Rs 690 crore. PhonePe, like most fintechs, has been providing services free of cost to users even as it incurred operational expenses. This was part of a strategy to acquire market share. The reduced losses reported by the company were an outcome of cutting operational costs. It had almost halved its marketing and promotional spending. PhonePe is currently the leader on the UPI platform, recording 165 crore transactions in September, which was almost 45% of the volume and 47% of the value of total transactions. Google Pay is the second-largest in the UPI space with a 35% market share in volume and 38% in values.IPO-bound Paytm, with a 9% market share, has decided to focus on peer-to-merchant and other transactions. Paytm has already taken steps to improve operating margins by charging customers for topping up their e-wallets using a credit card but does not charge them a platform fee for payments. Several banks have a fixed charge for enabling bill-pay facilities. While most technology companies are burning money in acquiring and retaining customers, those that provide payment support to businesses are making money. PhonePe’s success in being able to pass on some of its costs to users could determine the future course of consumer fintech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/phonepe-tries-recharge-fee-on-some-users/articleshow/87192887.cms||Mayur Shetty

While the noise level at 114 other pandals was measured between 75-85dB, it was in the range of 85-100dB at 118 pandals and more than 100dB at 17. During Durga Puja festivities, 939 sound level samples were collected from 260 pandals in Patna on October 7 and from October 12 to 14. The BSPCB had divided the city into four zones — Patna City to Gai Ghat, Gai Ghat to Gandhi Maidan, Gandhi Maidan to Digha Ghat and Digha Ghat to Danapur. A team was formed to monitor the sound level of the loudspeakers and amplifiers at pandals in all the zones on October 12, 13 and 14 and compare it with the noise level monitored on October 7. The maximum noise level was recorded at 110.6dB on October 14. According to the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000, the ambient noise level in the daytime in commercial areas should be below 65dB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-11-organisers-maintained-noise-level-below-75db-on-october-14/articleshow/87191287.cms||Faryal Rumi

He said the followers of the chief minister will continue to confront the TDP leaders till they make a retreat. Addressing a public meeting in Vijayawada as part of two-day ‘Janagraha Deeksha’ on Thursday, Sajjala alleged that TDP has never been a decent party on the political stage since it was taken over by Chandrababu Naidu. “Naidu has never followed fair politics. In fact, Naidu has never won elections on his own,” said Sajjala. He said they always take pity on Naidu as he “lacked guts to face the political opponents”with policies and schemes. Sajjala alleged that the TDP would try to vitiate the tempers and sentiments of people for selfish goals. “Naidu has employed a few people to wantonly abuse the chief minister with derogatory language. He can’t test our patience time and again. Though all the senior leaders and legislators are exercising restraint following chief minister’s instructions, party cadres are not ready to spare them,” warned Sajjala. He said they would surely approach Election Commission of India (ECI) seeking cancellation of TDP’s recognition. YSRC legislators and leaders organised protest programmes across the state demanding Naidu to tender apology for TDP leader Pattabhi Ram’s remarks against the chief minister. Transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) said Naidu launched another ‘Deeksha’ only to cover up his “conspiracy” behind Pattabhi Ram. Meanwhile, at Nagari in Chittoor, YSRC legislator RK Roja demanded Nara Bhuwaneswari and Brahmani to explain their stand on the comments made by Pattabhi as he levelled serious allegations against chief minister. She said Naidu was shamelessly writing letters to Amit Shah after holding protests against the union home minister before the last elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-must-repent-remarks-against-cm/articleshow/87192627.cms||Samdani MN

The bank’s MD & CEO Rakesh Sharma said the increase in profits was largely due to the drop in cost of funds, which helped improve the bank’s net interest income. However, loan growth was slow at 4.6%. Total advances stood at Rs 1.32 lakh crore at September-end, compared to Rs 1.26 lakh crore a year ago. Deposits were flat at Rs 2.2 lakh crore. Loans in most categories shrunk from March 2021 levels. However, priority sector loans were up by Rs 4,500 crore. Sharma said that the bank was confident of achieving its target of 8% credit growth in the current financial year. “Earlier, when the bank was under the RBI’s prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, we were not able to retain our share of credit in consortiums that we were a part of. Now that we are out of PCA we can lend to corporates and regain our share,” said IDBI Bank deputy MD Samuel Joseph Jebaraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idbi-banks-sept-quarter-net-profit-up-75/articleshow/87192832.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi warns fin advisers against dealing in e-gold||Mumbai: Sebi has warned investment advisers from helping clients invest in digital gold instruments since these are not regulated by it. In early August this year, the stock exchanges had warned brokers not to deal in digital gold. Digital gold products are electronic receipts proving investments in the yellow metal by investors but not actual gold. Instead, the original sellers of such digital gold investment products keep physical gold in vaults. The product is similar to gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) units. But, unlike ETFs launched by fund houses and regulated by Sebi, digital gold receipts are yet to get the regulatory nod. “It has come to the notice of Sebi that some registered investment advisers are engaged in unregulated activity by providing a platform for buying/selling/dealing in unregulated products including digital gold. Undertaking such unregulated activity including dealing (that is advisory, distribution and execution/implementation services) in digital gold by investment advisers is not in accordance with rules,” Sebi said through a press release on Thursday. The markets regulator advised investment advisers to refrain from undertaking such unregulated activities. “Any dealing in unregulated activities by investment advisers may entail action as deemed appropriate” under Sebi rules and regulations. In August, through a release, the NSE had said that some of its members were providing platforms to their clients for buying and selling of digital gold. Earlier, Sebi had informed exchanges that facilitating trading in digital gold was in contravention of securities laws. The exchange asked its members to refrain from undertaking such activities and members who were engaged in such trading were asked to stop the same by September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-warns-fin-advisers-against-dealing-in-e-gold/articleshow/87192809.cms||---

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the national executive committee meeting of HAM(S) in New Delhi, Manjhi said it was a matter of grave concern that the Bihari migrant workers were being targeted by militants in the union territory. Responding to a query, the former CM said the Union government should provide security to Bihari migrant workers living in the valley and also ensure their safe return to their hometowns in the wake of recent killings there. In a veiled attack on the NDA government at the Centre, the HAM(S) chief asked, “Is the killing of four migrant workers from Bihar not enough to wake up the the central government? Is the government waiting for more killings? Is the killing of four people not enough to take steps?” Reacting to the media reports about proposed visit of Shah to J&K, Manjhi said the moot point is whether his visit would solve the problem.  “I have no objection over his visit. But the issue should be resolved,” he added. He said though the central government was dealing with the situation sensitively, the outbreak of the terrorist activities in the valley was increasing.  As a result, people from Bihar were running away just like the Covid-induced lockdown. “The central government needs to take action like Indira Gandhi did during the Bangladesh war,” he said, recalling the valour of the Bihar regiment during the Kargil war.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/provide-security-to-migrants-from-bihar-manjhi-tells-centre/articleshow/87192187.cms||Ramashankar

Three railway employees, including the driver, were injured in the incident. Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh said he has marked an enquiry into the matter. “The condition of the three railway employees, including the driver of the loco is out of danger but they are still under treatment. An enquiry has been marked as the cause of derailment is failure of breaks. This is a serious matter and must be probed judiciously as it could have happened with the loco pulling a train.” The loco, which was heading towards Ambala from Kalka derailed near Chandimandir railway station late on Wednesday evening and fell into a ditch along the tracks. The loco was from Saharanpur yard where it is maintened. Railway officers suspect that the maintenance staff of the Saharanpur loco yard made a mistake, because of which breaks failed and the loco derailed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/brake-failure-caused-train-loco-derailment/articleshow/87192766.cms||---

The committee visited Brahmagiri in the Trimbakeshwar taluka and Sarul in the Nashik taluka after a series of complaints by local villagers about illegal mining and other activities in the forest areas. The joint report prepared by the team of officials — including Nashik West deputy conservator of forests Pankaj Garg, sub-divisional officer of Igtpuri-Trimbakeshwar Tejas Chavan, deputy regional officer of pollution control board Amar Durgule and district mining officer Rohini Chavan — said that during the team's visit, the local residents had complained about blasting at the mining sites being carried out at night. The committee observed that the boards, cautioning about the use of explosives in the mining areas, had been found. The villagers alleged that the explosives were being used at night, which is prohibited. The administration has limited the use of explosives to certain specific times of the day. If the villagers are saying that explosives are being used at night, then such activities could be forcing the animals to flee the areas. The nocturnal animals could, therefore, be turning to human settlements in search of prey, the committee noted. “Animals like leopards and hyenas that fail to get food in the forests, then turn towards the human settlements for prey. This further leads to the man-animal conflict and, therefore, measures need to be taken to ensure that explosives are not used at night,” the committee said. District collector Suraj Mandhare, who is the chairman of the committee, said: “I have asked the committee to ensure environment conservation and at the same time, allow development. We need to strike a balance. The committee has been asked to divide the areas into three categories, namely “excavation banned”, “restricted” and “allowed freely”. We will soon have this report and then take a call,” the collector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/committee-night-blasting-at-mine-sites-may-be-amplifying-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/87191613.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Mokariya, managing director of Nandan Courier, was booked by the cops for helping rape accused Raju Bhatt in escaping from the city. His name had cropped up during the investigations when the police were looking for Bhatt who was arrested later. “We argued in the court that Mokariya wasn’t an accused in the offence of rape or abetment. He has been accused of allegedly helping the key accused escape and it’s a bailable offence. The court granted him bail on Thursday,” said advocate Kaushik Bhatt. The police had earlier said that Mokariya had taken Bhatt to Ranoli highway for ‘settling’ the matter of rape through some other associates. From there, Mokariya allegedly dropped Bhatt in Ahmedabad in his own car. Senior police officials said that Mokariya knew the girl since last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/local-court-grants-bail-to-kanji-mokariya/articleshow/87192041.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The ATM had at least Rs 20 lakh in cash. Police sources said money was loaded in the ATM around 3pm on Wednesday and the theft took place around 1.30am. Police said four criminals with their faces covered could be seen in the CCTV camera footage of the neighbourhood. The criminals could be seen tying the machine with heavy ropes and then uprooting it. At least two special auxiliary police (SAP) jawans armed with rifles were on night duty hardly few metres away from the ATM kiosk. They, however, did nothing to stop the criminals. SHO of Phulwarisharif police station Rafique-Ur-Rahman said there were two ATM kiosks at a distance of 200 metres in the area. “The jawans are deployed there every night as the area is theft and crime prone,” he said. Rahman added the HDFC Bank ATM was managed by a private firm and its regional representative, Raju Kumar Singh, has lodged an FIR in connection with the crime. He said the police were trying to identify the criminals and arrest them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/burglars-flee-with-atm-containing-rs-20-lakh/articleshow/87190961.cms||---

As per information available on the website of the Union ministry of home affairs, the actual police-population ratio at national level is 155.78 police personnel per lakh population as on January 1, 2020. Bihar’s ratio is the poorest in the country – 76.2 police personnel per lakh population. This data was also presented in Rajya Sabha earlier this year by MHA against an unstarred question. Over 2 lakh personnel would be required in state police to achieve the national average. The DGP, who had reached Shaheed Sthal on BSAP-5 campus to pay tributes to the martyred police personnel on the occasion of Police Commemoration Day, told mediapersons, “The sanctioned strength of state police has been increased to 1.42 lakh. It would be further increased in the coming years to increase police-population ratio.” Singhal said the state government has also given its nod to increase the strength of police to achieve the national average. “We have aimed to make more than 12,000 recruitments annually to reach the sanctioned strength of 1.42 lakh first. The existing sanctioned strength will be achieved in the next two to three years. Afterwards, continuous recruitments will be done,” he added. The DGP said 12,955 constables were undergoing training and process was on to recruit 2,277 sub-inspectors and other officers. Other senior IPS officers, including ADGs Jitendra Singh Gangwar, Sushil Mansingh Khopde and Paras Nath also paid their tributes to martyred police officers. The state has lost 35 police personnel in past one year, including seven who were killed in action and 28 who succumbed to Covid while performing duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/12k-cops-to-be-recruited-in-bihar-every-year-says-dgp/articleshow/87191736.cms||Debashish Karmakar

According to sources, the seats sanctioned in language courses and some self-financing programmes are vacant in most institutions.  While more than 700 of the 4,291 seats are vacant in PU colleges, as many as 77,000 of the 1.22 lakh seats in PPU colleges are yet to be filled up.  PU colleges have already started their classes, but PPU colleges are likely to start their classes from November 15. PPU registrar Jitendra Kumar told this reporter that the university’s admission portal would remain open from Thursday to Monday. “Only the candidates, who applied earlier and could not get themselves admitted owing to some discrepancies or non-availability of seats in their desired institutions in the last two rounds of admissions, will be eligible to submit fresh online applications. The third merit list will be released on October 27 and the process of admission will continue till October 30. After that spot admissions will commence in different colleges from November 1,” the registrar added. On the other hand, the principals of PU colleges, at a meeting held here on Thursday, decided to start college-wise on-the-spot counselling and admissions on the remaining vacant seats in different courses from Tuesday. Meanwhile, PU on Thursday invited online applications for admission to all its postgraduate self-financing courses. The last date for submission of applications by eligible candidates is November 20. PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary said admission to all these courses would be made on the basis of marks and appearing candidates may also apply for admission provided they submit their marks before the finalisation of selection. “Applications for admission to the conventional PG courses in arts, science, and commerce streams will also be invited shortly after the publication of Degree Part III examination results. The results of final year graduation honours examinations will be published within a week,” the VC added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/colleges-struggle-to-fill-up-vacant-seats/articleshow/87191305.cms||B K Mishra

---||Business||Critical shortage of chips hits life-saving medtech devices||Rupali.Mukherjee@timesgroup.com Mumbai: The severe shortage of semiconductor chips is now going to hit where it hurts — critical life-saving devices and the medtech industry. The growing uncertainty and supply disruptions of chips globally has already led to an increase in prices of certain devices, with some facing stockouts across the country. But more importantly, the shortages now threaten availability of hundreds of chip-powered critical care and ICU devices including ventilators, defibrillators, imaging machines, glucose, ECG, blood-pressure monitors and implantable pacemakers. By year-end, the impact on stocks could get worse, and overall prices are expected to go up as high as 20%, medtech players told TOI. So far, the spotlight has been on the impact of chips’ shortage on high-profile, consumer-driven sectors like automobiles and electronics. Already, the lead time in manufacturing of chips has jumped from the earlier four-to-eight weeks to 30-40 weeks now and, in certain components, even 100 weeks. This has disrupted delivery schedules of manufacturers, leading to huge delays. A market player said that the delay in supply of even a single microprocessor chip could derail production of the device, affecting timelines and delivery. “At present, we are able to manage the demand and hold the prices of the devices. The uncertainty is, however, growing and an acute shortage may hit us by year-end when existing stocks of microprocessor chips may get depleted,” said Sunil Khurana, CEO & MD of BPL Medical Technologies, which sells anaesthesia machines, patient monitors and ICU ventilators. For instance, the market has already run out of devices like patient monitors, defibrillators and ECGs that use touchscreens. The chips are sourced from domestic vendors who import these from China, Japan, Taiwan and the US. “Though the consumption of medtech devices is low, it will have an impact on hundreds of devices, leading to disruption. The industry has sensitised the Centre several times since 2012 about the need to build our semiconductor fabrication plants to become truly ‘Atma Nirbhar’ in electronics and medtech. In the mid-’90s, we had a robust and vibrant computer hardware sector. Thereafter, it was neglected. We were caught sleeping while China had a clear executable strategy. It’s time to look at this with priority. If we don’t have time to invent, we could blindly copy the China hardware model. It’s late but still possible to be fairly ‘Atma Nirbhar’ in 10 years if there is a separate ministry for self-reliance and a non-political experts’ panel,” said Vishwaprasad Alva, MD of Skanray Technologies, manufacturer of critical care and ICU equipment. Further, it is tough to switch and find alternatives to chips due to several compatibility and design issues, industry experts say. “Capacity utilisation and delivery timelines of medical devices manufacturers are getting impacted — it’s not so serious as yet to cause shutdowns as manufacturers of chips are giving priority access to medical electronics, while some are scurrying to find alternative secondary sources of suppliers,” said Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator at the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry. There is a strong case hence for including medtech on the list of high-priority industries to safeguard those patients who rely on medical technologies for lifesaving care, the expert added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/critical-shortage-of-chips-hits-life-saving-medtech-devices/articleshow/87192811.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Cops had arrested accused Ajay alias Hanuman Nishad Kevat (39) on October 13 and also collected scientific and medical evidence besides recording statements of persons concerned within the shortest possible time. The police ensured that even forensic investigation was completed as fast as possible. Senior police officials including city police police commissioner Ajay Tomar requested top officials of the directorate of forensic science in Gandhinagar to provide early results of Gait analysis and forensic science reports of various samples. “Efficiency of the criminal justice system can be measured by speedy delivery of justice. Police have not only done speedy investigation but also collected scientific evidence in record time,” city police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI. “It was challenging to bring the minor out of trauma but we could do it quickly. Her normal mental condition was most important to record her statement with exact details,” cops said. Accused Kevat, father of three children, had abandoned the minor in the bushes after brutalising her. Cops found the girl shivering in pain and cold, drenched in the heavy rain. “The nature of the crime together with the age of the survivor was a major trigger point for us to ensure that we worked quickly to get justice for her,” said J P Jadeja, inspector, Sachin GIDC police station. “We could complete the Gait analysis and forensic examination within a very short period,” said J K Pandya, assistant commissioner of police, F division.

Almost all employer respondents (94%) of a survey by job site Indeed said they want people coming in to work to be vaccinated with at least a single dose. 87% of employees who took the survey conveyed a similar sentiment saying that they would like co-workers to be vaccinated.  Even as vaccination rates are increasing progressively, some employers are also mandating vaccination, the survey showed. 70% of all employers surveyed would either not allow employees who refuse to get vaccinated to step into the workplace or would ask them to quit the organization. 82% of the workforce surveyed agree vaccination should be made mandatory in the workplace. Employees also seem to trust their employer when it comes to vaccine transparency and believe that their companies may not allow employees who aren’t vaccinated to enter the workplace, the study noted. While 87% of all employee respondents believe entry to the workplace should be for people who are vaccinated at least once, 43% believe that people coming into the workplace need not carry vaccination certificates and 41% think they need not know the vaccination status of other employees. Companies across sectors seem divided when it comes to decisions to offer incentives to employees for their vaccination. Only a little more than half of the employers across sectors such automobile (51%), IT and knowledge (52%) and media and entertainment sectors support incentives for vaccinations. “Vaccination has emerged as a top hiring trend. Some businesses are either making it mandatory or heavily encouraging vaccination among their new hires,” Sashi Kumar, head of sales, Indeed said Large service sector employers including the IT service companies have completed vaccination for almost 90% staff and have had senior leadership teams coming into offices to inspire confidence and as a precursor to begin normal operations at office space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-want-staff-to-be-vaccinated/articleshow/87193611.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Rai was rushed to the primary health centre (PHC) at Taraiya from where he was referred to the Chhapra sadar hospital. His condition is stated to be critical. The victim’s sister, Putul Devi, told police that two youths riding a motorbike pumped two bullets when Rai was returning home after campaigning. He is in the fray from Madhopur panchayat in Saran district. Saran SP Santosh Kumar directed the investigating officer to arrest the culprits at the earliest. “The accused will be put behind the bar soon,” he told reporters at Chhapra after the incident. The election in Madhopur panchayat under Taraiya block in the district is scheduled to be held on October 24. The incident has sparked tension between two rival groups. Incidentally, this is not an isolated case of attack on the aspirants of different posts under panchayati raj institutions in the state. The panchayat election is being held in eleven phases. On Wednesday, a close relative of a sitting mukhiya was killed under Musahari police station area in Muzaffarpur district. His body was recovered from a place close to a polling booth. The deceased's sister-in-law, Jayanti Devi is the sitting mukhiya of Rajwara Bhagwan panchayat. Her husband Shivnath Prasad Yadav described the incident as a fallout of political rivalry. On Sunday, Kanhaiya Sharma, a close relative of the sitting mukhiya of Khajuri panchayat, Ruby Sharma, received stab wound in an attack on him near Pakri village in Saran district late on Sunday. The incidents of attack either on the candidates or their relatives during the panchayat election have gone up in the state. One Ravindra Kumar Singh, cousin of the sitting mukhiya of Raspur Patasia panchayat, Prince Singh, survived a murderous attack at Sultanpur village under Mohiuddin Nagar police station areas in Samastipur district last week. The frequent attacks either on the contestants or their relatives have set the alarm bells ringing at the state police headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mukhiya-candidate-shot-at-in-saran/articleshow/87191681.cms||Ramashankar

The organisation has appointed Shamsuddin Jasani as the incoming CEO, South Asia, effective November 1. Both Rai and Jasani will report directly to Ewen Sturgeon, CEO, international, of Wunderman Thompson. Shamsuddin, or ‘Shams’, is a veteran of the industry, having launched Isobar in India in 2008, growing it from a two-person team to over 300-strong across South Asia. In a statement, Sturgeon described Jasani as the “natural successor to continue propelling our South Asia business forward”. Jasani said, “It’s a great honour, but an even greater responsibility, to join such an iconic brand as Wunderman Thompson, with an amazing legacy. I am really excited to not only continue this legacy but to take it to greater heights with the combination of creative, data, commerce and technology. I believe at Wunderman Thompson we have all the ingredients to be the partner of choice for the growth and transformation of brands and business in India.” During the seven years as chairman & CEO, Rai steered the agency through significant changes at an organisational and cultural level — most recently leading the successful and seamless transition to Wunderman Thompson. Previously with JWT, he returned to the agency in 2015 after a long stint in media, and put the company back on the growth path. During this time, Rai also diversified the organisation’s capabilities, built a leadership team and fostered a culture of collaboration across the various group companies. Rai said, “The last seven years have been very exciting and rewarding. The unprecedented changes in these years required nimble leadership. I also had the opportunity to lead the transition to our new company, Wunderman Thompson, which has a powerful mix of creativity and technology. I am extremely proud of our people and of our leadership team for their fantastic work through these years. We partner with some of the best clients in the industry and I value their friendship and support.

Sources in the know said the move follows the fintech unicorn’s plans to foray into the wallet payments business with the prepaid payment instrument license held by HipBar. The financial contours of the transaction is not known but it is learnt that it is a 100% buyout of HipBar and will see Kunal Shah joining as a director in the company. While the specifics of the integration were not immediately clear, the entire tech stack will be acquired and the team of HipBar including founder Prasanna Natrajan are set to join Cred and no layoffs are planned, a source said. “Cred has no intention to get into the liquor delivery business,” the person added. The deal follows HipBar’s decision to exit the liquor delivery business burdened with regulatory hurdles in such a model across states. Cred’s interest in the startup comes from its plans to add a layer of payment wallets to its platform using HipBar’s PPI, which will allow them to offer cashbacks to consumers. A PPI license, granted by the RBI, allows companies to operate payments systems such as digital wallets, pre-paid vouchers, etc. HipBar and Cred declined to comment on ToI’s queries on acquisition. Global spirit major Diageo, which acquired a 26% stake in HipBar in 2018, exited the startup earlier in July this year, selling its entire ownership to HipBar promoter Natarajan. HipBar had a turnover of over Rs 50 lakh in fiscal year 2020. As an early mover in the liquor delivery space, HipBar’s journey has been marred with litigation over the years. While it was operating in West Bengal and Odisha markets, it had to stop services in Karnataka due to pushback from local retailers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cred-acquires-liquor-delivery-app-hipbar/articleshow/87193580.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Police stated in their remand report that the arrest of Pattabhiram was necessitated as he was a habitual offender and facing four similar cases. The police further justified the arrest of Pattabhiram by stating that his comments led to violent reactions across the state. The material collected so far disclosed participation of a number of people with a motive of bringing disrepute to the government officers of the state, more particularly the police. A very calculated and well thought out conspiracy with the motive to create caste rivalry mixed with abuses against the chief minister to create disharmony and public disorder is required to be investigated, said the cops in their remand report. The police also opposed giving bail to Pattabhiram on grounds he may perpetuate criminal acts again to derive political mileage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-leader-in-judicial-remand-for-14-days/articleshow/87192612.cms||---

AIIMS-Patna Covid in-charge Dr Sanjeev Kumar said the three phases of clinical trials of the new drug, called ‘Molnupiravir’, have been successfully completed with cent percent efficacy. Developed by Germany’s Rigibel and America’s Merck, it can be launched in four to five months. The drug can be taken orally and the patient would recover from illness in a few days, he said. Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC)’s joint director Dr A K Ashu said the pandemic has almost been controlled with vaccination and gradual herd immunity developed in the society. The Covid-19 would get fully controlled with the commissioning of the new drugs, he said. Dr Ashu said ‘Molnupiravir’, once approved by the competent authorities like FDA, shall be affordable for the common men as it would reduce the need for hospitalisation. Cocktails of monoclonal antibodies are also effective but they are very costly and not easy to administer, he added. Former IMA (Bihar branch) president, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, said successful clinical trials of the oral drugs would tame the disease completely. The days are not far away when Covid-19 would be treated just like cold and flu, he said. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said it is too premature to comment on the efficacy of the new drug. The Covid protocol has been changing every now and then and only time will tell how effective the oral drugs are. In the meantime, people should follow the Covid guidelines strictly and get themselves vaccinated at the earliest, he added. Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said it may be the fourth classic drug after Valium, Aspirin and Penicillin. He, however, advised the people to maintain self-restraint while moving out of their homes. “More than 50% eligible global population is not yet inoculated.

The government said that it was keeping a close watch on the dengue situation. The government said in a statement that 221 dengue patients were admitted in Delhi’s hospitals, out of which 42 were from other states.

The government said that Covid positivity rate was 0.2% till June 17 but had come down to 0.06% by October 17. “Due to decrease in Covid infection and increase in the number of the vector-borne diseases, the number of beds reserved for Covid patients in Delhi’s private hospitals has been reduced from 30% to 10%, apart from government hospitals like LNJP, where Covid beds have been reduced from 700 to 400,” it added. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain stated that the dengue situation in Delhi was completely under control and adequate numbers of hospital beds were available. Patients from outside Delhi comprise 25% of the total number of patients admitted in the city’s hospitals, he said.

Acting on a complaint from T Basha, 55, of Varaganeri bazaar, cybercrime police inspector R Sindhunathi investigated the case and arrested C Prabhakaran of Kannakurichi in Salem, on charges of cheating and attempting to steal money, under IPC and Information Technology Act. Police said Basha had petitioned Trichy collector S Sivarasu on August16 seeking help for the livelihood of his daughter Benazir Fatima whose husband hailing from Nagappattinam died by suicide. On October 12, Prabhakaran visited the residence of Basha posing as a revenue inspector from the collector’s office.  Introducing himself as Deva Prasad, he told Basha that he had come to conduct verification for financial assistance of Rs 5.5 lakh and a job in the education department for his daughter on compassionate grounds. He also gave false information that they have to pay a tax of Rs 30,000 to get the assistance for which he also gave a bank account number to deposit the money. Thereafter, he appeared to check Benazir’s mobile phone saying he had to submit the location of the spot where her husband ended his life to the revenue department as proof. A couple of days later, the man called up Basha and insisted that he pay the Rs 30,000 ‘tax’. As he developed suspicion, Basha contacted a revenue official in the collector office and confirmed that there was no such officer by the name Deva Prasad. There was also no procedure to pay tax to get financial assistance. So he lodged a complaint with the police. Inspector Sindhunathi said that the accused got information about the petition submitted by Basha from a newspaper and conspired to cheat the man. He has been remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-held-for-bid-to-cheat-widow-citing-fake-govt-aid/articleshow/87193768.cms||---

These shortcomings have been brought to light in the audit done by the comptroller and auditor general (CAG), he said. Quoting the CAG report, he told reporters in Thanjavur on Thursday that the scandal happened during 2013-2014.  “Expired drugs to the tune of Rs 26.17 lakh had been used to treat patients particularly during the year 2013-2014 period. If people who have used these drugs are found to have been diagnosed with any side-effects or health problems, action will still be taken against the culprits,” Selvaperunthagai added. He was speaking during the committee’s inspection of various ongoing developments works in the district. He said the committee observed that orphaned children and those involved in criminal activities were lodged on the same premises at a government observation home, which was not proper. “According to norms, minors in observation homes should not be locked up between 6am and 6pm. But the home authorities allowed them outside only for an hour a day. We have instructed them to allow them to move freely within the premises during the day,” he added. He said most of the government buildings constructed during the AIADMK regime were not up to the mark. Those who utilized government money to set up buildings have not ensured quality. Some of the school buildings were in poor condition. The committee members inspected 14 spots in Thanjavur including old and new bus stands, hospitals and government observation homes including sites where government buildings were being constructed. The other committee members were M Sinthanai Selvan (Kattumannarkoil), E Raja (Sankarankoil), K Poondi Kalaivanan (Tiruvarur), K Marimuthu (Thiruthuraipoondi), T Velmurugan (Panruti) and MH Jawahirullah (Papanasam).  Government chief whip Kovi Chezhian, assembly secretary K Srinivasan and district collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver also accompanied the committee. The committee later conducted a review meeting at the collector office, where they discussed the steps to be taken to set right the shortcomings found during the visit, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/expired-drugs-used-in-2-ghs-7-yrs-ago-pac/articleshow/87193784.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Now, ETT-TET pass teachers climb atop water tank in Kharar||Mohali: A group of teachers climbed atop a water tank in Kharar on Thursday to press their demands. This is the second group of teachers to do so. Earlier, members of 646 unemployed Physical Training Instructors (PTI) Teachers Union staged a fast-unto-death atop a water tank near Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara. This time, Elementary Teacher Training-Teacher Eligibility Test (ETT-TET) Qualified Unemployed Teachers Union members climbed atop the tank in Kharar. Aman Rana and Dharampal Nukerian climbed the water tank near Desu Majra early on Thursday and threatened to jump if Punjab government did not fulfill their demands. Representatives of the teachers’ union, who were wearing black ribbons, said their two colleagues protesting on top of the tank were facing many challenges. “They have pledged to sit on fast-unto-death atop the water tank and may also jump to death if their demands are not met,” they warned. Union president Deepak Kamboj said, “We had raised our demands in 2016, when Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and MP Preneet Kaur assured that our demands would be fulfilled. Four years after the Congress came to power in the state, the ruling dispensation is still ignoring us.” The teachers demanded publication of one lakh ETT teachers recruitment notification, consideration only for only EET-TET pass teachers, relaxation in age limit, abolition of points for higher qualification and withdrawal of extra weightage given to education providers and volunteers. In June, union members gheraoed the entry and exit of then chief minister’s farm house in Siswan. Around 100 teachers sneaked towards the CM’s residence in Siswan and gathered outside, taking the former cheif minister’s security cordon by surprise for the second time. Earlier, four men buried a body next to the boundary wall of the CM’s residence. After this, 646 unemployed physical training instructors (PTI) Teachers Union used a wooden ladder to climb atop the water tank. In 2019, the concrete staircase of the tank was demolished by the Mohali administration to prevent people from climbing it. Four protesting teachers climbed the tank and sat on hunger strike at a height of around 26 feet, said union president Gurlabh Singh alias Bhola. One of them climbed down but a woman teacher is sitting on fast-unto-death and has refused to come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-ett-tet-pass-teachers-climb-atop-water-tank-in-kharar/articleshow/87192793.cms||---

Tension ran high at the fish market after MMC junior engineer along with police arrived at the market to inform the fruit vendors to shift to the new temporary shed from Thursday. The vendors challenged the civic body staff saying that they would rather “die in the old market than shift elsewhere”. MMC plans to construct a new market for which they want vendors to shift to a shed built for the purpose. MMC has built a temporary shed behind the vegetable market for fruit and fish vendors. The vendors were informed that the old structure will be demolished and a new complex will be built with all facilities. The traditional fishing group at the market had previously agreed to MMC’s plans for shifting but has asked officials to stop all street vendors and wholesalers from selling fish. Leader of the fish vendors Caridade Pereira said, “We were born and grown here. We have not taken a single rupee from anyone to build this structure. We will not go anywhere. Time and again the municipality has failed to stop illegal selling of fish and we don’t have faith in them.” On Thursday only the fruit vendors had been asked to move to the new shed by Friday. Civic officials and stakeholders will meet the fisherfolk on Friday afternoon to discuss their issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-vendors-create-uproar-over-market-shifting-plans/articleshow/87193810.cms||---
---||Delhi||Multilingual, interactive mapping site to guide tourists on culture walk||New Delhi: A first-of-its-kind multilingual and interactive mapping site containing information about museums, heritage of various cities, cultural hotspots and walk trails is now available for cultural enthusiasts. Sahapedia, an open encyclopaedic resource on arts, culture and history of India is holding a seven-week festival (#CultureForAll) to mark the culmination of the project. With over 2,500 points across seven cities already mapped, four more cities were in the pipeline, the curators said. Speaking to TOI, J Padmapriya, head of the cultural mapping project at Sahapedia, said, “We want to make information easily accessible and downloadable. When people travel to different places, they often want things to be mapped properly. Through this site, various cultural themes, places and art forms have been mapped.” While around 25 walk trails with experts are available, those interested can even upload their own trails and share with family and friends. All they need to do is create a profile and upload their walk trails. Apart from tourists, citizens and cultural enthusiasts, the site would also be a valuable source of information for policymakers, explained Padmapriya. “Cultural mapping has been ignored for long, and we cannot arrive at policies unless we know who we are. We have created a database of artists and places that might otherwise not warrant attention. We want things to be in a continuum. Who are the artists today that need to be preserved? These are important questions for policymakers,” Padmapriya said. To cater to a large number of people, the mapping site has been made multilingual. “It is extremely language friendly. For example, the Pune mapping has information in Marathi. We want it to be accessible to all kinds of users. We also intend to have a directory for food sites, information on trees and other such data. We already have a deep archive that we will incorporate in it. We are also working on industrial heritage,” added Padmapriya. The digital festival would continue till November 30 and see performances by various artists, workshops and walk trails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/multilingual-interactive-mapping-site-to-guide-tourists-on-culture-walk/articleshow/87193800.cms||---

The three-day water cut would be the longest in the past couple of years in the city. The Shingnapur barrage, located along the Panchaganga river, has multiple damages and the water level cannot be maintained for pumping at full capacity. Due to inadequate pumping, several places in the city get no water on some days or the water supply is at low pressure. With Diwali approaching, demand for water has increased. The KMC does not want to invite the anger of citizens by not supplying water or supply at low pressure during the festival. Ajay Salokhe, the KMC hydraulic engineer, said, “The repair works are critical for ensuring smooth water supply. The work is difficult as the barrages have leakages below the water level. We have the technical expertise to carry out the task. We are planning to complete the work in two days to ensure the water supply is resumed on the third day — at least at low pressure.” “We have 8-10 water tankers available. If needed, we will get private water tankers. Supply to the affected areas will be made using these tankers. People will receive water supply for additional hours so that they can fill up their storage tanks or containers in advance. Also, citizens are requested to not waste water,” said Salokhe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-3-day-water-cut-from-sunday/articleshow/87190825.cms||---

Aurangabad range special inspector general of police Mallikarjun Prasanna confirmed the development and said that the victims have identified the accused. “Preliminary probe has revealed that the accused has criminal precedents and was released from prison about three months ago,” said Prasanna. Based on the preliminary questioning of the accused, teams from the local crime branch and the Bidkin police station have been sent to different places to nab Pawar’s accomplices. A gang of seven to 10 dacoits had assaulted and robbed a family of farmworkers before allegedly raping two women of the family at Bidkin, near Paithan, around midnight on Tuesday. The gang had targeted at least two more houses nearby thereafter. As per the complaint lodged by the victims, the dacoits barged into the house, assaulted three men in the family, and robbed them of cash and valuables worth Rs 20,000 and three cellphones. They tied up the family members, while four of them raped the two women. The dacoits then targeted an elderly couple in a nearby farm and robbed them. They also stole a two-wheeler from another hamlet. Bidkin police station’s assistant inspector Santosh Mane said there is a possibility of this gang’s involvement in other similar offenses. Police sources said this is the fourth recent dacoity in rural Aurangabad. In one of the earlier incidents too a woman was allegedly raped.

The state BJP leadership did not get any confirmation on Union home minister Amit Shah or party national president JP Nadda’s visit to Huzurabad till now even as the campaigning entered the crucial last phase. Sources said the party top brass had not given any hints so far to the state leaders about the visits of national leaders to Huzurabad. “We may have one or two former Union ministers and ex-MPs addressing the rallies in the last leg of campaigning. We are also constantly trying to reach out to top national leaders,” party sources said. During the last year’s Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls, Nadda, Shah and other national leaders campaigned vigorously, which paid rich dividends resulting in the BJP winning 48 divisions. “We don’t come across instances of national-level leaders campaigning for the party candidate in any by-election,” a senior BJP leader told TOI. Party former general secretary P Muralidhar Rao was the only national-level face so far to have campaigned in the Huzurabad assembly constituency. Apart from him, the party is leaning on Union tourism and culture minister G Kishan Reddy and state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar to drum up support for Eatala. The party had also planned to conduct a public meeting in Huzurabad but decided to wait until TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao’s campaign plan is revealed. While several national leaders addressed rallies during the first phase of Bandi Sanjay’s padayatra, state-level leaders stepped up the campaign in Huzurabad in the last 3-4 days. Sanjay has been touring the constituency in the last 48 hours in support of Eatala. The state BJP is also concerned over the Election Commission’s decision to halt Dalit Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad which, it felt, could prove to be counter-productive to its campaign plans. Party leaders said the TRS was unnecessarily dragging BJP’s name into this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-word-on-shah-nadda-campaign-t-bjp-in-a-fix/articleshow/87193808.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Chandigarh||MC to secure markets with high definition CCTV cameras||MOHALI: Markets in Mohali will have high definition CCTV cameras soon. The MC will install 100 CCTV cameras at congested markets under the Central government funded Nirbhaya Scheme, said mayor Amarjit Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu. He added that the MC would install the cameras in places frequented by women for their protection. “Under the Nirbhaya scheme, the Central Government is providing some funds to municipal corporations for this purpose. The Municipal Corporation has gone into high action mode for protection of women and will spend about Rs 4.5 crore for the purpose by investing funds in addition to those of the Central government,” he said. The mayor (check shirt) inaugurates traffic lightsThe mayor expressed concern against incidents of crimes against women despite the steps taken by the government. He said even though women were working on an equal footing with men in every field, incidents of harassment and abuse continued to occur. In view of this, he said, Government of India had set up a Nirbhaya fund, through which it was proposed to upgrade surveillance infrastructure in cities for women’s protection. To this end, he said, the state government had formulated Punjab Urban Local Bodies Surveillance Grid for Women Safety, PUNGRID-WS scheme under which CCTV cameras would be installed in places like girls' colleges, universities, educational institutions and markets. The mayor said that the police department had identified places where rate of crime against women was likely to increase. A detailed project report had been prepared in this regard, under which 100 cameras would be installed in Mohali city. In the first phase, cameras would be installed in Phase 7, Phase 3B2 market and Phase 5 near the ITI for girls. There will be 80 fixed and 20 moving cameras installed at a total cost of Rs 4.50 crore. BOX: High intensity LED traffic lightsMayor Amarjit Singh inaugurated high intensity LED traffic signal lights system on the traffic lights adjacent to the IISER Institute on Airport Road on Thursday. Mayor Jeeti Sidhu said these lights are “High intensity LED traffic lights” and have been installed here as a pilot project. He said the existing traffic lights, which were round had been replaced by directional lights, which would be visible from a long distance and would help prevent road accidents during the fog in winter. He added that all traffic lights on the main roads of Mohali would be replaced in a phased manner in future. Also, he said, these high intensity directional lights would be installed on internal traffic lights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-secure-markets-with-high-definition-cctv-cameras/articleshow/87192837.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Newly-elected PCI vice president Pramod Yeole said they were mulling an exit examination after the BPharm course, and a restructuring of the DPharm course. “The exit examination is essential to assess the knowledge of students completing BPharm studies. This can gauge knowledge of graduating students who are going to serve the pharma industry,” he said. Yeole said PCI was keen on restructuring the DPharm course at the earliest. “India is the only country where even those who have completed DPharm are considered authorised pharmacists. A section of experts is of the view that the course needs to be scrapped altogether. At PCI, we feel that the course has a huge scope for value addition,” Yeole said. Principal of Government Pharmacy College, V K Mourya, said both the proposed reforms were the need of the hour. “Even if the syllabus is the same for the pharmacy course, the evaluation pattern varies from the one university to another. This calls for a centralised exit examination. Such a measure would, in turn, serve as a benchmark of institutes,” he said. DPharm course was designed by keeping in mind the old employment opportunities. “The medical needs of the society have changed, and the skill set of pharmacy students must also change,” he said. Pharmacy education in India entails a two-year diploma course and a four-year degree course along a two-year postgraduate course .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pci-mulls-exit-examafter-bpharm-course/articleshow/87193814.cms||Prasad Joshi

The victim, a native of Uttar Pradesh, had been living in the rented accommodation since June. The incident came to light when her 12-year-old son came home from school. “When his mother did not respond to his repeated calls, the child went to the first floor and found her lying on the bed in a pool of blood. He raised the alarm and neighbours gathered at the spot,” said a cop. On receiving the information, Shruti Arora, ASP south division, Sector 31 police and a crime branch team reached there. A CFSL team and a dog squad collected fingerprints and other evidence. Police said it was strange that nobody in her neighborhood heard anything as the woman was brutally murdered in daytime. Her husband works in Mohali and had left for work around 6.30am. She was alone at home at the time.  “She was stabbed multiple times in the abdomen. As her clothes were torn, it is being investigated if she was sexually assaulted before the murder. The post-mortem report will make things clear,” the cop added. Her son told the police that his mother had a brawl with a man a few days back. Her husband said he knew nothing about it and did not suspect anybody, the police said. A cop said, “We have vital clues. The case will be solved soon.” Vegetable vendor arrested The victim’s husband said, “Jatinder Singh of Hallomajra murdered my wife. He would often come to our house to meet my wife in my absence. As my wife stopped talking to him and started avoiding him, he killed her. Neighbours also said that Jatinder, a vegetable vendor, was seen near our house in the morning.” Police registered a murder case against Jatinder and arrested him later in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/woman-found-brutally-murdered-in-hallomajra/articleshow/87192860.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||Chandigarh||Rape survivor, mother held for tampering with age proof||Chandigarh: The police have arrested a rape survivor and her mother on charges of submitting a fake age proof, showing her as a minor.They were arrested on Wednesday and a local court remanded them in judicial custody on Thursday. In July this year, the girl’s mother had filed a complaint against a Panchkula man, with whom her daughter worked in a factory, alleging he had raped her several times in a secluded forest area. The girl had got pregnant and the foetus was aborted at 21 weeks after court’s approval. Following the complaint, the Chandigarh police had registered a case against the accused under various sections of the IPC and the POCSO Act and on July 31 he was arrested.According to police officers probing the case, at the time of the registration of the case, the mother of the girl had submitted a photocopy of a school transfer certificate in which her birth year was 2006, making her a 15-year-old.However, police officers claimed that during the scrutiny of the documents they had accessed from the girl’s school, they found her birth year to be 2001, making her 20 years old at the time of the alleged rape.An investigating officer claimed that after thoroughly verifying the school transfer certificate, the police concluded that the mother and daughter had tampered with the age proof to secure benefits under government schemes provided to minor survivors of sexual assaults. “It seems the motive was to get a compensation of Rs 10 lakh from Nirbhaya fund, which is usually given in cases involving minors,” said a police officer. Following the investigation, the police in August removed POCSO Act and some other sections of the IPC from the FIR and booked the accused man under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC. Then after taking legal opinion, the police, on August 17, registered a case under IPC sections 177 (furnishing false information), 195 (giving or fabricating false evidence), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) against the rape survivor and her mother. “We had sought legal opinion and after completing the investigation and verifying the facts, we arrested both the mother and the daughter,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rape-survivor-mother-held-for-tampering-with-age-proof/articleshow/87192844.cms||Pawan Tiwari

---||Aurangabad||BJP leader Chitra Wagh rues case pendancy||Aurangabad: State BJP vice-president Chitra Wagh on Thursday said that over 1.6 lakh cases are pending in the fast track courts (FTCs) across Maharashtra. “After every crime against women, the ruling MVA government says that the matter will be taken up in the fast track courts for delivery of quick justice. However, such a statement is an eyewash as these courts already have over 1.6 lakh pending cases,” she said. Wagh, who was in the city to pay a visit to two gang rape victims in the Paithan taluka, said that during the MVA government’s tenure, the conviction rate in crime against women is only 13.2%, which is very low. “We demand the enactment of a special law for the safety of women along the line of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The desired law should not have a provision of anticipatory bail. Also, there is a need for special courts for women. Despite strong demand from the women, the ruling MVA government is not taking the desired steps,” Wagh told reporters. Wagh further said that crimes against women cannot be a subject of politics. “The MVA leaders accuse us of playing politics when we raise our voice for justice to victims. If standing in support of the victims is politics, we will take pride in it time and again,” she said. Referring to the Paithan gang rape incident, Wagh, who is also a member of the BJP national executive committee, said the chances of victims getting justice are low. “As per the police, the accused dacoits are still absconding and few suspects have been rounded up. We have no hope for justice in this case as the former home minister of Maharashtra is still absconding,” she said in an attack on NCP leader Anil Deshmukh, who is on the radar of the central investigating agencies. It may be noted here that later in the day, the key suspect in the case was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bjp-leader-chitra-wagh-rues-case-pendancy/articleshow/87193828.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Sabarmati river: Gujarat HC calls for strict measures||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court was alarmed when it was informed that sewage is treated in trade effluent treatment plants and industrial waste is treated in city’s sewage treatment plants, and the court commented that this is a very sorry state of affairs and called for suggestions to rectify the situation. This happened during the hearing of the suo motu PIL in connection with maltreatment of sewage water in Pirana STP and discharge of improperly treated water in the Sabarmati river thereby causing pollution in it. The amicus curie Hemang Shah submitted his inspection report and suggestions and environment activist Rohit Prajapati also submitted his findings on behalf of the joint task force (JTF) set up by the high court to arrest river pollution. Prajapati submitted that the effluent treatment plants, which are meant to treat industrial waste, get sewage water for treatment and similarly trade effluents flow into STPs.  This situation results in malfunctioning of both types of treatment plants and as a result only 10-20% water gets treated before direct discharge into the river. He also submitted that it can be said that polluted water gets straightway discharged into the river. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati repeatedly questioned the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) on how many illegal connections have been identified and action taken against the culprits. “What is coming in your way? Are you afraid of somebody? Is some force working against you that you are so diffident in taking positive action? If you feel that your strict action will raise a cry, let the cry be raised. You owe it to the society, to people, to your statutory obligation,” the court told the civic authorities. The judges went on to say, “Today, the day is not far that we will have to take very harsh steps. You may not like it. We are giving an opportunity to rectify it, to stop this nonsense. Why don’t you act positively?” Prajapati submitted that the treatment plants are not functioning properly and there is no monitoring system. He suggested that while the civic body can outsource functioning of treatment plants, it must not outsource the monitoring part.  He and advocate Shah complained about poor skill levels of the engineers engaged in monitoring and operating the plants. It was also submitted that there is no system to monitor outflow of treated water and the readings recorded about the quality of water are questionable because they are not accurate and repetitive. The amicus complained about improper functioning of the laboratories attached to the treatment plants. The court said that it would order suspension of in-charge officers of the laboratories. Prajapati insisted that there should be a plan for 30-40 years in dealing with such issue and reiterated that the damage to the river has been done. To this, the high court said, “You don’t lose heart. We will try our best to convince all.”The court has posted further hearing on this issue in December and said that it would pass an interim order. Hold everybody accountable to stop river pollution During the hearing, the amicus curie Hemang Shah and JTF member Rohit Prajapati insisted on presence of the chief secretary and Ahmedabad’s municipal commissioner in court because they are bestowed with certain responsibilities of enforcement to curb pollution. To this, the judges said, “We request the municipal commissioner, if he is watching this proceeding on livestreaming, to hold every person accountable for this. Accountability is something which will make headway in this. We don’t expect Sabarmati water as clean as mineral water, but at least we can stop this damage. You have to come up heavily on each and every person. Hold them accountable. Create that deterrence. Identify illegal connections and take steps. They will fear before putting a hole in the pipeline. We are not doing this for anyone but for good of the people.” HC pulls up AMC: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation expressed its limitation to respond to the reports submitted by the amicus curiae and JTF and submitted that its teams were busy because a World Bank’s team was in the city to discuss funding for up-gradation of STPs. The judges laughed, and asked to stop livestreaming, and took the authorities to the task for making deals worth crores of rupees with the World Bank for STP up-gradation, but do not bother to look after malfunctioning treatment plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sabarmati-hc-calls-for-strict-measures/articleshow/87193001.cms||---

---||Kolkata||School hosts webinar on environmental eco||Kolkata: The pre-Covid era witnessed environmental disasters due to lack of awareness on waste management or sometimes due to mankind’s reluctant nature. The pandemic era added to this by generating wastes in form of masks, PPE kits and other related wastes throughout the world. If not managed today all these wastes may bring our life to a critical junction in the near future. Keeping this in mind, Tribeni Tissues Vidyapith recently hosted a webinar on ‘Environmental Economics’ as a reflection of its concern for a better environment. The webinar titled “Manage the Pandemic Waste Today, Avoid the Environmental Disaster Tomorrow” was the brainchild of principal Sanghamitra Chatterjee and is the first ever initiative by any school in West Bengal. It was moulded into shape through the initiatives, ideas and encouragement provided by her. Nine schools of Kolkata and Hooghly district became a part of a powerpoint presentation competition on the topic. Innovative research papers were given by all the participating schools, including Aditya Academy Secondary Barasat, Aditya Academy Senior Secondary Dum Dum, Auxillium Convent Bandel, Don Bosco Bandel, St Joseph’s Convent Chandannagore, Holy Child Kalna, Dunlop English Medium School, Birla Gyan Mandir and TTV. The panelists were Sanchayan Bannerjee, The Chair (associate fellow of the Higher Education Academy London School of Economics & Political Science, UK), Soumyendra Nath Ghosh (senior research officer, West Bengal Biodiversity Board) and Siddhartha Mitra (Prof, Economics dept, Jadavpur University). They were present in the two-hour webinar and were the judges for the session. The award-winning presentation by Tribeni Tissues Vidyapith was appreciated as the students could get the desired result out of the technique of waste management proposed by them. From the disposed cotton and surgical masks, the students were efficiently able to recreate rayon fibre without any harmful byproducts getting generated. In second and the third place were Aditya Academy Dum Dum and St Joseph’s Convent, Chandannagore, respectively who successfully presented ideas to recycle PPE kits. The session was followed by a panel discussion which elaborated on the disposal of pandemic waste management. The entire event reflected the well-coordinated teamwork of the faculty and was live streamed on the school’s YouTube channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/school-hosts-webinar-on-environmental-eco/articleshow/87192920.cms||---

Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for ED, opposing his application, cited a Supreme Court ruling to argue that he must go before a trial court with a regular bail plea, as a chargesheet was filed. Justice Nitin Sambre, who heard submissions by senior counsel Shirish Gupte for Khadse, directed him to approach the special trial court for relief, and directed the subordinate court to hear and decide his application. A special court had last month initiated a process against Khadse and four others, including his wife and son-in-law, observing that a prima facie case had been made out against them following the ED chargesheet. His wife Mandakini appeared before a special court on Thursday and his lawyers made an exemption plea, which was allowed after the trial court was told HC had given him time to appear. The special court said it was granting exemption only for the day, and in its order said he had to appear on October 29. Gupte opposed Singh’s contention and said there was no bar on maintainability of the pre-arrest bail plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-directs-ed-not-to-arrest-eknath-khadse-for-a-week/articleshow/87194765.cms||Swati Deshpande

Upon insistence of MP Dhairyasheel Mane, district collector Rahul Rekhawar had called for a meeting of the managing directors of all sugar mills across Kolhapur. Rekhawar said it is the moral obligation of the mill owners to prefer cutting and crushing of sugar canes affected by floods. Over 60,000 hectare of sugar cane farm has been partially damaged due to floods. Mane speaking to TOI said, “The millers accepted our request and have agreed to crush the flood affected sugar cane first. The millers have been asked to submit the schedule stating when they will cut and crush the sugar cane from each village they cater to.” Mane said the millers raised some genuine concerns like workers not being able to access the fields owing to damages to the roads in flooded areas. “The machineries and vehicles will not reach the fields. The partially damaged sugar cane yields less recovery of sugar and therefore the millers said they will crush 20% sugar cane from flood-affected areas and 80% from non-flooded areas. We want the millers to crush at least 40% canes from flood-affected areas as the farmers need money urgently for sustaining themselves. A decision in this regard is expected to be finalised by next week,” Mane said. Most of the flood-affected sugar cane fields are near the river banks. The canes from near the river banks have highest recovery rate, meaning they yield more sugar per tonne of crushed cane. Meanwhile, the millers said owing to partially damaged sugar canes, the overall production of sugar will be less and it will affect the capacity of mills to get loans from the bank to pay to the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mills-to-submit-cane-cutting-plan-in-flood-affected-areas/articleshow/87190896.cms||---

All major projects and schemes announced by the former CM have been put on hold and a few may be dropped altogether. A key source privy to the development said, “After the change of guard in the state government, many top schemes and projects promoted by former CM Vijay Rupani have been put on hold without any formal written instructions.” Listing some of these projects, a source said, “Schemes such as the allocation of around 50,000 hectares of unproductive land to corporates or individuals for horticulture have been put on hold and are unlikely to get final approval. A number of others, such as the Rajkot-Ahmedabad access-controlled expressway, the Rajkot-Ahmedabad semi-high speed rail services, medical device park and toy manufacturing park in Rajkot and other projects have not got the necessary approvals from the state government.” A source close to the developments said, “At present, all the major decisions taken by the former CM Vijay Rupani and former deputy CM Nitin Patel have been put on hold and the CM is likely to take a fresh view on each in the next few days. The much-touted pet scheme of Rupani’s, giving 50,000 hectares of wasteland for horticulture to companies and non-farmer individuals, has been put on hold and will in all likelihood be dropped.” A source added, “Likewise, Rupani’s announcement of giving land to industries for an annual rent of a mere 6% of the land cost, incentives for electric vehicles and incentives under the new tourism policy have also been put on hold by the departments concerned.” Projects Rupani announced for Rajkot may also be reviewed. “Rupani’s announcements like the Rajkot-Ahmedabad semi-high speed train (Rs 11,300 crore) project, Rajkot-Ahmedabad access-controlled expressway, Rajkot toy park and Rajkot medical device park are also on hold. Many of them may be dropped or revised,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/former-cm-rupanis-pet-projects-face-uncertainty/articleshow/87192923.cms||Kapil Dave

The proposal has been submitted to UT adviser Dharam Pal. In a recent meeting, the adviser had asked the urban planning department to submit a proposal for utilisation of the land. Sources said in Sector 52 (opposite Sector 43 bus stand) and on the dividing road of sectors 51-52 (on the side of Sector 52), a commercial belt will be developed on the pattern of Sector 22 (as in front of Sector 17 bus stand). The commercial area lane of sectors 22, 35, 43 will now continue up to Sector 52. Sources said the central area in sectors 52 and 56 will be developed as green belts and a banquet hall is also planned on the land that was recently vacated by slum-dwellers. Earlier, there were other options as well, including auction of land, auction of commercial area after developing it on the vacant land and health facilities or group housing societies. The administration took possession of the 25 acres in sectors 52 and 56 eight months back after rehabilitating slum-dwellers, who had encroached upon it in the early 1990s. The land is earmarked for expansion plans of the third phase of the city. The administration had relocated around 1,700 families within two months. The allottees were provided flats in Maloya under the affordable housing scheme with water and electricity connections. A list of occupants of prefab shelters in sectors 52 and 56 was prepared after a survey was conducted from September 29 to October 1, 2020, and 1,769 families were allotted EWS flats in Maloya-I, the construction of which had begun in June 2014 at Rs 250 crore. CHB is the nodal body for the construction of rehabilitation colonies. So far, it has built 12,736 of the 25,728 flats proposed. Of these, around12,000 were built in Sector 38 (W), Sector 49, Dhanas, Mauli Jagran-II and Ram Darbar. The administration rehabilitates slum-dwellers after conducting a biometric survey. The colonies resettled in the past 10 years include Colony Number 5, Nehru Colony, Kuldeep Colony and Mazdoor Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sectors-52-56-banquet-hall-green-belts-commercial-area-proposed/articleshow/87192914.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Minister for social welfare and Dharmapuri MLA Koppula Eshwar, who had a bad experience with ‘truck’ symbol in the 2018 assembly elections, is now showing ballot papers and urging voters not to get confused with symbols. In Huzurabad, the election authorities have allotted two car-like symbols — roadroller and roti maker — to independent candidates. Eshwar, who has been campaigning in the constituency, has said the truck symbol had secured 13,600 votes in his constituency, Dharmapuri, in the 2018 assembly elections. Showing an EVM ballot paper model to the voters during his campaigning in the 4th ward in Jammikunta, the minister said the car symbol was second from the top in the ballot and he insisted that it was not the second (roti maker) from the bottom. The minister said voters should not get confused with similar-looking symbols.

With Pune airport being shut, the travellers from western Maharashta are arriving at Kolhapur and that’s what is being seen as the reason behind the increase in footfall. Kolhapur airport director Kamal Kumar Kataria said, “Wednesday turned out to be big day for Kolhapur airport post second wave of Covid-19 as a total of 592 one-day figure was achieved comprising 306 passenger arrivals and 286 departures from 10 flights. The temporary closure of the Pune airport has been a reason as regular fliers from Pune and from cities like Satara, Sangli, who wanted to travel to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Tirupati are, preferring the Kolhapur airport.” He added, “The flight service between Kolhapur-Mumbai, which was affected last month due to some operational glitches, has been resumed and operations have got streamlined as earlier. A meeting was held by district guardian minister Satej Patil on Thursday morning regarding the 64-acre land acquisition issue and other ongoing developments at the Kolhapur airport.

---||Delhi||DDA offers parks to public for art and culture events||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is known for only renting out its undeveloped parks and other land parcels for weddings and other functions. However, it now wants its greens to be “more engaging” by allowing booking of parks for entertainment, performance and other cultural and art-oriented events, apart from picnics and school activities. A policy has been launched by DDA for booking parks as a step towards making green areas under its jurisdiction not only more engaging, but also to turn them into vibrant city spaces. The total green areas maintained by the authority are spread across nearly 16,000 acres, which include the popular Hauz Khas Park, Swarn Jayanti Park in Rohini to small neighbourhood parks and the Yamuna riverfront. Around 20 parks are now available for taking on rent. While the earmarked greens are mostly large district parks with open areas clearly delineated for the purpose, some also boast of specific facilities, like amphitheatres, picnic huts and boat clubs. The parks can be booked by individuals, registered cultural and educational societies, educational institutions like schools, colleges and universities, registered NGOs, residents welfare associations and registered companies. Sources in DDA said the aim of the policy was better utilisation of DDA’s greens, including spacious amphitheatres in some parks that are seldom used and where art and cultural events can be easily organised. The parks, however, are strictly off-limits for political functions and marriage ceremonies. Apart from a three-acre site on the Yamuna riverfront, the other greens include Millennium Park next to Ring Road, Sanjay Lake in Mayur Vihar, Coronation Park in Burari, Astha Kunj near Nehru Place, Hauz Khas Park, Rohini’s Swarna Jayanti Park and district parks in Dwarka, Hari Nagar and Saket, apart from smaller parks like Vasant Udyan at Vasant Vihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-offers-parks-to-public-for-art-and-culture-events/articleshow/87193888.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra trying to delay probe into transfers, say AG, ASG||MUMBAI: The state had, in a fresh petition, approached the high court, for orders to set up a special investigation team (SIT) to replace a CBI probe into its FIR against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and allegations of corruption in police transfers and postings in his term, and to have the probe monitored by court or a retired judge. Arguing before a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal in a hybrid hearing, with attorney general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aman Lekhia, Khambata said “the functional bias’’ to the probe occurred from when Jaiswal was appointed to CBI as director in May 2021. As interim relief the state wanted a stay on further investigations by CBI into the FIR against Deshmukh. CBI had issued summons, which expired on October 21, to chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, who was former additional chief secretary (home) and to state DGP Sanjay Pandey in its probe. The AG and ASG, including Anil Singh in Mumbai, sought time to file a reply to oppose the state petition as “factually and legally misconceived’’ and an “attempt to delay the probe, and help the accused’’, adding that the state has no role to play. HC granted Centre time till October 28 to file its reply and an oral liberty to state or Kunte and Pandey to approach court if they receive fresh summons by then. Adjourning the hearing, the court said if it grants an interim stay on the probe as sought, as it could mean virtually commenting on merit. “Every single decision (on posting) was unanimous,’’ said Khambata, adding it was a matter of critical importance to the state and crucial to have a fair and unbiased probe, and members of the board will have to be called, and as head of the board, Jaiswal’s “conduct and motive will be investigated’’. He clarified, “I am not prejudging’’. Khambata said at the heart of the investigation was a surveillance report by ex-state intel chief Rashmi Shukla, who had handed her report to Jaiswal, then DGP. He added, “We have a stellar system of law’’ but if CBI continues the probe, then “why not have Deshmukh as head of CBI? It is as good as that’’. Khambata said, “I cannot believe that the Centre or CBI is going to oppose’’ its plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-trying-to-delay-probe-into-transfers-say-ag-asg/articleshow/87194771.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad bypoll: 28-yr-old youth believes he is destined to be lawmaker||HYDERABAD: The stars, he says, have foretold him that he would become a lawmaker. This is one of the strong reasons why Vemula Vikram Reddy of Jaina village in Jagtial’s Dharmapuri mandal is in the electoral fray from Huzurabad. Ask the 28-year-old whether he has any astrological predictions to be sure of his victory in the elections and he is quick to reply: “Me sitting in the assembly or Parliament is for sure. Whether it will happen now or in the future is something I cannot say but it will indeed happen.” Vikram, who has a diploma in astrology from Telugu University, is not just banking on planetary positions that will grant him the favour. “I have a fiery passion to serve the people. This is what will take me places,” Vikram told TOI. Vikram’s love affair with the ballot box began when as a 20-year-old while pursuing his second year degree studies, he threw his hat in the ring for the election of a ward member in his village. In the election held in 2013, he lost by a whisker with six votes. He then contested as an MPTC member. “Two political parties made me believe that they would support me but they did not,” he recalled. Vikram graduated into contesting for the assembly polls and filed his nomination from the Korutla assembly constituency in the 2018 polls. “I did it to raise my voice in support of farmers. I am an agriculturist,” he said. He lost the polls but the cause was not lost. “We were able to inspire many farmers to be in the fray,” he explained. From the lost battle of Kortula, he moved on with his mission and contested in the Dubbak bypoll last year. “We wanted to bring focus to the issue of unemployment,” he said. In the Nagarjunasagar bypolls this year, he contested again and lost. In all the elections, he has entered as an independent candidate. “It is not right to loosely use the word ‘defeat’. I have gained a lot of knowledge from contesting in all the polls. My resolve only gets stronger to take up the issues of farmers and youth,” Vikram said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/28-yr-old-youth-believes-he-is-destined-to-be-lawmaker/articleshow/87193891.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Authorities of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that 18 new cases have been reported this month alone so far, taking the total dengue affected number in entire BMC area to about 34this year till date. Civic officials said that the number of dengue affected have been an all time low this year, contrary to the last few years, specially in the three years stretching from 2016 to 2019 where several thousands were affected and 20 persons died from dengue. “Contrary to the situation in the city, the number of dengue affected have been very low this year so far. October is generally considered to be the peak month for dengue and compared to the last few years, the number of dengue cases have been very low. There has also been no dengue death reported so far. As for malaria, there has been hardly any cases till now,” said a BMC official. Civic authorities said that they were continuing with mosquito larvicide spraying in all the wards and urging residents to see that there is no stagnant water accumulation in anywhere inside their houses. In New Town, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) released one lakh guppy fish at several waterbodies and canals across New Town during puja as part of its dengue control measures and plan to engage an agency to conduct door to door survey, larvicide spraying and fogging to control vector borne diseases for the next one year. “The waterbodies have been an area of concern as one lakh guppy fish was released during puja. An agency is now being planned to be engaged that will conduct house to house survey across the township to do a fever survey to find out whether anybody in the family was suffering from dengue or malaria or from any Covid related symptoms,” said a NKDA official. If anybody of the family is found to be having any such symptoms, they would be advised to do a dengue and Covid test. NKDA have already installed a dengue Eliza NS 1 reader machine at NKDA bhavan for residents of New Town to have free dengue test. Officials said that several residents have already availed the service. The authorities will also use drone surveillance to check out any accumulation of stagnant water on roof tops or road side corners in New Town alongside making loudspeaker announcements through the drones. NKDA also plans to take up a programme to train residents living in high rise complexes and gated communities to take up dengue prevention measures on their own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-bidhannagar-dengue-21-10-21/articleshow/87192957.cms||Suman Chakraborti

During a health review meeting held at the district administrative complex on Thursday, deputy commissioner Isha Kalia said the district administration had decided to rope in private hospitals to assist in preventive measures such as fogging, container survey and awareness campaigns. She also instructed health officials to identify disease hotspots. Listing measures to combat dengue in the district, Kalia said all multi-purpose health workers had been deputed on dengue prevention activities. She directed them to conduct checks, particularly at sites where mosquitoes were breeding. She instructed them to carry out cleanliness drives specifically in areas where breeding grounds had been detected. The DC, who was accompanied by civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur and district epidemiologist Dr Vikrant Nagra, asked the management of private hospitals to increase dedicated beds for dengue patients and not to refuse treatment to anyone. She said if a private hospital did not have enough beds for dengue patients, they should be guided for further treatment. She said card-based testing had been banned and only ELISA enzyme-linked immunoassay tests were allowed. If private hospitals had the facility of ELISA testing they will continue the practice but if not, samples had to be sent to government hospitals for testing, she said. She added that the state government had fixed Rs 600 as test fee. Kalia added that a google sheet was generated for private hospitals to fill data of bed availability on a daily basis. The google sheet, she said, would be made available on the website of the district administration, https://sasnagar.nic.in to check availability of beds. The meeting was attended by members of the management at Fortis, Ace heart, Shalby, Grecian, Ivy, Guru Harkrishan, Max, Indus, Mehar Super Speciality, Indus and Cheema hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-admn-ropes-in-pvt-hospitals-for-dengue-prevention/articleshow/87192947.cms||---
---||Delhi||Illegal temple: HC fumes at govt’s change of stance||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday rapped Delhi government for referring the matter of removal of a temple, allegedly encroaching on public land in south Delhi, to its religious committee for approval. The court pointed out that the government had earlier assured of its plans to remove the illegally-constructed temple in south Delhi’s Defence Colony but now had changed its stand by referring the case to the religious committee. “What is the scope of the committee? A few bricks put by somebody will fall within its mandate? One can understand if it’s a big temple, but this one has come up overnight...there are just a few bricks and idols,” justice Rekha Palli remarked, seeking a copy of the order setting up the religious committee. However, the counsel for the government cited law and order problems and maintained that proper procedure needs to be followed, which is why the matter has been referred to the committee for its nod. He also sought time to file a report in this regard. But the court was unimpressed and pointed out that “the whole of Delhi may get encroached” if every such structure with bricks and idols put overnight has to be referred to the committee. “What if someone puts something outside this court? Will you send it to the committee? This will lead to total chaos,” the court said, posting the matter for further hearing next week. The court is hearing a plea seeking removal of encroachment in front of a property. The government had earlier submitted that the authorities are conscious of their duty and have already planned to remove the illegal encroachment on October 4. The counsel had said it is necessary to have police assistance to carry out the drive and assured the court that police would render the necessary help to Delhi government’s PWD to carry out the drive on Monday. The plea said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, somebody trespassed and illegally constructed a temple on public land that is a footpath at Bhishma Pitamah Marg, right in front of the petitioners’ property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/illegal-temple-hc-fumes-at-govts-change-of-stance/articleshow/87193892.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||HC asks Zee to call EGM over Invesco demand||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday asked the board of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (Zee) to call for a special shareholders’ meet as demanded by largest investor Invesco to remove MD Punit Goenka from the company. However, it added that the voting result of the special shareholders meet or extraordinary general meeting (EGM) must be “kept in abeyance” till it decides on the legality of the demand raised by Invesco. The EGM resolution will be subject to the information and broadcasting ministry’s approval, the court further said. Besides the ouster of Goenka from Zee, American fund Invesco, which holds nearly 18% in the media and entertainment company, has sought the induction of multiple independent directors on the board of the investee. The court also asked the warring parties to propose an EGM date and name of a neutral chairman to conduct the meeting. Zee will inform the court about the EGM date on Friday. In that case, Invesco will withdraw its petition against Zee from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) where it had complained that the company failed to announce an EGM date to remove Goenka. The matter at NCLT is slated for hearing on October 26. The Bombay high court said that Zee’s right to contest the validity of the resolutions after the EGM can be reserved and that it was premature to assume that the resolutions will be passed or not. On Thursday, the Bombay high court was hearing a case filed by Zee that sought to declare Invesco’s demand as invalid on grounds that it suffered from multiple legal infirmities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-asks-zee-to-call-egm-over-invesco-demand/articleshow/87195531.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Mumbai||Will Rashmi Shukla be named accused, HC asks Mumbai cops||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday asked Mumbai Police to clarify its position and place on record the progress report pertaining to the “illegal” phone-tapping case registered by it, and inform it if senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, also former commissioner of state intelligence department, will be named as an accused in the case. “What is the stage of investigation? FIR is of March 2021. If she (Shukla) is not going to be named as accused, why should we hear this petition? We are only on the point of judicial time,’’ said the bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, which was hearing Shukla’s plea challenging the FIR, registered in March under the Official Secrets Act, 1923, against unknown persons for alleged ‘leak’ of her ‘top secret’ report into phone taps. The court asked the state to clarify and posted the next hearing to October 25. The state continued its statement assuring that no coercive action, including arrest, would be taken against Shukla till the next hearing. BKC cyber police station registered the case against unidentified persons. Senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Shukla, who concluded his submissions for quashing of FIR, iterated that Maharashtra government’s action was “arbitrary”, as it has not named her an accused as per the state affidavit, and that it was acting with “vendetta” against her. Jethmalani had also argued that in the alternate, his plea would be that since CBI was probing the corruption case, let it investigate “the other aspect of the matter”. He sought transfer of the Mumbai Police probe to CBI. Former advocate general Darius Khambata, appearing for state government, said Shukla has “blown up the matter out of proportion”, while the content of the report or whether surveillance was authorised were not subject matter of the Mumbai Police probe. He added that Shukla had not been named as an accused yet and police are only investigating the ‘leak’. The HC said, “Then, as and when she is named as an accused, she can move court again. Please clarify the current position,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-rashmi-shukla-be-named-accused-hc-asks-mum-cops/articleshow/87194799.cms||---

The department of higher education has even allotted money for the repairs which has reached the accounts of many schools. Other schools are yet to receive the funds. In September government had hinted schools and colleges might be reopened after the festive season in a graded manner if the Covid-19 cases don’t rise. “We have submitted all the reports regarding the condition of the structures of the schools and the infrastructure. The government has already allotted funds for the repairs and renovation and in many districts schools have already started carrying out the repairs. In other districts school authorities are waiting for the funds to be allocated to them,” said Haridas Ghatak, president of Advanced Society for Headmasters and Headmistresses. The government has already allocated 110 crores to carry out the renovations in schools. For close to 400 government and government aided schools in Kolkata and suburbs the funds allotted are Rs 7 crores. “We are going to utilise the amount to repair the roof of the school building. Since the school has been shut since March 2020 water had been accumulating on the terrace and seeping inside,” said the principal of a Kolkata government school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zee-schools-21/10/21/articleshow/87192980.cms||---

Two of the attackers were arrested from Mathura on Thursday, police said. The victims were identified as Puneet Sharma and Rupinder Dahiya. Both of them were stabbed four times. “Dahiya had given a loan of Rs 22,000 to one Gaurav Tyagi, who had assured him that he will return the money at the beginning of October,” an officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav said Dahiya was demanding his money back, but Gaurav was avoiding his calls. “On Monday, there was an argument between the two on this issue,” he stated. According to police, on Monday, Tyagi made a phone call to Dahiya and told him to come to Badli village to receive his money. “When Dahiya, along with his friend Sharma, reached the Tyagi’s house, they were attacked by Tyagi and four of his associates with knives,” the officer said, adding that they all fled the spot after the incident. On the statement of Sharma, a case under Section 307 IPC was registered. “Technical surveillance revealed that phone numbers of two of the accused were active in Mathura.

---||Chandigarh||Expert gives tips on celebrations minus the flab||With festivities around the corner, dieticians warn against a carbohydrate overload. Former senior dietician at PGI, Dr Madhu Sharma tells Shimona Kanwar how to prevent a deranged bio-chemical profile and yet enjoy Dussehra, Diwali and Christmas. What are the main items one tends to binge on during festivals and how to eat mindfully? We love our carbs, but we need to have a little palette for the more important proteins and fibre in our day-to-day eating pattern - be it a typical routine day or festival days. It’s not too difficult to tweak our diet by a little mindful eating. We need to be careful about the choices we make to include or avoid specific foods to maintain good health. I often see people actually gaining weight by the end of the fasting festivals. It’s not surprising since their foods comprise high carb cereals like sago, potatoes, sugar or jaggery, fruits and juices. Also, most of the foods are fried, adding to the fat content. Milk may be a component too, but it could be full fat or in the form of khoya or paneer, though good protein sources are high in calories too. To top it all, since these articles are very appetising, one may indulge rather than limit the portion size. These may add an appreciable amount of inch gain on their hips and/or waistline or deeper down, may present as a deranged bio-chemical profile in terms of deranged blood lipid or glucose levels. Is it correct that calorie count must be restricted or does it depend on the source? Festivities are all about enjoying delicacies in moderation and keeping portion size in mind. It’s not just about calorie for calorie count but what the total calories comprise, the way the calorie sources are prepared and the combination of the various calorie sources consumed. For a normal healthy individual on a relatively balanced healthy diet, indulging on an occasional portion (on special occasions) of any sweet like a barfi or a besan laddoo or a rasgulla may be quite safe, provided it is not routine, or the portion and serving sizes are not large. Only when consumption of such items becomes regular in addition to an unhealthy eating pattern and lifestyle, do the adverse effects begin to set in. Individuals with any co-morbidity like obesity, diabetes or cardiac issues would need to be extra cautious. They would do well with professional help on how they may include such items in their diet, since one size does not fit all and need customised approach. Can a diet chart help celebrate festivals without putting on extra flab? There is no one size fits all concept as was previously thought. It all depends on lifestyle, BMI, age and other components. For instance, there is nothing as a diabetic diet. The food chart is individualised and varies from person to person. However, the crux is that you burn the extra calories consumed, which can be known by wearable smart health devices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/expert-gives-tips-on-celebrations-minus-the-flab/articleshow/87192989.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Now, however, the state health department plans to go from door to door in several pockets of the state to ensure 100% vaccination. As India, on Thursday, crossed the 100-crore vaccine milestone, Gujarat also crossed the figure of 6.8 crore, including 4.4 crore first and 2.4 crore second doses of vaccine. State health minister Rushikesh Patel on Thursday said that three cities and four districts have recorded 100% vaccination, whereas a sustained campaign is on to identify those who are eligible but have still not taken the jab. “Overall 90% of eligible population has got the first dose,” he said. “With 6.86 lakh persons out of every 10 lakh getting both doses, Gujarat leads among major states.” Health department officials said that they have launched three major initiatives to enforce 100% vaccination adherence. This included regular monitoring of government offices, monitoring of private commercial entities with 100 or more staff, and recording vaccination status of patients at government-run health facilities. “Doctors will sensitize those who have not yet got the vaccine and dispel myths if any,” said a senior health department official. On the other hand, cities like Ahmedabad have launched incentives to increase the percentage. Dr Bhavin Solanki, AMC health officer, said that AMC has vaccinated labourers and homeless persons during night hours and even vaccinating those who did not have identity proof. Other cities and districts have also incentivized vaccination by providing freebies or imposing rules such as allowing access to government-run facilities only to those who furnish vaccination certificate. Sources said that completing the remaining 10% is a challenge. “People’s reluctance to get vaccinated is a major roadblock,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/100-coverage-in-3-cities-4-districts/articleshow/87193005.cms||---

Till 7pm on Thursday, 1,99,08,367 doses had been administered in the city. This included 1,28,45,062 first doses and 70,63,305 second doses. With the number of beneficiaries eligible for the vaccine in Delhi being around 1.5 crore, it meant that 85.6% of the eligible population had received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine and nearly half — 47% — had been fully vaccinated. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Congratulations to the countrymen on 100 crore vaccinations. Salute to the doctors, nurses and frontline workers who made this possible. All of us countrymen faced this disease together. Together we will defeat it forever.” 100 करोड़ टीके लगने पर सभी देशवासियों को बधाईजिन डाक्टर्ज़, नर्सेज़ और frontline workers की वजह से ये संभव हुआ, उ… https://t.co/pKKEeRSbFD— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1634794623000In Delhi, almost 64% of the Covid jabs, or 1,27,10,430, have been given to those in the 18-44 age category. The number administered to those in the 45-59 age group is 47,88,752, which is 24% of the total. People aged 60 years and above have received 24,09,185 doses, or slightly more than 12% of the total. Delhi would have crossed the two-crore mark on Thursday, but compared with the two lakh injections given till recently, the daily numbers in recent days have come down slightly; on Thursday, only 74,661 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 10pm. Officials said that the numbers were on the lower side due to the current festive season. Since it started on January 16 this year, the doses administered reached a weekly high of nearly 11 lakh between June 26 and July 2 before seeing a dip. It reached an all-time high of 11.6 lakh jabs between September 18 and 24. More than two lakh people got injected in a single day on September 25 and September 27, but the numbers have not crossed the two-lakh mark in a day since then. While it took from January 16 6o July 31 for the number of doses administered in Delhi to cross the one-crore mark, it took exactly a month and a half for more than 50 lakh more people to be vaccinated due to the higher number of jabs being administered in the months of August and September.  If the cumulative doses administered in Delhi crosses the two-crore mark on Friday, the last 50 lakh vaccine doses would also have taken around a month and a half to be administered. The highest number of doses administered has been in North-West district among all the revenue districts of the capital at 23,81,145. It is followed by the South-West (22,98,270) and West (21,23,668) districts. In contrast, the North-East district saw the least number of doses being administered: 12,46,732.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-delhi-within-touching-distance-of-2cr/articleshow/87193052.cms||Sidharatha Roy

On March 3, 2012, the police searched the journalist’s house in Kuthlur, Belthangady taluk on the periphery of the Kudremukh National Park and arrested them.  Advocate Dinesh Ulepady said that the police had seized binoculars, groceries, and a book on Revolutionary Bhagat Singh – and letters to the government, wherein Vittala had made appeals for the construction of roads, had called for a boycott of elections among others. In the aftermath of his house being searched, a case was registered against the father-son duo under IPC Sections 120 (B) and Sections 19 and 20 of the Unlawful Activity (Prevention) Act.  Vittala and his father subsequently spent three months in prison, during which time the journalist even appeared for an examination. When in jail several political leaders including CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat visited the jail. The issue was also raised in the parliament by a Kerala MP M B Rajesh, recalled Vittala who said justice had prevailed, after being acquitted.  Vittala was a first-year student pursuing journalism at Mangalore University when he was arrested. He lived along with his family in Kuthlur village, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Naravi gram panchayat and they had to go on a two-hour trek through the forest from the nearest bus stop to reach home which is on the remote fringes of the jungle.  Vittala was speaking regularly to journalists and was considered a point of contact to reach members of the Malekudiya community. There were instances of journalists staying with him at his house when they were in Dakshina Kannada to study the Naxal movement. It was while they sojourned at his house that Vittala developed an interest in journalism. A few journalists working in Mangaluru agreed to support him and helped him gain admission to Mangalore University. They also helped him get books and imparted lessons in English. After his release from jail, he had even contested the gram panchayat and zilla panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/journalist-father-accused-of-having-ties-to-maoists-acquitted/articleshow/87191441.cms||---

The court will hear this application on Friday afternoon. Ashish is the main accused in the death of four farmers and a journalist during the farmers’ protest held on October 3. Earlier, the CJM court had granted a 3-day PCR for the other four co-accused. They were sent to jail on Tuesday. Ashish’s counsel, Avdhesh Singh, has also filed a bail application in the court of the district judge. The court has sought the case diary from the SIT and has decided to hear the bail application on October 28. An earlier bail application of Ashish was rejected by the CJM on October 13. Avdhesh Singh told TOI, “The argument on bail application will happen if the investigating officer brings the case diary to court. Otherwise, another date would be given. There is no public witness, no video or audio evidence to prove that my client was involved in the crime.” On Wednesday, the SIT had recovered the third vehicle of Ashish Mishra’s convoy that had allegedly mowed down the farmers and a journalist in Tikunia on October 3. The white Scorpio is now kept at the Sampoornanagar police station and is registered in the name of a Canada-based NRI.  According to sources, the NRI had sold his car to a BJP leader in Palia town, but the ownership of the vehicle had not changed. Notably, the first vehicle, a Thar jeep, got stuck on the roadside after mowing down the men, while the second vehicle, a Fortuner registered under the name of Ankit Das, a Lucknow-based contractor, lost control and turned. Both were later set on fire by angry farmers. The SIT has also recorded the statements of the kin of deceased BJP workers, along with that of the farmers who were summoned. Speaking about the matter, special prosecution officer S P Yadav said, “The CJM has granted the PCR of Sumit Jaiswal and Shishupal (who was driving the third SUV, a white Scorpio), Nandan Singh Bisht, and Satya Prakash Tripathi. I have moved an application for another PCR of Ashish Mishra, Ankit, Shekhar, and Lateef, which will be heard on Friday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-sit-seeks-police-remand-of-ministers-son-again/articleshow/87191873.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

This time, the post of Gandhinagar’s mayor for the first term of two-and-a-half-years has been reserved for a corporator from the scheduled caste (SC) category. The fifth mayor of the capital city, Makwana will remain on the post for two and a half years, following which a woman will be elected as the mayor for the remaining term as per laid down guidelines. “I thank the BJP and its leadership for giving me this responsibility. Gandhinagar city was developed extensively by our predecessors. Now, we will extend this development to 18 villages and Pethapur municipality, which have been newly added to the GMC,” Makwana told reporters. The new Gandhinagar mayor is son of former BJP MLA Punambhai Makwana and husband of actress Roma Manek. During the meeting, BJP corporator Premalsinh Gol was elected as the new deputy mayor of Gandhinagar, while Jaswant Patel became the chairman of the standing committee. In the recently held polls to the GMC, the ruling BJP retained power by winning 41 of total 44 seats of 10 wards, decimating both the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party by huge margins. While the Congress won two seats, AAP won just one seat. Since the inception of the GMC in 2010, this is the first time that the BJP has won a clear-cut victory in the GMC election. In the first election held in 2011, the Congress had won a majority, winning 18 seats, while the BJP won 15. However, three Congress councillors defected to the BJP, giving it a majority in the GMC. In the second election in 2016, BJP and the Congress were tied at 16 seats apiece. A Congress councillor Pravin Patel defected to the BJP, and was rewarded with the post of mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/makwana-is-new-gnagar-mayor/articleshow/87193084.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||GMB extends deadline for Nargol bids||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has decided to extend the October 21 deadline for bids to develop the greenfield port at Nargol by two months. The decision comes following requests by prospective bidders such as Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) and DP World, a Dubai-based logistics company, who sought more time to conduct surveys at the site before they can submit proposals, a government official said. Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the state’ maritime regulator, has extended the deadline to December 21 for global bids to develop Nargol port with an initial investment of Rs 3,800 crore, said sources. Apart from Adani and DP World, JSW Group and Essar Group have expressed interest by participating in the pre-bid meetings, sources said. Located about 140km north of Mumbai and 120km south of Surat, Nargol was proposed to be a multi-function port capable of managing solid, liquid, and container cargo. Nargol was confirmed as the new port site after a port project at Maroli, approximately 10km away from Nargol, was abandoned due to protests from local fishermen.  “GMB gave the prospective bidders some pre-feasibility reports, however the companies want to conduct in-depth site surveys to confirm financial viability, connectivity and other aspects before submitting their bids,” said an industry official. About two years ago, GMB cancelled the work awarded to a consortium of Cargo Motors Pvt Ltd and Israel Ports Co for development of Nargol port project in 2012. This was after the company missed several project execution deadlines. The Gujarat government has put the greenfield project on fast-track at a time when plans are underway for a new port to be developed at Vadhavan in neighbouring Maharashtra, about 50km away from Nargol. To make the project attractive, GMB has for the first time offered a discount of 20% on waterfront charges according to its Schedule of Port Charges (SoPC). Also, the concession period under the state’s Build Operate Own and Transfer (BOOT) policy has been extended from 30 years to 50 years. The discount will lead to better feasibility parameters and will help the developer raise capital at lower costs, said sources in GMB. The state has so far seen successful completion of four private ports — at Mundra, Pipavav, Dahej and Hazira — according to the proposed waterfront royalty mechanism. In addition, three private ports are in advanced stages of implementation — at Jaffarabad, Chhara and Bhavnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmb-extends-deadline-for-nargol-bids/articleshow/87193046.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt rolls back class strength cuts||AHMEDABAD: The commissionerate of schools of the Gujarat education department has suspended its earlier order that allowed the reduction in the number of students per classroom at grant-in aid schools of the state. The earlier order was due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year, but this year it has been revoked with the number of cases having gone down substantially in the last few months and the situation seemingly under control, sources in the education department said. Last year, a resolution was passed for the academic year 2020-21 by the education department that made some relaxations in the number of students required in each class for Classes 9 to 12 at grant-in aid schools. “For instance, in urban areas, class strength was reduced to 25 instead of 36 for schools with one classroom per grade. This has now been restored to 36 students per class,” said a source in the education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-rolls-back-class-strength-cuts/articleshow/87193088.cms||---

It has increased the fund-raise programme from Rs 3,000 crore after a re-evaluation of its requirement.  In August, it had decided to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore through a rights offering. But, on Thursday, it modified its capital-increase programme and now will raise Rs 2,000 crore via a rights issue and another Rs 2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). At Taj’s annual shareholder meet in June this year, its chairman N Chandrasekaran had said that capital infusion in some form in the company is important. It will not only help to navigate the immediate months but also prepare for the future. Taj said on Thursday that the equity issuances are to make the company “zero-debt” in the future and to finance growth plans. It has a debt of Rs 3,571 crore on its books. Taj parent Tata Sons will be subscribing to a substantial chunk of the Rs 2,000-crore rights issue considering it holds 38% in the hospitality chain. In case of under-subscription, the rights issue will be backed by Tata Sons. On Thursday, IHCL reported a loss of Rs 131 crore for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-hotels-to-raise-rs-4000-crore/articleshow/87195563.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Elderly man seriously injured in early morning robbery bid||PUNE: A 70-year-old man suffered a hip-bone fracture and injuries to his head and leg after he was brutally attacked by three teenagers in a bid to rob him while he was on a morning walk on October 19. The incident occurred at 6am near Parnakuti Paytha, a short distance from the Parnakuti police chowkey at the end of Bund Garden bridge. The police later arrested one of the trio, 18 years old, and detained his two minor accomplices, 16 and 17 years old. Under questioning, the youngsters also confessed to assaulting three others, including a woman, for money. The other three have yet to approach the police, however. The victim of the most recent assault, Dnyanadeo Kusalkar (70), a resident of Laxminagar in Yerawada, is undergoing treatment in a private hospital. His condition was reported as stable. Kusalkar’s grandson, Akshay, told TOI on Thursday, “We learnt about the incident when some passersby rushed to my grandfather’s aid and brought him to our house in an autorickshaw. He was in pain and we moved him to a private hospital for treatment.” Akshay said the three youngsters accosted his grandfather when he was on a walk, and demanded that he hand over his money, cellphone and valuables. “My grandfather urged them to spare him as he was not carrying any cash or valuables, but the trio frisked him and assaulted him when they found no money on him.” Akshay said his grandfather somehow managed to free himself and run away. “But he tripped and fell. The trio once again set upon him. One of them picked up a stone and hit him on the head, severely injuring him. They then fled. We later came to know from passersby that the trio had targeted three people, including a woman, before attacking my grandfather,” said Akshay. Sub-inspector Ravindrakumar Warangule, who is investigating the case, on Thursday that they recorded Kusalkar’s statement from the hospital bed. “He gave us the description of the robbers. A CCTV camera captured their images. We identified the attackers. A team under senior inspector Yunus Shaikh arrested an 18-year-old youth and detained the two minors,” Warangule said. “We are in the process of establishing the identity of three other robbery victims,” he added. Police said the 18-year-old suspect was a school dropout and that his father worked for a catering firm; his mother left his father. The 17-year-old studied till Std XII, while the other minor had failed his SSC board exams. Both the boys’ parents are casual workers, police said. A magisterial court has sent the 18-year-old to police custody till Friday, while the minor boys were put in a children’s home. “A case under attempt to commit robbery and voluntarily causing hurt was registered under sections 393, 324, 325 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code,” Warangule said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elderly-man-seriously-injured-in-early-morning-robbery-bid/articleshow/87193060.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Nineteen people were rescued by the NDRF while one was found dead. Two of the survivors are critical and being treated at the district hospital. This is the third such accident reported in 24 hours in the region. Eight people from a boat capsizing incident in the area on Wednesday are still missing. District magistrate (DM) Kheri Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya said, “As many as 1,222 people have been rescued by district administration from flood-affected areas. Three deaths were reported in 48 hours." "The latest incident was reported from Navapur village. A few locals were crossing the Chauka river with vegetables and other items to reach Ghosiana. The water level was not so high in the river, but the boat struck a bridge pillar, lost its balance and capsized," said SDM Sadar Arun Kumar Singh. Palia, Sadar, Gola, Dhaurahra and Nighasan tehsils are affected by the overflowing Ghaghra, Mohana and Sharda rivers. Palia is the worst hit. Local MLA Romi Sahni had to use boats to reach his constituency and distribute flood relief materials. Kitchens in local gurdwaras meanwhile are providing food to affected villagers round the clock. When asked about the current situation, the Kheri DM said, “All the rivers in the district are swollen due to incessant rains in Uttarakhand and Nepal. People were advised to stay away, but they are still venturing out on crowded boats in deep water. We will now seize boats, if we find people moving towards the river without permission. Only the boats with rescue teams and flood relief materials will be allowed to move in the river.” Meanwhile, BJP MP Varun Gandhi visited the flood-affected areas in Pilibhit district where he distributed 5,000 ration packets. The ration packets were arranged by Varun from his own funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/another-boat-capsizes-in-up-19-people-rescued-1-dead-2-critical/articleshow/87191919.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Varanasi||Wait for smooth ride extended as deadline to finish NH-56 missed||Varanasi: As the companies engaged by the National Highway Authority of India missed the deadline for completion of Varanasi-Lucknow highway via Sultanpur (NH-56) and Varanasi-Azamgarh highway (NH-233), people will have to wait for few more weeks to have fast and smooth ride in the complete stretch. Divisional commissioner, Deepak Agrawal said, “NHAI has finished the works on Varanasi-Ghazipur highway (NH-29) and Ring-road phase-2 package-1, hence both these projects will be dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his proposed Varanasi visit on October 25. But, the work near a railway overbridge on Jaunpur bypass on NH-56 and in some stretches of NH-233 could not be completed on the previously fixed deadlines- September 30 and October 15 respectively. Due to this, the possibility of their inauguration on October 25 has ended.” When contacted, NHAI project director Varanasi, RS Yadav said, “Due to some reasons, the company engaged for constructing NH-56 could not finalise the works at a ROB and three under-passes on Jaunpur bypass of this highway. The bypass works are incomplete on two km stretch. On NH-233 works are pending in 400 mt area on Devgaon bypass. On a safe side, we have sought time till December end to finish all pending works on these two highways but all these works are likely to be completed in November.” By going through the records it can be found that the deadline for completion of Rs 868.50 crores NH-29 project, Rs 785 crores NH-233 and Rs 806 crores NH-56 for-lane conversion project were revised multiple times in past. The officials said consecutive Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 and this year hampered works in almost all NHAI projects which had to wait for long to get possession on land acquired for projects in districts like Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Mirzapur and Chandauli on many stretches. Regarding Rs 2100 crore Varanasi-Hanumana (MP border) highway, which is the part of Varanasi-Kanyakumari national highway-7 project, Yadav said works between Dugmugpur in Mirzapur and Lalganj stretch of this project had been completed while road construction between Lalganj and Hanumana will also be finished by November end. The works between Varanasi and Dugmugpur will be completed by May 2022, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/wait-for-smooth-ride-extended-as-deadline-to-finish-nh-56-missed/articleshow/87193061.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Travel agents want runway work deferred||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat chapter of the Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), has sought a deferment of re-carpeting of the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad to March, instead of in January. TAFI members contend that the resultant reduction in flights will affect passenger movements into Gujarat, adversely affecting tourism, which has just begun to revive since the pandemic hit. An email representation was sent to officials of Adani Airports and the Airports Authority of India (AAI), a copy of which is with TOI. The city airport has a complete re-carpeting of the runway scheduled from January 3, 2022 to May 31, 2022, for which it recently received approval from the aviation regulator, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA). In this period, the runway will be closed for flights from 9am to 6pm, which means flights will operate either before 9am or after 6pm. “Due to the Covid pandemic, tourism has been one of the worst hit industries. In the recent days, travel companies are getting some business due to the increase in domestic tourism. The timings and dates for the runway repair will adversely affect business pace for the tourism industry,” the representation by TAFI states. TAFI members have proposed that repair and maintenance work be executed at night i.e. from 10pm to 5am and begin from March 2022. The original plan of the city airport authorities was to undertake the re-carpeting work from November 10, 2021 till May 31, 2022. “Generally, Gujarat sees a lot of in-bound tourist traffic in January and February, especially due to the wedding season,” said Manish Sharma, chairman of the Gujarat chapter of TAFI. At present, some about 190 flights operate from SVPI airport every day, of which 45 each are in the mornings and evenings. The remaining 100 flights are spread through the day. If the runway is closed during the day, 100 flights will be rescheduled and or cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/travel-agents-want-runway-work-deferred/articleshow/87193075.cms||---

An offence was registered against owner of the godown Hemraj Daulatani at Butibori police station. The FDA team, following police tip-off, had also seized betel nut worth more than Rs1 crore earlier this month with back-to-back raids. They also sealed two godowns until samples from these godowns are tested by a government laboratory. In the first raid, FDA team of Food Safety Officer (FSO) PV Manwatkar seized betel nut worth Rs47 lakh from the godown of Jain Supari Centre near Chikhli at Wardhaman Nagar. Samples have been sent to the laboratory for government analysts to ascertain its quality. In another raid, FSO Anand Mahajan seized betel nut worth Rs60 lakh from the godown of Shivraj Trading Company. These samples were also sent to the laboratory for tests and results are awaited. In the latest raid at Butibori, FSO Lalit Soyam under supervision of assistant commissioner ND Mohite zeroed down upon the godown of M/s Ma Sharda Traders on Pandey Colony Road following a tip-off and seized flavoured tobacco. FDA officials said the agency is having a tough time tackling prohibited flavoured tobacco coming in from places like Seoni and Saunsar in MP, where such material is legal and freely available. “We have registered an offence under relevant provisions and handed over the case to police department to probe further links and source of the materials seized in the latest case,” said FSO Soyam. The FDA and police are finding it difficult to thwart smuggling of prohibited flavoured tobacco into Maharashtra from adjoining Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh. Apart from Nagpur, it’s learnt Yavatmal too has turned into a hub of banned flavoured tobacco in Vidarbha with MP-based suppliers having wide network here. With government agencies and a section of police turning blind eye, the migrant labourer population of Yavatmal is the biggest customer base for racketeers. In June, Yavatmal police had seized tobacco worth Rs38 lakh during a raid but it’s learnt the racketeers continue to bring tobacco into Yavatmal from MP. FDA officials claimed betel nut traders, many of whom are now under CBI scanner, are bringing consignments from Kerala and other southern states more frequently than through north-east routes. In Nagpur, several investigating agencies of both central and state governments have now brought interstate smugglers of betel nuts under radar for tax evasion to the tune of thousands of crores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-seizes-320kg-flavoured-tobacco-seals-godown/articleshow/87190989.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Ahead of winter session, NMC to recarpet tar roads in Civil Lines||Nagpur: Ahead of the winter session of state legislature, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is set to give a black-carpet welcome to VVIPs. The civic body has shortlisted a contractor for recarpeting tar roads in Civil Lines. NMC will spend Rs1.19 crore for tarring Board office to RBI Quarter Road to MLA Hostel Square. Similarly, Metro Office Chowk to High Court and Raj Bhavan Square to Katol Naka Square will be recarpeted. The proposal to entrust the work to M/s Premchand Rachumal will come up before the standing committee meeting scheduled to be held on Friday. Earlier, major portions of roads in Civil Lines were being maintained by the state public works department (PWD). Now, all roads are being handed over to NMC. It has also increased the financial burden on the already cash-starved civic body. Currently, the stretches selected in Civil Lines are in tatters and riding vehicles, especially two-wheelers, has become very difficult. Sources pointed out that NMC will speed up the recarpeting of tar roads in Civil Lines in view of the winter session of state legislature commencing in December. Apart from this, the civic body may also take up the work of road markings in the Civil Lines area. PWD has also proposed to convert four tar roads into cement-concrete ones. NMC has estimated an expenditure of over Rs2.53 crore for concretization of these four roads, the proposal tabled before the standing committee revealed. Similarly, NMC has shortlisted 11 other tar roads which were in a bad state for recarpeting. The civic body will spend Rs14.71 crore for recarpeting these roads. The existing tar road from Automotive Square to Samarpan Hospital via Mohammed Rafi Square is in bad shape, and the civic body has selected this road stretch too. For this purpose, it will spend Rs2.83 crore. NMC has also dropped its earlier proposal of converting tar road from Dev Nagar to Khamla Chowk to Ajni Chowk to Wardha road, due to water pipeline crossing beneath the road. After almost a decade, the civic body is set to recarpet these road stretches at a cost of Rs1.25 crore. It has also decided to recarpet the tar road connecting Jaripatka police station to Nara village bus stop road. NMC will incur Rs1.92 crore for recarpeting this road. PWD has submitted these proposals, seeking the standing panel’s nod to invite tenders for recarpeting these roads. NMC is already facing public wrath over bad roads. With the civic body to go for polls early next year, the ruling party would try its best to renovate all bad roads, said sources. Though it has seemingly taken up the pothole repair work on a war footing, many tar roads are still full of craters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ahead-of-winter-session-nmc-to-recarpet-tar-roads-in-civil-lines/articleshow/87191013.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Prime accused at large, mom in custody for plotting murders||KOLKATA: Vicky Haldar, prime accused in the murder of corporate executive Subir Chaki and his driver Robin Mondal, continued to elude police on Thursday. His mother, Mithu, who was arrested on Wednesday, was remanded in police custody till November 3. The detective department has formed separate teams to trace Vicky and his aides, most of them being painters and plumbers from Diamond Harbour and surroundings. Police commissioner Soumen Mitra said on Thursday the detective department, along with other police units, had cracked the double murder case though some of the accused were absconding.  Seeking Mithu’s police custody, public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal said she was actively involved in the planning and commissioning of the murders. She plotted the escape route and was present near Dhakuria station to take away Vicky’s blood-soaked clothes, police said. Mithu was reportedly aware of the cash and gold her son had stolen from Chaki’s Kankulia Road house. After the murder, the accused went to the Ballygunge station and then, to Dhakuria station from where they fled in different directions. Mithu’s in-laws live near the Kankulia rail gate and her knowledge of the area helped her fix the escape routes. “We have produced four seizure lists in court. They included Vicky’s blood-soaked clothes from Mithu’s home. We told court we needed Mithu’s police custody for three reasons: to recover the loot, to uncover the plot and so that she cooperates with us to trace the accused,” Ghosal said.  Vicky, a small-time broker in Diamond Harbour, had wanted to buy the Ballygunge house to resell it. But the price he offered was half the expected rate and Chaki backed out. After that, Mithu and Vicky who posed as an engineer in Metro, plotted to rob Chaki. A couple of months earlier, the mother and son responded to Chaki’s ad for the sale of the house and Vicky visited the place, posing as a buyer. He took on a fake identity, using a different name, mobile number and speaking in English. To stay in the city, Vicky worked as a guard. On Sunday, Vicky, along with his aides, “made an appointment with Chaki” to visit the property under a false name. On opening the door, once Chaki realized it was Vicky, it was too late. Vicky stabbed Chaki to death and robbed him of cash and gold. Mondal, who was on the first floor, did not get time to defend himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prime-accused-at-large-mom-in-custody-for-plotting-murders/articleshow/87193135.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||DPCC, IIT-Kanpur in pact for better management of pollution||NEW DELHI: With Diwali season approaching, sub-divisional magistrates have been authorised to check illegal sale of firecrackers and take direct action in case of violations. People of Delhi have also been urged to report sale/use of firecrackers on the Green Delhi App. Meanwhile, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) signed an MoU with IIT Kanpur on Friday for real-time source apportionment study. Environment minister Gopal Rai said, “The government has issued a complete ban on firecrackers to curb pollution. However, cases of illegal storage and sales have been reported and hence, all SDMs have been instructed to organise anti-cracker campaigns in Delhi. They have been empowered to take action and seize items along with the police. They have been ordered to not harass the public and focus on illegal sales instead.” He added a joint meeting with the police will take place on October 25. Rai said, “Many people might accuse the government of ‘not letting us celebrate Diwali’ and to them, I would say that ‘diye se Diwali hoti hai, patakhe se pollution hota hai’ (Diwali is celebrated with diyas, while crackers cause pollution).” He stressed the need to increase public participation by awareness meetings regarding the chief minister’s 10-point winter action plan. Rai further said the real-time source apportionment project would help in identifying the factors responsible for the spike in air pollution at any spot in Delhi. Weekly, monthly, and seasonal interpretation of air quality will take place, along with additional knowledge of PAHs, molecular markers, and secondary organic and inorganic aerosols.

The formal announcement of this alliance will be made by the SP chief at SBSPs rally on its foundation day at Haldharpur area in Mau district on October 27,” he added. He further said, “There is no dispute on the issue of seat-sharing. Our target is to ensure the defeat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and oust it from power,” said Rajbhar, claiming that the BJP had assured to give 22 seats to SBSP, but spared only eight to contest in the 2017 poll.” “As I had committed to contest as a BJP ally, we fought on only those eight seats,” said Rajbhar. He further claimed that only that party comes to power in UP which enjoys his support. “In the last assembly polls, we were with BJP and it came to power. This time we are going with SP and it will definitely come to power.” Regarding his decision to form an alliance with SP, Rajbhar said, “Our issues are similar. SBSP and SP are demanding caste-wise census, implementation of social justice committee report, relief in power tariff for domestic consumers, free health facilities for women, employment for youths and security for women.” He alleged that “BJP has disturbed social harmony while people want relief from inflation and corruption”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pact-to-be-announced-at-sbsp-mau-rally-sp-chief-will-attend-rajbhar/articleshow/87193104.cms||---

State health department officials said they would send ASHA workers on door-to-door surveys to expand second-dose coverage as they eye the 100% mark by year-end. Vaccinating people who are due for their second doses but have not taken it, however, remains a concern — at present, there are 20.2 lakh recipients who are yet to take their second shot. Out of these, over 4.5 lakh are due for their second shot of Covaxin, while 15.7 lakh haven’t taken their second Covishield jab. According to projected population data, the minimum number of people eligible for Covid vaccinations in the state is 2 crore. First doses have been administered to around 1.8 crore, while 75.8 lakh have received both doses. Gurgaon, which has given most inoculations in the state, is on the brink of 35 lakh Covid vaccinations. The city’s second dose coverage is 71%. “We are aiming to complete second doses of the state’s eligible population by the end of December. We have already carried out more than 85% first-dose vaccination in Haryana at present,” Haryana additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora told TOI. Asked how the state plans to trace people who are due for their second doses, he said, “To achieve 100% second-dose vaccination, we will start house-to-house surveys. This will be done by ASHA workers across the state. Mobile vans will be engaged to carry out second-dose vaccinations at places where the number of second-dose recipients is high.” Meanwhile, Gurgaon has administered 34.5 lakh Covid vaccine doses so far. It has a projected population of nearly 25.8 lakh, out of which 18.3 lakh are eligible for vaccination. Around 21.6 lakh first doses have been administered in Gurgaon till now, which means a coverage of 119%, while 12.9 lakh second doses have been given (71% coverage).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ggn-leads-the-way-in-haryana-with-71-now-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/87193137.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Delhi||EDMC shuts 44 of 61 C&D waste dumping sites||NEW DELHI: Keeping adverse environmental conditions and poor air quality in view, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has shut down 44 out of the 61 sites designated for dumping construction and demolition waste. For the convenience of residents, the civic body will set up a paid on-call service for collecting and transporting the C&D waste from their houses/complexes till the C&D waste plant tentatively by November, said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. Officials said that the step was aimed at stopping people from dumping waste on roadsides illegally and at checking air pollution. As per EDMC’s recent orders, the C&D waste from any under-construction house/building will be sent directly to the C&D waste plant at Shastri Park. “While some of the 61 notified sites were already shut down by us or other agencies, we decided to further reduce their numbers as we are looking for alternative solutions to improve vigilance. An on-call system wherein the concessionaire running the C&D plant will also arrange staff, vehicles for lifting C&D waste from under-construction buildings after charging minimum rates will be enforced soon. The rates, which are presently being paid by EDMC for lifting waste from designated sites, will be applicable in case of residential and other under-construction buildings also,” said the commissioner. The civic body will soon upload on its website the numbers of the concessionaire, minimum quantity that can be lifted and other details for the convenience of residents. “The system will help in checking illegal dumping and unnecessary mess at multiple sites,” said an official. However, the facility of lifting C&D waste through concessionaires will not be applicable in case of under-construction government or institutional complexes. “We are requesting them to arrange the facility on their own and direct the contractor to dump waste directly at the plant. Its capacity has already been increased to 1,000 metric tonnes per day and in the long term, we may set up another C&D waste plant,” said the commissioner. To control pollution levels, the civic body claims to be conducting special inspections for monitoring of biomass burning, unauthorised dumping of C&D waste, polluting industries, etc. “These teams are deployed in two shifts round the clock for monitoring, controlling and penalising the defaulters. Special attention is being paid to the hotspots of Anand Vihar and Vivek Vihar,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-shuts-44-of-61-cd-waste-dumping-sites/articleshow/87213892.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Varanasi||AAP MP stopped from entering city, permission denied for Tiranga Yatra||Times News Network Varanasi: The police of Varanasi commissionerate stopped Aam Adam Party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh from entering the city on Thursday foiling the bid to carry out Tiranga Yatra without taking permission of the administration. Many AAP leaders were also not allowed to move out of their homes while around 40 were held while demonstrating against stopping Singh from entering the city. Angered over the police action, Singh attacked Yogi Adityanath government for not allowing Tiranga Yatra and said that his party has postponed this yatra and new date of carrying out the yatra in Varanasi will be announced soon. According to AAP state spokesman Mukesh Singh, party had announced to carry out Tiranga Yatra from Ambedkar Park Kutchehri to Sardar Patel statue at Maldahiya on Thursday. The administration did not permit the yatra but Singh reached LBSI airport as per the pre-scheduled programme. However, before he could enter the limits of Varanasi commissionerate he was stopped near BHEL unit on airport road by the police. On asking reasons for stopping him the cops mentioned engagement of police forces in festive and VIP duties in view of the arrival of Sri Lankan delegation for not allowing the procession on a busy route. Many AAP activists including women also reached there and started demonstration demanding the cops to allow Singh’s entry in the city. The high voltage drama continued for over four hours. Later, policemen sent around 40 AAP activists to police lines after arranging buses for them. Later, Singh announced to postpone the Tiranga Yatra in Varanasi. Attacking the Yogi government, he said that in UP criminals have permission to commit crimes like loot, murder and rape but the government bans lauding slogans like Bharat Mata ki Jai and carrying out marches with tricolour. When the Tiranga Yatra can be carried out in Noida, Lucknow and Ayodhya, why can’t it be taken out in Varanasi, questioned Singh mentioning that the next date for carrying out the Yatra in Varanasi will be announced soon. He alleged that the AAP supporters from neighbouring city were stopped from coming to the city for yatra. The spokesman claimed that many senior leaders and activists of the party had been issued notices and police did not allow them to leave their homes. He alleged that the party’s banners and posters were also removed from the yatra route by the police. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, Reasons for not permitting the AAP event in the city had been cleared to the party leaders. Despite this fact the MP was rigid to enter the city for carrying out yatra due to which he was stopped on airport road. Party workers, who started protesting, had been sent to police lines and were later released on personal bonds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/aap-mp-stopped-from-entering-city-permission-denied-for-tiranga-yatra/articleshow/87193114.cms||---

Jantar Singh, who was in his early 70s, had suffered a gunshot wound during the Behmai massacre case in which 21 people, mostly Thakurs, were shot dead by bandit queen Phoolan Devi and her gang on February 14, 1981. “Jantar Singh was seriously ill and was admitted at SGPGIMS, Lucknow for treatment where he breathed his last on Thursday morning. His 40-year wait for the court verdict in the case has also ended,” said district government counsel Raju Porwal, who is conducting the Behmai trial. Porwal added, “After complainant Rajaram’s death, Jantar Singh was doing the ‘pairvi’ of the case. However, his death would not make any impact on the case as his evidence had already been recorded by the court.” On February 14,1981, Behmai village had shot into world limelight when Phoolan Devi and her gang had raided the village situated on the bank of river Yamuna to take revenge for her humiliation and murder of her paramour Vikram Mallah. The gang had killed around 21 villagers of Thakur community in the raid. A couple of villagers had also been injured.” Witness Jantar Singh had also suffered gunshot injury but had survived and was the main witness of the prosecution. “Rajaram, a villager of the same village, had lodged an FIR of the case. Rajaram used to do ‘pairvi’ in this case. After his death, Jantar Singh was doing ‘pairvi’ of the case and used to reach court on every fixed date,” Porwal said, adding, “Recently, Jantar Singh, who was a retired fourth class employee of Bhognipur tehsil, had missed some dates due to health reason. He was admitted to SGPGI this week due to some prolonged illness.” “Around half a dozen alleged dacoits, including the main accused Phoolan Devi, have died and cases against them have been abated. One of the alleged dacoits, Posa, is in jail while accused Shaym Babu, Vishwanath and Bheekha are on bail. The case had twice reached the stage of final verdict, but judgment could not be delivered due to a technicality. Before delivering the judgement, the court had summoned the original case diary from the prosecution, but it was found to be missing,” Porwal told TOI. Porwal said, “Though the original case diary was not traceable, a Xerox copy was on record.” “Meanwhile, the presiding officer of the anti-dacoity court was transferred. Now, as per law and rules, the new presiding officer will have to hear the fresh arguments of the case. The arguments will likely commence soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/behmai-massacre-case-material-witness-dies-awaiting-justice/articleshow/87193120.cms||Anant Shekher Misra

Fortunately, none suffered injuries but a farmer working in the fields fainted out of panic on witnessing the fuel tanks falling from the sky after a loud thundering sound. Locals of Raghakapura village were awestruck when they found a villager lying unconscious and fuel tanks near him in a field.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Calls for policy as couple vaccinated in US gets railway passes on medical grounds||MUMBAI: Hours after TOI reported that a senior citizen couple vaccinated in the US was being denied railway passes, the authorities swung into action and handed them the passes on medical grounds. A relieved Angela Fernandes, 65, and her husband Cajetan, 71, went to Borivli station booking office on Thursday afternoon, paid and collected the passes. The couple had got the Moderna vaccine in January this year in California. They had gone there to meet their son in February 2020, but got stuck as the pandemic raged. Thanking TOI, Angela said: “In the morning around 9am, we received a call from a senior railway officer who enquired about the matter in detail. He asked us what would be a convenient time for us to go to the station and said he would accordingly speak to the station officer concerned to issue us passes. The officer later even called me to ask if the issue had been resolved.” The couple, residents of IC Colony in Borivli, needed railway passes to travel to a hospital in Wadala regularly for treatment. The railways has not started issuing daily tickets, and the couple was being denied passes as their vaccination status does not show on CoWIN. Chief public relations officer (CPRO) of Western Railway Sumit Thakur said: “It was a genuine issue and therefore we have issued them passes on medical grounds,” he said. Currently, there is no provision for the authorities to recognise a vaccine taken outside the country. Several politicians said many such cases are likely to come to light in future and a policy decision is needed soon. “The issue must be looked into seriously. There could be many others who are facing the same issue and are unable to voice it,” said Clyde Crasto, NCP spokesperson, Mumbai. Abhishek Ghosalkar, a former corporator from the Fernandes’s BMC ward, said he was happy the elderly couple could be helped instantly. “However, it would be better if some mechanism is devised so that all those who have taken Covid vaccine in other countries are considered vaccinated on showing the relevant document. With restrictions having eased across the country, we should allow everyone to move around according to their need,” said Ghosalkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-calls-for-policy-as-couple-vaccinated-in-us-gets-rly-passes-on-med-grounds/articleshow/87194853.cms||Richa Pinto

The gang robbed cash and gold totally worth Rs1.83 crore after threatening the bank manager and cashier. The suspects reached the bank in a blue-coloured sedan and drove away towards Ahmednagar after collecting the booty, officers from the Pune rural police said. The loot included Rs33 lakh in cash, and gold so far assessed at Rs1.50 crore. The bank officials were still in the process of assessing the robbed gold, which may push up the value of the loot, police said. One of the gang members waited in the car while the others proceeded towards the bank. One of them stood at the entrance while the other four moved in to collect the booty, police said citing evidence collected through CCTV footage. Five staffers had reported for duty on Thursday. Three of them were on lunch break, with only the manager and the cashier inside when the dacoits came, police added. Late on Thursday evening, bank cashier Sagar Panmand lodged a complaint with the Shirur police and a case under Section 395 (dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code was registered. Superintendent of Pune Rural police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI, “The gang executed the dacoity in 30 minutes. All five men who approached the bank were wearing hoodies and masks. Two of them were carrying pistols. Four men walked inside and threatened the bank manager and the cashier, asking them to remove all cash and gold from the safes.” Deshmukh said the manager and the cashier did not resist the armed intruders as they were held at gunpoint. “The intruders collected the cash and gold and walked out of the bank,” said Deshmukh. Deshmukh said the bank does not have a guard and that there was security alarm. However, the officials were so frightened that they failed to press the alarm bell button. “Going by the circumstances, we suspect the armed men may have conducted a recce of the bank premises before committing the dacoity. They chose a time when the bank does not have customers and bank staffers go out to have lunch,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/armed-masked-gang-of-6-robs-cash-gold-worth-rs-rs-1-8cr-from-bank-in-shirur/articleshow/87193123.cms||---

---||Agra||Dalit man who died in custody given electric shocks, tortured by cops: Kin||Agra: The family of Arun Valmiki, a Dalit sanitation worker who allegedly died in police custody, has accused cops of torturing him during interrogation by giving him electric shocks and tying his hands and feet. “He was beaten up mercilessly in front of his wife,” family members said on Thursday. Dismissing statements from police that Valmiki died due to heart attack, his mother, 70-year-old Kamla Devi, said cops were "lying" about the circumstances leading to the death of her son. "He died at the police station and not after the raid at our house, as claimed by some senior cops," she said. "Police raided our house on Monday, which was a day before Arun’s arrest. Their claim that they conducted the raid on Tuesday is false.” Police had on Wednesday said that of the Rs 25 lakh allegedly stolen by Valmiki from the Jagdishpura thana's malkhana, Rs 15 lakh was recovered from his house during the raid. Kamla Devi rubbished this, too. "Contrary to what the police are saying, no money was recovered from our house and everything was planned to frame my innocent son," she said, adding that other members of her family were also picked up by police and questioned for hours. "My son was not suffering from any ailment, but died due to the brutality meted out to him," she said, demanding justice for him and his three surviving children. Senior superintendent of police Muniraj G reiterated that the cause of death was a heart attack. He cited an autopsy report. On being asked about injuries on Valmiki's body, he said they could be old scars. “No serious injuries were found on vital parts of the body,” the SSP said. ADG Rajeev Krishna told TOI that all allegations of the family will be addressed during the investigation. He said that a probe by police officials from outside Agra has been ordered. Valmiki's wife Sonam said, “I was preparing for Karva Chauth, which is on October 24. Now what will I do? He used to bring home Rs 700 every month after cleaning the police station." Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was stopped for a short while en route to Agra on Wednesday by the police, visited Valmiki's family on Wednesday night and assured them all assistance. Priyanka claimed Valmiki's s family members told her that 18 more people from the community were picked up by cops on Sunday and were beaten up at the police station. "It's unbelievable and surprising that such brutality has taken place in independent India. The law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh is out of control," she said and added that the post-mortem report has not been given to the dead man's family. “No family member was present during Arun’s autopsy,” she said. State vice president of the party Upendra Kumar said that Priyanka has assured Rs 30 lakh in financial assistance to the family A case of murder has been registered against “unidentified police personnel”. Five cops, including the police chowki in-charge and an inspector of the crime branch, were suspended on Wednesday. Earlier, after the theft was first reported, six cops had been suspended for “negligence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dalit-man-who-died-in-custody-given-electric-shocks-tortured-by-cops-kin/articleshow/87191993.cms||---

I will remain in the SP till the time Mulayam is there.” The SP MP, on the occasion of the birth centenary of his father and former MP late Chaudhary Harmohan Singh Yadav, recently launched a poster carrying pictures of both Mulayam and the CM. For the past few days, rumours were doing the rounds that Sukhram and his son Mohit Yadav may join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On being questioned by the media, Sukhram praised the CM for his work, but said that “as long as Mulayam Singh is there, I am with the Samajwadi Party.” Three days ago an event was organised on the birth centenary of Chaudhary Harmohan at the latter’s residence in Meharban Singh Ka Purwa, Kanpur. Leaders of both the SP and BJP were present on this occasion. A poster depicting pictures of Mulayam and the CM, raised prior to the event created a confusion among the people and apparently in the respective parties of both the leaders. Sukhram said that it’s a mark of love and respect he has for both these senior leaders. “BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh is a simple man. My proximity with him is quite old. If people like him stay in BJP, then BJP’s stature will surely increase. Son Mohit Yadav has now become an adult. Any decision he takes, will be solely his.” He, however, also revealed the pain of his neglect in the SP in front of everyone. He said that things are changing gradually in politics. Without taking anybody’s name Sukhram said, “There are some people who are arrogant, and who are full of ego. I won’t say much about them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sukhram-clears-the-air-on-postercarrying-mulayam-cm-pictures/articleshow/87193141.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Goa||Seafarers’ body seeksanother CDC relaxation||Quepem: The director general of shipping has turned down Goan Seaman Association of India’s (GSAI) request to withdraw the order debarring a few seafarers from applying for the Indian Continuous Discharge Certificates (CDC) and to instead relax this period by two years. The seamen had been earlier debarred for life by DG shipping for the offence of submitting fake certificates for obtaining the CDC. However, after receiving various representations from candidates and associations, DG shipping had reduced the punishment period to three years. Following the request to further reduce the punishment period by a year, DG shipping, in a letter dated October 13, 2021, to the secretary of ministry of ports and shipping, stated that no further relaxation is desirable in this case as it is in response to the offence of submitting false certificates. GSAI president Frank Viegas said they have approached minister of state for shipping Shripad Naik with the request since most of the seafarers who applied in 2019 will have to wait for one more year. “Our seafarers are already jobless for almost two years due to the pandemic. It is a matter of their livelihood.” Most of the shipping companies are insisting on Indian CDC as a mandatory document, whereas CDC is required even for visa application, visa renewal and upgradation of STCW courses . GSAI also pleaded with DG shipping’s Amitabh Kumar to relax the debarment period to one year as a best solution acceptable to seafarers who are jobless for the last several years for committing the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seafarers-body-seeksanother-cdc-relaxation/articleshow/87193143.cms||---

Those arrested were identified as Arun Kumar Dubey of Indira Nagar, Aniruddha Pandey of Hazratganj, Khalid Munawar Baig of Aliganj and Anurag Mishra of Vinay Khand in Gomti Nagar. The police recovered fake job/appointment letters, nine ATM cards, six mobile phones, a Vidhan Sabha entry pass, two four-wheelers and Rs 2387 in cash from them. “Arun is director of a company named as Krishi Kumbh Private Limited, while the rest of the miscreants work as ‘hunters’ in the gang and they used to trap victims. Arun, who is the leader of the gang, formed companies like Krishi Kumbh, Motherhood Care and other NGOs and through these firms he received huge sums from innocent people to provide jobs in government departments,” said ASP, STF, Vishal Vikram Singh. Arun confessed that he was an old timer in the world of crime of fraud and was sent to jail in 2015 for theft of computer and other gadgets while serving as manager at a company in Aliganj.

The disaster has once again brought to light the effects of rampant quarrying in ecologically sensitive areas. Take for instance the case of a quarry at ward 6 in Kootickal panchayat. The historical satellite images preserved by Google Earth show that the quarry was relatively green while mining activities were at a smaller scale in February 2010. The patch of rocky land was surrounded by thick vegetation and shrubs or trees grew on the difficult terrain. Fast forward to 2015, the area is almost unrecognizable with mining taking off. Though closed down in 2018, the spot has lost its green cover and what is left is a huge rocky pit. Rajani Sudheer, member of ward-6, barely escaped the landslide this time. Overall, 12 landslides had struck her ward claiming the life of one person, she said. Ward 7, lying three kilometres away, also experienced considerable destruction, resulting from landslides. “Five bridges and two foot-bridges were damaged. Altogether, nearly 20 big and small landslides happened in my ward,” said Vinod KN, panchayat member. To make things worse, there is another smaller quarry, operating barely one km away from the first one, again in ward six. “There was a huge public protest against quarrying, but somehow they managed to quell it,” said Sebin PR a local resident of Vallientha in Koottickal. “Last year too three or four landslides had taken place in Kodunga. And in 2018, there were four or five,” he said. VS Vijayan, environmentalist and former chairman, Kerala Biodiversity Board, confirmed that quarries will result in landslides. “Quarrying is a major reason for landslides. What we should know is whether these quarries have necessary permits to operate or whether they are working without the knowledge of the authorities. The panel report chaired by ecologist Madhav Gadgil had classified eco-sensitive areas into three zones and all these places where landslides have happened fall under the most eco-sensitive zone-1,” he said. “No activity is allowed in zone-1 and with special permission, activity is allowed in zone-2. In zone-3, it is further relaxed,” Vijayan said. According to a 2019 study by the Kerala Forest Research Institute, there were 5,924 quarries operating in the state of which only 750 had permission from the department of mining and geology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sat-images-dont-lie-see-what-quarrying-did-to-koottickal/articleshow/87193157.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Agra||Dalit man who died in police custody in Agra given electric shock: Family||AGRA: The family of Arun Valmiki, a dalit sanitation worker who allegedly died in police custody, has accused cops of torturing him during interrogation by giving him electric shocks and tying his hands and feet. “He was beaten up mercilessly in front of his wife,” family members said on Thursday. Dismissing statements from police that Valmiki died due to heart attack, his mother, 70-year-old Kamla Devi, said cops were "lying" about the circumstances leading to the death of her son. "He died at the police station and not after the raid at our house, as claimed by some senior cops," she said. "Police raided our house on Monday, which was a day before Arun’s arrest. Their claim that they conducted the raid on Tuesday is false.” Police had on Wednesday said that of the Rs 25 lakh allegedly stolen by Valmiki from the Jagdishpura thana's malkhana, Rs 15 lakh was recovered from his house during the raid. Kamla Devi rubbished this, too. "Contrary to what the police are saying, no money was recovered from our house and everything was planned to frame my innocent son," she said, adding that other members of her family were also picked up by police and questioned for hours. "My son was not suffering from any ailment, but died due to the brutality meted out to him," she said, demanding justice for him and his three surviving children. Senior superintendent of police Muniraj G reiterated that the cause of death was a heart attack. He cited an autopsy report. On being asked about injuries on Valmiki's body, he said they could be old scars. “No serious injuries were found on vital parts of the body,” the SSP said. ADG Rajeev Krishna told TOI that all allegations of the family will be addressed during the investigation. He said that a probe by police officials from outside Agra has been ordered. Valmiki's wife Sonam said, “I was preparing for Karva Chauth, which is on October 24. Now what will I do? He used to bring home Rs 700 every month after cleaning the police station." Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was stopped for a short while en route to Agra on Wednesday by the police, visited Valmiki's family on Wednesday night and assured them all assistance. Priyanka claimed Valmiki's s family members told her that 18 more people from the community were picked up by cops on Sunday and were beaten up at the police station. "It's unbelievable and surprising that such brutality has taken place in independent India. The law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh is out of control," she said and added that the post-mortem report has not been given to the dead man's family. “No family member was present during Arun’s autopsy,” she said. State vice president of the party Upendra Kumar said that Priyanka has assured Rs 30 lakh in financial assistance to the family A case of murder has been registered against “unidentified police personnel”. Five cops, including the police chowki in-charge and an inspector of the crime branch, were suspended on Wednesday. Earlier, after the theft was first reported, six cops had been suspended for “negligence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dalit-man-who-died-in-custody-given-electric-shocks-tortured-by-cops-kin/articleshow/87192019.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kochi||Revised Kerala state action plan on climate change on the anvil||KOCHI: The directorate of environment and climate change has started to revise the Kerala state action plan on climate change. The old report was formulated in 2014 but the government failed to implement the recommendations in it despite a series of natural disasters plaguing the state that started with the drought in 2016.  The revised action plan will focus on the disaster vulnerability index of each district, each sector, adaptation and mitigation plans. Each district will be ranked based on the vulnerability index and what kind of disasters it stares at. The disasters happening in Kerala, vulnerability and the impact will be assessed based on the methodology used in the fifth assessment report of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The directorate started holding discussions with various stakeholders, including health, dam management authority and water resources, in the government sector. The draft of the revised plan is expected to be completed in four months and submitted to the state government, which should approve and implement the recommendations in it at the ground level. “We have taken all the eco system, including coastal, forest, rivers and biodiversity, into consideration for the action plan. Unlike the Gadgil committee report, which focused only on the conservation of Western Ghats, we look into an integrated approach. We hope it won’t face the same fate as the Gadgil report,” said an official in the directorate. The report will be prepared after examining all the disasters that happened in the state in the last 10 years.  In the health sector, population, density, air quality, quality of drinking water, industries, water bodies, how many vector borne diseases, how many die, number of hospitals, healthcare workers, availability of beds, ventilators and ICUs will be assessed in each sector and it will be analyzed whether each district can cope with any disaster. Experts in the field said there should be coordinated effort on the part of all stakeholders to implement the recommendations in the action plan. “It is shameful that human lives are lost in natural disasters at a time when revolution is happening in technology and artificial intelligence. The private sector is coming up with cutting-edge technology solutions and the government should tap that potential to address the climate change issues along with implementing the action plan in a concerted way,” said A Nambi Appadurai, director (climate resilience practice) World Resources Institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/revised-action-plan-on-climate-change-on-the-anvil/articleshow/87193177.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Subir Chaki family not convinced with cops’ robbery-gone-awry theory||KOLKATA: A day after a 42-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the murder of Kilburn Engineering MD Subir Chaki at his Kankulia Road house on Sunday evening, his family still can’t come to terms with his brutal end. Police said the motive was robbery and the murder was not planned. Chaki was killed as he recognized the woman’s son among the assailants, cops said. But the family refuses to be convinced that he and driver Robin Mondal were killed for a robbery gone awry. “We are watching so many theories and explanations being aired on TV and other media platforms but we are still clueless about what could have been the actual motive. Was it actually about something as trivial as looting his wallet and some cash or was there some other reason? We are waiting for an answer from police. We are clueless and are not in a state to react to this arrest at this moment,” said Chaki’s cousin Mainak. Probing Chaki and Mondal’s murders at the Kankulia Road house, which the former was trying to sell off, police on Tuesday arrested Mithu Haldar, a Diamond Harbour resident, for conspiring with her elder son, Vicky, the prime accused, and attempting to destroy evidence by washing Vicky’s blood-stained clothes. Vicky is yet to be arrested. So far, Mithu has told police her son and his friends posed as property agents and prospective buyers and had called Chaki over to the Kankulia Road house for “a discussion”. Vicky and his friends’ initial intension was to rob Chaki and had brought a knife along to threaten him, but they stabbed him and Mondal to death, after the executive recognised Vicky from an earlier visit, Mithu had told cops. “After the arrest, police have communicated with us only once. They showed us the woman’s photograph and asked us whether we knew her or not. His wife, mother and other family members told police none had ever seen the woman and that she was never employed by the family to work on any of their properties. We don’t know whether she had accompanied any labourers during the repairs of the house, but she was never employed there,” said Chaki. The family is yet to organize Chaki’s shradh as they waited for the family priest who arrived only on Thursday. A relative pointed out that the family was still so dazed and grief-stricken that they were yet to gather themselves and think of the rituals.  “Everyone is in a state of shock. They are not speaking to anyone and are mostly staying at their home. The conditions of Chaki’s mother and wife are particularly bad. His two children and son-in-law are here and they are managing all the rituals and formalities. It is painful to watch a jovial family break down to pieces like this. We all need some answers and hope cops can provide them to the family as early as possible,” said a family friend from Uniworld City, the New Town complex, where the family lives now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chaki-family-not-convinced-with-cops-robbery-gone-awry-theory/articleshow/87193252.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Goa||Vision document spells out plans for self-sufficiency in agriculture||Panaji: The vision document for Goa’s agriculture and allied sectors has emphasised on creating a value chain of supply network by post-harvest management and value addition. It has also stressed on crop diversification, intensification and integrated farming system approaches as well as advanced management practices to make the state self-sufficient in agriculture products. Vision for development of agriculture and allied sectors: A way towards making Goa self-reliant (Swayampurna Goa) prepared by the ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute suggested the establishment of model integrated farming system units in different regions of the state and making these popular through the directorate of agriculture. Under mechanisation in agriculture and allied activities, ICAR suggested developing or outsourcing the services through formation of squads for nutrient management, pest management (e.g. red palm weevil and rhizocerous beetle in coconut, cashew stem and root borer in cashew), coconut harvesting, artificial insemination, vaccination, etc by directorate of agriculture, animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) and fisheries department. For paddy crops, the vision document suggests establishing a community of agro-processing centres and promotion of storage structures by the directorate of agriculture (for subsidies and creation of machinery banks). For coconut cultivation, the document recommends setting up processing units for virgin coconut oil and other products as well as a coconut board for promotion. With regards to the cashew crop, the vision suggests cashew apple value-addition is needed, including development of feni as a by-product. The vision document stated that for other fruits/crops it was necessary to establish a community of multi-product processing plants for value-addition of kokum, jackfruit, breadfruit, jagoma (coffee plum), wax apple, jamun karonda (berry), star fruits, etc - through the ministry of food processing industries (MOFPI) and the Directorate of Agriculture for incentives and funding. Developing units for value addition in dairy milk products and pork and mutton products was recommended for dairy and meat products. Similarly, the vision document states that in the fishing sector there should be better availability of fish seeds, promotion of mussel farming, capacity building and awareness creation, etc. Further improved storage facilities – cold storage, cold ice plants, insulated vehicles, etc can also play an important role for marketing of the fish catch. Development of integrated farming systems with fishery as an important component to ensure regular income and improved production was also suggested. Post-harvest handling, value addition, allied activities like ornamental fish farming also have potential to contribute to improved incomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vision-document-spells-out-plans-for-self-sufficiency-in-agriculture/articleshow/87193197.cms||---
---||Delhi||Farm fire’s share in Delhi’s PM2.5 at season high of 15% and rising||NEW DELHI: Even as the proportion of harvest remnant burning in the respirable pollutants in Delhi’s air rose to 15% on Thursday, local winds dispersed the pollutants enough for the city AQI to marginally improve to 198 (high 'moderate') from the 'poor' 221 on Wednesday. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, the fire count in the neighbouring states reached 1,234 on Thursday, adding more PM2.5 pollutants to the air. However, as V K Soni of the environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department, explained, “The air quality improved on Thursday due to high wind speed in Delhi. The wind speed recorded during the day was 10-16 kmph and this facilitated the dispersion of pollutants.” SAFAR said, “Delhi’s AQI on Thursday was in the moderate category. As per our methodology, the effective fire counts are 1,234 and their share in Delhi’s PM2.5 is 15% as transport level winds are favourable for intrusion. However, local winds are moderate and this enhances the dispersion of pollutants keeping the AQI in the moderate category.” SAFAR, however, added, “Due to local dry weather and north-westerly winds, the local dust emission causes an increase of PM10. Additional dust from desert areas is very likely. The overall AQI is likely to degrade to poor in the next two days.” However, if the wind direction changes on Friday, the air quality of Delhi may improve instead. There is the possibility of a change in direction to west-south-westerly on Friday and southerly on October 23. With such a wind direction, the impact of stubble burning would be minimal. Also, light rain is predicted on October 24 which can help clean the air. “The improvement of the air will depend on the duration and amount of rainfall on October 24,” added Soni. According to experts, though farm fires are increasing, the peak is only around end-October and early November when the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 is certain to spike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-fires-share-in-delhis-pm2-5-at-season-high-of-15-and-rising/articleshow/87193194.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said that 2 lakh sqm would be transferred, but now it has issued a notification allotting 4 lakh sqm instead, he said. “I want the government to come clear on this issue. It should have taken farmers into confidence before taking any decision,” Gaonkar said. He said that out of 14 lakh sqm land belonging to SSSKL, during the assembly, the chief minister had said that 2 lakh sqm would be handed over to set up NFSU. “The chief minister says something in the assembly and the next day we get a letter issued by the deputy collector for transfer of 4 lakh sqm land,” he said. The government is playing with the emotions of sugarcane farmers, Gaonkar said, adding that the decision was taken unilaterally without calling a general body meeting. This way, in a few years, the government will hand over all the land belonging to the sugar factory for some other use, he said. Sawant on Tuesday had said that a detailed project report for setting up an ethanol production plant at SSSKL would be completed in 45 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-lied-on-land-transfer-to-forensic-univ-sanguem-mla/articleshow/87193225.cms||---

According to the health department, the number of dengue cases has been the highest since 2016. Doctors say prolonged monsoon is the reason for the rise as waterlogged areas have become an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. The hospitals are also flooded with dengue patients and in the medical college, the authorities have placed beds even outside the ward. According to the health department, the city reported 210 cases of dengue in 2016 followed by 660 in 2017 and 153 in 2018. In 2019, 207 dengue cases were reported in Meerut while in 2020, barely 35 cases of the disease spread by mosquito bites, were reported here. “This year, we received the first dengue patient for the ongoing season on August 18. Now, the cases have risen to 981,” said Dr Ashok Taliyan, divisional surveillance officer. Commenting on the reason for the spurt, the DSO said the weather is responsible for vector-borne disease which is common at this time of the year. “We try to clear the choked area where water stagnation exists, but the rains occur again. The excess moisture in the air is also a breeding ground for several insects that cause different diseases,” he added. The fever and dengue cases are such in the city that OPDs of almost every government and private hospital are flooded with patients. The doctors are also advising the patients not to take viral fever lightly and ensure that they take medication only after consulting them. “We are in touch with the civic body and continuous fogging is being done to ensure no larva breeding takes place in residential areas. All hospitals have been put on alert to tackle fever, dengue and malaria cases,” said chief medical officer, Meerut, Dr Akhilesh Mohan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dengue-cases-nears-1000-mark-in-meerut-highest-in-five-years/articleshow/87192090.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Nagpur||Will talk to senior Nagpur cops on growing crime: State HM Patil||Nagpur: Maharashtra home minister (HM) Dilip Walse-Patil on Friday said he would speak with senior Nagpur police officers about growing crime in the city, and brief the media after that. The state HM was at Deekshabhoomi on Friday, the second day of his three-day visit to Vidarbha. Patil said that ever since he became home minister of Maharashtra, he wanted to visit Deekshabhoomi and pay his tributes to Babasaheb Ambedkar in Nagpur. Lakhs of people have got inspiration from this historical place, he added. When asked by TOI what steps he would take to boost the morale of Maharashtra police, Patil said he would travel to every division of the state and meet senior police officials from each district. “I will review their work to understand their needs and issues so as to resolve them, and motivate police personnel to do better work. Today I will be interacting with police officers from Nagpur and on Saturday, I would meet cops from Amravati,” the state HM said. Patil did not wish to comment on the ongoing investigation in the Param Bir Singh matter as the inquiry committee was looking at it. “Unless and until its report comes out, I won’t be able to speak on that,” he said. When asked whether action would be taken against CBI director Subhod Jaiswal, Patil said a petition had come up in the high court (HC), so “let’s see what comes out of it”. Reacting to a question on HC asking the state government whether it would be filing a case against Rashmi Shukla in the phone-tapping case, he said the government would answer it in court. Patil said the misuse of central agencies was unfortunate. On NCP leader Nawab Malik “defending the Khan family” in the Aryan Khan case, the minister said that those are two separate issues and that Malik has got some issues with the functioning of an agency. Patil was accompanied by former MLA and NCP leader Prakash Gajbhiye, who has demanded that Nagpur be renamed after Ambedkar, as he took ‘deeksha’ along with a large number of followers at Deekshabhoomi in 1956. Gajbhiye reiterated his demand and said he would be submitting a memorandum to Patil in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-talk-to-senior-nagpur-cops-on-growing-crime-state-hm-patil/articleshow/87204129.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh
---||Goa||Infra projects for tribals in works with central funds||Margao: Various infrastructural projects in the state have received central government funds under schemes for tribal welfare, which are in various stages of completion. As per a reply tabled by the government in the recently-concluded assembly session to a question by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, work of demolition and reconstruction of the market complex at Banastari, Ponda, is in progress. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 17.8 crore which was sanctioned in the financial year 2017-18. 30% of the project work has been completed, the reply states. “Most of the scheduled tribe vendors selling their products in Banastari market will benefit from the new market complex which will be equipped with modern amenities,” tribal welfare minister Govind Gaude said in his reply. Work of erection of 11KV Aerial Bunched Conductor is in progress in the jurisdiction of Tivre-Orgao, Bhoma-Adcona and Betki-Khandola panchayats. The reply states that 10% of the work has been completed. The project estimated to cost Rs 6.3 crore was sanctioned in 2017-18. Work of conversion of overhead 11KV line to 11KV insulated conductor in the jurisdiction of Veling, Priol, Cuncoliem and Querim panchayats under the Tribal Sub Plan has already been completed at a cost of Rs 10.5 crore. The project was sanctioned in 2018-19 and 2019-20. Incidentally, all these works are located in Priol constituency represented by Gaude. “The Priol area in Ponda taluka is surrounded by small hills and has cluster of ST community located in a scattered manner. Presently, Priol constituency is fed electricity supply through single O/H 11KV line which was erected some years back. Due to ageing and saline climatic condition, the existing line at most of the places is in dilapidated condition. Due to this project, houses of ST community will get uninterrupted power supply,” Gaude’s reply states. Another project of construction of a new building for ITI at Mastimol, Canacona, to house newly started hospitality management trades, as also upgradation of existing six classrooms to digital ones is also likely to take off soon. The project is estimated to cost Rs 6.5 crore for which administrative approval has been obtained and tenders will be invited soon, the reply states. Significantly, the project lies in the home constituency of former Canacona MLA and former tribal welfare minister Ramesh Tawadkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/infra-projects-for-tribals-in-works-with-central-funds/articleshow/87193312.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Maur blast probe hushed up in Capt Amarinder Singh tenure: Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa||JALANDHAR: Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who also holds the charge of the home department, on Thursday leveled a serious allegation against former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, claiming that the investigation into the Maur blast case was hushed up during the former CM’s tenure and asked him to explain why the inquiry was halted. Just four days before the 2017 assembly polls, seven people were killed in the explosion in the Maur assembly segment. “We had asked him several times to speed up the inquiry as it was a big terror case but in place of speeding it up, the inquiry was hushed up,” said Randhawa while speaking to media persons on the sidelines of the Police Commemoration Day function at PAP Complex here. Randhawa was a cabinet minister in the Amarinder Singh government. “It was his failure as the home minister and he is answerable for that. Now he is talking a lot about internal security but I want to ask him that during his tenure there were several claims about busting terror modules but he should explain that why was the inquiry into the Maur blast halted. Why was the truth not brought before people,” he said, adding that the current Congress government would “now get the investigation re-started from the point where it was halted.” Randhawa once again highlighted that Amarinder had alleged a BSF-Pak Ranger nexus in 2016. “He was talking different things earlier and when he has been removed, he is saying something else and that reflects his double standards,” he said. “To fall at BJP’s feet is shameless,” the deputy CM quipped. Notably, it is for the first time that a minister of the Congress government has spoken up on the issue of the Maur blast, the biggest terror attack in the state in over a decade. Though there was initially a lot of noise and concern about the case, once it was traced to Sirsa dera in February 2018, the issue disappeared from political and police discourse on terrorism. Largely political parties and police have been maintaining silence about it. The blast was triggered when Congress candidate Harminder Jassi, a close relative of Sirsa dera chief, was leaving after addressing an election meeting on January 31, 2017. He had claimed that he was the target of the blast. The then Punjab DGP Suresh Arora had termed it a “targeted terrorist attack” and the then deputy CM and home minister Sukhbir Singh Badal had pinned the blame on AAP and Sikh radicals claiming that the blast was a result of hobnobbing between them. Captain Amarinder Singh had termed it a “senseless act of terrorism” while former Punjab DGP the late K P S Gill had also pointed a finger towards AAP and Sikh radicals for the blast. A special investigation team (SIT) led by then DIG Ranbir Singh Khattra had cracked the Maur blast case in February 2018 and traced it to Sirsa dera and even identified three suspects, who have already been declared proclaimed offenders. Khattra-led SIT got recorded statements of four witnesses before a magistrate who revealed that the car used in the terror act was painted and prepared in the workshop of Sirsa dera head where only the latter’s cars were modified or repaired. The SIT has already named three suspects in the case – all from the Dera, including in-charge of the workshop, dera head’s security guard, and an electrician there – and got them declared proclaimed offenders. The three identified accused include Gurtej Singh ’Kala’ of Alike village near Dabwali, Haryana; Amrik Singh of Bhikhi village in Mansa and Avtar Singh of Messi Majra village near Kurukshetra. There was little progress in the case after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/investigation-in-maur-blast-case-hushed-up-during-amarinders-tenure-randhawa/articleshow/87193241.cms||IP Singh

Again, the ongoing power crisis has already forced many companies there to cut production. In a rippling effect, the news has left Rajkot engineering sector worried as many automobile parts manufacturers here are highly dependent on imported steel. Rajkot is a hub of automobile parts. According to a rough estimate, Rajkot engineering sector consumes 30 percent imported steel, a major raw material for the automobile industry. “The automotive industry is also facing shortage of conductor chips and steel. These both are major raw materials.” said vice president of Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Parth Ganatra While China has asked other mills to ensure that production figures remains on par with that of previous year, the Rajkot engineering sector, which is already reeling under high raw material prices including steel, is bracing for more challenges with the new development. Paresh Vasani, president of Rajkot Engineering Association (REA), said, “On account of global shortage, Indian steel companies too have increased prices by 50 percent, thereby creating a survival issue for us. India produces 25 percent of total China’s steel production and under the new agenda to reduce steel production, the worst hit will be automobile sector which is the biggest consumer of steel.” There are two main branches of engineering casting and forging and both are used in the automobile industry. Rajkot’s engineering industry also tries to get orders from defence sector and the railways which require high grade steel. Around 5,000 tonne cast iron steel is used in a month for casting which is supplied by domestic companies, while imported steel is used for many parts of forging. “Indian steel companies are raising prices to take advantage of the international market. We need high grade steel to compete in the global market and have no option but to import steel,” said an industrialist, who did not wish to be identified. Besides being used in making irrigation machinery for agriculture sector and tractors, steel is also used in chassis, wheel rims, radiators and many other components of automobiles. “Imported steel is used in many applications of automobiles, like chain of motorcycles,” said Divyesh Aghera an engineering industrialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/china-cuts-steel-output-rajkot-industry-affected/articleshow/87192112.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

According to authorities, these units were moved into the rural belt of Baghpat and were quietly operating inside homes taken on rent. "As of now, we have sealed four units and procedure is on to seal the rest, too. The activity had tacit approval of the locals which is why we could never detect it earlier, but we got a reliable tip-off a couple of days ago after which I roped in pollution department and police teams for a surprise raid," said sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Baghpat, Anubhav Singh. The authorities also recovered three vehicles carrying thousands of jeans during a raid. A large quantity of chemical containers for colouring were also found. The managers of all these units are on the run. Singh added, "A single unit comprises at least three large mixers and one big dryer. Each of these units had installed a submersible pump as dyeing requires a huge amount of water. The worst part is that the untreated chemical waste was being thrown into drains and open areas due to which groundwater was being contaminated. According to our estimate, at least 50,000 jeans were being processed here every month and would find their way into the Delhi-NCR markets." Prakhar Katiyar, Baghpat Pollution Control Board official, said, "We are in the process of sealing all the units. Culprits are being identified after which administrative action will be taken against them, including filing of case and penalty."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/moved-from-delhi-ncr-during-lockdown-15-illegal-dyeing-units-sealed-in-baghpat-for-contaminating-groundwater/articleshow/87192119.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Mithu and sons abducted him, claims husband||Kolkata: The murders of Subir Chaki and his driver, Robin Mondal, might not be the only crime in which Mithu Haldar and her two sons have been involved. Cops from the Diamond Harbour district police, in coordination with Kolkata Police, are probing the trio’s antecedents to investigate their links with any other crime in South 24 Parganas and beyond. Mithu’s estranged husband Subhas described her as sinister and being capable of committing “crimes more heinous than the twin murders”. Though Mithu was not present at the crime spot, he said, he was sure she had planned it. Mithu’s police custody was sought for her involvement in the planning, conspiracy and commissioning of the murders. Subhas, an electrician, now lives in Kasba, far from Mithu and their sons, who had reportedly tried to kill him last year. Subhas claimed the three abducted him, gagged him and tied him to the bed at Mithu’s Bhagawanpur home in Diamond Harbour Municipality area. They then locked the house and left him for dead, he claimed. “Had it not been for the neighbours, who heard the noise of my struggle and rescued me, I would have been dead,” Subhas said. The three were arrested. Subhas claimed Chaki and his driver would have been alive had Mithu and her sons not been released on bail. After the release, Mithu had changed house thrice, introducing herself as a widow to the landlord or landlady. She had even told a landlady that she did not have any child. “She mostly lived alone and at times, introduced her visiting sons as nephews. Her elder son Vicky lived in Kolkata and the younger son, Vishal, lived with his maternal uncle and grandmother,” said Mithu’s current landlady, Pampa Gayen. It was Gayen who had spotted Mithu washing the blood-soaked clothes and asked her about it. Mithu had claimed the shirt belonged to her son, who was injured in a drunken brawl. “It was the first time she told me she had a son,” said Gayen. Sources also said Mithu worked as a caregiver as that would allow her access to the homes of elderly people of well-off families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mithu-and-sons-abducted-him-claims-husband/articleshow/87193354.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the decision was against the spirit of the constitution that gave due importance to state languages as well as federal principles under which all state languages had been given prime importance in their respective states. “By reducing Punjabi to a minor language, the CBSE is not only doing a disservice to the language, but also depriving students of the state the opportunity to take it up as a major subject,” he added. The Akali leader further added that the CBSE should take note of the Punjab Language Act that had made Punjabi a mandatory subject. “The CBSE should not do anything that dilutes the position of Punjabi as a state language in Punjab. This decision also sends out a signal that the Centre is trying to wean students away from their mother tongue,” said Cheema adding, this impression should be corrected immediately by reviewing the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-asks-cbse-to-take-back-decision-to-make-punjabi-a-minor-subject/articleshow/87193268.cms||---

However, the two to three percent farmers who have changed their crop this year will get the compensation after verification of the crop, he said. Following the closure of the factory, the state had assured to pay the farmers compensation for the next five years and the All Goa Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association, through its meeting held on August 31, had demanded that the government should consider the highest quantity of cane supplied by them to the factory while calculating the compensation. The farmers had supplied 47,069 tonne during the crushing season 2017-18, which was the highest quantity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-sanctions-balance-payout-to-cane-farmers/articleshow/87193255.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: NHAI project director among 3 removed over flyover span collapse||NAGPUR: Stung by the collapse of 30-metre superstructure of Kalamna bridge, which is part of the Pardi flyover, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Thursday removed NL Yeotkar, project director of project implementation unit (PIU-I), and two others. The work of Pardi Flyover is being executed by a joint venture of Gannon Dunkerley & Company Limited (GDCL) and SMS Infrastructure Limited. On the night of October 19, a 30-metre segment (superstructure) of a flyover from Kalamna to HB Town slipped from the Pier P7 and fell on the ground, causing a huge loss and bringing traffic to a grinding halt. NHAI regional officer (RO) Rajeev Agrawal confirmed to TOI that Yeotkar, who was in-charge of Pardi flyover project, has been shifted to regional office at Civil Lines. He will be replaced by Naresh Wadetwar, who is general manager (technical). To maintain transparency in the inquiry, Yeotkar has been shifted for an indefinite period. Agrawal said, “Similarly, Vijay Ahire, who was working as project manager with contractor GDCL, Mumbai, has been debarred for one year with immediate effect.” GDCL, which constructed the Kalamna bridge and is working on other Pardi flyovers, is known to be one of the expert agencies in bridges. Agrawal said, “We have also suspended team leader of LASA, Vipul Chakravarty, working on the Pardi flyover project.” LASA was involved in designs of the flyover which included bearings designs too. The top NHAI officer said the action is at the regional level against those who have been prima facie found responsible for the incident. “The NHAI will take more stringent action once the three-member high-level committee submits its report,” said Agrawal. Agrawal said on Wednesday, Alok Kumar, member (administration), NHAI, Delhi, had visited the site and issued directions. On Thursday, Vinay Gupta, director of Tandon Consultants, one of the well-known firms in construction of bridges, also visited the site. He will be one of the members of the high-level committee that will probe the incident. Sources said another member from Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), a constituent laboratory of India’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), will conduct a site visit soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nhai-project-director-among-3-removed-over-flyover-span-collapse/articleshow/87193257.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Kangana Ranaut’s petition to shift case is rejected||MUMBAI: An additional chief metropolitan magistrate on Thursday rejected a plea made by actor Kangana Ranaut for transfer of veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar’s defamation complaint against her to another magistrate. Last month Ranaut’s lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, moved a plea seeking a transfer of the case from the in-charge court on the grounds that she has “lost faith” in it. He said they were “not comfortable” before the court and felt it was “biased against her.” Siddiquee said they will challenge Thursday’s order. Akhtar had filed the defamation complaint against Ranaut in November 2020 before the Andheri magistrate’s court. Akhtar’s plea had said he was shocked when he learnt on July 19, 2020, that Ranaut had given an interview to Arnab Goswami of Republic TV and Republic Bharat, damaging his “immaculate reputation by falsely attributing statements to him”. Ranaut appeared before the in-charge court last month after the court repeatedly summoned her. On Wednesday in his arguments for the transfer, Siddiquee submitted that the Andheri court magistrate had all the powers to decide on applications which were before him for adjudication, however he allegedly summoned her and chose to say he may issue an arrest warrant without giving any sufficient cause and reasons in writing. Akhtar’s advocate Jay Bharadwaj seeking dismissal of her plea said it is not maintainable and lacking in any legal basis. He said she was not present on several occasions and her plea could not be recorded after cognizance was taken by the Magistrate. Bharadwaj said Akhtar, being a senior citizen, has been diligently present on each and every date of hearing. Ranaut has also filed a case against Akhtar. In her complaint, Ranaut has accused him of extortion and criminal intimidation among other charges. She alleged that in a public dispute with Hrithik Roshan, Akhtar called her sister and her to his Juhu house, and threatened and forced her to tender a written apology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kanganas-petition-to-shift-case-is-rejected/articleshow/87193281.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: 250 city buses stay off roads, commuters face tough time||JAIPUR: Over 2 lakh people have a tough time on Thursday following strike by employees of Jaipur City Transport Service Limited (JCTSL). More than 250 JCTSL buses remained at depots which led to revenue loss of Rs 25 lakh for the transport department. JCTSL bus service is considered to be the lifeline of the city. As the strike will continue on Friday, people will have to depend on private buses, auto and cabs. Manoj Sharma, waiting for a private bus at Nayaran Singh Circle said, “I have to take private bus that are very crowded today. Private buses have increased the fare by Rs 5 for some stops as well. I really hope that the strike ends soon.” Some people were seen taking autos in sharing for long distance or taking autos till their offices. Not everyone is able to afford the cab services as well. A university student, in front of Maharaja College who travels from Bassi every day said that private bus operators were not accepting their students’ identity card for concession as well. A group of officials went to meet the employees sitting on a strike at Vidhyadhar Nagar depot on Thursday, but no concrete solution was released. TOI tried to contact OSD for JCTSL Ashok Sharma, but he didn’t respond. Around 1,115 JCTSL employees have declared strike to get their demands fulfilled by the government. Employees said they haven’t received their arrears which is around Rs 15 crore and seventh Pay Commission recommendations have not been implemented. They are also demanding for regularisation of employees who were hired eight years back but still working on probation. JCTSL Employees Union member, Babulal said, “Our OSD Ashok Sharma and other officials came to meet us but we have refused to resume work until we get every assurance in writing. There is a list of demands we have given to the higher authorities and they must accept it before making blame for any inconvenience public is facing.” On Wednesday, department issued orders that the strike will not be considered as valid and anyone going on strike will be dealt with strictness. However, no action was taken against the employees on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/250-city-buses-stay-off-roads-commuters-face-tough-time/articleshow/87193279.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Underground cables can’t be provided everywhere’||Panaji: While admitting that the state’s power supply infrastructure is “bad”, power minister Nilesh Cabral said his ministry is looking at setting up new infrastructure having utility value of 30-40 years, with a focus on upgrading distribution networks and providing underground cabling of 11kV and 33kV in some areas. He, however, said an underground cabling system cannot be provided everywhere because it has its own limitations of drawing electricity, and also because of the costs involved. His ministry has instead proposed high-temperature, low sag (HTLS) conductors for some areas. Conductors employing this technology can take three times more load than a normal conductor. “Our infrastructure is bad. No sooner was I made power minister than I submitted estimates for upgrades to then chief minister Manohar Parrikar. But shortly after that, he took ill. Despite chief minister Pramod Sawant’s cooperation, a second setback surfaced in the form of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. “Nevertheless, insulators of all bigger lines have been changed and underground cabling, so far, has been done for smaller areas such as Porvorim. However, underground cabling in places like the Candolim belt, for instance, can’t be done because we cannot lay bigger cables. For such areas, we have proposed HTLS conductors,” Cabral said. “Our main aim is to give uninterrupted power supply to all consumers.” The minister said that although the electricity department had begun work on upgrading infrastructure two years ago, much time was wasted due to the pandemic. The department’s most harrowing time, he said, was when cyclone Tauktae hit Goa in May, causing power outages for more than three days in many areas and prompting the electricity department to source contractors from outside the state to help restore supply at the earliest. “Tendering processes for better infrastructure have begun but will take time. After the pandemic, rates have gone up by 30-40%. It is not because of me or my department, but we will see to it that work progresses,” he said. “||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/underground-cables-cant-be-provided-everywhere/articleshow/87193264.cms||---

The complainants approached Rajkot taluka police station on Thursday stating that they had invested in the firm lured by promises of good return. Complainant Jenti Patel told the police that he had gone to Dhananjay Finance Company’s office located at Nana Mauva six years ago and was lured by the temptation of getting 18 percent annual return. Patel said that he sold off his agricultural land in Paddadhri taluka and invested Rs 25 lakh with the firm and started getting good returns. Thereafter, he also convinced 17 of his relatives including his brother Vipul, brothers-in-law Kamlesh Ramoliya and Dinesh Fefar along with others to invest around Rs 4 crore in the scheme. Every investor got good returns till 2019, but after that the company closed down overnight after it lost all its money. The investors, meanwhile, came to know that three accused of the company, including chairman Asmita Pambhar and directors Ghanshyam Pambhar, Vallabh Pambhar are residents of Surat and approached Rajkot police to register a an FIR against them. According to the police, after analyzing all the documents, the three accused have been booked under IPC sections 406, 409, 420 and 120 (b), while cops have also started searching for other fraud victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/firm-dupes-17-of-rs-4-crore-in-fraud-scheme/articleshow/87192137.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fake insurance executive dupes banker of Rs 90,000 for ‘policy refund’||MUMBAI: City police have arrested a 28-year-old Thane resident for allegedly duping a 50-year-old employee of a nationalised bank of Rs 90,000 by promising to refund Rs 2.9 lakh she had invested in a life insurance policy. The accused’s WhatsApp chats reveal he had similarly contacted more than a hundred other policy holders of various insurance companies with refund offers, said the police. Cops warn that frauds involving surrender of insurance policies before the lock-in period ends are on the rise. Many in need of lumpsum funds fall victim to such scams. The accused, Suraj Waghmare, had allegedly called up the complainant posing as an employee of a well-known insurance company and had given a fake account number of the firm for depositing “processing fees”. The bank employee transferred Rs 90,000 in various transactions into the account till she realised she had been defrauded. The complainant approached D B Marg police on October 10 and lodged an FIR for cheating. Police also invoked sections of the IT Act. A team led by senior inspector Pradip Khude, PI Raja Bidkar, API Rajaram Pol, PSI Pradip Patil and staff members Suraj Dahigude and Rambhau Sangle began working on the case. The complainant told the police she had received a call from a person who introduced himself as an executive of an insurance firm from whom she had taken a policy. “Even though she had been regularly paying the premium, the caller told her they had not received the last installment. He then asked her if she was interested in surrendering her policy and getting a refund,” said a cop. The woman, who had a total of three policies, agreed. Based on the bank account number and his phone number, police arrested Waghmare, a resident of Wagle Estate, Thane. “A Mumbai court has remanded him in police custody,” said a cop. “Waghmare, who dropped out of school after SSC, had earlier worked in an insurance company for a year and knows how they function,” said a cop. In the chats, he pretended to be an executive of various insurance companies.

---||Delhi||Gopal Rai says it with roses, urges Delhi to fight air pollution||NEW DELHI: The MLAs of Delhi took to streets on Thursday to create awareness among people about the ongoing “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign. Environment minister Gopal Rai said the councillors of Delhi would run an awareness campaign at Barakhamba Road intersection on October 25. Rai, who visited the traffic signal at Chandgi Ram Akhara along with other MLAs, said the level of pollution had come down due to the rains as the stubble burning had stopped. However, with rains now over, the incidents of farm fires will increase, which will adversely affect Delhi, he added. “Our effort is to make people aware about pollution in Delhi. A public participation campaign is being carried out under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. The AAP MLAs have gathered to make people aware, but those of other parties have not joined us, despite being informed. The government is emphasising on public participation and running other campaigns, including the anti-dust campaign. Increasing participation of people in this fight will reduce their share in pollution,” said Rai, who also gave red roses to people requesting them to switch off their vehicles while waiting at signals. He said there would be a joint meeting with the SDMs and Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Friday. “This campaign will be taken to the mohalla level. Based on the decision taken at the meeting, we will take scale the campaign to a higher level.” Rai said the pollution caused due to stubble burning could not be reduced by applying GRAP. “We talked to the Centre and the state government about solution to stubble burning, but there has been gross negligence on their part. If bio-decomposer were sprayed responsibly, the farmers would not be forced to burn stubble,” claimed the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-says-it-with-roses-urges-city-to-fight-air-pollution/articleshow/87193292.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Jawaharnagar dump yard reeking havoc||HYDERABAD: Unable to bear the foul stench emanating from the Jawaharnagar dump yard, people living in several localities adjoining the area reached out to authorities. This, as the pungent stench has forced people to stay indoors. A probe was later ordered by municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao. A visit to the colonies located in six to seven kilometres radius of the dump yard revealed how difficult it has become for residents to go about their routine chores without covering themselves with a handkerchief. This, they say, is the only effective way to shield themselves from the brutal onslaught of stench and smoke. “We brought some land here and constructed a house believing the promises made by successive state governments. However, no concrete measures have been taken in the last eight years. The stench only gets worse every year,” complained R Shanti Kumar, a resident of Dammaiguda, which is six kilometres away from the dump yard. The foul smell starts to fill the air right from Alwal, Sainikpuri and Trimulgherry, as most garbage trucks pass through these areas to reach Jawaharnagar. Spread over 300 acres, the dump yard has been in active use for over a decade. Residents, however, lament that despite the capping and leachate treatment which was taken up recently, the stench accompanied by health issues have only compounded with every passing year. Not just the air, but over the years, the dump yard has also contaminated the ground water in the surrounding areas, residents said. “There are days when we wake up at night almost choking because of the strong stench that fills the air. We have been living here for nearly 20 years but were never consulted when the dumping started. Initially, it was just the air which was polluted but now, it is also the water,” said M Subashini, a resident of Nagaram. The issue has also gone viral on social media on Thursday when several residents and political functionaries asking authorities for their personal intervention in the matter. Many have sought for a permanent solution to the problem. Responding to the concerns, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao directed MA&UD special chief secretary Arvind Kumar, GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalaxmi and commissioner Lokesh Kumar to visit Jawaharnagar and submit a report on the issue. “We have spent Rs146 crore on capping the legacy dump and started 20MW waste to energy plant also. Also, sanctioned funds for leachate treatment. (sic),” KTR tweeted on the issue. GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar was not available for a response on the issue. Calls and messages from TOI went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jawaharnagar-dump-yard-reeking-havoc/articleshow/87193269.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Patna||Make Bihar a developed state by 2047: President Kovind to lawmakers||PATNA: President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday appealed to the legislators across the country, including those in Bihar, to adopt ethical behaviour and also change their “working style” to fulfil the developmental aspirations of the people. The President also fervently appealed to the lawmakers to transform Bihar into a “fully-developed state” on all counts of the human development index by 2047, the year when the country will celebrate the centenary of its Independence. Kovind was addressing a function on the premises of the Bihar state legislature to mark the centenary celebration of its building whose foundation was laid by viceroy Lord Hardinge in 1913 and the construction was completed in 1920. The first session of the state legislature, set up under the 1919 Government of India Act, comprising the council and the assembly, was held on February 7, 1921. “In the people of the country, including Bihar, there is the visible strong desire for a better future. It is my faith that you, the legislators, will try to materialise the aspirations of the people with your ethical behaviour and matching working style,” the President said. The President noted the mark Bihar has already left in the global cultural arena, especially in relation to the Chhath puja. “Chhath has become a truly global festival. It is celebrated on a huge scale from Nawada in Bihar to New Jersey in the US and from Begusarai to Boston. Similarly, Bihar will set new records in development complying with all the parameters.” In his brief address, Kovind also touched upon his love for Bihar and its reciprocation by the people of the state when he was the governor of the state, and, in course, had become the President. “I have inherited the rich legacy left by the country’s first President Dr Rajendra Prasad, who was from Bihar and also President Dr Zakir Hussain, who, too, had been the state’s governor. I have been trying to fulfil it,” he said. Kovind traced the growth of Bihar’s state system both in the pre and post-Independence period, saying that the state had been the birthplace of the world’s first republican state in Vaishali during the period of Lord Buddha. Accordingly, he referred to the presence of Buddhist ethos and inputs in the country’s Constitution. The function was also addressed by state assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, CM Nitish Kumar and governor Phagu Chauhan. Deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi were also on the stage. Around 1,000 present and former MLAs and MPs, as well as some Padma award winners were among the invitees. In tune with the theme for the occasion veering around the significance of debate in the legislative practice, governor Chauhan appealed to the lawmakers to hold debate before passing a Bill for enactment into law. Speaker Sinha said debate was fundamental to the legislative business and law-making exercise. Nitish presented a broad overview of the steps taken by his government for the promotion of Bihari identity by practicing inclusive developmental growth and cultural progress, including with regard to the Buddhist tradition and provision of infrastructural support at Bodh Gaya and Patna. The President said Nitish has followed the “egalitarian” model of growth by dint of which he had set the record of serving the state as its CM for the longest period in the post-Independence period. The President and those on the stage with him released a souvenir on the state assembly. Earlier, Kovind had laid foundation on the campus for the construction of a pillar to mark the centenary of the legislature building. Meanwhile, Nitish announced that a 15-day leave would be granted to the government employees and officials keen to sit on ‘Vipasana’ meditation for 10 days at Buddha Smriti Park in Patna. The Maharashtra government has also been providing 10-day leave to its officials and employees per year for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/make-bihar-a-developed-state-by-2047-president-to-lawmakers/articleshow/87192639.cms||Abhay Singh

The government had mandated this soon after the second wave of Covid-19 when oxygen shortage resulted in it being transported by rail and flights. “While oxygen cylinders and tanks do serve needs of patients, a sudden breakdown in supply or an erratic supply for a short period can be the difference between life and death. So, we decided to have oxygen generation plant within the premises,” said N Mohana Rao, an official from Kamineni Hospitals. “Recently, in the India Med Expo at Hitex Exhibition Centre, several hospitals and medical colleges from Telangana and AP approached us for installation of onsite PSA Oxygen plant. Most of the hospitals have a capacity of 25-plus beds,” said Siddharth Rastogi, executive director at MVS Engineering Pvt Ltd.

---||Hyderabad||Pvt Inter colleges to boycott exams||Hyderabad: Hours after education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy on Thursday made it clear that intermediate first year exams will be held from October 25, private inter college managements said they will boycott exams. They said the education minister and Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) officials are not even ready to discuss their issues. The members of the Telangana Private Junior Colleges Managements’ Association (TPJMA) said they have already submitted representations to the education minister, TSBIE secretary, DIEOS, and nodal officers, but the officials are not even ready to discuss their concerns. “This shows negligence attitude of the state and officials. Even after we said that we are going to boycott exams, neither the minister nor officials are even ready to discuss and assure that our concerns will be addressed,” said Satish G, president, TPJMA. He said that their intention is not to cause inconvenience to the board or students but to get their long-pending issues to be resolved. The management representatives said they are suffering because of pending scholarship amounts. While owners are unable to clear the pending rents and bills, staff are not getting their salaries as the state owes them about Rs 315 crore scholarship amount, which is pending for the last couple of years. TSBIE officials said that they are expecting managements will cooperate as their students also have to appear for the exams. However, TSBIE Syed Omer Jaleel, on Thursday confirmed that a few colleges have refused to receive examination material. “There are a total of 1,768 centres. Less than a dozen didn’t take material today (Thursday). Those who fail to report for examination duty by Friday will have to face action,” Jaleel told TOI. Sabitha Indra Reddy said about 4.58 lakh students will be appearing for these exams and added that it is the state’s responsibility to conduct exams on time. She also asked private junior college managements to cooperate in the conduct of examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-inter-colleges-to-boycott-exams/articleshow/87193209.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Jaipur||CM Ashok Gehlot: Fill vacant urban development and housing posts||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has asked the urban development and housing (UDH) officials to fill vacant posts by October 31 to expedite the work under the six-month Shahar-2021 campaign. The CM was speaking during a review meet of the ambitious campaign on Thursday. The CM will also visit the camps organised under 'Prashan Gaon Ke Sangh' campaign in Nagaur and Jaipur districts on Friday. The vacant posts appeared to be the reason for slow pace of work in the camps. The UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal apprised the CM of the powers delegated to the local bodies to outsource work. A senior official, who attended the meet, said, "The UDH minister will also hold talks with the collectors in the state. They will be directed to monitor the campaign and train local bodies to expedite the campaign." According to sources, soon after the Rajasthan High Court banned the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities that are not a part of the zonal development plan, the UDH has swung into action for its implementation. As per the mandatory rules, cities with more than 1 lakh population can only be regularised after the implementation of zonal development plan. For the same, the state government has to notify zonal development plans for 28 cities. An official said, "A deadline of December 15 has been set to implement the zonal plan in all major cities, including 150 local bodies. The suggestions and objections from the residents in 13 cities to implement zonal development plan has been incorporated." The state government has also disposed of the objections received on zonal plan in Alwar, Chittorgarh and Nagaur. The plan will be finalised soon. The state government recently launched the ambitious six-month special campaign, ‘Shahar-2021’ to issue lease deeds. However, the plan was stalled after Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday banned the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities without having zonal and sector plan. The government aimed to issue 10 lakh lease deeds during the campaign. The major attraction of the campaign was regularisation of colonies on agriculture land. It is estimated that about 7-8 lakh houses partially or fully constructed on agriculture land need title deeds. Sources said, "After the court order, the government cannot issue lease deeds on promised 70% plots."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fill-vacant-udh-posts-to-expedite-shahar21-gehlot/articleshow/87193308.cms||---
---||Lucknow||SBSP’s move brings focus on Rajbhar votes||Lucknow: Former BJP ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar’s move to lend “unconditional support” to the Samajwadi Party ahead of UP polls has put the focus on political churning around the Rajbhar community which holds sway in at least 60-80 assembly seats, mainly in eastern UP. The development has come amid speculations about BJP opening back channel negotiations with the SBSP chief who has been threatening to sabotage the ruling party’s prospects of returning to power in 2022. The move has also sounded alarm bells in the BSP camp which has been facing rebellion of senior leaders, including former national general secretary, Ram Achal Rajbhar, who has been openly hobnobbing with top SP ranks. A senior UP BJP leader confirmed to TOI that negotiations with OP Rajbhar had been initiated. Analysts said that BJP striking an alliance with Rajbhar has some political necessity for both parties, despite the saffron party’s move to prop fresh Rajbhar faces, including cabinet minister Anil Rajbhar and Rajya Sabha MP Sakal Deep Rajbhar. With deal sealed, the SBSP president has called a Mahapanchayat of backward, Dalit and minority community on October 27 in Mau where BSP chief Mayawati has replaced her party’s sitting MLA and jailed don Mukhtar Ansari with state president Bhim Rajbhar. BSP sources said that projection of Bhim Rajbhar will lend traction to the party's outreach to the community. On October 19, a day after the death of former Assembly Speaker Sukhdev Rajbhar, BSP chief Mayawati had tweeted a condolence message for his family even though he had parted ways with BSP in 2021 on not very positive note. A senior BSP member said that the party was unlikely to face any threat from SP, since both OP Rajbhar and Ram Achal Rajbhar, who had been with the BSP previously, do not get along. “Our assessment is that the Rajbhar community will vote for a Rajbhar candidate, irrespective of the party, as they would like the maximum number of people from their community to be in power. However, if both BSP and SP field Rajbhar candidates, then the vote will come to BSP since the community is aware of how much importance has been given to the people from the community,” a senior BSP leader said. Another BSP leader claimed that the party lost votes of the Rajbhar community because both Ram Achal and Om Prakash Rajbhar did nothing for the community while they were in the BSP. The SBSP chief, who had formed a Bhagidari Morcha of which BSP was a part in the Bihar elections, had been keeping everyone guessing about a possible alliance while he got in touch with a host of opposition parties, including Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) chief Shivpal Yadav. A senior SBSP functionary told TOI that the BJP leadership has been “seeking” its support “without any assurance” on conceding to the key demands. While Rajbhar could not be contacted, his son and party national general secretary Arun Rajbhar said they were not willing to fall in any trap of the BJP. BJP vice-president and in charge of OBC Morcha Daya Shankar Singh said that the party has been grooming its own Rajbhar leadership and was well prepared to face any challenges from the political adversaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sbsps-move-brings-focus-on-rajbhar-votes/articleshow/87194185.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Hyderabad||AQI takes turn for worse as monsoon effect wears off in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: With the monsoon season coming to an end, the air quality index (AQI) is now showing a downward trend in the city. As per Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) figures, the AQI, which remained below 100 throughout the monsoon in the satisfactory category, climbed back to 125 in the moderate category on Thursday. Prominent pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM 2.5 were relatively high across five of the six monitoring stations in the city. TSPCB figures indicates that AQI was below 100 until October 10 and started rising since October 11. On October 13, AQI at Zoo Park area touched 230, which falls in the poor category resulting in breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. “Rains wash off pollutants in the air, resulting in better air quality. Now that rainfall activity has subdued, air quality is slipping into the moderate category. Pollutants from vehicles and industries coupled with construction activities contribute to rising air pollution levels,” said a senior official from TSPCB. With Diwali around the corner, residents fear that air quality is only likely to get worse. “For a while when the lockdown was imposed, air quality levels were so much better. However, ever since the lockdown was eased, pollution levels have come back to normal. I hope it doesn’t worsen with Diwali firecrackers,” said Madhu Vinod, a resident of Kothaguda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aqi-takes-turn-for-worse-as-monsoon-effect-wears-off/articleshow/87193290.cms||---

The policies like increasing BSF jurisdiction area and removal of Punjabi indicated the politically-motivated vested interests of the BJP government, he alleged. The minister said the Modi government should immediately reconsider its decisions which were “contrary to the spirit of Indian Constitution”. He added that it was the bounden duty of every citizen to follow the rules and guidelines laid by the Indian Constitution but the Modi government had regularly been taking its decisions for their political benefits without taking proper notice of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/exclusion-of-punjabi-an-act-of-provocation-singla/articleshow/87193288.cms||---

Hajabba, the orange seller who saved money to build a school in his village, was declared the recipient of one of the highest civilian honours of India on January 25, 2020. Hajabba received a letter intimating that the certificate signed by the President will be presented to him in March, but the ceremony was delayed due to the pandemic. “I have been in touch with the office of the Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel to make necessary arrangements for my travel to New Delhi for the ceremony. The government will take care of all my expenses. I will be leaving on November 7. I will preserve this prestigious honour bestowed on me in my house along with other awards, mementos and certificates that I received from more than 500 organisations,” he said. Hajabba, 65, an illiterate fruit vendor who is popularly known as ‘Akshara Santa’ (Saint of Letters), was successful in building a school to educate children of his village in New Padpu, Harekala, located about 35 km from Mangaluru city. Deeply pained that he could not study as his village did not have a school, he took it up as a challenge and his journey towards building a school in Harekala began in 1995. He left no stone unturned to get land for the school and for approval from the education department. His dream turned into reality when Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat sanctioned a school in 1999. Initially, Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Lower Primary School popular as ‘Hajabba avara Shale’ (Hajabba’s school) was functioning in a mosque. Later, Hajabba built classrooms for the school on 40 cents of land sanctioned by the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/hajabba-all-set-to-receive-padma-shri-on-nov-8/articleshow/87191494.cms||---

---||Thane||Mumbai: Fake insurance executive dupes banker of Rs 90,000 for ‘policy refund’||MUMBAI: City police have arrested a 28-year-old Thane resident for allegedly duping a 50-year-old employee of a nationalised bank of Rs 90,000 by promising to refund Rs 2.9 lakh she had invested in a life insurance policy. The accused’s WhatsApp chats reveal he had similarly contacted more than a hundred other policy holders of various insurance companies with refund offers, said the police. Cops warn that frauds involving surrender of insurance policies before the lock-in period ends are on the rise. Many in need of lumpsum funds fall victim to such scams. The accused, Suraj Waghmare, had allegedly called up the complainant posing as an employee of a well-known insurance company and had given a fake account number of the firm for depositing “processing fees”. The bank employee transferred Rs 90,000 in various transactions into the account till she realised she had been defrauded. The complainant approached D B Marg police on October 10 and lodged an FIR for cheating. Police also invoked sections of the IT Act. A team led by senior inspector Pradip Khude, PI Raja Bidkar, API Rajaram Pol, PSI Pradip Patil and staff members Suraj Dahigude and Rambhau Sangle began working on the case. The complainant told the police she had received a call from a person who introduced himself as an executive of an insurance firm from whom she had taken a policy. “Even though she had been regularly paying the premium, the caller told her they had not received the last installment. He then asked her if she was interested in surrendering her policy and getting a refund,” said a cop. The woman, who had a total of three policies, agreed. Based on the bank account number and his phone number, police arrested Waghmare, a resident of Wagle Estate, Thane. “A Mumbai court has remanded him in police custody,” said a cop. “Waghmare, who dropped out of school after SSC, had earlier worked in an insurance company for a year and knows how they function,” said a cop. In the chats, he pretended to be an executive of various insurance companies. Police have found transactions of over Rs 7.5 lakh in his account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-fake-insurance-executive-dupes-banker-of-rs-90k-for-policy-refund/articleshow/87198186.cms||Mateen Hafeez

While vaccination has picked up in districts over the last few weeks, efforts are being made to reach the last-mile. As per official data, Narayanpet, Mulugu, Mancherial, Sircilla, Bhupalpally and Wanaparthy districts currently have least vaccine coverage. “District and even mandal level teams have been formed and we are addressing people in gram panchayats to encourage them to take vaccine. House-to-house campaigns are also planned in areas where we see low turnout,” said one district medical health officer (DMHO). Administration of first doses is now progressing in districts which had started the drive over the last three weeks. Earlier, state health department had focussed efforts on covering the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area which includes Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy districts, as the viral spread was primarily in these areas. With the drive now picking up in other districts, many beneficiaries who had been waiting for the vaccines are now turning up. “However, we are also encountering vaccine hesitancy and especially seeing a low turnout for second doses. Even state-wide, there are many who have long surpassed their scheduled date for second dose. We will be reaching out to common meeting points like markets and community functions to ensure that administration of first doses is completed by the end of the festive season,” said a senior health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-dept-branches-out-to-villages-to-boost-vax-coverage/articleshow/87193244.cms||Amrita Didyala

The last date for submitting applications by qualified candidates is October 28 following which the final selection list would be released by the DME on October 31 and selected candidates have to join by November 7. Considering the NMC team might visit these colleges in December, the DME has made it clear that selected candidates should not have appeared for NMC assessment on and after July 31, 2021, since the assessment is for the academic year 2021-22. Establishment of these colleges would add another 1,200 medical seats in the state. The DME officials were also focusing on establishing 12 departments, including cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology, in these new institutions. “We are also modifying the buildings as per NMC guidelines wherever required. The roads and buildings department is taking care of the college buildings,” Reddy added. The last date for submitting applications by qualified candidates is October 28 following which the final selection list will be released by DME on October 31 and selected candidates have to join by November 7||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-starts-process-to-set-up-eight-medical-colleges/articleshow/87193162.cms||---

Interacting with the officials of the health department through a video conference on Thursday, Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said that those yet to receive the second dose of the vaccine must be considered over those who were to receive the first dose. “Administer the vaccine to all those aged over 18, and ensure the Lasika Mela is a success. We need to be very cautious to prevent a third wave of the pandemic. We need to ramp up testing and Covid–19 protocol strictly enforced,” Rajendra said. As many as 67,000 doses of the vaccine will be stocked in Mangaluru taluk, while the remaining stock will be distributed among Bantwal, Belthangady, Puttur and Sullia. The DC instructed health department officials to depute Anganwadi and ASHA workers at vaccination centres. Meanwhile, Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat chief executive officer Kumar asked the officials to compile a list of those who were yet to receive the second dose of the Covid vaccine. On the possibility of allowing operation of buses between Mangaluru and Kasaragod, the DC said that the district administration would assess the situation prevailing in Kerala vis-à-vis Covid-19 in the coming week, and make a recommendation to the state government about relaxing restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/lasika-mela-dakshina-kannada-aims-to-administer-1-2-lakh-doses/articleshow/87191464.cms||---
---||Pune||Two years on, 4 FSI for TOD yet to show results; developers blame high rates||PUNE: The 4 FSI for transit-oriented development (TOD) is yet to provide a boost to the real estate boom more than two years after its announcement was made. Though building proposals have come, the demand for maximum 4 FSI utilisation is negligible. This has posed a question mark on the intended ‘densification near the Metro routes,’ expected by the Pune Municipal Corporation officials. The developers, on the other hand, claim that high premium FSI rates are a major put off for developers. Moreover, restrictions on the size of flats and parking spaces, too, are creating obstacles in promoting real estate projects in this zone. The civic officials said that the policy was drafted by the state government and the concerns of the developers would be shared with the authorities. As per the PMC officials, 18 projects have received sanctions under the TOD. But none of them has consumed the highest FSI. Not only new projects but also those, which were being developed in this zone before the announcement, have also been the beneficiaries of TOD policy. They have sent revised proposals of building plans by making changes in accordance with the new policy. Redevelopment projects have been coming forward to benefit from the new policy. “Residential as well as commercial projects have come up. We are approving the valid proposals with due diligence based on the policy,” said Sudhir Kadam, a senior official of the PMC’s building permission department. The state government in March 2019 had announced TOD in a 500m radius around Metro stations in Pune, and also fixed the maximum permissible floor space index at 4. The FSI would depend on factors such as road width and the size of the plot. The initiative was expected to promote real estate around Metro stations and ultimately increase footfall at Metro. The civic body has approved the proposal. According to it, the benefits of TOD can be made applicable at BRTS and HCMTR. Areas near a total of 60 stations will have TOD zones. The bigger plots, up to 4,000 sqm on the 30-metre-wide roads, would be eligible for additional four FSI. It has to be taken by paying premium charges. Anil Pharande, president, Credai-Pune Metro, said that there are several norms under the TOD zone, which needs to be reconsidered. In TOD zone of 500 metres, the developer has to compulsory use TOD FSI, where the premium to be paid is up to 75% of land rates, which is very expensive and more than double as compared to premium paid in other areas. Due to this, the project becomes unaffordable and unfeasible as it cannot compete with the areas outside the TOD zone. “We believe that the premium should be reduced to 25% and, if not, should be on a par with rest of the areas at 35%. For residential space in TOD zone, the maximum flat area for 50% development is restricted to 60 sqm, which is not practical. It is difficult to find customers who would opt for 60 sqm, especially in city-centric locales. Therefore, these restrictions should be removed,” he said. As per the Credai Pune, for parking norms in TOD zone, developers have to provide less parking space with flats less than 80 sqm. But in case the developer has to provide parking space to buyers, then it is subject to payment of premium, amplifying the cost of flats in TOD zone and leading to lowering of sale potential. Lastly, for lands which are on the borderline of 500 metres from the Metro stations, and marginally in the TOD zone, the developer has mandatorily to follow the TOD rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-yrs-on-4-fsi-for-tod-yet-to-show-results-developers-blame-high-rates/articleshow/87193303.cms||---

The protest, continuing for the past one week, is causing inconvenience to commuters on the national highway along the UP-Haryana border near Bidoli. The police had to intervene every time a traffic jam was reported but the farmers maintained that they would continue with their efforts as they had been selling their crops in Haryana’s Karnal mandi for decades. According to eyewitnesses, the Haryana police has placed a barricade at the Bidoli border and all the commuters are allowed to pass but only farmers with their tractor-trolleys have been stopped for the past 10 days. Whenever the farmers tried to cross over they were asked to go back. They would then sit on the highway as a mark of protest causing traffic snarls. “The Haryana police placed barricades at the border and only farmers are being stopped. We have been selling our crops in Karnal mandi for decades and now they are stopping us. Not a single representative from the UP government has tried to resolve the issue,” said Master Jahid, regional vice-president, BKU. He added the UP and Haryana governments must set up temporary grain markets on the borders so that farmers could sell their harvest every season and such bans on farmer’s entry to mandis must be lifted immediately. Anil Kumar, SSI Jhinjhana police station, told TOI that Haryana police has placed barricades on the border and are not allowing farmers to cross. "We request farmers to clear roads whenever the traffic jam is reported due to their protest," he added. Satpal Singh, in-charge of Manglore police outpost in Haryana, said the police have written orders from the state government to not let paddy farmers enter Haryana. “Its not that all the paddy crops are being denied entry. We are letting farmers with basmati and other rich varieties pass the border. Only those crops under the MSP are being stopped,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-protest-against-haryana-govts-order-of-banning-paddy-procurement-from-other-states/articleshow/87192144.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Pune Metropolitan Region active cases decline to least since mid-June last year||PUNE: The number of active Covid-19 cases dropped to 4,070 in the Pune Metropolitan Region on Thursday, its least since June 16 last year when the tally stood at 4,033. Health officials said active cases have dropped by 34% since the beginning of October alone. In the last 21 days, the active count has declined from 6,229 to 4,070. As many as 2,126 patients are in home isolation in PMR, while 1,944 are undergoing treatment at various hospitals across the region. The significant decline in active cases could be achieved on the back of the impressive drop in the cases in the rural parts, which have come down by almost 40% since October 1. In the Pune municipal areas, the active tally had dropped below to 1,000 and stands at 984 as against 760 in the Pimpri Chinchwad area. A health official said the rural parts were area of concern due to higher number of active caseload. The situation has, however, improved significantly in terms of daily case count over the last few weeks. The official said, “The region’s active caseload was around 4,500 in February ahead of the second wave. By the end of February, the case count increased to 5,500. For some days in April and May, the region had reported near to one lakh active patients. After that, however, there has been a gradual drop. We are now expecting the trend to continue.” Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief at PMC’s health department, said, “There were around 1,500 active cases in the PMC limits at beginning of October, which have dropped to 980 now. We have asked the health department and civic ward offices to monitor the cases. No ward has recorded case spurt in the last few weeks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-active-cases-decline-to-least-since-mid-june-last-yr/articleshow/87193305.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Delhi||Delhi: Mission to segregate waste all mixed up, running out of time||NEW DELHI: While there are fewer than 10 days left for North Delhi Municipal Corporation to enforce segregation of domestic waste, there doesn’t seem to be any urgency on the ground, with many residents, RWAs and market associations even claiming to be unaware of the November 1 deadline. Though the civic body claimed to have called several meetings with residents to explain the procedure for segregating waste into dry and wet stuff and the consequences of not doing so, the RWAs and residents of Civil Lines, Kamla Nagar and Mukherjee Nagar told TOI of their reluctance to fall in line. In fact, when TOI visited Mukherjee Nagar and Kamal Nagar, garbage collectors were picking up mixed waste from homes. There also were no separate compartments for the segregated trash in the municipal vans. Nitin Kumar Goel, president, Civil Lines Welfare Association, reported that waste was still being collected by private operators without segregation. “We will cooperate but the corporation has to make an effort to approach us,” he said. “I haven’t received any official communication saying it is mandatory to segregate waste.” Private waste pickers are necessary because municipal garbage vans do not collect trash regularly, said Jatin Sehgal, joint secretary, Citizens’ Welfare Association. “The waste collectors segregate the garbage themselves. They take out the recyclable waste and then dump the wet waste in the dhalaos,” he said. Asked why segregation hadn’t caught on, municipal officials cited lack of awareness among the residents and their lack of support for the idea. “It is easy to get bulk generators in commercial and factory areas to comply. The challenge is roping in the residential areas. Due to many reasons, we can’t even impose penalties,” one official. The officials hope that the new thrust to the campaign will bear results in all the 104 wards in the corporation area by December 31. “Our teams, which include assistant commissioners, sanitary officials and workers, are meeting residents every day,” the official said. “We are simultaneously looking for solutions for challenges such as transporting segregated and processed waste to the waste-to-energy power plants or the landfill. We plan to send tippers and vans with separate compartments for wet and dry waste to collect garbage from homes.” The residents, on their part, blamed the lackadaisical approach of civic officials. “After the Solid Waste Management Rules were notified, they gave many deadlines for implementing segregation, but never pursued it with enthusiasm,” alleged Nitin Gupta, president, Kamla Nagar Traders’ Association. “I received an invitation to a meeting on source segregation on October 27, but there was mention that day of November 1 being the deadline for compliance.” Chitra Mukherjee, an expert on sustainable livelihood and environment, said that the Solid Waste Management Rules stress on segregation of garbage at source by the waste generators. “When cities like Mysore, Panaji and Pune can do it, why can’t Delhi?” she said. “The problem is Delhi civic bodies lack the will and have no intention to impose fines on political considerations. The corporations have put the onus on garbage collecting contractors rather than set up dedicated waste collection teams.” In south Delhi, SDMC has targeted a December 31 deadline for waste segregation in 58 of its 104 wards. “Segregation is currently being carried out in 37 wards,” said a municipal official. “The overall success will depend on the residents. We are requesting the model wards to continue segregation no matter what happens.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mission-to-segregate-waste-all-mixed-up-running-out-of-time/articleshow/87193331.cms||Vibha Sharma

Special offers, free tickets and livestreaming a cricket match are among some of the plans they have. Owners said that not many Hindi film producers are willing to risk releasing films after suffering losses for the past several months. Arvind Chafalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India, said English films will be screened to start with. “A couple of English films will be screened in the coming week, and they are fine with the collection with the limited seating capacity. For Hindi films, it is going to be a big risk. We are banking on some more relaxations by Diwali and hoping that more movies will be released,” said Chafalkar. INOX Leisure Ltd has announced free tickets for October 22. Atul Bhandarkar, regional director (West), INOX Leisure Ltd, said the free tickets are being offered as welcome back gesture. Some multiplexes are also seeking permission to livestream the T20 Cricket World Cup’s India-Pakistan match on October 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/multiplexes-plan-free-tickets-livestreaming-of-matches/articleshow/87193319.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Speaking at a press conference, Congress spokespersons Manavata Rai and Ch Venkatesh said, “Revanth is the son of the soil, it is ludicrous to talk about his devotion to the region. Why is Sharmila not talking about attacks on farmers in Uttar Pradesh but condemning us here?” They further said that despite her valiant efforts to persuade the people of Telangana with her padayatra, they will not believe her. “Revanth has been questioning the TRS government’s faults for the past seven years, but she has arrived only recently,” they pointed out. They asked her to be grateful to the AICC high command for appointing her father YS Rajasekhara Reddy as Pradesh Congress Committee president and then chief minister. “His dream was to see Rahul Gandhi as prime minister. We respect him, after consensus, Revanth was designated TPCC chief, but he is not a chief hired from other parties,” they said. Meanwhile, Congress will ramp up campaigning in the Huzurabad assembly constituency. On Thursday, party president Revanth Reddy held an online conference with party leaders and gave them a plan for the next seven days. The party will also focus on campaigning against the BJP and TRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sharmila-a-political-tool-of-pm-modi-kcr-cong-hits-back/articleshow/87193328.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt to KRMB: Correct rule curves of Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar||HYDERABAD: Raising objections over the methodology being adopted by the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) while finalising operational protocols of Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar irrigation projects, the Telangana government asked the KRMB to make corrections in the rule curves by incorporating the provisions of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-1. The state government said the methodology considered for developing the rule curves was erroneous and did not comply with the provisions of KWDT-1, which was known as Bachawat Award. A rule curve or rule level specifies the storage or empty space to be maintained in a reservoir during different times of the year. In a letter to KRMB chairman MP Singh, special chief secretary (irrigation) Rajat Kumar on Thursday said the allocation of Krishna river waters was under the consideration of KWDT-II. Till KWDT-II decides allocations, KWDT-1 has to be followed in letter and spirit for sharing of Krishna waters, he said. “The rule curves in respect of Srisailam reservoir restrict consumptive use by AP to 34 tmcft, which is the maximum drawal that can be permitted as per inter-state agreement and Planning Commission’s approval,” Rajat Kumar said. Following the Centre’s gazette notification on river boards, the KRMB on October 20 examined the rule curves and operational protocols pertaining to both the major irrigation projects. Rajat Kumar said the entire methodology considered in the rule curves was erroneous and the KWDT-1 had clearly stated that the Srisailam project — being a hydro-electric project for generation of power without diverting water to another watershed — did not involve consumptive use of water except for evaporation losses. “Neither the KRMB nor the Centre has the power to reinterpret the provisions of the KWDT-1 award,” he said. Taking data from 2014-15 onwards for working out the average utilisations is not only in violation of the award but will also serve to strengthen the illegitimate claims of AP for transferring Krishna waters to outside the basin through Pothireddypadu Head Regulator and Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanthi project, the special chief secretary said. Officials said Nagarjuna Sagar gets water from Srisailam reservoir and it was necessary to make a provision for carryover storages in the rule curves for both reservoirs as it was the mandate of the Bachawat Award.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-krmb-correct-rule-curves-of-srisailam-nsagar/articleshow/87193325.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Famous eateries keep prices unchanged despite rising vegetable prices||KOLHAPUR: Sanjay Karande, the owner of Shiv misal, a famous misal eatery in Kolhapur, has decided to keep his rates unchanged despite the increase in prices of the ingredients required to make the misal. Like Karande, several other eatery owners have also decided to keep the rates unchanged. The prices of key ingredients like onions, tomatoes and coriander have witnessed a drastic hike this week. Along with these key ingredients, the prices of the other ingredients like oil and spices too are already high. The price of a bunch of coriander was Rs 20 a week ago, which is now being sold at Rs 60. Tomatoes are being sold at Rs 70 per kg and onions at Rs 80 per kg. Given the rise in the rates, local cuisines such as misal, vada pav, thalipeeth, kanda bhaji along with the iconic mutton dishes, were expected to increase. “I believe the prices of these key ingredients are going to come down in a couple of weeks. The common man is already suffering due to the high inflation rate and low income. Therefore, even though we will make lower profits, it is morally incorrect to burden the regular customers by increasing the prices. I had last increased misal rates two years ago. Despite the pandemic and now with the soaring vegetable prices, I have decided to keep the misal rate at Rs 45,” said Karande. When the customers waiting outside hotel Veluvan, famous for thalipeeth and other local dishes, asked the owner Akshay Hukkeri if he is replacing costlier ingredients with cheaper ones, he said, “I simply ask customers to taste the food and if they find that I have used alternative ingredients — for instance, chopped cabbage instead of onion — I will not take their money.” “We have to ensure that the food quality, as well as the quantity, is maintained to retain our customers. Coriander was just Rs 10 per bunch some time back. Hoping that the rates will reduce once the fresh stock starts arriving, I have not increased the price of any food item on the menu,” added Hukkeri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-famous-eateries-keep-prices-unchanged-despite-rising-vegetable-prices/articleshow/87190870.cms||---

Speaking at a Police Commemoration Day event at Hubballi-Dharwad City Armed Reserve Parade Ground here on Thursday, he said the state government is committed to provide all support to the home department to strengthen the policing system. “A peaceful environment is key for development of a nation. Police are doing a commendable job to establish peace and tranquillity in the state,” he said. “The police department plays a significant role in bringing peace and taking the country on the path of progress. We need to respect the sacrifice of such police personnel and their families,” he said. “We have launched several schemes for the welfare of police including recruitment of 16,000 personnel, constructing police quarters, Arogya Bhagya health scheme and others. We are bringing in many reforms in the home department by revising salary, giving promotions in all cadres, improving their life condition, giving thrust to modern weapons, upgrading FSL labs to expedite investigations and applying scientific approach for improving the police system,” he said. He advised police not to bow down to any pressure and other tactics and work honestly to maintain law and order. “With law and order in place, and a peaceful environment, many investors always prefer our state. This credit goes to our honest police officers who are working day and night to maintain law and order,” he said. He expressed concern over many youths falling prey to the online games and increasing gambling clubs. “To put an end to these gambling activities, we have brought in a new law which will give more strength to the police department to deal with these activities. Besides, we have created officers on crime scene posts and are appointing them to deal with gambling and other activities,” said Bommai. He also called upon people to support the department to deliver better service to society and said no one should forget the valuable contribution and sacrifice made by police. Legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti, district minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa, police commissioner Labhuram, deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil, ADGP Pratap Reddy, HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal and others were present. ‘Remember martys every day’Davanagere: ‘We are living safely because the police and the Army are protecting our country,” said Davanagere district principal sessions court judge Rajeshwari S Hegde. She was addressing the gathering paying tributes to the martyrs at the district armed police grounds here on Thursday as part of Police Martyr’s Day. Martyrs, she said should be remembered every day and not just on the day of Martyr’s Day, she contented. Portraits of such martyrs should be displayed in schools, colleges and main entry gates of important places so as to inspire the youth and public, she suggested. She also lauded the efforts of the traffic police who discharge their duties in the scorching sun, heavy rain and pollution. When public are disciplined, the job of police will be easy become simple, she contented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/police-stations-should-be-people-friendly-bommai/articleshow/87191157.cms||---

District collector Antar Singh Nehra on Thursday said that a special train will run for the Patwari recruitment examination on October 23 and 24. This special train will be operated by West Central Railway from Kota to Jaipur via Sawai Madhopur. The train will also reach Kota from Jaipur via Sawai Madhopur on both days. “Attempting to enter the centres with unwanted material, including mobile phones and other or other communication devices, and planting fake candidates will result in cancellation of their papers. They shall face lifelong ban from appearing in examinations conducted by the board in future. An FIR will also be lodged under the Rajasthan Public Examination (Prevention of Use of Unfair Means) Act,” Sharma said. He said the candidates must reach the examination centres one and a half hour before the examination begins. “All candidates appearing for the exam will have to follow a dress code. Candidates not following the dress code will not be allowed to enter the exam centres,” said Sharma. To ensure transparency, multi-faceted technology (frisking) and equipment (metal detectors) will be used by the board. He said central superintendents, additional central superintendents, internal vigilance teams, and police observers have been deployed at all the examination centres. “Candidates will be allowed to enter the examination centres only after thorough search, identification on the basis of photo identity cards, frisking and metal-detector checking,” said Sharma. Arrangements have been made to install CCTV cameras at the examination centres and halls to ensure strict vigilance to keep a tab on cheating and rigging of the exam. “The board can mark out roll numbers of some suspicious candidates at its own level and confidentially send those to the district administration and police officials for special vigilance,” he said. Out of 15.62 lakh candidates, 5.02 lakh are female candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patwari-exam-legal-action-for-carrying-phones-planting-fake-candidates/articleshow/87193343.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat gets CM Yogi Adityanath's feedback on political situation||LUCKNOW: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat held a 30-minute meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath at Bharti Bhawan, the Sangh office in Lucknow, late Thursday. The meeting assumed significance in the wake of high-stakes assembly elections early next year. While RSS and BJP leaders remained tight-lipped about the one-on-one, it’s learnt that chief minister Yogi Adityanath gave his feedback on the prevailing political situation and welfare measures taken up by his government in the last four-and-a-half years. Covid management too figured prominently in the meeting. The RSS boss is said to have given his suggestions to Yogi, who is considered the undisputed face of BJP in the forthcoming UP elections. Bhagwat reached Lucknow after visiting Ayodhya, where the Ram temple is being constructed. The meeting, not surprisingly, lent traction to the theory that BJP was keen to step up the clamour around Ram Temple, besides projecting nationalism as a potent tool to counter a belligerent opposition in the run-up to 2022 elections. The RSS chief’s visit to Ayodhya and Lucknow comes amidst the Opposition escalating pressure on BJP on a host of issues, including farmers’ protest and the recent custodial death of a Dalit in Agra. Yogi has been receiving strong endorsement from top Sangh functionaries in the recent times, especially over handling of Corona and the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bhagwat-gets-cms-feedback-on-political-situation/articleshow/87194245.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Dehradun||Five of trekking team from Uttarakhand found dead in Himachal Pradesh||DEHRADUN/SHIMLA: A day after 11 climbers — majority of them from West Bengal — who were on a trek from Harsil in Uttarakhand to Chitkul in Himachal Pradesh went missing following heavy snowfall in the region, bodies of five trekkers were recovered in Kinnaur (Himachal Pradesh) while two were rescued alive. This comes even as four more tourists — all of them from Kolkata — were reported to have died during a trek to Sunderdhunga valley in upper Kumaon. Talking about the Sunderdhunga trek, Kapkot (in Bageshwar) sub-divisional magistrate Paritosh Verma told TOI that a porter, Harak Singh, accompanying the six-member team had returned from the trek and informed the administration that four trekkers had been buried alive in the snow while two had gone missing. “We have sent a State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team as well as a medical team to the site. We have also rescued 42 tourists from the region,” he said. Extreme weather in the two Himalayan states has left hordes of tourists stranded. At least 80 tourists, mostly from West Bengal, Punjab, Delhi and Himachal, have been stranded at Batal in Spiti valley of Himachal since Sunday when heavy snowfall blocked the Manali-Kaza highway. They have taken refuge in two dhabas and a government rest house. More than 100 tourists are currently stranded in Darma and Byas valleys in Uttarakhand and the district administration has decided to airlift them. Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh authorities said that bodies of trekkers would be airlifted to Uttarkashi on Friday as bad weather prevented the chopper sortie on Thursday. A rescue team comprising Army and ITBP personnel in Kinnaur district had recovered the bodies and rescued two climbers. The trekkers, including a woman from New Delhi and seven people from West Bengal, were part of a 17-member team that set out last week on the trek — which, at over 17,000 feet, goes through some of the most remote areas of Uttarakhand and HP. Deputy commissioner (Kinnaur) Abid Hussain Sadiq said that on Wednesday evening they got information that 11 tourists -- coming towards Chitkul from Uttarkashi – had got caught in the snow. He said they contacted officials of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force and Army and rescue and relief work was started on Thursday. ITBP personnel started the operation from Nithal Thach amid three and half feet of snow while the Army conducted an air rescue operation with the help of choppers. The rescue team found a tourist — identified as 31-year-old Mithun Dari from West Bengal — and a guide trapped and stranded in the snow. The tourist was airlifted to Uttarkashi while the guide would be transported on Friday. The Lahaul-Spiti administration will also attempt to evacuate all tourists stranded at Batal on Friday by road. The tourists were located after the administration launched an aerial and ground search operation on Thursday morning after family members of one of the stranded tourists sought help. While the Army's helicopter got some clues, the ground team found 80 tourists stranded at Batal which is infamous for its extreme weather conditions. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar said, "We received a phone call at about 1.30am that some tourists who were visiting Lahaul-Spiti could not be contacted ever since the roads got blocked. We immediately constituted a 15-member ground search team from Spiti and also sought help from the state government for aerial recce. As the valley is deep and peaks are steep, we were taking help from a small private helicopter. However, later the aerial recce was conducted with help of an Army helicopter." Kumar added that everything was not clearly visible from the helicopter but it spotted one vehicle near Chandratal lake and some vehicles at Batal. The stranded tourists included 16 from West Bengal who were travelling in one tempo traveller vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bodies-of-5-trekkers-on-harsil-chitkul-trek-found-4-more-from-kol-dead-in-kumaon/articleshow/87192179.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Self-defence training to start in colleges for women||Hubballi: A recent gang-rape of a girl in Mysuru, as well as other incidents of miscreants targeting women, appeared to have prompted the state government to take strong measures to ensure the safety of women in society. On the occasion of Police Commemoration Day on Thursday, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai announced in Hubballi that self-defence training will be provided to girl students in colleges across the state.The chief minister stated that KSRP has been entrusted with the responsibility of teaching students self-defence. “We will also rope in the services of officers who have served as principals in police training schools to train girls in self-defence. We face numerous challenges, including the safety of women. We have taken every precaution to ensure the safety of women in society. As a result, we intend to begin self-defence training in all colleges,” he said. Welcoming the move, K Chidambara, deputy director, PU Education, Dharwad, said, “We are currently raising awareness about laws intended for women through webinars and workshops, and we will provide self-defence tips in NCC and NSS camps. However, no college has a dedicated self-defence training cell. The state government’s decision to begin self-defence training will undoubtedly help girl students be stronger in the face of adversity. We will begin the training in all colleges as soon as we receive guidelines from the government,” he added.According to Lingaraj Angadi, principal of SJMV's Arts and Commerce College for Women, the proposed self-defence training will instil confidence among girls to fight eve-teasing and face difficult situations. Many victims do not report crimes to police because they do not receive justice. He believes that such training will help women protect themselves. K Ramarajan, DCP (law and order) said that officers from the KSRP and other police officers who know martial arts and are experts in self-defence techniques, will coordinate with colleges to provide training once the government issues guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/self-defence-training-to-start-in-colleges-for-women/articleshow/87191167.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The Yatra had covered several districts of the state. The immersion ceremony was attended by hundreds of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) members along with the national president of the farmers’ union, Naresh Tikait. The farmers initially garlanded the asthi kalash at Meerut’s Siwaye toll plaza. It reached Muzaffarnagar’s Shukartaal later in the day, where the immersion ritual took place. The farmer leaders immersed the ashes in the middle of the river amid vedic chants. Speaking on the occasion, Tikait said: “Farmers have been martyred in the Lakhimpur incident… this sacrifice of the farmers will always be written in the pages of history.” He said the BKU wants Union minister Ajay Mishra punished by the government and the new farm laws revoked. “If the government takes back the farm laws, we will step back,” Tikait said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ashes-of-farmers-killed-in-kheri-violence-immersed-in-ganga/articleshow/87192177.cms||Mohd Dilshad

This comes even as four more tourists — all of them from Kolkata — were reported to have died during a trek to Sunderdhunga valley in upper Kumaon. Talking about the Sunderdhunga trek, Kapkot (in Bageshwar) sub-divisional magistrate Paritosh Verma told TOI that a porter, Harak Singh, accompanying the six-member team had returned from the trek and informed the administration that four trekkers had been buried alive in the snow while two had gone missing. “We have sent a State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team as well as a medical team to the site. We have also rescued 42 tourists from the region,” he said. Extreme weather in the two Himalayan states has left hordes of tourists stranded. At least 80 tourists, mostly from West Bengal, Punjab, Delhi and Himachal, have been stranded at Batal in Spiti valley of Himachal since Sunday when heavy snowfall blocked the Manali-Kaza highway. They have taken refuge in two dhabas and a government rest house. More than 100 tourists are currently stranded in Darma and Byas valleys in Uttarakhand and the district administration has decided to airlift them. Meanwhile, Himachal Pradesh authorities said that bodies of trekkers would be airlifted to Uttarkashi on Friday as bad weather prevented the chopper sortie on Thursday. A rescue team comprising Army and ITBP personnel in Kinnaur district had recovered the bodies and rescued two climbers. The trekkers, including a woman from New Delhi and seven people from West Bengal, were part of a 17-member team that set out last week on the trek — which, at over 17,000 feet, goes through some of the most remote areas of Uttarakhand and HP. Deputy commissioner (Kinnaur) Abid Hussain Sadiq said that on Wednesday evening they got information that 11 tourists -- coming towards Chitkul from Uttarkashi – had got caught in the snow. He said they contacted officials of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force and Army and rescue and relief work was started on Thursday. ITBP personnel started the operation from Nithal Thach amid three and half feet of snow while the Army conducted an air rescue operation with the help of choppers. The rescue team found a tourist — identified as 31-year-old Mithun Dari from West Bengal — and a guide trapped and stranded in the snow.

---||Pune||Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial for adolescents set to begin in two Pune hospitals||PUNE: Two Pune hospitals are among the 11 trial sites in India where adolescents are being screened for US pharma major Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine advanced trials this month. Two doses of the vaccine will be given 57 days apart to about 100 candidates in the age group of 12 to 17 years to assess the vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity (immune response) profile. In the first phase, the trial will conduct the ‘dosing range’ study to determine the vaccine’s appropriate dosage. NK Arora, chairman, Centre’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, said, “These are multicentric international trials, in which India is also participating.” Maharashtra has four trial sites selected for the vaccine’s adolescent trials. In Pune, DY Patil Medical College and Hospital and KEM Hospital, Vadhu, are the sites. One hospital each in Nashik and Wardha are also among the trial sites. The other sites in India are located in Surat, Kanpur, Kolkata, Gurugram, New Delhi, Chennai and Mysuru. “This is competitive enrolment and we have already started shortlisting the adolescents. The shortlisted candidates are now being screened and only those fitting the criterion (those testing negative for Covid antibody test) will be enrolled for the phase 2/3 trial,” said D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital’s clinical trial research consultant Shalaka Agarkhedkar. Every child’s pre- and post-vaccination immunogenicity will be assessed and tracked during the trial period. “Since the vaccine is already found safe and effective in adults, there is not much hesitancy about this vaccine when parents are approached for enrolling their wards,” Agarkhedkar said. In the dose-finding study, different combinations of the vaccine dose will be given to 100 adolescents divided in four different categories “For example, if one set of 25 adolescents are given 0.25 (point two five) ml dose then another group will be given 0.5 ml dose. And two other dose compositions will be tried in two other sets of adolescents,” Agarkhedkar said All the candidates will then be assessed for safety, immunogenicity and vaccine-related side effects. The dose with excellent safety and immunogenicity profile and lesser side effects will further be tried in another 100 adolescents to consolidate the vaccine’s safety and immune response. Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have already received emergency use authorization in India. While ZyCoV-D is meant for adolescents, Covaxin can be given to children between 2 years and 18 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jj-vaccine-trial-for-adolescents-set-to-begin-in-two-pune-hospitals/articleshow/87193344.cms||Umesh Isalkar

NGT said the application by BJP’s Kirit Somaiya against Parab and the government of Maharashtra will be heard for admission. Somaiya had alleged that Parab carried out illegal construction of a seaside resort at Dapoli in Ratnagiri without environmental clearances. He complained to the state environment department and Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change and Lok Ayukta. “The government, in its report to the Lok Ayukta, admitted that the resort is illegal but it has done nothing to demolish it,” said Somaiya. Parab filed a Rs 100-crore defamation suit against Somaiya. Earlier, Somaiya complained about an illegal structure constructed by Parab in a Mhada space in Bandra (E). While Parab disowned the structure, Mhada, which had issued a showcause notice, withdrew it and apologised. Parab was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngt-issues-notice-to-mantri-anil-parab-to-appear-in-dapoli-seaside-resort-case/articleshow/87193349.cms||---

---||Delhi||Public access to toilets in Central Vista buildings||NEW DELHI: For the first time, the general public can access the public toilets that will be built along the boundary walls of new Central Secretariat buildings which will come up along the Rajpath replacing the existing office complexes. The provision has been made in compliance with the latest norms for public buildings laid in the Delhi Building Byelaws. Sources said each of the buildings will have such toilets in the “non-security” area and can be accessed from the main road and this will address a major concern of general public. A spokesperson of the Central Vista project architect, HCP Design, Planning and Management, confirmed that the necessary provision has been made for public convenience and as per the laid down norms. TOI has learnt that senior officials from the housing and urban affairs ministry in a recent meeting with the the design architect had sought clarifications on several issues including whether the public toilets in the buildings will be accessible from “outside or inside”. Sources said the officials had also flagged some gaps in the space allocation for officers above a certain rank. They had pointed out that cabins should be provided to officers of deputy secretary rank and above and shared cabins for under secretaries. Responding to this, the HCP spokesperson said, “The design provides work spaces and cabins as required by the client.” The officials had also flagged that the two proposed basements in the first three new buildings will have parking for 3,000 cars whereas currently over 4,000 car parking labels have been issued only in Nirman Bhawan building. The three buildings will accommodate employees of about four buildings like Nirman Bhawan. The HCP said, “All parking provisions are made in compliance with applicable local body byelaws.” Responding to the issue of monkey menace and bird intrusion in these buildings, which officials had raised in the meeting, the HCP said “suitable provisions” are being made to address these issues. The officials had also raised the concern over inadequate cafeteria, pantry and dining areas citing that the sitting provision for 670 people may not suffice considering the buildings will have around 6,000 employees and visitors as well. The architect said the capacities for cafeteria, pantry, dining areas and casual seating areas on campus are planned to be “adequate for the number of users”. In response to another question whether there will be a provision for connecting the three buildings at different levels instead of the current proposal of only connectivity through ground floor and basements as flagged in the meeting, the architect said the buildings will not be connected at upper levels. “The layout has been prepared taking into consideration optimum connectivity and security provisions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/public-access-to-toilets-in-central-vista-buildings/articleshow/87193342.cms||Dipak K Dash

The complainant, who runs a hair cutting salon, came in contact with the suspect through a friend in March this year. “The suspect promised to sell him an almost brand new scooter at less than Rs 30,000 of its original cost. The complainant was told he would be registered as the second owner of the vehicle,” said a Pimpri police officer. The suspect told the complainant to pay Rs 60,000 in cash. Although he promised to register the vehicle in the buyer’s name, the suspect began avoiding him. When the complainant approached the dealer, he was shocked to discover that the vehicle is collateral for a loan, registered on another person’s name. The suspect has been booked for charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust under the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-dupes-pimpri-resident-of-rs-60k-booked/articleshow/87193355.cms||---

The man had consumed a large amount of medicines. According to DCP (cyber) KPS Malhotra, an urgent message was received from Facebook regarding a person posting self-harm-related stuff. “Facebook shared details of the profile on which a technical inquiry was taken up immediately to trace the whereabouts of the person,” the DCP added. The location of the profile was traced to west Delhi after which the information was shared with west and southwest district cops in real time. Using the coordinates, a team of cops from Rajouri Garden traced the person at his home. “He was in a semi-conscious condition at the time of rescue and was rushed to hospital. During inquiry, it emerged that he had consumed 40-50 bottles of a syrup used in the treatment of thyroid-related problems,” DCP Malhotra added. Cops found during the probe that the person’s wife had left his home around three years ago and was living in Bhopal. He also lost his job last year. On Thursday morning, he talked to his wife as he wanted to visit her but she refused to meet him. He then decided to end his life and took to Facebook to make his wife and her family watch him die. However, the cops acted swiftly and saved him.

---||Hyderabad||Dilapidated Trikutalayam temple in Jangaon cries out for restoration||JANGAON: The Ramappa temple in Mulugu has got the world interested after the Unesco heritage tag. But another ancient temple from around the same Kakatiya era, the 500 pillar Trikutalayam temple in Jangaon, is crying out for at least some attention from local officials. The temple is dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Sun, hence the name Trikutalayam. Decrepit and partially dismantled now, in its heydays prayers continued for many centuries in the temple located in Nidigonda village of Raghunadhapalli mandal in Jangaon. But now it is mostly a hub for anti-social elements. While some effort was made by the state to restore it in 1996 and Rs 20 lakh was allocated, the contractor left the work midway. With no guards, robbers made away with excellent stone-sculptures, while the granite stones regularly get stolen, villagers said. Locals alleged that the archaeology department turned a blind eye to restoration of the historic temple after removing pillars, stones and leaving the Shiva idol outside. “The negligence of officials is clear as they didn’t even bother to number the pillars or stones to enable restoration correctly,” a villager said. The Trikutalayam temple was built by Kudumamba, younger sister of Kakatiya king Gabapathideva, as gratitude towards her brother after he gifted her Nidigonda village. The temple became popular after the 1,000 pillar temple at Hanamkonda. During sunrise and sunset, the Sun’s rays fall on the Shiva Lingam inside the Trikutalayam temple, villagers said. “The Trikutalayam temple is just 500 metres from the Warangal-Hyderabad National Highway-163. It can be easily developed into a tourist hub. The government should take steps to restore it,” a villager said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dilapidated-trikutalayam-temple-injangaon-cries-out-for-restoration/articleshow/87193353.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Dehradun||Dehradun gets country’s first Gorkhali community radio station||DEHRADUN: Emphasising that community radios are important for nation-building, preservation of language, culture and heritage, Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) on Wednesday inaugurated the country’s first Gorkhali community radio station at Gorkhali Sudhar Sabha in Garhi Cantt area of Dehradun. Listeners can tune into the radio station ‘Gham Chhaya’ on the frequency 90.0 FM between 7-11 am and 5-9 pm. Those behind the initiative say the idea is to preserve and promote the culture of the Gorkha community. “Over the years, the community has lost its identity and heritage, with language, too, not piquing the interest of many. The radio will be the voice of the community and repository of its information,” said Madhu Gurung, one of the founders. The aim is also to bring the community together, Gurung added. “It is an amazing initiative and the first of its kind radio in India. It will lift the community’s spirits and also promote the culture. It will broadcast programmes in different languages like Garhwali and Jaunsari, apart from Hindi and English. We hope it turns out to be a big success,” said Col BN Thapa (retd). Programmes will largely focus on spirituality, women and health welfare, career counselling and promotion of Nepalese writers’ works, those behind the initiative said. India has around 1.5 crore Gorkhas, of which nearly 15 lakh are based in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-gets-countrys-first-gorkhali-community-radio-station/articleshow/87192192.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Nagpur||Economically wrong to invest in coal now, says UN secy gen||Nagpur: “To invest in coal for the future is building white elephants, building stranded assets. And I don’t think developing countries have enough resources to waste,” says United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres, while responding to a question raised by TOI on India’s continued investments in coal-fired power plants. Guterres was interacting with journalists across the globe during a virtual press meet organized by Covering Climate Now, an organisation of media outlets from across the world. Gueterres, 72, was wearing a usual formal blazer and tie but unwonted worry lines on his forehead, which probably had less to do with ageing. “I am extremely worried yet hopeful. The progress by nations in recent weeks has not been enough. We are getting closer to the Conference of Parties (COP) and I hope there is still time to avoid a failure in Glasgow. Things are getting more difficult and I am afraid they might go wrong,” he says, when pointed out that he was sounding pessimistic ahead of COP26. This year’s COP, to be hosted by the United Kingdoms in Glasgow, is the most-awaited meet as it will be the first time the Paris Agreement will be revisited and global leaders will need to show how they have met their declared targets. Addressing TOI’s question on how a highly populated country like India can make a complete energy transition, Guterres says, “It is certain that coal is an investment that is condemned; to invest in it is a decision that is economically wrong. Countries which are hugely dependent on coal need to increase their electrical production to ensure electricity for all. For this, I appeal to the developed world to establish coalitions to support such nations and help them in accelerating their transition towards clean energy.” Referring to his interactions with the Indian leaders, Guterres recalls how they “always say Paris Agreement establishes a principle of common but differentiated responsibilities depending on nations’ capabilities”. While the secretary-general agreed this was true and developed countries need to lead, he also stressed that the time has now come for “emerging economies to go an extra mile”. On Friday, Union environment minister for India Bhupendra Yadav stated that climate finance will be the most vital issue at COP26. In 2009, the developed nations had pledged to provide $100 billion annually to their developing counterparts for combating climate change – a promise that is yet to see the light. Guterres is wary of what the lack of finance can do. “The promised money is needed for mitigation and adaptation but most importantly, it is essential for re-building trust between the developed and developing world. How the $100 billion will materialise is a fundamental condition to bring back this trust,” he adds. The UN chief then faces questions on uncertainty over the success of COP. He doesn’t mince his words while answering. “The negotiations held at COP in Katowice two years ago were very difficult, the meet at Madrid was a complete disaster. We have reached some tipping points which will make damage done by climate change irreversible. We need to stop it and that is why the meet at Glasgow is essential. We need to make sure that there are strong commitments to reduce emissions and commitments to finance developing countries, with a high percentage devoted to adaptation,” says Guterres. He finally answers what has been a unanimous contemplation – ‘How are we on the verge of abyss?’ “The debate lasted too long for a very simple reason. Until very recently, say about seven years ago, there was no effective conscience at the level of a global public opinion that we are really moving towards disaster. And the lobby of the economic interest, namely the one of fossil fuels engaged in a very strong campaign, putting into question the scientific discoveries about climate change. They even found some “scientists” to corroborate their ideas. Like the tobacco industry did for years, explaining people that tobacco was not dangerous,” says Guterres. He goes on to point out that the wake-up call came very late. “And when it came, things started to accelerate and this led to the Paris Agreement,” he adds. But will the accord become a reality? As the secretary general had said in his opening remarks, “We are not seeing the level of ambition required to get there. The time for diplomatic niceties is over. If leaders do not stand up, we are headed for terrible human suffering.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/economically-wrong-to-invest-in-coal-now-says-un-secy-gen/articleshow/87211707.cms||Manka Behl
---||Pune||Pune: Fewer bookings leave private bus operators glum||PUNE: Private bus operators in the city are averse to any major increase in fare this Diwali amid fewer festive bookings. While the state transport department has allowed them to increase fare according to a set formula, a majority of the transporters said it was not an option since bookings were anyway less this year. According to the transport department, a private bus operator can increase the fare by 50% of the fare charged by an MSRTC bus plying on the same route. “The bookings for Diwali are between 40% and 45% compared to regular years. Amid this, we cannot risk losing customers by increasing fares,” a private transporter said. Ravindra More, manager of Prasanna Purple, said, “The fare is increased during festival times to balance the cost incurred on buses returning empty to Pune from a certain location. Amid the current situation, we are not in a position to call back buses once passengers have been dropped.” Another transporter, who has a fleet plying to the Marathwada region, said fares had been hiked nominally because of high fuel costs. “The hike has been 10%-15%. There is a lot of competition and as the passengers are aware of it, they are bargaining. Maximum people who travelled during Diwali were IT professionals and students,” he said. The state-run MSRTC said it would run around 650 additional buses to different parts of the state and the neighbouring states during Diwali. Baba Shinde, the president of Maharashtra State Goods and Passenger Transport Association, told TOI that bus fares would be increased to double four days before and four days after Diwali. “We are doing this mainly because of the increase in fuel rates,” Shinde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fewer-bookings-leave-pvt-bus-operators-glum/articleshow/87193345.cms||Joy Sengupta

The residents have been appealing to both the officials of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) and the elected representatives to fix their many problems, but their pleas have gone unheeded.That Rajiv Gandhi Nagar is only five kilometres away from the Someshwara temple in the heart of the city only serves to emphasise the apathetic attitude of the authorities concerned. Students of the local government school have to cross a railway track to reach it, leaving parents understandably anxious. Worse still is the fact that the school lacks many basic facilities including sufficient lavatories, and a water dispenser.Sources said that Rajiv Gandhi Nagar is home to roughly 4,000 people. Residents pointed to the need for a primary care centre, and a community hall in their neighbourhood. The residents cannot but feel sorry for the plight of the government school students. “Since this is a slum, we do not have a sewage network. The officials must take cognisance of our many problems, and develop basic facilities in our neighbourhood,” said Rajiv Gandhi Nagar resident Maruti H.Fellow resident Vijaylakshmi Bhavi said that the lack of streetlights in the locality was a particularly disturbing problem. “Politicians visit the area when they want our votes, but not once do they come here after the election. I am appealing to the elected representatives to take note of our problems, and fix them,” she said.Newly-elected corporator for the locality Laxmi Hindasgeri said that she would bring the many woes faced by the people of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar to the attention of the HDMC Council at the general body meeting. She added that she would also discuss the need to develop basic amenities in the locality with the MLA and MP. “I will ensure that the infrastructure at the school is improved, and facilities developed to provide drinking water to students. I will also discuss the issue of building an overbridge at the railway track near the school,” Laxmi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rajiv-gandhi-nagar-residents-want-their-many-problems-solved/articleshow/87191170.cms||---

The mother was also an accused, but the court acquitted her. According to cops, the step-father began raping the child when she was about 11 years old and she gave birth to a boy in 2019. Both the step-father and the child’s own mother threatened her to keep quiet and told neighbours that her husband was abroad. Subsequently, the child became pregnant twice and it was aborted, police said. The incident came to light after a relative of the child approached cops and filed a complaint in March this year with Kanchanbagh police. The accused step-father was arrested on March 11 and the police made her mother also an accused for abetting the crime. “The accused has been found guilty and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of natural life. He has to also pay a fine of Rs 26,000,” the first additional metropolitan sessions judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/step-dad-gets-life-term-for-raping-child/articleshow/87193369.cms||---

Navi Mumbai DCP (Crime) Suresh Mengade said, “The key accused, Manish Ambekar (44), and his aide Anthony Jungali (37) were arrested from Nalasopara. Ambekar is the mastermind, who imitated female voices and conned his victims.

Figures provided by the Pune airport authorities revealed that 11.21 crore doses of Covishield vaccine were transported in September, the highest since the transportation began, and more than 21% higher than August. The first consignment of the Covishield vaccine, consisting of 2.6 lakh doses, left the Pune airport for Delhi on January 13. By May this year, more than 10 crore doses were transported. Between June and September, around 31.31 crore doses were transported from Pune. Though large consignments of the vaccine have been transported from Pune, a large part of the vaccine is either transported from Pune by road or from the Mumbai airport. “The limited air connectivity in Pune is the basic reason. The issue of shifting the cargo hold area has remained stuck even after Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s recent comment on land transfer,” another airport official said. “The figures show that vaccine transportation from the airport has been on the rise. With SII set to manufacture Sputnik-V too, it will go up further,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/42-5cr-doses-of-covishield-flown-via-city-airport/articleshow/87193367.cms||Joy Sengupta

The Teja variety of chilli is being sold at Rs 11,601 per quintal, which is the maximum price commanded by the producer. K Uppalaiah, a farmer from Uppugal village of Zaffergadh mandal in Jangaon district, said, “I brought 14 bags of red chillies. The price offered was Rs 11,601 per quintal. We farmers are surprised at the rate for a commercial crop like chilli that has arrived early in the market. However, it is doubtful if the same price will be offered in December by traders. If the arrivals increase, the price may fall due to the demand and supply.” Speaking to the reporters, Enumamula agriculture market secretary BV Rahul said that farmers start harvesting chilli in the month of December every year, when chilli crop arrives in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/red-chillies-arrive-early-fetch-hot-price/articleshow/87193362.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

HC seeks reply on PIL||Nainital: The Uttarakhand High Court (HC), while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging orders of the state government regarding exemption of construction work without maps, asked the municipal council, Rishikesh to file a reply within four weeks. The next hearing of the case is scheduled on November 24.The matter was heard by a division Bench comprising Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma. Kotdwar resident Mujeeb Naithani has filed the PIL, saying that the government had created district development authorities (DDAs) in many districts in 2016. The government issued two orders on March 1, 2021 and June 2021, allowing construction work in these areas without a map. Both these orders were challenged by the petitioner on the ground that they are against the rules. Naithani says the orders will lead to a rise in illegal construction. He adds that these orders will not be beneficial to individuals, but only builders. The petitioner wants these orders to be repealed as they are “not in public interest”. In the PIL, the state government, director of urban planning in Uttarakhand, chief administrator of housing and urban development, Dehradun, secretary of the district development authority, Pauri, district magistrate of Pauri, and the municipal corporation of Kotdwar have been made parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/construction-without-maps-hc-seeks-reply-on-pil/articleshow/87192197.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Airline brings hot meals back on 2 hour-plus flights||MUMBAI: Here is yet another sign of life slowly getting back to normal in the domain of air travel. After being pummelled on social media for its boxed cold meal of sandwiches and calzones, full-service carrier Vistara on Thursday reintroduced hot meals onboard its domestic flights with over two-hour journey duration.In keeping with the Covid standard operating procedure that calls for minimised interaction between passengers and flight attendants, the airline will be serving only vegetarian meals for now. The airline said it had temporarily replaced hot meals with pre-packaged snacks in economy class in line with the government guidelines put in place to check the spread of Covid. “Customer feedback that Vistara received in recent times suggests that travellers are becoming more confident about consuming meals on board,” the airline said. “The inflight menu will be refreshed every three days,” the airline said in a press statement, adding that the meals will include customer favourites such as medu vada, vegetable biryani with dal makhani, jeera pulao with chana masala among other items. Over 60-70% of domestic flights operated by Vistara are those of over two-hour duration. Last year, customer feedback on in-flight meals was mixed, said Vinod Kannan, chief commercial officer, Vistara. After domestic flight operations resumed in May, the airline received a polarized response from its flyers, he said. One group of passengers wanted proper hot meal service, while others wanted to skip meals in order to stay masked and safe. “So we decided to come up with a box meal. Passengers who were hungry could consume it on board the flight, others could take the box with them and consume it later,” said Kannan. In the past few months though, the airline industry has been seeing a steady increase in demand for air travel, bolstered by increasing vaccination rates. The government recently removed capacity restrictions on airlines to permit them to operate at their full pre-Covid capacity. But inflight dining on board full service carriers will return only in phases. “We don’t want to be in a position where we have dropped the guard completely. So we have started with vegetarian meals and if there are no complaints from passengers about hot meals being served on board, we can build on this later and introduce non-vegetarian meals,’’ he added. The other full service carrier, Air India, has been serving hot meals on flights of over two hours duration, said an Air India official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/airline-brings-hot-meals-back-on-2hr-plus-flights/articleshow/87194926.cms||---

One such racket being run by a commerce graduate from Bihar was busted by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch. The gang had committed a series of carjackings. Three vehicles, two Innova and a Creta, were looted in the first fortnight of October. The arrested man, Ashish Rai alias Prince (30), belongs to Siwan. He was nabbed by a team comprising inspector Alok Rajan and others from the special operations squad. His associates, Ravi Pandey, Swet Singh and Rajbir, are also from Siwan. Rai’s gang was involved in a spate of carjacking incidents in Northwest, Outer, Rohini and West districts of Delhi. Police had been collecting information about suspects in recent carjackings when head constable Dinesh got a tip-off about Rai’s involvement in the crimes. A team led by ACP Arvind laid a trap in Vijay Vihar of outer Delhi and Rai was apprehended after a brief chase. A Hyundai Creta was seized from him. It was found that the Creta had been snatched at gunpoint by Rai and his gang members from Prashant Vihar. They had abducted the driver and later dumped him on the roadside before fleeing with the vehicle. Rai had been hiding in a rented accommodation in Budh Vihar.

Despite the new academic session for government-run primary schools commencing on April 1, education department has thus far failed to supply books to students of primary (classes I to V) and upper primary (class VI to VII) schools of the district. Only 15 per cent students have been given books, that too of select subjects. A standard answer that officials give when asked about the delay is -- Covid-19. According to basic education department records, around 2.48 students are enrolled in primary and upper primary schools of Agra district. On the basis which, around 15 lakh books were ordered. Deadline set by state government for department authorities and publishers to ensure distribution of books among students was April 30. But the latter failed to meet the deadline and students are suffering. District president of primary teachers’ association Brajesh Dixit said, “Textbooks required for the current session have not been supplied to schools so far. Around 225 government-run English medium schools have not received even a single book. This is resulting in learning loss, with students losing interest in studies. Basic education department officials have been apprised of the situation.” Assuring school authorities of doing the needful, additional director (basic education) Mahesh Chand said, “Distribution of books is in progress and will be completed by the end of this month. Schools have been asked to provide details of books that they haven’t got. The delay is because of Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/primary-school-students-without-textbooks-for-5-months-now/articleshow/87192202.cms||---

Nainital remained the worst-hit in terms of casualties as the death toll in the district climbed to 34 followed by Champawat district where 11 people have died. Union home minister Amit Shah also undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas even as relief and rescue operations continued in the worst-hit Kumaon division. Almost 17 teams of NDRF, 60 teams of SDRF, 15 companies of PAC and 5,000 police personnel are still engaged in rescue and relief operations. Shah, who chaired a high-level meeting with senior officials at the Dehradun airport after assessing the damage, said that timely warning by the Centre had helped in minimising loss of lives. “After the central government issued a warning 24 hours in advance, a large amount of damage was prevented,” he said, adding that chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had taken swift action. “Advance alerts were sent to all mobile consumers on their mobile phones, so that unnecessary movement could be avoided. The pilgrims of Char Dham were also stopped where they were, before rains started and due to this there is no news of any casualty of any of the pilgrims of Char Dham and the yatra has now been started," said the home minister. Shah said that except three roads, traffic movement has started on most of the roads. Nainital, Haldwani and Almora roads have also been opened to traffic. Railway tracks have suffered heavy damage at one place and repair work has also begun. More than 60% electricity supply has been restored, he said. “In this hour of crisis, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to the Uttarakhand chief minister many times since the very first day and the central government has put in all its strength to help Devbhoomi,” Shah added. Survey teams of the Ministry of Home Affairs will visit the state to take stock of the damage, he said, adding that an amount of Rs 250 crore has been issued by the Centre to the state a few months ago by the disaster management department. He said the Centre has already released assistance of Rs 749 crore as the Central share under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

The conferment of the mahamandaleshwar title -- one of the highest titles conferred on a seer by an akhara -- on the Dasna head priest came as a surprise for many religious watchers in Haridwar since Narasinghanand had until recently almost been "persona non-grata" for the akharas due to his numerous controversial statements. Earlier this year, an FIR was lodged against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. He was also in news after a 14-year-old Muslim boy, who went inside the Dasna Devi temple to have water, was assaulted by the priest’s disciple and he justified the act. A seer who did not wish to be named, said that the elevation of Narasinghanand seemed to be a reflection of the akharas’ “changed outlook towards the Muslim demography in Uttarakhand”. On Tuesday, Mahant Hari Giri had also claimed that the population of Muslims in Haridwar district has increased "exponentially'' and that it was a "worrying trend". In fact, Giri wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he had cited the "rise of the population of Muslims in Haridwar" and urged the PM to prevent Uttarakhand from becoming the “next Kashmir”. The letter was also sent to Union home minister Amit Shah, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, all MPs, MLAs and ex-CMs of the hill state, BJP and Congress’s Uttarakhand presidents and the leader of opposition in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/controversial-dasna-priest-is-now-juna-akhara-mahamandaleshwar/articleshow/87192255.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Chandigarh||SAD (Sankyukt) leaders deny alliance talks with Amarinder||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has denied any talks with the ousted chief minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh of alliance for the state assembly polls early next year. “Nobody has talked to me on this issue and I do not want to react to such statements. For our party, addressing farmers’ issues is of paramount importance. Then only our party can think what needs to be done,” said the Rajya Sabha member. He said his party’s stand was clear that it would not go into an alliance with BJP or SAD or the Congress. “We are also opposing every decision of the central government-led by the BJP to destroy the federal system by snatching powers from the state governments,” said Dhindsa. At the same time, his party had been seeking timely justice in desecration of Guru Granth Sahib which the incumbent Congress government in Punjab had failed to provide in the last four and half years under the leadership of Capt Amarinder as chief minister. Amarinder had on Tuesday announced that he was going to launch his own political party. “Hopeful of a seat arrangement with @BJP4India in 2022 Punjab Assembly polls if #FarmersProtest is resolved in farmers’ interest. Also looking at alliance with like-minded parties such as breakaway Akali groups, particularly Dhindsa & Brahmpura factions,” Amarinder had tweeted. Another SAD (Sanyukt) leader and former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura said, “Till date our party’s stand is very clear that if any political party will go in alliance with the BJP, we cannot ally with that party.” He said that Amarinder is just making one side statement hardly four months before the state assembly elections, that too when his own political party is yet to take birth. “If Amarinder is so confident of resolving farmers’ issues by talking to the central government led-by BJP now, when he is looking for his own survival in politics, where was he sleeping for the last over one year,” questioned Brahmpura. “Though it is not me alone who will take any decision about the alliance with any political party but even for that there should be some party on the ground and its agenda clear,” said Brahmpura, taking a dig at Amarinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-sankyukt-leaders-deny-alliance-talks-with-amarinder/articleshow/87193399.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Rajkot||Loan dispute: Man robbed of car, gun||Rajkot: A dispute over repayment of loan resulted in a gym owner from the city being robbed of his car, jewellery, licenced revolver and live cartridges by a friend. The complainant Ravi Patel, a resident of Ambika Township, registered a complaint with Rajkot taluka police station against Kaushik Dapani, Tirth Patel and Sagar Patel. According to the case details, Patel, who runs a gym on Kalavad road, had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from his friend Dapani three years back. For the last few months, Dapani had been demanding Patel to return the money saying that he also borrowed the amount from his sister. Patel on Wednesday night reached Dapani’s house to pay the interest amount. But Dapani insisted on getting the principal amount. As things between them turned violent, Dapani’s two other friends — Tirth and Sagar — too joined in the altercation. Patel alleged that the three snatched his car, gold chain and revolver. Dapani immediately reached the police station and registered a complaint against all three under IPC sections 384, 323 and 504.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/loan-dispute-man-robbed-of-car-gun/articleshow/87192267.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||No poll pact with PSP-L will hurt Akhilesh even more, says Shivpal||Lucknow: Politics is all about optimism. And who knows this better than Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party Lohia chief Shivpal Yadav. Even after the deadline of October 11 he had set to wait for SP chief Akhilesh’s ‘yes’ to the alliance with his party getting over, Shivpal, though hopeful of the same in future, warned Akhilesh of suffering losses if there was no alliance. “Politics is all about possibilities, one should not end possibilities in politics,” Shivpal told TOI said, but sounded yet another warning: if Akhilesh fails to form an alliance with his party, it would be a great loss for the SP chief and not for him. “I have achieved what I had to. He is the one who has to become the chief minister,” Shivpal said. Shivpal, like Akhilesh, has launched a yatra — Samajik Parivartan Yatra. In the second phase of the yatra, that would end at Rae Bareli on Friday, Shivpal said the response has been overwhelming and has boosted his confidence. Interestingly, Akhilesh’s ‘Vijay Yatra’ began on October 12 from Kanpur and the same day Shivpal began his yatra from Mathura. “The huge response which I am getting will only allow me to field candidates from the PSPL at many places,” Shivpal said. However, he was candid in his admission that his first priority for the alliance is the Samajwadi Party. He said that at the moment he was taking out a yatra and he also doesn’t have any time to sit and talk about the alliance with his nephew. He will think about the alliance once the yatra is over. Shivpal, in the second phase of the yatra that began from October 18 from Kanpur Dehat, was at Fatehpur on Thursday. His yatra would take a night halt at Prayagraj before reaching Amethi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Union minister Smriti Irani on October 22. Replying to a question on whether Akhilesh has any fear of you capturing the SP once there is an alliance, Shivpal said, “I have said earlier also that he would be the chief minister if SP comes to power.” He further added: “If he has any fear of that sort he should sit and talk on the issue. I am otherwise also in a win-win situation. If Akhilesh doesn’t agree for an alliance, then also it’s a win-win situation as he would be able to give tickets to many of the party workers.” Shivpal was probably hinting at the dent his party candidates can cause to Akhilesh’s Samajwadi Party if the latter fails to form an alliance with the former.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-poll-pact-with-psp-l-will-hurt-akhilesh-even-more-says-shivpal/articleshow/87194396.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Dehradun||Apex body of sadhus in India splits, 7 of 13 akharas form new group||HARIDWAR: In a major development, just a few days before the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) was scheduled to meet at Prayagraj on October 25 to elect the successor of Narendra Giri, the parishad’s president who died last month, seven of the 13 akharas that are part of the apex body of seers, elected the president, general secretary and other office-bearers on their own. The meeting, convened in Haridwar on Thursday, was chaired by ABAP vice-president Devendra Singh Shastri of Nirmal akhara who announced the names of Mahant Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani akhara as president and Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi akhara as general secretary. The surprise move has effectively split the 13-member akhara parishad into two groups. The first group comprises seven akharas — Nirmohi, Nirvani, Digamber, Mahanirvani, Atal, Bada Udasin and Nirmal. The other group has six akharas — Niranjani, Juna, Avahan, Anand, Agni and Naya Udasin. Baba Hathyogi of the Digamber Ani akhara, which is part of the first group of dissidents, alleged that they decided to elect the office-bearers on their own since they were “under-represented in the ABAP body and often neglected in elections.” He added that the seers of most of the seven akharas were “particularly unhappy with the speculations doing the rounds that Mahant Ravindra Puri of Niranjani akhara, who is also the president of Haridwar’s Mansa Devi temple, would be made ABAP president in the meeting to be held at Prayagraj”. Besides, he added, the seers of the group of seven akharas also wanted Mahant Hari Giri, the incumbent ABAP general secretary, to be replaced. Reacting to the move by the seven akharas, Mahant Hari Giri termed the announcement of the office-bearers as “unconstitutional and not valid under any circumstances”. Interestingly, according to ABAP tradition, if a president dies mid-tenure, his successor can be chosen only from his own akhara. Narendra Giri, who had died under mysterious circumstances at Prayagraj, was the head of the Niranjani akhara. Friction between the akharas has been brewing for some time. Earlier this year, three akharas — Nirmohi, Nirvani and Digamber, which subscribe to the Bairagi Vaishnav tradition (unlike akharas like Juna that follow the Shaivite tradition) — had separated themselves from ABAP during the Haridwar Maha Kumbh. They had claimed that ABAP didn’t raise their issues with the state government and mela administration effectively. They had also demanded fresh elections of the akhara parishad within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/apex-body-of-sadhus-in-india-splits-7-of-13-akharas-form-new-group/articleshow/87192277.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Delhi||All in a day: Cop among 3 targeted by snatchers in northeast Delhi||NEW DELHI: An assistant sub-inspector on his way to duty, a woman out shopping and a man returning home all became victims of snatchers in northeast Delhi on Tuesday. In the first case, the 53-year-old ASI's phone was snatched in Gokulpuri area on Wednesday morning. The victim was posted in the police control room unit and was waiting for a bus when a motorcyclist grabbed his phone and fled. Shyampal Singh lives in Ganga Vihar and was waiting for his bus near the Gokulpuri petrol pump. A man on a bike rode up from the direction of Gokulpuri metro station and snatched the ASI’s mobile phone. “He snatched my phone from my pocket and fled towards Nand Nagri," the complainant told police. The accused was not wearing a helmet. The ASI hailed an auto and started chasing the snatcher, but the latter eluded his pursuer. Later, a case under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 356 for assault and use of criminal force and 379 for theft was registered at Gokulpuri police station. In another case on Wednesday, a woman who had stepped out to go shopping became another victim of snatchers. According to the complainant, she took her two daughters and proceeded to Jyoti Colony. When the trio approached Durgapuri Chowk, two men on a Bullet motorcycle snatched her gold earrings and rode away. “We tried to catch them, but they escaped and we could only make a PCR call,” the complainant told the cops. A case was registered in this regard. Meanwhile, in the third incident, 22-year-old man Avdesh Kumar, a resident of Loni in UP, was returning to his home on Tuesday night around 8.15pm. He was waiting for an autorickshaw when he got a phone call. But as soon as he took out his phone to take the call, two youths sped up on a bike and fled with his phone. “They came on a motorcycle and snatched my phone," Kumar said in his complaint. A case under IPC sections 356,379 and 34 (criminal act with common intention) has been registered. According to police data, of the 1,75,327 criminal cases, 3,246 of them heinous ones, registered in Delhi till August 15, over 5,100 related to snatchings and 1,264 to robberies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-in-a-day-cop-among-3-targeted-by-snatchers-in-northeast-delhi/articleshow/87193452.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Multiplexes, theatres to reopen today after 11 months||PUNE: ‘The third bell’ in drama theatres across the state, including Pune, will ring on Friday after nearly 11 months. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has completed work to ensure the upkeep of these facilities. Sanitization and cleaning have also been carried out. Though the reopening of theatres has come as relief for the drama industry, the 50% cap on occupancy is a major concern.  Manager and producer Pravin Barve said the lockdown and restrictions have led to huge financial losses. “The picture is not going to change much financially if there is a 50% capacity limit. The producers will have to live hand-to-mouth till shows are allowed with full seating,” said Barve. According to the producer, conducting one show costs Rs1.5 lakh and can increase to Rs3 lakh or more depending various factors such as the number of actors, production and travel costs, administrative charges and miscellaneous expenses. With 50% occupancy allowed, each show will be able to generate only Rs1.25-1.40 lakh. “Theatre spectators are well aware of the normal rules. So even if full capacity is allowed, there will not be any breach of rules,” said actor Prashant Damle. He further said that by Diwali, the government should allow shows to run at full capacity. “Along with the actors, even backstage artistes have been suffering due to the closure. The issue of their livelihood and insurance should be taken up on priority,” said Sunil Mahajan of Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad, an umbrella organisation of Marathi theatre. Ranjeet Sonawale, a back stage artiste, said the revival is good news, but more and more shows should be conducted. “The life of backstage artistes depends on the number of shows. Payment is given to us per show. If drama activities are allowed to begin at full capacity and speed, it will bring more relief to us,” he said. According to backstage artistes, they get Rs300-500 per show. Monthly remuneration ranges from Rs20,000-5,000 per month. Balgandharva Rangmandir auditorium manager Sunil Mate said standard operating will be followed while holding shows. “We are getting demands to hold shows. They include cultural as well as political events. Social distancing norms and other regulations will be followed. Wearing masks will be mandatory for the audience,” said Mate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/third-bell-to-ring-in-theatres-today-as-curtains-go-up-again/articleshow/87193420.cms||---

Don’t forget Congress took in Navjot Sidhu after he was with the BJP for 14 years. And where did Nana Patole and Revnath Reddy come from if not RSS? And Pargat Singh was with Akali Dal for 4 years!” Amarinder was quoted in a tweet by his media adviser Raveen Thukral. “And what are you doing with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra? Or are you saying Harish Rawat Ji that it’s ok to join forces with so-called communal parties as long as it suits Congress purpose. What’s this if not sheer political opportunism?’ he said in another tweet. “Today you’re accusing me of helping my rival Akali Dal for 4 and a half years, Harish Rawat ji. Is that why you think I’ve been fighting court cases against them for the last 10 years? And why I’ve won Congress all elections in Punjab since 2017?” he said, adding, “You’re apprehension I’ll damage Congress interests in Punjab. Fact is Harish Rawat ji, the party has damaged its own interests by not trusting me and giving Punjab Congress into the hands of an unstable person like Navjot Sidhu who’s only loyal to himself.” Rawat had said on Wednesday, “If he wants to eat crow and go with the BJP, he can. Who can stop him if he can’t stay with his old commitment to secularism? He was considered a symbol of ‘Sarvdharm Sambhav’ and was connected to Congress’ traditions for long. If he wants to go, he should.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-forget-cong-took-in-sidhu-capt-to-rawat-after-secularism-jibe/articleshow/87193431.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man gets 5 years’ RI for sexual assault on minor||MUMBAI: Observing that such incidents curtail liberty of the girl child and need to be curbed, a special Pocso Act court on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a 50-year-old man to five years’ rigorous imprisonment (RI) for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl from his neighbourhood who was out playing on the Independence Day in 2018. The court said that the prosecution has been able to prove that the accused has committed sexual assault upon the child as he put her hand over his private parts. “The victim was below the age of 12 years at the time of the incident, therefore the accused has committed aggravated sexual assault upon the victim. He has also made physical contact with the victim and has made advances involving unwelcome and explicit overtures,” the court said. The court refuted the defence plea that the accused was falsely implicated over a parking row. The court said that accused has not brought any material to show that there was any dispute. It further observed that the dispute was denied by the witnesses. “Moreover, I find it highly improbable that for the reason of parking, future of a 10- year-old girl would be put at stake. It is not the case of the prosecution that incident occurred in the rickshaw owned by the accused. Hence, the fact that rickshaw belonged to other person will not help the case of the accused,” the special judge said. The court also fined the accused Rs 15,000, out of which Rs 10,000 would be given to the child as compensation.  The accused was out on bail. Among the witnesses were the child and her maternal uncle who saw her in the auto-rickshaw with the accused and rescued her. The child told the court that on August 15, 2018 at 4.30 pm, she was playing with her friends. The accused called her, pulled her inside an auto-rickshaw and sexually assaulted her. She also deposed that her maternal uncle came there and saw the accused. In her cross-examination by the defence advocate, the child said that her friends were not with her when the accused took her to the rickshaw. She denied that she was tutored by her mother. The uncle told the court that he was out making a phone call when he witnessed the incident. He said that he inquired with the child and she told him that the accused took her inside the auto-rickshaw. He then asked her to return home and confronted the accused. The uncle further deposed that he informed his sister, the child’s mother, and later an FIR was lodged.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Fund fraud: Recovery of money a challenge for corp||Thiruvananthapuram: The officials handling the internal probe into the alleged fund fraud in zonal offices have a real task at hand as the team is still in the dark about who should be held responsible for the loss of money. This would further delay the process of recovering the amount that has been missing from the corporation's account. The probe team has already confirmed the findings of the audit wing which had unearthed the series of fraud in the zonal offices. As per departmental norms, a memo needs to be issued to the staff responsible and they should be heard before department level action like censure, increment cut or any other measure could be recommended. At Nemom zonal office, the complaints filed by the city corporation with police were mainly against the charge officer and the cashier. However, Nemom police have reportedly questioned other staff who were employed in the period at the zonal office when funds went missing. While the police have now got reasons to believe that there could be more persons involved in the fund fraud, the internal probe by the corporation has not been able to head in the same direction. “With the police arresting some of the accused, a normal hearing process cannot be conducted. As of now the probe has confirmed the findings of the audit wing. The next step is to place the responsibility on officials and initiate steps to recover the money. There are now hints about more people being involved and without any concrete evidence, we cannot initiate department level action against the staff,” a corporation official said. Sunitha, the cashier at the Nemom zonal office, who was arrested by the police, had earlier told officials about how she was forced to sign on a paper which showed that she was solely responsible for all the cash transactions in the zonal office. However, this demand to assume responsibility came up after the audit reported about a loss of Rs 26 lakh collected at the zonal office between 2020 and 2021. With a council meeting scheduled on Friday and protests by the opposition still brewing, Mayor Arya Rajendran may be guilty of letting the strike flare up. The LDF had convened a meeting to discuss the issue only once so far and unlike in the past when senior councillors would mediate with the opposition, the LDF led council has not been keen on ending the protests. While the BJP had taunted the Mayor for her young age and immaturity, the UDF is mounting further pressure by saying that the CPM is using her as a puppet and is not letting her take independent decisions. Such aloofness on the part of the Mayor has created fissures in the council and widened the rift among the councillors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fund-fraud-recovery-of-money-a-challenge-for-corp/articleshow/87169009.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Warring calls Capt Amarinder ‘compromised CM’||Chandigarh: Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Thursday joined the rank of party colleagues launching attack on Capt Amarinder Singh by calling him “compromised chief minister”. Amarinder was compromised by various mafias, including the transport mafia, which took birth during the previous SAD-BJP regime, Warring alleged, adding that his announcement of possible alliance with BJP was “part of this compromise”. The minister said he wanted to “apologise to the people of Punjab that the Congress government could not fulfil many promises” during the last four and half years. He then went on to list his achievements in the last 21 days as the Punjab transport minister. Warring claimed what he has done in three weeks could also have been done earlier, but the former CM “paralysed the system and disbalanced the government”. No other leader in the Congress had remained chief minister of Punjab for nine and half years but despite having got such an honour from the party, Capt Amarinder chose to become not “chief minister” but “compromised chief minister”, he alleged. It was not the Congress, whom the former chief minister was accusing of insulting him, but the people of Punjab wanted him gone, he claimed. Two decades back, people had not heard about any kind of mafia, he said, alleging, “but when ‘jija-sala’ (Sukhbir Singh Badal and Bikram Singh Majithia) came to power, many mafias, including the transport mafia, sand mafia, cable mafia and drug mafia, took birth during the SAD-BJP regime.” The minister said people only know that the Badal family owned Orbit Transport Company but there were many other companies in which they had ownership, including the Taj Transport, Swagatam Transport, Rajdhani Transport, Zing Transport and Indo-Canadian Transport. ‘Income up by 17%’ The transport minister claimed there was an increase of 17.24% in the transport department income. The collection of the Punjab Roadways and PRTC buses was Rs 46.28 crore between September 15 to 30 and increased to Rs 54.26 crore between October 1 to October 15, he said, adding the the daily earning of the transport department was up by around Rs 53 lakh. The tax which the defaulters bus operators had been evading for the last 10 months, had already been collected by them from passengers in the form of tickets, he said, adding 258 buses had been impounded or challaned so far over non-payment of taxes, illegal permits and documents. Warring said that Rs 400 crore will be incurred on the new bus stands and workshops and upgradation of existing ones. The transport minister said that the purchase order for procuring 842 new buses (587 for Punjab Roadways and 255 for PRTC) has already been given to Tata Motors, which would deliver these within 45 days. The recruitment process of around 800 drivers, conductors and other staff had been initiated for these news buses. All the 32 driving and testing tracks would now open on Saturdays too, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/warring-calls-capt-amarinder-compromised-cm/articleshow/87193422.cms||---

---||Goa||Produce passport for bail in drugs case, HC tells foreigner||Panaji: In a significant order, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday directed a Nigerian national to produce a valid passport and visa in order to be released on bail in an NDPS matter, after the prosecution pointed out the modus operandi of several foreigners who deliberately destroy identity documents and then commit crimes. Additional/special public prosecutor Mahesh Amonkar submitted that in the present case too, the applicant, Ugochukwu Solomon Ubabuko, had lost his Nigerian passport. In the backdrop of this, officials from the high commission of Nigeria visited Goa in February 2021. The officials issued fresh passports after visiting undertrials in jail and undertaking biometric analysis. Taking cognisance of the ‘modus operandi of deliberately destroying documents of identity like passport and then committing crimes by suppressing and changing identities’ by foreigners, the high court granted bail to Ubabuko in a narcotics case but directed that he should not be released on bail until he produces a valid passport and visa. “The release of the applicant shall be subject to production of a valid passport and visa. The additional public prosecutor has brought to the notice of this court that online applications can be made in this regard. The applicant will have to apply for the same from jail and in this context, the respondent authorities shall provide assistance to the applicant,” Justice Manish Pitale stated. “But it is made clear that without production of valid passport and visa, the applicant shall not be released on bail,” he added. “Upon the applicant producing such valid passport and visa, the same shall be deposited with the investigating officer. The applicant shall register himself on the basis of the valid passport and visa, with the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office (FRRO) at Goa,” the high court stated. The court noted the prosecution’s concern that in a number of bail applications filed before the high court by foreign nationals, particularly pertaining to offences under the NDPS act, that the accused persons do not have valid passports and visas. “They deliberately carry no papers to ascertain their identities. Most of such accused persons are repeat offenders. They do not disclose their genuine and correct identities and when they are apprehended, they give fictitious names to the investigating authorities, thereby further complicating the cases. As a result, after they are granted bail, it is extremely difficult to ensure their presence to face trial. They also further indulge in criminal activities concerning offences under the NDPS Act,” Justice Manish Pitale stated. Advocates K Poulekar with Y Kotkar represented the applicant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/produce-passport-for-bail-in-drugs-case-hc-tells-foreigner/articleshow/87193453.cms||---

On Tuesday, Congress had announced it would give 40% tickets to women candidates in the upcoming assembly elections due early next year. “I had met some girl students who said they need smartphones for studies and security. I am happy that with the consent of the manifesto committee, the UP Congress took a decision to give smartphones to the girls who pass intermediate and electronic scooter to graduates,” Priyanka tweeted. Priyanka also shared a video clip of schoolgirls whom she had spoken to on Wednesday. One girl said that Priyanka asked them if they had phones to click selfies. “We told her that we don’t have phones and that they are not allowed in our colleges. She promised to announce that girls would get phones and we said that would help in our safety also,” said a girl. “She told us to study hard. We want her to continue interacting with us,” said another student. Later, UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu said successive governments made tall claims of providing a safe and conducive environment to women, but all of them fell flat. Congress is not the first party to promise smartphones. On October 6, ruling BJP announced a smartphone distribution scheme. In an official statement, the state government had said it will give smartphones to students so that they can continue their studies from home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pgv-cong-will-give-phone-scooter-to-girls-if-elected/articleshow/87194409.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Former deputy CM Sachin Pilot said indecent language has no place in politics and Baghel should apologise to the public for his unrestrained statements. Pilot condemned deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore also for using derogatory words for Congress leader Rafique Mandelia. He said ideological opposition is acceptable in politics but using such words not only hurts one's own credibility but sends a negative message to the public. Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, transport minister and Udaipur Congress in-charge, while reacting on the controversial remarks made by the Union minister said he did not only insult the Congress or Gehlot, but insulted the mandate of seven crore people of Rajasthan. Baghel should publicly apologise for his statement, he said. On Wednesday, the Union minister of state for justice and law, while addressing a public meeting in Vallabhnagar, had termed Gehlot as ‘Ghoshna Gehlot’ besides adding, “Gehlot would have been born on the fate of one thousand liars”. Khachriyawas said the language used by the BJP leaders during the by elections campaigns signifies clearly that the party had already accepted its defeat. When a person of the stature of a Union minister is using such derogatory language, one can very well imagine the level of frustration prevailing in the party. For the first time in the elections, the BJP is campaigning without taking the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as they have no achievements to prove. Instead of taking the name of Modi, the BJP campaigners are focusing more on Gehlot and trying to tarnish his image with derogatory remarks. Congress leader Dharmendra Rathod said the BJP first insulted Maharana Pratap, then Ram and now the chief minister of Rajasthan. He said the BJP at the Centre does not have any achievements to prove. Janta Sena Councillor accused of sexualAmidst the Vallabhnagar and Dhariyawad bypolls a woman has accused a Councillor of Kanod Municipal board of molestation. The woman in a petition to the SP of Udaipur accused Prakash Lakhara, a Janta Sena councillor of Kanod Municipal Board of sedating her and making an objectionable video. She has also accused him of exploiting her several times on the pretext of making the video viral. She has also named a teacher who is involved in raping her along with the accused Prakash Lakhara. Considering the sensitivity and timing of the issue, the police are investigating the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/congress-demands-apology-from-bjp-and-baghel-on-derogatory-remarks/articleshow/87193451.cms||---

---||Chennai||Centre denying OBCs thousands of medical college seats: DMK tells SC||CHENNAI: The DMK accused the Centre of depriving OBC candidates thousands of seats in medical colleges by not providing them reservation in All India Quota (AIQ) over the years during which SCs/STs candidates availed the benefits. It urged the Supreme Court to dismiss plea filed against granting reservation to OBC. The AIQ scheme was introduced in 1986 under the direction of the apex court to provide domicile-free merit based opportunities to students from any state to get admission in a good medical college located in another state. AIQ at present consists of 15% of total available under graduate seats and 50% of total available post graduate seats in government medical colleges. Initially there was no reservation in AIQ up to 2007 when 15% reservation for SCs and 7.5% for STs were introduced. Reservation for OBCs was not given and the government has now decided to provide a 27% quota on the direction of Madras high court which passed the order on a plea of DMK. Reservation for EWS has also been notified in AIQ. In a written submission filed in the apex court in the ongoing legal battle for OBC/ EWS reservation in AIQ, the political party said, "The OBC candidates have been deprived of thousands of seats by the Union of India in the previous years. Vide the impugned notice the Union has set right the anomaly for OBCs after a period of 13 years. The granting of impugned reservations of 27% for OBC’s in the SCS-AIQ ( All India Quota seats State contributed Seats) would benefit around 4,000 students this year and would cause a positive domino effect on the society at large". "It was only after initiating contempt petition before the high court by DMK, Union government conceded to the legal fight initiated by DMK, and issued the notice declaring that 27% reservation to OBC in all state contributed seats to All India Quota.  The Union in the counter affidavit filed before the Madras high court termed that granting of reservation as a policy decision even though it is only complying with the orders of high court," it said. The party said that granting reservation is to bring the deprived section to the mainstream and to bring equality. "It is submitted that social justice is a facet of equality which is a fundamental right and policy of reservations is to setoff inequality, bridge the gap between equals and un-equals, remove manifest imbalance for those lagging behind, and remedy the past historical discrimination and injustice done to a social class of people. It is an affirmative action and positive declaration," it said. Opposing the plea for quashing of Centre's notification, the party said that it is not sucking off seats as described by the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centre-denying-obcs-thousands-of-medical-college-seats-dmk-tells-sc/articleshow/87193446.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Road infrastructure has been damaged while crops, too, have suffered losses. “Bridges and roads have been washed away. Some areas have been disconnected and carrying out relief operations in such belts has been challenging. Crops have also suffered major losses. Farmers will be compensated after a survey and assessment,” said the CM on Wednesday. The chief minister’s remarks came after a visit to Rudrapur where he assessed damage from the rains. He also urged organisations and individuals to come forward and provide their assistance to help the hill state. “It’s a double loss for us. We were yet to come out of losses suffered during the first and second phase of Covid-19,” he said. Dhami added that three choppers of the Indian Air Force were in service to evacuate people and restore infrastructure. The state had earlier announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia to the family of those deceased and a financial assistance ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 95,000 to those whose houses have been damaged in the torrential rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-pegs-rain-damage-at-rs-7k-crore/articleshow/87192367.cms||Kautilya Singh

Around 25% of cancers in women are breast. Despite availability of quality treatment for breast cancers, patients tend to get diagnosed after the cancer has progressed to the last stage,” said Dr M Ramesh, head, department of Surgical Oncology, GRH. Doctors stressed the importance of breast cancer awareness and early screening through mammogram. “Such awareness programmes are necessary as even now there remain various myths and misconceptions prevalent among public about breast cancer, including fear of losing the breast in treatment, which leads to delay in diagnosis. This year, we wanted to create awareness among women police officials since they are closely associated with the public and can help spread the message,” said Ramesh. A five-minute awareness video in Tamil was released on YouTube with doctors from various departments talking about the treatment facilities. Around 100 women police officials took part in the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/get-screened-early-to-battle-breast-cancer-doctors/articleshow/87193458.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would have fled to Italy if Covid hit during Congress rule: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: CM Yogi Adityanath on Thursday unleashed a caustic attack on the Opposition, saying had the pandemic occurred during Congress regime, the “brother-sister duo would have fled to Italy” in an apparent reference to Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. Taking on rivals, he said, “Had it occurred during the SP regime, chacha and bhatija (Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav) would have competed with each other to loot resources and Behenji ke samay toh bhagwan hi maalik hota (God knows what would happened under Mayawati),” he remarked. Yogi was speaking at the Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan organised by BJP in Lucknow to reach out to the OBC community. Continuing his diatribe on Samajwadi Party, Yogi said, no one would have dared to open fire at Ram Bhakts on November 2, 1990, had there been a BJP government. “They were ‘Ramdrohi’ who ordered firing at Ram Sewaks for vote-bank,” he said in a clear reference to then SP regime led by Mulayam Singh Yadav. “Jo Ram ke nahi, woh humare kisi kaam ke nahi (Those who do not belong to Ram, do not belong to us,” Yogi said. Stepping up his attack, Yogi reiterated the ‘sarparast’ (supporter) of mafias were rattled by the action taken by the state government.He also questioned a recent meeting between the father of student leader, Umar Khalid, an accused in a Delhi violence case, and SP president Akhilesh Yadav, charging the main opposition party of hatching a conspiracy to destabilize the state government. “Opposition parties can go to any extent. You must have seen who recently came to meet the Samajwadi Party chief. It was the father of Umar Khalid, who says ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’,” he said. Yogi alleged during Akhilesh’s tenure, he ignored children who died of Japanese Encephalitis in Gorakhpur, but had enough time to attend “manglik” functions of party workers. “During the SP regime, 1,500 children died of JE within two months, but the then CM did not have time to visit BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur. He was occupied with auspicious functions of party workers,” Yogi said. He further slammed the Opposition, including Congress, SP and BSP of dividing society along caste lines for political gains and “throwing” the state into anarchy”. “Instead of standing by the poor and downtrodden, they mortgaged the state at the hands of mafias for their own welfare,” he charged. The CM maintained that under his government, mafia can’t “raise” their head or encroach upon property. Conveying a sharp political message, Yogi said, people did have the right to “feel proud” of their caste, but they “should give preference” to nationalism over casteism. “This will usher welfare,” he said at the convention, which was aimed to reach out to the ‘nai’ (barber) sub-caste within the OBC block. Yogi categorically invoked former Bihar chief minister Karpoori Thakur, who belonged to the Nai sub-caste, and termed him a leader who stood for social justice and democracy. The CM said Thakur had to take refuge in Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur when Congress imposed an Emergency in 1975. Yogi said, BJP government under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi was taking steps to elevate the status of backward castes. “The constitutional right given to the OBC Commission was an important step towards empowering backward sections,” he said. He also underscored the “living allowances” given to all sections of society irrespective of caste and religion at the peak of the pandemic. Likewise, the PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana was being implemented to address needs of affected people, he said. The CM said, various schemes were being implemented for welfare of various communities without discrimination. “This was not the case under the previous SP regime in which houses were not given to poor, but SP workers. The poor were not provided toilets or even electricity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/brother-sis-would-have-fled-if-covid-hit-in-cong-rule-cm/articleshow/87194424.cms||Pankaj Shah

Binu, 48, of Ambedkar Gramam in Anappara ward is the deceased. He had gone missing on Sunday afternoon. According to the police, the body was found by the scuba diving experts of the fire and rescue services department around 1 pm on Wednesday. Binu had gone missing in the river when the heavy rains were lashing the district. It is presumed that he might have been swept away by strong current while trying to cross the river in a bid to reach the forest on the other side. On Sunday, he had told his family and friends that he would be going to the forest to collect reeds. A search was launched for him the next day after he failed to return by Sunday night. His clothes and footwear were found on the bank of the river at Vaikkanji following which a search in the river was launched. Binu leaves behind mother, Madhavi.

The scheme which had been functioning under the previous DMK government was recently relaunched by chief minister M K Stalin as it was discontinued by the AIADMK government. In Madurai, 39 medical camps have been planned at the rate of three for each of the 13 panchayat blocks. “Just like the success of ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ scheme which brings medical care at doorstep, this preventive health care scheme will allow public to consult specialists across departments like general medicine, general surgery, gynaecology, ophthalmology, nephrology, gastroenterology etc., and get diagnosed and treated free of cost instead of spending a lot of money for health check-ups at a private hospital,” said Moorthy. The minister said that 25 types of blood tests and five other tests will be done for free under the scheme. Treatment can also be ensured under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme for those getting diagnosed for ailments through the camps. Sholavandan MLA A Venkatesan, district collector S Aneesh Sekhar, DDHS Dr S Senthil Kumar and district programme manager of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs), among others attended the medical camp inaugurated by minister Moorthy at Kathakinaru under the scheme. Awareness on various ailments, treatments and diagnostic methods was created among the public through exhibitions at the camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/multiple-specialists-to-treat-free-at-camps/articleshow/87193459.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nawab Malik targets Sameer Wankhede; latter says min is ‘lying’||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik on Thursday continued his campaign against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, saying that during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, when a section of filmstars was relaxing in Maldives, the family members of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, particularly Wankhede’s sister Yasmeen, were also there. Wankhede himself, Malik alleged, was in Dubai. “I am told even ‘lady don’ (Yasmeen Wankhede) was in Maldives. We have a question for Wankhede. What was he doing in Dubai along with his family during the pandemic?” Malik said, adding it can’t be a coincidence that filmstars and NCB officials were in Maldives at the same time. Wankhede said Malik is lying. “I went with my family to Maldives one-and-a-half months ago, not during the peak of the pandemic. I had informed my (NCB) headquarters. What is wrong with it?” he said. He said he didn't go to Dubai, and his passport is proof for it. “Anyone can investigate,” he added. Wankhede said his sister and her three children had gone separately to Maldives. Malik later posted pictures which he claimed were from Wankhede’s visit to a Dubai hotel. Wankhede responded to that, saying, “Let him prove I was in Dubai. I was on duty in Mumbai. He is the minister. Let him check the emigration, passport and documents. Let him prove me wrong.” Malik claimed he has documentary evidence to establish a huge recovery was made from filmstars in Maldives and Dubai. “We have photo evidence, and we will release it at the appropriate time,” he said. All these allegations are baseless, Wankhede said.  NCB has said Malik has launched a campaign against it as it had arrested his son-in-law Sameer Khan. He was released on bail. Malik’s contention is that even the case against his son-in-law was fake. Malik alleged that after actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, Wankhede was brought in to take on not only leading stars but the film industry. Wankhede told TOI he has been trying for the NCB post since 2019 and was not brought in to take on film industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malik-targets-wankhede-latter-says-min-is-lying/articleshow/87193470.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Madurai||Channel free of encroachment, Trichy collector informs HC||Madurai: Trichy district collector S Sivarasu on Thursday informed the Madras high court that encroachments in a water channel at Polampatti village in the district, were removed by complying with an earlier order of this court. Following this, a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar closed a contempt petition filed by S Thirupathi, a resident of Polampatti in Thenur village at Marungapuri taluk in Trichy district. The petitioner had earlier filed a writ petition seeking to remove the road laid by the block development officer which was encroaching a water channel at Polampatti. A division bench by order dated January 11, disposed of the petition, by directing the collector or the additional collector to pass appropriate orders on the representation sent by the petitioner within eight weeks. Since the authorities had failed to remove the encroachment, the petitioner has filed the contempt petition. During the previous hearing, the government pleader submitted a report stating that the authorities had suspended the process of laying the road. The court observed that while the petitioner has sought for a direction to remove the encroachments in the water channel, the order of suspending the work and cancelling the work order has nothing to do with the prayer sought for by the petitioner. Taking a serious view over non-compliance of the earlier order, the court directed the collector to appear before the court. Sivarasu who appeared before the court on Thursday submitted that encroachments in the channel were removed on October 11. The counsel for the petitioner also confirmed the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/channel-free-of-encroachment-trichy-collector-informs-hc/articleshow/87193463.cms||---

Petitioner S Shanmugam said that a DPC has been functioning in their village, where paddy is the main crop, in the last three years. However, this year, it was not opened and instead at Pudupatti and Karukakuruchi villages nine and seven kilometres away respectively from Pattathikadu. Even when villagers take their produce to these DPCs, preference is given for procuring paddy from farmers in those two villages. Hence, the paddy taken by the farmers gets drenched in rain affecting its quality and thereby denying it a good price, he said. Despite submitting a representation to the authorities, no steps were taken to establish the DPC at their village. A division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar sought response from the state and adjourned the case by six weeks. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/open-dpc-in-pudukottai-village-plea/articleshow/87193473.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Former CM Vasundhara Raje makes condolence visit to Jodhpur, mingles with commoners||JODHPUR: Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje enjoyed the hospitality of a Bheel family enroute Chadi village from Jodhpur and tasted the delicacy of the desert, ‘rabdi’ offered by the family. She also talked to the district magistrate after learning that her host had been struggling for the lease deed of the house, asking the officer to do the needful. Raje had reached Jodhpur on Thursday morning on two days’ visit to offer her condolences to the mother of Union cabinet minister and Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat; and to Mahipal Maderna, who had passed away on Sunday. She first headed straight to the residence of Shekhawat from the airport and left for village Chadi after about half an hour to pay her condolences to the family of Maderna. “On her way to village Chadi, she was stopped by a group of Bheel women, who requested her to accept their hospitality. Not disappointing them, she accepted their invitation. She sat on a charpoy and tasted the local delicacy ‘rabdi’ offered by the family,” said a BJP leader accompanying her. Raje came to Jodhpur after a long time and received a rousing welcome by the party leaders and workers at the airport, despite the directions not to make a huge gathering as she was on a condolence tour. But shrugging off the directions, her supporters converged both at the airport and the circuit house in large numbers, expressing allegiance with her. They also tried to offer garlands to her but she refused to accept them citing the purpose of her visit. She did not disappoint her supporters either and accepted their welcome with humility, asking them to see her at Circuit House, which is a surprising shift as she has preferred to stay at royal palaces during her Jodhpur visit, in or out of power. “She is probably willing to make herself accessible to her supporters and meeting them personally, to assess the political prospects for her,” said a party leader. Raje’s visit after a long time infused enthusiasm among her supporters in the BJP, who wish her to be projected unequivocally as the chief minister candidate in next election, amid the apparent rift between her and Shekhawat, specially with the central party unit promoting Shekhawat as the leader of BJP in Rajasthan. Raje, who has time and again chosen not to be a part of party activities in the state — giving clear impression that she was not happy with what has been going on in the state party unit — has demonstrated by the huge gathering that she is the face of the party in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/raje-makes-condolence-visit-to-jodhpur-mingles-with-commoners/articleshow/87193483.cms||---

India achieved a major milestone in its vaccination programme against Covid-19 as the cumulative doses administered in the country surpassed the 100-crore mark on Thursday. The minister said the aim was to continue scaling up vaccination to cover all the 944 million adults (94 crore) at the earliest. "The earlier supply was 2.5 lakh vaccine doses per day. Now, it has gone up to 40-50 lakh vaccine doses a day. We currently have around 70% first doses and 30% second doses of the vaccine. With adequate availability, the target will be to speed up vaccination in all states that are lagging," she said. "Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Dadar and Nagar Haveli have shown good progress with 97-100% first dose coverage. Big states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are also trying to scale up the vaccination pace," Dr Pawar said. Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla told TOI that the Union government was "very happy" with production levels and that stock levels were comfortable across the country. "We are producing more than 220 million doses a month. India is fully secure as far as vaccine stocks are concerned and things are going well," he said. A Bharat Biotech official said the manufacturing scale had been carried out in a phased manner across multiple facilities in Hyderabad (Telangana), Malur (Karnataka) and Ankleshwar (Gujarat). "The target is to reach our goal of 1 billion Covaxin doses a year. The company is now producing 30-40 million doses a month. We shall touch 50 million by the end of this month," the official said. Bharat Biotech has issued a statement from CMD Krishna Ella stating that reaching the 1-billion mark in nine months was "a remarkable achievement". Bharat Biotech joint MD Suchitra Ella has thanked all academic collaborators, industry partners, stakeholders, suppliers and employees for enabling them to maximise efforts to deliver Covaxin. National Task Force member Dr N K Arora told TOI that the country would have about 90 crore doses available for the programme in the next three months. "There is no shortage. More vaccines will be soon added to the range of the existing ones," he said. The adverse events following immunization (AEFI) during the Covid vaccination drive across the country has been very low so far. A senior state health department official said of the nearly nine crore jabs administered in the state till recently, the percentage of AEFIs reported was just 0.008%, which was minuscule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enough-vaccines-for-all-states-in-next-3-months-minister/articleshow/87193468.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Justice B Pugalendhi observed that necessary circulars could be issued to all the pharmacies referring to the provisions of law and periodical inspections could also be made by the respective assistant controller of drugs to ensure that the tablets containing narcotic or psychotropic substances are used only for medicinal purposes. The court made the observations while hearing the bail plea of a man Jayaraman alias Sony who was arrested by the Pudukottai Town police on March 6. The petitioner was booked under sections of the NDPS Act. According to the prosecution, during a police patrolling, the petitioner was found in possession of five tablets and a syringe which contain a chemical used in painkiller pills. The tablets which contain certain narcotic substances as notified by the central government should be used only for medicinal purposes. However, the petitioner had misused the same. Possession, sale or use of any drug is an offence under provisions of the NDPS Act. The petitioner who was arrested in this case was enlarged on bail by the sessions court on March 22. However, the petitioner had misused the liberty granted to him and was involved in another offence for which another case was registered against him. Thereafter, the bail granted to him was cancelled by the sessions court and he was subsequently arrested on July 30. Justice Pugalendhi observed that though the case was registered in March, the investigation agency has not proceeded further to find out the source from where the petitioner got the tablets. No doubt these tablets are used as painkillers in the medical field, strictly on prescription by the doctors. However, persons like this petitioner are able to get these tablets and use the same drug for sedation. Taking into account the quantity of drugs involved in this case and period of incarceration, the judge granted bail to the petitioner by imposing certain stringent conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ensure-narcotic-pills-are-not-easily-available-hc/articleshow/87193481.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||Aryan Khan bail order: ‘Certifying of chats not necessary at this stage’||MUMBAI: WhatsApp messages which increasingly find their way into hands of investigators can be relied on as admissible evidence only after compliance of law that mandates electronic records to be certified by an official, said the high court of Punjab and Haryana, and Aryan Khan’s counsel had cited it in his bail plea. But not accepting his submission, the special NDPS court said Khan’s case stood distinguished as it was at an investigation stage, unlike the one in Punjab where the probe was complete and a chargesheet was filed. The HC had in a bail order, also in an NDPS case, said that to rely on WhatsApp chats, the prosecution needed the authenticity certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act. When Khan’s counsel Amit Desai questioned the reliance placed by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on the chats it waved to build its case and oppose his bail, the special NDPS judge said he was making such submissions without having an opportunity to go through the material collected by the investigating officer. Desai had said that too -- that the prosecution was relying on material which they were not revealing. But the trial court in its October 20 bail denial order said, “Even if assuming that there is no certificate under Section 65 (b) of Indian Evidence Act at the stage of investigation, it is not necessary.” The court said the HC judgment relied on by Khan’s counsel, where the HC had granted bail by discarding WhatsApp chats in an NDPS case, was distinguishable and hence not applicable to the facts of Khan’s case. In one judgment by the Bombay high court, where it granted bail, though not in an NDPS case, the issue of WhatsApp chats and their evidentiary value at the stage of bail had risen. The case was of rape, and the accused had allegedly made an extrajudicial confession via such chats to a witness, the police had said. Justice Bharati Dangre, however, held that the value of such chats and the extra-judicial confession which by itself is weak evidence cannot be gone into before trial, and had granted bail. Yet another judgment Indeed, though not directly mentioning WhatsApp chats, weighed the value of what an accused says in a statement made to an NCB officer and held that it cannot be treated as admissible evidence. The Supreme Court had invoked Article 20 (3) of Constitution, which is the fundamental right against self- incrimination. The SC judgment in the Toofan Singh case had said, “The phrase used in Article 20 (3) is “to be a witness” and not to “appear as a witness”: It follows that the protection afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in prosecution.” Advocate Ashwin Thool said the protection may well extend to an accused handing over chats to an investigating officer. A US court majority judgment from the Indiana Supreme Court had last year held that forcing a litigant who was placed under arrest “to unlock her iPhone would violate her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.” Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act is a enabling section which allows an electronic record to be introduced as direct evidence through a copy, in a printed form or on a CD, pen drive or any storage device of like nature, in court if the original electronic record itself cannot be produced in court. The section also requires the owner/user of the electronic device to certify that the contents of the copy are same as the original electronic record and that the device having the original electronic record is not faulty or has not been tampered with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-certifying-of-chats-not-necessary-at-this-stage/articleshow/87193502.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rain-hit Kumaon loses 250km of forest land, teams formed in UP to save aquatic life||DEHRADUN/BIJNOR: At least 250 km of forest land has been washed away in the past two days in Kumaon division of Uttarakhand which has seen record-breaking rainfall, according to an estimate by the forest department on Thursday. The data, accessed by TOI, said at least 250 km of forest land running along five major rivers of Kumaon — Gaula, Nandhaur, Kosi, Sharda and Ramganga — has been swept away in the past two days following heavy rain. The rivers flow through Corbett Tiger Reserve, Nandhaur Wildlife Sanctuary and other biodiversity rich zones of the state. A department official said that banks of several tributaries and streams that flow from Shivalik hills were also washed away leading to widespread damage to the existing riverine ecosystem. The department also said that several forest roads — which would measure 600-km combined — were also washed away after the heavy downpour. “The riverine ecology has been hit hard in the disaster. Wildlife habitats have been impacted adversely in the rainfall the likes of which was not seen in over a century. Our preliminary estimates show that losses of at least Rs 30 crore have been incurred,” said the official. The losses were calculated taking into account damage to some natural resources as well as departmental works carried out to protect ecology. “Solar tentacles that were erected to stop wildlife from venturing away from the forests and even walls that were constructed to keep the elephants in their habitats have been washed away,” said the official. Chief conservator of forests, Tejaswini A Patil, added that plantations and soil moisture conservation works like check dams, gullies etc have been hit due to excessive rainfall. Meanwhile, in UP, the forest department has constituted special rescue teams for reptiles that swollen waters of Ganga might carry to the state. According to Bijnor DFO M Semmaran, “Due to the fast flow of water, reptiles like snakes wash away from hills and end up in plains in large quantities. Similarly, ponds, too, get inundated with instances of crocodiles straying into human habitats. We have formed special teams to rescue them.” “We have suggested that residents take precautionary measures. In case a resident spots a reptile, they should inform forest officials. Our teams will rescue the reptile and release it later into a river.” At least 25 UP villages on the banks of Ganga have been alerted. Surendra Kumar of Gauspur village said that every time Ganga is flooded, reptiles invade villages and fields. “Many pythons and crocodiles have been sighted in the area during rains. We are taking precautions,” he said. The water level in Ganga marginally decreased on Thursday but the river continued to flow with 1.27 lakh cusec water, according to the UP irrigation department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rain-hit-kumaon-loses-250km-of-forest-land-teams-formed-in-up-to-save-aquatic-life/articleshow/87192437.cms||Shivani Azad

Life went upside down for her, but she did not give up. She endured surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and went on with her studies to secure the first rank in the MEd examination conducted by the Kerala University. Reethu Mol also holds a master's degree in chemistry. Her family includes her husband, who works as a security guard at the Kims Health Centre, and a 6-year-old son Abhiron R Alex. “I believe God has certain plans for each individual. This disease made me stronger than before. When I was diagnosed with cancer, people started to be sympathetic to me. I do not want that; I am getting the right treatment and care. I do not want this disease to be a barrier to my future. I had no timetable, but I did study on a regular basis, which is why I was successful,'' says Reethu Mol. She got married at the age of 19 to Alex J Glatson, who has been her pillar of support in completing her studies. After her marriage, she finished her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, BEd and MEd, respectively. She was diagnosed with cancer in June 2018. She had to face the third semester exam of BEd at the time of her chemotherapy. The officials of the Victory College of Teacher Education, Olathani, provided facilities for her to attend the exam. She later joined the Government College of Teacher Education, Thycaud, in 2019, for MEd. When she joined for MEd, she got motivation from her family and colleagues. The chemotherapy was held once every two weeks. She was too weak after the first round of treatment. She eventually pulled it off and prepared diligently for the exam. She continues to take her medications and has medical examinations every three months. “I cannot handle too much stress, but I managed to finish my syllabus. Due to the surgery my right-hand hurts when I do some work, it was too difficult for me to write the three-hour exam. I want to be a self-sufficient woman,” says Reethu Mol.  “She was really tired after the chemotherapy, but worked hard for the exams,” says Alex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/even-cancer-failed-before-this-med-ist-rank-holder/articleshow/87169120.cms||---
---||Allahabad||21 Oct Village heads to help beat vax hesitancy||Prayagraj: Finding Covid-19 vaccination exercise unsatisfactory in rural areas as targeted rural recipients are still hesitating to get vaccinated, district authorities have roped in gram pradhans, primary teachers, ASHAs and Aganwadi workers to encourage the eligible rural folks to get them vaccinated in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna rural pockets of the district. For this purpose, a control room has also been set up at the collectorate to coordinate with gram pradhans with an aim to speed up vaccination in villages and blocks. After reviewing the vaccination drive, officials of the district administration and health department found that there was a need to speed up vaccination in rural areas to achieve the target. Later, joint teams of district authorities and health department chalked out a micro plan and engaged gram pradhans and primary teachers to encourage vaccination among rural folks, said a health department official. While the health teams are holding vaccination camps in villages to help rural folks overcome vaccine hesitancy, gram pradhans have also been roped in to dispel misinformation about the vaccine among people. District magistrate (Prayargaj) Sanjay Kumar Khatri on Wednesday told TOI: “We have engaged gram pradhans, primary teachers and ground health workers to boost vaccination in rural areas. Officials are coordinating with gram pradhans and measures are being taken to encourage villagers for vaccination.” “Enthusiasm among eligible recipients is more in urban areas compared to rural pockets. Therefore, we are making sincere efforts to boost vaccination among rural folks with an objective to cover the targeted beneficiaries at the earliest,” he added. The DM also said that “we are also focussing on second dose vaccination among recipients, including government employees, on scheduled time”. District immunization officer and additional chief medical officer Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “Health teams are working overtime to overcome vaccine hesitancy in villages. Now, many departments have been mobilised to accelerate the vaccination campaign, particularly in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna villages. Primary teachers have been assigned duties to register eligible beneficiaries in villages.” The health department has also planned to set up special camps in villages to cover the maximum number of targeted recipients. A health department official said that it is encouraging to note that in the past two months, villagers who took their first jab met others and persuaded them as well as their neighbours and friends to get vaccinated. “Vaccinated people are going door-to-door sharing their experiences post vaccination,” he added. Till now, over 33 lakh jabs have been given to recipients of all age groups while the health authorities have set a target to cover 45.16 lakh recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/21-oct-village-heads-to-help-beat-vax-hesitancy/articleshow/87193489.cms||---
---||Allahabad||HC summons DGP if DNA report is not produced before Oct 25||Prayagraj: Expressing dissatisfaction over the ongoing probe into the suspicious death of a 16-year-old girl student of Mainpuri whose body was found hanging in her school in the year 2019, the Allahabad high court has directed that in case the DNA test report is not received by October 25, DGP UP will have to appear in person before the court. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Mahendra Pratap Singh, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Piyush Agrawal adjourned the case to October 25 for the next hearing. Earlier, on September 16, the court had asked the state government counsel to apprise it of the progress in the investigation of the suspicious death of the girl in Mainpuri district. On Thursday, during the course of hearing, the state government counsel produced a status report regarding the investigation being carried out in the case in hand. The court pursued the report and said that it was not satisfied with the speed of the investigation being carried out. “The report submitted by the state suggests that DNA samples of 170 suspected accused have been taken and the samples have been sent to the laboratory for testing, however, the reports of the same are yet to be received. This court is not satisfied with the speed of the investigation being carried out,” the court said. Thereafter, the court adjourned the matter to October 25, with a rider that in case the report of DNA testing is not received by the next date of hearing, DGP UP shall have to appear in person before the court. To recall, a girl, about 16 years’ old, was found hanging at her school in suspicious circumstances in 2019. Her family had alleged that she was physically assaulted and killed. In the PIL, the petitioner had alleged that the police were not fairly investigating the said incident, rather they have been protecting the actual accused. The petitioner had alleged that the SIT formed for the investigation was not acting independently. The court passed these directives on October 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-summons-dgp-if-dna-report-is-not-produced-before-oct-25/articleshow/87193496.cms||---

---||Madurai||Ancient rock art found inside cave||Madurai: Ancient rock art has been found in a cave at Thumminayakkanpatti near Peraiyur in Madurai district, according to archaeology enthusiasts who stumbled upon it. C Manickraj, assistant professor of history, CPA college, Bodinayakanur, accompanied by a friend K Karuppaiah and rock art expert Bala Bharathi from Trichy had visited the cave in a hillock in Thumminayakanpatti when they came across the paintings. Bharathi said that the anthropic pictographs and animal figurines had been made using herbs and gum. “White and red paintings are common as opposed to the black art found inside this cave,” he said. Manickraj said that the black art showed a line drawing of a man sitting on an animal and another person standing opposite him. This may be the depiction of a war scene, he said. The white drawings are younger when compared to the black drawing from the layering nature of the rock. The white figurines are seen in different postures. There is one figure with both its hands and legs spread out and another has both its hands on its hips, he said. There are figures of animals which look like tigers. The flat nature of these figures makes them look like they were drawn using human fingers, said Manickraj, adding that these coloured drawings could have been made using the soil, some kind of yam or even human blood mixed with it. Bala Bharathi said it is important that such ancient drawings are documented as the cave located near a temple had already been vandalised by the local people which resulted in the destruction of many paintings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ancient-rock-art-found-inside-cave/articleshow/87193487.cms||---

GSAI has urged the government to reconsider the decision and give relaxation for another year DG shipping, in a letter dated October 13, 2021, to the secretary of ministry of ports and shipping, stated that no further relaxation is desirable in this case as it is offence of submitting false certificates. The DG shipping had earlier debarred the candidates for life for submitting fake certificates for obtaining CDC through circular no. 36 of 2020 dated November 12, 2020. However, after receiving various representations from candidates and associations, the DG shipping relaxed the punishment period upto three years. GSAI president Frank Viegas said they have knocked the doors of minister of state for shipping Shripad Naik requesting relaxation of one more year since most of the seafarers who had applied in 2019 will have to wait for one more year. “Our Seafarers are already jobless for almost two years due to the pandemic. It is a matter of livelihood of seafarers.” Most of the shipping companies are insisting on Indian CDC as a mandatory document, whereas CDC is required even for visa application, visa renewal and upgradation of STCW courses . GSAI pleaded with DG shipping Amitabh Kumar also to relax the debarment period to one year as a best solution acceptable to seafarers who are jobless for the last several years for committing the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dg-shipping-not-to-allow-addl-relaxations-for-cdc/articleshow/87202124.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: LDF-II ‘low-key’ swearing-in ceremony cost Rs 87.6 lakh||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Though austerity was the mantra during the time of the pandemic and the newly-elected LDF government had even cut short its swearing-in ceremony, the expense for the event diverged from its aforesaid mantra. Government sanctioned Rs 87.63 lakh for the civil works carried out at the Central stadium in connection with the swearing-in ceremony. As per the order issued in this regard on October 2, the expenses were for setting up the pandal and stage, as per the bills submitted by the chief engineer (buildings) of the public works department. The government had claimed that PWD had spent only one-third of this amount on preparations when the first Pinarayi Vijayan-led government was sworn in at the same venue. In a reply furnished in the assembly on June 28, 2016, the chief minister had replied that only Rs 35,52,894 was spent for the ceremony then, of which PWD bills totalled to Rs 30,86,414. The re-elected LDF government had decided to make the swearing-in ceremony a low-key affair with the participation of 500 persons at the stadium that had a capacity to seat 40,000, in the wake of Covid-19. A petition was then filed in the high court against this decision as there was a ban on congregations due to fears of a pandemic spread. Suggestions were made that the ceremony could be an online affair. Indian Medical Association (Kerala) had urged the government to make it a virtual affair. Even some of the jurists had suggested that the event could be conducted online, as there is no mention anywhere (including the Constitution) on whether the event should be conducted as a physical event. On a petition filed by K J Prince from Thrissur against conducting the ceremony when triple lockdown was in force, a high court division bench consisting of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly had expressed dissatisfaction on the reply furnished by government in court and had sought additional curbs on the event. The government had then announced that it is cutting down the numbers further and the event would be a simple affair with minimal participants. Government has been stressing on the need to maintain financial discipline in every aspect to tide over the acute financial crisis triggered by Covid-19. Finance department had even instructed all administrative departments to recommend schemes and proposals in the next year’s budget by keeping austerity measures in mind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-ii-low-key-swearing-in-ceremony-cost-rs-87-6-lakh/articleshow/87192427.cms||KP Saikiran
---||World||US airlines, White House say vaccine mandate will not impact holiday travel||WASHINGTON/CHICAGO: Two major US airlines and the White House said they do not think the Biden administration's executive order mandating federal contractors require employee vaccinations by Dec. 8 will impact holiday travel or result in employees leaving. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines announced earlier this month they would comply with the mandate that employees be vaccinated by Dec. 8 unless they receive a religious or medical exemption. Some airlines and industry-watchers had initially feared an exodus of unvaccinated airline or government employees involved in travel just before the Christmas season but airlines later said that would not happen and cited comments from the White House this week. Southwest Airlines Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Thursday: "We are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated ... We want our employees to know that nobody is going to lose their job on December 9 if we're not perfectly in compliance." He added: "We're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated." He said the vaccination issue will not disrupt travel. White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients on Wednesday told reporters the vaccine requirements for federal employees and federal contractors would not impact holiday travel. "Vaccination requirements will not impact holiday travel," Zients said. Some lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have raised concerns about the impact on the Transportation Security Administration and travel. "The requirements for federal workers and contractors will not cause disruptions to government services that people depend on. Agencies have the flexibility necessary to enforce the mandate without impacting critical operations," Zients said. Zients added, "the point here is to get people vaccinated, not to punish them. So agencies will not be removing employees from federal service until after they've gone through a process of education and counseling." American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said on an earnings call on Thursday he does not expect any employees to leave as a result of the vaccine mandate. "We think we're not going to see anyone leaving American. I don't think anyone's going to want to leave American because either they choose not to get vaccinated or they don't have a religious or medical (exemption)," Parker said. Parker said the airline is "highly confident" it will have everyone needed to fly its holiday schedule even if some unvaccinated employees with approved exemptions face new testing requirements. "We don't anticipate any operational impact," Parker said. The Cargo Airline Association, a group representing FedEx Corp, United Parcel Service Inc and other cargo carriers, said in letter to the White House on Monday that "it will be virtually impossible to have 100% of our respective work forces vaccinated by Dec. 8 ... Sliding this date into the first half of 2022 will allow association members to meet the demands of the e-commerce revolution during the holiday season." The letter, seen by Reuters, was previously unreported. FedEx told Reuters on Thursday it is "engaged with the relevant government agencies" on the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-airlines-white-house-say-vaccine-mandate-will-not-impact-holiday-travel/articleshow/87195667.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to hear Aryan Khan’s bail application on Tuesday||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday said that it will hear the bail plea of Aryan Khan (23), son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, in the cruise drug bust case on October 26. A day after his bail application was rejected by the special trial court, Aryan moved the HC. He has taken additional grounds before the HC for his bail plea, including denial of allegation of his non-cooperation of any kind in his remand pleas till date, and no claims by the NCB so far that he has not given any names and hence, claiming now that he was not giving names or details of persons is “erroneous and contrary to the record”. Aryan’s counsel Satish Maneshinde mentioned his bail application before Justice N W Sambre and sought a hearing. He said there was nothing found on the 23-year-old and that there was no evidence at all in the case registered by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) against him. The trial court had also rejected bail applications of co-accused Arbaaz Merchant (26) and Munmun Dhamecha (28). While both filed separate petitions for bail before the Bombay high court, Dhamecha’s lawyer Ali Kaashif Khan also sought and was granted October 26 as the date of hearing, after ASG Anil Singh for NCB sought time till then. Aryan’s bail plea states, “There is no presumption in law that merely because a person is influential, there is a likelihood of tampering with investigation.” The bail rejection order of the sessions court had cited it as one of the reasons in denying him bail. The NCB had cited the Bombay HC order in the bail rejection for Showik Chakraborty, arrested last year in connection with the drugs probe linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, to argue a case of ‘conspiracy’ and the trial court had relied on it too, but Aryan’s plea says that the judgment “is not applicable to the facts” of his case “as in that case, the accused [Chakraborty] was allegedly a conduit between consumers and suppliers…and that he was “part of chain of drug deale-rs”, while the allegations against him [Aryan] are “only of possession of small quantity and personal consumption”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-to-hear-aryans-bail-application-on-tuesday/articleshow/87193512.cms||---

Workshops, police stations and the district collectorate are home to many such old vehicles which are no longer in use but continue to remain at the same place for months and years. Lorries which were seized due to illegal operations like smuggling of sand or minerals are parked at the district collectorate. Some are so old that even trees have started growing in them. M P Sankarapandian, a social activist, says these vehicles not only become breeding places for rats but also mosquito larvae after a day’s rain. He keeps sending grievances through WhatsApp to the Madurai corporation’s grievance cell, but many a time they go unattended. ``Sometimes the police come and tell us that the vehicles have been removed but they would have been moved just a few feet away,’’ he said. “Scrap predominantly old vehicles which can hold a lot of clear rainwater in their crevices. Either remove them or drill holes where water can be stored before the monsoons,” said Radhika, a housewife from K K Nagar. She said old vehicles permanently stationed at many of the city police stations are a matter of concern. “When collector S Aneesh Sekhar was the Madurai corporation commissioner, heavy fines were imposed on people contributing to breeding of mosquitoes even in flower pots, but now no such action is taken,” says A Asokan of Bibikulam. When TOI contacted corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said he would look into the matter at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/seized-vehicles-at-offices-turn-breeding-spots-for-mosquitoes/articleshow/87193509.cms||---

The temples body said in a press release that the slotted sarva darshan (SSD) tickets quota for November will be released for online booking on Saturday morning at 9 am. However, the TTD has not clarified the exact number of tickets that will be released for online booking leading to confusion among the devotees. Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on the TTD administration to increase the pilgrim footfall at Tirumala especially after the temple body made the second dose vaccination certificate or a Covid-19 negative test report mandatory for the devotees to be allowed for darshan. At present, the pilgrim footfall at Tirumala is capped at less than 30,000 a day. The average pilgrim footfall at the hill town during the pre-Covid-19 time was around 70-80,000 devotees on normal days.

Following the commissioning of the double track on this section, all up trains (travelling towards Hubbali) halt at platform no. 2, which has been newly constructed, while all down trains (travelling towards Vasco) halt at platform no. 1. However, as there is no direct access to platform no. 2, commuters boarding/alighting trains arriving on this platform are required to take the foot overbridge. However, as the foot overbridge is located at quite a distance, commuters, in order to save time, prefer to cross the tracks thereby risking their lives. As there’s no ramp facility for the foot overbridge, persons with disabilities aren’t able to access the facility, with even senior citizens struggling to get across to the other end. Commuters have now demanded that the railway authorities work out a solution to ease their hardships. “There’s no proper thought given to the design of the redeveloped station building, as a result of which regular train commuters between Sanvordem and Margao are facing tremendous difficulties,” Devanand Bhandari of the Sanvordem-Curchorem Railway Users Association said. He is also a member of the divisional railway users consultative committee (DRUCC) of SWR Hubbali. “There are a large number of passengers travelling on local trains and the railways have given absolutely no thought to their safety and convenience while building the second platform. How are the elderly and those with disabilities expected to get across the tracks? They should either build a flyover or provide lifts and escalators at the Sanvordem railway station.” Devdatt Vasta, who owns a book stall just outside the railway station, agreed. “I often see elderly people trying to cross the tracks with great difficulty as they find it nearly impossible to climb the stairs of the foot overbridge. Safety of passengers should be uppermost in the minds of the railways when they introduce any such major changes,” he said. Sanvordem-Curchorem Rail Consumers Association has also urged the railways to extend the canopy of platform no. 2 for the convenience of passengers. “The newly built shed covers a very small area of platform no. 2. Long distance trains with up to 26 coaches also halt at this platform and passengers have to wait in the scorching sun or heavy rain to board these trains. The existing shed is of no use. Besides, there are hardly any benches for passengers to sit on at this platform. We will soon raise this matter with Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral so that he can take it up with the railways,” Bhandari said. Chief PRO, SWR, Hubbali, Aneesh Hegde, assured that the issue will be looked into. “The stations and facilities have been recently developed for the better convenience of passengers. We will examine the issue, keeping the concerns of passengers in mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poor-design-makes-sanvordem-railway-station-inconvenient/articleshow/87193528.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

They also urged the Union and state government to reduce excise duty on petroleum products. The prices have to be reduced drastically so that the general public, trade and industry can return to normalcy, chamber president N Jegatheesan said. “The rise in diesel and petrol prices underscores the fact that the ruling BJP at the Centre has not heeded to the demands of various trade and industry associations and the general public for the past few months to immediately reduce the excise duty on petroleum products,” Jegatheesan said. The chamber stated that all commodities are currently experiencing a sharp rise in prices due to the rise in fuel prices. As the festive season approaches, the common man would suffer greatly as they are unable to cope with the spiralling price of groceries, edible oils and vegetables due to escalating transportation expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/oil-firms-and-govts-should-cut-profit-on-fuel-chamber/articleshow/87193499.cms||---

In Madurai district, as many as 18,61,964 beneficiaries have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine as on Wednesday. Five wards have achieved 100% coverage with at least one dose. Corporation health officials said that door-to-door vaccination in a targeted manner is being done to ensure 100% coverage in a locality. “In several other wards, around 95-98% Covid-19 vaccination is achieved. At all the primary health centres in the city, healthcare workers have been asked to take up one ward each for door-to-door coverage,” said a health official. Meanwhile, as many as 1,500 camps have been planned for the mega Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday. “We are repeatedly trying to emphasize that Covid-19 deaths and need for ICU beds have drastically reduced now only because of vaccination.  Public must shed any unnecessary fear and come forward for theirs and their families’ benefit,” said an official. In the southern districts, health officials are preparing for the mega vaccination drive on Saturday and efforts are on to improve awareness. In Tenkasi district, a Covid-19 vaccination awareness drive through karakattam, oyilattam, paraiattam, street plays etc by folk artists was held on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-plans-jabs-for-over-a-lakh-tomorrow/articleshow/87193518.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune man catches Delta variant after infection, two Covid-19 vaccine doses||PUNE: Researchers have come upon a 28-year-old healthcare worker from a Pune-based hospital who caught the Delta variant of the coronavirus after he was previously infected with Covid-19, and was fully vaccinated. There have been two other cases of doctors getting infected thrice with the coronavirus. The first was a 61-year-old doctor from Delhi and the other was a 26-year-old medico from Mumbai. After first being infected, the Pune man had moderate levels of antibodies two weeks after recovering when he tested negative. The man then took the first dose of Covishield and subsequently the second dose four weeks later. A month after receiving the second dose, the patient again developed fever and tested positive on the RT-PCR test. Both reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infections seem to be more pronounced in healthcare workers due to their high exposure to Covid patients The research team is from Pune-based Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, and CSIR- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, a part of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG). Dr Vinod Scaria, principal scientist at CSIR-IGIB, told TOI that the study reports an extremely rare case of reinfection after the patient developed hybrid immunity after a Covid infection and full vaccination. He said that hybrid immunity is expected to provide better safety compared to infections or vaccinations by themselves, and hence this case is rare. “Hybrid immunity is supposed to improve B cells and antibodies against variants,” he added. Dr Aayush Gupta from DY Patil Medical College told TOI, “A close follow-up of rare and unusual cases of vaccine breakthroughs as well as reinfections, especially in high-risk front line workers, is necessary.” Dr Shahzad Mirza, microbiologist at DY Patil Medical College, said, “We sent the patient’s nasopharyngeal samples of the post-vaccination episode of infection to IGIB for genome sequencing , where the Delta variant was confirmed.” The research team came across this case in April this year, when Delta was taking hold in India. “One of the other infection configurations we subsequently came across was a patient getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 after the first vaccine dose and again after the second shot,” Dr Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-man-catches-delta-variant-after-infection-2-doses/articleshow/87193520.cms||Neha Madaan

Joshi said this during a meeting with the chairpersons of various committees at the ssembly on Thursday. Stating that the committees are of great significance, Joshi said these panels should effectively deal with the problems of common people. “The committees can play an important role in improving the system as suggestions given by these committees create an effective environment in a democracy. To make the committees effective, changes can be made in the methodology at the level of the legislative assembly secretariat,” said Joshi. Leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said there was a need to activate these committees. “Work which cannot be done in the assembly can be easily done through these committees,” he said. Joshi also launched a 560 KW capacity grid connected solar power plant at the state legislative assembly complex on Thursday. He also reviewed the work of museum construction at the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/committees-not-yielding-expected-results-need-a-change-in-methodology-c-p-joshi/articleshow/87193515.cms||---

---||Nagpur||India-Pak match a ‘mauka’ for theatres to regain audience||Nagpur: For the reopening weekend in cinema halls across Maharashtra, the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match will be one of the biggest draws. Rest of the crowd-pulling may fall on the shoulders of British spy James Bond, with his latest flick ‘No Time To Die’. While advance booking figures in the city are not very encouraging, theatre owners expect things to change fast. One theatre owner said, “Friday will be the first day of operation after so many months, so people will be a bit hesitant. But Nagpur will still see a lot of walk-ins and that will get things rolling. We have to understand people’s psyche too; they want to go to theatres to enjoy. For that you need both, a great movie and the environment.”He added that restrictions on hall capacity, ban on taking food inside the hall and no new big-star Hindi movies for this weekend have all combined for a low advance booking collection. Live telecast of the India-Pakistan match on Sunday is something which theatre owners are confident of being ‘housefull’. “So far, only two national-level multiplex chains have announced to screen the match. Being a Sunday, I am sure many people would love to experience the thrill on the big screen and advance bookings are already shooting up. Of course, with only 50% of the crowd allowed, ‘housefull’ will have a different meaning,” another theatre owner said. As reported by TOI on Thursday, all movie hall owners are looking at the days leading up to Diwali as a ‘dry run’, in which their staff too will get acclimatized to new working conditions. A movie theatre owner said, “Come November 5 and we will have some major Hindi movies releasing. Also, by that time people would have become more confident of visiting movie halls, thus increasing the ticket sales.”Last show timings are somewhat of a grey area, with majority of owners interpreting it as ‘all shows allowed’. A movie theatre owner said, “There is no specific government order which says movie theatres can’t operate beyond this time, which means we are allowed all four shows.” Some have decided to avoid the late night show as it will breach the midnight mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/india-pak-match-a-mauka-for-theatres-to-regain-audience/articleshow/87192472.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Two held for sharing woman’s morphed images||Thiruvananthapuram: The cyber police in the district have arrested two persons, a woman and a man, who created fake social media accounts using morphed images of a woman fuelled by personal rivalry with the complainant’s husband. The police identified the accused as Soumya, 26, of Kanjirampara here and Mibin Joseph, 27, of Udumbanchola in Idukki. The police said that the duo created accounts in Facebook and Whatsapp using the morphed images of the complainant. They even shared those images in the Whatsapp groups in which the complainant’s husband was a member. Following this, the woman and her husband filed a complaint before the cyber police. “Our investigation revealed that the phone number used to create the Whatsapp account was taken using the identity proof of Mibin Joseph,” said district cyber police station house officer DSP T Shyamlal. Subsequently, a team led by cyber inspector Shiju K L Nair set out for Idukki and took him into custody two days ago. It was then the role of Soumya was revealed. He said that Soumya was his chat friend and he helped her by providing a SIM card. He also helped her create a fake account on Facebook using morphed images of the complainant. They had stolen the wedding photos posted on social media for this purpose. Mibin’s arrest was recorded on Tuesday. Soumya was arrested on Wednesday. She told the police that the husband of the complainant owed her money and she took this step after he refused to pay back the amount. Soumya was working as a receptionist at a private homeopathy hospital. Mibin is currently unemployed. He met with an accident a year ago following which he was resting at home. It was during this period that he met Soumya on a social media platform and became friends. Both accused were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-held-for-sharing-womans-morphed-images/articleshow/87169147.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rains, dip in footfall at Char Dham hit traders hard||DEHRADUN: After struggling to claw their way out of financial crisis in 2020, tourism stakeholders expected a brisk business during Char Dham yatra this year. But nothing of the sort happened. Widespread damage caused by heavy rain has dashed their hopes of seeing an increased footfall in the last fortnight of the yatra. Though the yatra to all four dhams -- Badrinath, Gangotri, Yamunotri and Kedarnath -- resumed on Thursday, only 2.12 lakh pilgrims visited the shrines. On Thursday, a total of 16,316 pilgrims visited Char Dham, with the maximum number of 10,750 thronging Kedarnath. Since the start of the yatra on September 18, a total of 2.12 lakh pilgrims have offered prayers at the shrines. With barely two weeks left for the winter break, not a major change is expected in the number of visitors. A trader in Badrinath, Vinod Dimri, said that “anticipating a good footfall in 2021, local traders and shop owners had purchased items in bulk. Like 2020, this year, too, Covid cases surged weeks before the start of the yatra. When things started getting better, heavy rain and subsequent damage have made things even worse.” Dimri asserted that two back-to-back poor seasons have broken the financial backbone of locals. A shop owner in Rudraprayag, Ashok Singh Negi, said the possibility of an increase in pilgrims’ number seems bleak. “The pilgrimage is a source of livelihood for several families of Garhwal. Some of us have taken loans, while there are many who are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Dharmshalas and guest houses, too, are vacant and people associated with the sector are reeling under huge losses,” said Negi. Blaming extended monsoon for making things worse, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said the government has provided financial assistance to people associated with the tourism sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rains-dip-in-footfall-at-char-dham-hit-traders-hard/articleshow/87192464.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 more accused seek bail, claim alleged drug quantity small||MUMBAI: A day after special NDPS court judge V V Patil rejected three bail applications, including that of Aryan Khan’s, he began hearing three more pleas from other co-accused in the same FIR registered by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) following its raid on a cruise ship on October 2. The lawyers of all three accused said since the alleged quantity is small, bail is warranted. Advocate Taraq Sayed, appearing for Manish Rajgaria (30), a guest on the cruise ship, said his client was arrested on October 4 with allegedly only 2.4gm of ganja when the ship was returning from Goa to Mumbai, thus meriting bail. Avin Sahu (30), a jewellery businessperson arrested for alleged consumption on the ship’s return, through his counsel Sana Raees Khan, argued there was no possession. Khan said the “distinguishing feature” was that in Sahu’s case there was “no allegedly incriminating WhatsApp chats” cited as in Khan’s case. Citing Wednesday’s bail rejection order she said Sahu’s case was “on far better footing’’ as the NCB’s submission was that information regarding Khan’s alleged contact with a foreign national was in his “exclusive knowledge” and hence it segregates their roles. The third accused was Aachit Kumar (22), a student studying in Europe, arrested based on Khan’s statement. His counsel Ashwin Thool showed CCTV footage and photogra-phs to argue that the October 6 arrest and seizure panchnama of alleged recovery of 2.6gm of ganja from his residence was “false and concocted”. Thool said while NCB document states that the search and seizure was witnessed by two panchas (independent witnesses), the CCTV footage would show that no panchas arrived or left with the officers. Special public prosecutor Advait Sethna will make his submissions to oppose the bail pleas on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-more-accused-seek-bail-claim-alleged-drug-quantity-small/articleshow/87193523.cms||---

The seamen had been earlier debarred for life by DG shipping for the offence of submitting fake certificates for obtaining the CDC. However, after receiving various representations from candidates and associations, DG shipping had reduced the punishment period to three years. Following the request to further reduce the punishment period by a year, DG shipping, in a letter dated October 13, 2021, to the secretary of ministry of ports and shipping, stated that no further relaxation is desirable in this case as it is in response to the offence of submitting false certificates. GSAI president Frank Viegas said they have approached minister of state for shipping Shripad Naik with the request since most of the seafarers who applied in 2019 will have to wait for one more year. “Our seafarers are already jobless for almost two years due to the pandemic. It is a matter of their livelihood.” Most of the shipping companies are insisting on Indian CDC as a mandatory document, whereas CDC is required even for visa application, visa renewal and upgradation of STCW courses . GSAI also pleaded with DG shipping’s Amitabh Kumar to relax the debarment period to one year as a best solution acceptable to seafarers who are jobless for the last several years for committing the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seafarers-body-seeks-another-cdc-relaxation/articleshow/87202164.cms||---

They had stated in the complaint that the woman – a member of Loka Kerala Sabha and a resident of Italy – had contacted them over the phone and said that Mavunkal’s claims were false. “She informed that Mavunkal had met various high-profile persons through her and that she had ended their friendship when she realized that he was a fraud. She also talked to us about various persons who were tortured by Mavunkal. She asked us to give hints about the matter when we complained and that she would present evidence before authorities,” read the complaint that led to Mavunkal’s arrest. On Wednesday, CB recorded her statement via video conferencing from Italy. Though this was the first time that her statement was formally recorded, she had communicated with the investigators before. It is learnt that CB sleuths had asked her about her association with Mavunkal. Anitha was reportedly a coordinator of Pravasi Malayali Federation (PMF). Monson had claimed that he was one among the patrons of PMF. CB sleuths had collected her statement in this matter, sources said. The woman had reportedly alleged that Mavunkal had initiated a smear campaign against her. Sleuths also recorded her statement about her financial transactions. The issue pertains to the investigation into the financial fraud cases against Mavunkal. He was initially arrested based on the complaint by the six persons, who alleged that he had taken a sum of Rs10 crore after sharing a fake bank account statement and later duped them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monson-case-cb-records-anitha-pullayils-statement/articleshow/87192477.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi Police head constable held for conspiring to get lover’s hubby killed||NEW DELHI: A head constable of Delhi Police has been arrested for allegedly hatching a conspiracy and hiring shooters to get the husband of his lover killed after she began ignoring him. Police said the man died of his injuries on September 16. Initially, two persons who had shot him outside his house in northeast Delhi’s Jyoti Nagar were arrested. But it came to fore that the mastermind was someone else. After a detailed investigation, the head constable, Ghanshyam, was arrested on Tuesday. Police claimed the head constable, who was posted with Crime Branch, was in an illicit relationship with the woman for the past seven years. On September 10, Sudhir Kumar, who had retired as a storekeeper clerk of Army Supply Core, was shot at multiple times while he was sitting outside his house. Six days later, Kumar succumbed to his injuries. The two accused who were allegedly hired by the cop were identified as Chander Mohan alias Bhura and Kunal alias Kuku. It came to light that they were in touch with a police official. The call data analysis of Ghanshyam also showed that he was in touch with them. The woman reportedly started ignoring the cop after her husband’s retirement last year. This agitated Ghanshyam and he hatched the plan to take revenge. “In February last year, Ghanshyam had posted an audio note in the WhatsApp group of his office mates that he will kill or hire someone to kill Kumar,” said an officer. The two shooters were seen near Ghanshyam’s house on the day of the incident, he added. Ghanshyam used his official position to even get the call data records of the woman, the officer said. “On the day of the incident, he had forcefully lodged a non-cognisable report stating that he had lost his mobile phone.” Ghanshyam has been remanded in four days’ police custody. The other two accused are lodged in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/head-constable-held-for-conspiring-to-get-lovers-hubby-killed/articleshow/87193531.cms||---

He zipped in and out of posh localities, prowling for elderly women and snatched their chains,” Duhan said. A resident of Hasanpura in Jaipur, the accused had earlier worked as a labourer and hawker before ventured into chain snatching. As per the police, the accused admitted to interrogators that he specifically moved around localities during early mornings and later afternoons because there were minimal footfalls on roads. The crime branch said the accused sold gold chains illegally and splurged the money to live a luxurious life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-behind-36-chain-snatchings-arrested/articleshow/87194466.cms||---

Pod hotels provide affordable and basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require or who cannot afford larger, more expensive rooms offered by conventional hotels. Western Railways chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, “This unique facility will be a game changer in the way passengers travel in India by rail, especially those on business trips. The pod concept is more suitable for frequent travellers, backpackers, single travellers, corporate executives and study groups.” The pod hotel at Mumbai Central is located on the first floor of Station Building and the rooms will be spread over an area of approximately 3,000 sq ft. The hotel facility will have an inventory of 48 capsules divided in 4 categories — 30 classic pods, 10 private pods, 7 for women, and one for the differently-abled. While both classic and women-only pods can accommodate only one guest each, the private pod will have additional private space within the room. The room for the differently-abled, on the other hand, can comfortably accommodate 2 guests with space for free movement of wheelchair. The pods are compact 6ft x 8ft rooms but offer all the comforts of a conventional hotel room. The pod hotel will provide free Wi-Fi, a luggage room, toiletries, shower room and washrooms in the common area. Moreover, inside each capsule, the guests will have TV, locker facility, mirror, air-conditioner and air filter vents, reading lights in addition to interior light, mobile charging point, smoke detectors and DND indicators. The IRCTC had awarded the contract to Urban Pod Pvt Ltd to set-up, operate and manage the Pod Hotel for nine years. Work on the project began in February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rlys-first-pod-hotel-at-mumbai-central-to-open-by-mth-end/articleshow/87194524.cms||Manthank Mehta

The court said the police can do random checks in restaurants and bars to check if herbal hookahs are being served, but can't keep police personnel posted there as it will affect customers. Justice Rekha Palli took on record an assurance by the police that cops will not park vehicles outside the premises, subject to undertaking by the petitioner restaurants and bars that they will not serve hookahs till a final order comes from court. Meanwhile, the high court was informed that the department concerned for Delhi government has re-considered the August 3, 2020 order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, prohibiting the use of herbal hookah in public places to contain the spread of Covid-19, and the authorities have reiterated that the restriction would continue. The fresh order was passed by the authorities on October 14, reiterating the stand that prohibition on the use of hookah will continue to be enforced till further orders. The court then directed Delhi government to reconsider the matter within five days and in case, they still feel prohibition is necessary, file an affidavit. It listed the matter for further hearing on October 29. The court had earlier issued notice and sought a response from the Delhi government on separate pleas by several restaurants and bars seeking to direct the state and police not to interfere with the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs or take coercive steps against them. During the hearing, the petitioners said the government’s latest order has been passed on the presumption that hookah is being served in closed places and on a sharing basis. The owners said they were ready to make a statement that they will serve it only in open space and disposable pipes will be used in hookah and it will not be on a sharing basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/herbal-hookah-hc-directs-cops-not-to-harass-bar-owners/articleshow/87193564.cms||---

Same would apply for the educational institutions that included teaching and administrative staff. It is specified in attachments sent with our circular yesterday,” Vimala told TOI.Teachers from the government-run college on the condition of anonymity said a majority of their staffers were inoculated with one dose, and a few were without it. “Such teaching and non-teaching staffers are not only putting their own lives at risk but also of the students. Even the government has not made it necessary for them to get compulsorily vaccinated with two doses as they had mandated for entry into temples, malls, multiplexes, and other places. Surprisingly, there is no instruction from the government in this regard,” they said.They pointed out that even a recent notification on colleges reopening by the collector just mentioned that the colleges should conduct the vaccination drive for their staffers “on priority”. “The government needs to think about this aspect seriously, particularly when a few staffers were not ready to take jabs. Even many students are approaching us to allow them to attend the classes without vaccination,” they said, adding that the government should have granted at least a week for the colleges to prepare for reopening.Most colleges reopened on Thursday after confusion was cleared on receiving NU’s notification in this regard late on Wednesday evening. However, the attendance was very paltry. The classrooms were sanitized and students were subjected to thermal scanners at the entry gates to the campus. The guards were also checking their vaccination certificates and masks.Even the students were elated over their first day at the college where they met with their friends after one and half years. “All the rules and regulations were being followed. Every student, staff and members of the faculty were wearing their masks, our temperatures were also checked before entering the premises,” BCA student from SFS College Ayush Kale said.Endorsing him, GH Raisoni Commerce College’s BCCA student Prachi Chandekar said the situation was completely changed as compared to one and half years back. “We all loved the offline mode since we got to meet our friends and acquaintances. Overall, it was a healthy and fun experience as we were eagerly waiting for it,” she said.“We are waiting for students’ consent to attend the classes. However, we will be ensuring that they strictly follow Covid-19 protocol like masks, two doses and 50% capacity with social distancing in the seating arrangements,” Yashwantrao Chavan College of Engineering (YCCE) principal UP Waghe told TOI. Shiksha Mandal chairman Sanjay Bhargava said they started classes in their Bajaj Institute of Technology (BIT) with strict social distancing, but would not be running the colleges in shifts as they had enough space for accommodating all students as per Covid norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-doses-mandatory-for-teachers-non-teaching-staff-for-college-entry-collector/articleshow/87192504.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, while hearing the petition filed by Devendra Singh Adhikari, a resident of Kotdwar, told the official to appear before the court via video conference on October 24. Adhikari, in his plea, stated that the stone crusher does not meet the norms laid down by the Supreme Court, according to which no stone crusher can be installed within 10km radius of the national park, while this one is just over 6km away from the park. Earlier, the government submitted its report, saying the stone crusher is 13km away, following which, the petitioner urged the court to conduct an aerial survey to measure the exact distance. The stone crusher does not even meet the PCB guidelines, the petitioner said. It also poses a threat to animals and therefore, its operations should be banned, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/specify-distance-between-stone-crusher-rajaji-hc-tells-forest-official/articleshow/87192499.cms||---

The accident occurred at 6.30am when the ambulance travelling at high speed crashed into a truck from behind, killing the patient, Prakash Naik, before reaching Goa Medical College (GMC). The ambulance was transporting the patient from Betki primary health centre. Two other individuals — medical attendant Vikas Talekar and the patient’s relative Ravi Naik — who were accompanying the victim in the ambulance, sustained injuries and are undergoing treatment at GMC. The patient’s child, who was also in the ambulance, was unhurt. After the collision, the front portion of the ambulance was completely damaged. The driver was not injured in the accident as he was wearing a seatbelt. PSI Viraj Dhauskar, who is investigating the case, said the ambulance driver admitted that he was speeding and slammed the vehicle into the truck from behind as visibility was poor due to foggy weather. The matter is under investigation. Old Goa police arrested the 34-year-old ambulance driver, Neetesh Naik, from Keri-Sattari and have filed a case under Sections 279, 337, 338 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code. The PSI said that the ambulance driver could not provide any details about the truck’s description or registration number.

Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has directed the solid waste department to take measures to clear the spots. NMC has set a deadline of one month to make the city free of these black spots. Officials from the NMC’s solid waste department said they have already cleared three black spots by creating awareness among people. “We have successfully removed three black spots — one at a location near a petrol pump at Dwarka, another on Amardham road in Nashik East and one more near Vakilwadi area,” said NMC officials. Officials said that they are also ensuring that the waste dumped at the black spots is lifted by the garbage van. “We had deployed a guard in civil dress to keep an eye on those dumping garbage in the open and to convince them not to do so,” said the officials said. Officials said that after the residents complained about the timing of the garbage vans, the timing of the van visits were changed. “Some of the residents are out through the day either for work or business. Accordingly, we changed the timing of garbage vans. We also created awareness among people, appealing to them to use garbage vans. This yielded good results and we could reduce three black spots in the last two weeks,” said officials. Officials said over 200 garbage vans have been deployed across six divisions to collect household waste from the residents at their doorstep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-finds-100-illegal-garbage-dumping-spots/articleshow/87191572.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||UK strike group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth to bolster ties with India||MUMBAI: United Kingdom’s Carrier Strike Group (CSG), which is stationed for seven days in the Arabian sea, is likely to play a key role in widening the trade and diplomatic ties between the UK and India in the Asia-Pacific region. The CSG and Indian Navy will also carry out joint exercises. The flagship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is the first aircraft carrier in the world designed from the outset to operate fifth generation combat aircraft. The 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth (RO8), built over an area of 4.5 acres, has a capacity to carry up to 40 aircrafts, including F-35B lightning strike fighters. It was commissioned in December 2017, and can accommodate 3,500 people. Commodore Steve Moorhouse, commander CSG, interacted with journalists onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth on Thursday. He said they will be hosting members from industry, science, technology, trade and industry in the next couple of days as part of a friendly relationship between India and UK. The CSG comprises dozens of helicopters, Royal Navy warships and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries. The joint exercise by the UK and India comes a week after the second phase of Malabar exercise, 2021. The quad countries; the US, India, Japan and Australia, carried out a joint exercise last week, and sent out a message about working together and closer in the Indian Ocean region. The HMS Queen Elizabeth has been sailing for the last five months. While it seems that the UK is trying to push back China and Russia, commodore Moorhouse said, “I don’t think we are the answer. I think the answer is peaceful negotiation. It has always been and will always be,” said Moorhouse. The strike group can move, act and fight as an integrated and cohesive force, even when spread out across thousands of miles, but individual ships are able to detach from the main group to conduct independent or concurrent tasks as required. “Our exercise with the Indian military is the biggest exercise we have done with India. It’s not very often that as a nation you are exercising maritime, land and air at the same time. These are the early signs of where we want to go,” Moorhouse added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uk-strike-group-led-by-hms-queen-elizabeth-to-bolster-ties-with-india/articleshow/87193534.cms||Mateen Hafeez

If the recommendations are accepted by the CDC's director, who could sign off on the guidance as early as later on Thursday, the agency will align with the US Food and Drug Administration's authorization US FDA clears Moderna, J&J Covid-19 boosters, backs use of different vaccine for boost on Wednesday for the additional boosters and "mix-and-match" dosing. That could pave the way for the extra shots to become available immediately afterward to millions of Americans. Still, health officials and public health experts said the booster rollout could be confusing. The panel struggled with trying to make the language of its recommendations as clear as possible, and also offer flexibility for patients to get a vaccine of their choice. "A really important aspect of all of this is being clear and not dancing on the head of a pin, so that we don't further confuse the American people," said Dr. Beth Bell, a panel member and clinical professor in the department of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle. The recommendations also open the door for recipients of the one-shot J&J vaccine to get a dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that have been shown to afford greater protection in a variety of studies. Although these vaccines have been highly effective in preventing serious illness and death, some government scientists have suggested that boosters are needed to keep immunity high, especially as the extremely contagious Delta variant of the virus can cause breakthrough infections among some who are fully vaccinated. ACIP voted to recommend booster doses for everyone 18 and older who received a first dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine at least two months earlier. For those who received their second dose of Moderna's vaccine at least six months earlier, ACIP recommended a third shot for those age 65 and over, as well as some individuals at risk or severe illness and those at high risk of exposure to the virus through their jobs. Dr. Helen Talbot, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University and a panel member, said she voted for the recommendation, but cautioned, "Moderna has very good vaccine efficacy. There will be some confusion with the higher versus lower dose." Booster doses of the Moderna vaccine will be 50 micrograms, half the strength of the original shots. "Those not at high risk should be really thoughtful about getting the higher dose. I do think we need to be very aware of potential complications." Experts said communicating those risks could be an issue, especially given the flexibility of allowing people to choose a different vaccine from their original series. "At the end of the day, even that phrase 'mix and match' pretty much gives people the latitude to ... do pretty much anything," Glen Nowak, a risk communication professor at the University of Georgia and former communications director for CDC’s National Immunization Program said after the meeting. "I think that's going to be an issue." The FDA and CDC previously signed off on booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE for the same groups included in the Moderna recommendations. Pfizer released data on Thursday suggesting that a booster dose was highly protective for those age 16 and older compared with protection nearly a year after receiving the two-dose regimen due to waning efficacy over time. About 11.6 million people have so far received a booster dose, according to data from the CDC https://Covid.cdc.gov/Covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin- rate-total. The FDA and CDC have been under pressure to authorize the additional shots after the White House announced plans in August for a widespread booster campaign. Other countries such as Israel have begun offering boosters to a broad population, but it is not yet known whether the United States will follow suit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-cdc-advisers-back-moderna-jj-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-mix-and-match-shots/articleshow/87195694.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Girl child murder: Lens on ‘family pressure’, cops to question dad||KOLKATA: A day after the arrest of a 21-year-old woman for allegedly smothering her one-day-old girl at a private nursing home, the police have decided to question her husband Ajay Singh to check if he had forced her to commit the crime. The development came after the woman, Lovely Singh, claimed that ever since her marriage about 18 months ago, she had been pressurized to bear a male child. Police said they will ask other family members to join the investigation to ascertain if indeed there was any family pressure as claimed by Lovely. The cops are also checking the statement by Ajay on his whereabouts between 12.30am and 5.30am on the day of the crime. Lovely was produced at the Alipore court on Thursday, where she was sent to police custody till October 25. Public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal said the pillow used to smother the newborn had been recovered. The incident has left the city shocked. “These extreme decisions are taken when the mother believes that a girl child will be a burden. However, when the societal pressure will wear off and she will find she stands at the wrong side of the law, she is bound to break down. These cases might be rare but they show how society still treats the girl child,” said sociologist Prasanta Roy, the former head of political science and sociology departments of Presidency University. “This can be an extreme case of postpartum psychosis. We need to know if she was suffering from other depression before her pregnancy. It can be due to rapid hormonal changes on the organic part. The psychosocial reasons behind such action, too, can be many and vary from person to person. She might think the baby might bring ill luck to her or she might believe she might now get less attention. Only after studying her clinically can the real reason be established. In such cases, it is best to access the mental condition of the mother and bring the baby near her only during breast feeding and under guidance from hospital staff,” said psychiatrist Sagnik Mukherjee. “The act of killing one’s child seems very unthinkable to many, as it might be impossible to understand why a mother would kill her own child. This type of reaction is very often observed when neonaticide (the killing of a child within the first twenty-four hours of life) takes place, as in this case,” said Pritha De, a psychologist. Studies have documented that neonaticide is committed mostly by very young females who are single, live with their parents or caretakers and in majority of cases deny having become pregnant. As a matter of fact, research shows that over 95% of newborns killed during the first 24 hours were not born in hospitals. But in this case none of the characteristics match. Police said the accused’s husband Ajay stayed back in the twin share cabin on Tuesday night. “He claimed that he fell asleep after midnight and had stepped out for tea early in the morning. When he returned, he learnt from a caregiver and a nurse that his baby had died,” said an investigator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/girl-child-murder-lens-on-family-pressure-cops-to-question-dad/articleshow/87192536.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The boy succumbed to injuries in a hospital on Wednesday. SHO of Salasar, Sandeep Kumar, said that the police arrested the accused Manoj and started an investigation. According to police, the boy’s father, Om Prakash had filed an FIR alleging that his son Ganesh Sharma died due to the beatings of his teacher Manoj inside the classroom on Wednesday morning. An official told TOI that the teacher had first reprimanded Ganesh for not completing the homework. “We spoke to other students who claimed that Manoj forcefully struck at Ganesh’s back. The student fell unconscious on the floor. We spoke to doctors who said that the boy was already physically very weak. While there were no major wounds on his body, the doctors suspect internal injuries including damage to the boy’s ribs and liver, leading to his death,” an official told TOI on the condition of anonymity. The incident sparked off a wave of anger and grief in Kolasar village in Salasar. Several leaders condemned the incident and demanded a swift probe into the case. The minister for school education on Wednesday had directed officials to cancel the school’s affiliation. Family members had alleged that the same teacher had been assaulting Ganesh for the past 15 days, police, however, claimed that it would be corroborated in the investigation. “We had detained the teacher immediately after the FIR was filed against him. The medical board conducted the post-mortem and the body was handed over to the family for cremation. Everything else is a matter of investigation, including the fact that whether the teacher was a relative of the school owner and meted out the same treatment to other students,” an official claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/teacher-held-for-beating-teen-to-death-in-churu/articleshow/87194476.cms||---

Vihang Shah, a resident, said that there has been an increase in garbage in and around Baner in the past few days. “There are public places where garbage has been dumped for the past six months. Then, there are places where garbage is not being cleaned regularly. When we asked the local PMC staffers, they said there was some problem at the plant,” said Shah. An official at the Aundh-Baner ward office said that due to problems in solid waste management plants, only 50% of the garbage is being collected daily, leading to the pile-up. However, Ajeet Deshmukh, head of the department of solid waste management, Pune Municipal Corporation, said that all plants are working fine. “There has been a problem with the vehicles that come to pick garbage in our area. Earlier, they would come 3-4 times a say. Now, they come only once or twice. The staffers said they are unable to unload all the garbage collected due to problems there, and hence only 50% of the garbage is being transported every day for the past 4-5 days,” a ward official said. Deshmukh, however, denied that there are any problem at the plants where the PMC dumps its garbage. “All processing plants are working fine. The city generates about 2,500 metric tonnes of garbage, daily. There could be a possibility of some communication gap due to which the garbage could not be picked up. However, if the residents tell us the exact locations, we will send the vehicles and get them cleaned within 24 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garbage-piles-up-in-baner-ward-office-cites-problems-in-plants/articleshow/87193604.cms||Ardhra Nair

In the third cutoff list, which was released by the varsity recently, several categories across courses saw “no applicants” and no cutoff marks were declared. Senior varsity officials said that the courses did not have any applicants left due to which the cutoffs were not released. “For some of the courses, we have exhausted all the applicants in certain categories. The concerned department is considering opening the respective courses under a special drive, which is most likely to take place at the end of the admission cycle. For such a drive, the admission process is most likely to reopen so that aspirants can apply,” a senior AUD official said. Under the third cutoff list, BA (H) global studies saw no applicants under the unreserved, OBC, ST and EWS categories for outstation students. Similarly, for BA (H) sustainable urbanism, the varsity exhausted the list of applicants for the OBC, SC, ST and EWS categories for students from outside Delhi.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: On 100 crore day, gloom over falling vax numbers; fests make last mile tougher||MUMBAI: The day India’s vaccination drive hit a billion doses, health officials in Mumbai and Maharashtra confronted a grim fact: a sluggish pace of vaccination compared to the last two months. In September, 29.5 lakh people — the highest monthly turnout in the city — got vaccinated against 21.4 lakh in August. BMC data shows that in October (till 17th), only 11.2 lakh took the vaccine. “There is no denying that there is a drop in vaccination, but it is mainly due to the festive season,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The vaccination drive began in January with long queues and up to six hours of waiting at public centres offering free vaccination. During stockout in the months of May and June, queues at some centres began in the wee hours of morning. According to a comprehensive report released by the BMC health department on Thursday, an average of 1,300 people were vaccinated daily in January and it increased to 6,000 in February. It jumped to 31,000 in March and 42,000 in April. The daily average dropped to 28,000 in May due to stockouts, but rose to 70,000 in June and 57,000-plus in July. The BMC now has lakhs of doses in stock, but takers are fewer. On Thursday, the turnout was below 50,000 (49,516) — a far cry from the over 1.5 lakh turnout on some days in September. A doctor in charge of a BMC centre said the “sluggish” pace is due to hesitancy over the second shot. According to CoWIN, the city’s first-shot coverage is 97% and second shot 56%. “We are at the tail end. It will take effort to get to 100% coverage,” said Kakani. The BMC has introduced mobile vaccine centres to improve coverage. “The second-shot beneficiaries may return after Diwali,” he added. Across the state, too, it has been weeks since a turnout of over 10 lakh was registered. The initial run of Mission Kavach Kundal only saw 50% of the anticipated 1 crore taking the shot. Health minister Rajesh Tope said vaccine supply has streamlined in the state, but the challenge is now to get the remaining 30% who have not taken their first dose to the booth. In another vein, he pointed out Maharashtra contributed handsomely as the country notched up 100 crore vaccinations on Thursday: 6.4 crore people in the state have got first doses and 2.9 crore have got second doses. “The festive season has begun and people feel there is no hurry to get vaccinated as the cases are low. Covering this last mile population will be the most challenging, we have to reach out to them, counsel them to come to the centres,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-100cr-day-gloom-over-falling-vax-nos-fests-make-last-mile-tougher/articleshow/87193608.cms||Malathy Iyer

Solar energy happens to be the cheapest form of renewable energy and people are showing renewed interest in buying solar power units. Andhra Pradesh government had been promoting solar energy on a big scale till 2020. Government provided subsidies on agriculture solar pump sets which received a huge response from farmers. Majority of educational institutions and government offices installed solar power units with net metering systems. “Solar is the best suitable renewable energy generation system for our region. We will witness around 285 sunny days per annum on an average. Every household can generate electricity by installing solar panels at their homes. But people ignore them considering the high investment and maintenance,” said M Ravi Kumar, a retired divisional engineer at APSPDCL. The situation is slowly changing with the proposed power cuts, coal shortage and power tariff hike. Enquiries for on grid and off grid solar power units have increased in the state from October 1, say traders. “The demand for solar units increased by 25 per cent after October 1. A 3 KW unit can generate up to 12 units of power. The production further increases in summer. We have sold around 14 units so far this month while we sold only 3 units in September,” said Md Ismail, a solar panel trader in Jawahar Autonagar in city. Incentives from the government in the form of subsidies will help boost the sales and we also urge the governments to create awareness campaigns, he added. People should not have wrong conceptions on costs as one can get the investment back within four years of installing the unit,” said P Bhagavan Narayana, an environmental lover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/25-jump-in-demand-for-solar-power-units/articleshow/87192554.cms||Venu Lanka

Six children, 11 women and 16 men who were rescued were shifted to a safer place. This is the third incident of a building collapse in the past three weeks in the Burrabazar belt. Four people, including a child, were killed in Ahiritolla and Rabindra Sarani earlier this month. KMC had reportedly asked the tenants of the building to move out but the requests were ignored. “The tenants continued to stay at the rickety building despite our repeated warnings,” said a KMC official. “Around 11.55pm on Wednesday, the iron staircase along with a portion of the second floor roof measuring 15ft×12ft collapsed at 12 Pathuriaghata Street. No report of injury has been reported so far," said a police officer. A seven-member DMG team used multiple ladders, concrete cutters, hydraulic hammer drills and metal cutters to rescue the trapped. “It was a narrow escape for the residents. The DMG personnel and fire services department did a commendable work,” said a KMC buildings department official. KMC engineers inspected the site and ordered demolition of the remnants that would pose a threat to pedestrians. “We will need to demolish parts to ensure safety of pedestrians and the residents of adjacent buildings,” said a KMC buildings department official. Anticipating collapse of more buildings in the Burrabazar area, KMC has started demolishing insecure parts of several buildings. “We have demolished portions of several buildings at Cotton Street and Rabindra Sarani. We will need to demolish some such structures in Pathuriaghata too,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/33-rescued-after-house-collapse-in-pathuriaghata/articleshow/87192567.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Fake currency amounting to Rs 99 lakh seized, 6 held||COIMBATORE: The rural police on Thursday arrested a six-member gang for cheating two people of Rs 25 lakh by luring them to invest in a ‘rice pulling’ scam. The arrested were identified as S Murugesan, 36, from Kinathukadavu in Coimbatore district, M Raj alias Bojaraj, 42 from Ilango street at Udumalpet in Tirupur district, D Dineshkumar, 34, from Vellore, R Suryakumar, 24, from Aranthangi near Ranipet, B Senthilkumar, 41, from RS Puram and M Venkatesh Prabhu (26) from SITRA in Coimbatore district. The gang approached the victims, A Abdulkalam, 44 and E Mahadeep, 58, from Kozhikode, through another agent Shaji of Kerala. By claiming that the ‘pot’ they were in possession of is made of iridium and a ‘rice puller’ and worth crores of rupees in the international market, the gang promised Abdulkalam and Mahadeep that they would get crores of rupees in return if they buy the pot. Believing their words, Abdulkalam and Mahadeep sold their gold ornaments and borrowed loans from several people. They handed over Rs 25 lakh to the gang. “The gang claimed that the amount was collected from the duo for the expenses of buying a protective suit, oxygen cylinders to handle the iridium and some equipment to test the power of iridium. The gang members also acted in different roles to con the duo,” Coimbatore district superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam said. While Murugesan posed as a tribal man and claimed to be in possession of iridium, Bojaraj acted as an agent, Dineshkumar an expert to assess the power of iridium with the help of Suryakumar. Senthilkumar and Prabhu acted as bouncers to protect the gang members. “Abdulkalam and Mahadeep were taken to a rental house at KG Garden near Othakkalmandapam on Wednesday, where one of the gang members acted as if testing the iridium by wearing a special suit,” Selvanagarathinam said. When the duo smelt a rat, they asked the gang members to produce documents to prove the authenticity of the metal. However, the gang gave a few bundles of currency notes to the duo and asked them to leave the place immediately. The duo learned that it was counterfeit currency notes. When questioned, the gang members attempted to assault Abdulkalam and Mahadeep. Police said the duo managed to escape and informed the SP. A special police team nabbed the gang. Police also seized a copper pot, two oxygen cylinders, a knife, Rs 99.2 lakh counterfeit currencies and two cars from them. The arrested were remanded in judicial custody on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fake-currency-amounting-to-rs-99-lakh-seized-6-held/articleshow/87192571.cms||---

They urged him to revise the design of the 70-year-old Uppilipalayam roundabout, which is causing traffic congestion in the city. The Ukkadam flyover project has been dragging for over five years and it should be completed to ease traffic towards Palakkad and Pollachi.“Frequent accidents are occurring on Mettupalayam Road due to lack of proper service roads. The ongoing flyover work at four places needs to be completed at the earliest to avoid such accidents,” the memorandum said. “The local body has retrieved large parcels of land in the water bodies like Krishnampathi tank, Muthanan, Periyakulam and Valankulam that were encroached. While these lands are being used for the smart city project, they should be used to expand water storage capacity of the lakes. Concrete should not be used to strengthen bunds of lakes as it may disturb the ecosystem of the wetlands.”The members stressed on restoration of Noyyal River as unchecked discharge of effluent into the river is resulting in contamination of groundwater. They stressed on building effluent treatment plants to prevent pollution. They also sought steps to increase water retention capacity of Siruvani dam by desilting catchments areas and feeder channels.Development of Salem- Coimbatore industrial corridor will connect four western districts while inviting industries and investors to set up units, the memorandum said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/expedite-infrastructure-projects-in-western-dists-kongu-global-forum/articleshow/87192565.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Time mgmt key to high MCQ scores: Teachers||Kolkata: The first semester examinations of CBSE and CISCE boards that will be based on multiple-choice questions (MCQ) will be helpful to students who are finding online-based teaching in the Covid year challenging, but they will need to learn how to manage time well and quickly select the correct answers, schoolteachers said. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to conduct the class X and XII examinations in the MCQ format, and term 1 will cover 50% of the syllabus. CBSE will use a combination of intelligent character recognition (ICR) and optical mark recognition (OMR) techniques to evaluate students’ performance in the MCQ pattern and the subjective part will be held next year in March-April. According to principals and teachers, the new pattern will be more student-centric, transparent, technology-driven and future oriented. Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), too, has decided to go the same way. Students will have to answer multiple-choice questions for 40 to 80 marks, depending on the subject. Sujay Biswas, principal of Rammohan Mission High School, affiliated to CISCE, said, “The council has arranged a series of training sessions for teachers to guide them about new patterns and had sent specimen questions after declaring the decision, which was very helpful for the students to understand the question pattern. We have distributed the sample questions among students and have arranged a few mock tests so they can learn how to tackle the new system.” Case-based MCQs have been introduced in the examination and most of the teachers said the main objective of this format will be to test the analytical power of students. Moreover, in the MCQ pattern, students have to provide reasoning, which will help them tackle competitive examinations in future. Jonaki Mukherjee, a teacher of social sciences at DPS Ruby Park, affiliated to CBSE, said, “Students can score good marks and they have adopted the new procedure. But we had to work hard to prepare them. We took many tests following the new pattern, so that students are well prepared to take the examinations. However, the OMR sheet is not new for students who have sat for the Olympiad.” Tanusree Banerjee, a science teacher of a CISCE-affiliated school, said, “The MCQ pattern saves a lot of evaluation time. Moreover, using technology for evaluation, hopefully, will help us a lot.” CBSE has published the date sheet for term 1 for classes X and XII and major subjects’ examinations will start from the end of November while CISCE has pushed back the first-semester examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/time-mgmt-key-to-high-mcq-scores-teachers/articleshow/87192583.cms||---
---||Mumbai||October testing dips in Maharashtra; Mumbai steady, runs over 61% RT-PCR||MUMBAI: Even as Covid testing drops across the state, the city has managed to stay steady between 30,000 and 35,000 tests on most days. Till October 17, 3.7 lakh RT-PCR tests have been done along with 2.3 lakh rapid antigen tests (RAT). In fact on September 21, Mumbai completed 1 crore tests, with almost 65% using the RT-PCR method that is considered the gold standard for testing Covid. In September, 6 lakh tests were done using RT-PCR and another 4.9 lakh were RAT. Concerns are being voiced about the drop in testing across the state in the last two weeks. From an average of 1.9 lakh tests a day during the peak of the second wave between April and June, daily tests have dropped to 1 lakh at times. State officials said people are unwilling to get tested during the festive season, and the ebbing second wave is lulling people about the menace of Covid. “We too had fewer people wanting to get tested during the Navratri festival,” said a senior BMC official, but testing has stayed within the 30,000-35,000 daily range. “We carry out targeted testing instead of randomly testing people. Moreover, we try to follow the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines to carry out 70% of the daily tests using RT-PCR,” he added. While the RT-PCR test positivity in the city is around 2%, the positivity rate for rapid antigen tests is down to 0% on most days. In the state, the number of tests has dropped by 10% in the last one week: while 7.7 lakh tests were conducted between October 8 and 14, the number dropped to 6.9 lakh between October 15 and 21. “Maharashtra has a potential of conducting nearly 2 lakh tests every day and districts have been advised to continue to test more people to keep the spread in check,” said health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-oct-testing-dips-in-maha-city-steady-runs-over-61-rt-pcr/articleshow/87193631.cms||---

The process will kick-off once the health department receives the doses. “The targeted group of children up to 17 years in the state who are eligible for vaccination is around 1.10 crore. We have completed preparation for inoculation of eligible children. We have sufficient storage, cold chain and trained manpower,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. He said that once the state receives the vaccine doses for children, the health department will create awareness so that people should know that children will be completely safe with the vaccine. Infusing confidence among people for vaccinating their children, Sharma said when a child takes birth, he gets vaccinated against diseases. Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has given approval for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Zydus Cadila for vaccinating children from 12 years to 18 years. “In the state, children will get ZyCoV-D, which is a Zydus Cadila vaccine,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, project director (vaccination), health department. Children are not yet protected against Covid-19 since they have not received any vaccine yet. The schools have also opened for children and they have to go out for studies. Health department officials said that Covid-19 vaccine will provide protection to the children. The apprehensions are still looming large of third wave of Covid. The state government is making preparation for third wave and covid vaccination is important for avoiding spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-awaits-doses-to-vaccinate-children-in-12-17-age-category/articleshow/87194570.cms||---

The list published on October 19 has JU with 29 scientists in the top bracket, ahead of Benaras Hindu University with 24 scientists, University of Hyderabad with 22 scientists and Delhi University with 18 scientists. The leading institute from India is IISc Bangalore with 114 leading scientists on its rolls. JU VC Suranjan Das said, “I am really feeling proud that my colleagues have got international recognition. They have made not only made Jadavpur University proud, but Bengal as well. I hope after this recognition, UGC will reconsider the appeal of bringing back the status of Institution of Eminence.” The tag of IoE makes an institution eligible for a grant of Rs 1,000 crore from the Centre over five years. Apart from JU, the UGC had denied the status to Ashoka University in Sonepat, Azim Premji University and Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bengaluru, KREA University in Andhra Pradesh and the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar. Aligarh Muslim University and Tezpur University also did not make the cut. The state had written to UGC to reconsider its decision. State education department sources said JU’s name had been removed as the state had declined to share the burden of funding the IoE status. JU submitted a revised scheme of Rs 606 crore to UGC last year, of which it sought Rs 454 crore from the Centre and proposed to raise the remainder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-top-indian-univ-on-stanford-list/articleshow/87192621.cms||---

A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh stated that it was “rather curious” as to how a “revised estimate” of over Rs 79 crore was arrived at by the PWD officials and then forwarded to the finance department of Delhi government without the involvement of experts from the field of information technology.

---||Ghaziabad||How Meerut’s Deepak Tyagi became Yati Narsinghanand||GHAZIABAD: Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, a priest who has been openly communal in his public statements targeting Muslims, will now hold a prestigious position in the Juna akhara, which has inducted him as a ‘mahamandaleshwar’. The elevation comes barely a week after he likened a 10-year-old boy from the minority community who had wandered into the compound of the Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad to “a trained killer” and alleged he had been sent for “a recce” of the premises. Police had later clarified that the boy was headed for the adjoining health centre but had lost his way. Another boy from the minority community, who had entered the temple compound this March to drink water, was thrashed by an aide of Yati. The Dasna Devi temple, of which Yati is head priest, has a banner at the gate prohibiting entry of Muslims. The Meerut-born priest, now in his mid-50s, has been at the Dasna Devi temple since 2007. The 10 years preceding this were transformative, according to those who have known him a long time, drawing him to the views that he today espouses and vows to defend. Deepak Tyagi before he took ‘sanyas’, he renamed himself Deependra Narayan Singh during this period before settling on Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati. “In 1998, he met BJP’s BL Sharma. It changed him as a person,” said Anil Yadav, a friend of Yati. Yati, who studied at Chaudhary Tara Chand inter college in Hapur, claims to have left India in 1989 to pursue a chemical technology course in Moscow. He says he graduated in 1994 and worked as an engineer before returning to India in 1997 when his mother fell ill. Yati says his younger brother is still in Moscow. “When my mother's health was failing, both of us wanted to return to India. But later, we decided that I will come back and take care of our parents and my younger brother will stay there and take care of the family financially,” Yati told TOI on Thursday. His father, he says, worked in the central government and his grandfather was associated with Congress. After his return to India, he was briefly associated with the Samajwadi Party, according to his friend Yadav. “For some time, Yati taught maths to students of class 10 & 12. But later, he developed interest in politics and joined Samajwadi party,” said Yadav. During those years, he worked out of an ‘office’ near Shambu Dayal PG College in Ghaziabad. Local Samajwadi functionaries said they did not know if Yati had been a member. During his Moscow days, circle appears to have been more inclusive. Arun Tyagi, who said he was with him in hostel while they studied in the Russian capital, said there were people from different countries and communities there, including from Pakistan and Bangladesh and all of them mingled as friends. “Yati was a good cook used to make delicious vegetarian food that wasn’t otherwise easily available in Moscow,” said Tyagi, who works with GIC and is based in Hapur. “If anyone at the hostel wanted Indian food, Yati would cook,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/how-meeruts-deepak-tyagi-became-yati-narsinghanand/articleshow/87193642.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Amaravati||Allocations made by Krishna water tribunal final: Andhra Pradesh||AMARAVATI: The AP government has urged the Centre not to entertain any request by Telangana for reallocation of the Krishna river water. The state said the allocations made by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-I) were final and there was no provision to refer these allocations either to the KWDT-II or a new tribunal. AP claimed that the Telangana government withdrew the writ in the Supreme Court as it was well aware of the fact that the petition was not maintainable. Telangana government has been demanding reallocation of water in the Krishna river in the 50:50 ratio, instead of the present 66: 34 (AP:TS). AP water resources department secretary J Syamala Rao has sought an appointment with the secretary of Union jal shakti ministry. In a letter to the Union secretary, Rao said that as per the section 4(1) of ISRWD (amended in 2002), the gazette decision of KWDT-I is final and can’t be reopened. “It is an undisputed fact that KWDT-I has allocated 811 tmc ft of water from the Krishna to AP and allowed it to utilise over and above the total available water of 2,130 tmc ft by the AP in 1976 itself. It attained the force of the decree of Supreme Court and can’t be reopened,” said Syamala Rao. He said even KWDT-II which reviewed the entire issue decided not to disturb the allocations made by the KWDT-I. The KWDT-II had only made fresh allocations to new projects based on 65 per cent dependability instead of 75 per cent dependability criteria adopted by KWDT-I. He said KWDT-II made allocations over and above 2,130 tmc ft. Syamala Rao added there was a status quo order by Supreme Court with regard to the allocations made by KWDT-II. “Since Telangana was part of undivided AP, it was represented by then AP government before the tribunals and protected the rightful share of the projects located in Telangana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-krishna-water-allocations-final-no-need-for-new-tribunal/articleshow/87195035.cms||Samdani MN
---||Salem||Salem farmlands submerge after incessant rain||SALEM: Farmlands in Kannankurichi town panchayat have been submerged in rainwater following the continuous downpour in the district for the past couple of days. Farmers said the standing crops have started damaging, as the water was stagnating on agriculture lands. Karpagam village, where flowers such as jasmine, marigold, chrysanthemum, cockscomb, crape jasmine, crossandra, ghanera, oleander and winter jasmine were cultivated on 300 acres, was the most affected by the recent showers. S Gubendiran, a farmer from the village, said it was that time of the year when the demand for flowers would usually go up. “It’s the season for weddings and festivals like Diwali, when people will buy flowers in large quantities. We had planted flowering plants expecting a bumper harvest. The continuous rain has shattered all our dreams.” The farmers have requested the district administration to assess the damage to their crops through the horticulture department and compensate them for their losses. “We could at least repay our loans if we get some compensation from the government,” they said. A meteorological department official, meanwhile, said the district had received more rainfall this month compared to the same period in previous years. He said the district had received 305.4mm rain on October 20, 84.8mm on October 19, 288.8mm on October 17 and 103.8mm on October 16. “The district will receive more rain in the coming days after the onset of northeast monsoon,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/farmlands-submerge-in-salem/articleshow/87192589.cms||---

However, over the past few days, Covid vaccination has slowed down due to the festive and crop-cutting season. The health department is now taking measures to scale up the vaccination drive. Out of the total 6.11 crore doses administered, 3.16 crore were administered to men and 2.95 crore doses were given to women. The beneficiaries who received Covishield are 5.39 crore, while 71.5 lakh doses of Covaxin have been administered in the state. Rest of the doses received were of Sputnik vaccine. Over the past few days, Covid vaccination drive in the state has slowed down. The state government is, however, taking measures to scale up the vaccination drive now. Taking up the issue, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, recently, through video conferencing, directed the medical department officers to speed up the drive. On the issue, health minister Raghu Sharma said that the vaccination drive will be given further pace for cent-percent inoculation of the targeted group. Sharma said that Rajasthan is among the leading states in Covid vaccination and corona management. “Our efforts will be in the direction of achieving vaccination targets in a time-bound manner and at a fast pace so that we can easily cover the targeted group,” he added. On an average, daily vaccination is being done at over 4,500 vaccination centres, covering rural and urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/out-of-billion-vax-doses-states-contribution-was-6-crore-shots/articleshow/87194571.cms||---

Hearing a batch of petitions challenging certain sections of APSDC Act and pledging future revenues and properties of the government to avail of loans, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice C Praveen Kumar asked the state government how the tax revenues are being credited to APSDC account instead of the consolidated fund. Advocate-general S Sriram refuted the allegations by the petitioners as far from the truth and all the revenues are being credited to the consolidated fund only. He said the petition was politically motivated to trouble the government. Arguing on behalf of one of the petitioners, advocate Y Balaji said that the state government named governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan as guarantor for the loans that the state government availed of by pledging properties like parks, tahsildar offices, staff quarters and many others. He said the state government violated the Constitution by making the governor as guarantor for the loans it has availed of from the financial institutions. The high court also sought clarification from the state government on how the governor’s name was included as guarantor to the loans. The bench observed that if the tax revenues are being credited directly to the APSDC account, that cannot be allowed as the revenues should come to the consolidated fund and sought records for the same. The advocate-general assured the bench that he will place entire records before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-how-governors-name-was-included-as-guarantor-for-loans/articleshow/87192628.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The toll rose to five on Thursday from the four it had held steady for the last couple of days. Maharashtra has been recording below 2,000 cases for the last one week. It reported 39 deaths on Thursday, a day after listing 21 deaths, the lowest in 8 months. With this, the total caseload of the state rose to 65.98 lakh and deaths stood at 1,39,925. Despite the slight rise in cases, BMC officials said the “Covid curve” in Mumbai is almost static and there appears to be no “cluster of cases” in any of the 24 wards. Only five wards have a weekly infection rate that is higher than the city’s average of 0.05%. At KEM Hospital, Parel, 16 severe patients are admitted at the moment, said dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh. The BKC jumbo centre that can accommodate over a thousand patients had only 38 on Thursday, said dean Dr Rajesh Dere. According to BMC data released on Thursday, 11 contacts per Covid-positive patient are being tested in October as against 12 and 14 in September and August, respectively. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the second wave is coming to an end in the state and they are expecting a spike in cases after Diwali. “To reduce the spike and it’s severity, we are pushing for vaccination,” said Tope. But vaccine nubers are not encouraging too. “We are trying to reach out to communities that are hesitant to get vaccinated,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-toll-rises-cases-in-city-make-up-27-of-maha-tally/articleshow/87193641.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Azharuddin-led HCA affairs require CBI inquiry, says SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said the affairs of the faction-ridden Hyderabad Cricket Association, led by former India captain Mohd Azharuddin, require a CBI inquiry but observed that it would appoint a retired SC judge as administrator to conduct a thorough inquiry into its “sorry state of affairs”. The controversy arose over alleged unilateral appointment of former SC judge Deepak Verma, who had created quite a stir while being the ombudsman of the Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA), as the ombudsman of HCA in 2019 by president Azharuddin apparently without consulting the Association’s nine-member apex council, the final decision-making authority. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli that immediately after Azharuddin appointed Verma as ombudsman of HCA, eight apex council members said no such appointment was made as the council has taken no such decision. Verma, however, took over as ombudsman. This factional fight led to litigation and the matter reached the Telangana High Court which upheld the appointment. Verma allegedly lost no time in issuing showcause notice to the apex council members who had opposed his appointment. They were later suspended. The CJI-led bench said, “It is a very serious case. It actually requires a CBI probe. We will banish both factions from the management of the HCA and appoint a retired judge as administrator who can conduct an impartial inquiry into the alleged irregularities. We are very serious about it. Let both sides go out.” Kumar said, “We know how the ombudsman (Verma) worked.” For the other side, senior advocate Rakesh Khanna told the court that the retired SC judge to be appointed as administrator should look into the issues flagged by the ombudsman. The CJI said, “Both sides are responsible for the sorry state of affairs of the Hyderabad Cricket Association. We will find out who can conduct the inquiry.” It told the HCA to ask the ombudsman not to pass any orders on the matter till the SC found a retired judge to conduct an inquiry. When both sides tried to heap blame at the other’s door, the bench said, “We are not that blind. We are aware of the affairs of HCA. We are thinking of a long-term solution.” The SC posted the matter for passing orders on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/azharuddin-led-hca-affairs-require-cbi-inquiry-says-sc/articleshow/87195042.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

BMC officials, though, said there is no cause for worry; the overall case fatality rate (the proportion of individuals diagnosed with a disease who die from that disease) in October is down to 0.78—the lowest in five months. “The case fatality rate (CFR) throughout the second wave was low in Mumbai as compared to the first wave in 2020,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who is a member of the state government’s task force on mortality. During the first wave which peaked in September 2020, the CFR rose from 13.27 in March 2020 to 4.78 in July 2020. The CFR in February, which was when the second wave began, was 0.70 and kept rising to 2.5 in May, which saw the maximum number of deaths in the second wave (1,701). According to the data released by the BMC on Thursday, CFR has been steadily dropping since then to 1.15 in September. “We could keep the CFR low because of the unity among various stakeholders in the city,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “Individual doctors, NGOs, private sector hospitals and others followed the guidelines issued by the BMC. There was similar and uniform care available throughout the city, leading to lower deaths.” said Kakani. As cases decline, the main target is to achieve zero deaths. “With the availability of newer medicines such as monoclonal antibodies, the probability of death has significantly reduced, if a patient reaches hospital in time,” said a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-case-fatality-at-5-mth-low-decreasing-since-may/articleshow/87193645.cms||---

After a gap of 10 days for Durga Puja, all the 25 traffic guards across the city and divisional police forces resumed night nakas from Thursday following orders from the state administration. “We have requested the owners of restaurants and other shops to comply with the night restriction. We will take a stern action against those who don’t do so,” said an officer of Lalbazar. According to the police, the special focus of the nakas will be on drink driving. In the past two weeks, around 60 people have been arrested for drink driving. With Diwali round the corner, the nakas will also help cops keep tabs on the entry of the banned crackers in the city. The officers posted at the nakas have been asked to nab anyone trying to smuggle the illegal firecrackers into the city. “Based on our experience in the past five months, we have planned some measures at specific points in the coming days to combat the violations of night restrictions and traffic rules, including overspeeding and drink driving,” said an assistant commissioner of police. Cops said that the areas reporting the highest number of violations post midnight were different from those reporting violations post 11pm. Between 11pm and midnight, the maximum violations were seen in the areas like Park Street, Park Circus, Ballygunge and Gariahat. Post midnight the violations shifted to Ultadanga and Tiljala. “We need better coordination with Bidhannangar, Barrackpore and Baruipur police to keep tabs on drink driving at night. To implement the night restrictions, we need to step up checking at the city’s entry points,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/night-nakas-back-cops-ask-restos-bars-to-shut-by-10-30pm/articleshow/87192636.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

If the tribal hamlet of Lammasingi in Chintapalle mandal in Vizag Agency is popular for its cool and foggy weather during winter, Vanajangi Hills is drawing visitors for its sunrise view amid dense clouds. The hill range is located 3,400 ft above mean sea level and named after Vanajangi village, a small hamlet. “We used to visit Lammasingi once a month. Now, we visit Vanajangi. The best time to reach the hills and to capture the beauty of the sunrise is 5 am,” said L Ravi Teja, a software professional from Vizag city. The hills shot to fame after groups of nature lovers and trekkers launched an online campaign highlighting the beauty of the spot. It takes about 3-4 hour drive from Vizag city to reach the vantage point as it is around 100 km from the city and 6 km from Paderu.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Trolled for Lakshmi puja pictures, Ali Akbar’s grandson hits back||KOLKATA: Sarod player Shiraz Ali Khan, who is the grandson of legendary musician Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, shut up trolls who took a dig at him for posting photos of Lakshmi Puja celebrations at his residence. Shiraz had married Atrayee Sengupta in January 2020. This is the first year that Atrayee celebrated Lakshmi Puja at their Ranikuthi residence. Atrayee told TOI that she had grown up watching her mother offer prayers to goddess Lakshmi. “I am so happy that Shiraz supported me when I expressed a desire to do this puja. We want our child to grow up in an environment where he respects all religions,” she said. The Lakshmi Puja at the residence of sarod player Shiraz Ali KhanThough many appreciated the puja photo Shiraz clicked and shared as his Facebook story, trolls jumped into the fray. “I was very upset and disappointed to find a family friend from Bangladesh laughing at my gesture. I do not support such behavior and that’s why I wrote a post stating that anyone, who believes that it is important to react similarly to stand by a community, should unfriend me and never try to connect with me or my family in future,” Shiraz told TOI. Condemning the incidents of violence in Bangladesh, the great grandson of Baba Allauddin Khan pointed out that it is “significant” that this Lakshmi Puja was held just days after that incident. The young sarod player specially mentions the influence of his grandmother — Zubeida Khan — who taught him to respect all religions. “She was the first lady to introduce me to the worship of Hindu god and goddesses, including Maa Saraswati and Maa Kali. Though my great grandfather was a practicing Muslim who would offer namaz five times a day, he also worshipped Maa Sarada in Maihar. I was brought up by my grandmother who was inspired by this thought. Thereafter, my aunt Ameena Perera, my uncle Ustad Aashish Khan, my elder sister Sahana Gupta and my mother Ayesha Khan made me realise the importance of all religions. My schooling at Patha Bhavan also played an important role in inculcating this thought,” Shiraz said. Appreciating Shiraz’s post, Ustad Aashish Khan said the family believes in the philosophy of Baba Allauddin Khan for whom every religion was equal. “Our only religion is music and we worship every god and goddess,” the senior sarod maestro wrote on Facebook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sarod-player-hits-back-after-being-trolled-for-posting-lakshmi-puja-pics/articleshow/87192647.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt plans special vax drive for college students from October 25||MUMBAI: The state government has announced a special-focus immunisation drive for eligible students across college campuses. The drive, Mission Yuva Swasth Abhiyaan, jointly organised by the health department and the higher and technical education department, will be conducted between October 25 and November 2, just before Diwali sets in. On Thursday, health minister Rajesh Tope said there are roughly 5,000 colleges under the department which include polytechnics, ITIs, professional colleges and other affiliated institutions and cover nearly 40 lakh students who are over 18 years old.  “We have asked all principals for a list of students who are yet to be vaccinated. The health department in turn will make doses available for the drive,” said Tope. This is the second such special drive organised by the state; earlier, the state had organised Mission Kavach Kundal to vaccinate 15 lakh people every day before Dussehra, but achieved only 50% of its target. The students’ drive is also open for dropouts who can go to a nearby college. “I will request the chief minister to allow students to take the trains, but he will take the final decision,” Tope told TOI. “No student will be allowed to come to college if they are not fully vaccinated,” reiterated Uday Samant, minister of higher and technical education, at the conference. Tope said they will provide colleges with medical equipment, ambulance, medical staff and vaccines. “After the drive is over, we will falicitate three colleges that perform the best,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-plans-spl-vax-drive-for-college-students-from-oct-25/articleshow/87193656.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Garbage gone, welcome to Bopal eco park!||AHMEDABAD: There is a new ecological park in Bopal! An illegal landfill site that was once a nauseating heap of garbage on GEB road has today transformed into a place of solitude and calm. There was a time when one saw stray dogs, cattle and even rats munch at the refuse that was discarded by residents. There was almost 3 lakh tonnes of legacy waste lying at the dumpsite. Back in 2016, the Bopal Nagarpalika had assured that it will make provisions to take the waste to Pirana and clear off the garbage heap, but not much was accomplished. But in early 2020, a project was floated to convert this 22,000 sq metre of space into an ecological park soon after the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation took over the Bopal-Ghuma nagarpalika. This Rs 3.5 crore project involved laying of a new top layer of soil to hold moisture and bind the roots of plants. “A black soil layer was added to make it more fertile. The process costed the AMC about Rs 75 lakh. Lighting and plantation will cost another Rs 1 crore. The park also has a small pond to attract migratory birds,” says a senior AMC official. The AMC had installed a bio-mining machine which could process 1,000 tonnes of garbage in an eight-hour shift at the site. The officials claimed that works such as the construction of a compound wall and laying of drainage and storm water lines took the maximum time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/garbage-gone-welcome-to-bopal-eco-park/articleshow/87192666.cms||---

Additional Sessions Judge Vrinda Kumari noted that the involvement of others, including the roles of the bank officials, in the case cannot be ruled out. “The police file shows that five accounts were opened in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank and Central Bank. This aspect is still under investigation. The allegation of cheating innocent citizens of their hard-earned money through the said call centre in a systematic way is too grave to be ignored. As per the IO, the custodial interrogation of the applicant-accused is required,” the court said in the order. The accused’s counsel had contended that he was merely running a security agency from the premises and was falsely implicated in the matter. The court said, “The presence of twelve women employees and one male employee along with thirteen active mobile phones and five non-functional mobile phones do not support the contention that the applicant/accused was merely running a security agency from the premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-man-who-duped-many-via-fake-call-centres/articleshow/87193664.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||About 3,300 square yard of Osmania University land sold by society: Telangana govt to HC||HYDERABAD: About 3,300 square yards of prime land of Osmania University (OU) has been allegedly sold as plots by a co-operative housing society and the fraud was now being probed by cops, the state government told the Telangana High Court on Wednesday. The state’s response came after hearing resumed in a PIL based on a letter written by OU research scholar Poladi Ramana Rao in May 2020 seeking to know the status of the land from the state. According to advocate general BS Prasad, Tulasi Cooperative Housing Society had in 1976 bought 4,800 square yards (adjacent to the 3,300 square yards in dispute now). After a prolonged legal battle with OU, the society won the title over 4,800 square yards based on a surveyor’s report. The society divided it into 14 plots of equal size, sold 13 and marked one for park, he said. “But subsequently the society grabbed 3,300 square yards adjacent land and sold it to nine persons. This land is not part of the 4,800 square yards of society land. This is over and above that land and it has no right over it. The society is using the surveyor’s report to claim this additional land,” the AG said. The society has been showing the same decreed land and documents to sell away the plots on extra 3,300 square yards now, the AG said. Pointing out that the society never informed either the civil court or HC about selling the 4,800 square yards it won after court battle, the petitioner said: “The society has to answer one question. Whose 3,300 square yards did it sell later?” He also brought to the notice of the court the complaint filed by OU chief security officer with the DGP and Hyderabad police commissioner against the encroachment while describing the society as a bogus entity. But the advocates appearing for those who bought the plots on 3,300 square yards said they were genuine buyers and accused the OU of running a proxy war through a research scholar. This was refuted by the advocate general. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy gave six weeks to the state to file its counter and adjourned the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3300-sq-yd-of-ou-land-sold-by-society-t-to-hc/articleshow/87195060.cms||M Sagar Kumar

On the very first day, the civic body received Rs14 lakh revenue through sale of tickets, as 96,171 passengers commuted in 349 Aapli buses operated on 50 different routes. Four Aapli Buses could not run due to shortage of drivers and conductors. Sources said that on October 13, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B gave the permission to operate 100% Aapli Bus fleet. Subsequently, transport manager and deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Bhelave issued a circular on October 18, permitting 100% Aapli Buses on city roads and mofussil areas. Sources pointed out that the three red bus operators and two ticketing agencies had faced hardships and financial losses to retain the Aapli Bus crew, like drivers and conductors. Of the 750-odd Aapli Bus crew, most of them had opted for different works after NMC kept Aapli Bus operation shut from March 24, 2020 to October 2020. Later, the civic body partially resumed the city bus operation, but it never plied the full fleet of Aapli Bus up till now. Against its initial planning to operate 390 buses, NMC was able to operate 350 buses on 58 routes. These buses are supposed to complete 4,547 trips, covering 67,143 km on these routes. However, NMC could operate only 350 buses, which made 4,481 trips and covered almost 64,192 km. As per details obtained from the department, the civic body earned over Rs13.89 lakh from the sale of tickets, which is the highest post Covid lockdown, confirmed a senior official from the department. To a query, the official said that with the opening of educational institutions, especially colleges, footfall of passengers will increase. NMC’s revenue from the sale of tickets will reach the Rs20 lakh mark in the coming days, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/21-months-on-all-349-aapli-buses-back-on-city-roads/articleshow/87192691.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Later, he threw her body in a well.” The body was found in the well on October 1, following which a case of accidental death was registered with MIDC Waluj police station. Inspector Sandeep Gurme said, “The body had completely decomposed making the case difficult.” Gurme said the victim’s children were aware of her relationship with Kharat, and hence, his activities were under the scanner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-held-for-lovers-murder/articleshow/87193710.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Track the pollution level in your cityThis gradual reduction, Sumaira Abdul Ali, convenor of Awaaz Foundation said, is a welcome change as in 2019 three crackers defied the limits. In 2020, because of Covid-19 restrictions, the noise test was not conducted. However, seven of the crackers tested on Thursday did not have the chemical composition or content printed on them which experts say does matter in measuring the amount of air pollution. Like in the case of noise, an expertise is yet to be developed to scientifically measure emissions, such as of barium nitrate, from each cracker. Sources, said efforts are on to do so and similar tests may be started from next year to check the air emissions too. In 2018, the Supreme Court had allowed the sale and use of only ‘green’ crackers which have less noise and air pollution levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-diwali-likely-to-be-less-noisy-shows-test-on-crackers/articleshow/87194627.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

On October 15, the four-year-old girl was playing near her residence when her neighbour called her to his house and allegedly violated her, Rajendranagar police said. The accused, 23, was known to the girl, who occasionally visits his house. “The offence took place at the residence of the accused. When the girl raised an alarm, the accused let go the girl. After the offence, the girl’s family went to their native place and there they came to know about the incident. On Thursday after returning to the city, they lodged a complainant,” assistant commissioner of police (Rajendranagar division) B Gangadhar said. According to police, after the issue was brought to their notice, a case was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Section 376 (rape) of IPC. The girl was sent for a medical examination. It is learnt that the accused, a motor mechanic and a bachelor, was taken into custody. He is being questioned. In the second case, a teenager was allegedly raped by her boyfriend some days ago after promising to marry her . Though a complaint was lodged at the Banjara Hills police station on Tuesday, it came to light on Thursday. The accused befriended the victim and have been friends for the past one year.

---||Delhi||'Denied chicken', protester beats up man at Singhu border||NEW DELHI: A labourer was allegedly thrashed by a protester at Singhu border for refusing to give him chicken. The accused, who claims to be a Nihang Sikh, has been arrested. Two videos of the purported incident went viral on social media. The alleged victim, Manoj Paswan, was seen narrating his ordeal to people. The victim claimed he had taken chicken from a farm on his cart to deliver them someplace across the protest site when a “Sardarji” demanded the birds from him. “I took out a slip to show him that the number of chicken I was carrying was mentioned in it, so I couldn’t fulfil his demand,” said Paswan. The protester got infuriated and started thrashing him. Paswan claimed he was also beaten up with a stick carried by the man. “When he hit me, I took out a slip and told him that the chickens were counted and I could lose the job if I gave one to him,” he added. The people who shot the video claimed that one of his legs was fractured. Another person who tried to save him was also thrashed. Later, another video surfaced in which other alleged Nihangs beat up one of their men and then took him somewhere. A senior officer in Sonipat police said they had arrested the accused, identified as Naveen from Karnal in Haryana. “A few months ago, he came to the protest site and became a Nihang. He was living with a group of Nihang Sikhs,” he added. Another officer said, “I saw him yesterday. He was there at the border in a Nihang’s dress carrying a weapon. He told us that he was a Jat.” Earlier, a 35-year-old man was beaten up by a mob, allegedly led by Nihangs, at a protest site in Kundli. The victim’s left hand was chopped off and both his legs were fractured with a blunt object last Friday. Four Nihangs were arrested in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/labourer-beaten-up-at-singhu-border-by-protester-claiming-to-be-a-nihang/articleshow/87193702.cms||---
---||World||Queen Elizabeth II spent night in hospital for tests: Palace||LONDON: Queen Elizabeth II spent a night in hospital for tests after being forced to cancel a visit to Northern Ireland this week, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday. "Following medical advice to rest for a few days, The Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, returning to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today (Thursday), and remains in good spirits," a statement said. Britain's domestic Press Association news agency said the trip to hospital had been kept under wraps because it was expected to be a short stay, and also to protect the 95-year-old monarch's privacy. The overnight stay was for "practical reasons", it added. The palace made the announcement after The Sun newspaper broke the news. The tabloid said it was decided she should stay at the private King Edward VII's Hospital in central London because it was too late to make the 26-mile (42-kilometre) trip back to Windsor. She has previously been treated at the exclusive clinic, which is known for treating the royal family, including in 2013 for gastroenteritis, when she also stayed for one night. In 2003, surgeons at the hospital removed minor non-cancerous growths from her face and operated on her knee, while in 1982 had a wisdom tooth extracted. The Queen's late husband, Prince Philip, spent four weeks from February this year for treatment for a pre-existing heart condition. He died in April, just a few weeks before his 100th birthday. The head of state, who has been on the throne since 1952 and is Britain's longest-serving monarch, was said to be back at her desk on Thursday afternoon, undertaking light duties. She had been due to attend an ecumenical service in the border town of Armagh on Thursday to mark the 100th centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland. But the palace said on Wednesday morning she had "reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days". The decision was not related to the coronavirus and she was said to have been resting at Windsor. The Queen, who still rides and drives on her private estates, has had a busy schedule since returning from her remote Balmoral estate in northeast Scotland at the start of October. But news that she had an overnight stay in hospital will inevitably raise fears for her health, given her advanced age, and questions about whether she should slow down further. Next year she is due to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. Last week, she delivered a speech at the opening of the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, and at the weekend spent a day at Ascot racecourse. On Monday, she held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand, and on Tuesday received two ambassadors, also by videolink. On Tuesday evening, she hosted a reception at Windsor for international business leaders attending a government investment summit, including the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, and senior British ministers. At that reception, the Queen appeared cheerful as she, her eldest son and heir Prince Charles, 72, and grandson Prince William, 39, mingled with guests, none of whom were wearing facemasks. Coronavirus restrictions were lifted in Britain in July but an increase in cases has prompted calls for measures to be reimposed to prevent further close-contact transmission. Daily virus cases crossed the 50,000 mark on Thursday, according to the latest government figures -- the highest since July 17. The Queen and Prince Philip moved to Windsor in March last year as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. The decision was made to self-isolate because of the increased risk of infection due to their age, although she has since been vaccinated. The Queen is still expected to join other senior royals for a series of events linked to the upcoming UN climate summit in Glasgow next month. Last week, she was seen for the time at a major public event using a walking stick, but royal officials said it was not linked to any specific health condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/queen-elizabeth-ii-spent-night-in-hospital-for-tests-palace/articleshow/87195769.cms||---

Yadav had also tweeted about his visit. The SKM in its meeting on Thursday took serious note of the development and suspended Yadav for a month. शहीद किसान श्रद्धांजलि सभा से वापिसी में बीजेपी कार्यकर्ता शुभम मिश्रा के घर गए। परिवार ने हम पर गुस्सा नही किया। ब… https://t.co/EFvThoTpOP— Yogendra Yadav (@_YogendraYadav) 1634053172000Yadav is member of 9 members committee of SKM which normally take the highest decisions. “The leaders of Punjab’ farm organisations wanted to permanently expel Yogendra Yadav from SKM but as he apologised and assured to apologise in the social media about his act, he was only suspended”, senior SKM leader and farm outfit BKU Ekta Dakaunda president Buta Singh Burjgill told TOI. Earlier, farm leader Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala had told TOI that the farm outfits are angry over whatever Yogendra Yadav is doing and we will put an agenda in the SKM meeting to expel him from SKM. Even the BJP leaders had been demanding his expulsion from SKM, asking what is a politician doing in a farmer protest. The BJP had ben accusing Yadav of misleading the farmers and asking them to take political decisions. Sources said Yogendra Yadav was not being liked by farm groups from Punjab and had been feeling suffocated in his leadership but as he (Yadav) had some admirers in the SKM, they were saving him from action. Farm leader from Haryana, Gurnam Singh Charuni, too had been speaking against Yogendra Yadav, who too belongs to Haryana. It has to be mentioned that Yogendra Yadav had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/yogendra-yadav-suspended-from-skm-for-visiting-home-of-slain-bjp-activist/articleshow/87193708.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Woman denied bail for killing newborn||AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Thursday denied bail to the 23-year-old woman arrested for killing her newborn baby and dumping the body in a garbage van. The accused in this case, Shivani Srivastava, claimed innocence and requested for bail saying that she has been lodged in jail for three months. However, additional sessions judge V A Rana said that the woman’s involvement in the murder, secretly disposing the body of the child and destruction of evidence appears prima facie believable looking at the chargesheet papers. The incident had taken place in February when the body of a newborn was found wrapped in a plastic bag inside a garbage van. The van driver alerted the police and a probe was launched into the case of murder following this. The woman was arrested four months later and during interrogation, she revealed that the child was born to her extramarital relationship and she feared that the child would not be accepted by her family. She did not want her husband to find out about her affair and pregnancy, the police claimed. The woman allegedly gagged the child by placing the socks of her 1.5 year-old boy into the newborn’s mouth. After the child died, she packed the body in a plastic bag and threw the bag in the garbage collection van the next morning. She was booked under Sections 302, 318 and 201 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-denied-bail-for-killing-newborn/articleshow/87192730.cms||---

The auctions for 300 firecrackers stalls in 23 locations across six divisions were held in the six divisional office buildings. These were held after the general body (GB) on Wednesday turned down NMC’s proposal to ban firecrackers in the city. NMC officials said they will allow the remaining 189 firecracker stalls on first-cum-first service basis. This year too, NMC has levied a clean environment tax of Rs 3,000 for each stall as per the directive of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to help the civic body collect and treat firecracker waste in the interest of public health. This year, NMC has introduced fire charges of Rs 500 for each stall per day. NMC has issued guidelines for the firecracker stall-holders in view of the Covid pandemic and as part of the safety measures to avoid any untoward fire incident. A three-metre distance is to be maintained between two firecracker stalls and more than 50 stalls will not be allowed at one location. No more than five people will be allowed at the time at the stalls. There has to be a distance of six feet between two people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/1st-day-nmc-earns-rs-32l-though-auctionof-firecracker-stalls/articleshow/87191579.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Delhi||Why argument that police are to blame for farmer blockade doesn’t hold water||NEW DELHI: The argument of farmers’ unions that roads are not blocked by protesters agitating against the three new agri-marketing laws does not hold ground at Delhi borders as their presence in huge numbers spills on both sides of the highways, mainly at their biggest protest site Singhu. The Singhu road has been completely narrowed for nearly five kilometres. The barricades, as flagged by the unions, have indeed been used by the police, blocking the main road, but they had come up like a fortress only after the Republic Day incident. The blocked area at Singhu is being used for deployment of additional security personnel. As a result, commuters now have to take a long detour through Singhu village creating chaos in residential areas. Once they enter the stretch on the highways at Singhu, they have to face congestion till Kundli as farmers’ tents and tractors/trolleys occupy the space along the roads. Similar scenes can be witnessed at two other protest sites, Ghazipur and Tikri Borders, with lesser congestion. All those who have been visiting the protest sites in the past over 10 months can notice the change post the Republic Day incident when thousands of farmers travelled to the Capital violating the approved routes with hundreds of them even entering the Red Fort. Though the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the joint platform of unions agitating for repeal of farm laws — as a group did not attend the proceedings of the Supreme Court on Thursday when a PIL on road blockade came up for hearing, few farmer organisations including Yogendra Yadav-led Jai Kisan Andolan, BKU (Rajewal) and others, who received notice from the apex court, were represented by their lawyers. As these organisations argued in the court that the roads were actually blocked by police, BKU (Tikait) leader Rakesh Tikait later told reporters at the Gazipur protest site that there was no need for them to leave the ‘morcha (protests)’ as they were not on roads obstructing any traffic. “We have not blocked the road. There were only curtains which were removed... You can see that the barricades were put out by police. They should remove those barricades. We are here and we will remain here,” said Tikait when asked about the SC observation. The SKM, meanwhile, in a fresh call for action, put out an all-India call for protest ‘dharnas’ across the country on October 26 to press for its demand of sacking and arrest of minister of state for home affairs Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, and to mark the completion of 11 months of farmers’ protests at Delhi Borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-argument-that-police-are-to-blame-for-farmer-blockade-doesnt-hold-water/articleshow/87193734.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Nashik||I-T searches on premises of seven onion traders in Nashik||NASHIK: The income tax (I-T) department on Thursday started searches on the premises of seven onion traders in Nashik district. The searches are being carried out at 20 locations in the district, including 13 locations in Pimpalgaon and seven other locations in rural parts of the district. Sources from I-T department said that the searches are being carried out to ascertain whether these traders have any unaccounted-for income and whether they are paying taxes on their total income. “We have just started the searches. It will take a day or two to complete the same. Our focus is on checking any unaccounted-for income and assets these traders may have, apart from probable black marketing and hoarding they may be involved in,” said sources from I-T. I-T sleuths have also seized some documents from the traders for further investigations. Twenty teams of over 100 officials from I-T departments in Nashik, Aurangabad and Pune are jointly conducting the searches at the residences and offices of these seven traders from 8.30 am on Thursday. When contacted, office-bearers of Nashik onion traders’ association confirmed searches by I-T sleuths, but they avoided commenting on the issue. In November last year (2020), the I-T sleuths had conducted searches on 11 onion traders in Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon, after the average wholesale onion prices had crossed Rs 5,000 per quintal mark. The I-T sleuths had conducted searches at residences, offices and godowns of the traders. Onion prices slideThe average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee (APMC), the country’s largest wholesale onion market, declined from Rs 2,700 per quintal on Wednesday to Rs 2,500 per quintal on Thursday. Earlier, the average wholesale onion price at the Lasalgaon APMC had increased up to Rs 3,700 per quintal, while the maximum wholesale onion price had gone up to Rs 4,121 per quintal due to drop in supply of onions. Heavy rainfall in September and October has affected the onion crop in Nashik district, a major onion cultivation area in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/i-t-searches-on-premises-of-7-onion-traders-in-nashik/articleshow/87191595.cms||Tushar Pawar

With 597 crop residue burning events on Thursday, the count reached 4,327, which is still less than the previous year when the crop residue burning cases were recorded at 9,444 on October 21. The firing events in the ongoing paddy harvesting season, however, have well surpassed those recorded in 2019 at 3,584 on October 21. The crop burning events on Thursday were recorded maximum in four bordering districts with Tarn Taran topping the chart at 162 cases, followed by Gurdaspur (53), Amritsar (52) and Ferozepur (50). Pathankot, which has track record of low stubble burning, has recorded no cases so far. Earlier, 788 burning events were recorded on October 20 and 496 on October 19. As against 597 burning cases recorded on Thursday, these were 825 in 2019 and 1,379 in 2020 on October 21. According to agriculture department sources, burning is expected to pick up further as farmers have again started paddy harvesting after facing inclement weather for few days. The bio decomposer trials have not started yet in Punjab despite state government claims that 3,000 trials will be made in the ongoing season to contain stubble burning. As of now, 8,500 nodal officers have been appointed in Punjab to look into burning cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stubble-burning-cases-close-to-500-daily-for-last-3-days/articleshow/87193727.cms||Neel Kamal

The man’s wife, Ayesha (32), and her mother, Suman (50), were declared dead in a hospital. Rajan (35), the friend of his brother-in-law Gagan, too succumbed to bullet injuries. Gagan (26) is battling for life. The murders took place in Gothda Mohbtabad village. The accused has been identified as Neeraj. Around 2.30am on Thursday, Neeraj and his friend Lekhraj — both wielding guns — knocked on the door of the house where his wife lived. It is believed that the couple’s 12-year-old son opened the door. Neeraj first used a knife to slit the throat of Ayesha and Suman and then went to the other room and fired at Gagan and Rajan. In 20 minutes, the duo had attacked all four adult members of the house and fled, leaving the 12-year-old boy crying, police said. Cops inspecting the house claimed at least four shots had been fired from a country-made pistol. By Sunday evening, the crime branch had arrested both Neeraj and Lekhraj. “We are questioning the two to understand what prompted them to commit the murders. An investigation is underway,” said Subhe Singh, a spokesperson for the police. The couple, sources said, had developed testy ties over a year ago. Since last year, Ayesha had been living separately from her husband. She moved into her mother’s house with her son apparently because Neeraj would often accuse her of being involved in an illicit relationship. Neeraj, who sells buttons for shirts, had tried to convince Ayesha to come back home several times, but to no avail. He also nursed a grudge against his mother-in-law, who, he thought, was not allowing Ayesha to return home in NIT 1. Lekhraj, who was with Neeraj during the murders, is a tailor and would buy buttons from him. Gagan has told the police that Neeraj had also been harassing him for a small loan he had taken. Gagan and Rajan were property dealers and had an office in Sector 56. After work on Thursday, Gagan had asked Rajan to come to his house in Gothda Mohbtabad and stay the night for some work. Both of them were hit in the chest. On Thursday morning, the police sealed the house, which originally belongs to a former sarpanch who had put it on rent. Neighbours said the family mostly stayed aloof. “Hardly anyone knew the family. They had shifted here a month ago. Everyone was worried seeing a police team in their house in the morning. Later, we learnt about the murders,” said Rajesh Kumar, a villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/man-slits-throat-of-wife-mother-in-law/articleshow/87196617.cms||Sagrika Kissu

The forest department is confident it will record a rise in the number of tigers in the reserves in the state and regain the Tiger State tag it lost to Madhya Pradesh in 2018 which recorded 526 big cats compared to 524 in Karnataka. Forest officials are ready for the fifth cycle of tiger count. All forest staff have been trained for the all-India exercise and are awaiting a directive from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a statutory body for tiger conservation in India, to start the process.It was announced that tiger monitoring would begin in October.Karnataka forest officials have shared the data of the annual tiger census done in June-July with NTCA. Officers say the authority may seek a clarification with regard to the annual count and if required another survey would be carried out. Camera trap or photo-capture method is used to record the number of tigers. At each location, two cameras are fitted to capture the movement of tigers and then match the data with records. Every tiger is identified by a number that has been given based on the stripes.Annual monitoring of tigers is done every year in all five tiger reserves – Bandipur, Nagarahole, Bhadra, Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple, and Kali—whereas the once in four-year tiger count, is done in 51 tiger reserves as well as in forested areas including wildlife sanctuaries.The exercise in Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary began a week ago and it is expected to be complete in two weeks’ time. The sanctuary has nearly two dozen tigers according to previous data. A survey will also be done in abutting Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. Sources claimed that due to the dearth of cameras in the department, the exercise will be staggered as cameras are being shared.The 2018 census pegged the tiger population in the state at 524, two less than Madhya Pradesh which recorded 526 tigers. Foresters claim there is an increase in the tiger count in the last four years in the state. As per the 2018 census report, India had 2,967 tigers.The first tiger count was done in 2006 during when the tiger number was just 1,411.MM Hills Wildlife Sanctuary DCF V Yedukondalu told TOI that about 250 staff have been roped in for the three-week-long monitoring work. The camera trap method is being used for the count and at 450 locations, a pair of camera each are fitted to monitor the movement of the big cat.BRT reserve deputy conservator of forests G Santhosh Kumar said his staff has been trained for the national-level exercise. The reserve has more than 52 tigers.Bandipur Tiger Reserve director SR Natesh said they are awaiting the directive for the count and are all set.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/tiger-census-begins-at-sanctuaries-in-ktaka/articleshow/87191592.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||One booked under OSA for recording court proceedings||Aurangabad: The Vedantnagar police have booked two persons, including a 21-year old student, on the charge of spying _ under Section 3 of The Official Secrets Act (OSA),1923 _ after they were caught using mobile phones to secretly film a criminal case proceeding before a sessions court here. The police also applied Section 120 of the Maharashtra Police Act, which deals with action for “without satisfactory excuse willfully enters or remains present in any building, monument or structure belonging to government or appropriated to public purposes”, against the two persons. However, legal experts were surprised by the application of the OSA in the case and described the same as “stretching things a bit too far” and as “bad in law”. A conviction under the OSA provision can attract imprisonment of three years and above. The Bombay high court’s guidelines relating to maintenance of decorum in court rooms prohibit use of mobile phones in a way that it creates a hindrance in court proceedings. Based on these guidelines, the principal district and sessions judges of the respective districts have passed orders restraining use of cell phones in courtrooms. Taking photos or video clips of court proceedings is strictly prohibited and any person caught violating this norm is to be proceeded against as per direction issued by the presiding officer of the court concerned. Depending upon the nature of act and assessment of the situation, the presiding officer can let off a violator after collecting a Rs500 fine or direct the court registrar to get the police to register an offence. “In my opinion, a Rs500 fine would have sufficed,” said senior lawyer Prashant Katneshwarkar. Lawyer Komal Kandharkar said, “If there are specific rules imposing restriction of mobile phones and fines defined under such rules, the same should have been used.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone-I) Ujwala Wankar, when asked about the justification behind applying the OSA in the instant case, told TOI, “The concerned court has taken a note of the incident and has directed the police to register an offence against the two persons. We will look into the issue of OSA application.” Kandharkar said, “Section 3 of the OSA defines penalties for spying. The basic question is whether these two people were actually spying on some state or national secret and were aiming to use the same against national interest.” According to Katneshwarkar, “Court proceedings are public hearings. There is nothing confidential or secret about them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/one-booked-under-osa-for-recording-court-proceedings/articleshow/87193735.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This new system is expected to be in place from December. At present, NMC employees go to the spot and take readings of water metres. Thereafter, they make entries in the system before getting printouts of the bills. This is a time-consuming process considering the inadequate workforce the civic body has. “Our plan is to send e-bills on the spot to the water taxpayers immediately after taking the reading. This will save time and people will also immediately get e-water bills either on email or on their phones,” said NMC officials. NMC sends quarterly bills to the water taxpayers in the city. But most of the taxpayers are yet to get water bills for the past one to two years due to a lack of workforce “We are confident that this new system will help us increase the revenue through water tax,” said the officials. “We have a total water tax dues of Rs 105 crore. NMC has also decided to snap the water connection of the water tax defaulters. But before it, the civic body wants to give an opportunity to the tax defaulters to pay their tax dues immediately,” added the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-send-e-water-bills-on-spot/articleshow/87191600.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||Govt signs MoU with tech firms for skill training||Panaji: To provide essential skills like computational thinking, coding and communication to children, the state government on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). In addition, a letter of intent was also signed with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), India and Google CS Education. Speaking at the function, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the initiative is a great opportunity for youth and students to bridge the skill gap with this training. “In the first phase, they will provide training required for employment,” he said, and urged students to participate and upgrade their skills. Providing skills to school and college students to empower and prepare them for the future is one of the recommendations of the new National Education Policy (NEP). Furthermore, employability skills are essential, especially given the technology-dependent workplaces. Through these collaborations, the directorate of higher education (DHE) is organising its first programme entitled Kaushalya Week, a skill development vacation camp for school children from November 8 to 13. These skills will be imparted to children aged 8-14 years at the camp that will be held at six centres across Goa. For successful implementation of this programme which will benefit about 1,100 students in the first phase, DHE has collaborated with TCS, ACM India and Google CS Education. The second programme that is planned from this academic year by DHE will further help college students to improve employability and communication skills under TCS’ Youth Employment Programme (YEP). This programme is designed to prepare youth, especially from the weaker sections of society, for employment by upgrading them with the required skill set. DHE, in an effort to achieve the goals laid out in NEP, intends to collaborate with various partners from academia and industry. One of the key objectives is to empower both the teachers and students to achieve academic excellence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-signs-mou-with-tech-firms-for-skill-training/articleshow/87193771.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body gets its revenue through collection from town planning department and property and water taxes. The NMC had expected to collect Rs 1,050 crore revenue during the first half of the current financial year, but could collect only Rs 750 crore — a deficit of Rs 300 crore. The Rs 750 crore revenue collection also includes Rs 550 crore GST grant from the state government, Rs 100 crore through various taxes of the town planning department, Rs 80 crore property tax and Rs 20 crore through water tax. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav directed all the department heads to carry out only necessary works that have budgetary provisions. The civic chief has also directed the town planning department to speed up the pending work. The NMC had projected a revenue collection of Rs 2,100 crore during the current financial year and is expecting a drop of Rs 350 crore in its revenue. “We are getting regular GST grants from the state government, but our revenue through various taxes from the town planning department have been badly affected,” an NMC official said. “We are expecting Rs 450 crore revenue through various taxes of the town planning department, but could collect only Rs 100 crore through various taxes of the town planning department during the April-September period. We have already started offline building plan submission and permission. Moreover, instructions have also been given to speed up the pending work of the town planning department to increase the revenue,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-records-28-drop-in-revenue-collection/articleshow/87191604.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Ranchi||13.2% out of 2.64 cr total beneficiaries fully vaccinated in J’khand||Ranchi: As the country celebrates the feat of administering of 100 crore vaccines, Jharkhand has been able to inoculate over 60% of its eligible beneficiaries by using over 1.9 crore doses. Out of a total 2.64 crore eligible beneficiaries, 13.2% have been completely inoculated while 60.75% have received their first dose. According to data available with state health department, a total of 34,32,000 beneficiaries which has a majority share of health care workers, frontline workers and elderly above 60 years of age have been completely inoculated while over 1.6 crore beneficiaries have received their first jab. Talking to TOI, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccine in state, Dr Rakesh Dayal, said, “The vaccination is going on at a steady pace in Jharkhand and we have come a long way from running less than 100 session sites to over 2,500 daily.” The vaccination drive in the state was launched on January 16 along with its national launch by the Union health ministry and the health department officials termed it a success in the state too which saw many challenges. “From fighting hesitancy to busting myths about the vaccine types, we have now inoculated around 1.92 crore beneficiaries constituting over 60% of total eligible persons and that isn’t an easy task. Not only hesitancy but the irregular supplies creating shortages, arranging for logistics to organise the session sites were the other challenges. However, we are in a comfortable position and I give all the credit to our healthcare workers for the same,” added Dayal. Asked what are the initiatives the state health department is taking to speed up the vaccination coverage, Dr Dayal said, “In order to increase our vaccination coverage, we have taken several initiatives like mobile vaccination vans across the state, organising special intensive drives for people living in rural areas and are issuing daily targets to each district and asking them to achieve it. Currently, we have set a target of 3 lakh doses per day and efforts are on to ensure that these are achieved.” According to state health department data, over 12 lakh beneficiaries are overdue on their second doses and in order to get them inoculated, the state health machinery has directed district officials to track these beneficiaries and get them to their nearest vaccine centre for the jabs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/13-2-out-of-2-64-cr-total-beneficiaries-fully-vaccinated-in-jkhand/articleshow/87192952.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Cabinet nod for new homes for 11 ministers in state capital||Ranchi: The 11 cabinet ministers of Jharkhand will soon have new homes for themselves. The state cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal of the state urban development department to build residences of 11 cabinet ministers of Jharkhand in Ranchi Smart City area in Dhurwa at a total of Rs 69.9 crore. Sources in the department said a detailed project report for the new construction is already being prepared. However, chief minister Hemant Soren will continue to live in his current government bungalow on Kanke Road. The BJP criticized the cabinet’s decision. “The Jharkhand government has been complaining that its revenues took a hit owing to the lockdown and outstanding dues (from the Centre). Under such circumstances, this money could have been used for improving infrastructure in the hospitals,” the party’s spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said. The state cabinet on Thursday reversed its decision and paved the way for auctioning of seven iron ore mines in West Singhbhum district for captive use. On August 18 last year, the cabinet had approved a proposal of the state mining department to reserve seven iron ore blocks for the Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation (JSMDC). The JSMDC was authorised to allocate these mines to the state government-owned enterprises. “The cabinet took its decision today based on the Union mines ministry’s suggestion that these blocks be put up for auction. The Centre suggested that these blocks may be reserved if the lessors fail to start production,” cabinet secretary Vandana Dadel said after the meeting. Before being reserved by the state, the lease to these iron ore blocks were held by M/S Rameshwar Jute Mills in Baraiburu (258 hectares), M/S Nirmal Kumar Pradip Kumar in Ghatkuri (149 hectares), Padam Kumar Jain in Thakurani (84 hectares), Mishri Lal Jain and Sons in Karampada (202 hectares), M/S Shah Brothers in Karampada (233 hectares), M/S Rungta and in Ghatkuri (138 hectares). Together, the blocks have iron ore reserves of 228.07 million tonnes and are spread over 1,178.59 hectares. In another decision, the cabinet capped the maximum quantity of paddy to be procured from one farmer at 200 quintals for the Kharif season this year. “The decision was taken to ensure that maximum farmers are covered under the paddy procurement scheme,” Dadel said. This year, the government aims to procure 8 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from the state’s farmers at Rs 2,050 per quintal. The cabinet also gave its nod to a proposal to set up CCTV cameras in 20 district courts across Jharkhand at a net expense of Rs 52 crore. CCTV cameras are currently installed in court complexes in Ranchi, Dhanbad, Chaibasa and Daltonganj. In yet another decision, the cabinet gave its nod to set up three halfway homes in Ranchi, Dhanbad and East Singhbhum districts to house specially-abled patients who have recovered from mental health problems. Each home can accomodate 30 people at once and will be built by the department of women and child welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cabinet-nod-for-new-homes-for-11-ministers-in-state-capital/articleshow/87193121.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Co-Win portal will be extended for all vaccine programmes in India: R S Sharma||On a day India crossed 100-crore vaccination mark, chairperson of the empowered committee for administration of Covid-19 vaccine in the country, R S Sharma, also the CEO of the National Health Authority (NHA) during his two-day visit to Jharkhand spoke to TOI’s Gaurav Pandey on Thursday on importance of Co-Win application, the challenges faced by them and the future usability of the platform. Excerpts: Q: We have crossed 100 crore jabs today. You were the man behind its technical arm (Co-Win). Who do you credit this success to? A: We wouldn’t have achieved this feat without the hard work of our healthcare workers, be it doctors, nurses, managers from national to panchayat levels. The feat is dedicated to them as they have toiled hard to vaccinate a billion people in last nine months. Q: How did the idea of Co-Win application take shape? A: India is a very large country with over a billion people and for vaccinating across demographics and keeping a track of each and every dose was next to impossible manually. So in order to ensure that each and every citizen could get jabbed, we came up with this platform. Q: What was the biggest challenge during the inception of portal and how much manpower and money was invested for creating it? A: The biggest challenge was the digital divide so we had to bring in a platform which would serve everyone from a person using I-phone to a basic feature phone. So, we decided that it has to be flexible and at the same time must have the necessary security for authentication. Coming to the investment part, it hasn’t cost fortunes and you wouldn’t believe if I say that a technical team five coders have worked on this along with a few other technical staff. The money which is going to be spent is on the data storage which is cloud based. Q: As you said that the portal hasn’t cost much on the exchequer but it seems countries globally are looking for the platform for their use. Will it be exported to them with a charge? A: After understanding the flexibility of Co-Win, a total of 147 countries participated in a training-cum-knowledge sharing programme which was organised and was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 5. We are already in process of training various countries expert on the platform and we might bring it as an open source in near future. Q: What will be the role of Co-Win after Covid-19 vaccination programme concludes? A: That is something which is very special as we will be using it for universal immunization programme for regular immunization with a little bit of modifications. Under this, we will be tweaking the software for accommodating the required data and it will help government keep a track of all the vaccination programs as well as its beneficiaries. It will also be helping the healthcare workers and beneficiaries to remind them of their doses and will be a game changer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/co-win-portal-will-be-extended-for-all-vaccine-programmes-in-india-r-s-sharma/articleshow/87193023.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Agitators scuffled with the security guards of BSL when they tried to stop them at SAIL Refractories Unit headquarters, where the interview was supposed to be held. Agitators under the banner of the Displaced Apprentices Association (VAS) staged demonstrations against BSL management demanding jobs and compensation against the land given to the company by their ancestors. Chief of communications, BSL, Manikant Dhan said, “Seeing the agitation of the displaced people, the interview was later cancelled by the management.” Most of the candidates had come from Rajasthan and other states after they got selected in written examination. Till the time of writing the report, hundreds of displaced people sat at the main gate of SRU as well as in front of BSL’s Ispat Bhawan and HRD Center. BSL management has sought the help of the district administration to normalise the situation. Amjad Hussain of VAS said, “We have completed plant training (apprentice). For the last few years, we are demanding jobs from BSL management who had given us training after assuring us jobs. But despite repeated requests, we are not being provided jobs. This forced us to stage demonstration. BSL management should provide jobs first to displaced as we have given everything for establishment of the steel plant.” DSP City Kuldeep Kumar tried to pacify the agitators, but it did not work. The displaced stated that their agitation would continue till the BSL management gave them written assurances regarding the employment. Anticipating protest, BSL management had shifted the examination centre overnight to SRU situated about 3 km away from HRD centre. But the displaced reached SRU in the morning. More than 100 people were selected in the written examination and were called for interview from October 21 to 23 for 49 vacancies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsl-cancels-interview-after-protests-by-displaced-youths/articleshow/87192877.cms||Divy Khare

To see that the officials entrusted with the responsibility are doing their jobs sincerely, ADM (Law and Order), Nand Kishore Lal, is making random visits to the 14 check points either at the Odisha and Bengal state borders or anchored to Seraikela-Kharsawan and West Singhbhum districts. "Along with the inter-state and inter-district check points, railway station and long distance bus terminus are two other places where Covid-19 testing of the outsiders coming to the district are being done," Lal said. Between July 1 and October 20, a total of 1,45,629 people have arrived in the district by train, of which 13 are Covid-19 positive while samples of 186 are pending for examination. Likewise, 37,915 people have come to the district by road during the same period, of which 11 tested positive. Between October 10 and 20, a total of 14 positive cases were detected and 31 infected recovered, suggesting recovery rate higher than infection rate. "Covid test of the samples collected during the Durga puja, Diwali and Chhath would determine how safe we are from the coronavirus hence the thrust is on precautionary steps," said Additional Chief Medical Officer, (ACMO), Sahir Pall. The district has reported 51,952 positive cases, of which 50,875 have recovered, 1,058 succumbed to the disease and 19 active cases are under treatment, till Wednesday.

The urban circle, which has reported 43,832 positive cases with 42,806 recoveries and 1,004 deaths so far, remains the primary concern of the administration. With active cases reporting from different parts of the city, officials have decided to intensify the activities induced to make the crowd comply with Covid appropriate behaviour. "With markets witnessing crowd due to the festivals the incident commanders and officials concerned have been asked to ramp up the measures to see that Covid protocols are followed appropriately," ACMO added. Garments, footwear and jewellery shopkeepers have said regulations to check crowding and social distancing is a welcome step but restricted lockdown on Sunday should be lifted to help the sellers and the buyers, till festival season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-testing-must-at-checkpoints-ahead-of-diwali-chhath/articleshow/87193146.cms||---

Malo Devi died when cops allegedly broke into her house. The door of her house broke and fell on her. The cops even allegedly thrashed her and her family members. Talking to reporters on Thursday, her granddaughter Prabha Kumari (15) accused the police of atrocity which led to her death. Deputy commissioner Madhavi Mishra said thehat cause of her death could only be ascertained after the post mortem. “Probe would be ordered if any physical injury is found in the autopsy report and the guilty would certainly be punished,” she added. “Additional security forces have been deployed in the village and situation is tense but under control,” she said, adding that she had spoken to Ramgarh SP Prabhat Kumar who denied any wrongdoing by the police in the area. BJP state president Deepak Prakash, who also visited the village in the evening, demanded the accused cops be booked for murder under the Section 302 of the IPC. “This is utter Ravan raaj in the state. The woman died after the door fell on her and because the cops thrashed her. We demand strict action against the guilty cops,” he told TOI over phone. Ramgarh MLA Mamata Devi met DIG (North Chhotanagpur division) Narendra Kumar Singh in this regard. On the other hand, Ajsu Party’s Giridih MP Chandra Prakash Chaudhary, who is a native of Chitarpur block in the district, on Thursday visited Devi’s house to take stock of the situation. Later while talking to media persons, Chaudhary said that police have been treating villagers like militants and breaking their homes’ doors in the name of search operation in Barkipona village. Former BJP MP Yadunath Pandey also met the family members of the deceased and said the burning of Ravana’s effigy is a religious issue and the administration should avoid any kind of atrocity.  Two police officials, including deputy superintendent of police Sanjiv Kumar Mishra and Rajrappa police station in-charge Vipin Kumar, were injured in a clash during Dussehera when they tried to stop the burning of the effigy citing Covid-induced curbs. Around 26 villagers were arrested in this connection and more raids are on, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/elderly-woman-dies-during-search-operation-by-police/articleshow/87193167.cms||N K Agarwal

An announcement was made during a webinar attended by deputy head of mission Netherlands, Anneke Adema and state’s secretary for rural development, Manish Ranjan on Wednesday evening. Most of the selected women had lost their jobs during the pandemic but they turned their adversities into opportunity to distribute masks, sanitary pads and food grains in different districts. Twenty-year-old Chuman Kumari used to work as a maid in Delhi when the pandemic struck. She was forced to return home after losing work. She, however, got in touch with a non-government organisation, Bal Kalyan Sangh. Kumari also rendered service for distribution of essential materials among needy families in Khunti district. She said, “I am very happy that my efforts are recognised and awarded.” A group of 30 girls received training as security guard in December 2020 out of which a majority had come back to state after losing jobs. Most of them are in much better condition and have secured jobs in different private and public organisations, she added. Twenty-six-year-old Basanti Kacchap, who was rescued from trafficking several years ago, was deployed as a security guard in a government school. She also lost her job during the pandemic but utilised the time to serve families facing chances of trafficking, child labour and child marriage. The girls have distributed sanitary pads, dry ration and masks among over 2,600 needy families in Khunti, Koderma, Ranchi and East Singhbhum districts under the banner of BKS. The deputy head of the embassy also said that BKS is playing an important role in preventing trafficking of women from Jharkhand. The embassy also listed BKS among the best six organisations for prevention of human trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/netherlands-embassy-hails-15-women-for-their-contribution-to-society/articleshow/87193116.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Rajmahal Hills tribal areas face extinction threat due to rampant mining||Dumka: Indiscriminate stone mining along Rajmahal Hills in Santhal Parganas is not only proving to be detrimental to the local age-old fossils, but is also posing a threat of extinction to the indigenous Pahadiya community. Sourya Pahadiyas (one of the different sects of the Pahadiya community) of Chhoti Pachrukhi village in Borio block of Sahebganj district are compelled today to live under constant environmental degradation in the area coupled with shrinking opportunities for agriculture and livelihood due to illegal mining. As explosions are carried out frequently in dozens of stone-mining units in the vicinity, Chhoti Pachrukhi and its surrounding villages have become accustomed to recurrent earth vibrations. "It feels as if earthquakes are taking place whenever an explosion occurs in the stone quarries around our village. It poses a threat to our thatched cottages," said Surya Pahadiya, a local activist. Dust particles emanating from stone crusher plants are damaging the local flora and fauna as well, he added. "Due to rampant mining activities, all natural streams on the hilltops have either dried up or on the verge of getting extinct. These used to be the sole source of drinking water and irrigation," said Pahadiya, adding that the practice of his community members to procure forest produce to sell them for sustenance has equally been affected. Sahebganj and Pakur districts are famous for the existence of rare fossils. According to assistant professor of geology department, Sahebganj College, Ranjeet Kumar, the fossils date back to over one hundred million years. "It is a matter of serious concern. The rare fossils, which can throw light on the existence of life of that era, are being excavated indiscriminately and transported in large scale to far-off places," he said. Kumar suggested that the indiscriminate mining activity should be immediately stopped to save the endangered tribal groups and the local biodiversity. Several villages like Chhoti Pachrukhi, Amjola, Pangdo, Dhokuti and Gurmi are facing the menace with the administrative stakeholders turning a blind eye to the issue. “I am left with no other option but to mobilise locals and forcibly close all illegal mining and crusher plants in Sahebganj district," Lobin Hembrom, JMM MLA from Borio, told TOI over phone. Hembrom recently had launched an agitation by blocking the transportation of stone chips and raising the issue on the floor of the assembly. District mining officer Vibhuti Kumar denied having any information about the plights of the Pahadiya community. However, he assured that appropriate steps will be taken against illegal mining. “Efforts are also on to stop all kinds of illegal mining,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rajmahal-hills-tribal-areas-face-extinction-threat-due-to-rampant-mining/articleshow/87193056.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

As of now, 200 visitors are coming to Dalma everyday but the numbers are expected to rise steadily in the coming weeks, officials said. “The visitors usually start coming during the Puja break and in winter, the number rises substantially,” said divisional forest officer (DFO), Dalma, Abhishek Kumar. The official said since the footfall brings earning opportunity to the youths living in the surrounding foothills, the tourist count is important. “Youths, living in the villages in the foothills, earn some money working as guides while some of them open makeshift shops to sell soft drinks and snacks,” added the official. With good monsoon rains filling all the water bodies atop the hill, visitors enjoy watching elephants cool off in the ponds and playing with each other. “All the 10 guest rooms were booked during the Pujas and enquiries for the November are also coming in,” said a booking official at the range office in Dalma. The sanctuary management has made sure all the visitors coming to unwind comply with Covid-safety guidelines. Social distancing, masking and hand sanitation are compulsory for the visitors at the sanctuary, the DFO said. “The rooms are daily sanitised,” he said. The authorities had opened the gates for the visitors in July this year but the response was lukewarm. It surged from the Pujas. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the count of the visitors at the sanctuary was 33,000, 36,000 and 40,000, respectively. Spread across 192 sq km of area, the sanctuary, nestled in the lap of the nature, is a preferred destination for nature lovers. Predominantly, it’s an elephant sanctuary but it also has animals like sloth beer, mongoose, barking deer, wild pigs and birds of varying species in plenty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/post-unlock-dalma-sanctuary-sees-rise-in-tourist-footfall/articleshow/87193190.cms||B Sridhar

This will be Banerjee’s first visit outside Bengal after winning a third term as CM. She is being projected as the alternative to PM Narendra Modi following Trinamool’s impressive win over BJP in the assembly polls. Ahead of Goa assembly polls scheduled next year, Trinamool is also gearing up to increase its strength after former Goa CM and ex-Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro recently joined Trinamool in Kolkata along with several other leaders. Banerjee is likely to stay in Mumbai the preceding night.

The test was intended to validate aspects of one of the Pentagon's hypersonic glide vehicles in development, two of the people said. Hypersonic glide vehicles are launched from a rocket in the upper atmosphere before gliding to a target at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour. In a separate series of tests on Wednesday, the US Navy and Army tested hypersonic weapon component prototypes. That test successfully "demonstrated advanced hypersonic technologies, capabilities, and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment," the Pentagon said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rocket-failure-delays-us-hypersonic-weapon-test-say-sources/articleshow/87195828.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh accounts for more than 12% of India's 100 crore vaccine jabs||LUCKNOW: As India crossed the milestone of 100 crore Covid-19 doses, the share of UP, with 12.3 crore jabs, stood at more than 12%, which is highest in the country. Maharashtra, with over 9.3 crore doses and West Bengal with 6.9 crore doses are the next two states in terms of total inoculations. In UP, 9.48 crore persons have taken the first dose while 2.83 crore are fully vaccinated. This means that 81% of the 15.04 crore eligible persons in UP have taken at least one dose while 18.4% are fully vaccinated. Experts appreciated the enormity of the work undertaken in UP, especially in the light of factors like limited availability of vaccines, Union government's vaccination priority to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Kerala in early stages and the scale of implementation challenge in UP. "Credit for the achievement in Uttar Pradesh goes to its meticulous planning and strategy, exemplary political leadership and unparalleled commitment displayed by frontline workers," said Prof Manindra Agarwal, faculty at IIT Kanpur, who has studied the Covid-19 control measures in UP. He also credited the people state for the success. "The efforts would have gone in vain had the people of the state not shown their trust in the system and shunned all kinds of negative propaganda against the vaccine." In an interview with TOI in June, CM Yogi Adityanath had claimed UP would administer 10 crore doses in three months starting July. The state achieved the target on September 25. Also, in less than a month since the milestone, the state has been able to provide another 2 crore doses. The government rolled out micro-plans covering key elements of awareness, mobilization, supportive supervision for registration, eliminating digital divide and taking the vaccination camps to villages instead of making people run to centers. Health minister Jai Pratap Singh congratulated front line workers for the feat. "In many districts, health workers rose above odds to serve people," he said. Meanwhile, 12 new cases and 14 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-accounts-for-more-than-12-of-indias-100-crore-vaccine-jabs/articleshow/87195865.cms||Shailvee Sharda

On Friday Truss will meet Yadav in Delhi to discuss climate targets just days before the COP26 summit kicks off in Glasgow. "She will underline the importance of making concrete progress on climate change and will note that India already leads the world in renewable technology and express her hope that they will commit to a more ambitious nationally determined contribution," a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson said. Truss will announce a £11.5 million (Rs 119 crore) UK investment in two venture capital funds aimed at supporting India’s transition to cleaner energy, a £50.4 million (Rs 521 crore) investment by the FCDO’s investment arm, CDC, to fund green tech infrastructure projects across India, and a £500,000 (Rs 5.2 crore) UK investment to build a virtual network of UK and Indian labs working to promote net zero targets in industries including glass, cement, and metals. "I want the UK and India to step up their partnership in critical areas like technology, investment, security and defence," Truss said. "India is the world’s largest democracy, a tech and economic powerhouse and a vital strategic partner for the UK. Closer ties — including in areas like tech and infrastructure — will deliver jobs and growth in both countries, boost developing world economies and help us promote our values on the global stage," she added. Truss will meet Jaishankar in Delhi when they will announce a new strategic futures forum, bringing together leading figures from government, business and academia in both countries, to drive closer links in areas like tech and security and shape the long-term vision for the UK-India partnership. On Saturday Truss will be in Mumbai where she will visit the UK Carrier Strike Group on its most substantial port visit to date and speak to Indian business leaders at a "Build Back Better World" roundtable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-foreign-secretary-to-announce-green-tech-clean-energy-investments-hope-for-greater-nationally-determined-contribution-during-india-trip/articleshow/87195873.cms||NAOMI CANTON

In a Tweet, the Bengal FM has urged the Prime Minister to issue a white paper on this in the Parliament. Mitra tweeted that 35,000 high networth Indian entrepreneurs have left the country between 2014-2020, as immigrants, during the Narendra Modi government regime. “India ranked No. 1 in exodus in the world …... why? ‘Fear psychosis’?? PM must place white paper to Parliament on the massive flight of Indian entrepreneurs during his Regime,” Mitra wrote. The Bengal FM said, in 2014-2018, as many as 23,000 high net worth entrepreneurs left India as per Morgan Stanley study, which he claimed as the worst in the world. Mitra pointed out that 7,000 left India in 2019 alone and 5,000 left India in 2020 as per the Global Wealth Migration Report of 2020 (for 2019). The GWM Review data said that 2% or 7,000 of India’s HNI pool left the country in 2019 for greener pastures. This wealth migration list is topped by China with 16,000 millionaire exits, followed by India at 7,000 and Russia at 5,500 HNI exits. Mitra also criticized Union commerce minister Piyush Goel by saying, “Recall 19 minutes of tirade against Indian business by Piyush Goel, reportedly saying business practices of Indian industry went against national interest — short of calling them anti national.” He feels such type of remarks breed ‘fear psychosis’, motivating exodus. “But, the PM did not rebuke Goel. Why?” he asked. Goel made this remarks at a CII meeting in August this year. Questioning domestic businesses’ priorities and commitment towards India, Goyal even challenged Tata Steel to demonstrate if they can sell their products in Japan and Korea, arguing that companies in those countries are ‘nationalistic’ and won’t buy imported steel. Indian industry, by contrast, would import even if it helped them save just 10 paise in the finished cost of goods, and then lobby to avoid the levy of anti-dumping duties on such imports, he asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/over-35k-entrepreneurs-left-india-during-modi-regime-mitra/articleshow/87193041.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In 29 years, 15% more Indians became vulnerable to extreme heat: Study||NAGPUR: Almost 31% of India’s population was vulnerable to extreme heat in 2019, which is 15% higher than what it was in 1990. Also, India is one of the five countries with the highest exposure of vulnerable populations over the past 5 years. This was revealed in the Lancet Countdown’s sixth annual report which highlights that last year senior citizens were affected by 3.1 billion more days of heatwave exposure, compared to the 1986–2005 baseline average. Chinese, Indian, American, Japanese and Indonesian senior citizens were the most affected. Representing the consensus of leading researchers from 38 academic institutions and United Nations agencies, the report showed that many countries are under-prepared for the health effects of climate change. The data also measured the effect of heatwaves on people’s mental health by analysing over six billion tweets over last five years from Twitter users around the world. The researchers found a 155% increase in negative expressions during heatwaves in 2020 relative to the 2015-2019 average. The report further stressed that the five years with the most areas affected by extreme drought have all occurred since 2015. “Climate change is driving an increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of drought events, threatening water security, sanitation, and food productivity, and increasing the risk of wildfires and exposure to pollutants. The crisis also threatens to accelerate food insecurity, which affected 2 billion people in 2019,” it stated. Another worrying news is the increase of average sea surface temperature in the territorial waters of nearly 70% (95 out of 136) of coastal countries analysed, compared to 2003-2005. “This reflects an increasing threat to their marine food security. Worldwide 3.3 billion people depend on marine food,” the report added. It also found that globally, climate change adaptation funding directed at health systems represents just 0.3% of total climate change adaptation funding. “Climate change is here and we’re already seeing it damaging human health across the world,” said Anthony Costello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown. Adding that every country is facing some aspect of the climate crisis, Costello added, “The 2021 report shows that populations of 134 countries have experienced an increase in exposure to wildfires. Millions of farmers and construction workers could have lost income because on some days it’s just too hot for them to work. Drought is more widespread than ever before. The Lancet Countdown’s report has over 40 indicators and far too many of them are flashing red.” Stating that we are still not seeing the accelerated change we need, lead author of the report Maria Romanello said: “At best the trends in emissions, renewable energy and tackling pollution have improved only very slightly. This year we saw people suffering intense heatwaves, deadly floods and wildfires. These are grim warnings that for every day that we delay our response to climate change, the situation gets more critical.” WHAT REPORT SAYS- 31% of India population was vulnerable to extreme heat in 2019 - India 1 of the 5 countries with the highest exposure of vulnerable populations over the past 5 years - Five years with the most areas affected by extreme drought have all occurred since 2015 - Populations of 134 countries have experienced an increase in exposure to wildfires - Climate change adaptation funding directed at health systems represents just 0.3% of total climate change adaptation funding||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-29-years-15-more-indians-became-vulnerable-to-extreme-heat-study/articleshow/87193160.cms||Manka Behl

Wadettiwar’s startling disclosure came while campaigning for Congress candidate Jitesh Antapurkar for Deglur assembly constituency bypolls in Nanded district. The Bramhapuri MLA claimed that he had a meeting with a city MP recently for funding various road projects. “Nagpur citizens are very well aware that their two big leaders are at loggerheads. Gadkari told me that he wanted to teach him a lesson and had succeeded,” Wadettiwar alleged, without mentioning who was “him”. After the minister’s statement was flashed across the media, Gadkari issued a statement in the evening making it clear that he never uttered anything against Fadnavis to Wadettiwar, openly or secretly. “I was surprised to see his (Wadettiwar) totally false and baseless claims. Fadnavis is like a younger brother to me and one of the important leaders of our party. It is the tradition of the Congress to fight against each other and pull legs. Wadettiwar is trying to create confusion among us,” the BJP heavyweight said. Lauding Fadnavis’ work, Gadkari added that during his tenure as chief minister, the state made rapid progress on all fronts, and now also he was doing a marvellous job in the opposition. “He is playing the role of a responsible opposition leader by exposing the wrongdoings by Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Though Congress is one of the constituents in MVA, its leaders are frustrated, as they are ignored and side-lined by others (Shiv Sena and NCP). Therefore, leaders like Wadettiwar are making such false statements to create misunderstandings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-irresponsible-baseless-comments-gadkari-to-wadettiwar/articleshow/87193230.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Congratulating all health workers and frontline workers on achieving 100 crore jabs, the CM reiterated that vaccination and Covid-19 prevention protocols were the only keys to stay ahead of the pandemic virus. He also appealed to people of the state to stay extra cautious during the festive season to ensure individual safety and contribute towards the well-being of all.  "The Covid-19 vaccine is the shot of life and it is a matter of great pride that UP has been able to make the biggest contribution in India's vaccine century," the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/credit-for-100-crore-vaccination-milestone-goes-to-pm-narendra-modi-health-staff-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/87195989.cms||---

It had planned to give out the operation of three new jumbo centres at Malad, Sion and Kanjurmarg along with a part of those in BKC and Dahisar to private agencies. Expecting a third wave, the BMC had set up close to 6,000 beds, including 738 for ICU and 200 for paediatric cases across five centres. "We had invited an expression of interest (EoI) asking private agencies and hospitals to come forward to run these jumbo centres for three months. Due procedure was followed and we got responses from private players. Five agencies were picked and approval from the standing committee was taken. But we have not issued the work orders yet, since there are no cases. So, for now, the operations of these jumbo centres have been kept on hold," said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). BMC to issue work orders for jumbo Covid centres when there is needWe have followed a very transparent mechanism and we will issue the work orders when there is a need and cases rise," Kakani said. Jumbo centres in Malad, Kanjurmarg and Somaiya Grounds in Sion were constructed recently keeping in mind the possibility of a third wave. That apart, officials said the BMC set up 100 additional ICU beds at the BKC centre and 730 beds at Dahisar. Officials said the centres in Malad, Kanjurmarg and Sion were constructed by MMRDA, Mhada and Cidco. The BMC's standing committee had cleared a proposal to appoint private agencies to run these jumbo Covid centres for a period of three months. BMC officials said private agencies were to run the jumbo centres for three months or till the time the third wave ended. The BMC was to spend Rs 104.9 crore on the operation of 5,808 beds across these five jumbo centres. BMC officials said the Malad jumbo centre would be the biggest out of the five, with 2,170 beds, including 190 ICU and 1,536 oxygen-supported beds. There are 1,700 beds in Kanjurmarg, and 1,100 beds in the Sion centre. So far, the BMC has spent over Rs 2,000 crore on fighting the pandemic. Several purchases by the BMC have faced allegations of corruption and irregularities. The BJP has demanded a white paper on the BMC's spending on Covid-19. "Despite writing several letters and asking questions, the BMC has failed to submit details of contracts. Almost every purchase has been rigged and there has been a massive siphoning of money in the name of the pandemic. A majority of the contracts were awarded without floating tenders. This is how builders bagged contracts to build jumbo centers. The BMC must come clean and present a white paper on all Covid expenses," said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-puts-new-jumbo-centres-in-cold-storage/articleshow/87195990.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Confirming this, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the NMC had floated tenders to appoint a private agency to build eight floors comprising a shopping mall, restaurant and a multiplex with rooftop eatery. The mall, which was the phase-I scheme of the Orange City Street project, will be a public-private partnership project. The NMC had floated tenders in October 2019. The NMC had set a base price of Rs 45 crore for the 35,000 sqm land where the mall will be constructed. There were four bidders. “Of them, we got Praful Ved Infrastructure Company Limited which evinced interest in the project and agreed to pay Rs55 crore to the NMC,” said executive engineer (Project) Naresh Borkar. The NMC had signed MoU with MahaMetro for the mall on December 20, 2018. It was supposed to complete the project in 18 months. The NMC had first estimated the project cost at Rs40 crore. With MahaMetro’s appointment to execute the project, its cost increased to Rs55 crore. The NMC had also paid Rs 11 crore to MahaMetro as part payment. Metro started the construction and completed it up to plinth level. “Once the mall is complete, the Orange City Street project will definitely get a boost,” said the civic chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-finds-firm-to-build-metro-mall-to-get-rs10cr-extra-revenue/articleshow/87192283.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

After seven years, a surgery and several cycles of chemotherapy, Murai decided not to rest or quit. She started her own business. Murai, now 75 years old, is popular for her pickles as well as her struggle and victory over breast cancer. “We make authentic Rajasthani pickles here in Nagpur. Internet has made us popular. Now, I am getting orders right from Rajasthan,” she said. Dr Manisha Mishra, consultant oncopathologist at Rashtra Sant Tukadoji Cancer Regional Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, said, “Though it was detected at an early stage, her (Murai) age was on the higher side. She fought the cancer bravely. Today, she has found a new life and new aim too.” As many as 16 women patients, who defeated breast cancer and got a new lease of life, shared their experiences with the patients and media at a breast cancer survivor’s summit held at the RST RCH on Wednesday. All the participants stressed on early detection and treatment of cancer. Dr Kartar Singh, director of the RST RCH said that as October is celebrated as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the hospital invites survivors to encourage patients in their fight against cancer. “Patients who are living a good life for more than 10 years are specially invited. If detected early, breast cancer gives you all the chance to live a normal life,” he said. Dr BK Sharma, honorary consultant at the RST RCH, said that several lifestyle-related factors are responsible for increased cases of breast cancer. “They include wrong eating habits and addictions apart from decreased breastfeeding and late pregnancies due to modern lifestyle. Secondly, genetic factors do play an important role,” he said adding that girls whose immediate female relatives had breast cancer should be more careful and get themselves tested regularly from the age of 30. In words of Shubhangi Sarve, 48, who recovered from breast cancer in 2015 and is now living a happy life with her family, “Breast cancer is the best cancer. With my family support, it was a journey that gave me a great sense of achievement. I feel like a winner and living with this feeling for the last five years,” she said. # Pandemic effect Reported cases of breast cancer declined from 430 (2019) to 307 (2020) in Nagpur This is because patients failed to reach hospital during Covid-19 pandemic Total registrations of cancer patients declined from 5,399 to 3,884 Now in 2021, patients are coming to hospitals in later stage of cancer Late presentation and treatment results in serious disease, complications Doctors have appealed to women not to ignore the signs of breast cancer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/detect-breast-cancer-early-to-lead-normal-life/articleshow/87192330.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

During the hearing on Thursday, the division bench of the high court comprising Justices Revati Mohite Dere and M S Jawalkar stated that the teachers are not being compelled to take the vaccine as they have been given the option of producing RT-PCR certificates at their own expense, and must cooperate. Advocate general Devidas Pangam said that individual rights should be kept aside in this issue and the bench added that the mandatory testing is in the interest of protecting the health of the students. The bench said that vaccination is compulsory even in case of employment and asked the advocate general whether any other courts have passed orders in similar matters. Advocate Gaurish Malik representing the petitioners sought an early hearing for interim relief for the teachers stating that schools have already started in the offline mode and in the wake of the second circular issued by the directorate of education. The petitioners have submitted that the Union of India and the ICMR are yet to file their responses to their writ petition and added that taking a RT-PCR test every week, even if they don’t show any symptoms, “will cause them severe health problems”. “They will also have to bear the expense for the RT-PCR every week thereby causing them financial hardships whereas no such compulsion is levied on the students. Private laboratories charge an average of Rs 2,500 per RT-PCR test.” They have also submitted to the high court that they are made to stand in the queue with symptomatic patients and sometimes are being driven off from the testing centre and told to report only if they have symptoms. The petitioners have produced an RTI reply from the ICMR stating that “repeated testing at very frequent intervals can lead to injury in nasal cavity and throat”. They have also stated that doctors at Covid-19 hospitals and at Goa Medical College who come in close proximity with positive patients are more vulnerable to the infection, but no circulars on similar lines have been issued by the directorate of health services for them. The teaching and non-teaching staff have suggested that other precautionary measures be adopted and that the government make a provision for free RT-PCR testing facilities. They are also seeking stay on the circulars of the directorate of education. The latest circular issued by the directorate of education on October 8 regarding conducting of offline exams for secondary schools lists out conditions that must be strictly adhered to. It stated that only vaccinated staff (teaching and non-teaching both) shall be allowed on the school premises. “Those who cannot produce a vaccination certificate shall be allowed after producing the negative report of the RT-PCR test. Such report shall be valid for seven days and a fresh report shall be produced after the seventh day,” director of education Bhushan K Savaikar stated in the circular. The petition will come up for hearing next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teachers-cant-endanger-students-lives-says-hc-on-plea-against-vax/articleshow/87193568.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa polls among first to have pre-checks on EVMs||PANAJI: The pre-first level checking unit (P-FLCU) will be used for the first time in Goa and Manipur during the upcoming general elections, chief electoral officer Kunal stated. The unit is an accessory designed to test EVM units like Control Unit (CU) and Ballot Unit (BU) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) prior to conducting the first level checks. The accessory unit is used to capture diagnostic data from EVM/VVPAT units and to set the real-time clock data of the control unit, the chief electoral officer stated. After a pre-first level check (P-FLC), the entire process of first level checking of EVMs and VVPATs will take place. The general election to the Goa legislative assembly will be conducted on M3 EVM/VVPATs. The M3 EVMs have all the technical security features of earlier models with additional advanced technical features like UADM (unauthorised access detection module), self diagnostics for EVMs health, strong mutual authentication of CU, BU and VVPAT, battery life prediction and a single CU able to cater to 24 BUs to accommodate 384 candidates. The machines are sleeker and lighter in weight enabling ease of handling by the election personnel.

They said that while the pandemic has led to loss of livelihoods for parents of most of the students from rural areas, the hike in exam fee has exerted additional financial burden on them. They have urged the board and the government to reconsider the hike and provide relief to the students and their parents at the earliest. As per the board’s circular, the examination fees without late fees is Rs 1,200, it is up from Rs 1,050 prescribed by the board for the April 2021 exams. For applications with late fees, the students have to pay an additional Rs 500, and fees for statement of marks and passing certificate have been raised to Rs 300 from the previous Rs 200. Practical exam fees have not been changed. As per the schedule of payments, the fees (without late fees) have to be paid by November 1, while for applications with late fees the last date is November 8. A senior teacher of an aided school from Curchorem who requested anonymity, termed the hike “unfair”. “I know many students whose parents find it unaffordable to pay the exam fees. Instead of considering lowering the fees in view of the pandemic, the board has hiked the fees, which is totally unjustified. This will only result in many students preferring not to apply for answering the exams,” he said. Moved by the plight of some of the poor students of his school, the teacher paid the exam fees of four of them. “The board should immediately rollback the hike, and if possible, lower them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parents-upset-over-rs-150-hike-in-ssc-exam-fees/articleshow/87193627.cms||---

Dilip Naik, who led the delegation, told reporters that they have also asked Sardesai to aesthetically renovate the traffic circle “from an architectural point of view”. Pramod Naik, a member of the group, said that as various parts of Fatorda have been developed, it is only appropriate that a landmark location of the town is named in Dambab’s honour. “The Mhadd area of Fatorda is known as Dambab’s place. As the traffic circle is located in this area, on behalf of people of Margao and Fatorda, I request the Fatorda MLA to consider our demand and get going with the work,” he said. Sardesai assured the delegation that he would get a resolution in that regard passed by the Margao Municipal Council. “There’s no reason to reject the demand of Dambab’s bhakts. Let’s also take prasad from Lord Dambab at the Zambaulim temple as regards the choice of the name for the circle and get it done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/devotees-want-margao-traffic-circle-named-after-dambab/articleshow/87193637.cms||---
---||Goa||‘CM abused power to disqualify rival Sakhali councillors’||Panaji: Congress on Thursday alleged that chief minister Pramod Sawant misused his power to disqualify two councillors of the Sakhali Municipal Council with a plan to gain control over the council and also to reap benefits in the assembly polls. “When candidates supported by his panel lost, the rival winners were offered money. But when our councillors did not dither, cases were filed against them,” Chodankar alleged. As a result, the councillors have been forced to approach the court seeking justice. Recently, a complaint was filed against two Congress-backed councillors — Raya Parsekar and Rajesh Sawal — and both were disqualified without proper grounds, he said. “Parsekar was disqualified on the grounds that he did not submit a proper income certificate, but it can’t be the basis of disqualification. In the case of Sawal, they alleged illegal construction by him that dated prior to his election as a councillor. In both cases, there was no ground for disqualification,” Chodankar said. When urban development minister Milind Naik declined to honour the chief minister’s request to disqualify the two councillors, the CM put a remark on the file that it be referred to the power minister, Chodankar alleged. “Where is the correlation between power minister and urban development? The power minister did not conduct a hearing but instructed the parties to file written replies and passed the order disqualifying the two,” he alleged. The state Congress president said that the two were disqualified without giving them a chance to present their case. The law of natural justice has been given a complete skip, he said. “This has been done because the mood in Sakhali (CM’s constituency) is such that Sawant will be defeated,” Chodankar said. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said that civic bodies are governed by acts, rules and regulations. “The fundamental question is, can a minister, who has nothing to do with urban development ministry, disqualify councillors. For municipal bodies, an urban development minister is a government. Under no circumstances does any other minister have the power to pass orders,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-abused-power-to-disqualify-rival-sakhali-councillors/articleshow/87193666.cms||---
