Under the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act-1999, tendering exemptions are given up to Rs 5 lakh. The order was reissued on October 7. Since 2001, the orders have been repeatedly reissued for emergency works in the state. The RDPR had not renewed the order since 2016 thereby creating “legal” concerns over handing smaller works to contractors on an “ad-hoc” basis at gram panchayat level. While the intention behind allowing infrastructure works below Rs 5 lakh was to ensure speedy dispensation of emergency works, the purpose, since then, has been distorted and used every so frequently by the political class to hand over works in “bits and pieces” to their supporters. “Most of the time, it is unavoidable that a legislator will ask the local officials to hand the work to his supporters. Unless the exemption is withdrawn, there is no way out of systematic corruption,” said a government official, citing that maximum piece works are awarded for road repair and maintenance in panchayat areas. The October 7 order issued by RDPR also makes note of the possible division of works or projects to avoid tendering and has said that “strict disciplinary action” will be initiated against those trying to do so.However, RDPR principal secretary LK Atheeq said the exemption under section 4 (e) and (ee) of the KTPP is a much required leeway to complete works faster. “When one considers the process and time involved to call for a tender and award the contract for a small work, it does not make sense. The order by the department is not a fresh one. The leeway to award works for Rs 5 lakh or below was there from the beginning,” said Atheeq. According to officials, the RDPR reissued the order now as the finance department raised objections to the expenditure towards the piece works done without a legal document to prove the reasons behind giving it to one particular person or contractor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rdpr-dept-reissues-2016-order-on-smaller-works-to-evade-tendering/articleshow/87091475.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Captain Joshi’s father Harish Joshi, who had been camping in Mamun Cantt after the crash waiting for his son’s body, told TOI that they were informed by the Army authorities that their son’s body was recovered from the Ranjit Sagar lake around 1.30pm on Sunday. “The body is intact though it has decomposed a bit and is bloated since it has remained in the water body for so long. The Army authorities have brought his body to the Pathankot Military Hospital for the post-mortem examination,” he added. After the wreath-laying ceremony in Pathankot on Monday, the mortal remains of Captain Joshi, 27, will be flown to Delhi. As his parents wish to take the final journey of their son from their house at Dwarka in Delhi on Tuesday, the Army authorities may keep the mortal remains in the Delhi Military Hospital on Monday night. Defence PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said, “Due to the expanse and depth of the dam, the search and rescue team has to use state of the art multi beam sonar equipment to scan the lake bed. Based on the inputs received, the remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) with robotic arm and professional divers were launched to search the area. The body was detected at a depth of 65-70m.” The helicopter, belonging to the 254 Army Aviation Squadron of the Mamun Cantt in Pathankot, crashed into the reservoir in the Ranjit Sagar Dam lake along the Jammu-Punjab border on August 3 along with two pilots. The chopper took off from the Pathankot cantonment and crashed within minutes. On August 15, the body of one pilot was recovered after 12 days while search for the body of Captain Jayant Joshi continued. Search operation continued unabated while expertise of the Army, Navy, IAF, NDRF, SDRF, NGOs, State Police, Dam Authority and private firms from all over the country were put into action. Captain Joshi’s mother, Colonel Jiwan Tara is in the Military Nursing Service (MNS) and has completed over 40 years of service. Captain Joshi was inspired by her to join the Army.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rudra-chopper-crash-body-of-captain-joshi-recovered-from-jk-dam-after-75-days/articleshow/87091478.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

V Manjunath, a lathe operator from Sathanur in Kanakapura, and M Roja, 28, from Malavalli in Mandya, married four years ago. They would reportedly fight often over his consuming alcohol, her family told police. “They shifted to a rented house in Tigalarapalya earlier this year. Manjunath allegedly beat Roja regularly,” police said. They added: “On Sunday, afternoon, neighbours heard Manjunath and Roja fighting and Roja screaming and shouting. In the evening, a neighbour alerted the police control room that the main door was bolted from inside and the couple was not responding to his knock.” An investigating officer said: “We found Manjunath hanging and Roja lying dead on the floor.

---||Bengaluru||Plea: Count those under-18 as kids||Bengaluru: A Bengaluru-based child rights activist has started a petition seeking that individuals below the age of 18 must be considered as children in the census instead of only those below six years.Vasudev Sharma, director of Child Rights Trust, who started the petition, said the census data is quoted extensively by the public, researchers, government officials and the media. “This limits the scope and importance of enumerating and analysing child population and consequently affects any planning concerning them,” he said. According to the petition, some official documents consider children as below 10 or 12 or 14 years and some others go up to 16 years. Laws such as the National Policy for Children-2013, the Child Marriage Prohibition Act-2006, the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act-1986 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act-2015, define persons below 18 as children. While the petition urges to change the definition of the child in all their data, it also seeks a sub-grouping of child population within this age category such those below 6, between 6-14 and 14-18 with respect to urban, tribal and rural areas along with gender, disability, literacy, labour, marital status and education.“Such a move would enable those working with figures on children to easily access data under-18 child population at the country, state, district, taluk, urban local bodies and panchayat levels. This would revolutionise the process of future planning, developing plan of actions, fund allocation, programming and also monitoring the progress of schemes for children,” read the petition.“This process would enable the government to evaluate the status of children and see if it is moving towards realising the state development goals, said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/plea-count-those-under-18-as-kids/articleshow/87091497.cms||---

On Saturday, the seven-floor B unit of the police quarters, constructed by Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation and home to 32 families, tilted by about 1.5 feet at least. The families were shifted to another police quarters near Annapoorneshwarinagar in Nagarbavi. According to police sources, the expert committee has been directed to submit a detailed on report what caused the building to tilt, at the earliest. “Home minister Araga Jnanendra has taken the issue very seriously. We will submit our first report by Wednesday. Also, engineers and other experts have been directed to inspect if the tilted structure can be repaired and its occupants can continue to live there. In case the building is declared unfit for human habitation, a case will be registered against the builder concerned. Already the builder has been directed to submit details of the materials used in construction,” a senior IPS officer said. Families of policemen from the ranks of constable to sub-inspector reside in the three units —A, B and C — in the apartment. While unit A was occupied by 2018-end, B and C were inaugurated in mid-2019. A total of 192 flats are available in the three units.“Families are still shifting their belongings. It may take another two-three days to fully vacate the building,” a senior police officer said.“Construction standards of police quarters across the state are generally questionable. Quarters in Bengaluru and other important cities are much better compared to those in other districts. It is high time the state of buildings, including police quarters, police stations, and other establishments was examined. Surprisingly, buildings related to offices of IPS officers have better materials compared to other structures,” an occupant of the tilted building told TOI.“Gaps and cracks were noticed on the structure much earlier. We tried to bring the matter to the notice of officials concerned, but in vain,” said another occupant living in unit B.Additional director general of police, Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation, AS Murthy was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/experts-check-if-tilted-police-building-can-be-salvaged-residents-move-out/articleshow/87091502.cms||---

The injured is Mohammed Nadeem,21, a factory employee. He alleged that Kumar, Deepu and Farhan, all residents of Kareemsab Layout, attacked him and his four fingers of left hand were fractured. A few days ago Farhan had tied a friendship band to him and he was wearing it. After three days, Farhan asked for his band. Nadeem told him he will return it after a few days. The duo had an argument over the issue. On October 14 night, Nadeem was talking to two of his other friends near a tea shop. Farhan along with Kumar and Deepu came to the spot and asked him to purchase cigarettes for them. Nadeem declined to buy the cigarettes and they began fighting with him. Kumar allegedly pulled out a machete and attacked him. The trio sped away on a bike from the spot. Rajagopalanagar police have taken up a case of attempt to murder and arrested Kumar and Deepu. Farhan is at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-friends-assault-youth-for-refusing-to-buy-cigarette-for-them/articleshow/87091504.cms||---

The suspect is Hasiya Khatun, 66, and efforts are on to nab another woman, who cheated the jewellery shop in a similar way a day earlier.Manjula V, an assistant manager with a jewellery shop, lodged a complaint with Yelahanka police against the duo. On October 11, a woman identifying herself as Prabha Srivastav visited the shop at 6.10 pm and expressed her interest to purchase a necklace by selling her old gold chain. Prabha gave her chain weighing around 34 grams and its price was fixed at slightly over Rs 1.4 lakh. The woman selected a necklace weighing around 21 grams and a pair of earrings weighing 6 grams. The total value of the new ornaments was about Rs 2,200 more than the price of her chain. Prabha was paid Rs 2,200 and walked away with the new jewellery. She had told the employees that her mother-in-law Khatun too wanted to give her old chain in exchange for new jewellery and said the latter would come the next day. Khatun came to the shop on October 12 but her luck ran out as the employees had found out by then that the chain given by Prabha was fake. The employees took the chain from Khatun and found that it was also fake. Yelahanka police reached the spot and arrested her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/elderly-woman-tries-to-sell-fake-gold-chain-nabbed/articleshow/87091505.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||80% jump in cases solved using fingerprints in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Three men brandishing a country-made pistol had barged into a jewellery shop on MES Road, Jalahalli, north Bengaluru in September 2020, and fled with articles worth Rs 90 lakh. Forensic experts managed to extract fingerprints of one suspect from the scene of crime and found that it matched with an old-time offender whose sample was already in the database. His arrest led police officials to two other accomplices and recovery of the entire booty intact. This was among the 207 cases cracked in 2020 by city police with the help of fingerprint verification. The year recorded a 80% jump in such breakthroughs over 2019 when 113 cases were solved. Though more cases were cracked using fingerprints in the state in 2020 than in 2019, the jump was not as pronounced as it was in Bengaluru. While 401 cases had been solved in 2019, the number rose by 25% to touch 527 the next year. Ordinary thefts, house burglaries, robberies, dacoities and rape cases are those usually solved using fingerprints. Recently, RT Nagar police arrested a couple on burglary charges and recovered 193 grams of gold from them. The couple had struck at a house in RT Nagar in August but left behind enough fingerprints at the scene of crime for cops to follow up. They were found to match a couple who had been arrested earlier and enlarged on bail in March this year. The RT Nagar break-in was the couple’s third offence. DCP (north) Dharmender Kumar Meena said preserving the crime scene is most important to get fingerprints of the suspects. Meena and his team have solved more than 10 cases, mostly house break-ins, with the help of fingerprints. He said people, out of anxiety, sometimes destroy fingerprints at crime scenes. “Victims would normally check the ransacked materials to ascertain the missing valuables. At such times, fingerprints will be destroyed. At many spots, we get partial fingerprints and they may match or not match with the old- time offenders. This is another challenge,” he added.  A senior officer said the Scene of Crime Officers (known as SOCO team) should be involved more during preliminary investigation. “SOCO officers are not from the police department. They are forensic science experts and are well trained in handling crime scenes and extracting fingerprints. This concept is new among state police and floated around five months ago. We hope they start joining the state police at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/80-jump-in-cases-solved-using-fingerprints-in-bluru/articleshow/87091559.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

As fighting resumed, the authorities sealed a highway running close to one of the encounter sites, sources said. Three suspects were detained in a simultaneous crackdown on locals accused of providing logistical support to the terrorists. Since the first of several gunfights took place in the Surankote area on October 11, the police and paramilitary forces have joined the Army in making inroads into the rough terrain of Bhatidhariyan in search of the fleeing terrorists. Elite para commandos of the Army and helicopters were deployed two days ago to help track them down. Interrogation of the three detained suspects, all of them residents of the area, could lead to a breakthrough soon, sources said. Two junior commissioned officers were among the nine Army personnel killed in action on October 11 as the fighting spread from Poonch to the adjoining frontier district of Rajouri. After suffering five casualties on the first day, the Army retrieved two bodies each from the forest on Friday and Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/amid-fresh-gunfight-in-poonch-3-detained-for-helping-terrorists-on-the-run/articleshow/87091620.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Doctors advise caution as flu cases rise in Bhubaneswar||BHUBANESWAR: Doctors here are witnessing an increase in the number of viral fever or influenza cases. Patients are suffering from high fever, fatigue, cough, cold and vomiting - symptoms that are similar to that of Covid-19, and as a result, many are opting for tests for Covid-19 as well as dengue. According to doctors, this is the season for flu outbreak, but people must take precautions against Covid-19 as well. “This is the season for influenza or flu outbreak, and many patients are coming with complaints of high fever, cough and cold, which are Covid-19-like symptoms. Many people confuse it with Covid-19, but when people go for a test, they may get a negative report for Covid-19. But it can be possible for a person to contract Covid-19 and flu at the same time. In such cases, they must consult a doctor immediately without going for self-medication,” said Dr Niraj Mishra, a senior physician. Health experts said flu or viral outbreaks are usually reported during September-October, and with the changing weather, other viral illnesses also crop up. “Both flu and Covid-19 are caused by viruses and have very similar symptoms. Of the four types of influenza viruses, except the swine flu, other three variants are active now. Though the severity or mortality rate in influenza is not as high as Covid-19, but it can be risky without proper and timely medical intervention. Besides, those vulnerable groups like asthmatic people and senior citizens should go for the flu vaccine to avoid infection,” Dr Mishra added. Sources said most hospitals in the city are receiving patients with complaints of high fever, cough, cold and running nose. Of the total patient flow at the outdoor patient department (OPD), around 70 per cent are coming with complaints of fever, cough and cold. “Since the symptoms are similar with that of Covid-19, we are doing Covid-19 tests of all, but around 5-6 patients are testing positive, while the rest are flu patients. Some patients also have dengue,” said Dr Dhananjay Das, deputy superintendent of Capital Hospital. Since both Covid-19 and flu are contagious diseases and can spread through respiratory droplets of the infected persons, wearing masks and following hand hygiene practices can help in spreading the diseases, doctors have advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/docs-advise-caution-as-flu-cases-rise-in-city/articleshow/87091682.cms||Minati Singha

They missed their annual High School Certificate (HSC) examination 2021 and could attend only 80 days of school in the past 18 months. Some of them could be in a difficult situation owing to Covid-19. They need to be welcomed and counselled regarding the academic, curricular and co-curricular activities,” the school and mass education secretary wrote to all the principals of the higher secondary schools. One guardian or parent can accompany each student on the first day. A proctor, a mediator between the student and the institution, will let the students know about their subject combination, section, group and timetable. The fresher will be introduced to their respective proctors. “The students will also be informed about the new pattern of assessment, introduced by the Council of Higher Secondary Education (CHSE), from the current academic year. The students could be enlightened about the details of CCE and its benefits from Day-1. They should feel that it is introduced to lessen their burden as they will be well acquainted with the question pattern through tests and get to know about their continuous learning achievement for improvement,” the letter added. The teachers should plan to cover the concepts of Class X for easy understanding of the content to be taught in Class XI as normal schooling could not take place in previous class because of the pandemic. “Everyone must be vigilant and follow appropriate Covid-19 protocols during classes and also in hostels,” the letter added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/higher-secondary-schools-to-induct-freshers-on-thursday/articleshow/87091688.cms||Minati Singha

It aims to promote, develop and harness the potential of tourism in the country. “It is unfortunate that Odisha, even with its rich Buddhist tradition and shrines, has neither been included in the Buddhist Circuit nor has any project under the Swadesh Darshan scheme been allocated to Buddhist shrines in the state,” Pradhan wrote. Under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, the tourism ministry has sanctioned five projects worth Rs 325.53 crore for the development of Budhist Circuits in MP, UP, Gujarat, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. Highlighting the Buddhist heritage of Odisha, Pradhan wrote that during the Bhaumakara dynasty rule from the 8th to 10th century AD, Buddhism was considered as a state religion here. It is believed that the first disciples of Lord Buddha, Tapasu and Bhallika, hailed from the modern-day city of Jajpur. Though Buddhism entered Odisha long before the Kalinga War, it spread under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/pradhan-bats-for-odishas-inclusion-in-buddhist-circuit/articleshow/87091695.cms||Minati Singha

The HC has also ruled that the man will not be entitled to any pre-mature relief of release or any parole for the next 20 years. “We are of the opinion that the death sentence has a unique aspect. It is irrevocable. In the cases based on circumstantial evidence, the death sentence should be awarded only in case the prosecution has established its case by the evidence of such sterling quality that the court is absolutely clear about his guilt. It should be for a higher standard than the normal beyond reasonable doubt principle, as applied to criminal cases,” the two-judge bench of Justice S K Mishra and Justice Savitri Ratho said. “Hence, we are of the opinion that this is not a fit case to award the death sentence,” the bench further observed. It passed the order recently on a death reference seeking confirmation of the death sentence and another jail criminal appeal from the convict, Sunil Nayak, challenging the capital punishment. The additional sessions judge-cum-special judge, Keonjhar, had sentenced Sunil to death on December 19, 2019.

Last week, I bought petrol for Rs 103 per litre, and today, it is Rs 106.77 a litre. For daily commuting, I need around one litre petrol. My monthly expenses on petrol has increased thrice over the past year, but my salary has been reduced to half owing to the pandemic,” said Sudarshan Biswal, a marketing executive in a real-estate company. While the Centre has cited crude oil’s price rise in the global market as the reason for the hike in petroleum products in India, the state is yet to take a step to lower the VAT on such products. “Levying an absolute VAT instead of a percentage VAT on the base price can keep the fuel prices relatively lower, even if the base price of crude oil goes up. Any hike in the VAT imposed by the state governments is passed on to consumers, and the tax comprises around 70% of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel,” said Prasant Kanungo, a manager at a city fuel centre. The Odisha government levies 32% and 28% VAT on petrol and diesel, respectively. The traders’ body in the state had urged the state to reduce the VAT on fuel, but the appeal has went in vain. In October alone, petrol and diesel prices increased by Rs 4.15 and Rs 4.70 per litre respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/middle-class-weighed-down-by-sky-high-fuel-prices/articleshow/87091269.cms||Minati Singha

Drones (without battery) will mostly need to be in check-in bags and batteries (of upto certain wattage) only in cabin bags. For international trips, rules of destination countries will apply. A senior aviation ministry official said passengers should inform airlines when they are going to travel with a drone. “While there are no major restrictions for carrying drones either as checked-in or carry on baggage, major airlines as a matter of extraordinary precaution allow drones in check-in baggage. It is because of individual airline policy and not a regulatory requirement. However, when drones are accepted as check-in baggage, batteries need to removed and carried in carry-on baggage only,” said a senior aviation ministry official. “For spare batteries, there are no restrictions if they are of less than 100 Watt-hour (Wh). Maximum of two batteries if the Wh is more than 100 but less than 160 Wh with the approval of airlines. No spare batteries are allowed if Wh is more than 160,” the official added. The clarification on drone carriage comes at a time when airlines now routinely get queries from passengers about the same. An IndiGo spokesperson said: “As per the conditions of carriage drones can be carried in check-in luggage. However, batteries are not allowed in check-in. Passengers are asked to carry batteries in hand luggage. The limit is upto 160 Wh for lithium battery.” While the senior ministry official said it is advisable to carry nano drones — the most common ones for personal use weighing upto 250 grams — in cabin bags, most big airlines don’t allow the same. Nano drones have lithium-ion batteries. Due to potential fire risk, batteries are not allowed in check-in bags. Also security will detect lithium during inline screening and will offload the bag. A risk assessment was done for carriage of big drones. Accordingly it was decided that drones with batteries of over 160 Wh must be carried as cargo. However still the risk is that in passenger baggage due to handling and movement, lithium can catch fire. Hence most airlines allow the same to travel in cabin baggage as crew are trained to handle any incident of fire or smoke in cabin due to lithium. So ideally, the government official said, small drones with battery attached be carried in cabin bags; bigger drones in cabin bags and their lithium batteries also in cabin with proper insulation and large drones with batteries over 160 Wh in cargo with proper smoke detection and fire suppression in place. India has classified drones into five categories based on their weight: Nano upto 250 grams; micro between 250 gram and 2 kg; small between 2 and 25 kg; medium between 25 and 150 kg and large weighing over 150 kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/envy-inducing-pics-ahoy-drones-in-check-in-bags-batteries-upto-160-wh-in-hand-bags-allowed-now/articleshow/87092114.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: JDA set to transform parks into mini forests by using Miyawaki technique||JAIPUR: Mini forests will be springing up in different corners of the city as JDA has started plantation using popular Japanese Miyawaki technique. UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal inaugurated the project from Jawahar Circle to create urban forests. JDA has earmarked 30,000 sqm land in 10 city parks including Central Park and Ramniwas Bagh where it plans to plant approximately 1,20,000 shrubs and plants. The officials claimed that in comparison to conventional methods, the forests using this technique grow faster and become denser and more bio-diverse. A senior official said, "As the city population is growing, we have adopted this method to increase the green cover. It has been experienced and tested that these urban forests help lower temperatures in concrete heat islands, reduce air and noise pollution". The technique compresses layers of a forest – shrubs, trees, canopies – on small plots of land, turning them into tiny forests. "Around 20,000 plants will be planted in Hira Lal Park, Shastri Nagar. Using this technique, forests grow in two to three years and are self-sustaining. The civic body will be planting diverse native species," the official added. Meanwhile, JDA will also de-concretise the base of trees in the city and ensure that at least one metre area around them is left unpaved while laying tiles on footpaths or road construction. In a recent survey, JDA had found that the base of over 3,000 trees was concretised alongside arterial roads and local streets. An official said, "JDA will leave kuccha space measuring 1.5x1.5 around trees and install a grating. This would give longevity to the tress". The aim is to maintain the green cover. Sources said, "The city had less than 10% of its area under green cover, which is way less than the mandatory 20% required as per Master Plan 2025.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-set-to-transform-parks-into-mini-forests-by-using-miyawaki-technique/articleshow/87092049.cms||---

A small stool was found on top of a plastic chair near the railing. The twins had repeatedly said they wanted to see the moon, their mother said. The accident is believed to have taken place at 1am Sunday. Police said Satya Narayan and Surya Narayan Mudalia had gone to the balcony of their flat in Prateek Gardenia Carnesia after dinner. At 11.30pm Saturday, their mother, Radha, saw them playing with phones given to them for online classes and asked them to come with her to the other room and sleep. Two loud thuds as Gzb twins fell to their deathThe twins obliged. But no sooner had Radha dozed off, Satya and Surya sneaked out of the room and went to the balcony again, the family told the police. Around 1am, Radha woke up and found the twins missing. She went to their study room and found the balcony door open. She peered over the railing and saw a crowd on the road below. Radha rushed downstairs and saw Surya and Satya lying just metres apart, blood oozing out of their heads. They were rushed to a nearby hospital, but were declared dead on arrival. The brothers stayed with their mother and elder sister Gayatri. Their father, Palani Mudalia, is a senior executive in a private financial firm and had been working out of Mumbai for the past couple of weeks. The family, originally from Chennai, had shifted to Ghaziabad two years ago. Radha told TOI that her husband had called her around 11pm and asked about the children. “We finished our dinner around 9.30pm. They rushed to the study room (which has a balcony) and my daughter and I were watching TV. Around 11.30pm, I went to the balcony and they said they wanted to see the moon. But I brought them with me to sleep,” she said. “Around an hour later, I woke up and saw that they were not in the bed. I rushed to the balcony. They were not there either. I looked down and saw a crowd,” she added. A guard who was on duty at night said he heard two loud thuds, 15-20 seconds apart. “There were two boys lying face down. There was blood all around. I informed my supervisor,” he added. Mahipal Singh, circle officer 1 of Ghaziabad, said, “We found a plastic chair with a stool on top of it near the railing. There is a possibility that the two boys had peered over the railing and tried to see the moon. Their mother told us they had wanted to see it. They had brought the stool from the kitchen.” Police are also trying to find out if the two had attempted to enact something they had seen on the phone. “They had taken two phones along, saying they were going to study. We are examining the devices, but we haven’t found anything in the history. We will send the phones to a technical team,” Singh said.

After four rounds of online counseling, 89,187 seats (59%) have been filled, which is 13% more compared to the previous year. The number of vacant seats also came down by more than 21,000 to 62,683. Of 440 colleges, only ten government institutions were able to fill 100% of their intake. They include College of Engineering, Guindy, and Madras Institute of Technology. And 113 colleges filled more than 80% seats compared to 59 last year while 223 colleges filled more than 50% seats compared to 139 the previous year. Six colleges could not attract a single student this year, 92 colleges could fill less than 20% seats and 56 colleges could fill less than 10%. The Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) committee conducted the general online counselling from September 27 to October 17 in four rounds. “With supplementary counselling yet to be conducted, we expect a few hundred more seats to be filled. Despite several challenges including many students getting identical scores, the online counselling process went off smoothly this year,” TNEA secretary T Purushothaman said. Under the 7.5% quota for government school students, 7,324 seats were filled and 473 seats were filled under special categories such as differently-abled. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said the number of vacant seats may come down to 55,000 after supplementary counselling. Computer science engineering, electronics and communication engineering and information technology are the most preferred by students. “Mechanical and civil were the least preferred courses. More than 100 colleges have only single digit admissions in mechanical engineering this year,” Gandhi added. R M Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College, said, “More campus hiring by IT companies during the pandemic was one of the major reasons for the positive trend. Students gave more importance to colleges than courses in the last three rounds, which resulted in an overall increase in the number of colleges that filled more than 80% seats this year.” E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor of Anna University, said tier-2 colleges with 50% admissions would be able to survive.“However, colleges with less than 20% admissions cannot provide good infrastructure, faculty members. Around 100 colleges have been continuing to admit students with poor infrastructure and faculty members in the past five years,” he said. He asked the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Anna University and college managements to come up with alternative plans to save the future of the students who have joined these colleges. “The state government should close these colleges and transfer students to other colleges,” Balagurusamy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/engg-colleges-record-13-more-admissions-this-year/articleshow/87093587.cms||A Ragu Raman

On March 31, the state had 15,879 active cases. After that, the infection spread at a faster rate and reached its peak on May 28, when 3.12 lakh patients were undergoing treatment in hospitals and homes. The state government was struggling to find adequate ICU and oxygen-supported beds back then. Less than five percent of the 56,600 such beds in Covid hospitals were available. Five months down the line, the state has managed to not only create adequate infra but also reduce the infection figures. At present, there are 14,814 active cases in Tamil Nadu still the third highest in the country next to Kerala (87,657) and Maharashtra (28,631). Another worrying fact is that throughout the declining phase, TN's case-fatality ratio has remained above one percent. This meant that for every 100 confirmed cases, at least one unfortunately passed away from the virus. The state has so far witnessed 35,899 Covid deaths. This included 15 people, who died in the last 24 hours. All of them had comorbidities. But on the positive side, the number of new Covid-19 cases has continued to drop in Tamil Nadu. On Sunday, as many as 1,218 got infected. Chennai with a Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of 0.8 % once again topped the state's infection chart with 156 new cases. Coimbatore with 139 fresh cases has a slightly higher TPR of 1.3%. TN's overall TPR remained unchanged at 0.9 % for the past one week. J Radhakrishnan, state health secretary, said that even when the infection spread has reduced, people should be careful during the festive season. "Of late, many are getting infected after returning from other states and participating in family functions," he said. After five successful mass vaccination camps on Sundays, Tamil Nadu did not organise the sixth such camp this weekend because of the festive season. In the forthcoming mass camp, TN will prioritise people, who are due for their second dose, said Ma Subramanian, health minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/156-new-cases-of-covid-in-chennai-1218-across-state/articleshow/87101783.cms||---

Confirming the suspension of SHO (Ratanada) and three constables, police commissioner Jose Mohan said that the decision has been taken to keep them under suspension until the investigation of the case was done. “The main demands of the protesters included suspension of all the four policemen and filing of case against them under Section 302 of IPC has been accepted. The case would be investigated by the CID-CB,” said the officer. After the acceptance of the demand, the protestors comprising members of family and Valmiki community agreed to withdraw the 4-day-long demonstration and allow post-mortem. It may be noted that Kandara (32) had been killed during cross firing with the police on Wednesday in a long chase. He sustained bullet injures in his stomach and ribs and succumbed during transit to hospital. Police have also arrested three of his accomplices. Mohan said that he was a history sheeter of Nagauri gate police station who had about a dozen cases pertaining to extortion, attempt to murder, Arms Act, etc., and was wanted recently in a case related to deadly attack on a person with his brother Montu Kandara. The family and community members had sat on dharna at the MDM morgue on the same evening and refused to accept the body and allow the post-mortem until a case of murder was filed against the four policemen and suspension of all of them. The spot had turned into a political battle ground as RLP leader and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal extended support to the protestors.

Simultaneous raids were also conducted on the houses of his relatives and associates at 15 locations, including Bhubaneswar and Berhampur. The state crime branch had on December 3 last year arrested Panigrahi for allegedly duping several youths on the pretext of giving them employment in Tata Motors. Former Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Abhay Kant Pathak’s son, Akash, is a co-accused in the job scam. While the ruling BJD has already expelled Panigrahi from the party for his corrupt practices, the vigilance had registered a case against Panigrahi on October 4 following a directive by the Lokayukta Odisha. The vigilance conducted a secret verification against Panigrahi and found that he owned disproportionate assets to the tune of nearly Rs 5.05 crore between 24.5.2009 and 30.11.2020. “During the raids we seized several incriminating documents relating to purchase of land, vehicles, jewellery and other articles, like bank passbooks, credit/debit cards, laptops and mobiles. Around Rs 20 lakh cash was also seized from some associates of the MLA,” a senior vigilance official said. No arrest has been made so far in the case. Panigrahy, who was present at his home in Bhubaneswar during the raid, refused to speak to the media. The vigilance had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta, which in December last year directed it to start a preliminary inquiry against Panigrahi. The MLA had moved the high court, challenging the legality of the Lokayuktas order following which the HC quashed the Lokayuktas order on February 3 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/raids-on-gopalpur-mla-premises-in-da-case/articleshow/87093912.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Some of the collegium’s recommendations have been repeated twice since 2018 and have been pending with the government because of “adverse” reports — some reportedly lack eligibility criteria — against them. The highest number of four recommendations are for the Calcutta HC, followed by three for J&K and two for Karnataka. While the government is bound by procedure to accept the collegium’s recommendations if they are reiterated even after the Centre raises its objections, the law ministry can seek “clarifications” from the apex court. The oldest pending case is of advocate Wasim Sadiq Nargal who was first recommended by the J&K HC collegium to be made a judge of the HC in August 2017. The collegium, after evaluating a report submitted by the Centre and Intelligence Bureau, found him fit to be made a judge of the J&K HC and recommended his name in April, 2018. The government sent back Nargal’s recommendation to the collegium for reconsideration. But the apex court reiterated his name in February 2020, according to sources. For the third time, the government sent back his name, but the collegium in March 2021 reiterated its recommendation for his immediate appointment. The case is now pending with the Union law ministry. According to procedure, the Centre can send back a recommendation to the SC collegium for reconsideration only once. After the collegium reiterates a recommendation, despite objections registered by the Centre, it is mandatory for the government to appoint the candidate as judge. However, there have been several instances in the last few years where the government has sent back recommendations to SC collegium for reconsiderations, and in several cases this has also led to rejection of some recommendations. On an average, 50% cases recommended by various HC collegium have been rejected by the SC collegium over the past few years based on adverse findings during confidential background checks and reports submitted by the law ministry. Recently the government has cleared more than a 100 pending files, notifying appointments and transfers of HC judges and chief justices as recommended by the SC collegium. Law minister Kiren Rijiju has instructed his officials to clear all pending recommendations of the collegium which resulted in the ministry notifying at least 80-90 appointments of HC judges in the past two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-collegium-bats-for-12-despite-govt-objection/articleshow/87092757.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Mishra, who is himself an accused in an FIR registered by farmers, added, “Farmers were allowed to take over a road and then the route was not barricaded by police. Shyam Sundar Nishad, one of the workers, was alive with police and had reached an ambulance but was dragged out and killed. The guilty cops will not be spared and the government will conduct a probe against them. The government has given a free hand to the investigating agency”. The Thar jeep (the first vehicle in the killer convoy) was registered in the minister's name. His son Ashish, a key accused, is already under arrest and is being interrogated. In all, six men have been arrested till now in the case. Shyam Sundar’s brother Sanjeev Nishad, meanwhile, said, "I am happy that the minister has raised the issue of my brother’s death in police custody. I am sure the accused will be held soon and action will be taken against the policemen." When asked about the minister's claims, Lakhimpur Kheri SP Vijay Dhull said, "I am not aware if any such allegation was levelled. The investigation of this case is with SIT and I can’t comment on it." A senior cop, who was deployed for the security arrangements on the day of the clashes, said, "We had barricaded the road from both sides and provided protesters a different route. But the convoy passed through the barricades at a very high speed. Policemen signalled them to slow down. A normal person doesn't drive so fast in a busy market. There were many farmers on the road. Barricades are normally set up for vehicles to slow down, but (in this case) the convoy didn’t pay heed." TOI tried to contact Ajay Mishra for his comments, but he didn’t respond to calls. Incidentally, soon after the violence, protesting farmers had claimed that Shyam Sundar was beaten up and handed over to police "alive". They had also released photos to support the claim. A farmer, who was at the protest that day, had told TOI, "He was not critical. We have a photo in which he is walking with the police after we handed him over." This came even as three co-accused in the matter were sent back to jail on Sunday. They are now under judicial custody following the three-day police remand. The accused, including Ashish, have been kept in separate barracks, jailer Pankaj Singh said. In another development, in a video message released by police on Sunday, Amandeep Singh Sandhu, Lakhimpur Kheri district president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait), said that Samyukta Kisan Morcha's 'Rail roko' protest scheduled on October 18 has been called off in Kheri district after a meeting of the senior members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mishra-blames-uttar-pradesh-cops-for-bjp-mans-snatching-killing/articleshow/87094682.cms||---
---||India||BJP backs SP man to pip SP for deputy speaker||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said BJP was “following parliamentary traditions” by supporting SP MLA Nitin Agarwal for the post of deputy speaker of the UP assembly. Yogi made the statement while accompanying Agarwal when the SP MLA went up to file his nomination papers in the assembly. BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh and cabinet ministers, Brijesh Pathak and Suresh Khanna, were also present on the occasion. Nitin is the son of SP turncoat and former RS member Naresh Agarwal who switched over to the saffron camp in March 2018 after SP did not nominate him again to the Rajya Sabha and chose cine-star-turned politician Jaya Bachchan over him. While Nitin technically happens to be with SP, he has been openly hobnobbing with BJP without being expelled from SP. On Sunday, Narendra Verma, another SP MLA, also filed his papers for the deputy speaker’s post, triggereing an “SP versus SP” electoral contest due on Monday. Yogi maintained that SP, which is the principal opposition party in the state assembly, was not able to announce its candidate on time, which is why BJP decided to support the candidature of Nitin. Given the strength of BJP in the UP assembly — 304 seats — Nitin will have a cake walk over Verma. The contest also marks BJP’s attempt to consolidate the trader community ahead of the crucial UP polls due in the next few months. SP has fielded Verma, a Kurmi, in what is seen as a deft move to whip up the OBC card to counter BJP. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in UP assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary accused BJP of not following the parliamentary traditions in the election of deputy speaker and causing obstruction in the election of SP candidate Narendra Verma who comes from OBC category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-backs-sp-man-to-pip-sp-for-deputy-speaker/articleshow/87094974.cms||---

More than 4 crore unorganised workers have been registered at e-Shram Portal, India’s first national database on unorganised workers to make government facilities easily available for them. Union minister for labour and employment Bhupender Yadav said by registering themselves, the unorganised workers will be able to get the benefits of government schemes easily. The exercise is the first of its kind to recognise a huge number of unorganised sector workers who are engaged in diverse sectors like construction, transport, agriculture, apparel manufacturing, fishing, gig and platform work, street vending, agriculture and allied as well as domestic workers. Odisha (88.35 lakh), West Bengal (80.35 lakh), Uttar Pradesh (67.02 lakh), Bihar (62.44 lakh) and Madhya Pradesh (15.79 lakh) have been able to record the highest number of registrations. But Assam, despite its comparatively smaller population, has scripted success at eighth position by documenting 9.95 lakh (9,95,707) workers.  Rajasthan and Punjab are at sixth and seventh positions with 14.18 lakh and 10.33 lakh registrations. Assam is followed by Maharashtra (9.37 lakh) and Chattisgarh (8.24 lakh). “After registration at e-SHRAM Portal, the unorganised workers shall receive a digital e-SHRAM cards and they can update their profiles/particulars through portal or mobile app. They will have a Universal Account Number (on eSHRAM card) that will be acceptable across the country and will not be required to register at different places for obtaining social security benefits,” read the PIB release. It added that if a worker is registered at the e-Shram portal and meets with an accident, he or she will be eligible for Rs 2 lakh in case of death or permanent disability and Rs 1 lakh in case of partial disability. Principal secretary to the labour welfare department, Assam, JB Ekka, said the target is to register all unorganised workers of the state within December. “Agriculture workers also come under the unorganised sector, which may take their numbers to around 80 lakh in Assam,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-eighth-in-unorganised-sector-registration-on-portal/articleshow/87091389.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Ravichandran, 47, of Presily Nagar, Otteri, had a daughter named Dikshitha. He and his wife were not on good terms after he lost his job a year ago. From then on, the family faced huge financial crunch which led to frequent fights. During one such fight, Ravichandran’s wife left him and her daughter, and started living with her mother. Despite pleading with his wife, she refused to patch up with him. Frustrated over this, the man decided to end his life. He told his daughter on Saturday that he will take her to Mamallapuram where she can play on the beach and also take a look at the monuments. Excited about this, she accompanied him on the trip. On Saturday, they booked a room at a hotel. He ordered food in the afternoon, in which he is believed to have mixed poison and fed her. Since the room was found locked for a long time, the manager tried calling them from the landline. As there was no response, they informed the Mamallapuram police, who found Ravichandran hanging. He had pasted a suicide note on the TV stating that no one was responsible for their death and had taken the decision out of frustration. He had also sent a WhatsApp message to his relative disclosing his extreme step. Before he could alert the police, the duo had died, police said. Police have registered a case and are investigating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-poisons-8-yr-old-daughter-ends-life/articleshow/87091428.cms||---

It also said that Priyanka was the most popular face in UP and that Congress was in a direct contest with BJP, while Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have fallen behind in the race, according to a PTI report. Senior leader P L Punia, who is heading the Congress’s UP campaign committee, said, “Our campaign will revolve around Priyanka... she has fought for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri, and earlier in Sonbhadra, Unnao, Hathras.” The articulation underlines a reality given that besides being the AICC general secretary in charge of state, she has been campaigning in the Gandhi family’s pocketboroughs for years and then in the rest of state after the UPA was ousted from power. While her projection was bound to be automatic, Punia’s upfront remark only buttresses the fact that Priyanka will carry the responsibility for the party’s performance in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priyanka-to-be-partys-face-in-uttar-pradesh-polls-congress/articleshow/87095033.cms||---

Sources said the BSF has been put on high alert to foil intrusion bids from across the country or any communal instigation in the villages on the Indian side. However, the administration has issued an order to complete immersion of Durga idols on Sunday and taken extra security precautions for peaceful immersion processions.  “We have been in touch with the local leaders of Hindu organisations and affiliated bodies with a request not to make any abrupt reactions over the attacks on Hindu temples during Durga Puja in Bangladesh. Necessary arrangements have been made to secure the people of all communities in Tripura and protect their sentiments,” said a top official of the state home department. He said the matter is in the exclusive domain of India’s external affairs ministry and it has been closely monitoring each and every development in Bangladesh. The sources indicated that the security of Assistant High Commission of Bangladesh here has also been enhanced besides that of mosques and religious institutions of minority communities in Tripura. Till now, there has been no report of any untoward incident. Meanwhile, the police arrested at least seven Bangladeshi nationals from a construction site in the Siddhi Ashram area of Agartala on Saturday who had been working as masons there for the past few days after illegally crossing over to Tripura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tripura-steps-up-security-after-communal-flare-up-in-bdesh/articleshow/87088323.cms||---

On the eve of foreign minister S Jaishankar’s visit to Tel Aviv, Israel’s foreign secretary Alon Ushpiz told TOI in an exclusive chat, “We want very much to look into, how can the new situation in the Middle East have an Indian angle to it? How can we incorporate India into the opportunities that are emerging? Normally this region is flooded with threats and challenges. But in the last year, I have seen the dramatically changed landscape in the Middle East because of the Abraham Accords. This is really a strategic earthquake.” Jaishankar’s visit will be India’s first high-level engagement with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s government, therefore closely watched in Israel. India, particularly Narendra Modi, enjoyed an unprecedented relationship with former PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. The signals from this visit will, therefore, be a pointer to the future of one of India’s closest international relationships. Therefore, Jaishankar’s discussions with his counterpart Yair Lapid discussions will be significant. Read AlsoFirst in-person Quad talks: What leaders said in opening remarksNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with his counterparts Australian PM Scott Morrison and Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga on Friday attended the first in-person meeting of Quad leaders hosted by US President Joe Biden. During the meeting, the leaders plan to discuss a range of issues likeInterestingly, Ushpiz said, while no one in the Quad had approached Israel, they would like to engage with “anyone” on the bloc’s focus areas of vaccines, emerging technology, climate change and security. “We will be happy to join any conversation in these areas. I will be very happy to deepen our cooperation with India on all these issues. But... no one from the Quad has knocked on our doors.” he said. The next frontiers of the bilateral relationship, Ushpiz said, lies in Big Data, technology, healthcare and communications. “There are new frontiers when it comes to technology that we don’t have the luxury of missing. Artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, Big Data — all these things that can be part of our security cooperation and economic prosperity, but also provide security and stability to our people,” Ushpiz said. “We have to be very strict, keep our eyes on the ball when it comes to new fields of technology. There is no doubt in my mind that technology can easily decide the economic fate of nations,” he added.

Ushpiz said Iran is “very determined to have nuclear capabilities, which I believe they have not deserted, which I believe they want to take as quickly as possible forward, which we believe they are breaching every promise that they’ve made and every paper that they’ve signed. Unfortunately, in their minds, in the minds of the Iranians, they do not see the robust and stern reaction from the International community.” India, on the other hand, is doubling down on Iran, particularly in the context of the fresh security challenges emerging from the Afghanistan situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-us-israel-uae-coming-together-to-form-a-2nd-quad/articleshow/87095072.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The SC bench said the HC passed the directions without deciding the objection of the government department that the RTI Act was not applicable to it. “It is the specific case on behalf of the department that the RTI Act was not applicable to the organisation/department. Despite the above and without deciding such an objection, the HC has directed the appellant to furnish the documents sought without deciding the applicability of the RTI Act. That will be putting the cart before the horse,” the bench said. The apex court said the high court ought to have decided the issue with respect to the applicability of the RTI Act to the organisation or department first. “We direct the HC to first decide the issue with respect to the applicability of the RTI Act to the appellant organisation/department and thereafter decide the stay application/LPA. The aforesaid exercise shall be completed within eight weeks,” the bench said. The SC was hearing an appeal filed by the Centre against the 2018 decision of the HC, which directed the department to provide information to the employee within 15 days. The counsel appearing on behalf of the Centre had told the HC that the department from which information was sought is exempted as per Section 24(1) of the RTI Act. Therefore, the CIC order is contradictory to Section 24 of the RTI Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/decide-if-intel-security-groups-exempt-under-rti-sc-tells-hc/articleshow/87095225.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: V K Sasikala steps up efforts to regain control AIADMK||CHENNAI: On a day, when the AIADMK officially launched its year-long golden jubilee celebrations to mark the completion of 50 years of the party, expelled leader V K Sasikala stepped up efforts to get back into the party by calling upon all the factions to unite as one. Her message was loud and clear. She was here to stay and her plan -- to take control of an united AIADMK.  “Even when I faced a crisis on the personal front, I ensured that the AIADMK government stayed on course and was in the seat of power. I stepped away from the election scene in order not to hurt the prospects of the AIADMK,” Sasikala said, while addressing a gathering of her supporters at AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran’s residence at Ramapuram in Chennai. At every step, Sasikala sought to gain sympathy by projecting herself as the one who had been wronged and betrayed.  “All of us have the responsibility to safeguard this party for decades to come. We have to unite for AIADMK to emerge the winner,” Sasikala said, launching her version of AIADMK’s golden jubilee celebrations. Sasikala urged her supporters not to attack or abuse anyone on the other side of AIADMK. “We cannot commit the same mistake as them,” she cautioned.  Recalling an yesteryear MGR hit song ‘Kann pona pokkile, Kaal pogalama..’, from the film ‘Panam Padaithavan’, Sasikala wondered how some people (leaders in AIADMK) had forgotten the path they tread. ‘Naam Ondraaga Vendum; Kazhagam Vendraaga Vendum’ (We have to unite, the party has to win) was the slogan that Sasikala put forth, while concluding her speech.  Earlier, she hoisted the party flag and unveiled a commemorative plaque at MGR memorial on Arcot Road in T Nagar. Over the next couple of days, the schedule for Sasikala’s state-wide tour, to reach out to the AIADMK cadres, is likely to be released. On Sunday, when Sasikala’s supporters presented her with a ‘golden sword’ and also gave her a new moniker ‘Puratchi Thai (revolutionary mother)’, (and also referred to as ‘Thyagathalaivi Chinnamma), a few leaders from AMMK, a party launched by her nephew T T V Dhinakaran, were present. But AMMK general secretary Dhinakaran himself was not in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sasikala-steps-up-efforts-to-regain-control-of-party/articleshow/87091921.cms||D Govardan

According to sources, Karra was lauding the role of the Nehru-Gandhi family in strengthening the nation even as he urged Rahul Gandhi to take the leadership of the party. In an attempt to emphasise the point, he said while Sardar Patel is credited for the unification of India, the credit should go to Nehru in case of Jammu and Kashmir, as he sought to allude to historical facts. After partition, Jammu and Kashmir was annexed by India following an attack by the Pakistan army masked as tribals. The contrast appeared to create an awkward moment in the CWC meeting as it was apparently not liked by others. Three senior leaders interjected to ask him to stick to the subject at hand and not digress. One leader even remarked that Patel was more than Kashmir and there were events like police action in Hyderabad. Karra went on to say that the Gandhi family had to assume the leadership of the party, and the country depended on it. In an interesting turn, Karra also rounded off the meeting by jumping in and demanding that the gathering raise hands if it agreed that Rahul should immediately take over as party president. The demand invited murmurs from the gathering with some even dubbing it as embarrassing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-netas-patel-stand-at-cwc-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/87095289.cms||---

Sidhu said the Punjab government must deliver on the priority areas that he had listed and sought time from Sonia to present a ‘Punjab Model’ which would be part of the Congress manifesto for 2022 assembly polls. The letter was written after Sidhu held a meeting with Rahul Gandhi and other leaders in Delhi on the ongoing Congress crisis in Punjab. Interestingly, he had told mediapersons after his meetings that “all issues have been resolved”. Sidhu warned that “mafia-raj ruling the state patronised by the Badals will take the state to the extent of financial emergency, joblessness, corruption and agrarian crisis from where there will be no return”. Requesting Sonia to consider the points highlighted by him, Sidhu urged the party president to direct the state government to act in the best interest of the people of Punjab immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhu-seeks-sonias-time-to-discuss-punjabs-last-chance/articleshow/87095354.cms||---

However, IMD sources ruled out any immediate possibility of a low pressure resulting in cyclones that may affect the northeast region. The IMD on Sunday released a bulletin of increase in rainfall activity over the northeastern states from October 18 to 21. The current meteorological conditions indicated that moisture incursion is very likely to occur due to strong lower-level southerly/southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal to northeast India during this period. Under its influence, the Met office said fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are likely to occur over the northeast region from October 18. The change in weather is set to bring relief as several parts of the northeast, especially Assam, was reeling under sweltering heat during Durga Puja. “Maximum day temperature is likely to drop over the northeastern states from tomorrow (Monday) due to the expected rainfall activity,” read the special weather bulletin from Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD based in Guwahati. In Guwahati, the maximum temperature inched up to 37.7 degrees Celsius on Navami and Vijaya Dashami. These two days were the hottest ever recorded in the city during October. Even as rain is likely to lash all seven northeastern states, Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh may experience most of the rainfall activities on Tuesday. Light to moderate rainfall at most places with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall has been predicted for the three states on Tuesday. A yellow warning has also been issued for the northeast states till October 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/heavy-rainfall-alert-after-record-heat-in-the-northeast-states/articleshow/87089500.cms||Kangkan Kalita

He said UPPL candidate Jalen Daimary will get at least 80% votes in the polls. The seat fell vacant after the UPPL MLA from the constituency, Lehoram Boro, died of Covid-19 in May. The CM said peace has permanently come to the region after the tripartite Bodo Accord was signed last year. “Due to constant effort, the atmosphere of fear, which was there at least 10 years ago, changed after Narendra Modi became the prime minister in 2014,” he added. He believed people will vote for UPPL in the interest of peace, unity, brotherhood and development in the region. He thanked Chandi Basumatary, Deben Boro and Emmanuel Mushahary for withdrawing their nominations to extend support to UPPL on Saturday. They had filed their nominations as Independent candidates. Meanwhile, the CM announced that a bridge will be constucted over Pagladia river at Kharanie in Tamulpur at a cost of Rs 600 crore to enhance better communication. He also took stock of the bridge that is being constructed over Pagladia river at Jartaluk. Slamming the Congress, the CM said the Congress is playing football without a goalkeeper. “Development is possible only under the rule of BJP and its allies,” he added. It may be mentioned that Tamulpur was the only seat among the all five constituencies where the BJP-led alliance won in the assembly elections held in March-April. Among the other four seats, Congress had won Mariani and Thowra, while All India United Democratic Front had won Bhabanipur and Bodoland Peoples’ Front had won Gossaigaon seat. The sitting MLAs of Mariani, Thowra and Bhabanipur later quit their parties, and joined BJP, while the Gossaigaon MLA died of Covid-19. The CM added that BJP and its allies will give a spectacular performance in all the five constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/sarma-campaigns-for-uppl-tamulpur-bypoll-candidate/articleshow/87089492.cms||Mukut Das

The change in weather is set to bring relief as several parts of the northeast, especially Assam, was reeling under sweltering heat during Durga Puja. “Maximum day temperature is likely to drop over the northeastern states from tomorrow (Monday) due to the expected rainfall activity,” read the special weather bulletin from Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD based in Guwahati. In Guwahati, the maximum temperature inched up to 37.7 degrees Celsius on Navami and Vijaya Dashami. These two days were the hottest ever recorded in the city during October. Even as rain is likely to lash all seven northeastern states, Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh may experience most of the rainfall activities on Tuesday. Light to moderate rainfall at most places with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall has been predicted for the three states on Tuesday. A yellow warning has also been issued for the northeast states till October 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/heavy-rainfall-alert-after-record-heat-in-the-northeast-states/articleshow/87104189.cms||Kangkan Kalita

While the average prices of pulses and major edible oils have remained almost same as a month back, the prices of onion and tomatoes have gone up due to increased fuel prices and damage to summer crops. The government data, which compiles the prices reported from over 100 centres, show that the average price of onions as on Sunday increased to Rs 39 a kg compared to Rs 28 a month back. A year back the average price stood at Rs 46 per kg. In some of the urban centres such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the onion prices were in the range of Rs 50-65 per kg on Sunday. In the case of tomatoes, the average price on Sunday was Rs 45 a kg compared to Rs 27 a kg in September and Rs 41 per kg a year back. The data show, tomato was selling at Rs 93 a kg in Kolkata. Sources said the tomato prices may increase further because of recent rains in parts of the country.

---||India||Shaping robust framework for a water-sensitive policy||The Times Water Conclave, organised by the Times of India Group, brought policy-makers, community leaders, naturalists, technical experts and champions on a common platform to brainstorm on various facets of water conservation. The shared vision was to make UP a water positive state. The event held in Varanasi on October 6 was marked by the presentation of status reports, situation analysis, success stories and models for saving, reviving and rejuvenating water bodies in the state. The event, which was attended by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, cabinet minister for water resources and Jal Shakti Mahendra Singh, his deputy Dinesh Khatik and other dignitaries, concluded with a run through by VK Madhavan, head of Wateraid India – the knowledge partner for the initiative. The key takeaways from the event were as follows: Declare rivers, ponds & wetlands shared legacy During the event, experts said rivers and ponds are a shared legacy of the people who reside along it. The inhabitants need to be sensitised towards this and its importance on the overall quality of life. For instance, the importance of fresh air and oxygen pockets in polluted cities can be driven to make people understand the need of a park, pond or wetland in the neighbourhood. Ganga, the lifeline and fate line of India Stating that Ganga is the lifeline and fate line of northern India and an identity of Indians across the world, experts said collaborative steps are needed to save the divine river and its biodiversity. They said while governments at the Centre and in the state are implementing a well-planned strategy to check pollution in the river and its tributaries, any support from the community is most welcome. Political leadership a game-changer A committed political leadership can turn programmes into campaigns and change the approach with which the same government machinery deals with schemes. The movement towards achievement of targets is accelerated and the ripple effect on stakeholders and community is fuelled with minimal efforts. The conclusion that UP has done a lot for water conservation was unanimous. Water policy: The iron framework UP’s policy on water conservation and its optimal utilisation is in its final stages. Experts said the draft has been formulated through a consultative process which involved brainstorming and deliberations from domain experts in the presence of government functionaries. The policy is set to be promulgated and experts are looking forward to it. Champions uphold the message in community Water being an essential element of life cannot be claimed by a single entity, not even by the government. Its conservation must be a team effort with champions (seven of whom were felicitated during the conclave) advocating the cause wherever they can. Experts believed that champions are harbingers of the change that is targeted through official programmes. Community sustains models of change Presence of champions committed to the cause of water conservation can have a trickle-down effect in the community. Once people start reaping the benefits of the intervention, the community embraces it as a way of life which brings sustainability to the idea or model of change. System facilitates and recharges The active involvement of official and administrative framework is crucial to any programme but experience from the field has indicated that in case of causes like water conservation, the administrative machinery should play the role of a facilitator and a reinforcer. Community must lead while the system should follow instead of officers leading and community following. This ensures that the idea doesn’t fizzle out upon change of guards in the district or state. Groundwater-sensitive urban planning Considering the fact that Uttar Pradesh is witnessing one of the fastest rates of urbanisation in the country, there is a need to re-imagine cities. Instead of designing them to repel water out of the cities, the urban planners and developers must adopt a water-sensitive approach to design and planning. The basic building plan must include systems to limit exploitation of groundwater and guarantee its recharge through proper arrangements to store and conserve rainwater for future use and health of aquifers. It must include systems that allow recycle and reuse of grey water to check wastage/overuse of clean water and plan for its treatment before being released into the environment. Inter-departmental coordination The official framework may have challenges of different verticals of water conservation falling under different departments but the system must bring diverse stakeholders on a common plane for the larger cause. Incentives to aid transition Experts said while there are legislations that make measures for conservation of water mandatory, as in the case of groundwater, there is a need to incentivise it in a way that encourages people and groups to adopt it and embrace the public-interest way of seeing things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shaping-robust-framework-for-a-water-sensitive-policy/articleshow/87095425.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||India||Rains till October 21 due to low pressure systems, western disturbance: IMD||NEW DELHI: A western disturbance and formation of two lower pressure systems — one over Arabian Sea and the other over the Bay of Bengal — will continue to cause rainfall in different parts of the country till October 21, the India Meteorological Department said in its latest weather updates on Sunday. “There were two low pressure systems, one over the Bay of Bengal and another over Arabian Sea. There was some kind of interaction between these two low pressure systems,” said M Mohapatra, IMD director general, while referring to the reasons behind the current spell of rainfall. These interactions and heavy wind have primarily led to torrential rainfall in Kerala in the past 48 hours. It is now expected that these systems, mainly easterlies, may trigger onset of the northeast (winter) monsoon over the south Peninsula around October 26. The IMD, in its updates, said a western disturbance lying over Afghanistan and its neighbourhood was interacting with easterlies at lower levels from the Bay of Bengal. It is very likely to continue for the next two or three days and fairly widespread to widespread ‘light to moderate rainfall’ with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places is very likely over different parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, till Tuesday under its influence. “A fresh spell of easterly wave is likely to affect south Peninsular India from October 20 and cause fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls likely over Kerala and Mahe, south interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal,” the IMD said, while noting that the situation may continue for subsequent 3-4 days. Though intense spell of rainfall activity over south peninsular India (Kerala and Mahe, South Interior Karnataka and Tamilnadu, Puducherry and Karaikal) is likely to reduce, heavy rainfall activity is expected over east and northeast India during October 18-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rains-till-october-21-due-to-low-pressure-systems-western-disturbance-imd/articleshow/87095768.cms||---

He had been diagnosed with cancer and breathed his last at his residence in Jodhpur at about 6.30am. A two-time MLA, Maderna had spent 10 years in prison after his alleged involvement in the Bhanwari Devi case in 2011. He was diagnosed with stage IV malignancy in his oral cavity and had been undergoing treatment first in Mumbai and then Chennai. The Rajasthan High Court had first granted interim bail to him in September last year. Due to deteriorating health, he was given permanent bail in August this year. He is survived by his wife Leela Maderna, who was elected Jodhpur zila pramukh in September 2021, while his daughter Divya Maderna has been representing the Osian assembly segment in Jodhpur since 2018. CM Ashok Gehlot, PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra, MLA Tonk Sachin Pilot and West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankar offered their condolences on twitter. “His body has been taken to his parental village Chadi in Osian subdivision of Jodhpur and the funeral will be held in the evening”, said Ram Prakash, a family friend. Son of the Congress doyen, the late Parasram Maderna, he was sacked on October 16, 2011, few days after he was arrested for his alleged role in the abduction and murder of Devi. Having served as Jodhpur zila pramukh for 17 years, Maderna was seen as the only challenge to the hegemony of Ashok Gehlot. “His body was consigned to flames in his ancestral village Chadi in Osian subdivision in Jodhpur in the evening with the state honour. He had been suffering from stage IV malignancy in his oral cavity and had been undergoing treatment after admission in hospitals first at Mumbai and then Chennai,” said Ram Prakash, a family friend.  Forest and Environment minister Sukhram Bishnoi was present at the funeral representing the state government along with many political leaders, present and past MLAs, pradhans and sarpanches.

In a statement, the umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three agri laws, said “protests will only be intensified until justice is secured” in the Lakhimpur Kheri case. “To press for its demand for junior home minister Ajay Mishra’s dismissal and arrest, so that justice can be secured in the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre, Samyukt Kisan Morcha has announced a nationwide ‘rail roko’ programme on Monday. SKM put out a call to its constituents to stop rail traffic for six hours on October 18, between 10 am and 4 pm. The SKM asks for this action to be taken up peacefully, without any destruction and damage of any kind to any railway property,” it said. Four of the eight people who died in the violence on October 3 were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver. Farmers have claimed that Ashish Mishra, son of the Union minister, was in one of the vehicles. The SKM also claimed that at effigy-burning events across UP, many farmer leaders were put under house arrest while some were detained.

---||Business||Digit Insurance to use funds to grow market share||MUMBAI: Digit Insurance, which recently raised funds at a valuation of $3.5 billion, is seeing an opportunity to scale up business in the current fiscal as several insurers are facing capital constraints in the wake of adverse claim ratios. With capital at nearly thrice the statutory requirement, the company also has tech infrastructure to support growth. The private insurer, which is already ranked 15th among the 30 non-life companies (including health), has recorded a gross written premium of Rs 2,196 crore for the first half of FY22, which is 67% more than the same period of the previous fiscal. Currently, around 55% of its premium comes from motor insurance. “We should end the year with a market share of around 2%,” said Digit Insurance chairman Kamesh Goyal. This is despite the company, which is only in its fourth year of operations, not engaging in crop insurance that forms a significant volume business for the insurance industry. “Our solvency margin will be around 300% of the statutory requirement once the present funding round is over. This gives us a big opportunity to grow our business,” said Goyal. According to Goyal, the ability to raise capital puts Digit in an advantageous position. “Last year, many non-life insurers grew aggressively. This year, the first quarter has been tough and some insurers had to release their claims reserves. We have been a bit cautious and had a good combined ratio in Q1 this year,” he said. The non-life industry is capital-constrained with three state-owned companies in loss and several Indian promoters not in a position to infuse capital. According to Goyal, Digit will use its capital to provide capacity to Indian industry including thermal power where there are capacity constraints with reinsurers backing out due to green reasons. Besides the opportunities for capturing market share, the small-ticket policies that Digit had pioneered are looking up after the pandemic. “We are seeing a pickup in travel insurance following the normalisation of air travel guidelines by the government.” The company’s investment in technology is facilitating growth. “We are moving towards self-service in a big way. We have enabled customers to conduct the pre-acceptance inspection of the car by submitting photographs and they get an instant decision in some cases. The advantage of this is that the customer immediately knows if the photographs are of acceptable quality and also whether the vehicle is accepted for insurance,” said Goyal. Digit Insurance has also reduced dependency on its call centre by enabling service requests on WhatsApp using artificial intelligence. “Earlier, for one lakh policies, we were handling 1,800 calls a day. Now, with 10x the number of policies, the call volume is around 2,300. We have, however, received 72,000 service requests on WhatsApp,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digit-insurance-to-use-funds-to-grow-mkt-share/articleshow/87093966.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Elusive leopard approaches cage, but shies away from stepping||MUMBAI: A leopard wanted by the forest authorities for attacking humans at Aarey Colony has come close to cages set up for her, but refused to saunter in. Although still elusive, forest officials said they would get the spotted female cat soon. A source said that she had come in the vicinity of a cage on more than one occasion. “Difficult to say why, but maybe she finds something fishy about it...” said the source. Villagers from hamlets in Aarey too claimed to have spotted a leopard around the cage, said the source who did not wish to be identified. Their version may not be entirely reliable, as Aarey has a lot of leopards lurking around, the source said. A leopard on the prowl has attacked at least six people at Aarey Colony over the past three weeks. Mayur Kamath, honorary wildlife warden, pointed out that the untrained eye cannot conclusively identify a problem leopard. “But the wanted leopard would be caged within a couple of days,” he said. Kamath added that leopards have been around human settlements for a long time without attacking humans. “If this one has been attacking, it could be for various reasons which may be difficult to pinpoint,” he said, adding that humans on the lookout for leopards could be spurring it to attack. “People should not follow any sighted animal armed with torches and sticks. This calls for another possible attack. There are other safe ways like bursting crackers to scare away an animal,” said Kamath. Another source said the hitch is that leopards roam only at night and rules mandate that a wild animal cannot be darted with a tranquilliser after sundown and before sunset. Assistant conservator of forests Girija Desai told TOI that the leopard’s location has been tracked down. “The process to cage it has been strengthened,” she said. “We hope to get lucky soon.” A leopard on the prowl has attacked at least six people at Aarey Colony over the past month. During one such attack, a team of volunteers managed to take photos from which its identity has been established. The rosette pattern – the spots on a leopard’s hide ¬¬-- has a distinctive identity, unique to each leopard from which any two leopards can be discerned. Two leopards had walked into the trap set up around Aarey. While one was the sibling of the ‘wanted’ leopard, the other was its mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/elusive-leopard-approaches-cage-but-shies-away-from-stepping-in-mumbai/articleshow/87094995.cms||Alex Fernandes

Addressing a series of public meetings to garner support for the RJD candidate from Tarapur assembly constituency, Tejashwi said the common people were feeling the heat of rampant corruption and price rise. “Unemployment is a big issue. Yet no concrete step has been taken by the government to address it. The potential and ability of youths are not being used in nation building,” he lamented at one of the meetings at Asarganj block in Munger district. Recalling the death of sitting JD(U) MLA from Tarapur Mewalal Choudhary, which necessitated the bypoll, Tejashwi alleged that Choudhary fell victim to poor health facilities in the state. “Imagine the plight of common people when the state government couldn’t provide proper treatment to an MLA of the ruling party. The report of Niti Aayog has exposed the health care in Bihar,” Tejashwi added. In a veiled attack on CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD leader said how will he (Nitish) ask people to vote for his party nominee under such a situation. Earlier, in a tweet, he blamed Nitish Kumar government for poor health facilities in government hospitals. The meetings were held at Madarpur, Bishanpur, Kharba, Bhateri, Gorho, Amaiya, Sangrampur, Dulhar, Machhidih, Cherai, Chorgaon and Bari Magarappa among others in the district on the first day. The RJD leader exuded confidence that people would vote for RJD nominees from both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly constituencies. “It will be the victory of the people in both the constituencies,” he added. Sources in RJD said that Tejashwi will camp in Tarapur assembly constituency till October 19 and address corner meetings under Asarganj, Sangrampur, Tetiya Bambar and Tarapur blocks. RJD has fielded Arun Kumar from Tarapur. Tejashwi will later leave for Kusheshwar Asthan from where Ganesh Bharti is contesting from RJD. The RJD has deputed its legislators, former MLAs, and contestants of the previous state assembly election in panchayats to woo the electorate in favour of the party candidates. Earlier, RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha predicted the fall of the NDA government in the state. “The outcome of the bypoll will pave the way for the downfall of the NDA government in Bihar,” he claimed. RJD chief Lalu Prasad also assailed the NDA government for soaring prices of essential commodities and petroleum products. In a sarcastic attack, Lalu tweeted, “What’s relationship between ‘price rise’ and the NDA rule?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-slams-govt-over-poor-health-facilities/articleshow/87090109.cms||Ramashankar

The incident took place in the remote village on Saturday but came to light on Sunday. The deceased was identified as Savara Padma (35) and the accused is Savara Joga Rao, alias Jagga Rao.

---||Business||HDFC Bank’s recast loans rise to 1.7%, NPAs ease||MUMBAI: HDFC Bank has reported a significant increase in restructured loans under the Covid relief scheme. Analysts are concerned that a large chunk of these loans might turn into non-performing assets (NPAs). On the positive side, the bank has reported an improvement in gross NPA ratio by 12 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) quarter on quarter to 1.35%. Its subsidiary HDB Financial Services also reported a improvement in GNPA to 6.1% from 7.8% in the corresponding quarter last year. “However, the restructuring pool for the bank surged sharply quarter on quarter to Rs 20,300 crore (1.7% of loans vs. 0.68% in Q1), mainly led by liberal restructuring in the personal loan book. As a prudent strategy, the bank made additional Rs 1,200 crore provisions in Q2 and now carries a contingent plus floating buffer of Rs 9,200 crore (0.8% of loans),” said Anand Dama of Emkay Global in a research note. Addressing analysts on Saturday, HDFC Bank chief credit officer Jimmy Tata said, “Restructured loans are considered while making the provisions. If there were to be another shock, the balance sheet needs to be much more resilient, historically we have been conservative and our stance does not change”. He added that the bank was monitoring the restructured loan portfolio based on both pre- and post-Covid behaviour of the borrower. “We do not think the impact will be more than 10-20bps on our NPAs at any point in time,” he said. The country’s largest private lender on Saturday reported a net profit of Rs 8,834 crore for the quarter ended September 2021, up 18% from the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-banks-recast-loans-rise-to-1-7-npas-ease/articleshow/87093930.cms||---
---||Business||Saroj Poddar to create Zuari holding company for agriculture||MUMBAI: Saroj Poddar-controlled Adventz Group will implement a structure in which the publicly listed Zuari Agro Chemicals will become the holding company of the agriculture unit, which contributes 60% to the enterprise’s $3-billion revenue. The group’s planned structure resembles the way Tata Sons and Reliance Industries are organised, with a central unit handling corporate-wide activities such as finance, and independent business arms focused on specific segments. Poddar, the reticent businessman from Kolkata, gained Zuari Agro after his father-in-law K K Birla bequeathed the fertiliser business to him and his wife Jyotsna. He subsequently ramped up the business by acquiring Mangalore Chemicals from Vijay Mallya, the former chairman of United Breweries and United Spirits. As part of the overhaul, Zuari Agro is in the middle of transferring the farm retail and the Goa fertiliser businesses to two separate subsidiaries. The realignment will leave Zuari Agro with the residue fertiliser business (the single superphosphate or SSP plant in Maharashtra) and investments in multiple operating entities. “We will explore options including carving out the SSP business in the future,” said Zuari Agro non-executive director Suresh Krishnan. Zuari Agro, in which Poddar and family own 65%, has a market cap of over Rs 520 crore. “A holding company structure helps to have a higher controlling stake with lower beneficial shareholding in operating entities,” said InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian. Krishnan added that the restructuring also aids to attract investments in specific businesses as certain investors would not like to have a finger in every pie. Zuari Agro is in advanced stages to sell up to 30% in the farm retail business (Zuari FarmHub) to Morocco’s OCP. Adventz is, however, unfazed if Zuari Agro trades at a discount in the stock market after the change in status as traditionally the market value of holding companies like Pilani Investments (controlled by Kumar Mangalam Birla) are captured at a discount. “We fully realise that there will be a discount for the holding company but at the same time the kind of value that the individual parts can make on their own will offset,” Krishnan said. After the restructuring and the expansion of the fertiliser business, Zuari Agro will be close to the top private sector player Coromandel (part of Murugappa Group) in terms of capacity (over 3-million metric tonne). Besides agri, Poddar has interests in engineering & infrastructure, lifestyle and financial services. The septuagenarian is best known for introducing men’s shaving brand Gillette, French furniture maker Gautier and Duracell batteries to Indian consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/saroj-poddar-to-create-zuari-holding-co-for-agri/articleshow/87093997.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The proposal for the construction of a mini fishing harbour at Bheemili is one that has remained on paper for decades. The fisherfolk community in Bheemili have been struggling to sell their catch in the absence of a mini fishing harbour. The small fishing harbour at Bheemili closed over five decades ago. The fishermen said a mini fishing harbour with all modern facilities, built at a cost of Rs 50 crore, would soon become a reality. The Bheemili area is an ideal fish landing centre in Vizag, but the government has been delaying setting one up for years, they added. Stating that the fisheries department is actively considering the construction of a fish landing centre, joint director of fisheries, P Laxman Rao said IIT-Madras will make visits to Bheemili, Rajayyapeta and Mutyalammapalem in Visakhapatnam district. “Based on the report, we will submit a proposal to the government for the construction of the fish landing centre,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bheemili-likely-to-get-fish-landing-centre-soon/articleshow/87090600.cms||---

In a gazette notification issued by the NCTE a couple of days back, candidates who have acquired the qualification of three-year integrated BEd-MEd from any NCTE-recognised institution shall be considered for appointment as a teacher in classes I to V.  However, a person so appointed as a teacher shall mandatorily undergo a six-month bridge course in elementary education recognised by the NCTE, within two years of such appointment as primary teacher. Earlier, candidates having BEd special education degree were entitled to become teachers only for classes VI to VIII as per NCTE guidelines. Patna University senate member and expert on inclusive education, Kumar Sanjeev, said the B Ed special education degree should be recognised by the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI) and not necessarily from NCTE. He pointed out that the inclusive education policy was implemented in all elementary schools of the state in 2006 under which both normal (general), as well as physically challenged children, are receiving education under one roof so that there is no discrimination against the physically challenged children. He said special educators would now get an opportunity of teaching in 80,000 government schools in the state. He urged the state government to allow special educators to appear in the teachers’ eligibility test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ncte-relief-for-those-having-bed-special-education-degree/articleshow/87089956.cms||B K Mishra

Reason? While crop is higher than last season, edible oil prices may not see reduction in the opening season. Many consumers stock up for the entire year in the October-November period when fresh oil floods the market, but oil millers and exporters claim this year may prove to be exceptional as groundnut oil price is expected to remain high. Price of 15kg groundnut oil tin touched Rs 2,600 even as the government had to slash import duty on edible oil twice to curb prices in the domestic market this year. Yet, prices remained stable between Rs 2,400 and 2,500. Gujarat produces around 12 lakh tonne groundnut oil from its own crop as well as nuts that come from other states to Gujarat for crushing. Samir Shah, president of Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association said, “We are expecting good demand for export as the season starts. There is an inquiry at $1,600-1700 per tonne currently.” Last year, China’s edible oil import from India was quite high as the country had suffered crop loss. According to a rough estimate, China imported around 2.25 lakh tonne groundnut oil from India last year. China prefers groundnut oil over other edible oils and is the biggest importer of groundnut oil from India. This year too, looking at the international market scenario China’s demand is expected to remain high. An exporter of groundnut oil and peanuts, Praful Desai said, “The price of palm and soya oil is high in the international market. When the price difference between other edible oils and groundnut is narrow, China buys groundnut oil only. However, if the price difference is more than 25 percent, China then imports other oils too.” Cotton oil price too remained on par with groundnut oil. President of Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA), Kishor Viradiya, said that this year market price is expected to remain between Rs1,100 and 1,200 per 20kg. “The price of imported oil like palm and soya are high and there is 50 percent loss in cotton crop. Therefore, cotton oil price will also remain high and so will groundnut oil.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/good-groundnut-crop-may-not-cool-oil-prices-this-year/articleshow/87089792.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

In the pre-pandemic period, around 12 lakh devotees would visit the Kanaka Durga temple during Dasara for darshan. Initially, officials had decided to permit only 10,000 devotees per day during the festival this year, but that number later rose to 45,000 a day. Around 1.38 lakh devotees had darshan of Kanaka Durga in Saraswathi attire on Moola Nakshatram day this year. Meanwhile, lakhs of Bhavani devotees thronged the temple on the last two days of Dasara, making maintaining social distancing and other Covid-19 protocols a herculean task for officials. Many Bhavani devotees were seen without masks though officials distributed masks and hand sanitizers. Temple authorities made announcements and deployed volunteers to ensure that devotees maintained physical distance, but the measures failed to give results. Doctors warn that such large gatherings may increase the risk of Covid-19 spread. “Gathering at Kumbh Mela and state elections is a major reason for the second wave of Covid-19. But we ignored the past and repeated the same mistakes. We should stop blaming the government and strictly follow Covid-19 protocols,” said Dr K Arjun Raju, a physician from the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-norms-ignored-as-bhavani-devotees-flock-to-durga-temple/articleshow/87090562.cms||Venu Lanka

Patna registered around 1.22mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours. The Patna Metrological Centre said light to moderate rainfall occurred at afew places in north-east part and at one or two places in the rest of the state during the last 24 hours. The chief amount of rainfall was recorded at Taibpur (22mm), Bausi (10.8mm), Dhengraghat (10.2mm) and Galgalia (10.2mm). The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted moderate to heavy rainfall at isolated places in southern, north-west and north-central parts of Bihar on October 18 and 19 under the influence of low-pressure area that lies over north Telangana and neighbourhood. The east-west trough now runs across east-central Bay of Bengal from Gulf of Martaban to the cyclonic circulation associated with the low-pressure area. A fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal with chances of cyclogenesis (development or strengthening of low-pressure area into cyclonic circulation). Skymet Weather stated in its bulletin that another low-pressure is waiting in the wings to enter Bay of Bengal around October 17. “This weather system appears to be stronger than the current one. However, it will recurve early to largely affect West Bengal, Bihar and entire Northeast India. Bay of Bengal remains under close observation for any further development,” it said. The IMD, on the other hand, said the genesis potential parameter based on its global forecast system (GFS) model is indicating potential zone for cyclogenesis over Gulf of Martaban followed by a rapid shift in the zone towards northwest Bay of Bengal on Monday and Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expect-moderate-to-heavy-rain-for-2-more-days-met/articleshow/87090124.cms||Faryal Rumi

The BEEP project is aimed at adopting ‘Indo-Swiss energy efficient building technology’ to promote energy-efficient building design in the construction of the proposed 28 lakh houses in Andhra Pradesh. According to officials of the AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), the Indo-Swiss technology will help reduce temperature by at least 2 degrees inside the houses compared to conventional houses. It will also ensure adequate natural ventilation and day lighting potential, thereby saving a minimum 20% electricity and creating safe and healthy living conditions. In a first step towards implementation of the initiative in Andhra Pradesh, the BEEP team will conduct a seminar in Tirupati on October 22 in collaboration with APSECM and the state housing department. This capacity-building programme is expected to create awareness on Eco-Niwas Samhita (energy conservation building code for residential buildings) and energy-efficient and thermally comfortable building design. The BEEP has also decided train 500 village/ward secretariat department engineers and other employees in energy efficiency technology in the building sector. In a communique to the special chief secretary for housing, Ajay Jain, and energy secretary, Srikant Nagulapalli, director general of BEE, Abhay Bhakre said the BEE is impressed with the efforts of the Andhra Pradesh government in implementing energy conservation and energy efficiency programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/indo-swiss-bldg-tech-to-save-on-power-bills/articleshow/87090638.cms||---

The police said that Sheikh has used a large amount of the fund in religious conversion activities and also diverted money for building mosques across the country. “We are questioning Sheikh about Rs 79 crore that he got from a UK resident over the past five years in the name of his Afmi Trust. He had got Rs 60 crore by hawala and a sizeable amount of it was diverted to different states. We are also investigating if the money sent to Kashmir were used in terror funding,” the police said. “The donations received by Sheikh’s Trust were diverted outside the knowledge of other trustees. And his bank accounts too were used to transfer money to different states. We are following the money trail and questioning the duo about it,” the police added. Investigations have also revealed that about Rs 60 lakh was used to fund legal expenses of the accused in anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests that had rocked the nation’s capital last year. The SIT has already sent a summons to UK-based Yusuf Fefdawala who had sent crores of rupees by hawala to Sheikh. The police will also question Sheikh about a missing pen-drive that contains data on the funds that were diverted.  Umar was alleged to have converted over 1,000 persons in UP alone. He is suspected to be involved in mass conversions of deaf and mute students, women and children.

The authorities have completed the paperwork and the groundwork is expected to be launched soon.According to Cauvery Neeravari Nigam sources, the main ponds to be revived are of Channapattana, Satyamangala, and Hunasinakere at an estimated cost of Rs 39.2 crore, Rs 11.42 crore, and Rs 11.24 crore respectively. The main park to be restored is Maharaja Park located at the city centre at an estimated cost of Rs 14.36 crore.Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, during coalition government regime, had allocated Rs 144 crore in his budget for the development of Channapattana pond, which former minister HD Revanna had dreamt of developing on the lines of Disney Park. Later, after BJP government came into power, Hassan BJP MLA Preetham J Gowda decided to distribute the allocated fund for revival of city’s ponds and parks.“The company which had won tender is now carrying out minor activities like testing soil, clearing weeds and others. They are saying they start the work after Mysuru Dasara. The project is entirely supervised and technically controlled by Hemavathi Reservoir Project (HRP) Zone, Cauvery Neeravari Nigam. The restoration project is aimed to be completed by within two years from now. The restoration of ponds and parks is aimed to create a good ecosystem. Fencing will be provided to avoid debris to ensure good environment for residents while walking and taking rest. The project also includes installation of sewage water treatment plants,” said Venkataramanappa, deputy chief engineer, HRP.“In Channapattana pond, facilities like boating system, three-stepped stones around the pond for seating, toys and playground for children, open theatre, walking and jogging tracks with gazebos, stone benches, Yoga mandir, toilets and vehicles parking system, have been planned. Also, we have plans to construct a park to the west of new bus terminal near railway track. Remaining parks will get the facilities according to their territory. Few of them will get mini bird sanctuary and island,” Venkataramanappa added.Water for filling Hunasinakere, Satyamangala and Channapattana ponds is planned to be brought from Handinakere pond located near Yagachi Left Bund Canal.The project is completely supervised and technically controlled by Yagachi Belur Division, Belur. The three ponds water recharging project was announced in 2018-19 by former CM Siddaramaiah in his budget. This is expected to be tendered in a month from now, said Venkataramanappa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/6-lakes-9-parks-in-hassan-to-be-revived-at-a-cost-of-rs-144-cr/articleshow/87089624.cms||---

In the last two days, the civic body also held special camps inside masjids and at Jaffar Nagar Eidgah ground as a confidence building measure. Medical teams said that many among these were first dose recipients. Zonal medical officer Dr Ateequr Raheman Khan has been counselling religious leaders and masjid imams, beside people in slum areas. “Three camps were held at Eidgah, Sadar Jama Masjid, and Godavari slum on Sunday. During our interaction, people disclosed several myths like infertility, and population control regarding Covid vaccination. Our teams explained to them the benefits of vaccination, which is the only weapon against Covid right now,” said Khan. Khan added that the community members are gradually overcoming vaccine hesitancy. NMC had also set up six kiosks for antigen testing, vaccination and general health check up at Deekshabhoomi entry point from October 13 to 16. Two persons were found positive. They were shifted to AIIMS Nagpur for institutional quarantine. As per guidelines, only fully vaxxed persons were allowed entry. During this period, 1,182 visitors were vaccinated there. Of this, 719 received the first dose while 463 got their second. Over 4,400 visitors also took rapid antigen tests while 3,003 underwent health check-up.

In all, the state came third after Maharashtra and Kerala in sending students to the premier educational institute. The institute officials said that in 2020-21 batch, there were eight students that made it to NID. Call it better preparation period due to the pandemic, increase in awareness or change in admission procedure for some of the institutes, but several Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar-based premier educational institutes have recorded a slight rise in students with Gujarat domicile on campus this year. At Gujarat National Law University (GNLU), the rise was 12%, from 43 to 48 in its five-year integrated course. The number remained the same at 16 for the postgraduate course. “Due to 25% reservation for the students from Gujarat, the number of seats comes to 43. It means that the students from the state also made it to the more competitive open merit,” said an official. “From 37 students from Gujarat that got admission in 2018 cycle, the number has increased to 50 in 2020. Year-on-year, it’s a 19% rise from 42 in 2019,” said an official at IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn). At CEPT University, the overall number of students has gone up from 22% to 24%, said officials. The number at other educational institutes almost remained the same or data was not available. “The students are more aware of the national and international trends and also get trained at coaching centres even outside the state if required,” said Sameer Shah, a city-based education consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/marginal-rise-in-gujarati-students/articleshow/87091461.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED, CBI, NCB and I-T department are contract killers, says Sanjay Raut||MUMBAI: Slamming the BJP-led Centre for using central agencies to conduct raids on leaders in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena on Sunday said that “contract killings” have now been replaced by “government killings” to finish off political rivals in Maharashtra. Sena MP Sanjay Raut in his column ‘Rok Thok’ in party mouthpiece Saamna asked whether any democracy was left in the country. Raut said central agencies like the ED, CBI, NCB and I-T department were working as contract killers for the party that wields power in Delhi. “Is there a rule of law or rule of raids in Maharashtra? This is the one question that comes to mind given the record number of raids that are being conducted by central agencies. Peddling lies was anyway the business of Delhi rulers, but now this new business of conducting raids has been added to their business. This is a business without any capital investment of those in power. Use people’s money, government machinery to eliminate political opponents. This is how the trader’s mind is now working,” Raut said. Raut compared the recent raids to contract killings by hitmen hired by the Mumbai underworld in the past. Raut said that eliminating unwanted political rivals by using government machinery was the new policy of the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-cbi-ncb-and-i-t-dept-are-contract-killers-in-mumbai-raut/articleshow/87095003.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Officials cite the change in admission procedure and the pandemic as possible reasons for the trend. Bhaumik Nagar, chair (admissions) at NID, said that the institute got 87 applications from overseas aspirants, out of which 74 were holding the US passport. “It was the highest number of applicants from the US. The number was followed by 7 from the UK, and 1 each from Canada, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Maldives and Nepal,” he said, adding that 71 or 82% of the applicants were women. Out of the total, 19 made it to the admitted students — including 14 from the US, 3 from the UK, and 1 each from Nepal and Japan.

---||Mumbai||2 copters seized by BMC may fetch only scrap value?||MUMBAI: Two helicopters parked in Juhu airport that the BMC had seized to recover pending property tax dues from a private company won’t fetch the civic body more than the flying machines’ scrap value, said aviation sources in the know. The private company owed BMC Rs 1.64 crore as property tax on March 2019, which will go up to Rs 4.12 crore by March 2022, said a BMC document. “Sold as scrap, each of these Ecureuil AS 350 single-engine helicopters would fetch about Rs 25 lakh,” the aviation source said. The two helicopters have been lying at the Juhu hangar for years now with lapsed ‘Certificate of Airworthiness’ . Without a current airworthiness certificate, a plane can only stay grounded. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation issues this certificate for aircraft that undergo the prescribed timely maintenance process. The said company had a non-scheduled/charter operator’s permit and kept a fleet of one twin-engine helicopter, an MI-172 which was used for offshore operations and a couple of single-engine helicopters that operated charter flights on land. But the twin-engine helicopter was involved in a major off-shore accident in 2003 that killed 23 ONGC employees. Following the tragedy, the company ran into numerous problems and its finances went downhill, said industry sources. “Last year, the BMC seized the two, rather old, single-engine helicopters. These haven’t flown for years now, they have been lying in the company’s hangar in Juhu airport, without maintenance. Over and above, proximity to the sea makes aircraft prone to corrosion. But for scrap value, BMC cannot expect much from the sale of these aircraft,” the source added. This is not the first time that aircraft seized to recover pending dues have been found to be in poor condition. Punjab & Maharashtra Coop Bank had tried twice to sell two aircraft belonging to the Wadhawans. But the aircraft had lapsed airworthiness certificates, with no routine maintenance carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-copters-seized-by-bmc-may-fetch-only-scrap-value/articleshow/87095006.cms||Manju V

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has prepared the zone-wise data of unvaccinated persons based on number of people jabbed at centres in the areas and estimated eligible population. The difference has come out to be around 4.61 lakh people who are yet to be vaccinated across all 10 zones in the city limits as on October 13. The data was compiled to direct the drive for administering the first dose to maximum number of people during the state’s Kavach Kundal Mission, which is aimed at inoculating a crore people by October 15. The civic body deployed more teams of health workers in zone like Satranjipura, Ashi Nagar, Gandhibagh, Nehru Nagar and Hanuman Nagar, where it was easier to conduct door to door survey. Additional municipal Commissioner Ram Joshi said unless a door to door survey is done, it can’t be said actually how many people are unvaccinated in each zone. “Initially, some zones got a headstart as major centres like Indira Gandhi Rughnalya, and KT Nagar Hospital were operational. Residents of other areas would also go and take the jab. Naturally, such zones will have higher achievement on paper,” he said. Joshi added that still the data serves as an indicator of focus areas for the health department. “It is easier to survey smaller zones and cover more people. In Laxmi Nagar or Dharampeth, having long radius, house to house survey is not possible. In these areas, we are only reaching out to densely populated areas,” he said. As per the NMC estimate, over 87,000 each in Satranjipura and Ashi Nagar zones are yet to take their first jab. As compared to this, Dharampeth zone has 2,713 more beneficiaries jabbed than its eligible population, confirming that people from other parts also got vaccinated in centres there. Similarly, under the ‘workplace’ head, 48,627 more people have been jabbed than the target. The second dose pendency is huge in all 10 zones accounting for a collective balance of 11.88 lakh doses. As per public health department estimate, 37.44 lakh people are eligible for vaccination in Nagpur district. Of these, 19.73 lakh are eligible in urban area. As on date, over 41.15 lakh vaccinations have been done in the district. Of these, 28 lakh have received their first dose while nearly 13lakh have got both their doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-61-lakh-yet-to-be-jabbed-in-city-limits-nmc-data/articleshow/87091437.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The civil aviation ministry has given the nod to domestic flights to operate at 100% capacity, effective October 18. On average, 20,000 passengers transit through the city airport and this number is expected to increase during the festive season, suggest estimates of the SVPI airport spokesperson. “We advise all our passengers to reach the airport well in advance for security checks owing to the ongoing high alert situation,” said the spokesperson, in response to an email query from TOI. Anticipating the rush, even travel agents are requesting their clients to reach the airport early, especially during the peak hours. “The majority of passengers at the city airport travel during the peak hours and the rush is already high,” said Manish Sharma, chairman, Gujarat region, Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI). “People have to wait in queues right from the entrance to the check-in and security check zones.” Sharma added: “Looking at the bookings we are getting, the passenger rush during the coming few weeks will certainly increase and we are requesting our clients to report early to avoid any unnecessary delays.” The airport data suggests that approximate flight movements during this festive season has crossed 190 over a 24-hour period, with 45 flights in the morning and 45 in the evening and approximately 100 movements spread out during the day. To effectively manage the passenger rush, airport authorities said that they are putting additional measures in place. “Stringent safety and security measures have been further enhanced at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport,” said the spokesperson of the airport. “We have also enhanced seating capacity at both the terminals for a comfortable waiting experience.” There will be proactive queue management at the entry gate, check-in, and security points while ensuring social distancing. A curb-side vehicle queuing mitigation plan is in place and a dedicated airport executive will be deployed for seamless passenger query assistance. “These team members will ensure a quick yet safe turnaround at all the security checkpoints for a smooth passenger experience,” the spokesperson added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/festive-flier-rush-reach-airport-well-in-advance/articleshow/87091448.cms||---

The freight rates for some countries have more than doubled while in most of the other cases there has been an increase of 40-45%. Besides, there is a severe shortage of containers that is causing huge delays in shipping. Since last year, there has been fluctuations in the freight rates, but businessmen say the current rates are the highest ever.Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), says, “Doing export business has become unviable due to very high increase in shipping freight charges. On an average, there has been an increase of 40-45%, and there are several countries where sending export consignments now costs more than double. This is an unprecedented rise and there is a shortage of containers, too, that is making matters worse. It is our request to the Centre to take serious note of the issue, as it not only is increasing our expenditure and cost of doing business, but also leading to a drop in exports due to increase in investment. Many businessmen are now switching to local sales.”Akshay Gupta, a city-based exporter, says, “There has been a big increase in the freight rates of export containers. About six months ago and even last year, the export freight for destinations like Dubai was about 200 USD, which now is 1,500 USD. In case of export freight rates for the USA, the earlier cost was about 2,000-2,500 USD per container and now it has skyrocketed to 12,000 USD, which is almost six times. In such a situation, we are left with no option but to wait for the rates to decrease, but it seems unlikely that it will happen anytime soon.”According to Rohit Gupta, president of Importer and Exporter Club, Punjab, “The importers are facing a tough time right now as on one side duties and taxes have increased on imports and on the other the freight cost has reached such levels that it has become very difficult to carry on with the business. The freight rate for importing one container from China’s Guangzhou to Tughlakabad in India has now gone up to 9,000 USD, which earlier was 4,800 USD, an almost double increase. In the current situation, we are forced to pay for increased costs from our pockets and are suffering losses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hike-in-shipping-containers-freight-charges-has-impex-bizmen-at-sea/articleshow/87089661.cms||Mohit Behl

Members of the Chandigarh School Bus Operators Welfare Association (CSBOWA) hope to get back in business with schools but they also have a few demands. Association members recently raised the issue of road tax and relaxation in the life span of their buses by a few years on the grounds that the buses were off the roads for two years, during which the association suffered losses. Now that schools are reopening, a few parents are looking forward to the transport facility provided by the school. Manjit Singh Saini, president, CSBOWA said, “We are ready to resume operations but the administration should start the fully offline mode so that students start coming to school. Till the time classes go fully offline, how can we think of running buses on the road. Schools have issued consent forms and are trying to gauge if parents demand transportation facility or not.” With school bus operations coming to a complete halt over the last 18 months, it has become extremely difficult for drivers and operators to survive. Association members want Chandigarh school buses to be exempted from road tax from the period between March 2020 and March 2022. They also urged the UT administration to waive off their late fee and penalty on road tax/fitness test. They said that if there are not enough students taking the bus facility, they would not be able to cover their expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bus-operators-hopeful-but-cautious-as-schools-reopen/articleshow/87091463.cms||---

The Met department officials have confirmed the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from the state. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded maximum temperatures of 31.6°C and 32°C, respectively. “The city will not receive rainfall at least for the next few days. The day temperature in and around Pune is likely to increase to 34 -35°C due to clear skies,” an IMD official said. However, Marathwada and north Madhya Maharashtra are likely to experience thunderstorms and lightning activity till Tuesday. “About 10 districts are likely to experience these weather conditions for the next few days. Among these districts are Ahmednagar, Nashik, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Nanded, Parbhani, Jalna, Dhule, Nandurbar, and Hingoli. The day temperature is likely to soar in the Western Maharashtra regions, which include Pune and neighbouring districts due to clear weather conditions,” added the official. “The low-pressure area over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Kerala has become less marked and is now seen as a trough from south interior Karnataka to south Tamil Nadu at lower levels. Under its influence, isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over coastal Karnataka, Kerala, and the Mahe district of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, with a significant reduction. Thereafter, a fresh spell of the easterly wave is likely to affect south peninsular India from October 20 and cause widespread rainfall with isolated heavy showers over Kerala, Mahe, south interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for three to four days,” said the official. “Due to strong easterly winds from Bay of Bengal, heavy rainfall activity is very likely to continue over east India till October 20, with fairly widespread to widespread light to moderate rainfall with heavy rainfall at isolated places, is very likely over Odisha on October 18. Also, due to strong southerly/southeasterlies from Bay of Bengal over northeast India, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura are likely to get rainfall during October 18-21,” added the official. Moderate to severe thunderstorms accompanied with lighting and squally winds (speed reaching occasionally 40-50kmph) are likely in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, northeast Rajasthan, north Madhya Pradesh, and Gangetic West Bengal in the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dry-warm-days-in-store-for-city-imd/articleshow/87091490.cms||Sandip Dighe

After the celebration, they were returning home when they found a bike parked in the middle of road and its three riders standing nearby in Balaji Nagar.” “Deepak Kumar objected to it and asked the trio to stand on roadside. This triggered an argument and they hurled abuses at each other. When Deepak Kumar, Badal and Sonu left, the accused chased them, picked up a stick and attacked Deepak Kumar on head. Badal and Sonu rushed from there to call for help. By the time they returned, the accused had escaped after assaulting Deepak Kumar,” Gupta added. Jamalpur police station SHO Kulwant Singh Malhi said, “The accused have no criminal record and were captured on a CCTV camera installed near the spot.” A case has been registered under section 302 (murder) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/road-rage-3-arrested-for-murdering-jamalpur-man/articleshow/87089693.cms||---

It has sought an action taken report from the directorate of education within one month. The complaint stated that a Sakhali-based school didn’t admit a student with cerebral palsy locomotor disability. Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) welcomed the commission’s decision, calling it a path-breaking order towards inclusive education. However, it expressed its displeasure over the time taken to dispose the matter as the commission took three months, as a result of which the child had to lose one term of his education. DRAG demanded that cases related to children and persons with disability should be disposed off on priority basis by various commissions and courts, including the high court. The parents received a call from the assistant director of education ,North Goa, saying the school has no facilities for children with disabilities, and hence admission can’t be granted. After the child’s name didn’t appear on the admission list, the parents approached the directorate of education but received no respite, they informed the commission. They then approached the commission. The school denied the allegations, and stated that it has a capacity of 40 students in a class and one division each from Class V to X, and that it received an overwhelming response from students where 80 applied for Class V where the present capacity is only 40. The school stated that it followed criteria of first-come, first-serve basis, gender balance and priority to next siblings, and also stated that the parents did not produce certificate of disability, nor informed about disability of the student at the time of admission. The school added that due to huge pendency of applications, it applied for additional class for standard 5th from the current academic year in an application dated May 26 to the director of education, and also informed that if approved, they will admit all students on waiting list, including the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/childrens-commission-recommends-admission-to-child-with-disability/articleshow/87093812.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parsi apex body crisis looms, former trustee on stir||MUMBAI: A leadership crisis in the over 300-year-old Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) intensified over the weekend with a trustee planning a hunger fast from Monday morning. Noshir Dadrawala, who resigned last week, protesting against the majority trustees’ decision to postpone the BPP elections to October 2022, said, “This is a serious attempt on my part to ensure good governance through peaceful, non-violent means.” “I will be sitting at the BPP office (D N Rd in Fort) and sleeping there at night till such time as this illegal resolution is revoked,’’ he said in a statement. While many lauded Dadrawala for taking a principled stand, others accused him of staging a publicity stunt. A community senior, who did not wish to be identified, said, ``This sorry state of affairs should be brought to the notice of the Charity Commissioner, who should then issue a notice to the trustees to either perform or perish.’’ There was a flurry of messages on social media in reaction to Dadrawala’s announcement. “He will tear up his resignation letter and return, saying he had to heed the voice of his legions of supporters who threatened to commit suicide if he didn’t,” said one. However, Dadrawala seemed intent: “In my 60 years, I have never fasted. I love my food and it shows on my face. But I realise I love truth and the right path even more.” He claimed the “illegal resolution” passed by the BPP chairman and trustee Viraf Mehta to postpone elections is in violation of a Bombay high court order. Trustee Viraf Mehta countered Dadrawala saying the BPP has outstanding payments of Rs 11 crore and holding elections to fill up two seats now would entail a cost of Rs 40 lakh. He said the board has also passed a resolution to move for an amendment to reduce the term of a trustee from seven years to five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parsi-apex-body-crisis-looms-former-trustee-on-stir/articleshow/87095063.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

They also wrote a letter to Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN), asking officials to ensure proper supply during the festive season. President, Citizen Welfare Association S K Nayar said Punjab and Delhi are affected by power-cuts due to improper working of thermal plants in the wake of coal shortage but in Haryana, where the situation was not so bad, residents still faced power cuts. Nayar said UHBVN was imposing power cuts for about three to eight hours a day and officials would attribute it to maintenance work whenever contacted. Nayar said that on Saturday, power supply snapped at around 10am and was restored only by around 4pm. CWA members wrote a complaint letter to the superintendent engineer and executive engineer about this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-cuts-hamper-festive-cheer/articleshow/87091533.cms||---

As per the order of the ministry dated October 12, the government has decided to restore the scheduled domestic operations with effect from October 18 without any capacity restriction. Airport officials said after the ministry’s order, they have taken up the matter with Air India that flies the lone flight between Ludhiana and Delhi. Airport director S K Saran said he has communicated to Alliance Air to resume the flight. The last flight between Ludhiana and Delhi had operated on April 9. An officer of Air India said earlier, it had been announced that the flight will remain suspended till October 31, and they don’t know whether the flight will operate after that. A fewer number of 72 ATR planes for multiple destinations may be reason for suspension of the flight and the situation may continue, the official added. He said but they are getting queries from passengers about resumption of the flight. Meanwhile, residents also are waiting eagerly for the flight to start. “It is the lone flight connecting Ludhiana and Delhi. With its suspension for so many months, people are the receiving end as it is the fastest mode of travel. We want the authorities concerned to resume the flight which is of great for various communities, including businessmen, professionals and students,” said Gurpreet Singh, a city resident. Box: Low occupancy The data of Delhi-Ludhiana flights in the first 20 days of March, the average occupancy of the flight was mostly below 50%. It was 52.14% on March 20 and had fallen to 30% by March 27 when the last flight operated in the month. In April, the average flight occupancy was between 31.4 to 37.14%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/airport-officials-ask-air-india-to-resume-ludhiana-delhi-flight/articleshow/87089757.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Ludhiana||Farm laws’ issue simmers, poll activity on back burner||Raikot/Jagraon: The assembly elections are a few months away, but unlike the past, political activity is still to hit a feverish pitch here. The villagers say they are focused on farm agitation and political parties need to get the black laws repealed first. “As of now our focus is on the agitation against farm laws, so no one is discussing elections. Some time ago, a political party had painted its publicity material on the walls at two places in the village, but someone blackened it. During earlier Vidhan Sabha elections, politicians would start making rounds of our village by this time, but till now no one is seen here,” says Chamkaur Singh, a villager from Chakkar. He says things may change after model code of conduct comes into force. Villagers may allow political activity, but will ask parties to pressurise the Union government to scrap farm laws, he adds. The scene was no different in the neighbouring Malla village. “Though there is no political activity, once polls are announced, we will participate in the democratic process. It’s farmers’ agitation that is on everyone’s mind and the voters will set the agenda for political parties,” says 52-year-old villager Jagtar Singh. He says the fate of opposition parties will depend on how chief minister Charanjit Channi’s government performs before the polls are announced. Jagdeep Singh, a political activist from the village who owes allegiance to the ruling Congress, says there is no political activity, but there is still time for elections and voters change in a day if things on ground alter. However, a section of villagers wants the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to field candidates. “Many feel that the Morcha should field candidates, so that they can fight against the farm laws. These laws are the main issue this time as these concern our present and future generations. We will fight till we win,” says Paramjit Singh from Hathur village, which is among many hamlets in the district where posters banning political activity were put up.A villager from Raikot says they feel the Centre will not scrap farm laws soon, so the fight against these will have to be fought after elections too. Besides farmers’ agitation, other issues include drugs, sacrilege incidents, unemployment and development, he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/farm-laws-issue-simmers-poll-activity-on-back-burner/articleshow/87089775.cms||Shariq Majeed

Her sister Mangala Tulshidas Kamat, 75, was killed in the process of saving her, Ponda police said. “The accused had borrowed Rs 2.2 lakh from the deceased and had to repay Rs 2.6 lakh, which included interest. Since the accused was reluctant to pay the instalments, the deceased was relentlessly pressing him to return the money,” Singh said. Ponda police picked up accused Mahadev Ghadi, 34, from his house at Bayem in Surla on Sunday. He has been remanded in four-day police custody. “During interrogation, the accused confessed of commission of crime and disclosed that he had taken a loan from Jeevan and since she was pressing him to return the amount, he killed her using a deadly weapon — a koita — taken from their house and thereafter her sister Mangala when she intervened to rescue her,” Singh said. Ponda PI Mohan Gaude said that the autopsies have confirmed that the multiple injuries on their heads were the cause of their death. The sisters, who were living together for the last two decades at a centrally-located building in Ponda town, were brutally murdered on Saturday afternoon. The murder came to light after Magala’s son, Pritish, who lives on the floor above, came to visit them. Senior superintendent of police (SSP), South Goa, Pankaj Kumar Singh told reporters that the presence of the accused at the crime scene was traced with the help of CCTV footage captured on a camera in the neighbouring house, which was later verified with his mobile phone location. After inquiring about his relations with the deceased, police learnt about the money deal. Based on primary investigation, the accused was apprehended. The accused was working as an operator for a private company which has a flat in the building for their staff’s use. Since the accused had been using the flat for over a decade, he was known to the sisters and their family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-double-murder-over-borrowed-money-police/articleshow/87093667.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Vijayawada||Setback for TDP in Duggirala caste row||Amaravati: Delivering a jolt to the TDP’s chances of winning Duggirala mandal parishad chairperson post, Guntur district collector Vivek Yadav has turned down the request of TDP MPTC Jabeen Begum to issue Backward Classes-E caste certificate to her. Collector refused to treat Jabeen under backward classes after conducting a thorough inquiry into the credentials of her family members. Collector noted that all the paternal family members of Jabeen belong to Mohammed community within the Muslims and ‘Mohammed’ was not included in the BC-E list.  Though Jabeen’s husband belongs to Shaik community which is a listed BC-E community, it is not applicable to Jabeen, said the collector. In her petition, Jabeen said her children were given BC-E certificates in the past. Yadav clarified that her children could get the certificate because their father belonged to Shaik community.  Collector’s decision has virtually dashed TDP’s hopes to win the mandal parishad president seat in Duggirala. TDP won 9 MPTC seats, YSRC 8 and Jana Sena bagged one seat in elections of which results were declared last month. Though TDP got majority seats in the mandal parishad, it abstained from attending the first general body meeting held on September 25 to elect the president as the party candidate Jabeen could not secure the caste certificate to contest the polls. She is the lone candidate in the TDP camp to contest for the president post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/setback-for-tdp-in-duggirala-caste-row/articleshow/87089782.cms||Samdani MN

It is expected that 10,000 new voters will participate in this poll, a large number that will have an impact on the outcome. Parties are also going to great lengths to secure postal ballots. Though parties are keen on attracting new voters, they are concerned about voter turnout with the margins predicted to be narrow. There are 2.36 lakh existing voters and the new additions are expected to make a difference for all of the candidates. According to sources, it was a relief for both the TRS and the BJP because field assistants were unable to file nominations as they were unemployed youth. Despite the fact that YSRTP president YS Sharmila encouraged unemployed youth in the state to file as many nominations as possible for the Huzurabad by-election and even invited applications, only 30 candidates remained in the running. Parties are also concentrating on postal votes. Postal voting is now available for Covid- 19 patients and those over the age of 80. More than 800 people have applied for postal voting so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-bypoll-approaches-parties-vying-for-attention-of-new-voters/articleshow/87093726.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Rising diesel price sets fire to kitchen budgets||KOLKATA: The diesel price is steadily marching towards the century mark, now costlier by Rs 20.26 a litre than what it was a year ago. The petrol price crossed Rs 105 and is now costlier by Rs 23 than a year ago. While auto LPG price has touched Rs 57.95 a litre, cooking gas is nearing Rs 1,000 for a 14.2kg domestic cylinder. The sharp rise of fuel prices has set kitchen budgets on fire and resulted in skyrocketing commuting costs. Diesel is only Rs 3.41 short of Rs 100 a litre. With the public vehicles running on diesel, the transportation of both goods and passengers has become more expensive, thus pushing up the costs of essentials and commute. “Our commuting cost has increased nearly four-fold. These days buses are fewer on the roads, so we have become dependent on autos and cabs. Now, I have to spend Rs 200 on an average a day. While commuting on the same route, my transportation cost never exceeded Rs 50 a day earlier before the lockdown,” said Anirban Ghatak, a bank employee. “Considering the current rate of hike, it is likely that the diesel price will touch Rs 100 a litre in the next 15 days, shooting up the prices of everything further. The prices of all essential commodities have seen a spike by more than 50% in the last one year,” said Kamal De, member, Bengal Government Task Force and president, West Bengal Vendors and Farmers Association. Vegetable prices are going up steadily. In October, the price of 14.2kg domestic cooking gas cylinder stood at a record high of Rs 926, but in Kalimpong, each cylinder is priced at Rs 1,055. In Malda, it is Rs 3 less than Rs 1,000. “It is only a matter of time until the price goes beyond Rs1,000 mark in the city,” said an oil marketing company (OMC) official. In the last one year, cooking gas became costlier by Rs 306 while it was Rs 620 on August 1 last year. “The kitchen budget has not only gone haywire but it is also eating up our family budget. We are forced to cut corners severely with my post retirement income nosediving for successive cuts in the interest of small savings,” said Ashok Ganguly, a retired citizen. “We are constantly on a tight-rope walk. Any small deviation comes with an adverse economic impact. I have stopped using car and bike. The cost of everything has gone up drastically, burning bigger holes in our pockets. If the fuel prices are not controlled, it will be a challenge to run households,” said Ruma Ghosh, a college teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-diesel-price-sets-fire-to-kitchen-budgets/articleshow/87091626.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The Rs 275 crore project is a part of seven hospitals that Delhi government has targeted to construct in the next six months with a total capacity of 6,834 beds. “As a responsible government, we are taking all important steps needed to counter a possible third Covid-19 wave. Delhi government is going to build seven hospitals with a total capacity of 6,800 beds within six months,” said Kejriwal, adding that the step was taken in view of the shortage of oxygen and ICU beds seen during the second Covid-19 wave. Congratulating the Public Works Department for starting the ambitious project and for being confident of completing it within six months, Kejriwal said, “I think it will probably be a world record that within six months seven hospitals with 6,800 beds will be ready. Every bed in the hospital at Shalimar Bagh will have oxygen and ICU infrastructure. You can use it as a normal bed and, if the need arises, use it as an ICU facility.” Apart from Shalimar Bagh, Delhi government is constructing hospitals at Sarita Vihar, Sultanpuri, Kirari, Raghubir Nagar and within the campuses of GTB Hospital and Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya. PWD is largely using precast building materials, along with an energy-efficient and environment-friendly approach for constructing the healthcare facilities. Kejriwal said before the Aam Aadmi Party government was formed, the cost per bed in a hospital came to around Rs 1 crore. “The total cost of this hospital is Rs 275 crore. Considering that it will have 1,430 beds, the cost comes to Rs 20 lakh per bed, that too with ICU facility. All other facilities, including centralised airconditioning, will be there. This has been possible only because the people of Delhi have elected an honest government,” he added. “The health infrastructure in Delhi is the best compared with government hospitals across the country. However, Delhi government wants to make the facilities world-class. In the coming days, we are going to implement the Health Information Management System. Within one and a half years, every Delhiite will have a health card and all their old medical reports and other data will be available on the system. You will just have to make an appointment with a doctor online and reach the hospital at the given time,” said Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3rd-wave-in-mind-ball-set-rolling-for-1430-bed-hospital-in-n-delhi/articleshow/87091905.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Vijayawada||Stalemate as T keen on keeping projects||Amaravati: Stalemate over the enforcement of river boards gazette notification is continuing with Telangana government refusing to hand over the hydro electrical power projects. The river boards’ chiefs have reportedly sought the intervention of the jal shakti ministry which is likely to conduct a video-conference with both states next week. The Andhra Pradesh government is keenly waiting for the Centre to enter the scene and initiate measures for the implementation of the notification. The state is likely to request the Centre to deploy CISF companies at the projects proposed by the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) for the enforcement of the gazette notification. In fact, the AP government has pushed both jal shakti ministry and river boards into corner by issuing separate GOs expressing its willingness to hand over all the installations on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects as resolved at the board meeting last week. Andhra Pradesh government has also agreed to hand over the power projects on its soil. The AP government issued the GO with a condition that the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) should take measures to take over the projects from both AP and Telangana simultaneously. The decision of AP government to honour the ministry’s gazette notification as well as the resolution cleared by the river board governing council has put it on a moral high ground, political analysts feel. “AP’s strategic move to hand over the projects on Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar has left the Centre with no exit route but to enforce the gazette notification issued by it. It has to be seen as to how it is going to implement the law,” said a retired chief engineer of irrigation department. The river board chiefs made several attempts to convince Telangana for the smooth implementation of the gazette notification during the board meetings. However, Telangana has been challenging boards’ decisions. Though Telangana has withdrawn a pending case in Supreme Court with the hope that the Centre would constitute a separate tribunal for reallocation of Krishna waters, jal shakti ministry is in no mood to stir the hornet’s nest as many of Telangana’s demands would create new troubles and are against the existing rules and laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stalemate-as-t-keen-on-keeping-projects/articleshow/87089787.cms||Samdani MN

Almost everything in the state has either reopened or scheduled for reopening, but coaching institutes have been left out of that ambit for now. Speaking to TOI, Raut said, “I am very much in favour of reopening of the coaching institutes, but this time the recommendation has to come from the state. The task force will frame the guidelines for the same and recommend how to go about it (phase-wise, capacity etc). Once these guidelines are received, we will implement it.” There is, however, no timeline as of now as far as the task force’s guidelines are concerned. Raut said, “We have already reopened schools, and colleges are all set to go the same way within a few days. After observing the situation post this reopening, I believe, the task force will give directives to us.” This calendar year did see reopening of coaching institutes, but with limited capacity. In the first phase, these were allowed to have maximum 20 students in classrooms, which was later increased to 50% of seating capacity. Coaching institutes across the state have expressed disappointment over being ignored by the government. In Pune, permission had been given to coaching institutes, but it was withdrawn soon after. Seeking clarity on the issue, Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) president Rajnikant Bondre had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week. The chief minister’s office (CMO) has forwarded the e-mail to the department of higher and technical education. There is no response from the department, so far. This, however, could turn into a bureaucratic maze because coaching institutes do not come under either the school education or higher education departments. In fact, ACI has been asking the government to categorize them properly so that they know whom to approach with the sector-specific issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-institutes-to-reopen-after-task-force-advice-raut/articleshow/87091668.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kolkata||Can’t hold practical exams before Feb: CISCE schools||Kolkata: A circular reached school heads on Saturday from the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations that asked them to start preparing for physical practical examinations for ISC examinees between October 25 and February 28. However, school authorities in the city said that it will not be possible for them to hold the exams now and they will have to wait till February next year as the state has not allowed the re-opening of schools and the Class-XII have not had any lab experience. Moreover, the first semester exams are also going to start from November 15 and will go on till December. So, the board examinees will not be able to take the burden of the practical exams. The circular contains details about the methodology to be followed while conducting the practical exams at schools. It also says that the school heads will be provided with sample questions, from which visiting examiners will be preparing question papers for different batches. Most schools in the city will re-open on October 25, after which they will utilise the time before the first semester exams for revision and complete some portions of the syllabus for the second term too. Immediately after the first semester exams are over, there will be a winter break. “The winter break ends in mid-January, and assuming the fact that the state government would allow us to re-open by then, we can call the students to the campus for practical classes. Once they are ready, we can arrange to hold the practical exams,” said John Stephen, acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys. He added that the Council will instruct school heads on October 21 and things will become clearer then. “Since schools in many states have resumed classes on campuses for some time now, it is possible for them to arrange for practical exams for the ISC candidates in October, whereas we will have to wait for instructions from the state government to re-open,” said Sonali Sen, principal of DPS Newtown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cant-hold-practical-exams-before-feb-cisce-schools/articleshow/87091711.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The students and junior doctors of the hospital have been on the hunger strike since October 3 with demands over several issues. The meeting between the agitating medicos and Trinamool members was held at Mohit Mancha in Tallah on Sunday afternoon. But the students refused to accept the conditions offered by the state representatives. Initially, 30 students and junior doctors had been on the strike on Sunday. Later, the number came down to 11 as others withdrew from the stir due to poor health conditions. They have been demanding transparency in setting up students’ council. The students alleged that instead of an apolitical students’ council, principal Sandip Ghosh was indulging in setting it up with students associated with a particular political party. Hence, they demanded the principal’s removal. The students had earlier gheraoed the principal who was later rescued by cops. The students are also demanding a ladies’ hostel and a transparent policy in allocation of hostel rooms. “We wanted the agitating students to restore normalcy. We promised to review the situation after a month as we do not want the service to be hampered,” Sen said. A state official said the principal’s removal was not possible as it would send out a wrong message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rg-kar-stir-on-as-talks-with-mp-mlas-fail/articleshow/87091651.cms||---

Sule was in Chandrapur to take part in the party meet on Sunday. “Earlier too, people had made tall claims of having truckload of evidence. They keep making false charges for publicity. Initially, I used to get worried after allegations were made. But now I don’t care,” she said. About alliance between MVA constituent parties during the upcoming local body elections, Sule claimed nothing has been decided yet. Senior leaders including Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray would sit together and decide over forging the alliance, she said. Sule denied having any aspiration about becoming chief minister in future. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is doing excellent work. His work during the Covid crises is commendable. Maharashtra has emerged on the top in vaccination in the country under his leadership,” she said. On internal dispute between city and district bodies of the party in Chandrapur, the MP said disagreement is acceptable, but there should be dialogue between the party leaders. She also called upon the leaders and party workers to work together to strengthen the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/somaiyas-charges-to-seek-publicity-sule/articleshow/87091690.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Nagpur||No Itwari-Nagbhid rly project sans mitigation steps: Aaditya||Nagpur: Maharashtra minister of tourism and environment, Aaditya Thackeray, has said that the Itwari-Nagbhid gauge conversion project cannot become a reality unless mitigation measures as suggested by the state forest department are implemented. According to sources, of the total project length, mitigation measures suggested by the department in the critical tiger corridors of Umred-Karhandla-Paoni wildlife sanctuary and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) are 28%, which are 10% more than suggestions of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. The mitigation structures suggested by the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (MRIDC) are unscientific and hardly 5%, said sources. In Section II, while the forest department suggested a 3.7km single elevated structure in the critical corridor, WII gave an option of three structures of 400, 500, and 700 metre. During discussions, PCCF (wildlife) went by 3,700 metre elevated structure. Thackeray had raised the issue in the 17th State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) meeting. Thackeray told TOI that if at all the gauge conversion is to happen, it will only be after implementing the mitigation measures as suggested by the forest department. MRIDC, a joint venture of state government and ministry of railways on 50:50 cost-sharing, is implementing the 116km project to transport coal and passenger trains too. The project will not only increase the speed of trains four times than narrow gauge, but the frequency will also go up. While preparing the detailed project report, no provision for wildlife mitigation measures was made though the Rs1,400 crore linear project cutting across the functional tiger corridor. A fait accompli situation was created by starting work in the corridor, thus violating the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The cost is likely to be escalated by Rs250-300 crore due to the mitigation measures. On October 12, TOI had reported how the MRIDC officials were reluctant to take the steps and through alleged political pressure got a five-member committee set up by MoEFCC to review the measures as suggested by the WII, which has proposed seven structures totaling 3.550km length with sizes of 300 to 800 metre. The committee comprising representatives of PCCF (wildlife), NTCA & WII representatives, and DIG (wildlife) conducted a site visit on October 8 and 9, during which the violations were noticed. As per rules, whenever any developmental project comes up in a protected area, tiger reserve or the corridors, it requires wildlife clearance from SBWL and the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye has made it clear that the MRIDC had started some work in the corridor area. “Last year, despite our field officers asking them to stop till formal wildlife clearance is given, the work continued. I will seek the factual report from the field officers,” said Limaye. “Secondly, we have clearly told the user agency that whatever mitigation measures WII has suggested, we will go by that, because this is a vital tiger corridor and human-tiger conflict-prone area. After the clearance by NBWL, user agency can take up the work in corridor area with recommended mitigation measures,” said Limaye. SBWL member Kundan Hate said, “In the 16th meeting of SBWL, the CM had categorically said that first check if gauge conversion of Itwari–Nagbhid railway is at all needed. If needed, make it elevated to safeguard critical tiger corridors to Tadoba landscape, the CM had said.” The main aim of this project is to expedite coal movement from mines and reduce congestion on the existing route. Itwari-Nagbhid-Chandrapur will be directly linked with the existing railway network via Umred to Wardha and Gondia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-itwari-nagbhid-rly-project-sans-mitigation-steps-aaditya/articleshow/87091718.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||IIT Bombay’s zone first on JEE Advanced top 500 list, but 3rd overall||MUMBAI: IIT aspirants from north India have consistently outperformed their counterparts from other corners of the country for the fourth consecutive year. The IIT Bombay zone grabbed the top spot in the JEE Advanced 2021 results with the largest cohort of students in the first 500 ranks, followed by the IIT Hyderabad zone, with the IIT Delhi zone a close third. But when the overall numbers were tallied, the IIT Delhi zone once again emerged at the top position with the maximum aspirants — 8,142 — to have made the cut in the JEE (Advanced) 2021 results. “I would say that these must vary over the years and should not be taken for any conclusive statements,” said JEE Advanced chairman Debashish Chakravarty of IIT Kharagpur. IIT Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri said a lot has to do with awareness, the environment at home, the upbringing of children. “The IIT Bombay zone has done very well with so many students in the top 100. But if you look at the overall numbers, they may be a bit less than Delhi, but we are significantly higher than many other zones. A lot has to do with the opportunities presented by parents to their children. For instance, commerce is popular here, and hence students get divided across streams. But in Delhi, which has a huge population that is administrative, the focus is more on engineering and professional courses.” IIT Delhi is incidentally home to the highest number of top 10 rankers. Last year, the southern zone saw the best performance in terms of students in the top 500 ranks, though this time it is the IIT Bombay zone. Overall, while 2020 saw the number of qualified students rising, this year saw a drop again. Despite a drop in the minimum percentage of aggregate marks from 25% in 2019 to 17.5% in 2020, which remained constant, this time around too, candidates making it to the finish line fell by 1,342. The qualifying aggregate marks for common rank list dropped to 63, lower than last year’s 69. The total number of seats has increased to 16,232 from last year’s 16,053 and 13,000 in 2019. Also, the Joint Seat Allocation Authority has released the admission schedule. While registrations for admissions have kickstarted, the first mock seat allocation list would be up on October 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-bombays-zone-first-on-jee-adv-top-500-list-but-3rd-overall/articleshow/87095130.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Nagpur||Blink frequently to save eye from computer vision syndrome: Docs||Nagpur: Renowned ophthalmologists have cautioned netizens to blink frequently while using laptops, desktops, mobile phones or tabs for a long time to avoid an eye ailment ‘computer vision syndrome’ which has suddenly become common and is affecting a large section of the population due to over exposure of screen time which has increased in the last one and a half years during the lockdown. Dr Ratna Vishwakarma, an eye surgeon with a experience of 34 years, said she is witnessing unprecedented numbers of patients with ‘compute vision syndrome’, especially IT professionals engaged in work from home and children having online classes. “Least concern about resting or taking care of one’s eyes and minimum blinking are leading to ‘computer vision syndrome’ as the screen time has increased,” she said. Dr Bodhraj Dhawan, an ophthalmologist and vitreo-retina surgeon attached to Alexis multispecialty hospital, said one must frequently blink and avoid long hours of continuously using the digital screens. “As we don't blink, the tear film gets disrupted and cannot uniformly lubricate the ocular surface (frontal surface of the eye) which becomes dry. Blinking 10-12 times a minute helps tear film spreads across the eye and saves it from dryness and itchiness,” said Dr Dhawan, adding, netizens must improve their computer behavior. “The convergence of the muscles on the near target leaves them fatigued which translates into headaches. We are getting patients with headaches and dryness of eyes leading to itching and watering,” he said, adding, many children are landing up at his clinic with the computer vision syndrome. Dr Dhawan said he has been prescribing anti-glare glasses to patients. He has also suggested looking at the sky by taking a break at regular intervals. Oculoplast surgeon and paediatric ophthalmologist Dr Milind Changole said his 20-25% patients are suffering from symptoms of computer vision syndrome. “Work from home has triggered the spurt in cases of computer vision syndrome as one’s home is not conducive for such work. We sit facing the air-conditioning machine allowing a strong air current to hit our eyes which is harmful,” he said. Dr Changole offered a unique 20:20:20 formula to save one’s eyes from the detrimental rays of the screen and the bad habits of not blinking. “Every 20 minutes, one must take out 20 seconds to look at something away by at least 20 feet to relax the eye muscles and also avoid the screen,” he said. According to Dr Changole, children are often saved from the detrimental affects of the digital screens as they do not have a sustained attention span and blink more than adults. They may get allergic components overlapping with dryness. Another renowned ophthalmologist Dr Ashish Thool said computer vision syndrome or dry eye syndrome has been triggered by not blinking while using the digital screen leading to non-uniform spread or the tear film in the front part of the eye. “We are prescribing eye drops as tear substitutes. Intermitten blinking is crucial to protect eyes from harming digital screens,” said Dr Thool, adding, untreated or unattended computer eye syndrome or dry eye syndrome may lead to vulnerability of the cornea or infection or various ill-effects of environmental pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/blink-frequently-to-save-eye-from-computer-vision-syndrome-docs/articleshow/87091759.cms||Soumitra Bose

Speaking at a meeting held on Rayalaseema irrigation projects at Hindupur in Anantapur district on Sunday, the TDP legislator recalled that it was his father and former chief minister NT Rama Rao who addressed the perennial irrigation water problems of the Rayalaseema region by taking up the Handri-Neeva project. “But now, it has become clear that the present government has no interest in providing water in this region by formulating appropriate policies. It is time that the Opposition parties, farmers’ unions and people from all walks of life unite to protect the interests of the Rayalaseema region,” the Hindupur legislator added. Elected representatives of the TDP from the four districts of the Rayalaseema region, senior party functionaries and activists were present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/balakrishna-faults-govt-on-water-front/articleshow/87089869.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops arrest 161 immersion rowdies, book 3,000 motorists||KOLKATA: At least 161 people have been arrested along various ghats and water bodies, where Durga Puja immersions are taking place, between Friday and Sunday morning for committing nuisance and resorting to rowdyism. Many of them, said cops, had broken the norms and gathered in large numbers. A few others were caught trying to consume alcohol or play blaring music. As many as 270 persons were prosecuted at 25 ghats for lining up there without any face mask. Around 65 litres of illicit liquor was also seized. “Most of the rowdyism takes place after immersion where rowdies occupy open space near the ghats and even try to consume liquor. We have kept as many as 80 to 135 men ready at big ghats like Baje Kadamtala, Nimtolla and Gwalior to stop all these people from claiming the space. A separate team is keeping their eye on safety of women,” said a senior officer. Another 3,804 motorists and bikers were hauled up and prosecuted for different traffic offences by the police. In all, a total of 60 vehicles were further impounded till Sunday morning starting from last Friday. This is in addition to the 963 two-wheelers impounded between Tritiya and Dashami. Thus, over 1,000 two-wheelers have been seized so far for traffic violations during the festive period. The police said that these raids will continue till Diwali after a sharp rise in traffic violations was noticed during the festive season especially in specific pockets which were comparatively free of pujas. Fifty-eight cases of drunken driving has led cops to launch specific raids that will be scaled up after October 20 when the night restrictions will yet again kick in. “ “The focus is on two-wheelers. Ever since social distancing became the new normal in the city, there has been a rise in use of two-wheelers. There are reports that many new users are not conversant with the laws and were of the belief that cops will not act against them in festive season,” said a Lalbazar officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-arrest-161-immersion-rowdies-book-3k-motorists/articleshow/87091751.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ahmedabad||Breaking Bad in secret GIDC labs||AHMEDABAD: To evade state and central agencies and police, the drug mafia have adopted a new modus operandi — they bring in ingredients separately and process them at GIDC facilities to make synthetic drugs. So the estates of GIDC (Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation) are now under the scanner. Sources in police and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) said that such secret labs produce synthetic drugs like methamphetamine (MD) using, among other ingredients, pseudoephedrine. “We have been keeping a close watch on several GIDC units in Ahmedabad. We got an input that drugs are being manufactured according to demand,” said an NCB officer. The officer said that the drug mafia have been sourcing various ingredients locally. “They do not import the ingredients nor do they bring them from other states,” the officer said. “So the agencies and cops did not get a whiff of the drug racket.” A drug peddler from the Bapunagar area said that unemployed chemists are picked to manufacture the synthetic drugs. “We have several chemists who either work in laboratories or at manufacturing units,” the peddler said. “They can even work from home, giving instructions to our workers who then manufacture drugs like MD in labs.” He said that small players in the drug trade hire premises under the pretext of manufacturing pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. “Earlier, the drugs used to be brought in from Mumbai but later the production began in Ahmedabad,” the peddler said. In August this year, the NCB had busted an MD manufacturing lab in the Vapi town of Valsad and had seized 4.5kg of the drug worth Rs 85 lakh. Since then, surveillance has been maintained over GIDC estates in the city but the agencies are yet to collect concrete evidence to book the drug manufacturers. “These drug mafia work very rapidly. They follow the demand-and-supply principle,” said another NCB officer. “As and when a stock is made, they distribute it very swiftly. So drug caches which can be used as evidence is hard to come by. That’s why these players are still operating.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/breaking-bad-in-secret-gidc-labs/articleshow/87089908.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Vainguinim Valley Residents’ Association (VVRA) and other individuals had complained to GCZMA against the construction of the wall, stating that it was built by the hotel with the intention of usurping a public beach area. While the hotel had maintained that they had only tried to carry out repairs to the anti-erosion structure with approvals from GCZMA and other authorities, citizens alleged construction was completely one and not in line with the approvals granted for repair. GCZMA, at its recent meeting, deliberated on the inspection reports and the submissions from the hotel and citizens. It concluded that the hotel had carried out changes to the structure in line with the plans approved by the water resources department. The authority said that the additional collector-I, North Goa, carried out an inspection on July 28 and stated that the linear wall falls within the survey number and there has been no encroachment. “The objection raised by Flaviano Miranda, expert member of GCZMA, does not hold good as the authority had verified all WRD reports,” GCZMA stated. “As regards the allegation that the alleged construction has taken place in no development zone , the authority finds there is no substance in the said allegations as the inquiry committee appointed by GCZMA has already held in June 7, 2007, that the linear wall had existed prior to 1991,” GCZMA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vainguinim-wall-gczma-withdraws-show-cause-to-hotel/articleshow/87093926.cms||---
---||Kolkata||More clubs take wash-&-melt route for immersion||Kolkata: Bio-immersion is catching up and more pandals are going for the wash-and-melt way, sparing the Hooghly of pollution. Garia’s Pancha Durga was immersed on Sunday at an artificial lake dug up in front of the pandal. The localized “immersion” also prevented large-scale mingling that a procession leading to the river would inevitably cause. Last year, Tridhara Sammilani Club in south Kolkata had shown the way by washing away the idol at a makeshift water body next to the pandal. While Tridhara repeated the practice on Dashami, organizers of Garia Pancha Durga conducted their environment-friendly “immersion” at Mitali Maath near Kavi Nazrul Metro station. Water was sprayed using huge hose pipes, borrowed from fire brigade tenders, from atop the idols till all the “pancha” (five) idols melted away. People have been thronging for a glimpse of the five Durgas at this puja. They came to watch Sunday’s green “immersion”, too. Once an idol’s outer clay and colour washed off and the inner frame became partially visible, the same water was recycled to wash the next one. When the process was completed in about two hours, the frames were taken out and dumped. “The 70ft by 25ft water body was carved out to allow visitors to maintain social distancing when they came to see the pandal. But its best use was the immersion,” said Rubel Chowdhury, one of the organizers. Peerless Hospital clinical research director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick saw the initiative online and appreciated it. Tridhara’s organizer and Trinamool MLA Debashish Kumar, who is also in charge of KMC’s immersion proceedings, said, “The Hooghly is Bengal’s lifeline. We must protect it from lead and other chemicals present in the idols.” To raise awareness for bio-immersion, Tridhara created a special atmosphere. As the idol was being washed on Friday, Rashid Khan’s music was played in the background.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-clubs-take-wash-melt-route-for-immersion/articleshow/87091825.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolhapur||Sugar mills announce 1-time FRP payment, experts unsure||KOLHAPUR: As most of the sugar mills across Kolhapur district are announcing to pay farmers for sugar cane as per fair and remunerative price (FRP) in one go, the industry experts believe that only the mills with a strong balance sheet are in a position to do so. The rest of the mills will have to adopt other measures such as deferring the salaries and other payments if they want to pay an amount equal to FRP in one go. Vijay Autade, a sugar industry expert, said, “The mills get a loan of up to 85% of the price of sugar produced by them from the banks. At present, the minimum support price of sugar is Rs 31 per kg, and since the market is bullish, the price has increased to Rs 34 per kg, based on which, the loans will be sanctioned to the mills. This means, most mills will get Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,100 per quintal, while they are announcing a price in the similar range for per tonne of sugar cane.”  “The mills also have to spend Rs 500 to Rs 600 per tonne to pay the earlier loans, maintenance costs, operating costs and most importantly, for cutting and transportation of sugar cane. In such a scenario, ideally, the mills will only have around Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,400 per tonne left to pay the farmers. Hence, I think all the mills can't pay equal FRP to farmers that too in a single instalment,” he said. After Shahu Sugar Factory announced to pay a price equal to FRP in a single instalment, most mills in the district are making similar announcements. The experts believe that the announcements are being made to gain political mileage owing to upcoming Zilla Parishad and cooperative institutions’ elections. The leaders, who control the mills, try to make the farmers, who are potential voters, happy. “The support price for sugar should be increased so that the smaller mills can balance the economics. Many farmers have not paid salaries to their staff for long, while in some cases even farmers have not been paid,” added Autade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sugar-mills-announce-1-time-frp-payment-experts-unsure/articleshow/87091815.cms||---
---||Kolkata||After Puja, Durga idols set to get new homes at steel plant, GPO in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The Durga Puja may be over this year with majority of organisers concluding idol immersions by Sunday but a handful of idols that had become the talk of the town will be preserved at different locations where people can still admire the artwork at leisure. On Sunday, Barisha Club in Behala which had hit headlines by depicting idols of Goddess Durga and her children as refugees uprooted from their homes and left stranded at the Indo-Bangla border as politicians debated the status of her citizenship, shipped the idols from the club premises to Salboni in West Midnapore. It will be installed at the JSW cement plant after Lakshmi Puja. The idols whose faces depict myriad expression — loss, bewilderment, pain and even simmering anger — have received critical acclaim from people in India and abroad and has been one of the most shared images of Maa Durga on the social media. It was JSW Foundation chairperson Sangita Jindal who approached artist Rintu Das and the club authorities and sought permission to preserve the idols for posterity. This is the third year in a row that Barisha Club’s idols are being preserved. A wooden Durga carved out of a single log in 2019 is on display at the Eco Park in Rajarhat. Last year’s idols that depicted Durga and her children as migrant labourers are also showcased in front of Alia University in New Town. “This year’s Durga with the theme ‘Bhaager Maa’ (The mother, divided) was based around the subject of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and reflects the pain of being uprooted a second time after having had to leave home once when the Partition happened,” said a club official. Aurobindo Setu Sarbojonin Durgotsab in north Kolkata had themed their pandal as a post office and the Durga idol with her children were inscribed in a large structure depicting a postal stamp. The pandal decorated with replicas of several hundred rare and old postal stamps, rare letters, had gone viral on social media and had grabbed the attention of the post master general of India who proposed the organisers to not immerse the idol but preserve it at the GPO in Kolkata. “The post master general of India’s office contacted us and during the Puja days senior postal representatives visited our pandal and were amused by the theme, décor and the idol. Acknowledging our work, the authorities had even set up a postal camp here on our premises on Ashtami and on Navami evening. We received the official mail where they proposed to preserve our Durga idol beside the famous Runner statue at the GPO in Kolkata,” said Mintu Patra, a senior member of the club. The idol at Hindusthan Club in Gariahat will be preserved at “Maa Fire Elo” museum in Rabindra Sarobar. “It’s a great honour to be among the few selected,” said Saurav Basu, a club functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-puja-durga-idols-set-to-get-new-homes-at-steel-plant-gpo/articleshow/87091801.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Lucknow||What it takes to be a war correspondent? Veteran explains||Lucknow: “We do not have enough correspondents to keep the stories alive. We need to put enough resources in news gathering,” said Ajay Shukla, a retired army colonel turned journalist. The war correspondent, along with journalist Abhijeet Dasgupta, was among the panelists for the ninth session titled ‘War Correspondent’ of the Lucknow Military Literature Festival on Sunday. Editor Sanjay Kapoor moderated the session. Known for his reporting from several war zones and his contribution in the battlefield himself, Shukla shared some anecdotes from war zones in Afghanistan (November 2001), Iraq (2003) and Lebanon (2006). Speaking on why he chose journalism after retiring from the Indian Army, he said, “Quite a few journalists regard the Kargil War as an important peak of their reporting. However, back then, most journalists who came to report the war had knowledge deficit. A journalist, who is reporting from a war zone, should know the nitty-gritty of it. When I retired, I wanted to be on the ground, right where the action takes place, and especially stay in touch with the military.” “Defence journalists, while reporting from areas of conflict, need to rely on a good degree of luck, along with spatial awareness. That is how you’ll be safe,” he added. Abhijit Dasgupta (78) was the youngest war correspondent to enter East Pakistan in March1971, during the Bangladesh’s Liberation War. He made 10 forays, was friendly with politician and founding father of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rehaman’s son Sheikh Kamal (who was also his source in gathering information for his correspondence there), and later covered the war that followed. Through a series of annotated photos he took the audience to the conflict and war zones. The killings, rapes, destruction by the Pakistan Army and the resilience of the Bengali people, the jubilation after the Independence, the air and the land war, was brilliantly depicted in the audio-visual presentation shared by Dasgupta during the session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/what-it-takes-to-be-a-war-correspondent-veteran-explains/articleshow/87093965.cms||Aditi Singh

While her husband and in-laws said that the woman, Bhavika Baldaniya, died after feeling uneasy and having chest pain, her mother and their community members alleged that she was tortured and beaten after which she died. Gondal police have, however, made an entry in their station diary that she was brought unconscious to hospital after she hanged herself. Baldaniya married Chirag around three months ago. Police said that Baldaniya was brought to Gondal hospital unconscious and declared dead before admission. Later, her husband Chirag informed her mother that she was feeling uneasy and had chest pain due to which she became unconscious and rushed to hospital. When Baldaniya’s mother, who lives in Rajkot, reached Gondal along with community members, she alleged that her daughter was tortured and killed by the in-laws. “The forensic postmortem was done in Rajkot on Sunday. The report will reveal the truth whether she was harassed by in-laws,” said Dilip Aswani, one of the community members who is also a former councillor. Police have registered a case of accidental death and register an offence if the postmortem report reveals anything suspicious. On Sunday, Baldaniya’s mother refused to accept her body demanding an offence be registered against Chirag, his mother Meena and brother Hritik. She told cops that on Saturday evening when she talked with Baldaniya, she seemed fine. She also alleged that Baldaniya used to be harassed over doing household chores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mystery-shrouds-death-of-20-year-old-married-woman/articleshow/87089829.cms||---

The Ichalkaranji police officials have arrested the main accused Shubham Kane and six others. The deceased Santosh Shrikant Jadhav owned a restaurant at Station Road. The suspect had visited the restaurant and was involved in a brawl with a hotel staff member. Following this, the accused intervened and warned Kane to stay away from the locality. The police officials have recovered a blood-stained sword from the crime scene. The accused also tried to smash the deceased’s head with a stone. The deceased had marks on his head and other body parts. He was profusely bleeding, while on the way to the private hospital. The doctors declared him dead on arrival. Baburao Mahamuni, deputy superintendent of police said, the reason behind the murder is a rivalry between Jadhav and Kane which began during the Ganesh festival after a minor brawl took place between the two and a bailable case was registered. The police have registered a crime of murder against 7 persons, including Kane as a main accused. The search for one accused is underway. The police have deployed teams to search for the accused at several locations. Superintendent of Police Shailesh Balkawade visited the town and asked the local cops to speed up the investigation and arrest all the accused.

Interrogation of accused Dixit revealed that he was staying with Heena in Ahmedabad for the last couple of years. Dixit’s wife and other family members stay in Gandhinagar.  “Heena had been insisting to shift out of Ahmedabad for the last few months. She used to tell Dixit that she isn’t able to manage the child alone and wants to shift to some other city with him so that he can spend more time with her and their child,” said an official. When Heena was in Ahmedabad, Dixit used to visit her frequently under the pretext of professional visits.  “On her insistence, Dixit mailed to his company seeking transfer to some other city. He was given transfer to Vadodara following which he shifted here with Heena. For the first 10 days they stayed in PG and then took a flat on rent in Khodiyarnagar,” the police added.  Investigating officials said that after murdering Heena, Dixit didn’t make much effort to dispose her body somewhere. “He hid the body in a suitcase in the flat’s kitchen. Dixit told us that he knew that the cops will someday reach him,” the police added. Dixit will now be taken to Ahmedabad where he used to stay with Heena for further investigations.  Dixit had murdered Heena some days ago after a heated argument with her. Heena didn’t want him to travel with his wife to Uttar Pradesh and that led to a fight between the duo. Dixit strangulated her to death and then abandoned their one-year-old child at a gaushala in Gandhinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/heena-murder-dixit-shifted-to-vadodara-on-the-insistence-of-his-live-in-partner/articleshow/87089659.cms||---
---||Lucknow||A woman & Ayodhya’s booming real estate biz behind shooting at Durga Puja pandal||Ayodhya: Four days after a man was shot from point-blank range during Durga puja celebrations at Korkhana Neel Godam area of Ayodhya, four gunmen who stormed the puja pandal and went on a shooting spree were arrested. While Manjeet Yadav, 32, died on the spot, his two sisters are battling for life at Trauma Centre, Lucknow. While 14 persons who came in three SUVs were involved in the plot, the kingpin and his three aides were nabbed on Sunday, said police. The immediate trigger for the murder was an ego tussle between Manjeet and key accused Diwakar Singh over a woman, who worked at a posh restaurant owned by Singh on Lucknow-Faizabad highway. “Just days before Singh and his gun-wielding henchmen ran amok, he was driving the woman home on his bike. It was a daily practice, but on Wednesday when he hit a roadblock in the Yadav-dominated area, he ordered the clearance of parked vehicles. When the youths refused to budge and poked fun at the woman pillion rider, sparks flew. And Singh vowed to exact revenge,” Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey told TOI. However, the FIR lodged by Manjeet Yadav’s family members attributed the murder to a real estate dispute. But police sources said, Singh’s feudal mindset, his domineering attitude and desire to control the booming real estate business in Ayodhya was a cause of sporadic friction with Yadavs. Besides Diwakar Singh, 31, his accomplices Sudhakar Singh, Upendra Singh and Ritesh Singh were paraded before the media on Sunday. A licensed pistol and cartridges used in the murder and the SUV used in the crime have been seized, the SSP said. The accused will be produced in court on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/a-woman-ayodhyas-booming-real-estate-biz-behind-shooting-at-durga-puja-pandal/articleshow/87093932.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The incident took place on January 5, 2021 when 15 persons entered the victims’ house at Bowenpally by impersonating as income tax (IT) employees and conductiong a raid. Later, the three victims, K Praveen Kumar, K Naveen Kumar and K Sunil Kumar, were kidnapped and forcefully taken into a car before they were let off at Kokapet. As supportive evidence to prove the case, police are relying on the CCTV footages, call data records, eye witnesses and forensic reports before filing the chargesheet. Ever since Akhila Priya was arrested and later released on bail, all the accused in the case have been appearing before the police as per the bail condition laid down by the court. However, the former AP minister has sought exemption to appear before the police on medical grounds. Bhargav Ram, who is facing an additional criminal case of submitting an alleged fake Covid-19 report, has been coming to Bowenpally police station regularly as per the conditions laid down by the court while granting him bail. “A total of 30 persons were declared as accused in the kidnap-cum-extortion case. The chargesheet will be finalised soon,” sources in Hyderabad police told TOI. The Hafeezpet land dispute between the victims and Akhila Priya’s family is said to be the main reason that has led to the kidnap-cum- extortion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-to-file-chargesheet-against-akhila-priya-29-others-soon/articleshow/87091881.cms||Srinath Vudali

One or two spells of thundershowers may occur on Monday as well. The rainfall activity is expected to decline from Tuesday, but weather will remain cloudy with possibility of light showers till Thursday. The situation will be normal by Friday.  People run for cover during rain on SundaySunday rainfall was scattered and the intensity varied from one place to another. While the main city areas recorded 30-40mm rains during the two-hour downpour, rainfall was less on the outskirts. The observatory at the state Met office in Amausi recorded only 3mm rainfall. Owing to choked drains, many areas remained submerged in ankle-to-knee-deep water for 3-4 hours after rains. The strong winds measuring upto 30-40km per hour uprooted trees and billboards in some areas and disrupted power supply. Lucknow doesn’t usually get heavy rains in October and the normal rainfall for the month is 44.8mm. However, a cyclonic circulation over Afghanistan and a low pressure area stretching from over Telangana to west UP led to moderate to heavy rainfall in many parts of the state. Rainfall was more extensive in western UP in comparison to the central and the eastern parts. State Met director JP Gupta said moderate to heavy rainfall may occur in Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Badaun, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Sambhal, Lakhimpur Kheri, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Saharanpur, Shamlu, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Hathras, Etah, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Mainpuri, Amroha, Harodi, Agra, Hampipur and adjoining areas on Monday. Air quality improvesRains brought air pollution levels down from ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category in the city on Sunday. Lucknow’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was 114, around 100 units lesser in comparison to 222 and 212 on Friday and Saturday, respectively. Experts said pollutants in the air were washed away by rains and strong winds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rain-pours-relief-but-drainage-woes-spill-over/articleshow/87093996.cms||---

After very meticulous considerations, I have decided to throw my hat in the political ring,” Rodrigues said. He added that he will set up committees for all the booths in the state capital and will personally reach out to every household in the constituency for support and advice. This is not the first time that the social activist has announced his intention to contest the elections. Rodrigues, who is a bitter critic of the BJP regime and Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, said he is well versed in the functioning of the government.  Rodrigues had contested from St Andre constituency in 1984, where he polled 900 odd votes. In 2014, the lawyer had made a similar attempt to contest the elections from Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aires-plans-to-contest-polls-from-panaji/articleshow/87094038.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Long viral fever baffles doctors, many patients end up in ICU||HYDERABAD: Doctors in the city are baffled as patients with viral fever are landing in intensive care unit (ICU), a never-seen-before scenario. The recovery time taken for most viral and vector-borne diseases has increased by 2 to 5 days as well, increasing hospital visits and use of antibiotics to treat viral fevers and hospitalizations. While doctors struggle to understand the exact reason behind the development, they indicate that it could be due to a different reaction to the viruses after a long period of staying at home and away from viruses, seasonal changes, dip in general immunity levels or a possible change in strains. “Earlier, viral fevers used to last for 1 to 2 days and then people would recover on their own. We used to see patients coming with high grade fever and testing dengue positive but now these cases are testing negative for dengue, malaria and still not recovering for 4 for 5 days. The recovery is not only slow but also after recovering they are becoming weak and dehydrated in case of all kinds of viral fevers, many a times requiring admission. Also, influenza and dengue patients are taking longer than earlier to recover. In dengue there is a possibility of a different strain,” said Dr Sowmya Bondalpati, consultant general physician, Continental Hospitals, adding that nearly 30% of the cases are now requiring hospital admission and use of antibiotics in treating viral fevers has increased. While doctors say the recent rains have led to an increase in cases, over the last one month, the reasons could also be increase in mosquitoes to weather change to suppressed immunity. “It is possible that after longer periods of staying inside their homes and eating healthy food, now that people are venturing out more there could be higher exposure to viruses and they have started to respond to the viruses differently. The average recovery time has gone up by 3 to 5 days in cases of viral fevers and dengue fevers,” said Dr Parag Shankarrao Dekate, clinical director, paediatrics and head of pediatric intensive care, KIMS Cuddles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/long-viral-fever-baffles-docs-many-patients-end-up-in-icu/articleshow/87091862.cms||Amrita Didyala

This has been the schedule of a number of Kolkata professionals, working in other cities, who could enjoy the Puja in their home town this time after many years due to the work-from-home schedule that helped them balance work with festivities. “Usually, we either have to spend the Puja sulking at workplaces away from home or take leaves to come back to Kolkata, spend the Puja and again rush back to work. But that has not been the case this time. This year, I have spent one of the most relaxing Pujas ever working at home on Puja days while planning celebrations and enjoying the evenings with friends and family members. That’s the best part of work from home,” said Shaoni Chowdhury, a senior project manager with Gurgaon office of HP Worldwide Studio. Chowdhury is in Kolkata since December last year. Similar has been the schedule of Soumya Mukherjee, a techie with an MNC in Bangalore who celebrated the Puja with his family and friends for the first time in six years. “I have been working from home since last year but didn’t dare to fly to Kolkata last year with my two-year-old son due to the pandemic. But this year, with all of us together in the city, I handled my work commitments in the morning and afternoon and celebrated the whole evening and night with my family and friends,” said Mukherjee, who lives in a south Kolkata complex. Consultant Rahul Roy and his wife Sohini, a project coordinator with a public research university in Mumbai, also thanked the work-from-home schedule that didn’t require them to save and take the leaves during Durga Puja. “I never miss Kolkata’s Puja but getting two weeks’ leave means I have to let go of minor casual and earned leaves and even some long vacations through the year to manage this Puja holiday. But this year, none of us had to seek leaves. We worked and enjoyed the Puja at the same time. Even some of my old friends, who work abroad, also visited Kolkata this year to celebrate the Puja while working on their laptops even from pandals and during our home parties,” said Roy, who works at a global consultancy firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/thanks-to-wfh-professionals-celebrate-durga-puja-at-home/articleshow/87091879.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Party founder and national president Mukesh Sahni on Sunday addressed two such rallies in Ambedkarnagar and Azamgarh. Demanding reservation for the community, Sahni said that if the state government fails to grant reservation it will become difficult for it to win the 2022 state assembly election. “There are at least 12.9% Nishads in the state but they have been treated like second grade citizens,” he said. State president Chaudhary Lautan Ram Nishad said that Nishad vote will decide the outcome of the upcoming elections in UP. “The party’s decision regarding alliance with other parties will depend on the state government’s decision to grant SC status to the Nishads,” he said. In more than 30 districts of the state including most of the Purvanchal districts, there are more than 40,000 Nishad votes in one or more than one Vidhan Sabha region.

The KMC authorities have claimed that over 800 bins have been removed — mostly from the residential areas. Most of the times the waste lies in the bins for several days, leading to filth and pungent odour in nearby localities. Therefore, the decision was taken to get rid of the bins and ensure door-to-door collection on a daily basis. Kadambari Balkawade, civic administrator, said, “Around 200 bins will be kept in vegetable markets, major chowks and other congested areas. At these places, the plan is to collect the bin and empty them at the dumping yard every day as they get filled immediately. The staff on the ground has been asked to visit the places from where the bins have been removed and inform the residents about daily door-to-door collection of garbage through collection vans. Citizens, however, will have to ensure segregation of waste.” The lack of garbage segregation causes trouble at the processing site. “We will activate a phone number on which the residents can upload photos of garbage heaps they encounter in any part of the city. We will ensure the heap is removed immediately and also take necessary steps so that the residents do not have to throw the waste in open,” Balkawade said. The city generates around 180 to 200 tonne of solid waste every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/garbage-bins-to-stay-at-markets-congested-places-kmc/articleshow/87088396.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath invokes Maharaja Suheldev, lauds MLAs for development||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had a word of praise for the role played by elective representatives of Bahraich and Shravasti in implementing various projects of the Centre and state government. He attributed their concerted efforts to the success of flagship schemes in the twin aspirational districts. Yogi was speaking at the virtual inauguration and foundation-laying ceremonies of 231 development projects of Rs 611 crores in Bahraich and Shravasti districts on Sunday. This included 144 projects of Rs 221 crore in Bahraich and 87 projects of over Rs 390 crore in Shravasti. The CM was scheduled to reach the two districts in the afternoon, but had to return after his chopper failed to touchdown due to inclement weather. Invoking Maharaja Suheldev who defeated and killed the Ghaznavid general Ghazi Miyan at Bahraich in 1034, the chief minister reiterated that a grand memorial in his name of 11th century king in Bahraich was being constructed on a war footing to catapult the district into a new tourist hub in coming days. The project, which was kicked off in February, is being seen as BJP’s aggressive outreach to consolidate Rajbhar community, which has a sizable presence in east UP. This also gains significance with the saffron outfit countering an aggressive SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has been threatening to sabotage the BJP’s prospects in assembly elections. The CM said, a medical college in the name of Maharaja Suhelldev, which got started two years ago, has provided relief to people during the pandemic. Yogi said, he wanted to establish a dialogue with party workers and people while dedicating the projects. Under PMAY scheme, Bahraich got more than 1,36,000 housing units in rural areas and over 8,400 units have been allotted in urban areas. Likewise, over 4lakh toilets have been constructed in the district.

Six-time SP MLA Narendra Verma filed his nomination papers for the post of deputy speaker on Sunday. Chaudhary, who accompanied Verma for the nomination along with many senior politicians, said, “As per the tradition, deputy speaker is chosen from the principal opposition party and the party in power does not oppose it. But the BJP has gone against the age-old tradition,” he told TOI. Chaudhary said BJP held no meeting with the opposition parties or moved a proposal for the election of the deputy speaker for the past 4.5 years. “Suddenly, BJP announced the election and nominated Nitin Agarwal as its candidate. We wanted to give this post to someone from the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe or the other backward classes. Now we will see on the election day if the BJP lives up to the set traditions or not,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-has-broken-parliamentary-tradition-in-dy-speaker-poll-sp/articleshow/87094093.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Residents say that despite complaints to the officials, the garbage has not been lifted and the drains are still overflowing. Similarly, the Himmatpura, Alijah Kotla, Shahalibanda and Khilwat areas have turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes and stray animals. Due to this, the residents and commuters are facing difficulties. Apart from this, increasing cases of viral fever and dengue have added to the residents’ woes. Locals complain that the unhealthy environment is affecting the health of children and elderly people. An Old City resident, Mohammed Anwar, told TOI that the official apapthy despite several complaints is affecting residents’ health. “The government has announced Sunday-Funday-like event at Charminar but the authorities should once visit the localities and see how the people are forced to live in this filthy atmosphere. Owing to this, children’s and elders’ health is being affected,” Anwar told TOI. Highlighting the prevailing unhealthy atmosphere and the authorities’ negligence, Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) has urged the GHMC commissioner and mayor to look into the matter. “The residents of Himmatpura face lots of problems as the piles of garbage have turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes and stray animals. The matter was taken up with officials but nothing has been done,” Mohammed Ahmed, GHMC, minority vice-president, TTDP told TOI. Surya Kumar, deputy commissioner, GHMC, Charminar said that as it is the festive season many employees were absent and that the problem would be addressed soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/filth-offical-apathy-irk-old-city-residents/articleshow/87091995.cms||---

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is also trying to provide free high-speed internet connectivity inside all metro trains. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communication) of DMRC, said that the Wi-Fi service has been launched on all 37 stations of the Yellow Line (Huda City Centre-Samaypur Badli) from Sunday. The corridor — DMRC’s busiest — runs mostly underground through one of the most congested parts of Delhi covering outer Delhi, north Delhi through central Delhi and south Delhi and finally Gurugram. “More than 330 access points have been installed at these 37 stations to provide uninterrupted internet access to the commuters. This high-speed free Wi-Fi service will prove to be a boon to students travelling to and from North Campus of Delhi University,” Dayal said.  To access the service, users have to select “OUI DMRC FREE WIFI” on their phone, enter their phone number and email ID to get OTP by SMS and then enter the OTP, accept terms conditions and tap the connect button. “OUI DMRC free high-speed Wi-Fi connectivity is already available on all stations of Blue Line and Airport Express Line,” he added. Blue Line (Dwarka-Noida Electronic City/Vaishali) consists of 50 metro stations, where over 400 access points have been placed by DMRC to provide uninterpreted internet access, he said.

---||Hyderabad||CO2 emissions from paddy crop in Telangana 2.5L tonnes: PJTSAU||HYDERABAD: Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University’s (PJTSAU) recent study on dangerous emissions from paddy cultivation says that CO2 equivalent to paddy fields from Telangana is only 2.5 lakh tonnes but not in crore tonnes. The university also said that rice cultivation has its own benefits like increasing the organic carbon in the soil. “For example, the typical emissions from a passenger vehicle are 120 gm/km. Using an average monthly travel distance of 200 km for each car, it is 24 kg per month and 288 kg per year. Even if we assume that each passenger vehicle emits 250 kg of CO2 per year, the total number of vehicles in Telangana that emit CO2 comparable to paddy fields should be 2.5 lakh tonnes,” university vice-chancellor Dr Pravin Rao told TOI. Furthermore, Dr Rao said some aspects have to be necessarily taken into consideration while computing overall CO2 emissions. “Through photosynthesis, the rice plant also absorbs CO2 from the environment. The degradation of biomass adds organic carbon to the soil. Algal blooms in rice fields also collect a certain amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” he said. He observed that that long-term ponding of water in paddy cultivation helps to a large extent in groundwater recharge. This is an ecosystem advantage in paddy cultivation that was not previously acknowledged. Without understanding these factors, emissions approach used appears to be inappropriate,” he pointed out. According to him, India is among the very few countries that are meeting the international treaty-mandated carbon emissions objective. “The recent Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also made these remarks, and unlike many advanced countries, India and especially Telangana are performing considerably better in this regard,” he said. The paddy cultivation does not pose any threat at the current level, he assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/co2-emissions-from-paddy-crop-in-t-2-5l-tonnes-pjtsau/articleshow/87091972.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh home to maximum malnourished kids under BJP rule: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Attacking the BJP over India’s poor performance on the world hunger index, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said UP has the most number of malnourished children in the country. The former CM said UP now wants a “yogya” (efficient) instead of “Yogi” government. The SP chief gave this statement while addressing the media at the party headquarters in Lucknow where he welcomed former BSP state president and ex-MLA RS Kushwaha, former BSP MLA Qadir Rana and president of the state employees’ unions Engineer Hari Kishore Tewari into the SP fold along with their thousands of supporters. In their address, the two former BSP leaders accused Mayawati of deviating from the core ideology of the party. Akhilesh attacked the BJP for rising prices of essential commodities which, he said, was making it difficult for people to have two square meals a day for themselves and their family. The SP chief said when the BJP government at the Centre talks of making India a $5 trillion economy, the BJP government in the state talks of achieving $1 trillion economy for Uttar Pradesh. “But the prices of essential commodities like food and fuel have risen so sharply that people are forced to sleep hungry. The statistics of the global hunger index have put India behind countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. India has the maximum number of underweight children and UP has the most malnourished children,” Akhilesh said, adding: “This is the state of affairs when the BJP governments are promising trillion-dollar economies. This proves that the BJP government is not on the right path.” The former UP CM questioned government claims of record distribution of free wheat and rice to the poor through various schemes of the Centre and the state, adding that the global hunger index statistics say our children are underweight and malnourished. “During the SP regime we had introduced milk and fruits in mid-day meals. Food packets distributed in Bundelkhand and other parts of the state had 1kg ghee and 1kg milk-powder for the children,” he said. He accused the government of not only depriving the children of quality food but also destroying the education system as well. “Now UP needs a yogya (efficient) government and not Yogi government,” he said. Also attacking the BJP governments over growing unemployment, Akhilesh said, “The BJP had promised 1 crore jobs. Let the government put out the list of one crore youths who have been given these jobs.” “The government claimed it was buying power at the rate of Rs 17 per unit. If that is the case then who has benefited? The government at the Centre? Haven’t the people voted for the government at the Centre,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-home-to-max-malnourished-kids-under-bjp-rule-akhilesh/articleshow/87094114.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Goa||Goa: Court denies bail in drugs case, cites technicality||PANAJI: A Mapusa court has rejected the bail application of an accused in a narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances (NDPS) case and held that it is not permissible to separate the weight of the papers on which solution or drops of LSD are dried from the drug in its pure form. “In this case, the prima facie material shows that the weight of the 37 square papers seized from the accused was 0.71g, which is much more than the specified weight of 0.1g constituting commercial quantity in the table appended to the NDPS Act. What necessarily follows is that the rigours of Section 37 of the NDPS Act establishes that the accused is not entitled for bail,” ad hoc additional sessions judge Bosco G F Roberts said. The accused was arrested at Anjuna in March this year and was caught with 37 perforated papers and two square papers weighing 0.71g suspected to be LSD worth Rs 1.8 lakh. The contraband was forwarded to the CFSL, Pune, Maharashtra for a chemical analyser’s report. Public prosecutor Ralston Barreto submitted that the police do not have the means to segregate the LSD drug from the weight of the paper. The court directed the investigating officer to expedite the return of the chemical analyser’s report. Advocate Michael Nazareth, on behalf of the accused, stated that it is unfair to keep the accused in custody till the report is received and that the accused be released on interim bail. Barreto submitted that the samples were already sent for testing as per the chargesheet in July 2021and the report will be received shortly. He added that it is now settled by the high court of Bombay at Goa that a chargesheet can be filed and charges framed against the accused on the basis of a field test report and pending receipt of the chemical analysis.

---||Lucknow||We followed parliamentary norms by backing SP MLA for deputy speaker post: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that the BJP was "following parliamentary traditions" by supporting SP MLA Nitin Agarwal for the post of deputy speaker for the UP assembly. Yogi made the statement while accompanying Agarwal during filing of his nomination papers in the assembly. BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh and cabinet ministers, Brijesh Pathak and Suresh Khanna, were also present on the occasion. Nitin happens to be the son of SP turncoat and former RS member Naresh Agarwal who switched over to the saffron camp in March 2018 after SP did not nominate him again to the upper house of parliament and instead chose cine-star-turned politician Jaya Bachchan. ‘Contest also marks BJP’s attempt to consolidate traders’While Nitin technically happens to be with the SP, he has been openly hobnobbing with the BJP without being expelled from the SP. On Sunday, SP's another MLA Narendra Verma also filed his nomination for the deputy speaker’s post, in what has triggered a "SP versus SP" electoral contest due on Monday. Yogi maintained that SP, which is the principal opposition party was not able to announce its candidate on time which is why the BJP decided to support the candidature of Nitin. “We are respecting parliamentary traditions,” he asserted. Given the strength of the BJP in the UP assembly -- 304 seats -- Nitin will have a cake walk over Verma. The contest also marks BJP's attempt to consolidate the trader community ahead of the crucial UP polls due in the next few months. The SP has fielded Verma, a Kurmi, in what is seen as a deft move to whip up the OBC card to counter the BJP. There have been only 17 deputy speakers till date in the UP assembly. On many occasions, the entire term of the assembly got completed without a deputy speaker. BJP's Rajesh Agrawal (currently BJP National Treasurer) was the last deputy speaker of the UP assembly — his term lasted till May 2007.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-we-followed-parliamentary-norms-bybacking-sp-mla-for-deputy-speaker-post/articleshow/87094141.cms||---

The disclosure -- perhaps for the first time -- came while he was addressing party workers during Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan, a programme initiated by the BJP to reach out to the OBC community ahead of the UP polls. “We would not let the power crisis spoil the festivities in any of the districts," Yogi declared, maintaining that on normal days the same power was purchased at Rs 7 per unit.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt to give Rs 50,000 aid to kin of Covid victims since March 2021||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday announced Rs 50,000 assistance to next of kin of those who died of Covid-19 since the onset of pandemic in March last year. This, government representatives told TOI, includes deaths at home and in hospitals. The directive comes almost a year after Supreme Court asked the Centre to hammer out a compensation strategy for families of those who succumbed to the virus. Later, the apex court approved the Rs 50,000 ex-gratia package suggested by the Centre. As per official data until Sunday, 22,898 people in UP died of Covid since March 2020 with the highest toll in Lucknow at 2,651. The state government’s directive followed a meeting of Team 9 chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who sought detailed guidelines for disbursement of aid. A district committee under the district magistrate in 75 districts will be constituted to check eligibility and dole out relief. “The will be applicable for those who have died of Covid in Uttar Pradesh. The government is already giving compensation to next of kin of healthcare workers, but Sunday’s decision is overarching,” additional chief secretary, information Navneet Sehgal told TOI. “Aid will be given per casualty, even if there are more than one death in a family, which needs to provide proof of deceased having been infected with Covid. This can include an RT-PCR report or any other record of Covid contraction,” Sehgal added. “The budget has been allocated, further guidelines will be drawn up and committees under different district administrations will be formed to take up the cases,” he said. As per apex court directive, funds should be released in 30 days through State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-announces-rs50k-aid-to-kin-of-those-who-died-of-covid-since-pandemic-onset-in-march-2020/articleshow/87094152.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Pay Rs 10 lakh to patient’s kin’||Ahmedabad: A consumer court ordered a doctor from Surat and his hospital to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to the family of a woman who died in childbirth, allegedly due to medical negligence on part of the doctor, as he was not present for most of the time after she was brought to the hospital. The case involves Dr Mukund Patel and Namrata Hospital in Katargam in Surat. The complaint was filed by Kirit Tailor and his three children, stating that Tailor’s wife, Binita (28), was taken to the hospital at 1am on January 25, 2006, when she started having labour pain. The doctor was not present and a hospital staffer attended to her. The staffer called the doctor and he instructed the staffer over the telephone to administer an injection. The family submitted that Binita was taken to the labour room at 7.45am. Her health was good at the time and she walked to the room. In five minutes, her health deteriorated. She gave birth to a boy, but due to her critical condition, she had to be shifted to one Ashaktashram Hospital, where she died at 11.45am. The family first filed a complaint in 2011 with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Surat (additional), which turned down the plaint in 2013. The family approached the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission raising the same contention that it was negligence on the part of the doctor, because he remained absent for most of the time and he claimed to have entered the labour room from the back, but by then the patient’s condition had worsened. The doctor’s defence was that as soon as the patient’s condition deteriorated, he called a physician, an anaesthetist and a child specialist. It was after consultation with these doctors that the patient was referred to another hospital, where the facilities were better. It was due to their efforts that the child was saved. The consumer commission concluded that there was a contradiction in the doctor’s version. “When the patient was healthy before entering in labour room and her condition became critical inside the labour room, then only the doctor only knows what happened in the labour room. But he has not produced any evidence to prove that he was not negligent, and therefore in the opinion of this commission the opponent doctor is liable for the critical condition of the patient and it is the gross medical negligence on the part of the opponent doctor,” the commission noted while asking the doctor to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation with 6% interest from the time the complaint was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pay-rs-10-lakh-to-patients-kin/articleshow/87090089.cms||---

Police said that according to preliminary investigation, study pressure may be the reason behind the extreme step. Cops received a call at PCR from a nursing home in Ashok Nagar regarding a girl who was declared brought dead. “On inquiry, it was found that the deceased was a student who was studying in class XII,” an officer said. “Further probe revealed that a small diary contained a suicide note,” deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said. Police have also recovered two clothes. “According to the suicide note, the cause of death seems to be study pressure, which the girl was unable to bear,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/17-yr-old-dies-by-suicide-pressure-of-studies-may-be-to-blame/articleshow/87092078.cms||---
---||Delhi||How cutting Delhi-NCR to size by a third may put the focus back on planned growth||NEW DELHI: The overall area of the National Capital Region (NCR) is likely to reduce by a third – from the current 55,144 sq km to 37,115 sq km – as the four member states are on board for its "compact development". But this fresh move, primarily pushed by Haryana, has kicked off a debate on whether the planning and development of NCR in the recent decades has met the objective of planned decentralisation of development outside Delhi. Sources said the four states – Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan – had agreed that a fresh delineation of NCR should be based on three parameters: the contiguous region in a 100km radius from Rajghat should be a part of NCR as also the tehsils with 50% or more area within this radius; also, beyond this 100km radius and up to the current NCR boundary, all notified cities and towns along with a corridor of 1km on the either side of the expressway, NHs, state highways and the upcoming rapid rail network should be treated as part of NCR. Apart from these, no more districts would be added to the region. Officials said the past clamour for including more districts in NCR was more for "political" reasons than with a view towards its sound planning and development. Official documents show that that the main objective of developing NCR as a planned region was to decongest Delhi. “The need for planned decentralisation to outer areas of Delhi and even outside the capital city was felt long back in 1956 when the Interim General Plan for Delhi was conceptualised. The first master plan of Delhi also emphasised on the need for a regional planning for this,” said a town planner, who has been associated with the regional plans. So far, two regional plans have been notified and a third (RP-2041) is under preparation. Considering that one of the main factors for the increase in population of Delhi in the initial years after Independence was the concentration of Central government offices and PSUs in the capital, there was a focus in the regional plans to create conditions for either shifting of offices from Delhi or opening of new offices outside the capital. Officials admit that there have been mixed results. While hardly any government offices have shifted out of Delhi, there has been a huge increase in corporate offices in the suburbs, such as Noida and Gurgaon, in the recent years. The thrust on bringing more and more government offices in the heart of Delhi also came under criticism in the past two years ever since the Central government unveiled the Central Vista redevelopment plan to bring all ministries and their allied offices along Rajpath. "Could Delhi cope with the population increase due to the mass migration had NCR not been planned and developed? The population study of the region carried out in the past shows how the population increase has been more in the adjoining cities and districts compared with Delhi. Between 2004 and 2005 and 2015 and 2016, there has been a phenomenal increase in the number of housing units, private schools, hospitals and industrial estates in the NCR cities," said a Haryana government official who had been dealing with the planning issues of the region. However, some other urban planners flagged that the achievement so far had been much short of what was envisaged. "The focus should have been more on pushing economic activities, creating high-speed transport networks so that people living in far-off towns (say, 100-150km from Delhi) could commute quickly for work. Even now, when the states want to exclude some of their districts from NCR, they seem more keen on getting rid of regulations rather than going for sound planned development," pointed out an urban planner who did not wish to be named. Even government officials admitted that the inclusion of more areas in NCR was resulting in more restrictions and regulations, which was now impacting the interests of the member states. "For example, the stricter norm for regulating the old vehicles is now for the entire NCR. The states need to ensure that the development plans and master plans of towns falling in the region align with the regional plan since different courts have upheld this provision. The provision of restriction for any non-forest activities in areas falling under the conservation zone as per the regional plan has been a matter of confrontation between the NCR Planning Board and the states. So, now there is a feeling that they are losing more of their authority in areas falling in NCR," an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-cutting-ncr-to-size-by-a-third-may-put-the-focus-back-on-planned-growth/articleshow/87092075.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Kochi||Chilavannoor CRZ violation files untraceable: RTI reply||Kochi: In what can be seen as the callous attitude of authorities, the state information commissioner, in reply to an RTI application, stated that files regarding CRZ violations and encroachments on Chilavannoor backwaters couldn’t be traced four years after submitting the application.  The reply by the top government authorities in Kerala hints that the encroachments on waterbodies and other CRZ violations will not be cleared even while the state faces hardships due to changes in climatic conditions and rain havoc stemming out of the damage caused to the environment. In the reply to an application given by RTI activist K T Cheshire in 2017, the commissioner also asks the applicant to tread other means to get the files. Earlier, Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) also had replied that the files are not available. “Following this, I submitted an application before state information commissioner in 2017. After four years, now the commissioner also says that the files couldn’t be traced,” Cheshire said. “By giving such a reply, the authorities try to protect the officials who gave permissions for constructions violating CRZ norms,” Cheshire said. In its verdict which led to the demolition of four apartment complexes at Maradu for violating CRZ norms in 2019, the Supreme Court had asked the authorities to identity the CRZ violations in Kochi and take measures to evict them. Even after two years since the court issuing the order, encroachments upon the waterbodies and constructions violating CRZ norms are still there. The authorities haven’t taken any effective step against such illegal activities. Environmentalist C R Neelakandan said that the state information commissioner failed in discharging his duties. “It is their responsibility to trace the files and give the copies of it as sought by the applicant. Now, the applicant must seek other legal remedies,” he said. He also said that the move by the RTI authorities in the state will help the officials who issued building permits for illegal constructions go scot-free. According to Cheshire, the officials of Kochi corporation and Maradu municipality have issued building permits on either side of Chilavannoor backwaters without insisting on securing no-objection certificate (NOC) from KCZMA, which is mandatory for starting constructions in such areas. “I had lodged a case against the officials with these local bodies who allotted building permits for constructions violating CRZ norms. The case is still pending before Muvattupuzha vigilance court,” Cheshire said. “I had moved the high court seeking eviction of encroachments upon Chilavannoor backwaters. The court ordered the district administration and survey department to survey Chilavannoor backwaters and identify encroachments. But a proper action on the part of the revenue department and survey department is still pending,” Cheshire said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chilavannoor-crz-violation-files-untraceable-rti-reply/articleshow/87090111.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

According to party insiders, the camps of former GPCC president Bharatsinh Solanki, former GPCC president Arjun Modhwadia and state working president Hardik Patel have lobbied for their respective leaders to lead the state Congress unit into next year’s crucial election. The two key posts of GPCC president and LoP have been vacant for more than six months after Amit Chavda and Paresh Dhanani quit following the party’s drubbing in the local body polls. Their resignations were accepted and they were asked to continue until new appointments were made. The process of appointing new leaders was derailed following the untimely death of AICC Gujarat in charge Rajeev Satav in May this year. Earlier this month, the party high command appointed Raghu Sharma as AICC Gujarat in-charge. Insiders in the state Congress unit said that AICC Gujarat in-charge, Raghu Sharma, met representatives of all three camps within the Congress and got a feedback on the popularity of leaders of all three groups. Sources said Sharma discussed the various contenders for the post of GPCC president and LoP at the CWC meeting – the highest decision making body of the Congress — in Delhi on Saturday. The names of the new GPCC president and LoP is expected to be announced within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-camps-pitch-for-key-state-cong-posts/articleshow/87090112.cms||---

Also present for the inspection were DCP (Zone1) Amol Tambe, DCP (HQ) Pournima Chaugule-Sringi, ACP (traffic) Seetaram Gaikwad and others. The permission to put up hoardings and banners at public places will be granted only after scrutinising the matter to be displayed. The step has been taken to ensure that nothing objectionable, which could hurt the sentiments of any section of people and/or disturb the law and order situation of the city, is displayed on these hoardings. Therefore, people have to take permission from the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) as well as the police. Meanwhile, for existing hoardings and banners, the owners have been asked to take permission and put NMC, as well as, the police permission numbers on them before October 15. Pandey on Saturday visited Ashok Stambh, Meher Signal, CBS, Trimbak Naka, Mumbai Naka, City Centre Mall, etc. to check if the hoardings had police permission numbers.

---||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court imposes Rs 25,000 fine on prosecution for using delaying tactics||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on the prosecution, to be deducted from the salary of the alleged erring officer, for delay in moving an application for segregation of complaints and conducting further investigation in a northeast Delhi riots case. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg directed the state to pay the fine to all the seven accused in equal proportion, while noting that the delay led to undue harassment of the accused people, two of whom are still in judicial custody. The matter was listed for arguments on charge, however, a request for adjournment was made on behalf of prosecution on the ground that further investigation in the present case was being carried out in the wake of an order passed by a sessions court on September 10. The sessions court had directed that the complaint of Akil Ahmad be separated from the remaining complaints in the FIR as the incident pertaining to his complaint was of February 25, 2020. During the proceedings before the magistrate court, though the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) stated that the complaint of Ahmad was segregated, a status report filed by the investigating officer (IO) stated that all the complaints received in the present case, except the complaint of original complainant Faizan Khan, were in respect of the same place of incident, whereas, there is no mention of any specific date and time of incident at the shop of Khan and hence the same has been segregated. When the IO was directed to produce the case diary to show the investigation carried out by him after the September order, it was submitted by him that no such case diary has been written in the present case after the sessions court’s order. On the other hand, it was submitted by the SPP, appearing for the state, that the supplementary chargesheet with respect to the complaint of Khan was almost ready and shall be filed within a period of three days. “In view of inconsistency in the submissions made on behalf of IO as well as SPP regarding segregation of investigation qua the complaint of Akil Ahmad on the one hand and of the complainant Faizan Khan on the other, it is apparent that the prosecution is still not sure as to how it should go about further investigation/prosecution in the present case and the only purpose for seeking permission for further investigation is to derail the further proceedings in the present case,” the court observed. The court directed the Commissioner of Police to furnish a detailed report regarding steps taken by him to ensure proper investigation/prosecution of the cases pertaining to NE Delhi riots and their expeditious trial within a period of seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-court-imposes-rs-25k-fine-on-prosecution/articleshow/87092125.cms||Usha Das

Many colleges are likely to reopen within a week’s time as they need to ensure staff are vaccinated, and schedule classes in batches along with other protocols in place. Mayur Sanas, a third-year student at MIT College in Kothrud, said his second dose is due in the last week of October and he is waiting to book a slot. “The college will only allow students who are fully vaccinated, so I will attend classes after being fully vaccinated,” said Sanas. Postgraduate business administration student Rashi Kotecha, who studies at Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, said her second dose of the vaccine is due on Monday and she has booked a slot. “We are still awaiting instructions on the class schedule, but I will be eligible whenever they reopen,” said Kotecha. Some, however, may have to wait longer. Student Krishangi Deo, whose second shot is due in the middle of November, said the gap between both doses should be reduced. “Several of my friends and I are want to attend classes in person but our second shots are due much later. The government should reduce the gaps so many who want to attend classes cannot get a chance.” Principal of AISSMS College of Engineering, D S Bormane, said the university may issue guidelines regard reopening based on government directions. “We are collecting vaccination information from students.

While the results are not as evident on the city streets, the rush of motorists to get their towed vehicles back from the city traffic branch office is continuous. From January 1 to June 30 this year, the city police had taken action against 10,019 motorists for illegal parking, which converted into roughly 1,669 cases per month. After the towing vehicles were deployed in July, police had taken action against 14,061 motorists for illegal parking by September-end. Thus the monthly average of these three months is over 4,600 motorists being challenged for illegal parking every month. Despite this, the situation does not appear to have improved. Every day, many vehicles are parked by the roadside in College Road and Gangapur road. Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Seetaram Gaikwad said currently two cranes and three pick-up vans are used to pick up the illegally parked vehicles. In the near future, more cranes and pick-up vehicles will be deployed, which could control the menace of illegal parking. Illegal parking is also rampant in places like Nashik Road and Cidco, where the towing cranes have not been deployed yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-deployment-of-towing-vans-sees-nearly-3-times-rise-in-police-action/articleshow/87088573.cms||Santosh Sonawane

According to monthly crime data, Jaipur police filed 84 murder cases till September this year, compared to 69 last year and 76 in 2019 in the same period. With 29 cases, the west zone of the police commissionerate recorded the highest murder cases this year, followed by the south with 25 cases. Of the 84 cases reported this year, police filed chargesheet in 25 cases while a final report (FR) was submitted in 11 cases. The city reported some of the major high-profile murder cases in the past few weeks. A 29-year-old travel agent was beaten on VKI road, leading to his death in the hospital on Friday. Similarly, on September 21, four men first shot and then smashed the head of a history-sheeter Ajay Yadav ( 42) following a bitter rivalry. Police arrested several key accused, including conspirators and shooters. Police said that, unlike last year, the lockdown was staggered during the second spell of the pandemic due to which some crime incidents increased. “We have a compulsory FIR registration protocol. Each complaint has to be converted into the FIR and that is probably one of the reasons why some offences reported a spike,” an official said. Sources said that besides petty rivalries and gangland murders, personal enmity and ego tussles were also contributed to the increased in murder cases. For instance, on August 31, a 30-year-old man was beaten to death following a scuffle with the husband and paramour of a woman at Muhana Mandi. Police discovered during the interrogation that the accused were in an inebriated condition and murdered the man following a quarrel. A case redolent of Muhana also transpired in the Brahmpuri area where Mehraz (25) was killed on September 29 by four youths following an argument at a tea stall. The city also witnessed what police described as “corporate murder,” when a 65-year-old project consultant was shot dead in front of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) office in Vaishali Nagar on August 26. It was found that the killing was organised by a leading builder from Gurgaon following disagreements of a construction project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/murder-cases-reports-spike-in-city/articleshow/87092182.cms||---

The recent doctoral work of Shefali Uttam of Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad studied the dust devils on the Red Planet, drawing new insights into planetary atmosphere. Uttam got her PhD from IIT-Gandhinagar this year. She was guided by Prof Varun Sheel of PRL. Talking to TOI, the researcher and her guide said that the objective of their study was to find the conditions that lead to the dust devil formation. “The effect of dust on the atmosphere and climate of Mars is being studied around the globe,” said Prof Sheel. “The main natural sources of dust in the atmosphere of any planet are dust storms and rotating columns of rising dust known as dust devils. The study at PRL was based on the observations from a rover on Mars and analytical and numerical approaches.” The study found that the strength of the dust devils is related to the height of the lowest part of the atmosphere. It is the first study to use UV-logger data on a rover on Mars. Reduction in UV levels is also a factor for dust devils along with pressure, said the researchers. The study found that local summer time witnessed more prominent activity of dust devils. The research highlighted the ‘tribocharging’ phenomenon due to which the particles in a dust storm get charged depending on their size and create an electric field. The experts said the dust devil may be accompanied by lightning in these storms, a phenomenon very similar to lightning in clouds over Earth. Prof Sheel said that the dust devils on Mars could be huge, have wind speed of about 3 to 5 times higher than those on Earth, and show that the planet is alive. “The study of this phenomenon also holds key to understanding the Martian climate. They impact temperature (by exposing the soil beneath its red surface) and winds, they can act as nucleus for cloud formation, or for ozone loss,” he said. “The information is crucial for future missions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dust-storms-villains-on-earth-blessing-on-mars/articleshow/87090185.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Setback for BJP as ex-MP Bhaskar Patil-Khatgaokar quits ahead of by-election||AURANGABAD: Former state minister and BJP state vice-president Bhaskar Patil-Khatgaokar, an influential veteran politician from Nanded district, on Sunday announced he was quitting the party to re-join Congress. Blaming BJP MP Pratap Patil-Chikhalikar for “gross indiscipline” in the party, Khatgaokar said the party top-brass did not take any cognisance of complaints raised by him. Along with Khatgaokar, who had left Congress around seven years ago, former MLA Omprakash Pokarna and a group of local BJP leaders also announced rejoining Congress. The political development may prove to be a setback for the BJP as the by-polls for Deglur assembly seat is around the corner. Addressing reporters in Nanded, Khatgaokar, a former minister of state who also got elected to Lok Sabha in 1998, 1999 and 2009, said he was not consulted by the BJP before declaring the candidate for October 30 by-election. “It was due to insistence of Chikhalikar, BJP has fielded an imported candidate from Shiv Sena for Deglur by-poll. The local BJP unit has become personal property of Chikhalikar with many loyal party workers facing injustice,” said the three-term ex-MLA. The 77-year old also cleared that he would campaign for Congress candidate from Deglur candidate Jitesh Antapurkar, who is taking on Subhash Sabne of BJP. Khatgaokar was reportedly upset with the BJP ever since the party denied ticket to his daughter-in-law for 2019 assembly poll from Naigaon seat. Hailed as “king-maker” in Nanded district, he is expected to leave his influence over upcoming Deglur by-poll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ex-mp-bhaskar-patil-khatgaokar-resigns-from-bjp/articleshow/87092159.cms||Prasad Joshi

A section of experts, however, said the eagerness might not necessarily translate into good turnout once the vaccine for the kids is launched. While Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D has got the approval for use in adolescents and is likely to be launched this month, an expert panel on Tuesday also allowed Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for use in children between the ages of 2 and 18. In the initial phase, the vaccine would be given only to children with pre-existing illnesses and the healthy kids will be included in the next phase. “There is more eagerness than hesitancy among parents for the paediatric Covid shot. They are actually more concerned about the reasons for the delay now,” said paediatrician Pramod Jog, who is also one of the members of the state’s paediatric Covid task force. He said he was getting 20-25 calls every day from parents inquiring about the availability of the vaccine in Pune. “Going by the constant inquiries, the ratio of vaccine eagerness to hesitancy is 70:30. Many parents want their kids to be among the first in line to get the shot. These are mainly parents of the children with underlying medical conditions,” Jog said. As schools have been physically reopened for some classes, parents are also worried about “classroom outbreaks”. “The vaccine eagerness also stems from this concern,” said senior paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, who is also one of the paediatric vaccine trial investigators in India.Some experts are also of the view that present keenness for the paediatric Covid shot may not actually translate into a turnout when the vaccine for children is launched. “Eagerness is fine. But many parents, I think, would take a cautious ‘wait and watch’ stand when it will come to vaccinating their children. Covid has largely spared children and many parents know this. The contagion is not a healthcare emergency for kids the way it has been for adults. Besides, parents feel that their kids might have had the infection as one of the family members had tested positive in the recent past,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s chief paediatrician Rajan Joshi. Many families with kids at greater risk of contracting the infection are eagerly waiting. “My child has a compromised immune system. We have to keep him under many restrictions. Hopefully, he will be among the first to get the jab,” said a family from Kothrud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-eagerness-than-hesitancy-for-paediatric-ncov-vaccines-in-pune/articleshow/87092160.cms||Umesh Isalkar

I will speak to all collectors to ensure the scheme is implemented and women benefit,” the minister told TOI on Thursday. Thakur said data of the last one-and-a-half years has been collated by the department. A group under the Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti (CEMPS), which recently conducted a survey, said that over 1,000 women have been struggling. Heramb Kulkarni, representing CEMPS, said several emails have been written to the department and they have reached out to various officials to no avail. “Nearly 20 of 35 districts have not formed committees to disburse certificates to affected women. We reached out the administration officials and they have not given us data either. Taluka-wise samitis have not yet been formed despite a GR being issued on August 27,” said Kulkarni. Some women, who have lost their husbands, said they have been struggling to get their names registered on the ration card or change the name in property documents.“I lost my husband last year and have made many rounds of the local talathi office. I am not getting any help to even get the death certificate,” said a woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/collectors-get-until-month-end-to-form-panels-for-covid-19-widows-scheme/articleshow/87092188.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The minor was not only held captive, but also beaten and sexually abused. Two people were arrested for the crime. A cop who was a part of the rescue operation said, “When I entered the room, she hugged me and started crying. She told me that she was beaten up by the men. She had several injuries.” On September 16, the girl was lured by Neeraj Sonkar, a resident of Paschim Vihar, and taken to Agra on the pretext of visiting a fair. “One of his associates, Muskan, also accompanied them. At Agra, the girl was kept in the house of one Sheetal. The trio finally sold her for a mere Rs 60,000 to one Gopal Lal,” said joint commissioner (Crime) Alok Kumar. After registering a case, a team led by ACP (Anti-Human Trafficking Unit) Surender Gulia, including inspector Amleshwar Rai, head constable Gopal Krishan and constable Vijay Kumar, started investigation and caught Sonkar from Paschim Vihar. It was revealed that Lal had “purchased” the girl to get her married to his brother-in-law, Daanvir (38). She was kept in a house built on farmland in Sikar, Rajasthan, an officer said. The team, accompanied by the girl’s brother, first visited Agra and then Sikar. The house where the girl was kept in was at such a place that any transport facility was 5-10 kilometres away. The cops left their vehicles 1.5km away, walked to the house and caught Lal outside. “Lal told us about the room where the girl was kept and she was rescued. We left the place with the girl and Lal within 10 minutes,” the officer said. While the accused have produced documents stating that the girl was married to Daanvir, police are checking their authenticity. “We suspect that it was a forceful marriage,” added the officer. Police said the girl was beaten with sticks and sexually abused. “She was held captive in a room. Whenever she used to ask them for a phone to contact her family, they used to tell her that they had purchased her. They used to keep a tab on her whenever she would come out of the room for daily activities,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teen-kidnapped-sold-rescued-after-a-month/articleshow/87092185.cms||---

Sources in the automobile industry told TOI that the average cost per km for the fuel has now crossed Rs 5. “The expenses for driving a diesel car in 2020 was an average Rs 3.3 per km in May last year. This has now shot up to Rs 5.1 per km — an increase of 55% in one and a half years,” said a source. Petrol is now retailing at Rs 111.77 per litre in Mumbai while its price in neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai stands at Rs 111.90. The revised rate of diesel in the cities is Rs 102.65 per litre. The price of petrol was the highest in Parbhani at Rs 114 per litre, while diesel costs the most in Amravati at over Rs 104 a litre. Transporters across the country have threatened to go on a nationwide chakka jam to protest the diesel price hikes.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: RVUNL’s investments in solar energy may further burden consumers||JAIPUR: The debt-laden Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RVUNL) has decided to set up solar energy plants of 800 MW capacity and invest about Rs 3,200 crore despite the trend of discoms of other states and power procuring entities preferring the third party route through competitive bidding that has brought down costs of the renewable energy to about Rs 2 a unit. Financially, RVUNL is also not in a position to contribute a share of 30% equity in the project even if it mobilises loans from banks. The Nigam already owes lenders about Rs 24,000 crore and the interest it would pay won’t come cheaper given the credit profile. Experts in the power sector said instead of investing such a huge amount, RVUNL would be better to get the cheaper solar power through a developer in RESCO (renewable energy service company) mode and blend it with thermal power which would avoid the huge loan burden. Andhra Pradesh is working on a strategy to supply cheaper power to farmers by setting up of 10 GW solar energy plants through private investors instead of itself making the heavy investment. The private developers will be selected through competitive bidding and power will be purchased by the government at much lower rates to reduce their subsidy burden without any investment. Rajasthan has highest installed solar energy capacity of 7737.95MW in the country. Maximum capacity of it has been installed by developers or investors and the generated power is being exported to various discoms and power procuring entities including SECI, NTPC, Maharashtra, Haryana, and UP among others. The power is purchased by these agencies at cheaper rates without making heavy investments unlike RVUNL’s proposed 800MW projects. Simran Grover, CEO of Bask Research, said, “There is an opportunity for RVUN to drive Rajasthan’s clean energy transition through solar and other low carbon technologies and storage. However, there is a word of caution. If such investments are allowed through the cost-plus or regulated tariff regime, it shall be counter-productive for the sector, the state, and the electricity consumers.” He said the RVUN should participate in a free and fair competitive market to avoid unnecessary inefficiencies in the journey of clean energy transition. In a cost-plus pricing mechanism, the seller calculates all costs, fixed and variable, incurred in producing power and then applies a markup percentage to these costs to estimate the asking price. In this model, the power generator’s inefficiencies are passed on as a cost where as in a competitive bidding and third party mechanism, the cost is much cheaper. In recent biddings, the prices for solar energy has come down to Rs 2 a unit, which is expected to be much higher in case of a cost-plus approach. Earlier, heavy investment were made by RVUNL for setting up of Giral lignite plant, Ramgarh gas plant and Dholpur gas plant. But they are not utilized properly and investment made by RVUNL is becoming bad debt. All these imprudent financial decisions have added to the high cost of power that people in Rajasthan are paying. Model of developing infrastructure projects by government organizations is not cost effective unlike private investors. Most of the highways projects, airports, and urban infrastructure projects are developed by private investors or through PPP model for efficiency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rvunls-investments-in-solar-energy-may-further-burden-consumers/articleshow/87092267.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

With 1.39 lakh Covid deaths registered in Maharashtra, the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) will have to disburse nearly Rs700 crore as ex gratia, stated officials. With the disbursal of this amount to be carried out by the state government in the coming week, additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas, in a detailed note, directed formation of grievance redressal committees in rural and city areas. “Kin of Covid deceased having grievances regarding certification of Covid deaths can approach the grievance redressal committees under the collector in rural areas and under the deputy municipal commissioner in city areas for delay in disbursal of ex gratia,” stated the order. The entire process will have to be completed within 30 days on submission of details. Dr Vyas directed the committees be formed immediately to take remedial measures, including issuance of amended official documents, after verifying facts. State disaster management officials had told TOI that a portal would be readied for collectors to make entries and ensure easy disbursal of funds once the name of the kin of the deceased and other details are entered into by the local authorities after due verification of death certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/grievance-redressal-committee-set-to-address-ex-gratia-related-issues/articleshow/87092194.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kolhapur||Satej tells officials to note demands for rehabilitation||Kolhapur: The long wait of the flood-affected residents of Chikhali and Ambewadi villages for permanent rehabilitation is likely to end soon. Satej Patil, the district guardian minister, has instructed the authorities to take note of the villagers’ demands, especially related to the plot requirement for permanent settlement. Patil has visited both the villages several times and has spoken with the local authorities to make sure the issue sees some progress. Since 1989, the villages have been hit by floods many times. Earlier, the villagers were given plots for permanent resettlement at the Sontali village. However, due to the lack of amenities, people could not shift there. Patil said, “Since the first settlement and rehabilitation plan was made, the number of families has increased. We want complete data on the number of families, members in each family and their requirements. We are planning 100% rehabilitation of the villagers.” The Chikhali village is located at the confluence of five rivers, which further become the Panchaganga river. Ambewadi is located downstream of the Chikhali village. The villagers are ready to shift their houses, but do not want to surrender their farmlands. The villagers mostly grow sugar cane and some have jaggery-making units. Even after the sugar cane crop was totally damaged after the floods in June, the villagers did not want to surrender their farmlands. A villager said that a crop like sugar cane is damaged only if the floods are massive and wash out the entire crop. Such massive floods occur rarely, once every 10-20 years. In such a scenario, surrendering the farmland is like surrendering livelihood. “Many villagers have claimed that the plots given to them at Sontali village back in the 1990s have been encroached upon. I have asked the revenue authorities to survey the site and make a plan to rehabilitate the villagers on vacant plots,” added Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satej-tells-officials-to-note-demands-for-rehabilitation/articleshow/87092189.cms||---

N K Arora, who heads the Covid-19 working group of the Centre’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) told TOI on Sunday that in addition to the Covishield-Covaxin trials currently under way at Christian Medical College in Vellore, more studies involving vaccines or different platforms could be necessary. “The idea is to find the best possible combination that will not only improve the degree of protection, but also is safe and extends the durability of protection against Covid-19,” Arora said. In heterologous priming, the first and the second doses are different but based on the same vaccine platform. In heterologous boosting, vaccine doses are from different platforms. “This strategy may have the potential to improve the durability of the post-vaccine immune response against SARS-COV-2. Some preliminary data on the immunogenicity and safety of this approach is available internationally but is limited by the observational nature of the studies and a small sample size,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the National Covid Task Force. “Systematic studies are needed before this can be rolled out. If found effective, such an approach may improve vaccination logistics apart from the potential for higher immunogenicity,” Pujari further said. Mix-and-match method The mix-and-match method created a buzz in India an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) analysis of the “serendipitous” mix of Covishield and Covaxin in Uttar Pradesh found the combination not only safe, but also eliciting more potent immune response. This was in addition to several other studies on different vaccine combinations across the world. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel has recently warned that such studies require cautious interpretation. WHO, with support from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its covid-19 Vaccines Working Group, is reviewing emerging evidence on the use of heterologous priming schedules, also known as mix and match schedules. t||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-trials-in-the-offing-to-find-best-vax-combo/articleshow/87092242.cms||Umesh Isalkar

As per expansion plan, two more storeys are to be added at the existing three-floor hospital building. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has also instructed the officials to make financial provisions for the college in the budget for the financial year 2022-23. The proposed PG medical college is to be affiliated to Mumbai-based autonomous educational institute — College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS). Jadhav during a recent meeting directed the health department officials to send a proposal to the CPS and the National Medical Council for their approval. Earlier, the NMC had planned to start PG medical college & hospital from this financial year, but could not do it due to the second wave of the Covid pandemic. But as the situation has improved and Covid restrictions have been relaxed, the civic body has again initiated the plan for proposed PG medical college and hospital project. The NMC had registered the first Covid patient on April 6 last year. In a bid to treat Covid patients, the NMC had converted its two civic hospitals — Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospitals — for Covid patients. The Bytco hospital has over 750 beds, including over 300 oxygen beds. During the second wave in March and April, the hospital was fully occupied. But the cases have now dropped significantly and there are only 27 Covid patients undergoing treatment in the hospital. “Experts from CPS will inspect Bytco hospital for the proposed PG courses and suggest additional changes or measures needed to be undertaken by the civic body at the Bytco hospital,” a civic official said. The NMC will get around 60 trainee doctors in different specializations for its proposed post-graduate medical education college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-plans-expansion-of-bytco-bldg-for-pg-college/articleshow/87088674.cms||Tushar Pawar

The state home department issued guidelines stating that not more than 15 persons and one vehicle will be allowed in each procession of Eid-e-Milad that will be celebrated on Tuesday to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad. The guidelines also say the procession can only be taken out during the day hours in view of the night curfew in force in eight cities of the state. The government said that the movement of processions should remain restricted to their localities so that they are completed in minimum possible time. “Eid-e-Milad will be celebrated on October 19. The government has taken the decision in view of applications received requesting permissions to take out processions and organise other programmes on the day,” said the circular issued by the home department. Earlier this month, the state government had decided to extend the night curfew in eight cities of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh and Bhavnagar till November 10 that remains in force between 12 midnight and 6am.

---||Delhi||High-speed Delhi-Meerut corridor to extend medical lifeline to NCR||NEW DELHI: The high-speed Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor, which will cover the distance of 82km between Delhi and Meerut in 60 minutes, will act as a lifeline for people facing medical emergencies. While Metro trains are equipped to accommodate wheelchairs in their first and last coaches, which have the driver’s cabin, the high-speed trains that will run on RRTS corridors are being designed to accommodate not only wheelchairs but stretchers too. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is executing the project, said that RRTS stations have also been designed to provide a seamless travel experience to passengers who are specially-abled, and when needed, to those who might be facing a medical emergency. Currently, it takes about three-and-a-half to four hours to travel by road from Begum Pul in Meerut to Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. When the Delhi-Meerut RRTS becomes operational, passengers will be able to cover the same distance within an hour. This would not only mean a much faster and more comfortable commute for people living in NCR and travelling long distances for work or other purposes, but also for those who need to reach a hospital. NCRTC believes that many people across NCR would be able to reach major multi-specialty hospitals in the capital, and when other corridors, such as the Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor, start, hospitals in Gurgaon can be reached swiftly. Apart from the trains, RRTS stations will also have four to five larger than usual elevators that will be able to easily accommodate stretchers and passengers. The elevators, which will be around 7 feet by 3 feet in size, would be like the ones seen at hospitals. The staff at RRTS stations would also be trained to help passengers facing a medical emergency. “The entire infrastructure for the country’s first RRTS is being designed in a manner to ensure that the transit network is compatible to handle rare medical emergencies,” an NCRTC spokesperson said, adding that ensuring universal accessibility across the RRTS network has been one of the core guiding principles for the corporation since the inception of the project. The RRTS station at INA, for instance, is close to big hospitals like AIIMS and Safdarjung and when operational, it will help people from across NCR looking for urgent medical attention. The spokesperson said RRTS would be the most efficient and convenient mode of commute available for people and help save precious lives. He added that it is a transformational urban transport project, which will empower people through better access to healthcare, education, employment, and economic opportunities, apart from addressing issues of vehicular congestion and air pollution. “RRTS will improve the overall quality of life of people in NCR by providing a fast, reliable, safe, comfortable, and sustainable mobility solution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rrts-to-extend-medical-lifeline-to-ncr/articleshow/87092255.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The government has taken the decision in view of applications received requesting permissions to take out processions and organise other programmes on the day,” said the circular issued by the home department. Earlier this month, the state government had decided to extend the night curfew in eight cities of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh and Bhavnagar till November 10 that remains in force between 12 midnight and 6am. For the just-concluded Navratri festival, it had allowed garba dance celebrations in residential societies with relaxation in night curfew timing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/eid-processions-allowed-with-restrictions/articleshow/87098357.cms||---

The kiosks were demolished in July. “The plan to accommodate 76 kiosks is in its final stage, but the file is pending approval. We have lost patience and have decided to hold a peaceful agitation,” a kiosk owner, Dominic Pereira, said. On Monday, they intend to hold a dharna at Fernandes’ residence at 9.30am and publicly appeal to him to raise the issue at the assembly. “If the authorities permit us to make a decent income in Goa itself, there will not be any need for us to leave the country .Our rights must not be denied to us,,” Pereira said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-kiosk-owners-to-hold-protest-today/articleshow/87094432.cms||---

These three major routes are from Nimani bus stand to Nashik Road, Pawan Nagar and Bardan Phata. NMPML, a transport wing of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), has also started buses on routes like Ozar, Trimbakeshwar and Sinnar but it is not getting much response. While the per km earning to Trimbakeshwar and Sinnar is Rs 10 and Rs 20, respectively. The route to Ozar is fetching Rs 35 per km earnings. NMPML officials said there has been a huge footfall of passengers from Nashik Road and Cidco to Nashik city. “While the average earning of all the routes altogether is around Rs 35 per km, these three routes are giving more than two times of an average per km earning,” said the officials. At present, the NMPML has deployed 98 buses and is likely to deploy 20 more buses on various routes from next week. NMC took over the city bus service from Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) on July 8 this year. The civic body started the city bus service with 22 buses on eight routes. Initially, the daily footfall of passengers was 3,000 and daily earning was around Rs 30,000 per day. But in the last three months, the daily footfall of passengers has crossed 50,000 per day with an average earning of Rs 6 lakh per day. NMC has deployed two private agencies to procure, operate, maintain and manage city buses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-bus-service-3-routes-most-profitable/articleshow/87088720.cms||Tushar Pawar

According to rough estimates, of the total 227 seats, north Indian voters can play the swing factor in 50—most of them are in the suburbs. Muslims comprise 40% of the north Indian voting population where a fight is expected between Samajwadi Party and Congress. Traditionally, a large chunk of the north Indian community would vote for Congress, but in the 2017 BMC polls, many switched to BJP, according to political observers.BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the party has already hit the ground to woo voters from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. “The first Chaupal meet was conducted in my ward in Dindoshi where Devendra Fadnavis interacted with residents. We are confident that north Indian voters are with BJP,” he said. “We are also conducting Marathi Katta to connect with Maharashtrian voters.” Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap recently announced the setting up of the Uttar Bharatiya Panchayat in Mumbai. “Through the Uttar Bharatiya Panchayat, we will find out the issues and problems of the north Indian community and resolve them,” he said. Congress leader Suraj Singh Thakur said they would urge the Congress leadership to give more seats to north Indian candidates. “ Former BJP MLA Abhiram Singh’s son Satyendra Singh recently joined the Congress, while the BJP has appointed ex-Congressman Kripashankar Singh as its state vice-president. Kripashankar is expected to be BJP’s face to woo the north Indians in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/its-chaupal-vs-sammelan-bjp-cong-woo-north-indian-voters-in-mumbai/articleshow/87095260.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Hyderabad||No early polls, lot of work to be done in next 2 years, says Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday ruled out an early election in Telangana for the state assembly, putting to rest all speculations around polls ahead of schedule by opposition parties. The KCR-led Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) had gone for early polls by dissolving the assembly in September 2018 itself with political pundits calling it a masterstroke. KCR’s early poll decision paid off with TRS sweeping 88 of the total 119 constituencies in 2018 polls, decimating the then main opposition Congress. On Sunday, KCR informed party MLAs, MLCs and MPs at a joint meeting of TRS Parliamentary and state legislature members held at Telangana Bhavan here that the TRS government was left with over two years of term with elections due in December 2023 and there was lot of work to be completed, before seeking a fresh mandate from the people of Telangana. The chief minister told party leaders that TRS would first complete all the work during its remaining term. “The party cadre, especially the elected representatives, should work with more vigour to win more assembly and Lok Sabha seats in the next elections,” he said. KCR directed the leaders and party cadre to make the proposed ‘Telangana Vijaya Garjana’ public meeting at Warangal on November 15 a success that would shut the mouth of detractors and send a strong message that TRS was the lifeline of Telangana and that there was no alternative to it. A large fleet of buses and other vehicles will be deployed to facilitate transportation of the people to the ‘Vijaya Garjana’ meeting. An effort would be made to mobilise 10 lakh people, sources said. KCR also appointed party working president and minister K T Rama Rao as the in-charge for the ‘Vijaya Garjana’ public meeting being organised to mark two decades of TRS formation. The meeting also decided to conduct preparatory meetings of all the assembly constituencies with at least 20 constituencies being covered every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-early-polls-lot-of-work-to-be-done-in-next-2-years-says-kcr/articleshow/87094354.cms||Roushan Ali

Track the pollution level in your cityAppealing to the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to understand their responsibilities towards reducing stubble burning and controlling pollution, Kejriwal said, “For the past one month, I have been tweeting data of air quality in Delhi. Pollution has increased in the last 3-4 days due to stubble burning in the neighbouring states. The farmers in the neighbouring states are compelled to burn stubble as their governments are doing nothing for them.” Later in the day, Kejriwal tweeted the latest Air Quality Index of Delhi and remarked that air quality was “steadily deteriorating”, while quoting his previous day’s tweet where he had shared satellite images of Nasa’s Fire Information for Resource Management System. The images showed active burning fires in many parts of Delhi’s neighbouring states.

To stop stubble burning in Delhi, we sprayed the bio-decomposer solution in fields. Farmers don’t need to burn stubble after spraying it. Why can’t the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh spray this liquid?” Kejriwal asked. Earlier, environment minister Gopal Rai said that in the last three days stubble burning had increased rapidly in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. “We started the war room and kept monitoring air quality for 24 hours. We saw that when stubble burning increased in Punjab, Haryana and UP, the pollution level in Delhi increased in the same proportion. The AQI level on October 13 was 171. According to Nasa, the number of stubble burning incidents that day was low. The AQI reached 284 on Saturday due to increased farm fires,” he added. “The Kejriwal government is working towards reducing dust pollution, biomass burning and stubble burning in Delhi.

These works have been delayed by over a year due to Covid and then because of the monsoon. Sumant More, the CEO of NMSCDCL said the Covid outbreak and shortage of workforce affected the major and minor road development projects in the old city area.  “But we have speeded up the road works in the old city areas. We have already undertaken 30 major and five minor roads in the old city areas. We have set a deadline of November-end to complete ongoing work,” said More. “Moreover, the road from Main Road towards Delhi Darwaja, which is already in progress, will be completed within the next 15 days,” he said. The shopkeepers along the Main Road-Delhi Darwaja Road had started an agitation to protest against the delay in the road project and sought completion of the work at the earliest. These shopkeepers had expressed their concern about the slow pace of the road works, which had affected their business. But the new smart city CEO, who took over from the outgoing CEO Prakash Thavil around three months has, has speeded up the road works and is in progress. When asked, More said they will start other proposed major and minor roads shortly and all the road works would be completed by September 2022. NMSCDCL will be developing 171 major and minor roads in old city areas at a cost of Rs 237.21 crore. At present, 35 of them are under construction. The total length of the roads is 36 km.

---||Pune||Host of permissions hold up road widening in NIBM area||Pune: Road-widening work proposed in different parts of NIBM Road-Mohammedwadi area has hit a snag due to the monsoon, a delay in obtaining permissions, and difficulty in finding the required space for expansion. According to the proposal, the breadth of the roads stretching from Jyoti Chowk to Baker’s Point was to be widened to 24m, and towards Kondhwa to 36m. But, plans have been halted due to difficulty in finding the space for the expansion. Local corporator Nanda Lonkar said, “A budget of Rs 2 crore has been sanctioned for the road-widening work, but the space on which we planned the extension is private land, and the owners are not cooperating to give it up. The alternate solution to this is that the boundary wall of the housing societies may have to be pushed back, eating into their parking spaces and so on, which is again not a favourable option for the residents. We are in the process of looking for ways to resolve this conundrum.” The plan to reduce the gradient near Cloud Nine society by 3m has also been halted till the required permissions are granted. The width of the road is currently 10m, and proposed to be extended to 24m. Abhimanyu Sharma, a resident of the area, said, “Accidents are regular here. Motorists and inexperienced four-wheeler drivers cannot handle the steep slope. Pedestrians find it difficult to walk up the slope due to the loose rubble, potholes and heavy traffic.” A resident of Cloud Nine society said water tankers that cater to the housing societies nearby are parked on the slope, spilling water on the road and making it an even more dangerous situation. “For a long time, we have been hoping for the slope to be reduced for the safety of the residents and commuters, but work has yet to start,” the resident added. Deputy Conservator of Forests, Pune division, Rahul Patil visited the area at the end of August on an invitation by Anandavan Mitra Mandal, an NGO which has been maintaining urban forests on the land belonging to the forest department in the area. Residents of the locality also informed him about the need for widening the road and reducing the slope near Cloud 9 housing society, to which he then sent a proposal to the central government. “The permission for such development is required to be given by the Central government, which has not come as yet,” he said. VG Kulkarni, head of road department, Pune Municipal Corporation, said, “We are waiting for some legal decisions to be made. Permissions from the forest department are still due, there should hopefully be some clarity on this in another month or so. The work that was started in Kausar Baug that does not come under the forest department was started, but has been slowed down due to the recent rains. It should be completed in the next few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/host-of-permissions-hold-up-road-widening-in-nibm-area/articleshow/87092339.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Fatty acid profile new test to check spurious ghee||JAIPUR: Miscreants producing adulterated desi ghee using vanaspati oil are selling their product in very cheap prices ranging from Rs 250-350 per litre. They have become notorious as they use certain chemicals which help them maintaining the values of butyro refractometer (BR) and Reichert Meissl (RM) which matches the BR and RM values of good quality desi ghee. The health department’s laboratories check BR and RM values of the sample collected from the market for quality check of the ghee. Even the adulterated ghee passes the BR and RM value test and the firms involve in adulteration escape easily without any action. The BR value should be in the range of 40 to 43 and the RM value should be minimum 26 as per the food safety and standards (food products standards and food additive) regulations 2011. The firms producing the adulterated ghee using vanaspati oil use certain type of chemicals. When such samples are tested, the RM and BR values matches of ghee made of milk. For countering the malpractice, the health department has made fatty acid profile test compulsory of the ghee samples. One of the samples which pass the BR and RM value test failed in fatty acid profile test. The report of the test reads, “Fatty acid profile of sample does not match the fatty acid profile of ghee.” The same sample passed the RM and BR value test. As RM value was 30 and BR value was 42 which matches to the valves of ghee produced from milk. “Fatty acid profile is an effective way of identifying foreign fat in ghee. The fatty acids in milk is different from the fatty acid in Vanaspati ghee. The fatty acid profile is an effective test which helps in identifying the foreign fat in adulterated desi ghee,” said, Prakash Chandwani, a food safety officer in Ajmer district. On October 12, chief analyst (food) Pankaj Midda, took up the issue of adulterated ghee samples passing in quality test on the basis on RM and BR valves. But, they failed in fatty acid profile test. He directed all the food safety officers to get the fatty acid profile done of all the samples of ghee collected from the market for quality test. According to the sources, the fatty acid profile test is available at the government lab in Jaipur, but the health department is making efforts to start the test in other government labs of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fatty-acid-profile-new-test-to-check-spurious-ghee/articleshow/87092330.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The tomb of Hayat Bakshi Begum, one of the few royal women to don the role of princess, queen and queen mother, originally had 15 steps leading to it from the front side. After restoration, only seven are left. The construction of the steps has a historical connotation. Former deputy director of archaeology, MA Qayoom, told TOI that the mausoleum originally had a short staircase with high steps. As Hayat Bakshi grew old and could not take the high steps, they were replaced with a long staircase with low-level steps. The mausoleum was built during queen mother’s lifetime and she would often visit the place to oversee construction of a mosque adjacent to it. The platform also gave her a vantage point to see the Charminar and the tombs of her father Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah V — who founded Hyderabad and built Charminar — and her husband, Sultan Mohammad Qutub Shah VI — who began construction of Mecca Masjid. “By reducing the steps, we will be foregoing an important event in the life of the royal who protected Hyderabad during the first siege of Golconda in 1656,” Qayoom said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/post-restoration-begums-tomb-missing-eight-steps/articleshow/87092819.cms||Syed Akbar

Accused demanded a ransom of Rs 50,000 from the family of the victim. But the cops foiled the abduction drama and rescued Hemen Parsaniya late in the night by tracking down accused’s mobile phone location. Parsaniya, a native of Jam Jodhpur in Jamnagar, lives with his elder brother in Samakantha area. The two accused — Sahil Sandhi and his accomplice Javed — came to Parsaniya’s brother’s house on Saturday afternoon and abducted him at knifepoint. Duo took him to an unknown location on a scooter. Later, they called Parsaniya’s family members and asked them to pay Rs 50,000 for his release. The family approached the police and the cops tracked down Parsaniya based on the accused’s mobile phone’s location. While Parsaniya was rescued, accused duo managed to escape. Parsaniya told police that the duo also beat him. It is reported that Sandhi is in a relationship with Parsaniya’s fiancée Tulsi. Sandhi was miffed when Parsaniya got engaged to Tulsi a few months ago. Sandhi planned to abduct Parsaniya as he thought that the move would force the latter to call off his marriage with Tulsi.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Charminar the culture hub after 340-year hiatus||HYDERABAD: The historic Charminar saw a revival of its ‘public square’ image after a near 340-year-hiatus with Sunday’s ‘Ek Shaam Charminar ke Naam’ drawing scores to experience an evening of cultural and variety entertainment. Between 1591 and 1687 CE, Qutub Shahi rulers would hold all major public events — including festivals and celebrations — near Charminar with hundreds of people participating in them. Festivals like Holi, Diwali and Eid were celebrated on a grand scale at the public square. The rulers too would participate in the celebrations. The chrysanthemum orchards and the fountain (Gulzar Houz) with the four kamans, decorated with festoons, further added to the festivities, as per archival documents. Apart than festivals, the monument was also a centre for ‘melas’ (fairs) and nobility in all their royal regalia with elephants, camels and horses would wait near the public square waiting for their turn to meet the Qutub Shahi kings. Qutub Shahi royal palaces extended from near Charminar to the present-day high court abutting Musi. A daily langar would also be hosted, with the royal palace feeding hundreds — mostly wayfarers and foreign traders. The very purpose of building Charminar was to serve as a mega public place for the common man. There were also Turkish baths and people were given free towels. The Charminar served as Maidan-e-Naqsh-e-Jahan (world public square), replicating the one at Isfahan in Iran. The nobility themselves participated in public programmes there. The glories of the past are now seeing a revival as a result of the government’s efforts. Historic records also reveal that many royal announcements were made at the Charminar and that the streets during the Qutub Shahi period were decorated on major occasions. Professor Abdul Majeed Siddiqui in his ‘History of Golconda’ mentions that Qutub Shahs wanted to create a collective life in their subjects so they could promote social activities, develop their mental and moral faculties and thereby spread their culture across the country. “The common people held their revelries both at Golcunda and Hyderabad (Charminar). Almost all the ceremonial functions, Hindu or Muslim, were accompanied with music and dance,” says Professor Majeed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charminar-the-culture-hub-after-340-yr-hiatus/articleshow/87092485.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Hyderabad||Rich in Telangana seek food cards meant for poor||HYDERABAD: In a startling disclosure, officials scrutinising food security cards meant for poorest of the poor in the state said many affluent people, including owners of large tracts of agricultural land, taxpayers and even government employees, had applied for the scheme. The free Food Security Cards (FSC) are intended for the poor, but during the recent round of verification, the government rejected record 2.82 lakh applications as they were ineligible applicants. Civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar told TOI that scores of denied applications belonged to four-wheeler owners and professionals among others. The state administration granted FSI to around 6.71 lakh applicants after receiving 9,53,394 applications and rejecting 2,82,935 of them. FSC are distributed in two groups depending on income eligibility criteria and they are for the poor. Cards are distributed for Rs 1 to beggars and the homeless, with each card entitling the holder to 36 kg of rice every month. The income criteria for another category says that in rural areas, the annual family income should be less than Rs 1.5 lakh, and in urban areas, annual family income should be less than Rs 2 lakh. Such families would get 6 kg rice per member each month. According to officials, most ineligible people applied for cards because they were unaware that the government had created a new software that would verify each applicant’s status and obtain information from numerous parameters such as assets and taxes paid. According to S Ramakrishna, social scientist and political observer, the disturbing trend could be linked to two factors. “One clear reason is people are being reckless and selfish, as there is a belief in rural areas that not being beneficiaries of schemes will be detrimental to them since their other records, such as voter cards, may be withdrawn,” he explained. In another related development, despite the state government’s request to affluent farmers for “giving up” the money received under the Rythu Bandhu plan, not more than Rs 5 crore was returned under the Rs 50,000 crore spent under the scheme. Two dalits, including a government employee, came forward from Huzurabad and declared that they would not receive the Dalit Bandhu Scheme because they are good without the financial assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rich-in-t-seek-food-cards-meant-for-poor/articleshow/87094395.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Association members also claimed that in the last two years — when the area which was earlier under panchayat rule came under the municipality — land grabbers fabricated documents and applied for HUDA layout. “The town planning officer, who is currently under suspension, had given permission to construct a building in this open space,” said THWA general secretary MS Ranga Chary. Manikonda municipal commissioner S Jayanth was not available for response. Repeated calls, messages from TOI went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/manikonda-residents-stir-over-encroachment/articleshow/87093083.cms||Moulika.KV

Kothrud police told TOI, “The man keeps moving on the society premises and picks up quarrels with the other residents of the society every now and then. On Saturday morning, he argue with the local residents over the issue of sweepers and their timings to clean the society’s premises. The other members retorted. He then charged at some of them and abused them. This enraged the man and he then spit into both the water tanks in a fit of rage neglecting public safety.” The water tanks are located on the ground of society from where the water is pumped o the rooftop tanks,” police said. “In view of the outbreak of Covid-19 situation in the city, he should not have spat anywhere, especially into the water tanks,” they added. Police also invoked the provisions of sections 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) against him, 160 (committing affray), 352 (assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation) and 504 (intentional insult) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-booked-for-spitting-into-societys-water-tanks/articleshow/87092390.cms||---

The event, planned on the lines of ‘Sunday Funday’ which takes place every weekend at Tank Bund, saw the entire 800-metre radius of Charminar — all the way up to Mecca Masjid — filled with activities and events for children and grown-ups alike. Charminar and Mecca Masjid were lit up with tri-colour which was followed by a laser show, a police band performance — Deccani Mazahiya Mushaira. Performers like stilt walkers, jugglers, caricature artists, among several others, kept the crowds entertained all over the place. As part of its green drive, the event organisers — Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) — also distributed saplings among visitors. “After staying at home for almost a year due to the pandemic, I think this is the first big event we have attended. When the government started Sunday Funday event at Tank Bund, we felt like we were missing out as we could not go that far. But now we are really happy that a similar initiative has been taken up in Old City,” said Sunani Begum, a resident of Bahadurpura. Delicacies, right from samosas to pathar ka gosht, lukhmis to kheema parottas, were relished by locals at food stalls were the probably the biggest crowd-pullers followed by stalls selling jewellery and those selling ittar. Laad Bazaar, famous for its lacquer bangles, remained open till midnight with police marking designated parking spaces to ensure smooth movement of people and traffic. “We never imagined a yearly event like Numaish will come to Charminar on Sundays. We are very happy that the authorities took the decision to organise such an event for the public,” said Zubair Khan, a resident of Shalibanda. In the run-up to the event, preparations had been inspected by MA&UD special chief secretary Arvind Kumar who had visited the area with Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, police commissioner Anjani Kumar and other officials of the muncipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charminar-lights-up-sets-mood-for-mehfil-in-motion/articleshow/87092459.cms||---

He said his daughter can hardly keep pace with what’s being taught in online classes. Parents said that even those who used to study well are unable to grasp concepts. Some children are also said to be facing eye problems. “My son’s school intimated they would be starting hostel from October 18. I have decided to send him to the hostel as he is spending a lot of time on the phone playing games and attending classes. We had to get him spectacles as his eyesight has been affected,” said M Kavitha, whose son Gautam is studying in class 8. They said that over the last one-and-a-half months, managements have successfully conducted physical classes without many Covid-19 cases and this gave them confidence their wards will be safe in hostels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wards-at-a-disadvantage-say-parents-of-hostelites/articleshow/87092994.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The woman, Lalarhuitang Lalaringzhuala Ralte, a resident of Aizawl, could only speak Mizo and English. Sources in the Shivaji Park police said they learnt about a young woman crying outside the railway station. After inquiry at the police station, police contacted the manager of the hotel where she was employed and spoke to the authorities. The cops also got the number of the woman’s mother and assured her of her daughter’s safety. “We arranged a bus ticket to Panchgani and she reached there safely,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-help-mizo-woman-crying-near-dadar-stn/articleshow/87095280.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Private schools set to reopen hostels post-Dasara break||HYDERABAD: While the Telangana high court is yet to give its verdict on the reopening of residential schools, private schools in the city and elsewhere in the state have decided to start hostels this week. Private schools, which will reopen after Dasara vacation on Monday, will also be opening hostels as those studying in residential schools are missing out on learning even as their peers are attending physical classes. There are over 10,000 private schools and around 3,000 hostels run by private school managements across Telangana “While quite a few of us have already started hostels, the remaining will be reopening hostels from Monday. We have already intimated parents and many are willing to send their children to hostels,” said Y Shekhar Rao Y, president of the Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA),which has over 10,000 budget schools as members. The TRSMA president said that most residential schools are located in Hyderabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Khammam, Nizamabad, among other districts. Budget school managements said that parents have been asking them to reopen hostels citing loss of learning. They claimed that while the high court has directed the state to not reopen residential schools, the same is not applicable to private schools as the state school education department does not give recognition to hostels. The managements said that they will have to incur a loss if they don’t reopen hostels as parents are looking for alternate options near their residences and they might lose admissions to government schools or nearby private schools. “We are hoping that attendance will pick up in the next one week or so. Soon, we are also going to start hostels start for all classes,” said S Srinivas Reddy, who runs a private school in the city. Managements said that they are ready to take the risk of running hostels during the pandemic and will be following all Covid-19 norms on the campus. Currently, over 32 lakh students are studying in private schools in the state, of whom about 40 per cent are enrolled in residential schools. Quite a few of us (schools) have already started hostels, the remaining will be reopening hostels from Monday.

---||Goa||Goa govt not responsible for oxygen deaths at GMC: Govt panel||PANAJI: The government-appointed committee to probe oxygen shortage in Goa has absolved the state administration and squarely blamed the Goa Medical College (GMC) and the directorate of health services (DHS) for the crisis during the peak of the second wave in May that led to deaths of several Covid-19 patients. In its 35-page report, a copy of which is with TOI but was never put in the public domain, the three-member committee headed by IIT-Goa director B K Mishra said GMC had a severe oxygen shortage but failed to respond in time to avert the crisis. The panel, comprising former GMC dean V N Jindal and revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar besides Mishra, also exposed the oxygen supply mismanagement by the government and the “monopolistic” 10-year contract awarded by the DHS to Scoop Industries. But in its report, the committee was persistent that the interruption in oxygen supply was “unlikely” to have led to deaths of Covid-19 patients. Ironically, just one paragraph before it said that that chances of deaths due to interruptions was unlikely, the report quotes from the affidavit submitted by GMC dean S M Bandekar, who says that a drop in oxygen supply for a significant duration can cause irreversible tissue damage, which can complicate treatment for patients who are comorbid and elderly. “Such a situation can also (cause) death. I say that adequate and continuous supply of oxygen is important to manage Covid pneumonia,” Bandekar had said in his affidavit before the high court of Bombay at Goa. The report does not elaborate on Bandekar’s statement but cryptically states that “in the absence of proper data, linking death with the oxygen supply was an impossible job”. The state government formed the committee to independently review the oxygen crisis and to suggest remedial measures. Following a raft of public interest litigation related to poor Covid management and shoddy oxygen management at GMC, the situation was monitored by the high court. The committee put the focus back on GMC and said the state-run premier hospital did not “timely raise any issue of lack of oxygen or sought augmentation of the oxygen, except putting their demand in affidavit before the high court”. “GMC did not take much action on the letter written by the Goa Association of Resident Doctors. Prompt action on this letter would have enabled better management of the situation,” said the report. The committee confirmed that the drop in pressure occurred while the empty oxygen trolleys were being changed but concluded that the data did not prove that “intermittent incidents of drop in oxygen pressure were long enough to cause loss of life.” TOI had reported extensively on the oxygen crisis at GMC and the pleas from patients for oxygen for their loved ones. Using first-hand reports from doctors, nurses and relatives of patients, the newspaper reported about the spike in the death of Covid-19 patients, particularly between 2am and 6am during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The oxygen supply crunch had forced many people to buy or beg for oxygen cylinders from private agencies to save the lives of their family members. The first week of May saw more Goans die of Covid than in the first seven months of the pandemic. And if it took 10 months for Goa’s death toll to reach 1,000, it took just another 19 days for the next 1,000, as the positivity rate remained over 50% in May, making it perhaps the most affected area in the world. In its report—GMC Oxygen Assessment Report—the committee did acknowledge that the Covid-19 pandemic put unprecedented pressure on GMC. “In June 2018, the decision of the public health department to extend the scope of work awarded to Scoop to all across the state of Goa resulted in the creation of a single supplier for all public health institutions. After this extension, health institutions had no alternative source of oxygen, in case of emergency. As GMC’s oxygen demand rose, Scoop stopped supplying oxygen to the other public hospitals except GMC, without any warning, letter or message,” the report said. “GMC and its oxygen supplier did enhance their capacity to deal with this unprecedented crisis. However, the committee feels that the crisis was much beyond the capacity of GMC. Still, GMC and its oxygen supplier, instead of seeking help, tried to handle the issue itself to the best of their capacity and limitations. Seeking timely assistance would have helped GMC,” said the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-not-responsible-for-o2-deaths-at-gmc-govt-panel/articleshow/87092353.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Centre against farmers & workers, says NCP chief Sharad Pawar||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Hitting out at the Union government at the end of his two-day tour of Pimpri Chinchwad, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday said that the Centre is against workers and farmers and the ruling party does not deserve to be in power with such anti-farm and anti-labour policies. The NCP president said that when he was the chief minister of Maharashtra, he had decided on the decentralisation of industries, which resulted in better employment opportunities in and around Pune. “These industries are in Chakan, Akurdi, Rajnandgaon and other places in Pune which now employ more than one lakh people,” he said. He added that he had opposed the sugar factory in Hinjewadi and had insisted that the area should be developed as an IT hub. Pawar was speaking at the NCP workers’ meet at Rahatni, near Pune. The former Union agriculture minister said when he was heading the ministry in 2004 in the UPA government, only one month of food stock was left and the country was on the verge of importing grain. “At that time, I had decided to change the picture of farming in the country. By 2014, India was exporting wheat to 18 other nations. It was the same with rice too. The Centre now does not care about farmers or workers and it is evident from their policies,” he said. Recalling former chief minister Yashwantrao Chavan’s contribution to setting up factories in the Pimpri Chinchwad, he said that Chavan had met JRD Tata and requested him to set up the Tata Motors in Pune district rather than in Jamshedpur, and had promised every possible assistance. “The present Union government, however, does not care about petroleum products or the common man’s situation,” he said. He also added that the Union government is plotting to destabilize the state government through investigative agencies and holding off GST compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-against-farmers-workers-says-ncp-chief/articleshow/87092436.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Child panel seeks report on minor’s rape case||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Right (RSCPCR) has written to the Jhunjhunu SP asking for a detailed report on the rape of a minor girl by the principal of her school within three days. The panel urged the police to file the chargesheet at the earliest and asked authorities concerned to provide the compensation to the child from the Victim’s Relief Fund. The child rights’ body took cognizance of the matter after Jhunjhunu Police arrested a 31-year-old principal of a government school for allegedly raping a Class 7 girl, along with two female teachers for their alleged involvement in destroying evidence. Police said the girl had confided in the two female teachers posted in the same school. She shared her ordeal with them and also showed a series of lewd messages sent by the principal. Preliminary investigations indicate that the principal had been harassing the girl and sending her obscene messages. She had alerted two of her teachers, but they did not act. The letter from the panel enquired about the present status of the case and the girl’s condition. The panel asked for a copy of the FIR along with the statement of the complainant under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The police have been asked about the development in the arrest of the accused and the reports of the medical examinations. The reports are to be sent to the commission in three days via email. Recently, the child panel had written to the DCP Jaipur (South) seeking a detailed report about a teacher of St Xavier’s School, who allegedly sent obscene messages to teachers and girl students asking them to meet him outside of school. The teacher has been arrested after a case was registered against him at the Ashok Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-seeks-report-on-minors-rape-case/articleshow/87092456.cms||---

BIT’s management has refuted the charges and termed it as an attempt to malign the image of the college. In her complaint, the female teacher accused principal of polytechnic section, Shrikant Goje, and principal of college campus, Rajnikant Mishra, of indecent behaviour with her on the premises on October 6. She alleged that the duo tried to break her laptop and abused her, pulled her by hand and tore her clothes. Complainant teacher said that the Ballarpur police did not pay heed to her complaint while “the college management too turned a blind eye”. Working president of the institute, Sanjay Wasade, claimed that the teacher felt offended after the principal duo reprimanded her in front of some staffers for not holding the online classes. “She should have approached the internal compliant committee meant to address harassment of lady staff. Instead she went to police station. After the matter was explained to police, she formally filed a complaint with college authorities,” said Wasade. According to Wasade, there were five witnesses to the incident and her claims about molestation are baseless. “We sought explanation from both the principals and made them apologies for reprimanding her in front of other staffers,” he said. He claimed that the written complaint filed by the female teacher with college management has no mention of any principal touching or abusing her. “It seems she has been instigated by someone and making false claims to malign the image of the institute,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/female-teacher-alleges-molestation-by-2-principals-files-plaint-with-sp/articleshow/87090775.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Delhi||Rain helps drag Delhi's air quality from ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) deteriorated marginally from 284 on Saturday to 298 on Sunday in the ‘poor’ category. The AQI of the capital had touched the ‘very poor’ range during the day but it improved after the city received rain. According to Central Pollution Control Board’s data, AQI of Delhi was 331 at 12pm on Sunday, but the 24-hour average AQI improved later in the day. CPCB’s central control room data showed that 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration for Delhi-NCR was 176.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 6am, but it reduced to 141.1 micrograms per cubic metre at 6pm. Similarly, 24-hour average PM10 in Delhi-NCR, which was 315.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 6am, was recorded at 249.1 micrograms per cubic metre at 6pm. The standard for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. Experts said as the wind direction changed from north-westerly to easterly, pollution accumulated during the transition phase. However, after rain lashed Delhi and surrounding areas, the air quality improved as rain washed out the pollutants. Following the change in wind direction, the impact of stubble burning was low on Sunday. VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “Due to change in the wind direction, calm wind was recorded during the entire night, causing accumulation of pollutants. The rain helped in cleaning the air. As rain is likely on Tuesday, the air quality may enter the ‘moderate’ category, but it is expected to deteriorate again from October 19.” IMD data showed Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, received 3.3mm rainfall till 8.30am and 16.9mm rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm. Lodhi Road and Ridge also recorded moderate rain at 16.4mm and 26.2mm, respectively, between 8.30am and 5.30pm. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said “Lower wind speed and low mixing layer height were inhibiting dispersion along with moderate stubble intrusion. However, now that wind direction is mainly from eastern side and rain is expected, AQI will improve significantly and touch ‘moderate’ category for Monday and then again degrade to ‘poor’ category for the next two days. The SAFAR effective fire count was observed as 815 but as winds are not favorable and rain is expected, the stubble contribution on Sunday will be just 2%, as against 14% on Saturday.” While an AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as “good”, readings between 51 and 100 fall in the “satisfactory” category and those between 101 and 200 are classified as “moderate”. “Poor” air ranges from 201 to 300, “very poor” from 301 to 400 and “severe” from 401 to 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-helps-drag-air-quality-from-very-poor-to-poor/articleshow/87092476.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Funds swindled from river department, says CAG||PANAJI: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has once again red-flagged financial irregularities in the river navigation department (RND) and has said that lack of oversight and financial management may have led to misappropriation of funds and “understatement of receipts to the extent of Rs 2,10,000”. In an audit observation report dated October 7, the principal accountant general has written to the RND’s administrative officer and the Captain of Ports informing them that a scrutiny of the cash book for the period April 2018 to September 2021 revealed that cheques submitted by High Street Cruises and Entertainment and Ribco Constructions were not recorded in the cash book. High Street Cruises and Entertainment is a subsidiary of Delta Corp, which operates casinos under the Deltin brand in Goa and Sikkim. The audit found an understatement of receipts of Rs 1.3 lakh and Rs 90,000 and consequent short remittance of receipt by the same amount in the treasury. The auditors also went through the receipt books and found that on December 5, 2019, the cashier received Rs 14,749 as toll fee, but recorded Rs 1,096 in the balance sheet and main cash book. The auditors have asked RND to cross check the data and provide a response. This is not the first time that the CAG has identified financial lapses in the functioning of the department. The audit found that the department’s cash book was not prepared from 2018-19 to 2019-20 although considerable revenue of Rs 76 lakh was received in cash towards toll fee in 2018-19. The audit report said it “could not vouch safe the correctness of the transactions” undertaken by the department. As per Rule 13 of the Goa (Receipt and Payment) Rules, 1997, the cash book should be closed regularly and completely checked. The head of the office needs to verify the totalling of the cash book or have it done by a responsible officer other than the writer of the cash book. The rules prohibit erasure or overwriting or pencil entries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/funds-swindled-from-river-dept-says-cag/articleshow/87092440.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED suspects kickbacks were routed through Bhavana Gawali aide||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate has found at least two instances where it suspects kickbacks were camouflaged as payments for government contracts through Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali’s arrested associate Saeed Khan.Khan had received Rs 10 crore from the government for distributing food items to tribals in remote areas of Maharashtra during the pandemic, but he was unaware about its details when questioned by the ED. He also received Rs 5 crore for road construction work as a subcontract from a state-appointed contractor, but he failed to provide any details about the work undertaken, said sources. The ED suspects that the money was siphoned off and no work executed by Khan‘s companies. The ED learnt that Khan got these contracts with the help of Gawali. The ED is inquiring if the money received by Khan’s company was kickback for helping other companies get government contracts. The ED is investigating a money laundering case against Gawali, Khan and others, where they allegedly criminally conspired to convert their trust (Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan) into a non-profit organisation under Section 8 of Companies Act through forgery and fraud. The trust had 11 members, but after converting it to a company, Khan and Gawali ’s mother Shalini became its directors. The duo got full control of the trust and its various assets worth Rs 69 crore. The ED had arrested Khan in the case. In case of food distribution, government contracts worth a total Rs 231 crore were awarded to three different companies. One company obtained half of the total contract and the remaining half was equally divided between Khan’s company and a third entity. The ED asked Khan about the vendor from whom he procured the food items and in which tribal areas and villages were the items disturbed. It asked Khan about prominent people-activists involved in the food distribution. Khan, after providing names of a couple of districts and a supplier, told the ED he was unaware of much of the details. The officials asked the agency that assisted the government’s tribal development department in awarding the contract and learnt that such food items are supposed to be distributed through the local tribal school. Khan reportedly was unable to provide details of any such school. In another instance, a contractor got work from the state and claimed he sub-contracted portion of the work worth Rs 5 crore to Khan’s company. According to government rules, the contractor can not sub-contract the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-suspects-kickbacks-were-routed-through-gawali-aide/articleshow/87095288.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Nashik||Mission Kawach Kundal: 3.8L doses given in Nashik||Nashik: Changing priorities of people since the removal of the Covid-related restrictions, demand for the second vaccination dose and other reasons have resulted in a lower turnout at the vaccination centres under the Kavach Kundal initiative. After the week-long initiative was announced by the state government, the health authorities started round-the-clock vaccination centres at several places across the city. Also, during Navaratra, some centres were set up at temples. At select centres, the authorities even conducted a 75 hours non-stop vaccination drive. However, the health authorities were able to administer vaccines to only 3.84 lakh beneficiaries. The highest number was registered on October 10, with 70,987 beneficiaries being vaccinated. “Since the footfall was lower during this period, the vaccination pace was maintained. However, we are planning vaccination awareness and other activities soon,” said Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and district nodal officer for vaccination. Besides, most of the people visiting vaccination centres had already taken the first dose and were awaiting the completion period of 84 days to be eligible for the second dose. Shailesh Nikam, the Nashik taluka health officer and incharge of vaccination programmes in rural areas said, “The aim is that every citizen should get at least one dose before the third wave sets in.” “It was a festive and fasting period, hence, people stayed away from the vaccinations. Besides, the rain has already affected the farmers and they want to clear their work before Diwali,” said Nikam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mission-kawach-kundal-3-8l-doses-given-in-nashik/articleshow/87088835.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Jailhouse rocked! What can help Tihar regain its credibility||NEW DELHI: After the Supreme Court’s scathing remarks on the Tihar administration, a recent post by retired IPS officer Kiran Bedi, who has headed the jail in the past, has put the spotlight on the current state of affairs at Asia’s largest maximum-security prison that has of late been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Bedi had tweeted: “Something drastically wrong has happened with #Tihar #prisons. Such large-scale mismanagement cannot happen overnight. A judicial inquiry is needed to know when did this decay begin. How and why? It cannot persist. We have to recover and stop this decline (sic).” In the last six months, Tihar has been in the dock for jailed gangsters ordering hits outside, brawls, officials assaulting or killing an inmate and providing undue favours to convicts, like in the Unitech case, for pecuniary gains. From brazen murders to massive mobile phone usage by inmates, Delhi’s jails have been courting multiple controversies. On multiple occasions, Delhi Police has stumbled upon evidence suggesting an organised extortion racket being run from inside the prison. The menace has become huge as all top gangsters are lodged there. Several inmates in leaked videos have alleged that jail officials seek hefty amounts to let them keep a mobile phone or use the internet. Recently, the Delhi high court questioned the prison authorities for not carrying out a proper probe into the alleged murder of an undertrial prisoner. It asked CBI to take over the probe. In this case, the deceased, Shrikant Rama Swami, was supposed to be released on the day he was murdered. The matter had barely gone cold when gangster Ankit Gujjar’s murder rocked Tihar. This time, there were specific allegations and evidence to suggest senior jail officials, including the superintendent, were involved. The latest controversy was the sensational Rs 200 crore extortion case carried out by high-profile conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar, which was first reported by TOI on August 9. Currently, there are around 18,000 inmates lodged in 16 sub-jails. The Tihar complex alone houses more than 12,000 inmates. Most inmates are lodged in the four bigger jails — 1, 3, 4 and 8/9. The rest are scattered across Rohini and Mandoli jails, making management a difficult job. When TOI spoke to several former and serving IPS officers to know what may have gone wrong, a common point was that changes were needed at the grassroots level and knee-jerk reactions would not work in an environment like Tihar Jail. “One has to go inside to see. Can’t say. One can only suspect. Which is why a detailed inquiry is needed by a team that goes inside to see,” said Bedi. Bedi had started with small changes, like Vipassana, which helped inmates remain calm. Her initiatives brought a visible turnaround in the state of affairs. She believed in making the place a reformatory with measures like community building and collective contribution by the administration and inmates. A retired senior police officer on anonymity said things were going downhill as director-generals were being posted at the fag end of their career for a short period. He pointed out how in the last decade the postings had a pattern, except for a couple of aberrations. “In the last decade, the post of the Tihar chief was largely seen as a cooling posting for a Delhi Police commissioner. What Tihar needs is younger and dynamic officers who wish to undertake reforms and not be sent there while looking forward to retirement or the post of the top cop,” added the officer. The officers pointed out that the recent events proved that a sense of accountability was needed to be instilled in the superintendents who needed to be answerable for their actions. “As they manage most affairs, a sense of being indispensable creeps in after certain years. That feeling needs to be checked and frequent reshuffles can tackle that,” an officer suggested. “News reports show a sense of revolt developing among inmates, which is a dangerous thing. The next step could be a jailbreak, so urgent intervention is required,” said another officer. Sandeep Goel, director-general (Tihar), said various measures had been taken to curb clashes inside prisons. “We have identified inmates involved in nefarious activities. We keep rotating them and lodge them in special or high-security wards,” he added. There are hundreds of such inmates, 40-50 in each prison. An officer said sharpened metal strips and blades of fans were being used by inmates to create weapons. “Sometimes, inmates use iron clips used in the mesh.

Class C and D posts are for employees in the health department. Speaking to the media in Nashik, Patil said, “The department is taking steps to ensure all the candidates who have filed applications for both posts in their respective regional circles — Thane, Kolhapur, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Latur, Akola and Nagpur — get the chance to attempt both exams. Their centres would be located at an appropriate distance from each other.” She said there are 2,739 vacancies in 52 cadres of the health department for which recruitment exams will be conducted on October 24. The candidates were asked to file applications for any number of posts and at any place of their choice and the hall tickets would be generated for all the applications. “The examination was to be conducted only on a single day and, hence, it is expected that candidates can appear for examination in any one regional circle of their choice. However, the health department will look into allocation of centres nearby for the candidates attempting both Class C and D examinations that will be conducted at two different timings,” said Patil. About decentralizing the examinations and limiting them regional circle-wise, she said the past experience has been that candidates appeared for the centralized examinations and when posted in remote areas, they would either do not turn up, or quickly get a transfer. “Basically, it is for administrative purposes,” she added. To the question on the candidates being offered centres in two different regional circles, the officer said if the posts applied for fall in the same regional circle, there is no chance of any other centre, but if the posts applied are in two different circles then the candidate will get centres in two different regional circles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/recruitment-exams-for-health-dept/articleshow/87088845.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||After a year, Pune Municipal Corporation school pupils to get financial aid||PUNE: After a long, pandemic-induced gap, city-based municipal school students will finally be able to avail of financial aid for education soon. After over a year, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to provide funds to students to aid in the purchase of uniforms and educational material. The civic body had not disbursed this monetary help last year, since schools were closed due to Covid-19, and only online classes were being conducted.  This year, students from classes VII to XII will be given this aid in the first phase as their offline schooling will restart initially. For long now, politicos have been demanding that this financial aid be disbursed to all students even if their offline classes have not restarted. PMC had given financial aid through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for the academic year 2019-20, but this was cancelled in 2020-21. PMC education committee chairperson Manjushree Khardekar said, “Students will benefit from this aid. As the severity of pandemic is reducing, students will be asked to attend school now. Since they have old uniforms and educational material at the moment, the decision was taken to transfer money to their accounts.” She added that even primary school students should be getting this help as their offline schools may re-open soon, too. The funds are transferred to dedicated bank accounts of students, who have been given DBT cards under the scheme. The pupils are expected to use these cards at select shops to avail of items, and several shopkeepers have been empanelled for the same. A senior PMC official said, “Orders are being issued to make payments to high school and junior college students. A decision about the other students will be taken in the due course of time.” The PMC education department runs 287 schools imparting education in Marathi, English, Urdu and Kannada. Most students admitted here belong socially and financially weaker sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-a-year-pmc-school-pupils-to-get-financial-aid/articleshow/87092482.cms||---

The bridge has been sanctioned in the annual fiscal plan for 2021-22. The state national highway wing of the public works department (PWD) had proposed the bridge in 2016 and had been following up on it with the union ministry. The proposed bridge will connect Borim in Ponda taluka to Angadi, Loutolim in Salcete and will serve as an alternative route to the existing three-decade-old beleaguered bridge over the Zuari. With the nod from the union government in place, the PWD will now begin with land acquisition for the approach road from the Dhavli bypass road circle in Kavlem village to Murme-Tamshirem in Borim. The stretch spans nearly 7 km. Maharashtra-based consultant company Technogem Constructions Pvt Ltd, which had been entrusted the work of consultancy since 2016, will be onboard till the bridge is handed over to the PWD, the department’s executive engineer attached to the nation highway wing, Shashikant Desai, said. The need for the third bridge arose after issues arose in the existing one within a mere three decades of its construction. Work on its rehabilitation had been conducted in 2015-16 by Mumbai-based Fressinet India Limited. The consultant company had conducted the geostatical study for the bridge in 2017 and had suggested three different routes over river Zuari. The union ministry finalised the Borim-Loutolim route. Desai said the union ministry took a long time to sanction this bridge as they had already sanctioned the new bridge over the Zuari and a state cannot get two bridges at the same time. The first bridge at Borim was constructed by the erstwhile Portuguese rulers and the existing one by the state government in 1986. The bridge serves as the only link between Ponda and Salcete talukas. A decade ago, after the condition of the Zuari bridge weakened, heavy vehicular traffic was diverted on to the Borim bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/third-borim-bridge-gets-centres-nod-land-acquisition-to-commence/articleshow/87094580.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Delhi BJP, however, refuted the allegation and said the land was never put up for sale. Pathak alleged on Sunday that the BJP was selling properties of the municipal corporations in arbitrary ways. “First came a proposal to sell Novelty Cinema. Then came an offer to sell four famous parking spaces of Delhi. And now they had come up with a proposal to the sell Dangal Maidan in front of Old Delhi Railway Station,” he said, adding that AAP had been trying to get these proposals cancelled by protesting. “I am extremely happy to inform everyone that BJP has today rolled back the offer to sell Dangal Maidan,” he said. “AAP works only and only in the interest of the public, will never allow anything wrong to happen to the public,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, said that AAP members were making fictitious allegations regarding the civic bodies to politically malign them. “Before making wild allegations Pathak should know that Dangal Maidan was never put up for sale by the north corporation as Dangal Maidan land was allotted to Delhi government’s PWD for traffic betterment activities on SP Mukherjee Marg,” he said.

The passersby and shopkeepers present on the spot doused the fire somehow and alerted the police control room. Subsequently, a police team from Chakeri police station rushed to the spot and admitted the man, identified as Ishwar Chandra Dikshit, with serious burns to Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) hospital. The man’s daughters alleged that he took the extreme step due to police inaction in a dispute over their land in Bidhnoo area of the district. Dikshit has been living on rent in the house of Radhey Shyam Tiwari at Chanakyapuri in Shyam Nagar area of Chakeri for the last four years. His daughter Bhumika told reporters that he had bought a plot measuring 200 square yards in Gangapur Colony in Bidhnoo from one Sunita Verma, a resident of Shyam Nagar, in 2017. On Friday, on the occasion of Dussehra, their family went to the plot to do some puja and associated rituals for starting the construction of the boundary wall. “We were shocked when one Ghanshyam Singh Gaur came to the plot along with police and claimed the plot belongs to him. He had an altercation with my father who then approached Shyam Nagar police outpost and later Bidhnoo police station, but no action was taken. Frustrated and disturbed over police inaction, he went to the Chappan Bhog crossing on Sunday morning carrying a bottle of petrol. He then poured the petrol on himself and set himself on fire,” Bhumika said. The passers-by present at the spot somehow doused the flames and informed the police control room. The police admitted Ishwar Chandra to the LLR hospital in a critical condition. Inspector Chakeri police station Madhur Mishra said, “Ishwar Chandra set himself on fire following a land dispute. Further investigations are on in this connection. His treatment is going on at the LLR, hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-sets-self-afire-over-police-inaction-in-property-dispute/articleshow/87090371.cms||---
---||Jaipur||10 city parks to use Miyawaki methods to grow forests||Jaipur: Mini forests will be springing up in different corners of the city as JDA has started plantation using popular Japanese Miyawaki technique. UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal inaugurated the project from Jawahar Circle to create urban forests. JDA has earmarked 30,000 sqm land in 10 city parks including Central Park and Ramniwas Bagh where it plans to plant approximately 1,20,000 shrubs and plants. The officials claimed that in comparison to conventional methods, the forests using this technique grow faster and become denser and more bio-diverse. A senior official said, "As the city population is growing, we have adopted this method to increase the green cover. It has been experienced and tested that these urban forests help lower temperatures in concrete heat islands, reduce air and noise pollution". The technique compresses layers of a forest – shrubs, trees, canopies – on small plots of land, turning them into tiny forests. "Around 20,000 plants will be planted in Hira Lal Park, Shastri Nagar. Using this technique, forests grow in two to three years and are self-sustaining. The civic body will be planting diverse native species," the official added. Meanwhile, JDA will also de-concretise the base of trees in the city and ensure that at least one metre area around them is left unpaved while laying tiles on footpaths or road construction. In a recent survey, JDA had found that the base of over 3,000 trees was concretised alongside arterial roads and local streets. An official said, "JDA will leave kuccha space measuring 1.5x1.5 around trees and install a grating. This would give longevity to the tress". The aim is to maintain the green cover of the city which is woefully short as per the Master Plan 2025. Sources said, "the city had less than 10% of its area under green cover, which is way less than the mandatory 20% required as per Master Plan 2025."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/10-city-parks-to-use-miyawaki-methods-to-grow-forests/articleshow/87092761.cms||---

The state government has already relaxed the conditions on religious places, throwing them open for a limited number of people per hour to avoid crowding. Now it has given conditional permission for the conduct of the procession too. The dargahs and mosques in the city and across the district are being decked up to celebrate the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammad. Beautiful lights have been installed along the procession route. Shahar-e-Khatib Hafiz Hisamuddin Ashrafi said the community leaders have been discussing the plan to celebrate the festival ensuring all Covid-appropriate-behaviour to contain the spread of the infection and seeking the necessary permissions from the local police. “We thank the state government for conditionally allowing us to celebrate Eid-e-Milad. The police had denied the permission on Friday. But government decision came on Saturday and, therefore, we will meet the commissioner of police again and seek the necessary permission,” said Ashrafi. The community leaders pointed out that they were conducting various competitions related to the Quran and Paigambar for children who will be able to understand the religion much better. Besides, they have also appealed to the people to offer their prayers in a systematic manner so that they do not overcrowd the mosques, given that the Covid restrictions have still not been withdrawn and Covid-appropriate behaviour is still the norm. The authorities at the places of worship have been asked to follow all norms of hygiene and even safe distance besides ensuring hand sanitisers to contain the spread of the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/eid-e-milad-julus-awaiting-nod-from-local-authorities/articleshow/87088851.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||As pandemic hit brakes on red-light areas, sex workers pushed out of cities||MUMBAI: Once in a while, Sonam* takes the train from Nalasopara and travels for more than an hour to reach Mumbai Central station. She walks a short distance to reach Kamathipura, where she had lived most of her life. But during the Covid-19 lockdown, Sonam was left with no option but to move to a kholi in Nalasopara. Here, the rent is much cheaper and she travels to “Bombay” only if it’s to meet an old client. A mapping exercise undertaken by anti-trafficking organisation, Prerana, in MMR’s red-light districts has shown that the number of brothels reduced in 2021 as compared to pre-pandemic times in 2019. Activists say that sex workers largely dispersed to the fringes of the city as incomes dwindled considerably for them, as well as for brothel managers, during the lockdown.  The mapping exercise showed that Kamathipura brothels had reduced from 447 to 433 between 2019 and this year. Now several bag manufacturing units operate out of the same buildings. In the past, Kamathipura used to have more than two dozen ‘caged’ brothels, where women were forced to attend to customers. These too have diminished extensively, over time and have been replaced by guest houses. At Falkland Road nearby, where 382 brothels reduced to 379 in the same period, manufacturing units have seen a clear surge 13 units opened up in 2020-21. There has been an increase in saree roll-pressing and metal work units. Seven new tea stalls have started; one of them by a woman enrolled in an economic rehabilitation programme. Video parlours that provided adult entertainment have also shut down. A middle-aged sex worker told TOI she had started selling vegetables in the lockdown when sex trade halted. “Unfortunately, not all women have been able to transition fully into non-sex-related work. Some of them did start selling essentials during the lockdown. But on days when that did not help them make ends meet, they would go back to attending to customers,” said Priti Patkar, co-founder of Prerana. A large number of sex workers survived on aid provided by non-profit groups during lockdown. At Vashi-Turbhe, where the red-light area was confined to kachha hutments, unlike the pucca buildings of Kamathipura, brothels have reduced from 233 to 216 between 2019 and this year. One of the brothels was replaced by an NGO working for the welfare of women and children. “We have observed a trend of dispersal of sex workers from red light areas to smaller hotspots like Vasai-Nalasopara, Sion-Antop Hill and Kalwa,” said Patkar, adding, “Raigad and Thane are becoming new hubs, but the women don't live next to each other like in a red-light area. Their houses are spread out.” Activists say red-light areas began to gradually shrink years ago, but the pandemic gave it a further push. “Kamathipura and Falkland Road occupy prime real estate. Most of the brothel managers here are tenants. Once these structures go for renovation or redevelopment, the owners don’t always want to lease them back to brothel managers,” said Manju Vyas, who runs Apne Aap Women's Collective. Vyas added that with new-age tech, sex workers have begun to solicit over messaging apps and do not have to remain present in red-light areas anymore. A study by the International Justice Mission (IJM) had shown that absolute numbers of minors in the sex trade has definitely reduced. “We hope that post-pandemic poverty and vulnerability does not rise, which could result in minors being pushed into the sex trade again,” said IJM director Sanjay Macwan.

The jilted lover hails from Kishni area of Mainpuri district while his ex-girlfriend is from a locality under Kotwali police station in Kannauj district. The incident came to light after the victim’s family lodged a complaint at the Kotwali police station on Sunday. Police said a girl from Kotwali police station area was having a love affair with one Deepu, son of Rajendra, a resident of village Chirayahar Ucha Islamabad under Kishni police station in neighbouring Mainpuri district, for the past many years.

The six farmers from Nashik taluka had filed a complaint with the consumer commission of Nashik in November 2019 seeking compensation for the failed crop, for which they had bought seeds from the private company. The order was pronounced by the commission in the last week of September. Apart from Rs 13.32 lakh, the commission asked the company to pay 10% interest on the compensation since July 2019, when the company had rejected the farmers’ claims and pay Rs 15,000 to each of the farmers for mental harassment along with Rs 10,000 for the cost incurred. The farmers said they had bought the ‘hybrid’ seeds after they were promised better crops, good returns and less turnaround time. The farmers carried out all the regular practices for the crop but found that after the creepers started fruiting, they wilted. The panchanama conducted by the committee headed by Gokul Wagh, the sub-divisional officer of the agriculture department stated that the seeds were defective while the agriculture commissioner of quality control, Pune asserted that the creepers died due to disease and also the quality of seeds was found to be impure. The seeds company, however, denied it. Meanwhile, the commission observed that the seeds company had not provided any scientific reports to counter the claims of the government machinery or even the farmer. Hence the company had rejected the claims without any specific reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/seeds-firm-asked-to-compensate-six-farmers/articleshow/87088868.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The racket was being operated from Chhabra, Rajasthan and Devendra Choudhary (44) was the key suspect. His wife was also found involved, cops said. The Cyber Cell started probing the gang after a complainant alleged that while surfing on Instagram, he had come across a page called ‘profit_mania’ which showed screenshots of people conducting binary trading with them. He chatted with the owner of the page who introduced himself as Deepak Sahu and induced him to invest on the pretext of making his money “three times in no time”. The victim scanned QR code in the name of Devendra, which was sent to him on Instagram. After that, the owner of the Instagram page stopped replying to his messages and he realised that he had been cheated. “During investigation it was found that over Rs 12 lakh was credited to Choudhary’s account. The Instagram account was in the name of the suspect teenager, who used to chat with innocent people and then shared different UPI ID or QR codes to accept payment in the name of investment,” Malhotra said. The teenager was handed over to his mother. Other victims of this fraud are also being identified. According to Cyber Cell, this type of fraud had become one of the most common modus operandi nowadays and many fraudsters were operating from different parts of India i.e., to widely publicise investment schemes on social medial platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, etc. The crooks use fancy names crypto mining or binary trading claiming to double the investment of the investor or promise to manifold the investment in no time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/binary-trading-cyber-cell-busts-investment-fraud/articleshow/87092616.cms||---

To overcome the shortfall in generation during the crisis, state government had to shell out additional Rs 197 crore for buying power at higher rates from energy exchange, he added. Raut, who was talking to media on the sidelines of the groundbreaking ceremony of Kalpana Saroj Global Aviation (KGSA), said this has helped in avoiding load shedding. However, during a press conference in Mumbai last week, Raut had said power worth as much as Rs250 crore was purchased. Later, it was learnt by TOI that the state had spent Rs 330 crore for buying power to bridge the gap. TOI also has a document which shows that power worth Rs 197 crore was purchased in September alone. The document showed that costly power at a rate ranging from Rs 1.85 to Rs 20 per unit was purchased from September 22 to 30. From September 22 to 25, as much as 3,600MW power was purchased in a single day. Meanwhile, Raut said the state also purchased power for as much as Rs 16 to Rs 20 a unit to tide over the crisis. The costly power was purchased only for the peak period, which is during 6am to 9am and 6pm to 9pm. Power is purchased from the energy exchange in the normal course also. Usually, it ranges from 200MW to 1,800MW, depending on the demand. Since the situation has normalized, no more additional costly power is needed. As on 9.40pm on Sunday, the overall power demand in the state stood at 18,307MW and the total generation was at 11,919MW. The thermal power plants of Mahagenco were producing 4,850MW. The private plants were producing 5,726MW at the same time. The highest generation was from Adani’s power plant at Tiroda at over 2,700MW at that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raut-maha-shelled-up-to-rs20-a-unit-to-tide-over-power-crisis/articleshow/87092576.cms||Shishir Arya

The worst affected is Firozabad district, where people are rushing to Delhi in the hope to get saline IV bags. Making most of the situation, black marketeers are selling a saline bottle for Rs 500, which otherwise costs around Rs 18. Worse, most chemists are left with a limited stock of paracetamol, antibiotics and other drugs. Puneet Kalra, spokesperson, Agra pharma association said, “In the past one month, the demand for IV fluids has significantly increased following the spread of viral fever and dengue. Six-month stock of 5 lakh bottles of IV fluids was sold out in just 30 days.” “Following the surge in demand, manufacturers are not able to ensure adequate supply. On a supply order of 1,000 boxes of IV fluid bottles, we are hardly getting 100 boxes. A majority of the drug houses in Agra ran out of stock on Sunday,” he said. Trying different chemist shops in Fuwara market of Agra, resident of Narkhi block in Firozabad, farmer Virendra Singh said, “My 12-year-old daughter, who has dengue, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. Now, doctors have asked me to arrange two bottles of half normal saline. I have come all the way to Agra but here, too, it is not available. Now, I have asked my brother to go to Delhi and get at least five bottles from there.” The shortage is apparently due to huge demand, said Sunil Gupta, owner of a drug store. He said, "Besides IV fluids, the demand for paracetamol, antibiotics, tablets for fever, cough, cold, stomach infection has gone up 20 times in the past one month. After the outbreak of Covid-19, we stocked up on these medicines, which is helping us now. But if the demand remains the same, it will certainly strain the supply chain.” On being asked about the efforts being put in to tide over the shortfall, assistant drug commissioner AK Jain said, “We are in touch with manufacturers and major suppliers to ensure adequate availability of IV fluids in the market. For now, all other drugs are available in the market. Officers are on alert. Strict action will be taken against those found involved in black marketing.” Meanwhile, at least three more children running high fever died in the past 24 hours in Firozabad district. Three others died in Etah, two in Agra, one Kasganj and one in Mainpuri. According to health department officials, so far, over 6,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra division. Out of these, around 4,900 were reported from Firozabad district alone, 650 from Mathura, 350 from Agra and 165 from Mainpuri. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus — a bacterial illness spread by larval mites, leptospirosis- bacterial disease spread through the urine of infected animals -- have also been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dengue-in-firozabad-chemists-run-out-of-intravenous-fluids-attendants-rush-to-delhi-to-get-saline-bags-return-empty-handed/articleshow/87090401.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Pune||Pune: Senior caste verification official caught taking bribe, Rs 1.28 crore found at residence||PUNE: The state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) recovered Rs1.28 crore in cash and documents of properties valued at Rs1.53 crore from the residence of the deputy commissioner for caste verification in Wanowrie, after arresting him on Saturday night on the charge of demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs1.9 lakh. On Sunday, an ACB team produced the deputy commissioner for caste verification Nitin Chandrakant Dhage, before a holiday court, which ordered his custodial remand till October 21. A woman, who wanted to contest a reserved seat in the gram panchayat at Mulshi taluka, had applied for a caste verification certificate. Her husband had been pursuing the matter with Dhage, who sits at the caste verification office in Yerawada. “Dhage initially sought Rs8 lakh for issuing the certificate,” an ACB officer said, and added that post-negotiation, he settled for Rs3 lakh and told the woman’s husband to bring Rs1.9 lakh as the first instalment to his residence. The woman’s husband then filed a complaint with the ACB and a trap was laid around Dhage’s residence around 10.30pm on Saturday. Additional SP (ACB) Suhas Nadgouda said, “The gram panchayat elections for the Mulshi village are scheduled for next year. The complainant wanted to get his wife’s OBC certificate verified by the caste verification committee. His application was pending before the committee for nine months. To issue the certificate, Dhage had demanded a bribe of Rs8 lakh”. “Dhage called the complainant to his home and told him to put the bag containing Rs1.9 lakh in the car’s boot. At this juncture, our team zeroed in on him,” he said. Nadgouda said during preliminary questioning, following the recovery of cash, Dhage maintained the cash did not belong to him. “We are questioning him over different angles related to the cash. An open inquiry too has been initiated against him and the same will determine if he has amassed movable and immovable properties disproportionate to his known sources of income.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/senior-caste-verification-official-caught-taking-bribe-rs-1-28cr-found-at-residence/articleshow/87092605.cms||Gitesh Shelke

On Sunday morning, the victim’s father said that he would take his son’s body for the last rites only after all the accused are arrested. Later, chaos prevailed when he threatened to immolate himself. DCP West and ACP Kalyanpur reached the spot with heavy police force and pacified the situation. To recall, Ajay (25), son of Shivanand Tiwari, a resident of Panki Ratanpur Colony, was beaten to death on Friday night. It was alleged that the accused had killed him when he refused to give them Rs 500 for consuming liquor. On the complaint of Shivanand, the police have registered an FIR against three to four people including Dharmendra Singh, Deepu Bhadauria and Sunil Chaturvedi under the sections of assault, rioting and murder. The accused, however, are still absconding. The relatives brought the body home after the autopsy on Saturday evening. On Sunday, Shivanand refused to perform the last rites, and demanded arrest of all the accused. A heavy police force was deployed outside Ajay’s house to avoid any untoward incident. Panki Inspector Dadhibal Tiwari said that the situation has been pacified and the family members have agreed to perform the last rites after assurance. They were told that separate police teams have been formed and raids are underway to arrest all the accused soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kin-of-man-beaten-to-death-stage-protest/articleshow/87090409.cms||---

---||Kochi||IMD forecasts more heavy rains in Kerala for 3-4 days from October 20||KOCHI: Though Saturday’s low-pressure area over southeast Arabian Sea & adjoining Kerala has become less marked, its remnants, now seen as a trough, continued to bring isolated heavy rainfall to many parts of the state on Sunday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s 24-hour rainfall data recorded from 8.30am on October 16 to 8.30am on October 17, Idukki and Kottayam received 31cm and 27cm of rainfall, respectively. Thrissur and Kollam received 17cm rainfall. Kozhikode (15cm), Kannur (15cm) Pathanamthitta (14cm), Ernakulam (13cm) and Palakkad (12cm) received heavy rainfalls. Aerial view of the landslide-hit area in Koottickal on SundayIMD’s director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra denied media reports that the extremely heavy rainfall was triggered by cloud burst events. He said there were two low pressure systems, one over the Bay of Bengal and the other over the Arabian Sea. There was some kind of interaction between these two low pressure systems, he said, adding that while one moved towards coastal Andhra and Telangana, the other approached Kerala coasts. These systems led to the strengthening of the southwest monsoon westerly winds, which moved into the Ghats regions resulting in extremely heavy rainfall of more than 20cm over Idukki, Kollam and Ernakulam,” he said. However, S Abhilash director of Cochin University’s Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research Director, remarked that there were several cloud formations over the state from Thiruvananthapuram to Kozhikode. “Some of them were overlapping,” he said. He said that data showed that in some places like Peermade, Chalakudy and Cheruthoni, there was a rainfall of 10-15cm between a span of two-three hours in the early morning hours on Saturday. “Our understanding in that such intense rainfall in a short span of time comes under a mesoscale mini-cloud burst event," he said. He said that more analysis will be done on the rainfall data during these days to understand if it was a mega cloud event, as it appears from the satellite images. IMD has forecast that a fresh spell of easterly wave is likely to affect south peninsular India from October 20 and cause fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls likely over Kerala for subsequent three-four days. It has sounded a yellow alert for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram for October 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/imd-forecasts-more-heavy-rains-for-3-4-days-from-oct-20/articleshow/87092678.cms||---

After the crash, the motorcycle skidded nearly 40 feet and soon caught fire. It also hit a scooter on which two sisters were travelling. Both women sustained injuries and were admitted to a nearby private hospital. The Nigdi police have identified the deceased as Aryan Narendra Parmar (24), a resident of Bopodi, and Shweta Ashok Gajbhiye (21), who was from Bhandara district and lived in Bopodi. “Aryan and Shweta were friends,” their friends told TOI. A food joint owner, who witnessed the crash, told TOI, “I heard a loud noise and rushed out. I saw the bike skidding along the BRTS route and catching fire. Two persons, including a young woman, were lying motionless on the road, while two other women too were lying on the road with their scooter some distance away.” “The man’s helmet lay a few metres away from the motorcycle. The impact of the crash was such that the concrete divider was also damaged,” he said. Assistant inspector Vijaykumar Dhumal of the Nigdi police said, “The sports bike was coming towards Nigdi via the grade separator at high speed. Parmar turned left to leave the grade separator and enter the service road after crossing the BRTS lane at Akurdi. He, however, hit the median. Due to the high speed, he and Gajbhiye were thrown into the air and fell on the road. Both died on the spot.” A doctor at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital in Pimpri said, “Parmar and Gajbhiye were brought dead to the hospital. Parmar died of head injuries and chest trauma while Gajbhiye succumbed to severe head injuries.” Parmar’s family friend Vijay told TOI, “Parmar, who lived with his parents, was doing an engineering course and was also working part time. Gajbhiye was a student.” Prince Salvi, a local resident, said the spot where the duo lost their lives was prone to accidents. “There is no issue of road engineering here, but people trying to enter the service lane from the wrong side cause problems to vehicles headed towards Nigdi via the grade separator,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-woman-friend-die-as-bike-hits-median-on-pune-mumbai-highway/articleshow/87092679.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Pune: Rain ruins coriander in fields, price soars to Rs 70 per bunch||PUNE: A bunch of coriander, used for its flavour in most Indian meals and a few sprigs of which were often added to the vegetable bag as a freebie after some haggling by most vendors till recently, has been bought for Rs 60 to Rs 70 in most neighbourhoods and markets across the city in the last few days. It now costs as much as one kg of good quality rice, three kg of potato or two kg of onion. In fact, the prices of all leafy vegetables, every day essentials for most households for their rich benefits, have increased in the retail markets in the city in the last 10 days. Like coriander, a bunch of fenugreek, spinach and dill too cost from Rs 15 to Rs 25. On Sunday, a bunch of coriander was auctioned at Rs 45 to Rs 50 at the Gultekdi Market Yard in the wholesale market. Officials at the Market Yard claimed that the recent rainfall across the district had badly affected the yield that is reaching the wholesale and the retail vegetable markets. Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section at the Market Yard, said, “The arrival of all vegetables, especially coriander is close to half the usual intake. We usually get 1.6 lakh bunches daily. Now, it has dropped to 86,000. As a result, the prices have increased. Coriander is usually used in large quantities in eateries, restaurants and hotels in the city. Since there is a high demand from the food industry, the prices are also high.” Leafy vegetables’ rates are often dynamic and they have almost no shelf life They begin wilting almost immediately after being harvested and their prices begin dropping as soon as their arrival increases in the market, some Agriculture Produce Market Committee officials said. Vilas Bhujbal, president of the commission agents’ association at Gultekdi Market Yard, said, “The rates of all leafy vegetables are likely to remain high at least for next one week. As these vegetables were sold cheaply in the markets in the last month, most farmers did not plant them. This is also among the reasons for less intake in the market.” Officials at Narayangaon APMC market, a prominent wholesale markets in the district, have recorded record-breaking rate for coriander. Sanjay Kale, chairman of the Narayangaon market, told TOI, “One bunch of coriander was auctioned at Rs 140, the highest rate so far here. We usually get a good quality of leafy vegetables from all tehsils of Pune district as well as from Ahmednagar and Nashik district. Currently, there is very little arrival of all leafy vegetables. Hence, we feel that the rates are likely to remain high for the next ten days.” Meanwhile, farmers said that very few growers will benefit from the high rates as there is less yield due to adverse weather conditions. Kailas Salunkhe, a farmer from Khed tehsil, said, “I could get only 500 bunches of coriander from 10kg seeds. Usually, we get over 4,000 bunches. Due to bad weather conditions and rainfall, the harvest has been poor. Only some lucky farmers will benefit even though the rates are really high now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rain-ruins-coriander-in-fields-price-soars-to-rs-70-per-bunch/articleshow/87092654.cms||---

In a session at the Times LitFest, the 34-year-old was in conversation with author Jyotsna Mohan and discussed his struggles with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression, his relationship with his father and the impact his parents’ divorce had on his life. “I’m definitely attracted to people who come from stability. Writing the book was a lonely experience, but I have loved the past few weeks of talking to people about it because I live for human connection,” he says. “That definitely stems from everything I went through, from the divorce to being an only child and being a part of a family, and then not being a part of a family.” While he has discussed his mental health with his father, it is not a conversation they have a lot, he said. “We don’t really speak about it. I have told him I go to therapy and he was happy that I had found my peace,” he said, adding that they have reached a point of acceptance of their differences and have mutual respect. His OCD, Mallya said, “destroyed me for years”. “You constantly live with this demon on your shoulder thinking if I put one foot out of place, something bad is going to happen to me,” he said, adding that writing the book triggered the condition, which led him to go to a psychiatrist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/having-ocd-is-like-living-with-a-demon-on-your-shoulder/articleshow/87092661.cms||---
---||Agra||Rs 25 lakh stolen from police station warehouse in Agra, 6 cops suspended||AGRA: Six cops were suspended for "negligence on duty" following a theft of Rs 25 lakh from the warehouse of Jagdishpura police station in Agra on Sunday. The incident took place early in the morning when the warehouse in-charge was at a tea shop and the thieves allegedly broke in, according to the police. An FIR has been registered against unidentified persons. Police are not ruling out an "inside job". At least eight to 10 cops remain on duty at the busy thana situated in a congested part of the city during regular hours, sources said. Two of the policemen were sleeping in a room next to the warehouse when the incident happened and the culprits were probably aware that Rs 24 lakh had been recovered in a robbery case on October 14 and kept in a safe box in the warehouse, the sources added. Interestingly, the thieves didn’t take away any arms, ammunition or gold jewellery kept in the warehouse. Speaking about the matter, ADG Agra zone Rajeev Krishna said, “The thieves had broken into the warehouse from the backyard. They took away Rs 24 lakh recently recovered in a robbery case and Rs 1 lakh related to other cases. We are working on the matter and trying to get back the stolen cash and arrest the culprits.” SSP Agra Muniraj G added, “Our primary investigation suggests the thieves broke open a gate that was not in regular use. CCTV cameras on the way to the thana are being thoroughly scanned. Role of our personnel is also being investigated in detail." The six cops who have been suspended include a station house officer, a sub-inspector, three constables and a clerk. A forensic team and a dog squad had been called in to assist the probe till the time of filing this report. Notably, seized case properties, including cash, are mainly kept in sealed store rooms called 'malkhanas' or warehouses inside police stations till the courts decide on the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rs-25l-stolen-from-police-station-warehouse-in-agra-6-cops-suspended/articleshow/87090484.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||World||Bill Clinton back home after hospitalization from infection||ORANGE, CALIFORNIA: Bill Clinton arrived Sunday at his home in New York to continue recovering from an infection that left him in treatment for six days at a Southern California hospital, officials said.  The former president left the University of California Irvine Medical Center around 8 a.m. with Hillary Clinton on his arm. Dressed in jeans and a sports coat and wearing a face mask, he made his way out of the hospital slowly and stopped to shake hands with doctors and nurses lined up on the sidewalk.  He gave a thumbs-up when a reporter asked how he was feeling, and he and Hillary Clinton then boarded a black SUV. They departed in a motorcade escorted by the California Highway Patrol and headed to the airport.  Bill Clinton's "fever and white blood cell count are normalized, and he will return home to New York to finish his course of antibiotics," Dr. Alpesh N. Amin said in a statement shared on Twitter by a Clinton spokesman.  Clinton, 75, was admitted Tuesday to the hospital southeast of Los Angeles with an infection unrelated to COVID-19. He arrived Sunday evening at his home in Chappaqua, New York, to continue his recovery.  Spokesman Angel Urena had said Saturday that Clinton would remain hospitalized until at least Sunday to receive further intravenous antibiotics. But all health indicators were "trending in the right direction," Urena said.  Hillary Clinton had been with her husband at the hospital and was accompanied there Saturday by daughter Chelsea.  President Joe Biden said Friday night that he had spoken to Bill Clinton, and the former president "sends his best."  "He's doing fine; he really is," Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut.  An aide to the former president said Bill Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream but was on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.  The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn't used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn't receiving ICU care.  In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.  He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.  Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband - by then a grandfather and nearing 70 - returned to the campaign trail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bill-clinton-back-home-after-hospitalization-from-infection/articleshow/87096546.cms||---

---||Varanasi||‘International flights to Kushinagar will prove a game changer for east UP’||GORAKHPUR: A wave of happiness is sweeping across Kushinagar over the upcoming inauguration of the international airport by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 20 as the people expect a huge uptick in tourism and their earnings. Kushinagar is the Mahaparinirvan sthali of Lord Buddha. By providing international air connectivity, Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has made Kushinagar easily accessible for Buddhist pilgrims across the world. Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa will be aboard the first international flight landing at Kushinagar airport from Sri Lanka. Besides, 25 representatives and 100 Buddhist pilgrims will also arrive in the same flight. Many VVIPs and diplomats will also attend the inauguration. International air connectivity will boost tourism which will pave way for employment generation, development and investments, said locals. “Kushinagar International Airport has the longest runway of 3.2km length in the state and is 45m wide. The airport has the capacity for four arrivals and four departures of flights per hour. It also has a 3,600 square metre interim passenger building and arrangements are being made to make night flights also possible. “The Uttar Pradesh government had signed an MoU with the Airport Authority of India on March 5, 2019. On October 4, 2019, the state government handed over the airport to the Airport authority. On the initiative of the state government, the Union cabinet declared it as an international airport on June 24, 2020, and the DGCA gave it licence on February 22, 2021,” said Kushinagar Airport director AK Dwivedi. The international air connectivity will give a big boost to tourism as Buddhist pilgrims and tourists from Sri Lanka, Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam will be able to reach Kushinagar directly. They will also cover the Buddha circuit, including Lumbini, Bodh Gaya and Sarnath, said Kushinagar MLA Rajnikant Mani. “CM Yogi has been laying stress on tourism development and as per immigration bureau records, 42.17 lakh tourists visited Kushinagar from 18 Buddhist countries in the last five years. After international air connectivity, tourism will increase by 20%,” he added. Anuj Srivastav, a research scholar at DDU Gorakhpur University, said CM Yogi’s focus on international air connectivity will prove to be a gamechanger for east UP. Gorakhpur is already connected with eight major cities by air and Uttar Pradesh has a strong network of roads. The region will certainly attract huge investment as a result, he added. “The tourism boost will increase earnings of hotels, restaurants, travel agencies, guides and other service providers. Famous local products like terracotta, kalanamak rice, banana fibre products will get global recognition and market,” he said. “Earlier, Kushinagar used to be in the news for malnutrition deaths in Musahar community, none were reported in the last 4.5 years,” said Sangita Jaiswal, a teacher. Now, Musahars have pucca houses, electricity and get free ration. The CM gave Rs 421 crore development projects to the district last month, she added. “Encephalitis was a major problem in Kushinagar and resulted in many casualties, but it is not so now. We are getting a medical college here so patients will not have to run to Gorakhpur. We have oxygen plants in CHCs and PHCs. There has been a revolution in healthcare in the district,” said Dr Asma Rizwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/intl-flights-to-kushinagar-will-prove-a-gamechanger-for-east-up/articleshow/87090551.cms||---

After inaugurating a 15-day exhibition of Khadi products organized by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) at Rudraksh international convention centre, Verma was addressing a convention of artisans from 12 districts of east UP on Sunday. Lauding KVIC for organizing the exhibition and holding convention of artisans he said, “Varanasi, in the past few years, has emerged as a hub of various Khadi activities. Almost all rural and traditional arts like spinning, weaving, beekeeping and pottery have been promoted on a large scale here.” These initiatives are creating self-employment for the artisans and making them 'atmanirbhar' (self-reliant), said Verma adding, this Khadi exhibition will also provide a big platform to the artisans to market their products and enhance their income. In his address KVIC Chairman VK Saxena said that the state level Khadi exhibition at Varanasi was a manifestation of Khadi artisans’ commitment for Atmanirbhar Bharat. “KVIC has set up a large number of Khadi Institutions, PM Employment Generation Program units and Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) clusters to strengthen the traditional arts and empower the local artisans. This exhibition is a unique platform where people in Varanasi and adjoining areas can buy handmade khadi products from states like J&K, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and others. This will be a big boost for the ‘vocal for local’ initiative and also promote khadi,” Saxena said. Varanasi, which is also the parliamentary constituency of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has rolled out a number of activities to promote khadi and support the artisans, he said, adding that as any as 134 Khadi Institutions are currently working in Varanasi where women comprise nearly 80% of the total workforce. According to Saxena, the artisans convention was aimed at enabling them to exchange views on their products and benefits they are availing with the schemes of KVIC in order to work for popularizing them more. A state of the art Khadi exhibition is displaying the exquisite handcrafted products from 20 Indian states including UP, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Leh-Ladakh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Bihar, West Bengal and others at 105 stalls.

Common kitchen ingredients such as tomato and onion are selling for Rs 60 and Rs 45 per kg, respectively. This is as opposed to these being sold for Rs 30 and Ra 25 per kg, respectively, two weeks ago. Coriander was selling at Rs 15 per bunch until some days ago. “Our clients have started purchasing the items in smaller quantities to make do with the inflation. However, those celebrating Eid (on Tuesday) have been hit the hardest since tomatoes, onion and coriander are requisite ingredients in biryani,” a vegetable vendor at the Panaji market, Noorahmad Rumalwale, said. Suppliers from Belagavi have not only the heavy rains to blame for spoilage of the crops, but even the damp weather that has been causing moisture incursion in fresh vegetables during transit. “The consistently heavy rain in Belagavi was unexpected and has destroyed the onion crop thereby creating the shortage. But due to humidity, there is fungus risk to the crops. Even though we send fresh produce from Belagavi, due to climate change, by the time trucks reach Goa, the quality is affected,” vegetable supplier Vineet Bichu said. In addition, there is serious shortage of vegetables in parts of Maharashtra as well, owing to which traders from there have turned to Belagavi as well to source their edible greens. “The quality of stored onions in Maharashtra have been affected by the rain. There are agents from Mumbai that are picking up vegetables in bulk from the Belagavi market to supply in their markets. There is very little left to send to Goa as a result,” another vendor said. Suppliers are of the opinion that it may take another month or so, for the fresh crop to be harvested and prices to normalise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unseasonal-rain-leads-to-rise-in-vegetable-prices/articleshow/87094707.cms||Nida Sayed

The officials have decided to intensify action against sweet shops, which are not following mandatory norm of displaying ‘Best before date’ for loose sweets kept for sale. “We have started drawing samples mainly of khoya and its cheaper and banned version. Besides, adulteration in edible oil and jaggery are also on our radar this Diwali,” said Shivaji Desai, joint commissioner (food), FDA, Pune. The FDA’s focus is to ensure that food quality is not compromised during the festive period. “As part of the special drive, raids are being conducted across the city to prevent the sale of substandard, adulterated, and poor-quality food items,” Desai said. He said the distributor from neighbouring states supply sweet khoya to shops mainly in the rural parts of Pune, Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad. “These shops would sell it either independently or in the form of special barfi to consumers,” Desai said. FDA officials have initiated fine imposition and adjudication process against 103 sweet shops in Pune for not displaying the best before date for loose sweets recently during Ganesh festival and Navaratra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khoya-edible-oil-jaggery-under-fdas-scanner/articleshow/87092680.cms||Umesh Isalkar

It also helped in reducing the air pollution level. Agriculture department officials claimed that the drizzling will be beneficial for the mustard crop. According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of rainfall and thundershowers for the next two days. As compared to 36.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday, rainfall on Sunday resulted in maximum temperature to drop to 29.9 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, the air quality (AQI) index in Agra was recorded at 178 or ‘moderate’ category, by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to the weathermen report, with one or two spells of rainfall, the minimum temperature is expected to decrease by 4 degree Celsius next week. Agra chief medical officer AK Srivastava said, “There is a surge in patients of fever and diarrhea coming to government hospitals. Changing weather conditions require some basic precautions to stay fit. These precautions include a balanced diet, proper water intake and maintenance of hygiene.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra plans to hold statewide sero survey||MUMBAI: The state health department wants to conduct a statewide sero survey to check the level of antibodies to Covid-19 in various districts and groups. State health minister Rajesh Tope said he will seek the chief minister’s permission to conduct a sero survey across all 36 districts. There have been sero surveys in different cities, including Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, but a pan-state sero survey hasn’t taken place in Maharashtra. Mumbai has conducted five sero surveys so far. “Kerala just completed a statewide survey that showed high levels of antibodies in various groups and districts and I would suggest Maharashtra to undertake a similar exercise,” said Tope. The Kerala sero survey showed that 82.6% of the surveyed people — from children, adults, pregnant women and tribal community — had antibodies as against 42.2% during the sero survey done in May. “We need to collect a big sample from each district for the survey,” said Tope. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s task force on Covid-19, said a statewide survey would help understand the level of immunity against Delta. “Despite the opening up of services and increased socialisation, we have not seen an exponential rise in cases in Mumbai. We need to understand if this is due to vaccination alone or Delta immunity,” said Dr Joshi, adding that a statewide genome survey should also be done. Senior government officials said that a pan-state sero survey will also help understand the exposure levels in different kinds of population and plan the vaccination strategy accordingly. “At the moment, the vaccine distribution is being done based on the population and also more doses are being given to districts that are at the bottom in terms of population covered. Sero survey will help us re-focus our vaccination strategy,” said an official. A senior doctor said sero surveys should be planned scientifically. “Ideally, we should take 1 sample per 1,000 population. But that would be too huge an exercise to be carried out,” said the doctor, adding that surveys with fewer participants don’t always give the correct picture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-plans-to-hold-statewide-sero-survey/articleshow/87095324.cms||Malathy Iyer

The civic body took 18 hours to plug the leak, as staff worked right through the festivities. “There is a 600-mm pipeline at Mehboob Studio, near Bandra Reclamation inlet of Pali reservoir. Thousands of litres of water were being wasted due to the leak. It was difficult to find the fissure, but the leak detection team accurately detected it 12 feet deep, with the help of modern equipment. There is a network of high-pressure cables below the road, so excavation was done very carefully,” said an official. Two fissures were found at the bottom, and closed by applying steel patch welding and tailpiece.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-plugs-leak-sans-water-cut-on-dussehra/articleshow/87092739.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Dehradun||CAU officials allege ‘malpractices’ by senior officials, demand resignation of association’s prez and secy||Dehradun: Several office bearers of the Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU) have issued open letters demanding the resignation of the association's president, Jot Singh Gunsola, and secretary, Mahim Verma. The association's vice-president Sanjay Rawat has claimed that the top office bearers should step down as the association has been involved in unethical practices. Speaking to TOI, he said, “There is no transparency in the daily affairs of the association and most of the office-bearers aren’t kept in the loop. The secretary is taking all the decisions without consulting us. We have written around 10 letters raising our grievances but no step has been taken so far to address our concerns.” Sanjay Rawat, who is the nephew of former state chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, pointed out that the cricket association has been embroiled in controversies for the last two years. “Wasim Jaffer’s unceremonious exit was unfortunate. He would have surely done a good job as the head coach of the Uttarakhand men’s cricket team. How can someone accuse a legend like Jaffer of being a communal bigot? Besides, it has also come to our notice that a few players were selected through ‘sources’ in CAU-run cricket teams,” he added. Rawat also alleged that the selection trial camps are not being conducted properly. Reacting to the allegations, a senior official of the CAU said that aggrieved office-bearers can discuss their concerns with the members of the association. Earlier this month, Kulbeer Rawat, coach of a Dehradun-based cricket academy, was arrested by Gurgaon Police for duping players under the pretext of getting them selected in state cricket teams.  During interrogation, Kulbeer, who worked for a company called ‘Secure Corporate Management’, also mentioned the names of some CAU officials, according to Gurgaon Police. “We are still investigating and trying to trace the footprint of the gang, to which Kulbeer Rawat belonged, across the country,” said Umesh Kumar, sub-inspector, Gurgaon Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cau-officials-allege-malpractices-by-senior-officials-demand-resignation-of-associations-prez-and-secy/articleshow/87090631.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Madurai||Man acquitted of murder as wife’s dying declarations not consistent: Madras HC||MADURAI: Taking into account the inconsistency in five different dying declarations given by a woman, Madras high court acquitted a man who was accused of murdering his wife by setting her on fire in Kanyakumari in 2011. The prosecution case was that accused Shakul Hameed and his wife Fathima had a quarrel on July 25, 2011 when he poured kerosene on her and set her afire causing severe injuries leading to her death in hospital on November 13. The couple had three children. Thuckalay police registered a case against Hameed and in 2018, the Kanyakumari fast track mahila court convicted and sentenced him to undergo life imprisonment for offence under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. Challenging his conviction, he had filed the criminal appeal before HC Madurai bench. A division bench of Justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu observed that there are five dying declarations in the case. In the first one given to a private hospital doctor, Fathima said her husband poured kerosene on her and set her afire. In her second one given to a doctor at a government hospital where she was referred to she stated that she sustained injuries as a kerosene can fell on her. The same day she was shifted to a hospital at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, where a third dying declaration was given to the judicial magistrate. She had then stated that she became unconscious as her husband had assaulted her over a quarrel. When she regained consciousness, she noticed that her body was on fire. Immediately, her husband had poured water on her and neighbours taken her to the hospital. Though she stated that her husband was alone in the house, she said that she was not aware as to who poured the kerosene. In the fourth dying declaration given to the police, she said her husband set her on fire while her neighbours doused it and took her to hospital. In the fifth declaration given to police while at the government hospital, she had stated that while she was preparing hot water, a kerosene can fell down and caught fire on her dress. “It is the settled law that a dying declaration recorded by a competent judicial magistrate would stand on much higher footing than a declaration recorded by any other officer. The reason being, the magistrate has no axe to grind against the person named in the dying declaration,” observed the judges. They further said that the presence of her minor daughter at the time of occurrence was doubtful as she had gone to the school and then to the tuition centre. If the child was at the house at the time of occurrence, there is no chance for her to go to school after the incident. The judges observed that it would be unsafe to convict the appellant due to the inconsistency in the dying declarations and doubtful testimony of the minor child. Hence, the judges set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court and acquitted the appellant of all charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-acquitted-of-murder-as-wifes-dying-declarations-not-consistent/articleshow/87092748.cms||Kaushik Kannan

There were around 15 houses on the hill side and most of them were residing there for years in harmony. Jobin Joseph, a resident, remembered the happy moments they had at the function. Roshini was among the dead in the landslide. “I heard a big sound and felt a vibration after 11:30am. When I came out of my house, I saw the gushing water passing through the centre of the settlement. One house was totally washed away and one partially. A grocery-cum-tea shop down the lane was also washed away,” said Joseph, 38, a farmer. Joseph and two others immediately moved down and at some places crawled through the sides of the slush, hoping to save anyone alive. “As we were moving down, we saw a body without a head and further down saw an arm separated from the body,” he added. hile shifting his family to a relief camp in the evening, Joseph’s eldest son, aged seven, was bit by a snake and he had to rush his son to the medical college hospital in Kottayam. Thomas Pulikkal, a resident of Kavali, where a whole family was washed away in the landslide, said that the vicar of the church in Kavali had telephoned them on Saturday morning and asked the residents there to come and stay in the parish hall as it was raining incessantly. “I discussed this with Martin’s family who were my immediate neighbours. His eldest daughter, Sneha, said that nothing would happen and that they would remain in their house,” said Pulikkal, 67, a rubber tapper. On hearing a thunder-like sound, Pulikkal came out of his house and saw the gushing waters, and realised that his neighbouring house was washed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-day-before-tragedy-baptism-at-koottickal/articleshow/87092799.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Madurai||In rape case, Madras HC asks man to pay relief for kid he fathered||MADURAI: Partly allowing an appeal preferred by a man against his conviction and sentence by the trial court in a case where he had refused to marry a woman after impregnating her, Madras high court directed him to pay Rs 5 lakh compensation to the child born out of the relationship, observing that it was the real victim in the case. According to the prosecution, M Malaisamy of Ramanathapuram had promised to marry a woman he was in love with in his village and they had a physical relationship. However, after the woman became pregnant, he refused to marry her prompting her to lodge a complaint against him and a case was registered against him. In 2015, the trial court at Ramanathapuram convicted and sentenced the man to undergo 10 years imprisonment for sexual assault under Section 376 of IPC and one-year imprisonment for cheating under Section 417 of IPC. Malaisamy challenged this through the present appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2015. Justice R Pongiappan observed that it is seen that the appellant and the woman were in a relationship. The woman had consented for physical relationship with the appellant. Since the relationship was consensual, the accused need not be convicted for sexual assault. However, the judge observed that the act of the appellant who had refused to marry the woman after impregnating her would definitely come under the purview of cheating. Hence, the judge convicted and sentenced the appellant to undergo one-year imprisonment for cheating. The judge further observed that due to the act committed by the appellant and the woman, the child had lost the status of being a legitimate child. Observing that the real victim in this case was the child , the judge directed the man to pay Rs 5lakh relief to the child. The woman could withdraw the accrued interest once in 3 months and utilize it for the welfare of the child, said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-asked-to-pay-relief-to-child-born-out-of-relationship/articleshow/87092767.cms||---

This would be a significant step the company is taking towards the concept, something top boss Mark Zuckerberg has touted in recent months.  In September, Facebook committed $50 million towards building the metaverse, where companies like Roblox Corp and "Fortnite" maker Epic Games have an early foothold.  The company earlier launched a test of a new virtual-reality remote work app where users of the company's Oculus Quest 2 headsets can hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves.  Facebook also said in July it was creating a product team to work on the metaverse which would be part of Facebook Reality Labs, its augmented reality and virtual reality group.  "This investment (in new jobs) is a vote of confidence in the strength of the European tech industry and the potential of European tech talent," the company said.  "Europe is hugely important to Facebook."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebook-plans-to-hire-10000-in-eu-to-build-metaverse/articleshow/87096550.cms||---
---||Madurai||HC sets aside punishment for cop, orders promotion||Madurai: Observing that great care should be taken by authorities while initiating disciplinary proceedings against a government employee based on the criminal complaint lodged by family members, Madras high court set aside the punishment of ‘black mark’ imposed on a police constable and directed the authorities to promote him to the post of head constable. Petitioner P Deenadayalan was appointed as grade II police constable in 1999 and promoted as grade I police constable in 2010. In 2008, a charge-memo was issued to him after he was arrested in connection with a criminal case lodged by his ex-wife for dowry harassment. After an inquiry, a punishment of increment postponement for one year without cumulative effect was imposed on him. Though he filed an appeal, it was rejected. Meanwhile, in 2010, a trial court acquitted him of criminal charges. However, when the petitioner filed a revision petition, the authorities modified the punishment to ‘black mark’. His subsequent mercy petition was also rejected by the home department. The petitioner had filed the present petition before HC Madurai bench in 2014, challenging the orders and also seeking a direction to promote him as head constable from the date on which his immediate junior was promoted. Justice S S Sundar took note of the fact that the petitioner’s wife had lodged a criminal complaint against him immediately after he filed for divorce. Departmental action was initiated against the petitioner in this case only on the basis of criminal complaint. Therefore, the authorities cannot ignore the petitioner’s acquittal by the criminal court after a full-fledged trial. The judge observed that the findings during departmental action cannot be based on surmises and conjectures when the misconduct is not in connection with employment. Hence the judge set aside the punishment of ‘black mark’ and directed the authorities to promote the petitioner as head constable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-punishment-for-cop-orders-promotion/articleshow/87092779.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Unless he is recalling the national animals of countries around the world. Swaraj, a 4th standard student of the Chinmaya Vidyalaya in Boisar has got into the India Book of Records--a private curator of record creators by Indians —for recalling the national animals of a maximum number of countries in one minute. Swaraj, achieved the feat of recalling the national animals of 55 countries, a day after turning nine on August 15, 2021. He is the only person in the India Book of Records history to create the record and is readying to make it to the Guinness Book of World Records. “I have already improved my performance. I can now recite the names of 55 animals in 54 seconds as against my record of 60 seconds,” said Swaraj, giving away a brief introduction of his skills over telephone.

Speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations of the party at the Amma temple in Kunnathur on Sunday, he said AIADMK had secured 1.43 crore votes in the assembly elections, something no opposition party in the state had secured till date. ``We continue to serve the people to the fullest even as an opposition party,’’ he said. Senior members of the party were honoured with shawls while cadres paid respects to leaders MGR and J Jayalalithaa and garlanded their statues on the occasion. Annadhanam was organized as part of the celebrations which saw Udhayakumar also participating in the cooking. He urged party cadres to take a pledge to reap victories in all elections.

---||Pune||Brigadier-rank officer posted in Shimla booked for Lt Col’s suicide: Pune police||PUNE: The city police on Saturday evening registered a case of abetment to suicide against a brigadier-rank officer, posted at headquarters, Army Training Command (ARTRAC), Shimla, in connection with the death of a woman lieutenant colonel on October 13 at the Military Intelligence Training School & Depot (MITSD) here. The woman officer, posted in Jaipur, was in Pune since July 12 for her six-month training course at the MITSD. The police registered the FIR after the woman’s husband, a colonel posted in Jaipur, lodged a complaint on October 16 accusing the brigadier of having an extra-marital affair with his wife and “harassing and blackmailing” by threatening to make their intimate photos and videos public. The colonel said in a statement recorded with the police that he and his wife’s plea for divorce by mutual consent is pending before a family court in Jaipur after she told him in May this year that the brigadier was going to divorce his wife and marry her. Deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI on Sunday, “For now, we have registered a case under section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC. Based on the outcome of our ongoing investigations, will take a call on adding other charges.” When contacted, the colonel told TOI, “This is not an appropriate time for me to speak on the matter.” In a brief response to TOI’s text sent on a social messaging app, the brigadier said this was “a false implication against me”. The Indian Army’s spokesman Colonel Sudhir Chamoli told TOI over the phone on Sunday, “We cannot comment on the matter as we are not aware of the case. You can send a query to us and the Southern Command.” TOI’s queries sent to the defence public relations officer, for a comment from the Southern Command, and to the Army Headquarters did not get any response till the time of this writing. In his statement, the colonel said he had noticed that his wife appeared to be under stress when they moved to Jaipur in 2020. Her father had died in 2019. This May, she told him that after her father’s death and while he was posted in Mhow for a course, the brigadier — her immediate superior — “took advantage of her loneliness on the pretext of giving her mental and emotional support and further developed a physical relationship”. He took photos and videos while they were intimate and “later started harassing and blackmailing her”, the complainant said. The colonel also said that during conversations over the phone, while his wife was undergoing training at MITSD, she repeatedly told him that she was frustrated with the brigadier’s harassment, which she claimed was the cause behind her hypertension. A former brigadier and deputy judge advocate general with the Southern Command told TOI, “The Army will have to issue a court of inquiry by a panel under the Army Act, 1950, in this case to verify and establish the allegations made by the colonel against the brigadier. Following this inquiry, the panel may add charges. Since the woman officer died at a Category ‘A’ training establishment, the local Army authorities (in this case, the Southern Command) will have to order an inquiry. Also, the two officers (the complaining colonel and the brigadier) are posted at two different locations. They will have to be attached to units in Pune on temporary duty to enable the panel to conduct||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/abetment-case-against-brig-for-lt-cols-suicide/articleshow/87092828.cms||Sandip Dighe

N K Arora, who heads the Covid-19 working group of the Centre’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) told TOI on Sunday that in addition to the Covishield-Covaxin trials currently under way at Christian Medical College in Vellore, more studies involving vaccines or different platforms could be necessary. “The idea is to find the best possible combination that will not only improve the degree of protection, but also is safe and extends the durability of protection against Covid-19,” Arora said. The mix-and-match method created a buzz in India an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) analysis of the “serendipitous” mix of Covishield and Covaxin in Uttar Pradesh found the combination not only safe, but also eliciting a more potent immune response. This was in addition to several other studies on different vaccine combinations across the world. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel has recently warned that such studies require cautious interpretation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-vaccine-cocktail-trials-needed-says-ntagi-chief/articleshow/87095345.cms||Umesh Isalkar

President of Travel Club, Madurai, G Ravindran says they expect the demand for global tourism to pick up in another six months. ``People in Madurai and southern districts who go on annual vacations take time to decide on travel unlike those in bigger cities who are more frequent travellers,’’ he said. However, many are facing issues with accommodation while travelling on tour packages to north Indian destinations, as many hotels were not maintained during the lockdown, he said. Tour operators are now sending some of their workers in advance to check lodging facilities for tourists on package tours as a caution. Tour agents say they usually get good bookings for local tourism during the pilgrimage season, but that too has not picked up yet. ``In pre-covid times, we would have our vehicles booked in advance for over a month during the Sabarimala season, but this year, there has not been bulk bookings yet,’’ said K Kannan, a tour operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/domestic-travel-from-south-tn-picking-up/articleshow/87092856.cms||---

Sundaram S, a villager, says that earlier they faced a lot of problems. There were incidents of people from other communities not permitting dalits to use public roads to carry their dead people. “We had to wade through knee deep water in the village tank to reach the crematorium about half a kilometer away,” he said. There are more than 500 families living in the village, of which around 200 families are Adi dravidars. The other families include kallar, chettiars and others. Panchayat president of Thummakundu M O Perumal said that this was a poll promise that he gave the community during the elections two years ago. “I started exploring ways of fulfilling the promise, but there was no land available. Then two villagers, Saraswathy and her husband Chinnasamy, both from the community, came forward to donate 12 cents of land near the other crematorium,” he said. It was constructed at a cost of Rs 9.70 lakh and completed about a week ago. Other communities in the village have also welcomed the construction of the crematorium. Earlier, the adi dravidars had to cremate their dear ones on the banks of a local tank, and it was a difficult task during the rainy season. Now, our elders would get a decent funeral, say members of the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/after-75-years-of-struggle-dalits-get-a-crematorium/articleshow/87092837.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Voyaging 3,700km from Siberia, winged guests arrive at Asan||Dehradun: Keeping their date with Uttarakhand's Asan, a flock of Ruddy Shelducks flew 3,700km from Siberia to reach its all-time favourite winter destination. For the next six months, the winged creatures will be making most of the sunshine at this Ramsar site. The arrangements to welcome the annual guests from Russia to Asan - the country’s first wetland conservation reserve on the outskirts of Dehradun - had commenced almost a fortnight ago. Frontline workers deployed at this wetland have made several mudflats for the birds and water quality is in check. Measures have also been taken to prevent any poaching activity in the Asan wetland, spanning across 444 hectares. Every year Asan hosts at least 36 migratory bird species in thousands from different parts of the world. The reserve turns into a hue of colours with its presence. “Ruddy Shelduck marks its entry in Asan on October 7-8th every year. It marks the beginning of the winter here. This year, too, they touched down on October 8 followed by other migratory birds. Now, the wetland will be gradually full of all these winged guests,” said Pradeep Saxena, forester, Asan Conservation Reserve, who oversees Asan wetland for over five years now. Migratory birds like Northern Shoveler from Eurasia and Eurasian Coot from China have also started arriving from Sunday. Asan is situated on the confluence of the Eastern Yamuna canal and the Asan river, which originated at Chandrabani in the foothills of the Shivalik hills. Almost 40km downstream, it merges with the Yamuna river. According to Rajendra Hingwan, range officer of ACR, for two years the bird festival was not held due to Covid-19. This year, there is a high probability of conducting a grand bird fest after Asan received its Ramsar tag - a first for Uttarakhand - the previous year, he said. He added that Red-crested Pochard, Eurasian Wigeons, Tufted Pochard, Great Cormorant, Little Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe, Bar-headed Goose, Asian Openbill Stork are the regular visitors. The Zoological Survey of India in its 2013 report had also ascertained the richness of this wetland by stating that it has a presence of 78 species of invertebrates, 40 species of fishes, 20 mammal species, four amphibians and one reptile, according to the forest authorities. The birds from different parts of the world visit this conservation site during winters as their breeding sites get frozen in their native places. In search of food and comfortable living conditions, they fly down to this part of the world and remain here from October till March-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/voyaging-3700km-from-siberia-winged-guests-arrive-at-asan/articleshow/87090694.cms||Shivani Azad

During the butterfly census and orientation programme for children, 40 species of butterflies were spotted at the tank on Saturday alone. In the past, 21 other butterfly species were sighted at the tank, which is a significant ecological spot. At least 30 children were involved in the census that was organized by the Nature and Butterfly Society (TNBS). The census was held at the plantation that was raised by Kovai Kulangal Padhukappu Amaippu, a voluntary organization working on restoring wetlands in the district, on the tank bund. A six-member TNBS team led by its president A Pavendhan had created awareness among the children on the life cycle of butterflies and their significance in the ecosystem, before taking them for the survey. Experts said sighting 40 butterfly species on a single day was significant for a wetland. They said a few interesting species were also sighted during the census. Pavendhan said, “Bamboo treebrown was one of the species spotted during the survey. It is mostly found in forests. The Miyawaki forest on the tank bund houses bamboo plants, which is the host plant for bamboo treebrown butterflies. This is one of the reasons for the butterfly species to thrive there.” Blue mormon butterflies, which are predominantly found in forests and rural landscape, were also sighted in large numbers at the Vellalore tank. It’s the state butterfly of Maharashtra. Common banded peacock and apefly butterfly species were also sighted during the survey. Spread across 90 acres, Vellalore tank was a dryland for a few years, before it received water in 2017 following the combined efforts of the city corporation, NGOs and the district administration. As part of the tank restoration, Miyawaki forest was raised on its bund for nearly 100 metres with 8,000 trees of 270 species, including 60 herbal and flowering plants. “It created a conducive ecosystem for butterflies to thrive,” said R Manikandan, coordinator, Kovai Kulangal Padhukappu Amaippu. He said they were planning to have a monthly butterfly survey at the tank. “It will help document the butterfly species found at the tank and school students could learn about them.” Pavendan, meanwhile, said the long tank bund was an advantage to grow vegetation and the ecosystem must have more than 100 butterfly species. “It has the potential to qualify as the city’s butterfly hotspot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vellalore-tank-is-citys-new-budding-butterfly-hotspot/articleshow/87092894.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A recent survey had revealed that around 8.4 ha in the Majiwada-Manpada administrative ward was required for access to the Thane-Borivli road, while another 25.6 ha was required for the underground tunnel link. A proposal has been moved before the Thane general body for changing the current reservation on the lands, explained officials. A majority of the land is currently reserved for a botanical and zoological park, Thane transport depot and road development plan. There are also a few residential patches and a green zone in Borivade that will need to be altered to suit the project. It may be recalled that a study of the possible entry-exit points for the six-lane highway was conducted a few months ago by multiple agencies, including the MMRDA, and is now being executed after it was handed over from the MSRDC recently. Officials had then said that they were working on ensuring minimal disturbance to residential and green zones along the stretch. As per initial plans, the highway, along with its 11-km-long tunnel, will connect Thane at Manpada and Borivli near the Magathane BEST depot, drastically cutting down travel time. The tunnels will be drilled under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park using tunnel boring machines. Each of the two tunnels will have three lanes for traffic and one for pedestrians. The estimated cost of the project is approximately over Rs 10,000 crore. Presently, the route along Ghodbunder road is circuitous and takes at least two hours one way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-thane-borivli-twin-tunnel-project-makes-headway/articleshow/87092909.cms||Manoj Badgeri

They have been quarantined and their condition is being monitored constantly by a medical team, according to school officials. The authorities of the premier residential school told TOI that these students had come with a negative RT-PCR report in the second week of October. At the school entrance, they underwent a rapid antigen test. This was followed by a mandatory quarantine. On the third day of the quarantine, they displayed mild symptoms and were quickly isolated. Their immediate contacts – eight students – have also been moved to a Covid-19 facility on the campus. In a press statement released on Sunday, The Doon School administration stated, “These students (those found infected and the ones who came in their contact) continue to reside in a separate and well-equipped Covid quarantine facility that has all the safety protocols in place. The facility has been created to handle such exigencies.” The infected students are asymptomatic and continue to take their classes virtually, according to the school’s communique. “At present, they are asymptomatic and under 24x7 care of our nursing staff. Their parents have been apprised of the situation and we are continuously coordinating with the district health authorities,” added the statement. One of the senior officials of the school told TOI that the students are being quarantined based on the region they come from. “This is a very localised spread, so if a group of our boys comes from Maharashtra, we quarantine them together. The norms are to quarantine the children region-wise,” the official said. As per authorities, the school has been receiving students in a staggered manner since the last week of August while following all Covid-19 protocols. In addition, the staff is also adhering to the internal SOPs of the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/four-students-of-the-doon-school-test-covid-positive-put-under-isolation/articleshow/87090740.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Mumbai||Mhada gives affordable housing, entitled to tax relief: ITAT||MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in its recent order has held that Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) is entitled to income tax (I-T) exemption, as its activities are charitable in nature. Mhada, a statutory housi-ng authority engaged in providing affordable housing, had appealed to the ITAT as it was denied tax exemption for 2014-15. In its order, dated October 13, the tax tribunal bench relied on an earlier order on the same issue for 2009-10, which was in Mhada’s favour. If a registered non-profit entity is engaged in charitable activities, its income is exempt under Section 11 of the I-T Act. According to Section 2(15), the term ‘charitable’ purpose includes ‘advancement of any other object of general public utility’. A proviso to this section, introduced from April 1, 2009, provides that this definition no longer holds good, if the non-profit entity carries on any activity or provides any service in the nature of trade commerce or business for a consideration. But, certain exceptions are carved out, if such activities are undertaken in the course of carrying out its main objectives; or if the receipts from such activities do not exceed the stipulated amount in a financial year, then the terms of Section 2(15) are not violated. In such cases, the non-profit entity is entitled to I-T exemption under Section 11. In Mhada’s case, the I-T off-icer denied the tax exemption it had claimed for 2014-15 under Section 11, based on his reading of the proviso to Section 2(15). The ITAT bench, comprising judicial member Saktijit Dey and accountant member Rajesh Kumar, referred to the earlier ITAT order which had stated: “Whether an activity construes business or is in the nature of business is largely dependent upon the fact of wh-ether such activity is actuated by profit motive or not. Merely because Mhada builds tenements and sells them does not lead to any inference that its activities are in the nature of trade, commerce or business.” The bench followed the earlier decision and set aside the order of the commissioner (Appeals), which was in favour of the tax department, and held that Mhada would be allowed tax exemption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/itat-mhada-gives-affordable-housing-entitled-to-tax-relief-in-mumbai/articleshow/87093002.cms||Lubna Kably

Mishra, who is himself an accused in an FIR registered by farmers, added, "Farmers were allowed to take over a road and then the route was not barricaded by police. Shyam Sundar Nishad, one of the workers, was alive with police and had reached an ambulance but was dragged out and killed. The guilty cops will not be spared and the government will conduct a probe against them. The government has given a free hand to the investigating agency." The Thar jeep (the first vehicle in the killer convoy) was registered in the minister's name. His son Ashish, a key accused, is already under arrest and is being interrogated. In all, six men have been arrested till now in the case. Shyam Sundar’s brother Sanjeev Nishad, meanwhile, said, “I am happy that the minister has raised the issue of my brother’s death in police custody. I am sure the accused will be held soon and action will be taken against the policemen.” When asked about the minister's claims, Lakhimpur Kheri SP Vijay Dhull said, “I am not aware if any such allegation was levelled. The investigation of this case is with SIT and I can’t comment on it.” A senior cop, who was deployed for the security arrangements on the day of the clashes, said, “We had barricaded the road from both sides and provided protesters a different route. But the convoy passed through the barricades at a very high speed. Policemen signalled them to slow down. A normal person doesn't drive so fast in a busy market. There were many farmers on the road. Barricades are normally set up for vehicles to slow down, but (in this case) the convoy didn’t pay heed." TOI tried to contact Ajay Mishra for his comments, but he didn’t respond to calls. Incidentally, soon after the violence, protesting farmers had claimed that Shyam Sundar was beaten up and handed over to police “alive”. They had also released photos to support the claim. A farmer, who was at the protest that day, had told TOI, “He was not critical. We have a photo in which he is walking with the police after we handed him over.” This came even as three co-accused in the matter were sent back to jail on Sunday. They are now under judicial custody following the three-day police remand. The accused, including Ashish, have been kept in separate barracks, jailer Pankaj Singh said. In another development, in a video message released by police on Sunday, Amandeep Singh Sandhu, Lakhimpur Kheri district president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait), said that Samyukta Kisan Morcha's 'Rail roko' protest scheduled on October 18 has been called off in Kheri district after a meeting of the senior members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-mos-says-bjp-man-dragged-away-killed-while-in-police-custody-cops-to-blame/articleshow/87090793.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Writing was cathartic, helped tackle painful memories: Mukerjea||Twenty-three year old Vidhie Mukerjea has seen more of the world in six years than most people do in their lifetime. She was 18, just back from school, when she found that her mother, Indrani Mukerjea, had been arrested for the murder of her stepsister Sheena Bora. If that were not bad enough, her stepfather, media mogul Peter Mukerjea, was also arrested on charges of conspiracy soon after. Though neither a suspect nor an accused, Mukerjea felt shamed by the media for many years. In her first book, the Devil’s Daughter, Mukerjea confronts the incidents and gives her side of the narrative. Speaking to author Harshali Singh at the Times LitFest, Mukerjea said, “When the case broke out I knew I wasn’t at fault. I was a by-product of the case, but through the years it all got so confusing and I have been under intense media scrutiny. It really made me wonder if the same thing would happen to me if I had been a boy.” Mukerjea said that the book’s title is a metaphor for society that included the media, the public and herself. After years of anxiety, panic attacks through her parents’ trial and ill-health, Mukerjea said that writing proved cathartic and helped her confront painful and unsettling memories. “This journey has taught me that no matter what you do people will try to bring you down. You have to be your own cheerleader. You do you,” she said. Her advice for other youngsters going through difficult situations? “Work on yourself and have confidence. For six years I looked for the light at the end of the tunnel till I finally found it. And for the many people who want to pull you down, there are others who are secretly rooting for you,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/writing-was-cathartic-helped-tackle-painful-memories-mukerjea/articleshow/87092952.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was the plucky teenager who managed to alert people to her plight, after tricking the traffickers into taking her to an ice cream shop. The minor had left her home in Ahmednagar after a spat with her family about two months ago. She travelled to various cities, doing odd jobs to earn a living. “The minor had arrived at Panvel from Kerala by train five days ago, and lost her wallet. Two unknown women lured her with a job offer,” said deputy SP Sonali Kadam. The girl was taken to a farmhouse in Saswane, where she was asked to engage in physical relations with customers. She resisted, then said she wished to have ice cream with the customers. On arriving at the shop on Wednesday, she asked some locals to help her. The villagers took her to the police station. Cops arrested the two women, the farmhouse owner, and the man who took her to Saswane. “A manhunt is on for the customer. The girl is at a children’s home, and her parents have been informed,” added Kadam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/ice-cream-trip-saves-minor-girl-from-sex-traffickers/articleshow/87095350.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Politicking resumes in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: The ruling TRS has started playing the “benefit and loss” card in its campaigning to corner BJP and woo voters in the Huzurabad assembly constituency going to the by-poll on October 30. Finance minister T Harish Rao, who is spearheading the campaign for the ruling party, is telling the voters that if Eatala Rajender wins it would only benefit BJP and that the people of Huzurabad would be at loss as Eatala, as an opposition MLA, cannot do much for the welfare and development of the constituency. “Has Eatala promised any major project or welfare scheme for Huzurabad constituency if he is voted to victory? People of Huzurabad should think whether they were benefited by TRS or BJP and they stand to benefit from which of the parties until the next assembly elections. You did not get the promised Rs 15 lakh in your bank accounts from the BJP government? Do not trust Eatala, he is lying to get votes,” Harish Rao said during his campaign on Sunday. “But if Gellu Srinivas Yadav of TRS wins, it will benefit the people of the constituency. TRS will be in the government for the next two years and would be able to not only continue all its existing welfare schemes but may also bring in new schemes and spend money for development of the constituency,” he added. Harish Rao also promised the people of Mamidalapalli village in Veenavanka mandal that he would ensure development in the village, if 90% of the votes were polled in favour of Srinivas Yadav.Also, a victory of TRS might force state BJP leaders to exert pressure on the Modi-government at the Centre to reduce prices of petrol, diesel and gas, and stop privatisation of public sector undertakings, which would snatch away the reservations of SCs, STs and BCs. Eatala too appealed to the people to take revenge against CM KCR and the ruling TRS. “KCR promised to make a Dalit as CM but did not do it. Now he has come with Dalit Bandhu with an eye on votes,” Rajender said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/politicking-resumes-in-huzurabad/articleshow/87092979.cms||Roushan Ali

Both were killed in an encounter that broke out during an anti-insurgency operation in the Poonch sector of Kashmir after they lost contact with their team during the operation. Meanwhile, last rites of the two other soldiers from the state, who were killed during the same operation earlier this week, were performed at their native villages.

Aliyar dam at Pollachi neared its full reservoir level of 120ft, as rain continued to lash its catchment areas in Western Ghats. Water level in the Sholayar dam at Valparai, where the highest rainfall was recorded in the district on Saturday, too touched its full reservoir level of 160ft. As the inflow to these dams kept rising, officials have increased the quantum of water being released from them. Officials said almost all the waterbodies in the district had been maintaining a high water level for the past few months, because of the copious rainfall this year. While the district in general recorded mild showers throughout the day, some parts such as Valparai received heavy rain. The Koolangal river at Valparai was brimming and so was the Noyyal river and other waterbodies downhill. Check dams at Chithiraichavadi, Puttuvikki and Sunnambukalvai were overflowing and the water flow to lakes kept increasing steadily. However, the public were restricted to visit the check dams as a precautionary measure. Other tourist places such as Kovai Kutralam also remained closed for the public. Officials said the water flow in the Noyyal had surged over the past two days, because of the heavy rainfall. However, environmentalists said many irrigation channels were yet to be desilted and as such the water flow was hindered. Meanwhile, the city corporation is taking efforts to pump out water stagnating on the underpasses in the city. An official said they had kept ready a disaster management team to tackle emergency situations, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rain-fills-dams-leaves-lakes-in-spate/articleshow/87093015.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The elephant safari is one of the prime attractions in Dudhwa. A ride atop an elephant is the best way to spot rhinos. The safari was suspended last year following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was feared that the tourists could pass on the virus to the animals. This time round, forest department officials expect tourist footfall to go up as compared to the previous years. “All the roads inside the reserve have been repaired and we are expecting a better tourist turnout this season as the previous one came to an abrupt end because of the Covid wave,” said Sanjay Pathak, field director, DTR. Dudhwa normally remains open from November to June. Last year, almost 38,000 tourists visited the reserve before suspension of the tour, generating a revenue of over Rs 75 lakh. Giving details about the safari, officials said two dedicated elephants will be deployed for taking tourists for a tour of the swampy terrain, where rhinos dwell. Each elephant will carry four tourists on its back along with the mahout. The price per tourist has been revised to Rs 500 this season. It is more convenient to sight rhinos from an elephant's back as compared to vehicles because the pachyderms can negotiate through the swampy land amid the tall grass, said Pathak. The duration of a safari would be over one hour till the group spots rhinos in the protected area. The timings of elephant safari are from early morning till 10 am. Thereafter, the elephants are given time to rest before the evening session, they said. Besides repairing roads in the reserve, a dedicated meditation hall has been prepared based on the feedback of the people who visited earlier, the officials said. “People of the Tharu community have expressed their wish to serve their cuisine to tourists this season as well,” added Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/elephant-safari-to-resume-in-dudhwa-officials-expect-tourist-footfall-to-go-up-this-season/articleshow/87090849.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Kudos to everyone present here for supporting such a great cause.” "We are very happy to organise this cyclothon on the occasion of World Sight Day, as we want everybody to see well. This can only happen when we achieve a fit body, fit mind, and fit sight.

---||Nagpur||At least 50% increase likely in charges for school buses, vans||Nagpur: The fuel price hike impact will now have a direct effect on the overall cost of education, as school vans and buses may increase charges by minimum 50% to stay afloat. The continuously rising fuel prices, combined with reduced seating capacity due to Covid restrictions and other overheads, have put transporters in a financially challenging spot. Santosh Jog, president of School and Staff Bus Owners Association, said “Definitely, the hike in transport fee has to be at least 50%, else we won’t be able to operate.” When school buses shut operations in Nagpur, due to second wave lockdown, diesel prices were hovering around Rs70. Now, the price has breached the Rs100-mark and is slowly heading upwards. And keeping prices fixed for the entire year, which has always been the practice, is akin to taking a risk. Jog said, “The transport fee hike which is implemented in October may be obsolete by January as fuel prices are likely to go up.” After reopening in the same calendar year, school buses have already witnessed the fuel prices going up by over 40% in just a few months. Hence their hesitation to fix the transport fee for the entire academic year. Another factor which will lead to fee hike is the seating capacity. Jog said, “We are operating at 50% seating capacity which means our revenue has been cut by half. So, income is down by 50%, fuel prices have increase by over 40% and the trained labour shortage is compounding problems for us.” For those parents who rely on school vans, the problem remains the same. Afsar Khan, president of School Vans Owners Association said, “Some of our vans runs on petrol, while others on diesel. Petrol is now over Rs110, so you can imagine the cost of transportation for us. There is no other option but to hike the transportation charges by around 50% as now we are allowed only five students per vehicle.” If all this was not enough, both vans and buses have another expense which they term as ‘restarting costs’. Jog said, “For 1.5 years now, 90% of our vehicles have been stationery. To bring them back on the road we are looking at Rs 1 lakh per bus. This cost includes full servicing, part replacement if needed, payment of insurance premium, taxes and RTO charges.” Associations hesitant to implement hike immediately While the two associations — School and Staff Bus Owners Association and School Vans Owners Association — say steep fee hike is inevitable, there seems to be a hesitancy to implement it immediately. A school van owner said, “What are the chances of parents agreeing to a 50% hike in transport fee? Since online classes are anyway going on, they will prefer to stay home. Fee will have to be hiked in a phased manner which will mean initial loss but with the hope that every month things will get better.” Associations feel that after Diwali, the restrictions might be eased. Khan said, “We might be allowed to operate at full capacity thus increasing our revenue. So transport fee hike will happen, it’s just a question of whether it happens before or after Diwali.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-least-50-increase-likely-in-charges-for-school-buses-vans/articleshow/87091468.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Around 1100 idols from community pujas were immersed in these ponds across areas like Behala, Tollygunge and Jadavpur. Besides, a few waterbodies located off EM Bypass were also used for immersions.  These ‘ghats’ were decked up and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation arranged for the necessary infrastructural support for the puja organizers (both community and family pujas) that included supply of porters and cleaning these ghats. Kolkata police and trained personnel from state’s disaster management group lent support to the KMC in ensuring a hassle-free immersion at these ghats. The civic authorities and Kolkata police persuaded organizers of a large number of community pujas this year to choose local ponds for immersions instead of taking the idols to Babughat amid Covid restrictions. Some of the major ponds where over 150 idols were immersed till Sunday include Patuli pond, Panchasayar pond, Mukundapur pond, Ranikuthi pond, Layelka pond, Sarsuna jheel, Panrnasree jheel among others. At the Sarsuna College Jheel, 21 personnel were on duty with a DMG team in tow. At Mukundapur pond, there were 17 personnel and a DMG team stationed from 3 pm till well past midnight to carry out the immersions. Cops said that adequate CCTV cameras were installed at major ponds in Kolkata where immersions were carried out. Around 1,000 police personnel manned the roads leading up to the water bodies in the added areas of Kolkata to ensure smooth immersion. "Considering the Covid situation, all the organisers have been asked to come to the ponds directly from the pandals. The directives will be the same as ghats and there will be no leeway provided to local organizers. There will be no procession or display of idols during or before the immersion. The organisers have been asked to adhere to the Covid restrictions. Only three persons will be allowed to enter the pond," a senior police officer said. Violations though have been already reported from city suburbs as both banned firecrackers and DJ system - along with elaborate processions were noticed in these parts on Friday night. Over 400 idols from all over New Town, Rajarhat and Salt Lake were immersed at the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) run immersion ghat located in action area I in New Town. Puja organizers could avail four immersion bays simultaneously for their idols. This apart, a special arena was also created for performing dhunuchi dance under strict police vigil. “Like previous years, the immersion process was systematically organised at the Bisarjan ghat arranged by NKDA, police and health department, following all Covid safety protocols. Four immersion bays were demarcated and only the NKDA workers were entrusted to carry out the idol immersions at the waterbody,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Over 100 police personnel were deployed to keep a watch on the immersion in accordance with Covid protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ponds-used-for-immersions-in-kol-and-new-town/articleshow/87090986.cms||Saikat Ray

According to a police officer, a special team led by sub-inspector Jecis Udhayaraj had got a tip about the ganja peddlers and they had deployed a decoy to strike a deal with them for 10kg ganja. “The decoy had asked them to bring ganja to Podanur on Saturday night. When two of the ganja peddlers - 62-year-old P Anthony, of Mulavukad in Ernakulam district in Kerala, and 51-year-old N Mayan, of Usilampatti in Madurai - turned up to seal the deal, the team caught them and seized 10kg ganja and a bike from them.” Preliminary inquiry revealed that Anthony had taken a rental house at Othakkalmandapam on the outskirts of the city to stock ganja. “He used to visit Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh to procure ganja, which was then smuggled to Othakkalmandapam. The team conducted a raid at the house and seized another 14kg ganja from there,” the officer said. During questioning, the officer said, the two told the team that one more person - 49-year-old B Muruganandam, from Kadamalaikundu village in Theni district - was involved in the gang. The team subsequently arrested him from Pollachi bus stand the same night. “While Anthony used to smuggle the contraband from Andhra Pradesh, the remaining two were supplying it in the district.” All the three were booked under sections 8 (c), 20 (b) (ii) (C) and 29 (l) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and produced before a judicial magistrate on Sunday morning. Later, they were lodged in Sathyamangalam sub-jail under judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/3-men-held-for-smuggling-supplying-ganja-in-district/articleshow/87093096.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Women volunteers aim to prepare around one lakh diyas and 50,000 flower pots of three different sizes ahead of Diwali with the help of machines. District Manager (National Rural Livelihood Mission)Amit Shukla told TOI, "Over 30 women associated with three self-help groups are shaping designer diyas and flower pots with the help of cow dung." He added that this time, we have brought a special machine to shape diyas and flower pots in Kanha gaushala in Shankargarh block.  He further added, "Cow dung of over 2,500 cows sheltering at Kanha gaushala would be utilized by these volunteers and they would earn good profits. Demand for traditional diyas and gamla made of cow dung has been pouring in from different parts of the state. Moreover, women associated with other self-help groups are shaping traditional and designer diyas and idols of Lord Ganesh and Goddess Laxmi and candles at Bahadurpur and Bahariya blocks.

This includes a suspected loss of life owing to drowning and several property damages. A guest labourer from Jharkhand went missing in the Amayizhanchan canal at Kakkode near Kannammoola around 2 pm while bathing in the canal. The police said the water level was higher than usual and the current was very strong when the mishap occurred. Nahardeep Kumar Mondal, 30, is the one who went missing. He resided near the canal and was swimming in it along with his brother and two other friends when he drowned. Though the scuba diving experts of the fire department conducted a search till dusk, he could not be found. The search will resume on Sunday morning. Several houses suffered partial damages during the rains at Neyyattinkara, Varkala and Nedumangad taluks. Later the residents of these houses were shifted to other places. As many as four families at Mathipuzha near Vithura were also shifted to safer places after water rose to an alarming level in the nearby river. Two children sustained minor injuries when portions of a wall of their house collapsed at Chempakamangalam under Mangalapuram police station limits. The wall of a house at Thengappura Lane under Vanchiyoor police station limits also collapsed. In the city, flash floods were experienced at Ambalathara and Muttathara regions. Over 100 houses at Adimalathura near Vizhinjam were also inundated by flood water. Incidents of tree falling were reported around 25 locations across the district. Fortunately no casualties were reported in these incidents. Three wells, one in Anavoor village and two in Balaramapuram village, were caved in during the rain. The shutters of Neyyar, Aruvikkara and Peppara reservoirs were raised as the water level continued to rise. The district collector has warned the people residing on the banks of Karamana and Neyyar rivers to take caution. Tourism activities at Neyyar dam as well as traffic to Ponmudi hill station have been closed considering the hazardous situation. The collector has also ordered a halt to all quarrying and mining activities in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/heavy-downpour-lashes-city-one-missing-several-houses-damaged/articleshow/87070105.cms||---

After an hour-long meeting, more than 30 residents put up boards and banners saying, “for sale”, outside their homes as a mark of protest. The residents alleged that despite repeated complaints, police had turned a blind eye to the illegal gambling and sale of alcohol in the area and had not arrested anyone. “The police know everything, but no action is being taken. So, we are being forced to sell our houses and migrate,” alleged Javed Ali, a resident. Jitendra Singh, SHO of Nauchandi police station, told TOI that the police are investigating the matter and statements of the residents are being recorded. “Prima facie nothing wrong was found in the house of the person against whom the locals have raised the objections. We did not find any drug or other substance from the house. Still the matter is being investigated,” the SHO added. But residents of Dhabai, a Muslim dominated area, alleged that the woman had been carrying on with her illegal activities ever since she came to live there a decade ago. Mohammed Sarun, who participated in the protest, told TOI that residents of the entire locality were fed up with the woman. “She is selling alcohol and drugs from her house. She is also into prostitution,” he alleged and added, “Our children are exposed to the wrong influence. We will not live in this area till she vacates the house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/residents-stage-protest-against-alcohol-gambling-biz-in-area-threaten-to-move-out/articleshow/87090968.cms||Ishita Mishra

The goats belong to K Rangasamy, 65, of K N Palayam. Three more goats were injured in the attack. A farmer, Rangasamy was rearing the goats in a closed pen near his house. Sathyamangalam range officer S Bernard said the leopard entered the pen and attacked the goats around 5am. Hearing their bleating, Rangasamy came out of his house and found the leopard attacking them. Though he alerted forest officials, the leopard killed seven goats and fled by the time they reached the spot. “We have traced the leopard’s pugmarks and registered a case,” Bernard added. In another incident, an unknown vehicle fatally knocked down a male leopard, believed to be less than two years old, while it was crossing the road near Sikkalli, a hamlet in STR, on Sunday morning.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3rd genome study shows Delta still most dominant variant, but vax effective too||MUMBAI: Delta continues to be the most dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation in Mumbai, according to the third Covid-19 genetic sequencing results released by the BMC on Sunday. And, in keeping with the trend seen in the rest of the world, the survey showed that the proportion of Delta derivatives in the city’s samples has increased. Of the 343 Covid-positive samples tested during the third sequencing, 54% had the Delta variant, 34% were Delta derivatives and 12% were other variants. In the second survey done in September, 80% of the samples were the Delta strain. Delta derivatives are sub-lineages of the Delta variant and considered the most dangerous mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus so far as it increased transmissibility and increased ability to cause a severe form of Covid-19. Delta caused the second wave in India. BMC officials, however, believe the Delta derivatives may not be as dangerous as the main Delta variant. On Sunday, BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC doctors had matched the genetic results with clinical reports of the patients and found that the Delta derivatives were less transmissible. “Compared to the Delta variant, the transmission speed of the derivative is lower,” said the BMC note. Previous reports suggest that Delta derivative A.Y4 is the fastest growing variant, it accounted for only 2% of the samples from Maharashtra in July but increased 44% in August. Incidentally, the third sequencing done at BMC-run Kasturba Hospital also contains an analysis of breakthrough infections (when a person gets the infection despite being vaccinated against it). Of the 343 Covid-patients whose samples were taken for genetic sequencing, 54 had taken one dose but only seven needed hospitalisation. None needed ICU or oxygen support. While 168 patients had taken both the shots, 46 of them needed hospitalisation and none died. In contrast, of the 121 patients who were not vaccinated, 57 needed hospitalisation and three died. “One needed oxygen, while the others needed ICU,” said the BMC note. Of the three dead patients, one had Delta infection while the other two had Delta derivatives. “The overall message is that whatever the variant, those who were vaccinated had mild infection. Many were asymptomatic,” said Dr Jayanti Shastri, who heads the BMC’s genetic sequencing laboratory that was inaugurated on August 4. Kakani said these findings suggest that the outbreak is under control due to vaccination. “Therefore, all eligible citizens should be vaccinated against Covid and strictly follow the Covid-appropriate behavior.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3rd-genome-study-shows-delta-still-most-dominant-variant-but-vax-effective-too/articleshow/87095379.cms||---

The government sanctioned Rs 4 lakh as immediate assistance to the families of those who died in the landslides and floods. Vijayan said all precautions are being taken to shift the people from the sensitive regions and sought the support of the people for this. The people should not hesitate in shifting from their homes to safer locations, he said. “People should avoid all travels between districts and should go out only in emergency situations. The prediction is that the state would receive more rain and hence people should be more cautious,” said Vijayan. National disaster response teams have been deployed in all sensitive areas of Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Alappauzha, Idukki, Ernakulam and Malappuram. Army personnel were involved in relief operations launched in aid to civil administration in flood-ravaged Kottayam. Around 40 Army personnel and flood relief equipment were deployed in Kavali, Koottickal in Kottayam. One column of Army personnel from DSC Centre, Kannur, with engineering and medical components arrived at Wayanad and commenced rescue operations. Another specialist engineering task force (ETF) under Headquarters Dakshin Bharat Area from Bengaluru arrived at Mundakayam and Koottickal. A total of three columns have been deployed by the Army. Prime minister Narendra Modi called the chief minister and pledged all support from the Centre for the relief and rehabilitation process. The Prime Minister expressed concern over the loss of lives due to the landslide. Meanwhile, revenue minister K Rajan said there are reports that the rains will intensify in the state from Wednesday, and steps have been taken to open more relief camps in the worst-hit districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rs-4l-to-kin-of-dead-cm-urges-caution-as-rains-continue/articleshow/87093145.cms||---
---||Meerut||Want to get daughter married, Uttar Pradesh man had said hours before terrorists killed him||MEERUT: “I am looking for a suitable boy for my Shobi,” Sagir Ahmed had told his daughter Nazrana about his youngest child over phone from Litter In Pulwama. The call was made at about 6.30 pm on Saturday. He was happy. "People here," he had said earlier, "are nice. I should be fine. You all worry too much." Nazrana got another call after two hours. She wondered if her father had missed out on something he wanted to say. But this time it was Sajjad Ahmed Wani, Sagir's employer, on the other end of a shaky line. "I have bad news for you," he said. Nazrana froze. Sagir Ahmed, a carpenter from UP's Saharanpur who had lost his job back home during the pandemic and travelled all the way to Pulwama to make a living for the sake of his family, had been gunned down by terrorists hunting down non-Kashmiris. He was the 11th innocent civilian to fall in two weeks to mindless slaughter in the Valley. Twenty-year-old Shobi's wedding would have to wait. "All Sagir wanted was to see Shobi married," Wani told TOI. "He doted on her, his little one. Sagir was a quiet, spiritual person, somewhat shy. Why would something like this happen to him?" Sagir worked at Wani's furniture manufacturing unit, the oldest of all his employees. Wani was the first one to see Sagir's bullet-riddled body sprawled on the floor of the small rented house in Litter. Wani took Sagir to a hospital where he died during treatment. “No one would have learnt about his death if I hadn't reached his place to check on him. I meet all my workers everyday before calling it a day. When I reached Sagir’s place, he was drenched in blood.” The job in Litter allowed Sagir to send home about Rs 15,000 home per month. The father of five, four daughters and a son, hadn't allowed the death of his wife due to Covid six months ago to come in the way of his regular remittances from Kashmir. Sagir’s brother Naieem told TOI: "He came back for a short while in 2020, but returned to Kashmir again. He always told us he was safe there in Kashmir, that people were friendly and things would get better. When Nafeesa died, it was the biggest jolt Sagir had faced in life. He loved her more than anything else. But he didn't let the sadness affect the regularity with which he sent money to his family. He was at it. There was also a loan of Rs 1 lakh to pay off too. It weighed on his head." After getting information that a resident of Saharanpur was killed in a terrorist attack in Kashmir, officials from the local administration visited Sagir's house on Saturday night. Additional district magistrate Archana Dwivedi said, “The financial condition of the family is not good. We have assured his family that every possible help will be provided to them. A report on the compensation to be given to the family is being prepared and will be sent to the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/want-to-get-daughter-married-up-man-had-said-hours-before-terrorists-killed-him/articleshow/87091009.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Kochi||Kerala: Incessant rains continue to wreak havoc in Thrissur||THRISSUR: Incessant rain continued to batter Thrissur on Sunday and 105 relief camps were set up in the district to help people move to safer areas. While a red alert was issued for Peringalkuthu, Peechi and Sholayar dams, an orange alert was issued for Vazhani and Chimony dams. There were no reports of human casualties. By evening, 14 camps became operational and official sources said 309 people from 91 families were shifted here. They said a large number of people were heading to relief camps as water levels in all rivers in the district were rising. Minor landslides were reported from Puthur and Puthukkad. Water level in Peringalkuthu reached 420.3m at 7pm. After water was released, the water level in Chalakudy River increased. Officials said that as per the readings at the gauging station in Vettilappara, water level had crossed the warning level. Though water level has not risen dangerously at Chalakudy by late evening, there were apprehensions of a further increase. KSEB’s assistant executive engineer in charge of Peringalkuthu, Suresh said that 2400 cusecs of water is being released from Parambikulam now and water level in Chalakudy was 3.7m; the alert level is 7.1m. Chalakudy river protection forum asked authorities to take proactive measures to avert frequent floods in Chalakudy River. One important step they said was to maintain low water level at Peringalkuthu dam whenever there is a high rain alert. Similarly, steps must be taken to ensure effective coordination with Tamil Nadu officials to avert abrupt, excessive water release from Parambikulam dam. Water level in Peechi dam crossed the proposed rule curve level and its four spillway shutters were opened up to 20 cm. This led to a rise in water levels in Manali River and people staying on the banks of the river were told to be alert. Authorities took steps to shift people staying in the low-lying areas at Thrikkoor and Pallam after this. A red alert was issued for Sholayar dam after water level in the reservoir reached 2663.3ft. Officials said water level in Kurumali River reached its warning level around 7pm and alerts were issued to people staying in the downstream areas at Cherpu, Chazhoor, Thanniam, Karalam, Kattoor, Porathissery and Edathiruthy. Collector Haritha V Kumar asked people to be ready to shift to safer places the moment the first warning is issued for flood or landslide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/incessant-rains-continue-to-wreak-havoc-in-thrissur/articleshow/87093197.cms||T Ramavarman

Singh will be produced before the court by the economic offences wing (EOW) on Monday. Varanasi police commissioner A Satish Ganesh on Sunday said, “The accused Rajiv Singh was arrested from a luxurious hotel in Bajaj Nagar police station area of Jaipur on Saturday by our team comprising sub-inspector Prabhakar Singh from Lanka police station, Shailesh Yadav from Bhelupur, constables Sumit Singh from police lines, Rohit Pandey from Chitaipur police station and Anugrah Verma of surveillance cell in crime branch. The team completed all the basic legal formalities in Jaipur and has brought Singh to the city. He will be produced in the court here by EOW on Monday.” Singh was hiding in a four-star hotel of Jaipur on a fake identity for many days, the CP said. “This was the fourth time in the last 15 days when an accused has been arrested from another state by Varanasi Police in the Shine City scam. Before Singh, three accused were arrested from Bihar and West Bengal in separate swift inter-state operations of police,” he added. Singh, a resident of Kaimur, Bihar, is alleged to be one of the kingpins of the Rs 287 crore Shine City scam, and had been booked in multiple cases in Varanasi for cheating hundreds of citizens by luring them to invest their money to buy land. “A local court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Singh. After producing him in the court on Monday, police will seek his remand for questioning and further investigation,” the police commissioner said. The CP also announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 for the team for this achievement. Total 284 cases are lodged against real estate firm ‘Shine City Group of Companies’ for cheating investors of over Rs 237 crore. Before Singh, Varanasi cops had arrested Aryan Bhargava from Bandel in West Bengal on October 13 and one of the masterminds Mushtaq Alam of Deoria from Bihar. Police had announced a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh each on the prime accused Rashid Naseem and Asif Naseem who are suspected to be hiding in the Gulf. Five other masterminds of the company, on whom cash reward of Rs one lakh each has been announced, are also on the radar of police while number of arrests has gone above 50 so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-cops-nab-another-accused-in-rs-287cr-shine-city-scam/articleshow/87089333.cms||---

KMDA chief executive officer (CEO) Antara Acharya said they have already started working on preparing temporary ghats for the devotees to perform their rituals and a meeting with all stakeholders is scheduled next week to discuss the issue and make people aware of the alternative arrangements. “All last year’s protocols will be strictly followed. The local community will be informed of the places where the alternative arrangements are being set up. A meeting on this is slated next week,” Acharya told TOI on Sunday. The authorities, in consultation with the police, will be making all necessary security arrangements at the two lakes like last year. Both Sarobar gates will be shut, there will be police patrolling and notice boards will be put up to inform the visitors. Last year, the authorities had set up 44 temporary alternative ghats at several water bodies off EM Bypass and some large ponds within the city. The matter of allowing Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar went to the court last year as the state government filed a review petition at the Supreme Court with the appeal to allow Puja to be observed at Rabindra Sarobar. However, the court refused to grant a stay on the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order. It was back in 2018 that NGT banned Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar, to keep the lake water pollution free. In 2019, KMDA had tried to comply with the NGT order but had failed to prevent devotees from entering the Sarobar premises. In its appeal to NGT, KMDA had cited this issue, mentioning that many women, children and elderly people come to Rabindra Sarobar to observe the Chhath Puja rituals and that it was difficult to forcibly stop them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chhath-puja-ban-at-lakes-to-continue/articleshow/87091027.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The department has identified a location at Manthirimattam to set up an enclosure, where the eight-month-old male tiger cub would be kept for two years as part of the rewilding exercise. It would be, however, released into the wild only based on the hunting ability it acquires. A forest officer said the tiger cub was rescued after it was found wandering outside the reserve forest in a weak condition. “The cub had a porcupine quill on its body.” Principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj, ATR field director S Ramasubramanian and senior forest department officials visited the tiger cub, which is kept in a cage near the forest department’s rest house at Manambolly, on Sunday. Niraj said, “For the first time, we are going to rewild a tiger cub in Tamil Nadu. We have identified a 10,000sqft area in Manthirimattam reserve forest to set up the enclosure, which will be ready soon with CCTV camera surveillance system. Trenches will be set up around the enclosure to keep other wild animals at bay. Only one or two caretakers will be allowed in the locality and we will closely monitor the animal’s hunting methods.” Ramasubramanian said human presence would be controlled in the locality and the caretakers won’t be allowed to become friendly with the cub. He said the plan was to set up a chain-link fencing that would be 15ft high around the 10,000sqft area. “The height of the fencing will reduce the chances of the cub escaping from the enclosure. To prevent snakes from entering the enclosure, wire mesh will be installed at a 3ft height from the ground level. We won’t disturb the forest cover and a water trough will be created in the area. If the tiger cub needs more space, we will set up another enclosure in the adjacent area and create a passage to it from the existing one,” Ramasubramanian said. He said they were planning to send a proposal for Rs 60 lakh to the National Tiger Conservation Authority for the rewilding programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-dept-to-rewild-tiger-cub/articleshow/87093230.cms||A Subburaj

In Kolkata and suburbs 3262 Kali pujas are held. In November last year, the Calcutta high court had issued a complete ban on the “use or display or bursting” of firecrackers across Bengal till the end of this month, “for the greater good of the citizens and in the larger public interest”. The ban included “all types of sparklers and the like” and everything which generates “sound or light”. Only “wax- or oil-based diyas” would be allowed, the HC had made it clear. CM Mamata Banerjee has also urged people to show restraint during Diwali. In her Bijoya greetings letter, the CM urged all that while enjoying the festivities everyone should be careful and sensitive. The police organisers meeting come ahead of the formal government guidelines for the Kali Puja and Diwali celebrations. Janbazar Sammilito Kali Puja Samiti president Sandipan Saha said, “We will abide by the guidelines issued. Most organisers have planned their pandals keeping in mind the restrictions which were in force last year. All Covid guidelines will be followed.” Lalbazar sources said that - just like Durga Puja - they are hoping that the government will issue an SOP that stresses on restrictions on fairs and cultural programmes that are held in certain pockets of the city during the festival. Unlike Durga Puja, police believe it will be much easier to regulate Kali Puja as few of them are as elaborate. Pandals are usually located on the main road with the idols easily visible. Also, traditionally, the pandals are open on three sides. Also, the Puja is usually restricted to a day except on S N Banerjee Road and Amherst Street where the celebrations are held over three days. Lalbazar said that besides the nine police divisions, the detective department has also formed crack teams to seize illegal fireworks. Police will also enforce the Supreme Court order on firecrackers. A detailed communication on firecrackers is awaited, said sources. EOM Last year Calcutta high court Kali Puja and Diwali guidelines Calcutta High Court had issued a complete ban on the “use or display or bursting” of firecrackers across Bengal till the end of this month, “for the greater good of the citizens and in the larger public interest”. The ban included “all types of sparklers and the like” and everything which generates “sound or light”. Only “wax- or oil-based diyas” would be allowed, the HC made it clear. The duration of the ban covers not only the twin festivals of Kali Puja and Diwali, but also Chhath Puja, Jagadhhatri Puja and Guru Nanak’s birthday celebrations. The HC had directed the police to maintain strict vigil to ensure there was “no sale or purchase of firecrackers of any form” in the state for the duration of the ban. The HC said that for Kali Puja, Jagaddhatri Puja and Kartick Puja pandals, the “no-entry zone” order issued for Durga Puja would apply. But since Kali Puja pandals are smaller and there are fewer of them, the HC modified its order and said the no-entry zones would extend to a five-metre area on all sides that are open. Only dhakis would be allowed in this five-metre zone. The HC also said sanitisers and masks would be mandatory, immersions should be low-key and processions would not be permitted. The use of bands and lights at the time of immersion would also be prohibited. The court allowed the local police to provide staggered timings at immersion ghats to prevent overcrowding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-kali-puja/articleshow/87091041.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Meanwhile, the BMC public health department has asked every ward to carry out intensive mobile drives near housing colonies and public places to boost vaccination numbers. “This is the last-mile challenge and most people who wanted to take the vaccine have already done so. The few who couldn’t due to distance or their hectic schedule can now take it in their neighbourhood,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/100-first-jab-coverage-of-citys-adult-popn-likely-by-month-endin-mumbai/articleshow/87095382.cms||---

The water level in the Kallada river is rising and the inflow into the Thenmala dam was shot up in the continuing rain. Dam's shutters were lifted by 80 cm in view of the rising water level. The flood water from the Ithikkara river washed away a road at Perinnalloor on the Anchal–Ayoor road. The MC road was submerged in the rain water at Valakom. At Idappalayam in the Aryankavu village, a huge tree standing precariously on the way side of the Kollam-Thirumangalam National Highway was felled. As the land here caved in National Highway, assistant engineer has been asked to secure the road. Meanwhile, the meteorology department has alerted the fishermen of the high risk in venturing out to sea and has advised to avoid fishing in the coming days too. Strong winds and rain and lightning are predicted on the Kerala-Lakshadweep coast. People have been advised to maintain vigil in the coming days also. District collector Afasna Parveen said the district administration was ready to deal with any eventuality in the district. Collector who is also the chairperson of the district disaster management authority said the facilities to provide special assistance were arranged in the already submerged areas and places which are likely to be flooded. Relief camps will be opened to shelter the people affected by the rain. She said in view of the increase in inflow at the Parappar dam, shutters will be lifted 40 cm in addition to the 80 cm. People living in the areas around are advised to shift to safer places. DMO has been asked to provide sufficient medicine in the relief camps. Antigen tests also will be held at the camps.

---||Pune||Traffic snarls choke lanes parallel to busy Karve Road||Pune: Increased movement of vehicles along Kashibai Khilare Road, between Sanjeevan Hospital and Padale Palace Chowk near Nal Stop, is leading to frequent traffic snarls and causing congestion in the surrounding area. Due to Metro work along Karve Road, only one lane is open for vehicles. As a result, many motorists, coming from Deccan Gymkhana area towards Nal Stop, prefer turning left from Garware College and then right to proceed along the Kashibai Khilare Road towards Padale Palace Chowk. Kashibai Khilare Road already has a narrow carriageway and is unable to sustain the increase in vehicular movement. According to the police, however, Karve Road is not facing any significant traffic congestion, as motorists seem to believe. “A week-long observation by the police revealed that there is no traffic jam on Karve road and at the Nal Stop Chowk. We are asking people to drive straight towards Nal Stop from Deccan Gymkhana instead of taking Kashibai Khilare Road,” said traffic police inspector Jayram Paygude. According to Paygude, the increased movement on Khilare Road is causing frequent traffic jams at Padale Palace Chowk and also Mhatre Bridge area. “Traffic is chaotic at Padale Palace Chowk as motorists heading towards Kothrud want to turn right turn towards Nal Stop while those going towards Deccan Gymkhana from Erandwane wants to turn right towards Sanjeevan Hospital,” he said. Paygude said the intersection witnesses heavy traffic, especially in the evening. “We have started deploying four to five personnel to clear the intersection in the evening,” he said. Local resident Shankar Ranpise said the parallel stretches and surrounding area were largely traffic-free until a few months ago. “The situation changed in the last one month and there is traffic chaos during the weekdays. Police must take steps to avert traffic jams in the area,” said Ranpise. Last week, Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said commuters on Karve Road would be able to use the new flyover at Nal Stop by January if everything goes as planned. Work on the flyover had begun in early 2019 as part of the fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi Metro corridor.  This will be a two-tier structure, with the Metro train running on the top level (the viaduct) and vehicles on the second deck. The flyover will support uninterrupted bidirectional movement of traffic on Karve Road as the flyover will take the Nal Stop signal out of the equation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traffic-snarls-choke-lanes-parallel-to-busy-karve-road/articleshow/87091074.cms||---

Speaking to reporters after inspecting Trichy central prison, he said the government will complete the process in about 15-20 days. “There are certain deciding parameters for premature release. Life convicts who completed 10 years of imprisonment are being surveyed across jails. The nature of charges against them will be scrutinised to consider for premature release,” Regupathy said. The government had announced last month that around 700 life convicts across the state will be released. On the release of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Regupathy said chief minister M K Stalin is determined to secure their release and the government will do the needful. During the pandemic, as inmates lack opportunities to meet their family members, the prisoners interacted with their families with the help of video conferencing and telephones, he said adding that mobile network jammers will be installed to prevent misuse of mobile phones in prisons. “There are 1,517 inmates in Trichy central prison. Industrial skill development training is provided only in two prisons across India, one at Trichy and the other at Jaipur central prison. Interested prisoners were also given support to pursue higher education,” Regupathy added. Blankets, bandages for Trichy MGMGH, personal hygiene products, files and baked food products prepared by the inmates were inspected by the minister jointly with school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/min-life-convicts-for-premature-release-will-be-known-in-20-days/articleshow/87093232.cms||---

In one of the videos posted, Sebastian is seen playing ‘tabla’ with a caption saying he is celebrating his suspension for saving the lives of the passengers. He is the driver of the KSRTC Erattupetta depot. The photograph of the KSRTC bus stuck in the flood waters and passengers, including women, being rescued from the bus had gone viral on social media. The bus was heading to Erattupetta when it got stuck and broke down in the flood waters in front of St Mary’s Church in Poonjar. The bus was later towed away. Sebastian was suspended for bringing damage to the vehicle and risking the lives of the passengers. Sebastian posted a video on his FB page explaining his version. He said that he had proceeded to take the vehicle through the water only after seeking the permission of the conductor and the passengers. He claimed that he decided to drive ahead as he was given support by the passengers. As the vehicle reached near the church, there was a sudden flow of water, which entered the engine of the bus causing the vehicle engine to stop, he said. He claimed that he told the passengers not to worry and then drove the vehicle and parked near the compound wall of the church making it easy for the passengers to escape. “I was only trying to rescue the passengers with courage and I did not do anything on my own,” he added. He also said that the reward he got for saving the passengers was suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ksrtc-driver-mocks-suspension/articleshow/87093241.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Mother, 70, who killed girl’s ‘rapist’ gets life||MEERUT: A 70-year-old widow was awarded life imprisonment 11 years after “killing” the man who allegedly tried to rape her daughter. The judgment passed by Bulandshahr’s additional sessions court’s judge Rajeshwar Shukla, which was delivered on October 14, a day before Dussehra, said that the woman “didn’t have to hit the deceased multiple times with an axe to stop the rape bid as even small force could have been deployed”. It concluded that the act was “honour killing” and a “planned murder.” The order, which was made available on Saturday, stated that the accused, Kasturi Devi, was found guilty of killing Praveen Kumar, who was 20 years old at the time of the incident that took place on July 31, 2010. Elaborating on the sequence of events, the court order, a copy of which is with TOI, mentioned that the woman, who was 59 at that time, had approached Anoopshahr police station in Bulandshahr and confessed to the murder. “As per the information given to court by police, Kasturi went to the cops and told them that she had killed Praveen who reached her house at midnight and grabbed her daughter “P” (the court had given her this name), who was also 20 then. “On seeing her daughter being sexually assaulted, Kasturi picked an axe lying in the corner of the terrace and hit the deceased causing his death,” the court order said. In the trial that took 11 years to complete — in the intervening period, the woman’s daughter got married and had children — the court received the post-mortem report of the deceased in which he was found to have ‘five grievous wounds’, all above his neck, including one below his eyes and on the chin. “Praveen was hit five times near his neck, which caused his immediate death. (If) Kasturi had to stop the rape bid, she didn’t have to hit the deceased so many times as even (a) small force ...could have averted the incident. As the family took the body outside the house and shouted for help after Praveen died, it looks like a planned conspiracy,” the court stated. The woman’s son and her daughter, who were eyewitnesses in the matter, had maintained it was a rape bid and that their mother killed the deceased in anger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-70-trying-to-stop-daughters-rape-gets-life-in-prison-11-yrs-after-killing-man/articleshow/87091052.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Nagpur||KSGA plans to start engine bay in Mihan by March 2023||Nagpur: Kalpana Saroj Global Aviation (KSGA), a subsidiary of Kamanani Tubes Limited, plans to come up with the country’s first engine bay by March 2023 in the Mihan SEZ. Headed by Padma Shri awardee Kalpana Saroj, known for her rags to riches story from life in the slums of Mumbai to being a corporate boss, the company has been allotted one acre of land. A ground breaking ceremony of the project was held on Sunday. State’s energy minister Nitin Raut, who is also the guardian minister of Nagpur district, was the chief guest. A consultant of the company while making a presentation said Lufthansa at Frankfurt in Germany has such a facility. The company’s chief administration officer Ashish Deshpande said aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul (MROs) will be carried out in Mihan. KGSGA will be the only facility dealing exclusively in engine repair and maintenance which is carried out separately. The company claims to generate net foreign exchange earnings (NFE) in the first year itself coming up as a cost-effective alternative to facilities abroad. “Since even the engines of aircraft flying domestically are leased to foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), even catering to carriers at home will generate foreign exchange,” said Deshpande The facility will be having 10 hangars and KGSA aims to start with taking in 40 to 60 engines for repair and maintenance work for the first two years. After that the numbers are expected to be doubled. The company will be taking up work for all the makes of aircraft engines, including the Roll-Royce and Pratt-Whitney, apart from other companies, said the consultant during the presentation. Apart from aeroplanes even helicopter engines will be maintained here. KGSGA expects major clientele from low cost airlines that find getting repairs or maintenance done at the plants of the OEMs costly. Even the OEMs would prefer having a facility taking up work for their engines in India. KGSA is looking forward to joint ventures and B2B tie-ups for the project. The future plans include staring an air charter service and an aviation training school. “We would be needing an investment of around Rs 20 crore for the initial set up which includes hangar and other civil work,” Kaplana Saroj, the CMD told ToI. This is the initial estimate with the funds coming from Kamani Tubes, the parent company. Saroj had entered the management of Kamani Tubes, a sick company in 2006, and revived it. “The estimate for the advanced stage will be made by my team of experts,” said Saroj. “I had sent a proposal to the PMO that we may need 30 acres of land. A letter of recommendation was soon sent to the state government. However, we planned to take one acre first which is the initial requirement. Further land would be acquired as the project is expanded,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ksga-plans-to-start-engine-bay-in-mihan-by-march-2023/articleshow/87091118.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Kolkata||Kolkata malls see record Puja crowd, sales||KOLKATA: After surpassing 2019 sales in the run-up to Durga Puja, malls in the city turned into hangout zones for youngsters and clocked record food and beverage (F&B) sales during the festive days. At South City, one of the most popular malls in the city and the largest in eastern India, footfall and revenue during Durga Puja have not only exceeded the numbers clocked in 2019, but have been the highest ever. “Malls have a decent turnout during Puja, but not exceptionally high since people are out pandal hopping. But since there were restrictions on entry to the pandals and people had nowhere to go, they ventured into malls they are familiar with and consider safe since protocols are being maintained,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. The aggregate footfall between Panchami and Dashami was 4.5 lakh, of which 1 lakh visitors were recorded on Panchami itself. Revenue from F&B sales was around 15%-20% more than that of 2019 and nearly 100% more than that of 2020. F&B revenue at the two City Centre malls in Salt Lake and New Town also showed 100% growth. Till Dashami, the footfall at City Centre-I was 4.2 lakh and that at City Centre-II was 3.2 lakh. “All malls have seen satisfactory growth in sales and footfall without any support from multiplexes. Usually, we get 20% of our total footfall due to multiplexes. But, for the first time, with no releases from Bollywood worth mentioning, footfall translated to sales, which will now set a different trend in retail business as dynamics have changed,” said Ramesh Pandey, wholetime director of Ambuja Neotia Group that owns and operates the two malls. Forum, the city’s first mall which is now positioned as a boutique facility on Elgin Road, does not have a food court. But its restaurants did phenomenal business through the Puja. The footfall at Mani Square was around 2.8 lakh on the six Puja days beginning Panchami with the food court, restaurants and cafes recording high business. Footfall and sales at Acropolis during the festive days, too, surpassed the pre-pandemic figures, clocking over 2 lakh visitors. “Our footfall grew by 80% and revenue grew by 25% over Puja 2019. The F&B outlets are absolutely ecstatic over how the Puja has panned out for them. Even fine-dining facilities clocked huge numbers,” said mall general manager K Vijayan. Only Quest, positioned as a premium mall, recorded footfall and sales that were lower than that of the Puja in 2019. Though footfall was 50% higher than last Puja, it was still 20% short of the figures recorded in 2019. With Pujas over, the malls expect business to dip over the next 10-12 days before it picks up prior to Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malls-see-record-puja-crowd-sales/articleshow/87091108.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Inspecting the site, the municipal administration, urban and water supply minister K N Nehru on Sunday said that the college would temporarily function from the Kallakudi Dalmia school complex. The site, which is situated on Trichy-Jayankondam highway at Muthuvathur village, will help both the rural students of Trichy and Ariyalur districts to pursue higher education, officials said. Access to bus stops for reaching Trichy, Lalgudi and Jayankondam were cited as the advantages of the site chosen. “The college requires only 5 acres of land, but we have identified 12 acres for a spacious complex. Soon after a G.O. is released, we will commence the construction work for temporary classrooms in the Muthuvathur site,” Lalgudi MLA A Soundarapandian said. The MLA also added that construction work for the permanent building will commence within a period of six months. However, temporary classrooms ensuring the safety of the students will be established in vacant spaces as the construction will take around a year to conclude.

According to police, she was arrested from the house of her relative at Poovar where she was hiding. She was produced in the court and remanded into judicial custody. This is the second arrest by city police in a fund fraud case. Sreekaryam police earlier arrested Biju, the office attendant at the Sreekaryam zonal office. Sunitha and Biju were under suspension. Meanwhile, Santhi, the charge officer who was suspended along with Sunitha pertaining to fund irregularities, was denied bail by the court. The police hinted that they are focusing solely on Sunitha. Sunitha had earlier furnished a list of staff members’ names to the corporation secretary who had carried money from the corporation office to the bank in the past one year. The police and the internal probe team constituted by the city corporation have, however, maintained that it was Sunitha who was primarily responsible for the fund fraud. In the complaint filed by the corporation secretary to the police, it was cited that the revenue income collected over a period of 25 days between January 24, 2020, and July 14, 2021 was missing from the corporation’s bank account. The missing amount was estimated to be Rs 26.7 lakhs. The corporation secretary in his complaint demanded a probe against both Santhi and Sunitha for forgery, embezzlement and cheating. The police have so far limited the probe to Sunitha and in the past few days launched a series of inspections in the houses of Sunitha’s relatives. Mayor Arya Rajendran, who has been facing flak over the fund fraud, issued a press note on Saturday declaring a second arrest in the case. She said in the release that the corporation has directed police to expedite further legal procedures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nemom-office-cashier-held-in-fund-fraud-case/articleshow/87070210.cms||---

A KSRTC conductor has been hailed as a hero after he rushed out from his bus and pulled them out to safety with the help of local residents from the flowing debris. The KSRTC bus running on the Kanayankavayal-Mundakayam-Erumeli route was caught up in the flash flood when it reached Pullupara checkpost. “We saw a huge amount of water coming down from the hill soon after a landslip. The road was filled with boulders and mud. We stopped the bus on the roadside as we could not go any further,” said Jaison Jospeh, the KSRTC bus conductor. “Looking out of the window I saw two people being washed away down the road in another mudslip that had occurred a little behind us. I could make out it was man and a child. I rushed out and managed to drag them to the bus with the help of KT Thomas, the driver and other passengers. It was a three-member family from north India whose rented vehicle had got trapped in the rubble. The woman was trapped below the bus but as her leg had got stuck in the rubble we could not pull her out.

---||Trichy||Water supplied by Trichy corpn found unfit for drinking||Trichy: Sending jitters to Trichy residents, a laboratory test conducted on drinking water samples collected from four different residential locations near Trichy airport has revealed that the water supplied by the city corporation is not suitable for consumption. The test report issued by the district public health laboratory concluded that all four samples had the presence of coliform bacteria. Official sources said cases of typhoid and suspected jaundice were reported in ward number 37 in Ponmalai zone covering areas adjoining Pudukottai NH, Wireless Road and KK Nagar near the airport. Suspecting poor water quality, Trichy corporation on October 12 collected the four water samples including from corporation water taps in households, a public street and near the overhead water tank. The test result, a copy of which is with TOI, revealed on October 16 that all four samples have coliform bacteria as a result of possible sewage contamination of drinking water. Apart from individual household water taps, a public water tap of Trichy corporation from where residents in bulk collect water was also found contaminated. Possibly, a large section of the population in the localities had consumed the contaminated water. The report from the public health lab in Manapparai has suggested cleaning the overhead water tanks. There are about 140 overhead tanks (OHT) in the city. Since most parts of the wards are supplied water from a common tank, questions are raised about the quality of water in other areas. “Not all families can afford RO water system. Trichy corporation must check water quality in other corporation wards too,” H Ghouse Baig, a consumer activist said. The civic body has stepped up the chlorination process to neutralise bacteria in drinking water. “We are conducting fever camps in the vulnerable streets. Residents have been advised to drink boiled water. Underground contamination, if any, will be addressed. Water tanks are being cleaned,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/water-supplied-by-trichy-corpn-found-unfit-for-drinking/articleshow/87093308.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Chandigarh||Police dept bars cops from contacting accounts branch officials||Pawan.Tiwari 1 Chandigarh: UT police department has issued an order that forbidding police officials from contacting the dealing assistant of the accounts branch at police headquarters in Sector 9 from now. This comes in the wake of a salary scam of Rs 1.1 crore unearthed in the department. The UT police crime branch arrested a junior assistant and former in-charge of the salary branch as well as a home guard volunteer in the scam. The order issued by SSP, headquarters Manoj Meena says that police personnel can only visit the account branch on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 12pm and 1pm for their personal work. However, cops can meet only the superintendent, Accounts branch, as he has been nominated as the nodal officer, the SSP’s order state. The order prohibits police personnel from contacting any dealing assistant of the account department. If any police personnel is found in the account branch, contacting dealing officials without permission, disciplinary action will be initiated. Police personnel are to raise their queries with the superintendent, account branch, who will take information from the dealing assistant and revert. The order has left many police personnel unhappy. Describing it as a “Tughlaqi” decree, they expressed the apprehension that it would make it very difficult for cops of the rank of constables and head constables to get their issues resolved by the accounts branch. Now, police personnel will have to wait for designated days to ascertain the status of their LTC applications, salary discrepancies and other issues. A constable rank employee said they already need to track dealing assistants to ascertain the status of their applications in the account branch for several days. Cops have to wait for around 2 months to get their LTC applications passed despite senior officials saying that these would be passed within 15 days, said a constable. The case: The crime branch arrested Balwinder Kumar, junior assistant and then in-charge of the salary branch at police headquarters on September 11, 2021 in the Rs 1.1 crore salary scam. During investigations, the crime branch found that around 161 police personnel got extra money in their accounts. Most of them informed the accounts department and returned it. However, 64 police personnel, in connivance with accounts branch officials, kept quiet. The accounts branch officials allegedly took a share of the extra salary credited to their accounts. This led to a fraud of over Rs 1.1 crore between 2016 and 2019. However, the police department started recovering the extra money disbursed and almost 100% of it has been reclaimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-dept-bars-cops-from-contacting-accounts-branch-officials/articleshow/87091146.cms||Pawan Tiwari

---||Trichy||Farmers using diesel pump sets seek fuel subsidy||Trichy: A section of farmers from the delta districts who have been using diesel motor pump sets for cultivation have urged the state government to announce a diesel subsidy for the ensuing samba paddy cultivation. To replace the existing oil pump sets, the state electricity board should allot a certain number of power connections to the farmers on a priority basis. The unprecedented hike in diesel prices has upset the farmers who take up cultivation using diesel motor pump sets. As the kuruvai paddy harvest is at its peak, several farmers have taken up samba paddy cultivation using Cauvery water. However, a considerable number of farmers in Lalgudi, Mannachanallur, Pullambadi blocks in Trichy district, Kumbakonam taluk in Thanjavur and several areas in Nagapattinam districts rely on diesel motor pump sets. Farmers are already struggling to carry out cultivation due to the escalation of input costs, fertilizer, seed and particularly labour costs. At this juncture, the increasing price of diesel on a daily basis has come as a shocker among the farmers. So, the government should announce fuel subsidies to the eligible farmers immediately, said G Srinivasan, a farmer from Ganapathi Agraharam in Thanjavur.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-using-diesel-pump-sets-seek-fuel-subsidy/articleshow/87093335.cms||---

Several popular outlets across Kolkata, both stand-alone and those in malls, said this was the first decent phase of very good business since March 2020 when everything had to be shut down due to the pandemic. This Durga Puja, a large number of bars and pubs had applied for permission for extended hours hoping for good business. And the result wasn’t disappointing. “Business was very good this Puja and we can say it was on a par with the Puja in 2019. The place would start filling up by late afternoon and we had guests till 1am,” said Debayan Datta, manager at Irish House in Quest Mall. A lot of bars and pubs had big groups of family and friends coming in together. “We had been getting smaller groups earlier. What stood out during the last six to seven days was that the groups were bigger and people were more relaxed. The average time people spend in the establishment and the billing amount also went up. Vaccination has, to a large extent, made people more confident,” said the manager of a Park Street pub. At Broadway Hotel on Ganesh Chandra Avenue, business was up by 50%-60% compared to the Puja in 2020. “We had big groups of youngsters coming in the late afternoon. Earlier, Navami would be the peak of Puja business, but this year the place was full almost every day. We do not have any big Puja in this neighbourhood, so people specifically came to spend time at Broadway,” said Sandeep Sehgal of Broadway Hotel. The crowds continued on the weekend too. “People who did not step out during the festival to avoid crowds are now coming to have a few drinks and eat,” said a representative of Amber in Chandni Chowk. Even the singing bars in central Kolkata registered brisk business. “We had taken permission to remain open till 2am and even at that time the place would be full. We had such good business for the first time since March 2020,” said the owner of a singing bar in Chandni Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-celebrate-first-phase-of-good-biz-since-mar-20/articleshow/87091180.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||Cat in transit from Bengaluru flees Kolkata airport, reunites with Silchar owner a fortnight later||KOLKATA: A cat that had disappeared from the city airport two weeks ago, after it had flown in with its pet parent from Bengaluru, was reunited with the owner on Saturday following a relentless search operation by Kolkata airport authorities and Air India officials. The 14-month-old feline, Dice, was finally rescued from a fire shaft at the airport basement on Friday. Dice had reached Kolkata on October 2, tucked inside a plastic cage in an Air India flight’s cargo hold, and had gone missing immediately after being brought down. His owner Mayurakshi Saha was travelling in the same flight with another cat in her cabin baggage and was informed that Dice had gone missing when she went to the cargo to collect him. The Air India cargo team had claimed the cat broke open the cage and escaped. Saha, along with the airline officials, airport authorities and CISF personnel, started a search on the airport premises. “Tears of joy rolled from my eyes when the airline officials handed Dice over to me. He looked frail and sick and I immediately took him to a vet who checked his vitals and put him on a high-protein diet for the time being. But I am sincerely thankful to the airport and airline authorities as they never gave up the search and managed to rescue Dice even when I had given up hope of ever seeing him again,” said Saha from her Silchar residence, where Air India authorities flew the cat to hand him over. Air India officials said the incident had left them sullen as they have been taking the utmost care for safe transport of pets for the past several years. “Team Air India continued its relentless search for the missing cat ever since it broke open its cage and escaped at the airport.With support from AAI and other agencies, our airport colleagues’ tireless efforts were rewarded when they were able to locate and catch the cat from the airport premises. It was taken care of and fed, and was returned to the owner in Silchar on Saturday,” said an Air India spokesperson. Sources said airport and airline authorities had distributed photographs of the cat on multiple WhatsApp groups, asking every employee to inform a set of officials the moment they spotted the feline. Cat food was also kept at multiple locations to lure it. “I have been told that while the food was getting eaten, the authorities weren’t able to locate the cat. But on Saturday, two officials spotted the cat in the basement and two Air India officials skipped their holiday to rush to the airport and rescued Dice who had snuck into an emergency fire shaft. The officials took all precautions while getting him out and he was flown back to Silchar. I can’t thank them enough,” said Saha, who had been in Kolkata for a week to look for Dice at the airport after he disappeared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cat-rescued-from-airport-two-weeks-after-escaping-from-cage-reunited-with-owner/articleshow/87091209.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Many who have got calls to rejoin work are forced to shell out Rs 16,000 to Rs 40,000 one-way and also quarantine costs running into lakhs once they land in UAE, Qatar or other countries in the Middle East. A good number of people hailing from areas in central and southern parts of the state work as labourers in the Middle East. About 2.14 lakh passengers working abroad have arrived via Trichy airport, but only 10% to 20% are able to go back to join duty, say travel agents. Workers who tried to go back in August and September have found that the fare was about 50% more than pre-Covid days. “The total cost will cross Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.20 lakh when quarantine charges are also added,” said a passenger. According to the present schedule from Trichy, the fare ranges from Rs 16,000 to Rs 17,700 to Sharjah, Rs 21,000 to Rs 29,700 to Dubai, Rs 46,000 to Muscat. The fares are higher from Chennai because the number of transit travellers, especially students, who fly via UAE to Europe and the UK is high. Air India Express and IndiGo operate 31 flights to the Middle East in a week from Trichy under Vande Bharat Mission and air bubble agreements. There are around 20 flights in a week from Chennai to destinations in the Middle East. S Bhaskar of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) said that the fare is higher than the usual price because of fewer flights. This has forced travel agents, tour companies and the passengers associations to urge the government to restart scheduled international flights so that higher frequency of flights will bring down air fare. Kings Ziauddin, member of Kuwait-Tamil Islamic Community (K-Tic) working for the welfare of Tamils working in Gulf countries said thousands of workers hailing from Trichy and central districts have returned from abroad after losing their jobs. Some are in a position to go back, but they are unable to meet the quarantine charges and high air fare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/air-fares-many-unable-to-return-to-work-abroad/articleshow/87093341.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

---||Goa||Otavane, the cultural bridge linking Goa to Sawantwadi||KERI: Otavane village of Sawantwadi attracts several Goans to its Dussehra celebration as it traces its roots to the dynasty of Sawantwadkar Bhosles, who once ruled over Bicholim, Sattari and Pernem. The 9th day of the first fortnight of Ashwin is celebrated as Mahanavami in Otavane's Ravalnath temple -- the presiding deity of the village. On the occasion, the festive insignias called Tarangas of Sateri, Kulacho Purvas and Ravalnath are draped with 9-yard sarees and adorned with golden ornaments brought from the treasury of Sawantwadi. A palm replica of metal, representing Ravalnath, and two metal masks representing Sateri and Kulacho Purvas are installed at the top of the insignias. Amid the drumming of folk music instruments such as dhol and taso, a symbolic marriage ceremony termed ‘Shivlagna’ of Ravalnath with Sateri and Kalaka devi is held. Thereafter, leaves of Aapta (Bauhinia racemosa) are exchanged among devotees visualising it as gold. A tarang (insignia) of Kulacho Purvas is taken in procession to the Samadhi (tomb) of Khem Sawant Otavanekar, the 17th century ruler of Sawantwadi state. This Samadhi is situated at the confluence of Gad nadi (river) with Dabil nadi (river) which later converge and form Terekhol river flowing towards Goa. On Dussehra evening, a devotee of Ravlanath gets obsessed with divine intervention, it is believed. In deep trance and meditative state, the possessed devotee blesses people from far and wide including from Goa. Anant Shantaram Gaonkar from Otavane speaking to TOI said, “Once, Pernem, Bicholim and Sattari talukas were under the state of Sawantwadi. Devotees use to throng in large numbers to pay their gratitude to Ravalnath and get blessings." Deities such as Ravalnath along with Sateri, Bhagwati, Kalakadevi, Kshetrapal, Vetal, Jeshtadevi, Mharingan and Mahadev are worshipped here. However, Ravalnath is considered as the guardian deity who protects villagers from natural disasters, social evils and witchcrafts. That is why the deity is popular among most of the social classes in Otavane and vicinity. Dussehra celebration of Otavane reflects not only the socio-cultural heritage, but the history of bygone days linked to the rulers of Sawantwadi, who used to worship Ravalnath as the presiding deity of their family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/otavane-the-cultural-bridge-linking-goa-to-sawantwadi/articleshow/87093511.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Ahmedabad||Bapu ashram: Toehold for stakeholders in restoration||AHMEDABAD: Seven months after constituting the Gandhi Ashram Precinct Development, for the purpose of redeveloping the Gandhi Ashram precinct, its governing council, has invited Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (SAPMT) to develop a concept note on the interpretation and exhibition and the experience a visitor will have when they visit the Ashram, and the larger proposed area of more than 55 acres. SAPMT manages the three acres on which stands the Hriday Kunj, Bapu’s home, the Gandhi archives and the museum designed by architect Charles Correa among several other buildings. Originally the Ashram precinct had spread over 120 acres and then in 1960s six trusts were formed to manage the Ashram affairs. “The SAPMT proposes to develop this concept note through an open process which is inclusive of various groups, institutions and individuals concerned with the future development of the Ashram. All six trusts that are in charge of different activities and areas in the ashram have been meeting time to time to discuss the concepts, express their concerns and give their suggestions,” claimed a press release form the Sabarmati Ashram. The trustees of the SAPMT also met the representatives of the Gandhi Peace Foundation, Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Sarva Seva Sangh, Sewagram, National Gandhi Museum, nai Talim association, National Youth Organization along with other concerned citizens and taken heed to their concerns, claims the SAPMT press release. These bodies were to begin a protest rally on Sunday from Pune which would have culminated at the Sabarmati Ashram on October 24. The protest yatra is called ‘Sewagram-Sabarmati Chetna Jagran Yatra’ led by the Sarva Seva Sangh to protest against redevelopment plan. “We feel that with the official invitation from the council for consultation and development of the concept note and a dialogue with the authorities should be able to clear the misunderstandings and lead to a restoration which would befit the memory of Gandhiji,” claimed an official press release by the SAPMT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bapu-ashram-toehold-for-stakeholders-in-restoration/articleshow/87091317.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Discoms in Rajasthan send messages of power cut||JAIPUR: Discoms in the state have started sending alerts to the electricity consumers that it is likely that there will be load shedding because the power plants are facing coal shortage and generation has taken a hit. They have appealed people to avoid unnecessary use of electricity. While the cloudy conditions have reduced the demand for power, it is not enough to compensate for the loss of electricity generation. It seems the efforts of the state have failed to raise the coal supply from the subsidiaries of Coal India. After meeting senior officials in New Delhi on October 13, a senior energy department official had said that coal supply has increased to 20 rakes. He said that Coal India’s two subsidiaries had dispatched eight rakes and combined with 12 rakes from the state’s own mine (PKCL) operated by Adani, the total capacity has reached 20 rakes. The state needs 19 rakes coal to fire all its thermal plants, as per senior officials. But in contrary, a government release after the chief minister’s review of the power situation on October 17 stated that coal supplies from Coal India’s subsidiaries remain at 5-6 rakes. In fact, the government release said that the state is getting only 11 rakes from PKCL mines instead of 12. There may be some breather as power rates on the exchange have come down to an average price of Rs 9 a unit from Rs 13 two days ago due to rains and cloudy weather conditions. But it seems as soon as the temperature rises, buying power from the exchanges will not be cheaper. Some in the energy deartment say, the power purchase deals between the state government and the sellers on the exchange are not transparent. Officials have used the loopholes to their advantage even though the benefits don’t come to the state. Energy department officials have said that the situation has improved from around eight days ago, but blackouts cannot be ruled out. The message from the discoms clearly shows that the decked up bazaars are unlikely to avoid darkness at some point of the days in the coming weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/discoms-in-state-send-messages-of-power-cut/articleshow/87121438.cms||---
---||Kolkata||SI dies during kidnap probe, colleagues rescue 3-year-old||Kolkata: Sub-inspector Sheikh Aftab Ahmed, second officer of Ultadanga police station, suffered a cardiac arrest and died on October 13 while probing a kidnapping case. Nearly 72 hours later, his colleagues stepped in to complete the investigation and managed to reunite the abducted three-year-old with her mother on Saturday. When Ahmed suffered the heart attack, he was questioning the victim’s uncle, a key suspect. He had been pursuing the case relentlessly since the child’s father, who runs a small business on Ultadanga Canal Road, had lodged the complaint on October 9. Ahmed’s colleagues said he was personally involved with the case since he had a child of the same age. “He had begun sweating profusely on Saptami evening, October 12. Senior officers immediately got him admitted to a private hospital. Ahmed kept repeating that he was close to solving the case and that, as a father of two children himself, he had promised the child’s mother that he would rescue her. He was certain a relative was involved,” said a colleague who didn’t wish to be named. Ahmed was able to zero in on the suspect and pin down the possible motive. The child’s uncle, Md Amin, reportedly confessed that he had kidnapped her over a monetary dispute with the victim’s father. It was then that Ahmed’s colleagues, both in Ultadanga and in the Detective Department’s missing persons squad, stepped in to pursue his leads. “During subsequent questioning, the child’s uncle kept saying he had left her at a Durga Puja pandal in Howrah’s Uluberia,” an officer said. “The Puja organisers had found the child, but she could not tell them where she was from. After the organizers failed to trace her parents, they handed her over to the police. This led Ultadanga cops to Uluberia,” said an officer. Kolkata Police took to Facebook to condole Ahmed’s demise and stand by his family in this hour of crisis. Ahmed, a police source said, was only 41 and is survived by his wife and two children. “Having joined Kolkata Police in 2008, Aftab made a name for himself as an extremely competent officer and was posted to Garden Reach, Narkeldanga, and Entally police stations before his last posting at Ultadanga. Some vacuums remain forever unfilled,” Kolkata Police wrote on their Facebook page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/si-dies-during-kidnap-probe-colleagues-rescue-3-year-old/articleshow/87091244.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||9 mths on, vax delivers safety; Vid closer to herd immunity||Nagpur: Nine months after Covid-19 vaccination started across the country on January 17, 2021, the drive has turned out to be full of achievements when it comes to vaccine efficacy, safety, and mass-inoculation programmes. As far as Vidarbha region is concerned, more than 63% of the eligible population (over 18 years) has already got at least one jab. More than 27% of eligible population have already received both doses of the vaccine and gained major protection against the serious Covid-19 disease. Experts and researchers told TOI that the region is comfortably heading towards the status of herd immunity with the combination of vaccine and virus exposure. As per official figures, On January 17, total 1% of Vid Population (2.65 lakh) were officially infected by Covid-19. After 9 months on October 17, nearly 5% of the population (11.19 lakh) are officially infected. As per ICMR, the actual number of people exposed to Covid-19 is at least three times more than the official figures. So, nearly 20% population of Vidarbha has already got infected at some or the other stage of the first or second wave. “Herd immunity is achieved either through infection and recovery or by vaccination. Herd immunity also protects those who are unable to be vaccinated because the disease spread within the population is very limited. We are experiencing the same phase at present in Vidarbha,” said epidemiologist Anand Thatte. “The proportion of a population who must be immune to achieve herd immunity varies by disease. As far as Covid-19 is concerned, we require more than 70% population immune, the figure we must have already surpassed,” he added. While the figure of immune population this is not officially declared by any government agency, a recent sero survey conducted by Nagpur’s Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) has found near 80% sero-positivity in random samples collected in Nagpur district. “Our blood sample-based sero survey shows over 70% Nagpurians had Covid-19 infection. Out of non-vaccinated subjects, 70% had natural antibodies while out of vaccinated subjects, 85% plus had antibodies,” said Dr Rajpal S Kashyap, senior scientist and director research of CIIMS. The official sero survey of Nagpur district is being conducted by the divisional health authorities. On January 17, Vidarbha region had 7,393 patients of Covid-19. On October 17, only 108 patients are having Covid-19 and undergoing treatment. This shows, a large chunk of population is safe. However, the major obstacle in achievement of herd immunity is unvaccinated pockets of population. “Vaccine has worked for us. Now, the better idea is to find out unvaccinated pockets and target vaccines and achieve more than 90% coverage,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. Government authorities told TOI that there are several pockets in Vidarbha where vaccination is still a taboo. “In Akola, less than 50% population is vaccinated with at least one dose despite all efforts. Less than 23% of eligible population has got both the doses,” said a senior official from the Akola GMCH adding that unvaccinated pockets are being shortlisted and major drives will be launched soon in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/9-mths-on-vax-delivers-safety-vid-closer-to-herd-immunity/articleshow/87091291.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The doctor, Maitri Panwar, had checked into the hotel to celebrate her birthday on Friday along with four of her friends. Three of the women friends who were with her were her college mates in medical school while a male friend had come from Gurgaon for the party, police said. Her friends told police that they were partying till late in the night and found her dead when they woke up in the morning.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Digha-Bakkhali hotels full in post-Puja weekend||DIGHA/BAKKHALI: Digha in East Midnapore and Bakkhali-Frasergunj in South 24 Parganas are overflowing with tourists during this weekend of extended puja holidays. For the first time in the last two years, hotels, holiday homes and guest houses are refusing tourists as occupancy has reached 100 percent. After staying indoors for over a year, tourists started hitting these popular tourist destinations with a vengeance. However, this weekend turned out to be a tourism bonanza for hoteliers and tour operators at Digha and Bakkhali.  “After spending the Pujas at home, people have come straight to Digha, Shankarpur and Tajpur armed with vaccination reports or Covid negative reports. This is great news for our business,” said an elated Biprodas Chatterjee, joint secretary, Digha Hoteliers’ Association. Tapan Biswas from Behala said, “I had made an advance booking, sensing a rush. We did pandal hopping till Navami and headed straight to Digha. We will return on Monday.” However, most of the tourists have complained of connectivity issues. The internet speed is very slow. “We cannot share our photographs and videos with our loved ones back home,” he added. Sources said that torrential rain and breaching of embankment of Keleghai river have led to power disruption in 48 towers. The supply of power to the towers was resumed with the help of gensets. But the problem has persisted, said a mobile company official. However, East Midnapore Mobile Tower Employees Union leader and Patashpur MLA Uttam Barik said, “I am not aware of the development but will certainly look into it.” At Bakkhali-Frasergunj, similar overcrowding could be witnessed. Tourists started coming in hoards after Dashami. “In fact we had to refuse tourists as all our rooms got booked. But understanding the financial stress of common people due to the pandemic, we didn’t revise our tariffs. We are charging what we used to charge two years ago as we want a revival of tourism throughout the year,” said Biswajit Mondal, a hotel owner. Mousuni Island and Pakhiralay witnessed the maximum tourist influx. However, the adverse weather system has left many worried. “We are facing the fury of nature too frequently. If there is a cyclone now, an inundation follows. We are praying that nature gets a bit pacified so that we can survive,” said Amirul Midday, secretary, Boat Operators’ Association. Boat Operators take tourists around the sea and parts of the Sunderbans where tourism is allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-monotosh-digha-bakkhali/articleshow/87091332.cms||Suman Mondal
---||Ranchi||IMD issues yellow alert in Jharkhand for next 3 days||Ranchi: After a wet spell at the beginning of October followed by a dry spell during the Durga Puja, Jharkhand is all set to receive widespread rainfall during the next 72 hours with the IMD issuing a yellow category alert in the state for the next three days. IMD, Ranchi, head Abhishek Anand said the state is likely to have light to moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms during the next three days resulting from a low-pressure area over north Telangana and its neighbourhood with associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 5.8km above the mean sea level tilting southwestwards with height. Under the influence of the system, Jharkhand has already started receiving rainfall since Saturday night. The maximum rainfall of 19.8mm was recorded at the Moharo weather station of Dumka district while light to moderate rainfall was reported from several other automatic weather stations across the state. Anand said south Easterly winds were entering Jharkhand, loaded with moisture as an effect of the system. “The moisture incursion is likely to cause light to moderate rainfall during the next 24 hours in northern and central districts of the state. On Tuesday, chances of fairly widespread rainfall covering almost the entire state are there and likely to continue through Wednesday,” he said, adding that the rainfall activity is likely to reduce from Thursday. Overall, Jharkhand received a good quantum of rainfall with a near-normal monsoon and a negligible departure of 1% below normal this year. The post-monsoon rain, though uneven in terms of spatial distribution, has remained significantly high. As against a post-monsoon seasonal normal of 54.9mm rainfall, the state has received 67.3mm, indicating an excess of 23%. West Singhbhum with 152% extra rainfall has recorded a large excess. The district received 121mm rainfall as against a normal of 48.1mm followed by Deoghar with 124% extra rainfall. In contrast, Pakur district has recorded a mere 7.3mm rainfall as against a normal of 97.9mm, indicating a shortfall of 93%. The IMD forecast also said the day temperature is set to fall because of the continuous rainfall and overcast sky. As of date, the maximum temperature in most of the districts remained 2-3 notches above normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/imd-issues-yellow-alert-in-jharkhand-for-next-3-days/articleshow/87091284.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Nagpur||2 yrs on, MVA yet to release funds for works okayed by Fadnavis govt||Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government (MVA) is yet to release funds for development works in the city sanctioned by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led regime two years ago. As a result, 54 works are stalled midway. After a change of guard in the state, the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government stopped Rs169.31 crore funds sanctioned by Fadnavis, then chief minister, for various projects in the city. A senior official from NMC’s public works department confirmed that many works, mostly cement roads, started during the Fadnavis regime were stopped due to paucity of funds. He told TOI when Fadnavis was the CM, NMC had proposed 93 development works across the city and sought Rs209.37 crore funds. However, the government had sanctioned 91 works worth Rs169.31 crore. Though Fadnavis became CM in 2014, most of the works were sanctioned by the state government either in 2018 or 2019. With the hope of getting funds from the state government, NMC too had started most of the works, including rejuvenation of Sakkardara Lake, cement road in Khamla, and phase-III cement road works among others. Citing an example, the official said for 85 different works, the civic body had received a go-ahead from the previous state government. It also got an approval of Rs96.96 crore funds for these works. The Fadnavis government had also released Rs33.42 crore to NMC. Other major works which have been stalled include Rs11.9 crore for constructing Sahakar Nagar bridge, Rs14 crore for widening of bridge on Ayodhya Nagar to Manewada ring road near Jambudweep Nagar and construction of Wathoda crematorium. The MVA government also stopped a special grant of Rs25 crore for Nagpur started by Fadnavis. Senior BJP leaders claimed that withholding works from the funds sanctioned by the previous government has put Nagpurians to inconvenience. NMC has already done several follow-ups with the government urging to release funds for the held-up works, but in vain, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-yrs-on-mva-yet-to-release-funds-for-works-okayed-by-fadnavis-govt/articleshow/87091307.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Ranchi||Maoists’ bandh hits rural pockets||Ranchi/Palamu: The day-long bandh called by CPI (Maoist) in four states on Sunday to protest the killing of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on October 3 evoked a mixed response in Jharkhand with the rural areas being the most affected parts. Inspector general (operations) and Jharkhand Police spokesperson Amol Homkar said the bandh was peaceful in the state. “Security had been enhanced at vital installations, including national highways, state highways and government projects. The police force carried out operations throughout the day,” he said. The bandh impacted bus services in Ranchi with only around 40% of the public transport vehicles plying on the roads. Ranchi Bus Owners’ Association president Kishore Mantri said, “Our buses did not ply from Simdega to Chaibasa. However, a few bus owners operated their vehicles to Hazaribag and Jamshedpur. Most of the owners decided not to operate their vehicles out of fear of the extremists.” The bandh did not have any impact on train services in the Ranchi area. A Railway Protection Force (RPF) officer said the train services were smooth but the security was tight. In rural areas, markets and other commercial establishments were closed. In Khunti’s urban and semi-urban areas, shops were closed. A similar situation was witnessed in Bundu area of Ranchi district. The movement of vehicles was significantly less than normal in Simdega district. In Gumla, several shops were closed because of Sunday. The Betla National Park in Palamu remained shut for a few hours and many visitors were stranded, but officials clarified that it was not because of the bandh. The deputy director (north division) of the park, Kumar Ashish, said, “It is just a coincidence that the park was made inaccessible to visitors for a few hours in the morning. Some work was going on and it was misconstrued that the park was shut because of the bandh.” Meanwhile, Maoist spokesperson Manas claimed that the bandh was widely successful and people from different walks of life supported it. He said small and medium traders, vehicle owners and intellectuals played a praiseworthy role in ensuring the bandh’s success. He added that the anger aroused out of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident could not end with a single bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-bandh-hits-rural-pockets/articleshow/87091403.cms||Sanjay Sahay

MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar said that MGP has decided to contest the assembly elections independently. “We have shortlisted 12 candidates, and in the next few days, eight more candidates will be shortlisted,” he said. “We will not form an alliance with BJP and have not started alliance talks with them.” He said that MGP is trying to form the next government, and that people should not fall prey to rumours of an alliance with BIP. Reacting to BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade’s invitation, he said that BJP has purchased MLAs (in the past), and now they have realised that they want an alliance. Senior MGP functionary Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said that whenever BJP formed the state government since 1999, he has had a big role in forming those governments. “BJP has backstabbed us on three occasions, and we cannot forget this. We have to think very seriously, else it would be like committing suicide,” he said. He said that MGP would not compromise on the 12 seats it has already prepared candidates for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/alliance-with-bjp-would-be-like-suicide-says-mgp/articleshow/87093465.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Plaint against BJP leader for remark against minorities||JAMSHEDPUR: Senior JMM leader Babar Khan has filed a written complaint against senior BJP leader Abhay Singh with the Sakchi police station in Jamshedpur for allegedly hurting the sentiments of the minority communities. In his complaint, Khan alleged that Singh had charged the minority communities with encroaching land to construct mosques at various places in the Steel City and claimed that the administration has turned a blind eye to the issue. Sakchi police station officer-in-charge Rajesh Singh said, “A complaint has been filed by Khan against Singh. We will take the next step only after a thorough probe of the whole matter. If the complaint is found true, then action would be taken against Singh.” Notably, Singh reportedly made the encroachment charge during a heated exchange with East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar at a Durga Puja pandal recently. The exchange was caught on video which went viral on social media. Sources said the DC was stopping bhog distribution for not following protocols at a pandal in Kasidih where Singh was head of the organising committee. Singh said the DC was hurting the religious sentiments of the devotees at the pandal and claimed that all Covid protocols were followed. The BJP leader also sought a clarification from the DC, claiming that the administration was disturbing the Puja at the pandal for no reason. It was during this exchange that Singh told Kumar that many mosques in the city were constructed on encroached land while the state government and the local administration were not taking any action. He also claimed that the administration is giving a step-motherly treatment to the Hindu community by banning bhog distribution. Taking a strong offence to Singh’s comments, Khan along with his supporters went to the Sakchi police station and lodged a written complaint. Khan demanded that Singh must be arrested immediately and an FIR be filed against him. Singh, however, said he will stick to the remarks he had made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/plaint-against-bjp-leader-for-remark-against-minorities/articleshow/87091444.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Vadodara||Gujarat’s indigenous craft to get fresh lease of life||VADODARA: The languishing craft of weaving mashru, an indigenous fabric of Gujarat having its roots in Patan and Kutch, will get a fresh lease of life. Researchers at M S University’s Department of Clothing and Textiles are trying to rejuvenate the craft with design and product diversification. “We all know about celebrated handloom fabrics like brocade and ikat. Mashru is a beautiful bliss of these two fabric techniques. This functional fabric is very suitable as per the climatic condition of hot regions,” said Priyanka Kumari, who took up the project as part of her PhD under guidance of professor Anjali Karolia.  At present, mashru is mainly made in combination of rayon and cotton in Patan and cotton by cotton in few villages of Kutch.  Kumari has developed multiple varieties of mashru including mulberry silk by cotton, tasar silk by cotton, korea silk by cotton along with existing varieties. At the same time, she has tried to reintroduce lost techniques of mashru.  “Long back, ikat and brocade ‘buttis’ were the characterizing features of this craft. Unfortunately, at present use of these is not seen. It is commonly identified by its stripe pattern,” said Kumari, who with the help of Patan-based mashru weaver has even prepared men’s wear, kids wear, office wear, furnishings to provide a wider market to mashru.  Weaving is usually considered as men’s task. “However, women mashru weavers of Patan have proved it as an obsolete notion. They had headed towards economic empowerment in their traditional setting. But with few mashru weavers left in Patan, it needs to be strengthened. The numbers of mashru weavers are very less in Kutch as well. Its strengthening can be done with active participation of weavers and its promotion among people,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gujarats-indigenous-craft-to-get-fresh-lease-of-life/articleshow/87089673.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Ranchi||Over 12 lakh in state missed deadline for second Cov jab||Ranchi: In order to improve the vaccination coverage which has been hit during Navratri, the state health department has directed all deputy commissioners to eliminate the backlog and meet the daily targets. The order has come in the wake of a national review by the Union health minister on Covid vaccination status on October 9, 2021 in which it was decided to reinvigorate the drive for beneficiaries on priority basis. According to the state health department records, a total of 12,48,190 beneficiaries across the state are waiting for their second doses, which include 8,61,651 of those who have taken Covishield and 3,86,539 who have taken Covaxin. Giridih and Palamu has the maximum number of overdue beneficiaries which are 1,05,873 and 1,05,457 respectively. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “It has come to our notice that over 12 lakh beneficiaries across various categories are overdue for their vaccine doses during the past 84 days. This has come to the fore as districts haven’t been able to meet their daily targets of vaccination which has been cumulatively set at 3 lakh doses across the state.” Singh, through a letter, has directed the deputy commissioners to ensure that they meet the daily targets and suggested a slew of measures through which to do so. According to Singh’s letter, the officials have been asked to do micro planning of eligible beneficiaries above 18 years of age and should work towards bringing them to the nearest vaccine centres. Apart from that, special three-day weekend vaccination drives should be organised in order to improve the numbers and it should be carried out from the district to the panchayat levels. In order to increase coverage in rural as well as far-off interior areas, the DCs have been asked to utilise the mobile vaccination vans. Asked whether the gap will affect the efficacy of the vaccine, public health expert and professor of community medicine, Dr Dewesh Kumar, said it would not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/over-12-lakh-in-state-missed-deadline-for-second-cov-jab/articleshow/87091347.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Nagpur||AAP protests after Umred MLA ‘fixes’ union activities, low wages for women||Nagpur: Congress MLA from Umred Raju Parwe claimed at an event on Friday that he fixed low wages for women workers at incense stick units, and had also put a stop to all union activities in the industrial area, to boost entrepreneurship. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has claimed the wages quoted by Parwe are less than the mandatory minimum wage payable to factory workers. At a programme to hand over incense stick manufacturing units to entrepreneurs, chief guest Parwe said, “We held a meeting and decided the monthly wage for women in these factories. Around 1,000 women have got employment. In case of the city, the daily wage of women is around Rs400-500 per day. Here, women are going to work at a salary of only Rs6,000 per month. Women workers have been made available at less cost.” TOI has a video of Parwe’s entire speech. AAP activist Pratap Goswami slammed Parwe for the speech. “It is a brazen violation of bylaws of the Central government. Workers are supposed to get minimum wage of Rs8,500 to Rs11,000 per month as per policy of the government. They are also entitled to provident fund, insurance, dearness allowance etc. A legislator cannot take decisions that women are going to work at less than minimum wage.” Goswami added, “A cluster of 40 incense stick manufacturing units has been developed at Umred under government scheme. All units will get subsidy of Rs10 lakh each and total Rs5 crore have been allotted for procurement of machinery. Therefore, anything below minimum wage for women is not justified.” In his speech, Parwe also claimed to have ended all activities of unions, including rallies in Umred industrial area. “There will be no problems for entrepreneurs,” Parwe said. Goswami said, “Congress itself runs unions in the name of INTUC across the country. It is the right of workers to form a union and raise their demands to get justice, and for their welfare and development. A legislator claiming to have ended all union activities itself is an injustice towards workers, and bad in law.” Parwe did not respond to TOI’s calls or message.

---||Goa||Salgaocar’s first of many||Like every Goan, the love of football coursed through Vasudev Mahadeva Salgaocar’s veins. After establishing himself in the business world, his group -- House of Salgaocar -- earned the distinction of becoming the first business house to start a football team in the state. From Vimson (an abbreviation of V M Salgaocar & Sons) in 1956 to Salgaocar Sports Club, the club dominated at home and won plenty of honours, but a major outstation trophy eluded them. For more than 20 years, all that remained in the cabinet was the Nagpur Rovers Cup. There were narrow misses. In 1975, for example, Salgaocar were unlucky to have been knocked out in the final of both the Nizam Gold Cup and TNFA Shield. Two years later, they lost another final, this time at Bangalore, now Bengaluru, when they were defeated by Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) in the Puttaiah Memorial Cup. So, when Salgaocar travelled to Bengaluru for the next edition of Puttaiah Memorial in 1978, nobody knew what to expect. The Puttaiah Memorial always attracted the best teams from west and south India, but that year, the organisers – who relied heavily on gate collections -- were dealt a blow when Orkay Mills withdrew due to mounting injuries. Titanium from Kerala were brought in as replacement. ITI, not surprisingly, were the overwhelming favourites. They were more than just the defending champions. A year earlier, the Bengaluru side had won the inaugural Federation Cup in Ernakulam upsetting star-studded Mohun Bagan 1-0 in the final. Whichever tournament ITI took part after their most famous triumph, opponents looked at them with respect. Salgaocar couldn’t believe the draw when they were paired with ITI in the quarterfinal itself. Coached and managed by Henrique Britto, Salgaocar started well with wins against Shimoga Youngsters (6-0) and LRDE (Electronics and Radar Development Establishment, 1-0). Then they came face-to-face with the Champion Club of India for a place in the semifinal. “ITI were a really good side, among the strongest we faced,” said goalkeeper Brahmanand Shankhwalkar. “We were a young team, eager to make a mark. Nothing could have stopped us.” Nothing meant not even high-flying ITI, as Bento Endro scored the goal that eventually separated the two sides. The clash was not without its share of trouble as play had to be stopped when supporters invaded the field towards the fag end of the match and assaulted the referee. The supporters claimed time was already up, but after police chased them away, the referee -- despite a bleeding cheek – played the remaining three minutes. In the semi-final against Titanium, Salgaocar were held to a goalless draw in the first leg at the Rajinder Singh stadium, before Romeo Remedios’ powerful grounder made the difference in the reverse leg. The Goans had now booked their place in the final for the second consecutive year and guess who were waiting for them in the final? Vasco Sports Club. “The Salgaocar-Vasco rivalry was really fierce,” said Irineu Gonsalves, who played for both clubs. “Players were attacked (on the ground) in the past by supporters. The city was split with Vasco enjoying a slight advantage (in terms of support). The Puttaiah final not surprisingly became a big talking point.” Irineu was with Salgaocar when they lost the final the previous year against ITI. Now, he was wearing Vasco’s famous black and white colours, eager to settle scores, playing alongside star forwards like Jose Fernandes (captain) and Dominic Soares. “Salgaocar were clearly the better team. I would say far superior,” said Romeo, scorer of that memorable goal in the semis. On the field, though, the teams drew a blank. However hard they tried, none could break the deadlock, prompting spectators to wonder if the organisers had an arrangement with the teams to take this final into the next day and help them get more revenue through gate collection. “The misses from both sides were shocking. Neither team measured up to the challenge,” said Brahmanand. The next day when the final was replayed, Inacio Piedade Fernandes turned out to be an unlikely hero as his corner-kick brushed the hands of Vasco goalkeeper Alexinho Fernandes and sailed into the net. “Once we took the lead, there was no stopping us,” said captain and star midfielder Arnold Rodrigues. “We controlled the tempo of the game. There were times when Vasco gave us a hard time, but there was no way we were surrendering our lead.” Salgaocar didn’t, and went on to win 1-0. When Salgaocar returned home with the Puttaiah Memorial Cup, a red carpet was laid out for the players at the Dabolim airport with club chairman VM Salgaocar personally present to welcome the heroes. Having defeated Vasco in the final, the triumph was even sweeter. Salgaocar players were taken in a motorcade to Vasco with supporters bursting crackers all through the journey that fittingly culminated at the Salgaocar House.

Syed-ur-Rehman (25), a resident of Leh’s Turtuk village who was enrolled for a master’s degree course at Jamia, and his friend Mohammad Zaid, who ran a garments’ shop in Nuh, were travelling to Delhi around 11.30 am on a Royal Enfield when the motorcycle apparently lost balance and hit the parapet wall of the flyover, police said. The duo fell 20 feet down on the highway below, they added. Eyewitnesses have told police that one of the men landed atop a Wagon R car passing below the flyover while the other landed beside it. Both the victims were rushed to a nearby private hospital in an autorickshaw by the on-duty traffic police personnel. While Rehman was declared dead on arrival, Zaid succumbed to his injuries around 8.30pm while undergoing treatment. “The bike had hit the wall (of the flyover), which is 2-2.5 feet tall, and the men fell down. Zaid was in a serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and there seemed to be little chance of his survival. The motorcy-cle, however, was not damaged in the incident,” an investigating officer said, adding that families of both the victims have been informed. “While Zaid’s family has reached the hospital, Rehman’s family is likely to reach Delhi on Monday,” the officer added. The Ladakh police are in touch with Rehman’s family and will assist them with formalities at the hospital and funeral rites. According to police, Rehman had gone to Nuh to attend a function and was returning to Delhi with Zaid to make some purchases. The duo had come to know each other during their graduation, police added. In August, at least three persons had died within a span of 24 hours in two separate incidents, police said. The first accident had been reported on KundliManesar-Palwal Expressway and the second in Sohna when a speeding truck rammed a car. In another incident, a 24-year-old woman had died after a dumper truck rammed a vehicle she was travelling in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bike-hits-wall-of-iffco-chowk-flyover-jamia-student-among-2-dead/articleshow/87091702.cms||Sagrika Kissu

Meanwhile, the Haryana Police also set up two special investigation teams to probe the incident. Narayan Singh was arrested from near Amritsar, while Govind Singh and Bhagwant Singh, from Fatehgarh Sahib, had “surrendered” before the Sonipat police on Saturday in connection with the lynching of Lakhbir Singh, a 35-year-old Tarn Taran man, whose body was found with wounds and a severed left arm on Friday morning. Another accused Sarvajeet Singh, who was nabbed by police from Sonipat’s Kundli on Friday evening, has already been sent to seven-day police custody. In the court, all the three accused admitted to having killed Lakhbir for desecrating the Sikh holy book. Narayan said he had chopped off the victim’s leg while Sarabjeet severed his hand. They submitted that no other person was involved in the murder, but four of them. One of the SITs headed by IPS officer Mayank Gupta, who is assistant superintendent of police, Kharkhoda, Sonipat, will investigate the videos of the incident which were circulating on various social media platforms, while the other led by deputy superintendent of police, Sonipat, Virender Rao will carry out the overall probe into the incident. DSP Rao said all effort would be made to find out who all were involved in the crime besides the arrested four. Meanwhile, addressing media persons at the Singhu-Kundli border, Nihang Raja Raj Singh said that all four persons involved in Lakhbir’s murder had surrendered and that they would oppose any attempt by police to make more arrests in the case.

Jood, who has claimed that he was upholding honour of the Indian Tricolour, also faced criticism for his alleged involvement in a series of attacks on members of the Sikh community in Sydney. He was arrested on these charges in April and had pleaded guilty to three charges, including ‘assault’, ‘occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others’ and ‘armed with the intention to commit indictable offence’ after New South Wales department of public prosecutors as part of a plea bargain dropped eight charges that included racial hate crime. Australia’s minister for immigration, citizenship and multicultural affairs Alex Hawke, confirmed the removal of Jood, who was living in Australia on an expired student visa at the time of his arrest, in a series of tweets, saying: “Attempts to undermine Australia’s social cohesion will not be tolerated.” He also tweeted a link to the story on an Australian website that revealed that Jood had been put on the first flight to India just hours after his release from jail on parole. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia had lobbied hard with the Modi government to get Jood released and back home. Khattar had met external affairs minister S Jaishankar more than once to press for Jood’s case. Even, the members of the Ror community — to which Jood belongs — had also held protests in Karnal and Kurukshetra districts urging the government to ensure his release at the earliest. A roadshow was organised in Karnal in his honour, which concluded at the Ror Dharamshala here, after Jood reached Haryana on Sunday. Amid dhol beats, members of Jood’s family, community, and his friends welcomed him, honouring him with garlands of flowers. The family members and youths claimed that it is a proud movement that Vishal returned back after serving jail for “respect of the Tricolour” in Australia. Interacting with the media, Jood thanked the government as well as all communities who had supported him in this “struggle.” “Some people from the particular group were behind this incident and I could not tolerate the insult of Tricolour following which the entire episode happened. I was framed in false cases,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/karnal-welcomes-vishal-jood-who-was-deported-from-australia-after-jail-term/articleshow/87095108.cms||---

It is especially chaotic in the Calangute-Baga area. All Covid precautions were thrown to the wind with most visitors not wearing face masks or maintaining social distancing, while popular restaurants close to the beach were also packed to capacity. Public buses plying from Calangute to Panaji and Mapusa were also packed with all SOPs being ignored in the rush to carry the maximum passengers. Exuberant tourists thronging the beach also kept lifeguards on their toes by rushing into the sea despite red flag warnings of rough sea conditions. More than 50 people were saved from drowning at Calangute and Baga on Saturday and Sunday. With the new tourism season officially on from the beginning of this month and Covid cases reducing, domestic tourist footfalls are expected to grow by Diwali in two weeks. In view of the large number of tourists expected, the Calangute panchayat recently convened a meeting of the traffic and tourist police to ensure smooth traffic arrangements and to ensure there are no illegal activities or harassment of tourists on the beach. The panchayat said there will be zero tolerance to touts, beggars and hawkers on the beach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-candolim-buzzing-with-domestic-tourists/articleshow/87093811.cms||---

The farm outfit’s protest is being staged to demand a compensation of Rs 60,000 per acre for loss. The state government had on October 13 held a meeting with the protesters and offered a compensation of Rs 12,000 per acre as per state government policy, but the outfit rejected it. It said the loss was much more. “The pink bollworm has caused considerable loss to farmers in Bathinda and Mansa districts. It is being felt that the pest attack started due to spurious seeds, and spurious pesticides failed to contain the attack. The government must investigate the sale of spurious seeds and fertilisers as it had also happened in 2015, when farmers had to face a big loss due to whitefly attack on cotton crop due to spurious seeds and insecticides”, said BKU Ugrahan state secretary Shingara Singh Mann, who is leading the protest. He said the protest will continue till the government enhance the compensation amount, hinting that they may lower their demand from Rs 60,000 per acre if government was serious to negotiate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bku-ekta-ugrahan-protest-for-cotton-damage-relief-continues/articleshow/87095132.cms||---
---||Mumbai||First zero-Covid-death day in Mumbai since March 26, 2020||MUMBAI: After a period of 18 months and three weeks, Mumbai on Sunday registered zero Covid-19 deaths, last reported on March 26, 2020. Considering that the city, among the worst hotspots in the country during both Covid waves, registered three-digit deaths on some days, the zero-death figure is being seen as a milestone. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told TOI, “Mumbai will see zero deaths more often now.” His reply is based on extensive vaccination coverage in Mumbai: 97% of the city’s population has been covered with at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine and 55% are fully vaccinated. “We aim to reach the 100% target for the first dose in the next three to four days. I salute the BMC team and health workers for achieving this feat,” he said. Sunday’s ‘feat’ comes in the midst of a long weekend due to the Dussehra holiday on Friday; daily cases in both Mumbai and Maharashtra have been lower than usual. Maharashtra’s tally has been at a 17-month low for the last two days; it was 1,553 on Saturday and 1,715 on Sunday. Cities such as Delhi and Nagpur, too, have posted zero deaths. Read AlsoMore vaccine cocktail trials needed, says NTAGI chiefMixing and matching using two different Covid vaccines for immunization has a long way to go in the country, as experts here are determined to find the “best possible combination”.‘Sunday’s zero deaths not a sudden development’Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said, “It has been our aim to reach zero deaths in Mumbai.” While deaths were higher during the first wave when treatment protocols were being changed frequently, the second wave had lower deaths despite seeing more patients. Therefore BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani doesn’t see Sunday’s “zero deaths” as a sudden development. “Throughout the second wave, we had ensured with timely treatment that the case fatality rate remained below 1%,” he said. “Zero deaths” come amidst worry about rising cases in Mumbai after local train services and malls opened up in August: the city’s daily tally of 195 cases on August 16 has more than doubled to 558 cases on October 14. Chahal said the number of cases do not matter as long as the positivity rate is constant; the positivity rate of the city on Sunday was 1.2%. Read AlsoLong weekend: At 1,553, lowest Covid cases in Maharashtra in 17 monthsBlame it on the long weekend, but lower testing rates led to a sharp drop in daily cases in both the state as well as the city on Saturday.Full vaccination has not only cut down the risk of mortality, even a single dose helps reduce severity of the disease, city authorities say. “Nearly 96% of the newly infected cases do not need an ICU,” said Chahal. Even if the city sees 1,000 cases every day but reports zero deaths, the war is won. “It cannot be a pandemic if there are zero deaths,” he said, adding that with the BMC mandating fully vaccinated status for travelling in local trains and visiting malls, it has led to an increase in vaccination. “We are now taking vaccination to the doorstep of people. With complete vaccination allowing you to access services, vaccine hesitancy has evaporated,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra continued to report under 2,000 cases for the second day in a row and deaths were below 30 for the third consecutive day. The state reported 1,715 cases and 29 deaths on Sunday. Officials said that due to the long weekend, testing has dropped across the state. Health Minister Rajesh Tope said cases were on the decline in the state, but Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks should be followed.

Kandolkar had on Saturday said that it was essential to bring goddess “Durga” of West Bengal to Goa in order to slay the ‘Narkasur’ that, he said, the BJP government has come to embody. GFP has hinted that it would tie up with Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, but Kandolkar stopped short of naming Banerjee in his remarks. “We have goddess Shantadurga in Goa, but she is all peace. The real Durga, who is in West Bengal, needs to be brought to Goa to oust this Narkasur-like government,” Kandolkar had said. In a sharp riposte, the chief minister said that Goans will find this comparison of Shantadurga with a human being “unacceptable and contemptuous.” “Devi Shantadurga is the aradya daivat (principal deity) of Goa and is highly revered here. I feel Goans will not like Devi Shantadurga to be compared with anybody, much less with a human being in whose state atrocities are being committed on women. This is unacceptable, I feel Goans will never tolerate such type of things,” he said. Pointing out how violence was unleashed in West Bengal after TMC came to office following the recent state polls, Sawant said, “The entire country, Goans too, have seen that. If Devi Shantadurga is compared with anybody, Goans will treat it with disdain,” he said, advising GFP president Vijai Sardesai to rein in his party functionaries. Meanwhile, GFP vice president Durgadas Kamat took to Twitter to pick on Sawant’s statement. Kamat said in his tweet: “Mr @DrPramodPSawant, Your BJP MP calls @narendramodi ‘avatar’ of God. Your former Uttarakhand CM @TIRATHSRAWAT terms @narendramodi as ‘Ram’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kandolkar-compares-didi-with-durga-sawant-says-goans-wont-tolerate-it/articleshow/87093157.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

---||Goa||Transport dept’s digital push needs physical docus||Panaji: The transport department’s e-governance push, particularly the transport department’s Parivahan/Sarathi portal has drawn flak from netizens. While the Union ministry of road transport and highways and the RTO would have us believe that an online, hassle-free service exists, ground reality paints a different picture. Despite filling a form online, uploading the required documents and making an online payment, the transport department still requires applicants for basic services such as issue of a duplicate licence, change of address, issuance of registration certificates to stand in line and submit physical copies of the documents all over again. For Panaji-based IT professional Sangeeta Naik, the simple task of updating her address on her driving licence was so cumbersome that she took to social media to vent her ire. Despite submitting an online form, a copy of her address proof and making the payment online, Naik found herself standing in a long line at the transport department office in Panaji. After a long wait, she was shocked to hear the department officer tell her that she had to fill in a fresh application with the same details. “After I wrote the letter and gave it to him, I was redirected to wait in another queue called the inspection or inward queue. This queue was still longer,” said Naik. The transport department’s website itself states that online applications including submission of the form, uploading of documents, payment of fees and slot booking does not complete the process and that every applicant has to “compulsorily visit the RTO concerned” office to finish the process. “After waiting for 10 days to be on the safer side I sent a representative to check on my application as I really couldn’t afford to waste precious three to four hours standing in queue to get yet another dose of e-governance, the non e-way. He was told that my old licence had to be surrendered,” said Naik. Many netizens empathised with Naik’s experience and shared their experience with the online platform. While Amruta Shirodkar said that the “online process is an eyewash”, Bhaskar Prabhakar Rivoknar said “never follow the legal road, its very very long”. Naik’s experience caught the attention of Goa IT Professionals who promptly wrote to the transport minister Mauvin Godinho, secretary for transport Tariq Thomas and the transport department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/transport-depts-digital-push-needs-physical-docus/articleshow/87093340.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Goa||Many throw their hats in poll ring across Salcete||Colva: In the run-up to the 2022 assembly elections, various parties, and likely and unlikely candidates, have thrown their hats in the ring. While on the surface it may seem routine, but there are undercurrents. The entry of Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) has only served to further churn the political permutation and combination. President of the South Goa Advocates Association, Antonio Clovis D’Costa, who recently joined TMC in Kolkata, while expressing his anguish at BJP and Congress said that the later has time and again handed over its mandate to the former in seven states, including Goa. Asked if he was TMC candidate for Velim constituency, D’Costa said that while it was most likely, candidature was yet to be decided. There were apprehensions doing the rounds that sitting Velim MLA Filip Neri Rodrigues was also on the threshold of joining TMC and bagging the ticket, but that speculation seems to have been put to rest. TMC has also contacted several politicians including members of a regional party who are calling for unity of anti-BJP forces. Meanwhile, various I-PAC teams are carrying out aggressive on-ground surveys to pin-point probable contenders in various constituencies, and identify issues pertaining to the state as a whole and constituencies in particular. Fresh rumblings have also begun with new Congress entrant Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco putting up the party’s banners with his photos in Benaulim constituency and also calling for a block committee meeting.

---||Kolkata||Iskcon Kolkata devotees gather outside Bangladesh mission||KOLKATA: Five-hundred-odd monks, brahmacharis and devotees of Iskcon gathered outside the Bangladesh deputy high commission here on Sunday, holding candles and singing bhajans and kirtans, in peaceful protest against the violence perpetrated on their temple premises in Noakhali, Bangladesh. Ashram devotee Partha Das was killed when the temple was attacked on Friday afternoon. The temple was burnt and broken in parts and statues were vandalised, according to an official communique released by Iskcon Kolkata. “Iskcon is a living example of harmony where so many global communities amalgamate to celebrate each other’s festivals,” said Subekshana Das, co-director of Iskcon Mayapur. Spokesperson Subrata Das said from Mayapur: “An attack on Iskcon is an attack on the fabric of humanity.” A Shanti Yajna was organised to restore peace. An official protest will be held on Monday in Mayapur. The spiritual order has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to connect with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina so that the attacks on temples, which have been on for the past nine days, can be brought under control. Iskcon has also written to the UN to step in and send a delegation. “Did the minorities of Bangladesh, who suffered the deadly Noakhali riots of 1946 and the massacre of 1971, stay back to see this day?” said the letter written by Iskcon Kolkata vice-president Radharaman Das to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres. The letter describes how a mob of 200 entered the temple premises and vandalised it, killing the 25-year-old devotee, whose body was later found in an adjacent pond. Iskcon is organising worldwide protests outside diplomatic missions of Bangladesh in every country, an official communique said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iskcon-devotees-gather-outside-bdesh-mission/articleshow/87094231.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||BJP brings up B’desh as TMC gears up to wrest Santipur||Santipur: The vandalism of Durga Puja pandals in Bangladesh crept into poll-bound Bengal on Sunday, with opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari saying it would have an “impact” while campaigning in Santipur, and Trinamool Congress reminding him that “Santipur is in India, not Bangladesh”. Of the four assembly segments that go to polls on October 30, Santipur poses the stiffest challenge for Trinamool. TMC candidate Ajoy De had lost to BJP’s Jagannath Sarkar by 15,878 votes just six months ago. This time, in place of six-time MLA De, Trinamool has fielded Brajakishore Goswami against BJP veteran Niranjan Biswas. Adhikari, who held consecutive organisational meetings at Santipur, said: “Sarkar had a lead of 16,000 votes. Recent incidents in Bangladesh will have an impact and BJP will increase the margin by three-fold. People who migrated from Bangladesh will give a befitting reply to the events in the neighbouring country.” Santipur is around 45km from the Indo-Bangladesh border outpost and has a sizeable migrant population. A senior Trinamool leader said: “Santipur is in India and not Bangladesh. People here will not vote based on what happens in a different country.” TMC MP Mahua Moitra, who was camping in the constituency, was confident of a win. “There is no doubt about it,” she said. TMC state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh questioned PM Narendra Modi’s silence on the issue. “The Centre should play an effective role, and BJP mustn’t do cheap drama of fake Hindutva over it. We want safety of minorities in both India and Bangladesh,” he said. Home to Advaita Acharya, a companion of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Santipur has a strong presence of Vaishnavites. Advaita Acharya was also a guru to Haridasa Thakur, one of the pioneers of the Hare Krishna movement. The Vaishnavites in the area, once close to Congress, started shifting their allegiance to BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In 2016, BJP’s Sufal Sarkar got a little more than 8,000 votes. Over the next five years, there was a reversal of fortune and Jagannath Sarkar managed to get more than 1,09,000 votes. Congress votes came down from 1,03,566 in 2016 to 9,848 in 2021. Santipur also has a large population from the Matua community. While Babla panchayat is largely dominated by followers of Advaita Acharya, there are a few tribal villages where RSS has a strong presence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-brings-up-bdesh-as-tmc-gears-up-to-wrest-santipur/articleshow/87094387.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Kolkata||Muslims in West Bengal condemn violence in Bangladesh||KOLKATA: Muslims in West Bengal, including civil society and religious figures and youths, have strongly condemned the violence in Bangladesh during Durga Puja last week that resulted in the deaths of at least four persons. Some have taken to social media to express solidarity with the victims of violence while others have issued public statements urging the Bangladesh government to make all arrangements for the safety of minorities and to bring the perpetrators to book. Bengal Imams’ Association issued a statement condemning the “unIslamic” incident and called for the safety of minorities in Bangladesh. “The minorities should have been celebrating Durga Puja but instead they are living in fear. How can the act of a person be held against an entire community and hounded like this? As minorities in India, we understand what our Hindu brothers and sisters are going through and their concern for their safety and those of their near and dear ones. Thousands of Durga Pujas are organised in Bangladesh every year, but such an incident has never been heard of,” said association chairman Mohammad Yahya. Businessman and social activist Mohammad Tauseef Rahman, who along with other residents was instrumental in reviving a Durga Puja in predominantly Muslim Alimuddin Street this year after nine years, is shocked at the events in Bangladesh. “I frequently travel to Bangladesh and have noticed that minorities have carved a niche in every sphere of society there. The news of vandalism and subsequent violence have come as a total shock. I condemn the incident,” he said. “The government there should probe if anybody is trying to disturb peace in this region by creating such rifts,” he added. Teacher and political analyst Hasnain Imam said hate crimes should be strongly condemned, irrespective of where they took place and against whom. “In South Asian region, the position of all minorities is increasingly becoming vulnerable. So it is very important that hate crimes be condemned in the strongest way possible,” he said. Several young Muslims too took to social media to protest against the incident. “Nobody must be targeted for their faiths and beliefs. It is the responsibility of the Muslims in Bangladesh to protect their minorities,” said college student Ayesha Fateh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/muslims-condemn-violence-in-bdesh/articleshow/87094179.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||B’desh violence: Bengal vigil against social media misuse||Kolkata/Durgapur/Egra: The West Bengal government has asked agencies to remain alert against misuse of social media images of vandalism of Durga Puja pandals in Bangladesh to foment tension during ongoing Puja immersions in the state till Monday, and Fateha-Dwaz-Daham on Monday and Tuesday. On Sunday, Bengal police took to social media to warn of legal action against those users who were trying to misrepresent isolated immersion-related brawls over liquor and alleged theft by minors in Durgapur and East Midnapore’s Egra respectively. The state intelligence branch alert says that centring around developments in Bangladesh, certain fundamentalist groups were becoming active in sensitive border zones and issuing public statements demanding that India step in to stop religious persecution in Bangladesh. The alert also highlights the ongoing back-to-back festivals in Bengal and advises “sharp vigil to thwart any untoward incident”. On Saturday evening, a clash broke out between two groups during immersions in Durgapur’s Annapurna Nagar. The trigger was some youths’ persistent demands for money to buy liquor while returning home. Six persons were injured and several vehicles ransacked. An FIR was lodged against four persons, two of whom were detained for questioning. “Some people are spreading wrong information that bombs were hurled at Puja pandals and damage was done, giving communal colour and trying to disturb peace in the area. Strong legal action will be taken for spreading such wrong and misleading information,” both Asansol police and Bengal police said in a statement on Twitter. ADG (law and order) Jawed Shamim said those found propagating fake news would face legal action. In Egra, an alleged theft by minors was being given a communal overtone in some social media posts, police said. Organisers had emptied out of a Puja pandal near Egra Central bus stand due to rain when a few minors playing there accidentally removed a few items from the Durga idol, police added. They said the incident was caught on CCTV. Organisers didn’t lodge any complaint. SP (East Midnapore) Amarnath K said: “There are attempts to communalise this incident. Strict legal action will be taken against those who spread fake news.” Police officers said they were being extra vigilant due to the bypolls on October 30.

---||Kochi||530grams of cocaine seized at Kochi airport, 2 Nigerian women held||KOCHI: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths in Kochi seized 530 grams of cocaine and arrested two women hailing from Nigeria in connection with the seizure. The value of the seized cocaine is estimated to be around Rs 5.5 crore in the international market. The carrier, Kane Simpou Julie (21), had arrived at the Cochin International Airport Limited (Cial) on Saturday from Lagos via Doha. Although she possessed a Côte d'Ivoire passport, sources said that she was a resident of Nigeria. Julie arrived on a Qatar Airways flight. The contraband was concealed in the false bottom of her trolley bag. Sleuths approached her based on specific intelligence and made the seizure. Sleuths then found out from the carrier about the second accused, another Nigerian woman, Ifoema Queen Anozie (33), who has been staying in India for the past four years. She was based out of Mumbai and used to coordinate with the carrier about the contraband supply and the carrier's travel. Sources said that the DRI sleuths kept the information about the seizure quiet so as to make the woman think that the consignment got through the airport safely. She had come to Kochi via train from Mumbai and had got off the train at the South station. Later on, sleuths contacted the woman through texts and made her come to a hotel on the pretext of meeting the carrier. DRI officials recorded her arrest when she came for the meet-up. They recorded the arrest of both accused on Sunday and produced them before a magistrate. The duo have been remanded in 14 days of judicial custody. Earlier, the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) Kochi team had foiled an attempt to send 3.5kg of hashish oil to Bahrain from Kochi and seized the contraband from a courier consignment on September 12. NCB had also seized 1.6kg of Pseudoephedrine from a courier consignment at Ernakulam on September 22, which was destined for Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/530g-of-cocaine-seized-at-kochi-airport-2-nigerian-women-held/articleshow/87096901.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cotton prices hit new high, soften pink bollworm blow||Bathinda: The pink bollworm pest has adversely affected yield of the cotton crop in Bathinda and Mansa districts of Punjab, but there is a silver lining at the end of the tunnel — the crop is being sold for a premium in grain markets, with the selling price touching an all-time high of Rs 8,060 per quintal at one place on Saturday. Previously, the cotton crop had touched an all-time high of Rs 7,000 per quintal. Usually, the crop does not sell for more than Rs 6,000 per quintal. Though a considerable portion of cotton has been damaged by pink bollworm in Bathinda and Mansa this year, farmers are still bringing the cotton that could be salvaged from their fields to grain markets. At Bhucho Mandi in Bathinda district, the crop traded at Rs 8,060 per quintal. In Bathinda, it fetched Rs 8,015 per quintal. In Abohar mandi, it fetched a price of Rs 7,840 per quintal as highest. Less quality cotton also was traded between Rs 6,000 and Rs 6,500 per quintal, while the MSP for 27.5-28.5mm-long staple cotton was Rs 5,925 per quintal. Cotton has been sown on 3.03 lakh hectares in Punjab this year. Farmer Iqbal Singh from Bhagi Wander village near Talwandi Sabo, who had sown cotton in his family-owned 17 acres, said he got a yield of less than four quintal per acre, which was 9-10 quintals per acre earlier. "Had the yield been similar, we could have made a fortune. Now we are in a dilemma: whether to call it white gold or not," he said. Fellow villager Mohinder Singh, who had sown the crop on three acres, too complained of low yield due to pink bollworm. A number of pests were seen crawling on the ground where Mohinder and Iqbal had unloaded the cotton crop in the grain market. Mohinder said, "We had taken three acres on lease for Rs 59,000 per acre and will have to incur loss, as we may not be able to get any profit from this crop and will have to depend on the next wheat crop." A few metres away, Malkit Singh of Buladewala village, who had sown crop on 1.5 acres said the yield was low. Accompanying him, small farmer Mithu Singh from Bir Talaab village, who had sown cotton on only one acre, said he got less than four quintals, which ideally should have been over 10 quintals. However, farmer Gursahib Singh was pleased as his cotton crop fetched Rs 7,920 per quintal. He got a yield of over 10 quintals per acre. He said it was first picking and one more or even two pickings will be done. "I expect to get better price for the crop," he said. Bathinda market committee secretary Gurwinder Singh said adequate quantity of cotton was coming to mandis and fetching prices close to Rs 8,000 per quintal. BOX 4.5L quintals bought According to the data compiled by the Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board, the 4.47 lakh quintals of cotton crop has been purchased by private traders till October 16. Of this, 1.61 lakh quintals has been sold in mandis of Fazilka, 93,000 quintals in Mansa, 90,500 quintal in Muktsar and 90,850 quintal in mandis of Bathinda. Apart from these, over 11,000 quintals of cotton has been sold in mandis of Faridkot, Barnala and Sangrur. Reasons behind price surge Cotton trading agency Indian Cotton Association Limited (IACL) former president Mahesh Sharda said cited delayed arrival of crop due to inclement weather, a fall of 5% in area under cotton and a speculative swing the international market as probable reasons for spurt in prices. "Though it is expected prices may come down to some extent after Diwali when arrival will pick up, prices would firm up in the long run," he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cotton-prices-hit-new-high-soften-pink-bollworm-blow/articleshow/87095069.cms||Neel Kamal

Speaking at the India-Israel Business Roundtable soon after his arrival in Israel on his maiden visit, Jaishankar said there is an enormous effort of change happening in India since PM Narendra Modi took office and people have heard bits and pieces of that change. “If you were to connect all those dots, I think, you get a picture of an India that is moving towards acquiring those deeper strengths which will make it more competitive in terms of the world economy,” he told the gathering. While this change has been going on for a few years and during the last two years of the Covid-19 pandemic when people have not been in touch physically, interestingly the change process has accelerated, he said. “So, I would urge anyone who has any interest in defence to either directly or indirectly in terms of a platform or in terms of an ancillary or as a vendor to look at those possibilities”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaishankar-invites-israeli-businesses-to-invest-in-india/articleshow/87096942.cms||---

By her own admission, she considers this cosmopolitan seaside enclave with its rich Portuguese-Dutch heritage, home away from home and when Covid-19 restrictions prevented her from travelling to Kerala, she decided to do her bit for the place, even if it was remotely. Over the last five months, she has helped gift grocery and personal hygiene kits -- sanitisers, masks etc -- worth Rs 1,000 each to nearly 450 families in and around Fort Kochi. Giusy Panico (L) with friend Sreekumar, who distributed the kits on her behalf, during her visit to Kochi in 2019The last batch of kits was distributed to workers of Dhoby Khana public laundry on Sunday. “Kochi has always made me feel at home, the people are very welcoming. The tourism industry in Kerala, it's mainstay, is struggling to get back on its feet. Hundreds of people are struggling to survive, so I felt like taking a tangible initiative to help the local people,” Giusy, who works in the private sector, told TOI. Eager to visit Kochi again, says GiusyGiusy decided to raise money and personally approached her family and friends in Europe. Giusy asked her friend V K Sreekumar, who runs a homestay in Fort Kochi, how she could help the locals here and eventually they hit on the practical idea of providing basic kits. Around 50 people in Europe, mostly Guisy’s friends and family members, contributed to the effort. The money was transferred to Sreekumar who arranged everything in Fort Kochi. “As I work in the tourism industry, it was easy to identify deserving people. We prepared the kit containing around 20 items like all essential groceries, hand sanitizers, soaps, masks etc. We started the campaign in May and delivered the kits to many with the help of the tourist guides' association. A few kits were given to those working in backwater tourism in Kumbalangi and Vaikom,” said Sreekumar. Giusy is determined to try and take forward the campaign with the help of more friends. “I am eager to visit Kochi again once the travel restriction ease,” she said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/from-naples-with-love-fort-kochis-italian-connection/articleshow/87096935.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Chandigarh||HAU develops electric tractor with low-running cost||Hisar: The College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology (COAE&T) of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University (CCSHAU), Hisar, has developed an electric tractor. It has become the first agricultural university in the country to conduct research on electric tractors. The tractor is powered by a 16.2-kilowatt battery, and its running cost is very less as compared to diesel tractor. HAU vice-chancellor Professor B R Kamboj said this e-tractor can run at a top speed of 23.17 km per hour and travels up to 80 km with trailer weighing 1.5 tonnes. The use of this e-tractor will help farmers to increase their income, the VC said. This research has been accomplished by MTech student Venkatesh Shinde under the guidance of Mukesh Jain, scientist, department of farm machinery and power engineering, COAE&T and director, Northern Region Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Hisar. “There are about 80 lakh tractors in India of which about 4 lakh tractors are in the state of Haryana. The annual pollution due to carbon dioxide production by tractors below 30 hp is 46 lakh tonne in India and 2.3 lakh tonne in Haryana. If we replace diesel tractors with battery-operated tractors, then this amount of pollution can be reduced,” the VC said. He said average farm power availability in India is 2.0 kWh per hectare, while in developed countries it is around 15 kWh per hectare. Due to the huge gap, there is a lot of scope for mechanization, and hence, development of battery-operated tractor will not only help in decreasing pollution level, but in increasing the level of mechanization, Kamboj said. Further, the hourly cost of operating a battery-operated tractor with rotavator and mould board plough is Rs 332 and Rs 301, respectively, instead of Rs 447 and Rs 353 with diesel tractor. The cost of operating an electric tractor is 15 to 25% (Rs/h) cheaper than that of a diesel tractor. These costs have been calculated based on the domestic electricity rate, otherwise the cost of operation will be even lower, he said. “Being a prototype model, the battery-operated tractor costs around Rs 6.5 lakh while a diesel tractor with the same HP costs Rs 4.50 lakh. If the battery-operated tractor is manufactured on a large scale, then its price will come at par with the diesel tractor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hau-develops-electric-tractor-with-low-running-cost/articleshow/87095128.cms||---

The meeting held in Chandigarh included All-India Congress Committee (AICC) observer Harish Chaudhary along with AICC joint secretary Krishna Allavaru. Punjab minister and PPCC general secretary Pargat Singh was present too. Sidhu had recently resigned from the post of state party president over the CM's decision to appoint advocate general (AG) and director-general of police (DGP) without consulting him. A day after Sidhu’s resignation, Channi had reached out to him and offered to resolve issues through talks, and later they had decided later to set up a partygovernment coordination committee. Sidhu took back his resignation after meeting Harish Rawat and KC Venugopal on October 14 and then Rahul Gandhi on October 15 on the assurance that all his concerns would be addressed. According to sources, Congress high command is in constant touch with the state leadership and closely monitoring the situation. The government has been at the receiving end of the opposition parties for its failure to keep the major poll promises and ongoing tussle within the Congress party. The meeting assumes significance as Sidhu on October 15, after meeting Rahul, had written to party president Sonia Gandhi urging her to direct the state government to act in the best interest of the people of Punjab immediately. In the letter, which Sidhu made public on Sunday by tweeting it, Sidhu highlighted all the key issues which he has been raising for the betterment of Punjab. During the meeting, Sidhu pressed upon the chief minister to ensure speedy justice in the sacrilege cases by punishing culprits behind the crime. 18-point agenda, then 5-point priority agenda, and now 13 in 3.5 monthsIt was originally an 18-point agenda given by the party high command to then Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in the last week of June with a timeline for implementation. Around a month later, Navjot Sidhu handed over five priority points to Amarinder.  However, the peace formula did not work. Sidhu has now given 13 points culled from the 18-point agenda for quick and effective implementation. It is set to become a tall order for CM Charanjit Singh Channi to work on this agenda which includes contentious issues too. ‘Always strive to follow the values of our party to empower the poorest of poor’A four-member team, headed by Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, commissioner of Ludhiana range, has been formed to arrest the culprits involved in sacrilege cases with direction from the chief minister to deliver results at the earliest. The day-to-day functioning of the team will be personally monitored by DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota. Sidhu raised the issues which he had highlighted in his letter to Sonia at the meeting. In the letter, Sidhu had sought time from her to present a ‘Punjab Model’ with 13-point agenda to be part of the Congress manifesto for 2022 assembly polls. “I express with a lot of pain in my heart that this is Punjab’s last chance for resurrection and redemption,” he wrote in the letter. The points highlighted by Sidhu, include justice in sacrilege cases, drug menace, agricultural issues, cheap electricity, cancellation of the faulty power purchase agreements, the welfare of Scheduled Caste and Backward Caste people, employment, single window system & comparative advantage, women & youth empowerment, liquor trade, sand mining, transport and cable mafia. While terming it as the last damage control exercise, Sidhu warned that “mafia-raj ruling the state patronised by the Badals will take the state to the extent of financial emergency, joblessness, corruption and agrarian crisis from which there will be no return.” Requesting Sonia to consider the points highlighted by him, Sidhu urged the party president to direct the state government to act in the best interest of the people of Punjab immediately. “I always strive to follow the values of our party to empower the poorest of the poor, to give opportunities to the last man in the queue, but these been hard solutions and one of the main reasons for dislike against me by powerful people associated with mafia ruining the state,” he wrote in the letter. Highlighting the financial woes of the state, Sidhu stated that Punjab for decades was the richest state of the country and has now become the most indebted state. He held financial mismanagement over the last 25 years and diversion of public resources responsible for making a few “powerful people” rich and leaving the state debt distressed. He also accused the BJP-led central government of discrimination against Punjab while paying its financial dues such as GST payments, rural development fund and post-matric scholarship and said that financial problems of Punjab have supplemented during seven years of BJP rule. He added that due to the state not having enough resources, government hiring is at the lowest wages and contractual. “Every year government has to take new debt to support basic development works, to invest in 60:40 shared central government schemes, providing healthcare, education, and infrastructure needs of the state,” he rued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/navjot-singh-sidhu-punjab-cm-charanjit-singh-channi-meet-agree-to-set-up-panel-on-sacrilege/articleshow/87097008.cms||---

They sing their prayers, do yoga exercises, complete their study periods before logging off at 5 pm. Despite getting Permanent Residency (PR) status this year, the duo continue their studies online in an Ahmedabad school. Their father, Paresh Bharatiya, an aero engineering specialist, explained that till the local school offers online education, he and his wife have decided not to take admission for the kids in an Australian school. “Standard of education in primary and secondary schools is higher in India,” said Bharatiya, justifying his decision. Bharatiya’s wife and kids had gone to Australia on tourist visa early last year. Days after their arrival, Covid-19 lockdown was imposed and Australia suspended all direct flights from India. In the interim, Bharatiya applied for PR for his family under a special category which was granted this year resulting in the family now permanently settled in Australia. The pandemic witnessed many Indian students enrolled in foreign universities completing degrees from home in India. Inversely, many school children with families living abroad are managing time zone differences and logging into city schools from home in Australia, Sweden, Africa, UK, Dubai, US to name a few countries. Dubai-based sisters Disha (14) and Mahi (9) are studying in Zebar International School for Children. Father Gopal Sachanandani told TOI he is settled in Dubai since 1996 and planned to relocate to India. “We took school admission for the girls on March 20 last year and days later lockdown happened. Once flights opened up, we decided to stay in Dubai till the pandemic settles as health infrastructure here is better. But as Indian schooling is good, we continued with online education,” said Gopal Sachanandani. ‘Conflicting time zones are the biggest challenge’ | page 4 Gopal Sachanandani said that Dubai has already vaccinated 12 years-plus children. “Once my younger daughter gets the vaccine, we plan to shift to India when Covid settles,” he added. He said the girls have to log into school at 6.30 am but they do not mind it much. They send exam papers and assignments through courier. School also gives them extra classes. School authorities say that there are many children who are studying online from various countries post Covid-19. "Some children were travelling to be with their parents when Covid travel restrictions grounded them," said Manan Choksi, trustee of Udgam School. SGVP International School principal Padma Kumar said that seven students from her school are studying online from abroad. "Majority students are from African countries and Dubai. The students do not face much problem as the time difference is only two and half hours. We are hopeful that most of these students will return to campus by December," she said. Sharmistha Sinha, principal, Zebar School said they have five students studying from abroad. “Conflicting time zones is the biggest challenge faced by these students while submission of examination answer scripts becomes difficult and time-consuming. But we extend all possible cooperation,” said Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/studying-in-abad-from-oz-dubai-uk/articleshow/87095818.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Every road you take, we’ll be joltin’ you||AHMEDABAD: Each day the municipal corporation of the city releases a list of roads that have been resurfaced. But how smooth or less bone rattling is your ride to office or home? In the last few days the ‘roughness index’ — cumulative deformations of a road stretch — of a few of the important city roads was determined using a special mobile app used recently by municipal officials of Mumbai, Greater Hyderabad and even the MP road development corporation(MPRDC). It turns out that 22% to 37% of the four road stretches that TOI tested were either average or had poor ride quality. These roads included Judges Bungalow to APMC Junction, Aithithi Crossroads to Gujarat University, Navrangpura to APMC Crossroads and Gujarat University to Navrangpura Junction. Times ViewSafe, motorable and reliable roads for commuting is the right of every citizen. It is time the AMC commits to building high quality, long-lasting public roads. To ensure this, parameters like the road roughness index should become a standard for auditing road quality in city. Greater Hyderabad and Greater Mumbai municipal corporations and states like MP have already adopted the criterion. Ahmedabad too should move in that direction.The app Road Bounce detects vibrations and calculates the roughness index of a road depending whether they are concrete or asphalt. A concrete road must have fewer than 2,200 vertical elevations, that is, small or large bumps, in a 100-meter section to be classed as 'excellent' under the roughness index. An asphalt road must have 2,000. Similarly, an asphalt road is classified as 'average' if it has between 2,000 and 3,000 vertical rises in a 100-meter stretch. The route is classified as 'bad' if this number surpasses 3,000 bumps. Keeping that in mind, the 5.7km stretch between Atithi Crossroads and Gujarat University, has a 63% road stretch that is good, while 34% has average ride quality while a 3% stretch is detected as “poor”. Similarly, the ride between Gujarat University and Navrangpura railway crossing has 13% of the road stretch with poor quality, while in case of the stretch between Judges Bungalow and APMC Junction it is 11%. “Most of the roads in the city are resurfaced and even repaired as per IRC standards and those laid by the Gujarat roads and building department. A lot of the roads had undergone patchwork. Especially in the west zone because of which there may be a few deformations. But the overall ride quality is as per standards,” said a senior AMC road and bridges department official. He also added that the app-based roughness index measurement usually does not distinguish between speed bumps or manholes with undulations on roads as part of roughness index. Sudhir Khatri, 27, a restaurant owner in Prahladnagar says, “I usually take the Shivranjaini to Shreyas Crossing route to drop my daughter for her martial art classes. I find that the road had been dug recently and then patched haphazardly after the rains. Even my SUV’s suspensions gets rattled while driving on that stretch.” Kavi Sachdeva, 13, a school student from Vejalpur says, “I ride my bicycle for my tuition classes and I find the internal roads in residential areas to be poorly maintained. I sometimes get mild backaches after riding for 10 minutes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/every-road-you-take-well-be-joltin-you/articleshow/87091315.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The police came from Nalgonda district. They opened fire after the group hurled stones at them. Two ganja smugglers were injured and shifted to the government hospital in Narsipatnam for treatment. Nalgonda Task Force police recently seized over 300 kilos of dry ganja. Their investigation revealed that one Balakrishna, along with some others from Lammasingi, were supplying the contraband in Nalgonda. The police came to Lammasingi in connection with the case to nab smugglers. On Friday they nabbed one K Bhima Raju of Annavaram. Their efforts to apprehend Balakrishna, however, proved futile. Family members and acquaintances of Bhima Raju, who were searching for him later came to know that he had been arrested by the police. On Sunday, Nalgonda police decided to hand over Bhima Raju to his family. While they were heading towards Annavaram, a number of villagers, including some ganja smugglers, lay in wait for the police. Suspecting that locals would attack them, the police tried to turn back but their vehicles got stuck near Lammasingi due to traffic on the ghat road. Angry villagers, including some ganja smugglers, hurled stones at the police. Some personnel suffered injuries in the skirmish, which also damaged their vehicles. Nalgonda police then opened fire in the air in self-defence. However, two persons — Kamaraju and Rambabu — suffered bullet injuries. DIG (Visakha Range) L K V Ranga Rao and Vizag Rural police chief B Krishna Rao confirmed reports of firing. The injured persons were shifted to a hospital where their condition is said to be stable, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-police-open-fire-at-ganja-smugglers-in-andhra-pradesh-two-injured/articleshow/87097118.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Gurgaon||Youth who had helped friend in trouble lynched by 6 in Haryana's Mahendergarh||MALDA (MAHENDERGARH): “They are beating me, I will die.” The words haunt anganwadi worker Sweety. They were from her son, 18-year-old Gaurav Yadav, who was allegedly lynched by six men in Malda village of Mahendergarh district on October 9. “It was the last time I heard his voice,” the 36-year-old told TOI. A video of the incident that emerged on October 13 shows the men showering blows on the boy with sticks even as he begged for mercy. Last week, an FIR was registered at Kanina police station against six persons -- Ravi alias Langra, Kaptan, Pritam, Sukhdev, Ajay alias Bhandari, and Fukra – on charges of murder and rioting among others, police said. So far, one of the men, Fukra, has been arrested in the case that triggered a shock wave in Biwani village where the victim hailed from. A first in the family of farmers to complete class 12 with distinction marks, Gaurav wanted to join a college even as he was preparing to join the Indian Air Force. On October 9, Sweety said her son had gone to submit documents for admission to a college. “I had just called him around 1.15 pm to ask after him, but as soon as he picked up the phone, he blurted out that Langra and accomplices were beating him up and that he would die. I panicked and told my husband to rush to the location,” Sweety said.  The men reeked of alcohol, said Gaurav’s grandfather Krishan Kumar, who had accompanied his son Devinder to rescue the 18-year-old. “They were brutally hitting him. When we managed to free him from their clutches and tried to take him to a hospital, it seemed that his spinal cord had twisted. There was a deep dent,” the 60-year-old said.  Gaurav kept asking for some medication to ease the pain, the family added. “Eventually, his body turned blue and he succumbed on the way to the hospital,” Krishan said. The family alleged that Gaurav had fractured legs, arms and backbone in the incident. The police, meanwhile, said that the accused did not hit Gaurav on the head. Instead, they kept hitting him with sticks all over his body, leaving him with “multiple injuries”. “This is a murder that was committed with an intention to create fear among the villagers. There was a quarrel earlier but it was not any big issue and happens every day among boys. We are investigating the matter,” Santosh Kumar, station house officer of Kanina, said. The accused, police said, had criminal antecedents. They have been booked under IPC Sections 302 (murder), 148 (rioting with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 34 (common intention), the SHO said. According to Devinder, on September 1 Gaurav had gone to a nearby temple after his friend had sought his help following a quarrel with the accused. “My son just helped his friend and came back home. Since then, he had been receiving abusive calls from these men. We never thought this would take such an ugly turn,” he added. A hapless Sweety says the family had pinned their hope around Gaurav. “I worked hard for 18 years so that he could get an education and do something in his life but I lost to some men who wanted to show their power to a young boy. I don’t know what they achieve out of this,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/youth-who-had-helped-friend-in-trouble-lynched-by-6/articleshow/87092884.cms||Sagrika Kissu

---||India||India’s first woman lawmaker had to make her mark in a sea of men||In January 1930, the Madras Legislative Council was discussing a law on prostitution. A fundamental point of contention was how the law should define a prostitute. The definition before the council was: “Prostitute means a woman who offers her body for indiscriminate sexual intercourse for hire.” Some members did not agree with the different standards of morality and the onus of prostitution being cast only on women. They rallied around an amendment that defined a prostitute as a person of either sex. Dr S Muthulakshmi Reddi, the first woman lawmaker in the country, and the only woman among the more than 100 members of the council, proposed this definition. The Government of India Act of 1919 had made it possible for women to vote in an election. This law gave legislative councils in the provinces the option to decide the qualification of voters in an election. In 1921, Madras Legislative Council passed a resolution giving some women the power to vote. Then, another resolution a few years later paved the way for women to become lawmakers. In 1926, the government nominated 40-year-old Dr Reddi to the legislative council. In her maiden speech to congratulate the council president on his election, she said, “I am the only lady member in this assembly even though one half of the population are women. You know, sir, that our position in society is still backward and we have many grievances, one of which is that only two women out of every hundred are able to read and write. So you will side with me in all my attempts to ameliorate their condition realising that no country or nation will prosper without the active support and cooperation of women.” Her colleagues elected her as the deputy president to chair the council’s proceedings in the absence of the president. PT Rajan, the grandfather of the current finance minister of Tamil Nadu, moved the motion for her election. Felicitating her, a council member remarked that she might be the first woman in the world to be presiding over a legislature. Dr Reddi came from a humble background and overcame personal hardship to complete her degree in medicine. She used her insights as a working doctor to highlight public health issues, their financing and infrastructure. Dr Reddi also focused her legislative interventions on the protection of women. She worked extensively to abolish the Devadasi system. Her efforts led to the strengthening of the Madras Immoral Traffic Act. The legislative council dropped the reference to women in the definition of prostitution. She was also able to increase the age at which girls could be rescued from brothels. Over the years, the trend of women’s representation in our legislatures has not been encouraging. The percentage of women in Lok Sabha has never exceeded 15% of the directly elected house. The situation in state legislative assemblies is no better. After the first general elections in 1952, Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru wrote to the chief ministers of states about the low number of women elected to legislatures. In his letter, he said, “I am quite sure that our real and basic growth will only come when women have a full chance to play their part in public life. Wherever they have had this chance, they have, as a whole, done well, better if I may say so, than the average man. Our laws are man-made, our society dominated by man, and so most of us naturally take a very lopsided view of the matter. We cannot be objective, because we have grown up in certain grooves of thought and action. But the future of India will probably depend ultimately more upon the women than the men.” Last month was the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the women’s reservation bill in Parliament. Dr Reddi championed the cause of reservation for women in elected bodies. In a debate in the Madras legislative council, she said, “We want reservation not because men would be opposed to our interests, but because women’s point of view should be represented by women.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-first-woman-lawmaker-had-to-make-her-mark-in-a-sea-of-men/articleshow/87097143.cms||Chakshu Roy
---||Gurgaon||Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurates 71 'Har Hith' stores across Haryana to boost jobs||GURUGRAM: Aimed at encouraging self-employment among the youths, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday inaugurated 71 Har Hith stores across 21 districts, barring Sirsa. While Khattar was in the city to inaugurate one of the stores in Gurugram, other 70 stores were inaugurated virtually via video conferencing organised at Rosy Pelican Tourist Complex in Gurugram. On Sunday, CM launched the ambitious scheme — the ‘Har Hith store’ scheme — promoting self-employment among the people by inaugurating one of the 71 stores at Farrukhnagar. While inaugurating the store, Khattar called upon the youth to look for various self-employment avenues and committed state government’s assistance in creating a conducive environment for the same. “These stores are being opened with an objective of ensuring that good domestic products of daily needs are available to everyone, from villages to cities, at affordable prices. The aim is to generate new employment avenues to address the issue of unemployment. Haryana government has set a target of providing employment to at least one person in every family of the state by 2025,” the CM said. As per the policy that proposes to address the issue of unemployment, the government will open 1,500 such stores in rural areas and around 500 in urban areas in a phased manner. “It is our plan to open such stores at least one each in municipal ward in villages serving population of over 3,000 people. In cities, it will be opened for a group of wards with a population of around 10,000. All the government departments will coordinate and cooperate in allotting land for the franchise of this chain of grocery stores across the state. We hope that in future these stores would establish their own brand value like big companies,” said Haryana agriculture minister Jaiprakash Dalal. Apart from MSMEs, small industrial units, and cooperative sector units, quality products prepared by the Self Help Group of women will be available at these stores at a lower price than the market retail price. All the goods will be sold through computerised system. To encourage people, especially from the financially weaker background, the government has claimed that it has drafted a dedicated franchise policy. Under that policy, people in the age group of 18-35 years can apply. These stores, government claims, will ensure a minimum monthly earning of Rs 15,000 based on the sales made. “Priority will be given to women and youths belonging to the families that have Parivar Pehcan Patra and have an annual income of Rs 1.8 lakh or less. Each store will help the youth to earn at least Rs 15,000 per month. In case that doesn’t happen, the government will pay the difference amount,” said an HAICL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cm-inaugurates-71-har-hith-stores-across-state-to-promote-employment/articleshow/87093023.cms||---

While inaugurating the store, Khattar called upon the youth to look for various self-employment avenues and committed state government’s assistance in creating a conducive environment for the same. “These stores are being opened with an objective of ensuring that good domestic products of daily needs are available to everyone, from villages to cities, at affordable prices. The aim is to generate new employment avenues to address the issue of unemployment. Haryana government has set a target of providing employment to at least one person in every family of the state by 2025,” the CM said. As per the policy that proposes to address the issue of unemployment, the government will open 1,500 such stores in rural areas and around 500 in urban areas in a phased manner. “It is our plan to open such stores at least one each in municipal ward in villages serving population of over 3,000 people. In cities, it will be opened for a group of wards with a population of around 10,000. All the government departments will coordinate and cooperate in allotting land for the franchise of this chain of grocery stores across the state. We hope that in future these stores would establish their own brand value like big companies,” said Haryana agriculture minister Jaiprakash Dalal. Apart from MSMEs, small industrial units, and cooperative sector units, quality products prepared by the Self Help Group of women will be available at these stores at a lower price than the market retail price. All the goods will be sold through computerised system. To encourage people, especially from the financially weaker background, the government has claimed that it has drafted a dedicated franchise policy. Under that policy, people in the age group of 18-35 years can apply. These stores, government claims, will ensure a minimum monthly earning of Rs 15,000 based on the sales made. “Priority will be given to women and youths belonging to the families that have Parivar Pehcan Patra and have an annual income of Rs 1.8 lakh or less. Each store will help the youth to earn at least Rs 15,000 per month. In case that doesn’t happen, the government will pay the difference amount,” said an HAICL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/cm-inaugurates-71-har-hith-stores-across-state-to-promote-employment/articleshow/87098222.cms||---

China claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone over the past year, provoking anger in Taipei. China sent around 150 aircraft into the zone over a four-day period beginning on October 1 in a further heightening of tension between Beijing and Taipei that has sparked concern internationally. The US military said Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Dewey sailed through the waterway that separates Taiwan from China along with a Canadian frigate HMCS Winnipeg on Thursday and Friday. “The warships’ transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the commitment of the US and our allies and partners to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” it added. China’s People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theatre Command said its forces monitored the ships and “stood guard” throughout their passage. “The US and Canada colluded to provoke and stir up trouble... seriously jeopardising peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” it said. “Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. Theatre forces always maintain a high level of alert and resolutely counter all threats and provocations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-slams-us-and-canada-for-sending-warships-to-taiwan-strait/articleshow/87097213.cms||---
---||World||Son of Somali ex-political aide held for UK stabbing||NAIROBI/ LONDON: Ali Harbi Ali, the son of an ex-media adviser to a former PM of Somalia, has been arrested by British police under anti-terrorism laws following the killing of lawmaker David Amess, a source close to the investigation and British media said. Amess, 69, from PM Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party, was knifed repeatedly as he met constituency voters in a church on Friday in Leigh-on-Sea, east of London. Police said they had arrested a 25-year-old British man at the scene on suspicion of murder and have said it is believed he acted alone. They have not named the suspect but used additional powers under antiterrorism laws to detain him until October 22. A British source close to the investigation named Ali Harbi Ali, a British citizen, as the detained suspect. A Sky News report said on Sunday that the suspect had made an appointment to see the lawmaker via the constituency office. The BBC reported that several years ago, Ali had been referred to a government programme known as Prevent, which aims to keep people from being drawn to extremist ideas on social media. But his name has not been on any terrorism watch lists, according to the broadcaster. Police and security services believe he acted alone and was “self-radicalised”, The Sunday Times said, while adding he may have been inspired by al-Shabaab, al-Qaidalinked Islamists in Somalia. Harbi Ali Kullane, the father of Ali Harbi Ali, told The Sunday Times that his son had been arrested in connection with the murder. “At this particular moment we are going through (an)unprecedented and horrific situation,” Harbi Ali Kullane, a former adviser to Hassan Ali Khaire, a former Somali PM, said in an email when asked about this. “Due to the ongoing investigation I am commanded not to talk about it,” said Kullane, who is a former director of the Somali government’s media and communication department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/son-of-somali-ex-political-aide-held-for-uk-stabbing/articleshow/87097245.cms||---
---||World||Covid pill sparks calls for access for poor countries||The plan to roll out Merck & Co’s promising antiviral pill to treat Covid-19 risks repeating the inequities of vaccine distribution, potentially leaving the nations with the greatest need once again at the back of the line, international health groups say. For example, only about 5% of Africa’s population is immunised, creating an urgent need for therapeutics that could keep people out of hospitals. That compares with more than a 70% inoculation rate in most wealthy nations. Merck on October 11 applied for US emergency clearance of the first pill for Covid-19 after it cut hospitalisations and deaths by 50% in a large clinical trial. The medicine could gain authorisation as soon as December. The firm has taken the unusual pandemic step of licencing several generics of its antiviral molnupiravir before its branded version was even authorised for marketing. But international health officials said even that is not enough for the pill to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers, while noting shortcomings and red tape among global organisations that could further slow distribution. In addition, its licencing deals with eight Indian drugmakers will allow cheaper generic versions for109 low- and middleincome countries including in Africa, a move international groups acknowledge is a positive concession. But as wealthy nations secure molnupiravir deals — the US has already locked up 1.7 million courses with an option for 3.5 million more by January 2023 at about $700 per course — concerns grow over who might be left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-pill-sparks-calls-for-access-for-poor-countries/articleshow/87097279.cms||---

Justice Arun Monga passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by NPCIL. The corporation has argued that land for the project was acquired under the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy 2007, under which there was no provision for jobs to the oustees. The counsel representing the corporation contended that, as for the provision of employment to the oustees for land acquired by the state government on behalf of the petitioner, the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2010, is not applicable to his client. ‘No such undertaking given by corporation’It was further argued that the petitioner’s obligation under the land acquisition scheme is confined only to providing monetary compensation and certain other incentives. It was also argued that, in any case, the responsibility of providing jobs to land oustees by the petitioner can be fastened on the petitioner corporation only in case an undertaking qua the same was given by it, before initiation of acquisition proceedings. NPCIL claimed before the HC that no such undertaking was given by the corporation, a government of India entity. “Given the specialised nature of work undertaken by the nuclear power corporation, it has its own norms of employing human resource depending upon the expertise involved therein,” the petitioner has contended. The corporation has sought directions to quash the order dated January 19, 2021, passed by the additional chief secretary (power department) Haryana, through which an obligation has been imposed upon it to provide jobs to land oustees under Haryana’s Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2010. The state government had acquired around 1,500-acre land from farmers of Gorakhpur, Kajalheri and Badopal for the nuclear power project, affecting 847. The majority of the land was from Gorakhpur village. Inaugurated on January 1, 2014, by then PM Manmohan Singh, the Rs 23,502 crore NPCIL project would be the country’s largest nuclear power plant. The construction of the project is currently going on but the farmers whose land was acquired have been seeking jobs for at least one member of their family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-stays-haryana-jobs-to-oustees-order-to-npcil/articleshow/87097240.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Business||Toyota, Suzuki tieup may extend to EVs, green tech||NEW DELHI: For the first time ever, a Maruti car is expected to roll out of Toyota’s factory in India as the two Japanese carmakers give finishing touches to a new premium SUV — a competitor to Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, and VW Taigun — strengthening their relationship which may now be extended to green vehicles, including hybrids and electrics. Top sources told TOI that the new SUV has been in the works for more than a year and will be a collaborative effort of the product development, design, engineering and sourcing teams of Toyota as well as Maruti’s parent Suzuki. R&D and component sourcing teams within Maruti have also played a key part in the development of the vehicle which is likely to hit the Indian market by the second half of next year. The collaboration between the two companies is likely to get aggressive, especially after the Indian government announced a Rs 26,000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme focused only on electrics and hydrogen-fuel cell vehicles. “While the original plan of the companies was to look at strong hybrids and other electrified versions (running on both battery and petrol), now the thoughts are being focused around pure electrics and even fuel cells. These are preliminary discussions, and nothing has been finalised as yet. However, it can be said with certainty that it’s a joint future,” one of the sources said. Talking about the premium SUV, the source said that investments for the vehicle which has been developed ground-up – are estimated at over Rs 1,000 crore. “It’s an ambitious product, and perhaps the first collaborative all-new vehicle that the two companies have developed together.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/toyota-suzuki-tieup-may-extend-to-evs-green-tech/articleshow/87097357.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Gurgaon||Experts point at flaws, NHAI says measures in place||Gurgaon: All “speed calming measures” and norms laid down by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) are in place on the U-turn flyover at IFFCO Chowk, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said, even as road safety experts alleged that flyovers across NCR were planned keeping cars and not two-wheelers in mind. The safety of these structures have come under the spotlight on Sunday after two bikers died allegedly after they lost balance and toppled over the railing of the flyover 20 feet below. “This kind of incident has not happened (on the flyover) before and most likely occurred due to over speeding on the part of the commuter. From our end, all safety measures have been taken from the very first day. All speed calming measures are in place. We have also put signage alerting people to the speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour and have installed four rows of cat's eye where the curvature of the flyover begins so that the speed of a vehicle gets reduced automatically,” an NHAI official, who did not want to be identified, told TOI. Speed breakers, as per the NHAI, cannot be put on these elevated roads because there was a chance of vehicles jumping on these as well. Used by commuters travelling from MG Road and Huda City Centre towards Delhi and Sukhrali, the four-lane unidirectional flyover was constructed and opened to commuters in 2018. “Chevron boards that warn drivers of the curve ahead, and other relevant signage have been also installed at the curvature. The height of the boundary wall is also as per the IRC standards. Multiple safety audits of the structure have not shown any discrepancies,” the official added. Road safety experts with whom TOI spoke, however, said that such accidents were increasing not just in Gurgaon but across the NCR and the rest of the country. Multiple factors, they say, are responsible for this. “One of the issues is that these structures are normally designed for cars without taking two-wheelers into consideration. The U-turns and ramps on the interchanges are, however, also used by two-wheelers, which tend to then move at the same speed as a car but may not be necessarily safe for them. In addition, side crash protections are not taken into consideration, as a result of which commuters topple over because sufficient protection has not been given on the side of the structure and the sidewall has not been correctly designed,” Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban roads design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture, said. Ram recommended the usage of “low-height speed-calming measures” and designing “forgiving roads”. “What forgiving roads do is that if there are three lanes, the outer lane, closest to the boundary wall, is painted in such a way as to alert the commuters not to drive on it. So, if by mistake a person’s vehicle starts skidding, the outer lane serves as a buffer, ensuring they will skid onto the lane but not fall down. The logic of forgiving measures is that if a person does make a mistake, they do not pay with their life,” Ram said. Rohit Baluja, director of the Institute of Road Traffic Education, meanwhile, attributed such mishaps to the absence of traffic engineering within the traffic management system and emphasised the need to follow the principles of a “safe systems approach”, which anticipates mistakes of commuters and implies taking measures to ensure that people do not die or sustain serious injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/experts-point-at-flaws-nhai-says-measures-in-place/articleshow/87091752.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Wheels turning for new Civil Hospital? Gurugram health department to submit plan in a week||GURUGRAM: To get approval for an upcoming 400-bed Civil Hospital — to replace the exciting building in Civil Lines — the health department of Gurugram on Sunday said that it will submit a new plan to the Haryana government within a week. The hospital project has faced several hurdles so far. Built about 50 years ago, the hospital has witnessed at least six incidents of ceiling collapse in the past two years. In a report, the public works department (PWD) had recommended that the entire hospital building be pulled down to avoid further mishaps. “We had shared a plan for a 500-bed hospital but after careful analysis, it was modified to 400. We will be sharing details of the new building plan with Haryana within a week,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. The new plan includes two basement parking lots, CT-MRI, radiology, oncology, a diagnostic area, OPDs, injection room, nebulisation room and an immunisation room, as well as microbiology, clinical pathology, molecular and biochemistry units. Moreover, apart from a haematology unit, there will be blood component preparation and storage areas, a laboratory for blood group serology and a transfusion centre too. The facility will also have a haemophilia and thalassemia daycare centre, psychiatry, de-addiction and mental health centres, labour room complex, ICUs, an operation theatre, TB centre, Ayush block, ambulance office, and separate surgical, orthopaedic, cancer, burns and paediatrics wards. Residential areas will also be earmarked for the Gurugram civil surgeon, the principal medical officer and other doctors. The budget will be approved after the government gives the plan a go-ahead. Last year, Rs 260 crore was approved for the revamp. This is likely to go up with the addition of new components. As per the plan, the old hospital site, which is spread over seven acres, will be expanded to nine acres by using a portion of land from the adjoining government senior secondary boys’ school. However, the project has been stuck as the land acquisition process was delayed. At present, the education department has provided a no-objection certificate to the health department to enable it to use the two acres of land for the building expansion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/wheels-turning-for-new-civil-hospital-health-department-to-submit-plan-in-a-week/articleshow/87091805.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Sewer line damaged, mosquitoes breeding in marsh: Gurugram residents||GURUGRAM: A group of residents from N Block in Mayfield Garden have complained about sewage flowing near a damaged septic tank in the locality and stench emanating from it. They said the area has become a ground for mosquitoes to breed. Part of a road near the underground tank had caved in recently damaging the sewage line. “Sometime back, a portion of the road near the tank caved in. Now, there is a constant flow of sewage water here and the place has become a mosquito breeding ground. The place smells foul and several people have complained about it,” Dharam Vir Yadav, a resident of the colony, said. “Neither the developer nor the civic authorities are paying attention to our problems. We do not have the means to repair the road and the sewage lines on our own. But the repairs have to be done on priority,” Yadav added. The developer had built the underground tank on a commercial plot in the colony. But in 2014, when the local authorities asked the developer to connect the sewage pipelines of the area to the main network, the latter extended the existing lines and the septic tank fell into disuse. Later, the builder constructed a road near it. Most residents said that the sewage network in the colony is in a bad state due to lack of maintenance for several years. “We have been suffering for many years. The process of transferring colonies to the MCG is a very slow one. As a result of that, most of our civic issues remain unresolved,” said colony resident Jeevagan Nadar. A senior MCG official said that a detailed project report of the colony is being prepared and it is likely to be submitted to the department of town and country planning (DTCP) by the first week of November. “We will hold a meeting with developers of 11 private colonies soon and a deadline will be fixed for transfer. Regarding this particular issue, I will ask officials to look into the matter and see what can be done about it,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sewer-line-damaged-mosquitoes-breeding-in-marsh-residents/articleshow/87091839.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Ramchandra Sharma was returning home after attending an event when saw a car parked in the middle of the road outside his house. He blew the horn several times and asked three men to move the car out of his way. But the three men, identified as Sagar, Badal and Kaku, allegedly abused him. According to the police complaint filed by Sharma, nearly 20 men barged into his house a few minutes later, armed with sticks and rods. Sharma alleged that the group not only thrashed him, but also pushed his wife and two children. Sharma was pinned to the ground and punched repeatedly in the face, the FIR said. “Whoever came in their way was thrashed. Nearly 15 people, including a few neighbours, were roughed up. His wife was also held by the hair. They were taken to a private hospital for treatment,” said a neighbour. An FIR has been registered at Palam Vihar police station under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (insult the modesty of a woman) and 511 (attempting to commit offences). “An investigation is underway.

They were earlier paying 12%. While some local companies have hiked MRP by Rs 2, most others are looking at ways to exit the crowded market where Rs 10 is the average MRP. “Almost all local players had stopped manufacturing carbonated soft drinks after they realised that adding fruit to the drinks attracted lower taxes,” said the owner of one of the largest regional beverage makers. “A large percentage of them, however, was adding less than the required amount to earn a quick buck.” While adding fruit juice to carbonated drinks costs around 5% more for a manufacturer, TOI was the first to report that most of them were under the lens for allegedly evading taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/local-soft-drink-companies-hit-by-gst-hike/articleshow/87097414.cms||John Sarkar

The last time such a high number was recorded was in 2016 when 621 dengue cases were reported between January and December. Officials said this time, most cases have been recorded from Muradnagar followed by Govindpuram and Vijay Nagar. Of the 624 dengue cases recorded since January this year, 312 (50%) were between October 1 and 17. Meanwhile, a month-long special drive against vector-borne diseases that was supposed to begin across the state from Monday, will now start from Tuesday, officials have said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will flag off the campaign from Basti. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said: “Around 100 cases have been recorded in and around Muradnagar, which is now the main area of concern for us. Several health department teams are carrying out fogging and anti-larvae solution spraying drives. We are organising 10-12 medical camps in the area daily. Fever patients are being tested for dengue and malaria.” Officials said that additional laboratory technicians have been deputed at primary health centres for dengue testing. According to official records, in 2016, 621 dengue, 1,024 chikungunya and 128 malaria cases were reported. One dengue death was also recorded. Since then, no chikungunya cases have been detected in the district. In 2017, 232 dengue cases were recorded and the number of malaria cases was 293. The following year, 68 dengue and 150 malaria cases were recorded. In 2019, the district detected 88 dengue and 142 malaria cases. Last year, 15 dengue and 13 malaria cases were reported between January and December. This year, 16 malaria cases have been detected so far. Since January, 381 dengue patients have needed hospitalisation and 2,094 people have been tested for dengue fever. “The CM will launch the special campaign from Basti on Tuesday. All districts will start the drive that day,” a message circulated among health officials has said. The district magistrate will review the work done during the campaign every week. Dr Gupta said all preparations are in place for the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-dengue-case-count-highest-since-2016/articleshow/87092025.cms||Aditya Dev

On Sunday, 17 new cases were recorded in Noida, taking this year’s tally to 210, which is the highest in the past 10 years. As part of the survey, officials will check for mosquito breeding grounds and open containers in which water might get collected. Recently, an extensive survey was conducted in the urban areas of Jewar and anti-larvae solution was sprayed. Officials said 32 people have been sent notices in Chhalera and Barola areas after mosquito breeding was found on their premises. The drive was conducted after local people said several dengue cases had been detected in the locality. “Recently, we sent a team for inspection and while several fever cases have been detected, no dengue cases were confirmed from these places. But we have conducted an extensive survey to check if people have kept open containers outside their houses where water was getting collected. We also got fogging done by the nagar panchayat,” said Rajesh Sharma, the district malaria officer. Officials said no clusters have been identified so far and the maximum number of cases reported from a particular area stands at six. “The case density is six at some places in Chhalera. The other cases are spread across the city and no area can be identified as a hotspot. When there are several cases in an area, we conduct a survey and fogging,” Sharma added. He said mosquitoes that spread dengue usually fly within a kilometre of where they breed. “People must maintain personal hygiene and should not allow water to get collected in any open container. If people don’t let mosquitoes breed, then the spread of vector-borne diseases can be controlled,” Sharma said. He added that a survey of government premises will start soon and officials will check if buildings and their surroundings are clean and if open containers are lying outdoors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/container-survey-starts-in-noida-sunday-tally-at-17/articleshow/87092063.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Ghaziabad||AOA raises issue of I’puram handover, cites recent letter||Ghaziabad: The issue of Indirapuram handover has come up once again after a local residents’ body claimed it has accessed a letter from the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) vice-chairperson to the municipal commissioner. The letter, with reference to a 1983 government order, says if any municipality starts charging house tax in an area, then it will automatically be deemed to be handed over to the civic body (Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC)). While GDA says it is ready to hand over the township to GMC, the corporation has said the authority is yet to finish infrastructure work in the area that is needed for the process. Even without a formal takeover, GMC has been charging house tax from the township’s residents for years. The local Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association (Fed AOA) has said it has accessed a letter written by the GDA vice-chairperson to the municipal commissioner in June 2021, which refers to the 1983 government order. “Because of this handover issue, the residents are suffering,” said Alok Kumar, founder, Fed AOA. “The GMC has had no problems when it comes to collecting annual house tax from about 50,000 residents since 2004. But it has not spent a dime for the upkeep of infrastructure in the area. The GMC has collected over Rs 78 crore in the last 17 years as house tax,” he added. On the other hand, municipal commissioner Mahendra Singh Tanwar said: “The GMC, according to the mandate given to us under the Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1959, is well within its rights to impose house tax on all properties under its jurisdiction and Indirapuram is within municipal limits. With regards civic amenities, it needs to be clarified that since the township has not been handed over to the GMC by the GDA, it is the responsibility of the development authority to provide for them,” he added. He said there are several issues that are coming in the way of a handover. “There are issues related to roads and sewer networks that the GDA needs to attend to before handing the place over to the GMC. Otherwise, we would need at least Rs 300 crore from the GDA for the work before the hand over,” Tanwar added. A GDA official said a joint inspection has been conducted and the authority is ready to hand over the area to the GMC “anytime”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/aoa-raises-issue-of-ipuram-handover-cites-recent-letter/articleshow/87092101.cms||Abhijay Jha

In its recommendations to the government, the Director General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) noted that there has been a surge in imports, which was undercutting domestic prices. “The domestic industry has suffered serious injury, as established by significant deterioration in its overall performance, in respect of parameters such as market share, production, sales, capacity utilisation, and profitability, which have sharply declined in the most recent period,” it said, adding that the increase was due to unforeseen situation. While acknowledging the increase was partly driven by the demand for hand sanitisers during Covid, DGTR said that the proposed action on isopropyl alcohol could be put on hold by the government in case the pandemic flared up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-may-check-import-of-key-sanitiser-ingredient/articleshow/87097465.cms||Sidhartha

There are an estimated 48 people in the city who are undergoing hospitalization after the dengue sting. Health department had anticipated dengue and malaria cases to decline in the last three weeks. However, with rainfall spell for two days, the anticipation could fall short. “The recent rainfall has been heavy and would contribute to breeding of larvae and prolong the infection season,” said an official.

Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) officials, however, expect some respite from Monday with a forecast of rainfall and good wind speed. Track the pollution level in your cityOn Sunday, there was a nip in the air as the city recorded minimum temperature of 24 degrees Celsius, allowing pollutants to gather close to the ground, especially with low wind speed (11 kmph). While temperature is likely to decline further over the next few days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast some rainfall activity and higher wind speed that may help disperse pollutants, experts said. The Teri Gram station, meanwhile, recorded an AQI of 352, Sector 51 at 364 and Vikash Sadan and Gwalpahari each 331 on Sunday, which was a significant dip from the previous day. On Saturday, Teri Gram station recorded AQI at 298, Sector 51 at 342 and Vikash Sadan at 289, while it wasn’t recorded at Gwalpahari due to insufficient data. This comes at a time when the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is yet to be implemented in the region. On Monday, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas will hold a meeting with the states concerned to chalk out an action plan regarding the implementation of GRAP. Meanwhile, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and pollution watchdog said that they were working on an action plan to mitigate air pollution in the city. “Our teams have been reporting nearly six to eight open garbage burning incidents in the city daily. This is a serious issue and we have informed the MCG about the same. Teams are already taking action, however, in several incidents when our team reaches the site, we fail to find any miscreants and thus we are not able to impose any penalty,” a senior HSPCB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/aqi-dips-but-rain-may-help-in-coming-days/articleshow/87092318.cms||Ipsita Pati

He also asked the officials to prepare a list of beneficiaries and allot these flats to them within the stipulated time. To rehabilitate slum dwellers, HSVP had constructed a total of 1,088 cheap flats in 2011 and 2015. However, the flats have been lying vacant since then because the authorities are yet to prepare the list of beneficiaries. And with time, the condition of the flats has started to deteriorate. “The low-cost flats were constructed for Rs 50 crore. They are available in two sizes — 30.6 sqm and 34.3 sqmt. These will be allotted to the beneficiaries at a cost of around Rs 4 lakh,” an HSVP official said. Officials said more than 1,500 people had applied for the affordable flats. “The department and the district administration are identifying eligible beneficiaries,” the HSVP official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/repair-sector-47-flats-khattar-directs-hsvp/articleshow/87092366.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Its drone offerings — that range from manufacturing to traffic management and countering rogue drones — will account for a significant part of this planned mega investment. India currently has 6 lakh drones, a number that the French major expects will rise at least six times in 5-8 years. “Our solutions allow civil and military aviation authorities to detect — even without data transmission — and verify a drone’s registration number, identify its pilot, and confirm its flight authorisation, all in a few seconds. By the same time, to cope with unexpected or non-registered drones, detection and classification are the first steps before engaging a graduated response,” Ashish Saraf, Thales India VP & country director, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/french-company-thales-to-put-1-2-billion-in-india-over-5-years/articleshow/87097597.cms||Saurabh Sinha

One of the injured was a student at the university, while the rest were not, Grambling State posted on Twitter. The shooting took place about 1 a.m. during homecoming weekend, it said.  Further homecoming events planned for Sunday were canceled, and classes were canceled for Monday and Tuesday. A curfew was imposed on campus from 9:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. until further notice, the school said.  The shooting came just days after a non-student was fatally shot by another non-student early on Wednesday in front of the university's Favrot Student Union building, Grambling State said. Two students fleeing the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries on Wednesday. That incident also occurred around 1 a.m., officials said.  The university said on Wednesday it would increase security on campus after that shooting.  Louisiana State Police, who are investigating both incidents, said the two shootings are believed to be unrelated.

---||Business||China's Q3 economic growth slows to 4.9%||BEIJING: China's economy grew at the slowest pace in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages, supply bottlenecks and sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks and raising heat on policymakers amid rising jitters over the property sector. Data released on Monday showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.9% in July-September from earlier, the weakest pace since the third quarter of 2020 and slowing from 7.9% in the second quarter. That marked a further deceleration from the 18.3% expansion in the first quarter, when the year-on-year growth rate was heavily flattered by the very low comparison seen during the Covid-induced slump of early 2020. A Reuters poll of analysts had expected GDP to rise 5.2% in the third quarter. On a quarterly basis, growth eased to 0.2% in July-September from a downwardly revised 1.2% in the second quarter, the data showed. The world's second-largest economy has rebounded from the pandemic but the recovery is losing steam, weighed by faltering factory activity, persistently soft consumption and a slowing property sector as policy curbs bite. "In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies," said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. Global worries about a possible spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader economy have also intensified as major developer China Evergrande Group wrestles with more than $300 billion of debt. Chinese leaders, fearful that a persistent property bubble could undermine the country's long-term ascent, are likely to maintain tough curbs on the sector even as the economy slows, but could soften some tactics as needed, policy sources and analysts said. Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that China has ample tools to cope with economic challenges despite slowing growth, and the government is confident of achieving full-year development goals Analysts polled by Reuters expected the PBOC to keep banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) unchanged in the fourth quarter, before delivering another 50-basis points cut in the first quarter of 2022. September industrial output rose 3.1% from a year earlier, missing expectations and down from August's 5.3%. Retail sales grew 4.4% in September, up from 2.5% in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/chinas-q3-economic-growth-slows-to-4-9/articleshow/87097665.cms||---

Police said that the accused were identified as Anand Verma, Shiv Kumar, Bablu Verma and Deepak Verma and all of them received bullet injuries during an encounter. The gang has several cases registered against them in Delhi, Mathura and Rajasthan and the members also served jail terms in other states. The gang was allegedly involved in over a dozen cases of robbery and assault in the district and was infamous as “screwdriver gang”. They would offer lift to people, attack them using a screwdriver and later, rob them or take them to an ATM booth and force them to withdraw money. Anil Kumar, SHO of Beta-2 police station, said that the gang has been active in the area for the past eight months and would often target senior citizens. “All four arrested accused were members of the screwdriver gang and have confessed to the crimes.

The Authority has launched the builder plot scheme, under which four plots will be allotted to builders for construction. The plots are a total of 1.21 lakh sqm in size and will earn revenue worth around Rs 400 crore for GNIDA. To promote affordable housing in the city, all plots will also have reserved flats for EWS (economically weaker sections) and LIG (low-income groups). The scheme includes a plot of 23,500 sqm in Sector Zeta 1, a plot of 28,265 sqm in Sector Eta 2 and two plots of 39,321 sqm and 30,000 sqm in Sector Sigma 3. “Learning from our mistakes regarding builder schemes, we will try to allot the plots only to bonafide builders who will deliver the flats on time to the buyers. With increasing investment in Greater Noida in the past three-four years, the employment generation has also increased. Along with this, there has been a rise in people looking for flats and wanting to settle here. This is why the scheme seems timely and necessary,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO, GNIDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/plot-scheme-for-ews-launched/articleshow/87094794.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As per estimates, there are 5.5 crore people who are fit for Covid-19 vaccination in the state and of these, only 4.91 crore have got the first dose of vaccine in the state till now. This is despite the fact that the state had set a target of vaccinating each and every eligible individual by at least the first dose till September 27. Vaccination started in the state on February 7. Later vaccination for those above 45 years of age started from March 1 while vaccination of beneficiaries aged above 18 years started from May 5. From May 5 onwards all type of vaccination had started in the state. Following initial hiccups, vaccination drive gained momentum and as on date, Madhya Pradesh is among the top states when it comes to administering first dose of vaccine to majority of the eligible population, going by the offcial data. Explaining the gap, sources from the health department attribute three major reasons that has led to this gap of 58 lakh. “The population projections may not be correct as it is more than the voter list. Secondly, dead, seriously ill or permanently migrated or temporary migrated people are being counted in the estimates. Moreover, there is still vaccine hesitancy.” Government had sought data related to migratory population along with their Aadhar and contact data from the districts which were reporting migratory population. However, the data has not been made public. Sources said that if it is accepted at the government level that first dose of vaccination of each and every individual is complete and those left are migratory population, it will have negative impact on the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/58-lakh-yet-to-get-even-first-jab-of-vaccine-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/87097806.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Bengaluru||After Dasara holidays, more schools in Bengaluru to hold only regular classes||With Covid-19 cases continuing to dip, many private schools in Bengaluru, that until now offered online classes or a hybrid arrangement, are switching completely to on-campus mode. Regular classes for grades 9-12 began from August 23 and from September 6 for grades 6-8. However, most private schools continued with online classes as parents were wary of sending their children to schools. Others offered a hybrid model where teachers live streamed classes to those logging on online. Now, parents say many schools have issued circulars saying children will have to come to school after the Dasara break. “It is extremely difficult for teachers to continue both online and offline classes,” said D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka. “Several schools do not have the human resources or infrastructure for a hybrid arrangement, and teachers are overburdened as it is double work for them. With cases reducing, some schools have asked students to come to classes.” Government schools and many budget schools had resumed oncampus classes about a month ago. But some parents of students in private schools are apprehensive about sending their wards to school. Transportation is their biggest concern. “The auto driver who used to ferry my child has left the city and we are still trying to find transport for my daughter. BMTC buses are too risky because of the crowd,” said a parent from South Bengaluru. R Vishal, commissioner of public instruction, said: “Regular classes are a default option. However, we understand some parents are apprehensive. If schools have the resources to manage online and offline classes, I don’t think we should constitutionally interfere. But our intention is not to just provide online classes. Students have lost one-and-a-half years and the social skills that come with attending school. I am not sure whether online alone will be helpful for anybody.” On the issue of schools scrapping online classes, he said: “These are schools which do not have sufficient resources to conduct both regular and online classes. It is a conscious decision. The sooner parents and the school ecosystem decide on this, the better for everyone.” Regular classes in government schools are in full swing now. The department of public instruction has also sought permission to resume classes for primary sections from November 2. Midday meals will be available from October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-dasara-holidays-more-schools-in-bengaluru-to-hold-only-regular-classes/articleshow/87097865.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
