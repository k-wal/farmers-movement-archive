This is the second ‘encounter’ by state police in a week. A 28-year-old man from Jharkhand, who had allegedly snatched a chain from a woman near Sriperumbudur in Kancheepuram district, was killed in an ‘encounter’ earlier this week. The superintendent of police (SP) of Tuticorin district denied that Friday’s incident was an encounter. He claimed that the history-sheeter, V Duraimurugan, 40, was killed when police fired at him in self-defense when he attacked two cops with a machete. Duraimurugan of Koottaampuli near Pudukottai is the prime accused in the murder of M Jegadeesh, 23, of Sivagamipuram near Pavoorchatram in Tenkasi district on October 6. Duraimurugan and his accomplices abducted Jegadeesh following a clash that arose between the two a couple of days prior to the murder. Sixteen cut injuries were inflicted on the youth before he was buried in Tirunelveli city. The body was exhumed earlier this week and a search was launched for the accused. “We launched a search for Duraimurugan as he is from our district,” SP Jayakumar told reporters after visiting the encounter scene on Friday afternoon. The SP’s special team led by sub inspector Raja Prabhu got information that Duraimurugan along with two of his associates were in a hideout at Kovalam near Muthiahpuram. Jayakumar said that the SI was accompanied by three constables when they spotted Duraimurugan. “While his two accomplices fled, constable David Raja was chasing the history-sheeter. After running for about 50 meters he turned back to attack David Raja with a machete, landing a cut on the left hand of the constable,” the SP said and added that it was then the SI fired into the air and asked Duraimurugan to surrender. “But the history sheeter attacked Raja Prabhu with the machete and inflicted a cut on his left hand. As self-defense the SI fired three rounds at Duraimurugan. The accused was sent to the Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. His body has been kept at the hospital for autopsy,” the SP said. Police said that the SI had six bullets in his official 9mm pistol of which four were fired – a warning shot and three on the history sheeter. The injured police constable and SI were admitted to a hospital. The SP who inquired about the incident said that the duo was in a state of shock. Cases in eight districtsJayakumar said that Duraimurugan has cases in eight districts including Madurai, Tuticorin, Tiruvannamalai, Nagapattinam, Kanyakumari, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram over a period of two decades. In Madurai he has cases in Oomachikulam, Othakadai, Perungudi, Anna Nagar, S S Colony and Teppakulam police stations. Most of his murders were abduction, followed by brutal murders. According to police, Duraimurugan is also known for landing in trouble for eve-teasing. He is an accused in the murder of Srinivasan in 2001, T Selvam, Rajinikanth and Stalin of Tuticorin in separate incidents in 2003, Balamurugan of Tiruvannamali in 2010, Manimozhi, 44, near Othakadai in Madurai in 2011 and Jegadeesh of Tenkasi earlier this month. After spending nearly three-and-a-half years in jail he was released on September 3. The 28 other cases against him include 21 robberies, six thefts and an attempt to murder. The SP said that special teams are on the lookout of two of Duraimurugan’s accomplices who fled the scene on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/police-gun-down-history-sheeter-wanted-in-35-cases/articleshow/87048469.cms||M K Ananth

But there is a group that is silently countering this menace by creating awareness among motorists about the flip side of giving money to beggars. “If you want to stop human trafficking and end kidnap of children and the elderly, then stop giving money to beggars,” plead members of a group named Bengaluru Huduguru, which is opposing cartels that have been discreetly promoting beggars in the city. The 30-member group is led by 36-year-old Vinod Kartavya, engineer with an aeronautical establishment and a resident of Sampangiramanagar. He and his team have been standing at busy traffic junctions for nine weeks carrying placards with appeals on not to distribute money among beggars. In fact, his group was in the spotlight earlier for running a campaign that aimed at freeing trees of nails and banners. On why they were focussing on beggary, Vinod told TOI: “I was returning home when I found a woman holding a baby and begging at the traffic signal near MG Road. When the baby started crying, the irked woman stepped aside, pulled out a cloth that was laced with some chemical and forced the baby to sniff it by placing it near the nose. The baby went to sleep and the woman resumed begging. When I questioned the woman about what she did, she started hurling expletives and silenced me. I realised that children were being sedated to appeal to the emotions of motorists.” The incident spurred him into action. “We volunteers started our campaign on August 15 with the hope of freeing the city and country of beggars. We started from Town Hall Junction and have carried out weekly campaigns at nine traffic signals,” he said. Alleging that there is a mafia that is behind deployment of beggars at different traffic junctions, Bengaluru Hudugaru has been requesting people not to make the mafia stronger by giving money to beggars. Prem, a volunteer, asked: “Why should children be selling roses, pens and earbuds at traffic junctions when the government provides free meals and education? Beggars earn thousands of rupees per day because of the pity shown by people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stop-giving-money-to-beggars-campaigners/articleshow/87048735.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Computer science at IIT-Bombay preference of many JEE toppers from Karnataka||BENGALURU: For JEE-Advanced toppers from Karnataka, the preferred course to pursue is the obvious -- computer science engineering in the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. Veeresh B Patil has secured All India rank 39 in JEE-Advanced and is the Karnataka state topper. A student of Oxford Independent PU College, he had scored 600 out of 600 in II PU, topped the Comed-K rank list and came 7th in CET. The results of JEE-Advanced was announced on Friday. Veeresh said he would opt for CS in IIT-Bombay. “I want to do engineering as it involves a lot of analytical skills. I don’t have a specific liking for a branch. But CS offers the opportunity to explore a broader domain and I want to use that opportunity. And IIT-Bombay is the best in CS,” he said. Veeresh had prepared for JEE-Advanced for five years with Allen coaching centre. “It has been a long journey. It was fun as much as it was hard work. But all the efforts have paid off,” he said. His father is a software engineer and mother a homemaker. Premankur C has an All India rank of 54. A student of NPS Yelahanka, Premankur said it’s his interest in programming that has prompted him to opt for CS. Premankur, whose favourite stressbuster is playing with his cat Whiskey, said he used to study for 6-8 hours daily. “The pandemic actually saved a lot of travel time and gave me time for preparation. I attended classes regularly and took tests and reviewed them,” he said. He had gone for coaching at FIIT-JEE. Pratham Sahu, AIR 131, said he had spent 8-9 hours for the past four hours. “I did not use any social media. I was on WhatsApp, but that too only for studies. I had a fixed schedule. I played one hour of basketball every day, which was my stressbuster. Once in a while I used to break off from the regular cycle,” he said. He studied at St Jerome PU College, Sarjapur Road, and plans to choose CS in any of the top IITs. Hrishit BP, son of Dr Balaji Prasad, nephrologist who succumbed to Covid in 2019, secured All India Rank 392. A total of 14,1699 candidates appeared in both papers 1 and 2 in JEE (Advanced)-2021 and 41,862 have qualified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/computer-science-at-iit-b-preference-of-many-jee-toppers/articleshow/87049104.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC dismisses seven rebel BSP members’ petition||Bengaluru: The high court has dismissed a petition filed by seven rebel Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) councillors of the Kollegal City Municipal Council (CMC), challenging their disqualification. It noted that the splinter group created by the members after quitting one party can’t be considered a “political party.” Citing the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Karnataka Local Authorities (Prohibition of Defection) Act, 1987, Justice M Nagaprasanna said a political organisation, in relation of a councillor or a member, would mean a party only if recognised by the Election Commission as a national party or a state party in Karnataka and only then the petitioners can claim that they are protected under section 3A of the Act.“The petitioners have defected from the party and formed a splinter group. By this admitted fact, they incurred disqualification under section 3(1)(a) of the Act as they have voluntarily given up their membership of the party,” the judge noted.The judge pointed out the petitioners tendered their resignation on February29, 2020 and eight months had passed by the time the election was sought to be conducted to the office of the president and vice-president of the CMC. “The petitioners have not produced evidence to show their splinter group is a political party recognised by the Election Commission or have joined any party which is already recognised. It is not that the election has taken place immediately after their resignation. It is not open to the petitioners even to contend that they had no time either to get their splinter group recognised or join another party,” the judge said. Pavithra and six others had challenged the September 6, 2021 order of disqualification, passed by the deputy commissioner of Mysuru. They had voted in favour of BSP rebel candidate in an election held on October 29, 2020. G Jayamari, party’s official candidate, who lost the election as she could secure only 2 votes as against 17 secured by Gangamma, the rebel, had sought disqualification of the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-dismisses-seven-rebel-bsp-members-petition/articleshow/87049129.cms||---

But by the time he returned to Vidhana Soudha at 5.13am on October 13 -- cycling across the state -- he knew the downpour was only one of the many challenges en route. Under Race Around Karnataka, Dr Srinivas covered the 2,240km periphery of Karnataka in the shortest time – he took 119 hours and 13 minutes to ride through the tough but scenic route: Mulbagal-Chikkaballapura-Madhugiri-Sira-Chitradurga-Kudligi-Sandur-Ballari-Raichur-Yadgir-Bidar-Kalaburagi-Vijayapura-Jamakhandi-Belagavi-Joida-Karwar-Honnavar-Kundapur-Udupi-Mangaluru-Madikeri-Mysuru-Mandya-Bengaluru. During the four day-23 hour-13minute trip, he slept only for seven hours to clock an average speed of 18.8kmph. The ride, Dr Srinivas said, was to explore the home state and curate a route so it becomes an annual race for ultra-cyclists from India and abroad. The pandemic prompted him and his 10-member crew to curate the route. Of late, Dr Srinivas had not been able to race abroad -- his annual fix -- because of travel restrictions. So Team Srini decided to replicate here events like Race Across America (RAAM) and RAA (Race Around Austria). “When Austria with a 2,200km periphery can do it, why not Karnataka?” we asked ourselves and the result was Race Around Karnataka,” said Dr Srinivas, who is into medical services of the armed forces, currently posted in Assam. Troubles and blissBesides the downpour, 30% of the 2,240km-stretch was bad, particularly in the Kalyana Karnataka region. There were also steep stretches between Ballari and Raichur, Mangaluru and Madikeri. The total elevation gain was 15,800m. “Cycling groups from Bengaluru, Kalaburagi, Jamakhandi, Madikeri and Bidar cheered me even when I reached the places in the middle of the night,” he said. While the doctors' fraternity felicitated him in Mangaluru, coastal police created a green corridor for his smooth passage on October 10. Race Around Karnataka was a perfect homecoming for Dr Srinivas after RAAM and RAA. “North Karnataka offered breathtaking views of meadows and agriculture fields, while in Kodagu it was mountains. It's blissful to soak in the beauty of rivers Krishna, Bheema and Cauvery,” he said. Endurance cyclists Monish Calappa and Rajkumar Koth officiated the race for World Ultra-Cycling Association. Once certified, Team Srini will make Race Around Karnataka the state race from 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-doc-cycles-across-karnataka-in-119-hours/articleshow/87049132.cms||---

The miscreants had locked him up in a hotel room near Lumbini Garden on October 8. Govindapura police have taken up a case of robbery, wrongful confinement and cybercrime against the gang based on a complaint filed by Madan (name changed). Madan had come in contact with a woman two years ago after he received a fleeting ‘hi’ from an unknown number. The duo started conversing with each other and exchanged messages through WhatsApp. “I had spoken to her around 20 times before we decided to meet personally on October 8. She identified the location and I reached the hotel at 10.30pm. There were three men with her. The trio claimed they were cops. They accused me of being a drug peddler and grabbed my mobile and wallet. They forced me to unlock my phone and y did something before throwing it in the room. They fled after locking me up inside the room,” he told police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/honey-trap-gang-extorts-6l-from-man/articleshow/87049133.cms||---

They garlanded potholes on the road, lit incense sticks, did arati using camphor and distributed puffed rice among passersby, apparently to draw the authorities’ attention to the perennial problem. “We performed puja to potholes so that they do not take more lives,” said a civic activist sarcastically. They were peeved at the BBMP's lackadaisical attitude in fixing the menace, which has claimed several lives and injured many others in the last couple of months.  “Bengaluru’s roads are filled with potholes and the government does not have any interest in fixing it, so we could only pray to the pothole not to harm people. In olden days, people would worship gods requesting them not to make sacrifices. There was ‘plague Mariamma’ who was worshipped during the times of plague. We used the same idea here,” said Anand Begur, a resident. “The roads need urgent attention. Despite numerous orders by the high court, BBMP has failed to ensure proper roads for the citizens,” said Kavitha Reddy, civic activist of HSR Layout. MG Sudheendra, another activist, said: “If BBMP does not feel ashamed, doubt anything else would bother them. The government wants us to be accountable by following traffic rules. Why aren’t they accountable for something as small as ensuring motorable roads?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/irked-they-resort-to-pothole-puja/articleshow/87049139.cms||Nithya Mandyam

In his memorandum submitted to the president of the UNHRC, Geneva, Nuzhat Shameem, Chrungoo, a popular Kashmiri Pandit leader, said that Pakistan supported terrorists in Kashmir. “Last year also we had brought up the issue of killings of political grassroot representatives and other minority community members in the Valley to your notice. We earnestly request the Council to view this whole issue in perspective of the continued ethnic cleansing of Hindus and Sikhs in the valley,” the letter read. “National Human Rights Commission (of India) observed recently in this connection that, “the painful incidents of killing of civilians allegedly by the terrorists are a serious threat to the democratic fibre of the country and people’s right to life, liberty, equality and dignity,” Chrungoo wrote. “Targeted killings of those who are not Kashmiri Muslims is an attempt to keep non-Muslims out of the Valley. It is a gross violation of human rights of minority communities in the Valley, which must be stopped.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kp-leader-chrungoo-writes-to-unhrc-on-selective-killings-of-minorities-in-kashmir/articleshow/87049231.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

With this, the toll in the gun-battle – that first broke out at Chamrer forest of Surankote on October 11 – rose to seven. On October 12, one JCO and four jawans were killed. The encounter, which started in Poonch, later stretched to Rajouri district. Searches were being carried out to flush out remaining armed terrorists hiding in the woods along the LoC. The two Army personnel -- Rifleman Vikram Singh Negi (26) from Tehri Garhwal and Rifleman Yogambar Singh (27) of Chamoli -- belonged to Uttarakhand. “A counter terrorist operation by the Army is in progress in the area of Nar Khas forest of Mendhar in Poonch since the evening of October 14. The operation is still in progress till the last report came in,” said Jammu-based defence PRO Lt Col Devender Anand. “The terrorists had been hiding in the forests of Rajouri-Poonch districts," he said, suggesting they might be the same ones involved in Monday's encounter that led to five casualties on the Army’s side. "After the initial encounter at Charmer village of Surankote on Monday, the terrorists had fled to nearby Bhangai village of Rajouri, leading to another encounter," an official said. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami expressed grief over the incident in which the two riflemen lost their lives and said “the nation can never forget their supreme sacrifice”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-more-soldiers-killed-in-counter-terrorist-operation-in-poonch-toll-rises-to-7/articleshow/87049302.cms||---

---||World||Bhupen Khakhar painting of Indian working classes drinking chai expected to fetch crores at Sotheby’s auction||LONDON: A Bhupen Khakhar oil painting titled "Krishna Hotel" depicting ordinary Indians having snacks and chai on battered-looking café tables, which has not been seen in public since 1972, is expected to fetch crores when it is auctioned at Sotheby’s in London on October 26. The estimated price is £200,000 (Rs 2 crore) to £400,000 (Rs 4 crore). But it is expected to fetch much more during the live auction. "Krishna Hotel" dates to a watershed moment in Mumbai-born Khakhar’s artistic career — the beginning of his "trade series", in which the working-classes of India, which had been mostly excluded from the sophisticated realm of art, suddenly found a place for themselves in his paintings. The first trade series work by the artist to appear on the open market, "De-Luxe Tailors", sold at Sotheby’s in 2017 for £1.1 million (Rs 11 crore). "Krishna Hotel" has been in the collection of American expat and Pune-based architect Christopher Benninger, who has designed many of South Asia’s most important buildings, for almost half a century. Benninger bought the painting soon after it was painted in 1972 at a small auction of paintings from the New Order bookshop in Ahmedabad. The exhibition was organised by the shop owner, Dinkar Trivedi, to support Bangladeshi refugees who were flooding into India at the time. Khakhar was not known then but was Benninger’s friend. Benninger first travelled to India in the 1960s when he met a number of Baroda Group artists, including Khakhar. Khakar only made it onto the international market in 2016 following a Tate Modern exhibition and Benninger overlooked the value of the work until now. "In 1972 I saw this painting as a radical break away from the dull, lifeless, often geometric modernism sweeping the world," Benninger said. The proceeds will be used to create a non-profit foundation to support artists across South Asia. "‘Hotel’ is the colloquial term used by working class Indians to describe a café, especially in smaller towns, where the emerging middle and working classes intermingled," explained Ishrat Kanga, head of modern & contemporary South Asian Art at Sotheby’s London. "The radio, a luxury at the time, has pride of place above the café’s owner, next to a framed photograph of one of the owner’s ancestors, another hallmark of middle-class aesthetics." "‘Krishna Hotel’ appears at first glance a social painting, and yet is pervaded by an unsettling sense of isolation and loneliness, by both the physical space that divides the hotels’ patrons and their forlorn expressions," Kanga said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/bhupen-khakhar-painting-of-indian-working-classes-drinking-chai-expected-to-fetch-crores-at-sothebys-auction/articleshow/87049557.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Goa||Goa Pro League: Sporting Clube eye hat-trick of titles||Panaji: The much-awaited Goa Professional League returns after almost six months as Sporting Clube de Goa kickstart their title defence against Panjim Footballers at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa on Saturday. Having won the titles for two seasons in a row – once jointly with Churchill Bros (2019-20) — Sporting will look to register a rare hat-trick of titles. “We have to fight to win the title once again,” said Sporting coach Savio Vaz. “We have the same squad where everybody knows each other. People will enjoy our football.” The crowd, fortunately, will return to the stadium, although Covid-19 restrictions mean the Goa Football Association will allow limited spectators. Whoever manages to book a seat will enjoy the show. Not long ago, the state league served as a pre-season for Goa’s top I-League teams. But since the withdrawal of Sporting, Dempo SC and Salgaocar FC from the top-tier in 2016, it has turned into a platform for budding footballers. The league continues to generate interest. Scouts from Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League clubs will keep a hawk’s eye over proceedings, keen to identify players who can make the big jump. Just last season, they found quite a few. Sporting centre-back Kunal Kundaikar joined FC Goa while midfielder Gaurav Kankonkar found favour with Kerala Blasters FC. Salgaocar defender Daniel Gomes and FC Goa’s developmental player Sarineo Fernandes were roped in by SC East Bengal. Even village teams like Guardian Angel SC proved their worth in unearthing talent. Their striker Beneston Barretto joined I-League champions Gokulam Kerala FC and scored two goals in three Durand Cup appearances. The league will also witness the return of Cavin Lobo. The former India midfielder, along with goalkeeper Luis Barretto, has joined Vasco SC, coached by their former teammate Micky Fernandes. “The team has built a good chemistry after the inclusion of Cavin and Luis. Players are now more motivated,” said Micky. Vasco were leading the standings last season and then lost their way. Salgaocar were also not far away from the title until their controversial defeat in the last round game against Calangute Association. “We have to first focus to finish in the top six and qualify for the Super League,” said Salgaocar coach Anthony Pereira. “Then we will surely aim for the title. Last edition, the result in our final game was the difference.” Dempo coach Samir Naik has promoted nine players from their junior team and will try to do better than their runnersup finish. They will be upbeat after edging out Sporting in the season-opening charity match. Churchill Bros – who will field a separate team here, different from I-League – and FC Goa’s developmental side will have a clutch of talented youngsters but whether they have the winning mentality remains to be seen. Other participating teams include Velsao SCC, Youth Club of Manora, Calangute Association and Sesa FA, who finished at the bottom but were retained by GFA in a Covid season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pro-league-returns-with-lots-of-promise/articleshow/87049592.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The incident took place a week after dozens of people were killed in a bloody attack on a Shia mosque during the congregation prayers in the northern province of Kunduz. The previous attack was claimed by the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), a regional affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Local residents said that three blasts took place, one after another, at Bibi Fatima mosque in the heart of the Kandahar city. Two similar terrorist attacks on a minority community within seven days during the busiest congregation prayers of the week indicate that the security threat from the terror outfits in the war-battered country poses the biggest challenge for the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. By sending three suicide bombers against a non-strategic, non-combatant target in Kandahar, Afghan analyst Abdul Haq Omari said, all regional powers should worry about the depths and confidence of the terrorist group in its recruitment effort. These attacks also busted the myth of the Taliban security card played by the group by claiming that they were the only ones who could ensure security to the country. The attack in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second biggest city with a population of six million and considered to be a Taliban stronghold and the spiritual birthplace of the group’s movement, seemed to have sent the message that no place is safe in the war-torn country. Taking to Twitter, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the attack and wrote: “The Islamic Emirate condemns the barbaric attack on civilians in a mosque in Kandahar. We have directed the security forces to find the perpetrators of such grave crimes as soon as possible and bring them to justice.” He extended his government’s deepest condolences to the families of the victims. Interior ministry spokesman Syed Khosti said the explosion took place in the mosque of the Shia brotherhood in the police district one (PD-1) of Kandahar city. “Special forces of the Islamic Emirate have arrived in the area to determine the nature of the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice,” Khosti added. He appealed to the people to donate blood to help the victims. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed dozens of dead bodies lying on blood-soaked prayer mats inside the mosque’s prayer hall while volunteers were trying to rescue the injured. While no group has accepted responsibility for the latest attack, it bore the fingerprints of the ISKP, which has so far targeted Afghan security forces, politicians and former top government officials, the Taliban, religious minorities including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations. The ISKP is a Sunni Muslim group and has been considered as the most extreme and violent of all the terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/35-killed-as-suicide-bombers-target-shias-in-talibans-stronghold-of-kandahar/articleshow/87049695.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Goa||India look for team effort against resolute Nepal||Just like the rough sea that kept India indoors and forced them to do the pre-final media briefing via video call from Maldives, India’s journey in the SAFF Championship too has been choppy. In the words of captain Sunil Chhetri, it’s been “topsy-turvy.” After two poor draws against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Chhetri admits they were “feeling down and had lot of doubts.” But the captain led from the front, scoring three goals in two games as India booked their place in Saturday’s final against Nepal at the National Stadium in Male. “The good thing is that we all reacted together,” said Chhetri, a goal shy of Messi’s international scoring record of 80 goals. “The manner in which we lost two points in the first two matches, wasn’t an ideal start. The senior players started talking and mixing with the juniors to make sure the mood didn’t deteriorate. After all, it was easy to get into that vicious circle where you could have started to doubt each other.” The turnaround started against Nepal – India’s opponents in the final – in a must-win game. It was Chhetri who scored the only goal of the match. Against Maldives, in another crucial game, the captain delivered again. “We are rising up every day as a team, playing better and better football which is a clear sign we need time to grow at the highest level possible. This team needs time,” said coach Igor Stimac. For the first time since he took over more than two years ago, Stimac fielded an unchanged team. Against Maldives, the defending champions, he preferred the same side that got the better of Nepal. The result was encouraging; consecutive victories for the first time and a 3-1 win, India’s biggest under the Croatian coach, since he was appointed in May 2019. For the final, though, Stimac, will be forced to make changes. Brandon Fernandes is ruled out with a knee injury and Subhashish Bose suspended. Stimac himself will watch the match from the stands after picking up a double booking against Maldives. “The players realise the importance of the final and the character on display after the first two games has been exemplary,” said assistant coach S Venkatesh, who will stand in for Stimac in the final. India have played Nepal three times in less than two months. After drawing the first game in Kathmandu, they have won twice and hardly looked in any discomfort. It’s not surprising. Nepal are ranked 60 spots below India, and even though Chhetri warned it won’t be easy, his team should start as overwhelming favourites to regain the trophy they lost in 2018. “Nepal have been the best as a team in this championship. They fight as a team, remain compact as a team and it’s not going to be easy. But we have become better and better with every game. “As a team, we have to be at our best in the final. We pulled up our socks after the first two games and now it is time to finish the job,” said Chhetri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-look-for-team-effort-against-resolute-nepal/articleshow/87049767.cms||---
---||Udaipur||Udaipur: Kin allege police inaction in Dalit girl’s suicide case||UDAIPUR: More than a week after a Dalit girl, who was allegedly molested and filmed, committed suicide in Saira village of Udaipur, her family has accused the police of inaction claiming that the investigating officer was protecting the accused. The girl had reportedly committed suicide on October 7 after her objectionable video went viral on October 5. According to the girl’s father, a boy raped his daughter and threatened her of dire consequences if she spoke about it. He lodged an FIR against the accused with the Saira police station on October 8. On October 14 the deceased’s family wrote to the IG and SP of Udaipur accusing Saira police of protecting the culprit and pressuring the family to negotiate with him. In a video posted on social media recently, the girl’s father had threatened to end his life along with other family members if he did not get justice. According to Udaipur SP Rajeev Pachaar, police did act on the complaint. Pachaar said Udaipur ASP Jayestha Netri was investigating the case and the accused had been arrested from Ahmedabad. He said that police had recovered some pictures from the accused’s mobile phone. He said an autopsy was carried out and the body was handed over to the family. The SP said on the day of the autopsy, a report was filed by the girl’s family members. He said many people were present on that day and nothing objectionable was pointed out, but after 4-5 days, the girl’s relative accused the boy of abetment. He said based on the report, the boy was arrested from Ahmedabad. Pachaar added that they were collecting evidence to prove abetment. The accused, however, had admitted that he was in a relationship with the girl for a long time, he said. "We are also investigating the allegations against the SHO of Saira police station," Pachaar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/kin-allege-police-inaction-in-dalit-girls-suicide-case/articleshow/87049817.cms||---

Farmers said that how can they start work in the fields in the absence of the fertilizer. The agriculture department claimed that they have sent the demand order to the state government. The agriculture department decided this year to have 2 lakh hectare of sowing during the Rabi season in the district and therefore, the farmers started preparing their fields for the next crop. But the farmers alleged that there is shortage of fertilizer throughout the district and therefore they are facing problems. They also alleged that agriculture department is providing fertilizer according to their choice. On Friday, there was distribution of DAP in Kishangarh and there was a long queue outside the KVSS centre from very early in morning. There were only 600 bags of fertilizer and as soon as the distribution started, there was a ruckus at the centre and looking at the shortage, farmers staged a protest. Officials of agriculture department said that they are distributing the fertilizer according to the aadhaar cards as well as according to the land that the farmers have. There is no discrimination being done. Sources said that the district does not have fertilizer according to the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/kishangarh-farmers-stir-over-fertiliser-shortage/articleshow/87049819.cms||---

---||India||Singhu horror: Mob chops off man’s hand, lynches him; 1 held||NEW DELHI: In a gruesome incident that has cast a shadow over the farmers’ protest at Singhu border, a 35-year-old man was beaten up by a mob, allegedly led by Nihangs, his left hand chopped off and both legs broken with a blunt object early on Friday morning. After he died of his injuries, his body was tied to an overturned police barricade in a version of medieval justice even as the mob exulted over their action. The provocation was an alleged desecration of a Sikh holy book though people TOI spoke to had different versions and there was no clarity. The incident happened between 2am and 3am, and by morning, videos capturing the macabre incident at the Kundli end of the protest had started circulating. The victim has been identified as Lakhbir Singh, a labourer from Tarn Taran in Punjab. He had arrived at the protest site about a week ago and used to stay with the Nihangs and eat at the langar. One person, Sarabjeet, who was later at night brought to the police by a group of protesters, has been arrested in the case. “Following our investigation, we arrested one Sarabjeet, a Nihang Sikh. He told us that he saw Lakhbir committing sacrilege on their holy book and so he chopped off his wrist,” said DSP Hansraj. An autopsy has been conducted by a board of doctors which has confirmed the injuries on the body. Police believe many others were involved in the killing. “The severance of the wrist was not the only reason behind the death. He was beaten up brutally and lathis were used,” said an officer. They are now scanning the videos in which some people have allegedly owned up to the murder. The Kundli police had responded to a call around 5am and rushed to the spot. “The man’s wrist had been chopped off and legs broken and he was tied to a barricade. He had already died,” said a policeman who was at the spot. According to an officer, the protesters were non-cooperative and initially didn’t allow them to remove the body. Later, the cops managed to send the body to hospital. Sandeep Khirwar, ADGP Rohtak, said they have registered a case under sections 302 and 34 of IPC, pertaining to murder and collective criminal acts. Recalling the incident, farmer Balwinder Singh alleged that the man had desecrated the Sikh holy book and was caught near a makeshift hospital where people gathered and assaulted him. “Some protesters cut off his wrist but we don’t know who attacked him with swords,” he said. A Nihang Sikh said, “In a mob attack, it is very difficult to know who initiated the violence. The crowd has no face.” Another farmer said that a Nihang had found the holy book missing from a tent and raised an alarm. People began shouting “pakdo, pakdo (catch him)”. Conspiracy theories are floating in the air. Sukhbir Singh, who lives a kilometre-and-a-half away from the lynching site, said: “The man had been instigated by someone. He fled with the holy book but was caught and thrashed by the crowd. There were 200-250 people involved and I don’t know who attacked him with a sword.” Sukhbir saw the man tied to the police barricade with his wrist chopped. “He was not alive when I saw him. The police came and took away his body,” he said. Karma Singh, an elderly man, reiterated, “I saw his hands tied to the barricade. I have never before come across such a scene." In a video that later emerged on social media, which TOI can’t authenticate, some men are seen standing near the barricade to which the victim is tied. One man is heard saying, “We have caught him and chopped off his hand. We have proof that he was given money and sent here.” In another video, a person claiming responsibility for the lynching, says, “Our group carried out the killing. It should be seen as a warning that anyone desecrating our holy book will have to face the same action.” Singhu border killing: Nihang member held for brutal lynching||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/singhu-horror-mob-chops-off-mans-hand-lynches-him-1-held/articleshow/87050757.cms||Abhay Singh

IIT-Hyderabad followed, with IIT Delhi a close third, which is incidentally home to the highest number of top 10 rankers. Last year, the southern zone saw the best performance. This time around, all eyes were on Jaipur boy Mridul Agarwal, all-India rank (AIR) 1, from IIT-Delhi zone who scored 348/360, or 96.6% — a feat not achieved ever since this entrance test took the two-tier form with JEE Advanced being the deciding criteria for admission to the premier tech institutes. IIT-Delhi zone also boasts the all-India girl topper Kavya Chopra (AIR 98). A total of 41,862 students cleared JEE(A) 2021, of whom 6,452 are female. Both are set on joining the computer science programme: Mridul will join the Powai campus and Kavya will head to Delhi. Both gave credit to their families for believing in them; “being consistent” was their secret sauce for cracking JEE (A). The entrance results for the 23 IITs were announced on Friday. The qualifying aggregate marks for common rank list dropped to 63, lower than last year’s 69; the minimum percentage to the aggregate score, however, remained constant at 17.5%. The total seats have increased to 16,232 from last year’s 16,053 and 13,000 in 2019. “The criterion for qualification is such that we include candidates at least two times of the available seats in each category,” said JEE (Advanced) organising chairman Debashish Chakravarty. A general category candidate with 63 marks out of 360 is now eligible for a seat in the IITs. The qualifying aggregate marks were 69 (17.5%), 93, 90 and 128 in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The minimum qualifying marks in each subject this year is 6. “Each year is unique. One cannot compare the performance across years. When marks drop, either the questions are tougher or students did not perform up to the mark,” added Chakravarty. Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-Bombay, said this year’s performances depended a lot on the local ecosystem around students. “Most students were preparing for the entrance tests from their homes. On account of the pandemic, learning was happening online. A cooperative ecosystem at home and better online training facilities could have made a difference in some zones,” said Chaudhuri. While 77.2% of the total candidates who took the test are male, the success rate as a percentage of males who appeared is 32.4%. The number of female candidates qualifying stood at 6,452. The supernumerary seats for women across campuses have gradually increased from 14% in 2018 to 20% last year to encourage them to opt for IITs for their undergraduate studies and to address their low participation in technical education. The additional 20% additional supernumerary seats will not have any effect on the existing seats. Seven foreigners have also qualified in JEE (A), apart from 169 OCI/PIO candidates. There were more OBC candidates who took the exam this year compared with those from the general category: 51,789 (9,150 qualified) took the exam versus 40,950 (17,057 qualified) from the open category. In 2017, the total number of candidates offered a seat in the IITs was 10,576, which increased to 13,604 in 2019 and 16,061 last year.

---||India||Aim to make India world’s biggest military power: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: The seven defence public units carved out of the mammoth Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) will become a strong base for India's military strength in the years ahead, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday, urging the new entities to make research and innovation an integral part of their work culture. Under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign, the goal is to make India “the world’s biggest military power on its own” and develop a modern defence industrial base, said the PM, in a video address at an event to dedicate the seven new defence companies to the nation on the occasion of Vijayadashami. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval and the military brass, among others, attended the event. “Today, there is more transparency, trust and a technology-driven approach in the country's defence sector than ever before. For the first time after Independence, so many major reforms are taking place in our defence sector and instead of stagnant policies, a single-window system has been arranged,” the PM said, noting that the OFB reform was pending for the last 15-20 years. The OFB was dissolved on October 1, with its 41 factories, assets, employees and management being transferred to the seven new 100% government-owned companies in accordance with the Cabinet decision to corporatise the entity, as was reported by TOI. The restructuring is designed to make the seven PSUs functionally autonomous, more productive and cost-efficient as the main suppliers of arms, ammunition and clothing to the 15-lakh strong armed forces. “You (the seven companies) not only have to match the world’s biggest companies, but also take the lead in future technology… become global brands. Competitive costs are our strength, quality and reliability should also become our identity,” said Modi. The new companies, with an order book of over Rs 65,000 crore, will also play an important role in import substitution. “I will also tell start-ups that they should also be part of this new beginning that the country has started today through these seven companies,” the PM said. Citing the various reforms undertaken by the government, including the two defence industrial corridors set up in UP and Tamil Nadu, the PM said various Indian companies were now also exploring possibilities in the defence production arena. “The private sector and the government, together, are moving ahead in the mission to ensure defence of the nation. This is also creating new opportunities for the youth in the country, and opening up new possibilities for many MSMEs in the form of supply chains. As a result of the policy changes in the last five years, our defence exports have increased by more than 325%,” he added. The world had seen the strength of India's ordnance factories at the time of World War-I and II. “After Independence, we needed to upgrade these factories, adopt new-age technology. But it was not given much attention. Over time, India became dependent on foreign countries for its strategic and defence needs. These new seven defence companies will play a big role in bringing change in this situation,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aim-to-make-india-worlds-biggest-military-power-pm-modi/articleshow/87051289.cms||---

Speaking at the annual Vijayadashami event here to mark Sangh’s foundation day, Bhagwat also raised the issue of targeted killings of the minorities in Kashmir, saying terrorists were doing so to bring back the fear that had vanished in the valley after the Centre’s nullification of Article 370. In his speech, which was beamed live on the social media as the event was once again closed for mediapersons, Bhagwat pointed out that while religions like Islam and Christianity came to India through invasion, Jews and Parsis came to the country seeking refuge. The event, which was attended by Union minister Nitin Gadkari and former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, had the consul general of Israel Kobbi Shoshani as a special guest. While calling for a review and reformulation of the national population policy by keeping the next 50 years in mind, Bhagwat reiterated the 2015 resolution of RSS’s Akhil Bhartiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM) which openly talked about the rising share of Muslims and Christians in the country’s population. Referring to Muslims, he said they can follow patriots like quartermaster Abdul Hamid (who was posthumously awarded Param Vir Chakra for his heroic role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war) or Hasan Khan Mewati who fought Babur alongside Rana Sanga. The written text of Bhagwat’s speech released by the RSS includes the ABKM resolution which cites the 2011 census and says that population of religions of “Bharatiya origin” has come down from 88% to 83.8% between 1952 and 2011. The Muslim population, on the other hand, has grown from 9.8% to 14.23% during the same period. The rate of growth of Muslim population has been very high than the national average in the border states of Assam, Bengal and Bihar and this clearly indicates unabated infiltration from Bangladesh, the resolution had said. Emphasizing that “religious imbalance” in north-eastern states has assumed serious proportions, the written text of the speech quotes from the resolution: “The populations of people following indigenous religions have come down to 67% from 81.3% from 2001 to 2011. In just one decade, the Christian population has grown by 13%. In Manipur, the population of religions of Bharatiya origin has come down to 50% from more than 80%. The unnatural growth of Christian population indicates a targeted action by some groups with vested interests.” Bhagwat, who did not read out the entire resolution, advocated the need for implementing the national register of citizenship (NRC). “The NRC is however not meant for those people who have been living in India as citizens since generations,” he said. Criticising the recent incident of violence on the Assam-Mizoram border in which six jawans of Assam police were killed, Bhagwat, without naming the two northeastern states, said that they are part of the same country. Speaking on the targeted killings of minorities in Kashmir, the RSS chief said the terrorists wanted to revive fear in the valley. “This is why they (terrorists) resort to targeted killings to demoralize, like they did before. Their objective is to again instill fear.” On Taliban, Bhagwat said they claim to have changed but indications are to the contrary. “The country needs to have a cautious approach toward the new regime in Afghanistan,” he added. “Their predisposition to passionate fanaticism, tyranny and terrorism in the name of Islam is sufficient to make everyone apprehensive. Now, China, Pakistan and Turkey have coalesced in an unholy coalition with the Taliban,” Bhagwat added. The RSS chief said properties and management of Hindu temples are being usurped and handed over to heretics. “In south India, temples are being controlled by the government. In rest of the country, it’s a mixed system where temples are run by both government and trusts. The temples should be handed over to the Hindu devotees and the wealth utilized for worship of the deity and welfare of the Hindu community,” he said. He also stressed the need to regulate OTT platforms and expressed concerns over “uncontrolled” cryptocurrencies and the drug menace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bhagwat-reiterates-rss-concern-at-rising-muslim-share-in-population/articleshow/87051323.cms||---

District superintendent of police Debojit Deori told TOI, “We have taken a suo moto case in the incident against the accused as the teacher did not file any FIR. The district magistrate has already ordered an inquiry into the case.” He said, “The incident has two parts. We are not investigating the school fee issue on which the students had staged a protest. Our investigation will cover the later part of the incident where the teacher was made to kneel down in public.” He said the district deputy commissioner has already taken up the school fee issue. Meanwhile, Biraj Das, officer in-charge of Philobari police station, said charges under the Information Technology Act have also been slapped in the case. The incident took place on Monday when the teacher went to talk to the protesting students on their demands. The protest was led by the Tinsukia wing of the All Assam Students Union (an influential students’ body of Assam) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP). Video of incident went viral on social mediaKarna Burhagohain, vice-president of the Tinsukia Aasu, along with a few other students “misbehaved” with the teacher and made her kneel down in public. A video of the incident went viral on social media, which triggered massive reactions across the state. People expressed resentment at the Aasu leader engaged in such “poor behaviour” with the teacher. Sankor Jyoti Baruah, general secretary of Aasu, said the organisation has expelled Karna Burhagohain for his act with immediate effect.

India slammed the findings that found it lagging its neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, saying the “four question” survey did not include a query on whether respondents had recieved support from government schemes during the pandemic. It also pointed out the report’s incongruous conclusion that countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal improved their nutritional status, suggesting that the pandemic had no impact on them at all. In a statement on the findings, the ministry of women and child development has said that it is “shocking” to find that the report has lowered the rank of India on the basis of the Food and Agriculture Organisation estimate on proportion of undernourished population, “which is found to be devoid of ground reality and facts and suffers from serious methodological issues”. The report released on October 14 has as its publishing agencies, Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The WCD ministry states that the methodology used by FAO is “unscientific”. “They have based their assessment on the results of a ‘four question’ opinion poll, which was conducted telephonically by Gallup. The scientific measurement of undernourishment would require measurement of weight and height, whereas the methodology involved here is based on the Gallup poll based on telephonic estimate of the population,” the WCD ministry states. The ministry also goes on to say that the report “completely disregards government’s massive effort to ensure food security of the entire population during the Covid period, verifiable data on which are available. “The opinion poll does not have a single question on whether the respondent received any food support from the government or other sources. The representativeness of even this opinion poll is doubtful for India and other countries.” “It is noted with surprise that other four countries of this region – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have not been affected at all by Covid-19 pandemic induced loss of job/business and reduction in income levels, rather they have been able to improve their position on the indicator ‘proportion of undernourished population,” the WCD observes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-trashes-hunger-index-says-methodology-of-survey-unscientific/articleshow/87051569.cms||---

The two dignitaries held a wide-ranging discussion to step up bilateral cooperation during the eighth India-USA Economic and Financial Partnership meeting held here on Thursday. The meeting reflected the growing importance of the US-India relationship and the increasing economic and financial ties between the two economies. The importance of fighting illicit finance and the need for continued cooperation in tackling money laundering and combating the terror funding was underpinned by Sitharaman and Yellen, the finance ministry said in a tweet, as the two countries issued a detailed joint statement after the meeting. “We continue to strengthen our cooperation in tackling money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism through increased information sharing and coordination,” said the joint statement. “Both sides agree on the importance of fighting financial crimes and on the effective implementation of the FATF standards to protect our financial systems from abuse,” it added. It assumes importance as the Paris-based global body against money laundering and terror financing in June retained Pakistan on its ‘grey list’ for failing to check money laundering, leading to terror financing. The FATF asked Pakistan to investigate and prosecute UN-designated terrorists based in the country like Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and also asked Islamabad to work to address its strategically important deficiencies. During the first India-US Economic and Financial Partnership meeting since the onset of the pandemic, the two countries also agreed on further talks on emerging financial sectors such as cross-border payments, payment systems and the development of an International Financial Services Centre||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-us-talk-to-curb-terror-funds-finance-crime/articleshow/87051702.cms||---

In a statement, the Anjuman Auqaf Jamia Masjid also said that police personnel “forced” employees to close all gates of the mosque and no ‘namazis’ (devotees) were allowed inside. “Authorities did not allow congregational Friday prayers to be held at the Jamia Masjid Srinagar today. Heavy deployment of forces was carried out since early morning in the entire area. When Auqaf employees opened the gates of the mosque, police personnel forced them to close all gates, and no ‘namazis’ (devotees) were allowed inside the mosque for offering the obligatory Friday prayers,” the mosque’s managing body said. A large group of devotees, including women and children, who had gathered outside the mosque, strongly protested this “authoritarian move” and demanded that they be allowed to go inside the mosque to offer prayers, but to no avail, it claimed. The Anjuman said that the earlier pretext of Covid-19 pandemic by authorities to prevent Muslims from offering Friday prayers at the Jamia Masjid stood completely exposed today. “It is extremely unfortunate and disdainful of authorities to disallow Muslims of theValley from praying at the central mosque by use of brute force and cause them hurt and grief. Muslims of the Valley denounce this injustice and interference in religious freedom in strongest terms,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/historic-jk-mosque-locked-up-people-not-allowed-to-pray-admin/articleshow/87051811.cms||---

Despite that, your blessings gave me the opportunity to serve Gujarat in 2001,” the PM said after virtually laying the foundation stone for a boys’ hostel on the outskirts of Surat. “And such is the power of your blessings that even after 20 years, I am still serving. First I served the people of Gujarat and now I’m serving the country,” Modi said. He also urged people to walk on the path shown by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “Sardar Patel had said that we should not let castes and religious faith become a hindrance for us. We’re all sons and daughters of India and we should love our country. People of Gujarat always believed in strengthening his teachings,” Modi said. He also recalled the contribution of prominent reformers and educationists from Gujarat. He gave credit to some of the initiatives started during his tenure as chief minister for improvement on the education front. “There was a time when Gujarat didn’t have good quality schools and teachers. We included people in the movement and launched initiatives like Praveshotsav and Gunotsav,” Modi said. As lack of toilets at schools was leading to girls dropping out, these facilities were provided and as a result, the number of girls leaving schools midway significantly decreased, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/had-no-dynasty-or-caste-backing-but-got-the-chance-to-lead-says-modi/articleshow/87052494.cms||---
---||India||Rate of Muslim population rise fell more than Hindus’ in 20 years||While India’s Muslim population grew faster than the Hindu population between 1991 and 2001 and then between 2001 and 2011, the pace of growth declined more dramatically for Muslims than Hindus over these two decades, census data shows. Indeed, of all major religious communities in the country, the smallest decline in population growth between these two decades was in the case of Hindus while smaller groups such as Jains and Buddhists saw the sharpest drops. The 1991 census did not cover Jammu & Kashmir and therefore, growth rates have to be calculated excluding the erstwhile state, now split into two Union Territories. Excluding Jammu & Kashmir, the country’s overall population grew by 21.5% from 1991 to 2001, but by a lower 17.7% between 2001 and 2011. All religious communities contributed to this slowing down with each one seeing slower growth than in the previous decade. The decline in Hindu population growth was by 3.1 percentage points from 19.9% to 16.8%, the only major group for which the slowdown was less than the national average. Muslim population growth dropped by 4.7 percentage points from 29.3% to 24.6%, while the Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain population groups saw even larger declines. Experts agree that economic class and education levels, particularly of the mother, are the biggest determinants of fertility and hence population growth. Religion is at best a minor factor. This also explains why the population of Muslims in, say, Kerala, grew by a much smaller percentage than the population of Hindus in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rate-of-muslim-population-rise-fell-more-than-hindus-in-20-years/articleshow/87052617.cms||---
---||Business||Irdai moots premium hike for rebuilding in disaster areas||Mumbai: The insurance regulator has mooted the introduction of a differential premium for insured properties that are rebuilt on sensitive terrain after a natural disaster. This followed an observation that even industries are reconstructing in the same location after a disaster event. Highlighting the growing risk of climate change and natural catastrophe for the Indian insurance industry, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) member S N Rajeswari quoted a report that said that India was the seventh-most vulnerable country to climate change events. “Once-a-century storms are occurring annually. All the models for charging reinsurance or insurance premium are going for a toss. It will be difficult to have a common model as the situation is changing from country to country,” said Rajeswari, speaking at the annual insurance summit organised by the National Insurance Academy on Thursday. But even as weather risks were rising, the construction density in high-risk areas was increasing. “We are seeing more and more properties being built on vulnerable plains and near coastal areas. While we have improved early warnings and humans can move to other places, the houses have to be rebuilt. This is a no-win situation for the government,” she said. She said that there was lack of awareness even among large corporates. “There is a need for awareness. Even industries are built in the same place after compensation is paid. Do we mean to say that they do not have the awareness?” she said. “We should probably ask them to pay a differential premium because this is a loss to the country,” she said. According to Rajeswari, insurance — besides providing protection — also increased awareness of risks. She quoted a study by Lloyds, which said that a 1% increase in insurance coverage can reduce the global cost of climate disasters by 22%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-moots-premium-hike-for-rebuilding-in-disaster-areas/articleshow/87048948.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Sons of tea vendor, scrap dealer shine in JEE exam||AHMEDABAD/SURAT: Gujarat candidates have put up a stellar performance in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced, the results of which were announced on Friday. At least seven candidates have secured spots in the Top 100 All India Rankings (AIR). Only three candidates had achieved this feat last year. One candidate is a tea vendor’s son from Jamjodhpur — Lisen Kadiwara (AIR-57). On the highest reaches of the list from Gujarat is Naman Soni, the son of a coal trader, who stood sixth in AIR. Close to Naman is Ananth Kidambi (AIR-13). Ananth had secured the 10th position in AIR in JEE Mains earlier this year. Param Shah is 52nd. Another Gujarat candidate in Top 100 is a scrap dealer’s son. The candidates have cracked the exams studying online, a contingency forced upon them by the Covid pandemic. “This is the best ever result for Gujarat. Earlier, a large number of students from the state used to go to Kota for coaching,” said Rakesh Bothra, the owner of an Ahmedabad-based coaching class. “But this trend has seen a decline over the past few years with many good coaching classes opening up in the state.” About 6,000 candidates from the state took the JEE Advanced this year and 50 of them are in the Top 1,000 AIR. Sanjay Shrivastav, the centre head of an Ahmedabad-based coaching class, said Gujarat’s performance has been very good this year. “Earlier, only a couple of students from the state made it to the Top 100 AIR,” Shrivastav said. “The awareness has certainly increased in Gujarat and students here have both the aptitude and the attitude to crack JEE.” The results were released by IIT-Kharagpur on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jee-sons-of-tea-vendor-scrap-dealer-shine/articleshow/87048687.cms||---

Villagers started objecting to it soon after the foundation laying ceremony of the building was done on October 1. Two rooms had already been built when several complaints against the activity prompted the authorities to demand documents. “After the district magistrate's directions, we have inspected the under-construction building. We have sought the documents regarding the construction of the building and the work has been halted for now,” said SDM Rakesh Kumar. Villagers are concerned that the centre may become a hub of religious activities. Some also alleged that a madrassa is being built. Jamiat officials, however, said that the centre was for training youths for social activities. A senior member of Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, Mohammad Zaheen Madani, said, “All papers related to the centre will be produced before the administration. We have all the relevant papers.” It should be noted that years ago, Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, India’s largest Muslim outfit, had launched its youth wing at an event in Deoband. It had also announced that in the coming months, thousands of youths would be inducted into the wing named ‘Jamiat Youth Club’. During the lockdown in Muzaffarnagar, this club had launched a sanitisation drive across the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/admin-halts-construction-of-jamiat-youth-club-after-locals-object/articleshow/87047086.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Kelageri Lake, spread across 170 acres, has the distinction of having been built by none other than Sir M Visvesvaraya. HDMC initiated work on rejuvenating the lake a few years ago, and a walking path was constructed. Work is currently under way on the construction of an open-air gymnasium, and installation of electricity poles. The blueprint for the AMRUT Green Zone project was prepared in 2019, but work on the same was halted owing to Covid-19. MLA Aravind Bellad suggested a few changes to the project. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal confirmed to TOI that work on the Kelageri Lake was close to completion. “We have created amenities for children and senior citizens. We have installed electricity poles as part of the beautification of the lake. There are also plans to plant flowers around the park, and we have deployed security at the lake,” Itnal said. He added that there was a plan to develop similar amenities including a walking path and recreational facilities at Kolikeri Lake in Hosayellapur at an estimated cost of Rs 2.3 crore. “Work at the lake is under way, and will be completed in two to three months,” the HDMC commissioner said. Kelageri resident Raghuveer Siddi said, “The rejuvenated Kelageri Lake will soon turn into a haunt for people to spent their time during leisure. People should use the facilities at the lake responsibly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/twin-cities-oldest-lakes-get-a-fresh-lease-of-life/articleshow/87048327.cms||---
---||Business||Bankers see risk in chase for commercial papers||MUMBAI: Availability of cheap funds in the money markets through commercial papers is prompting financial intermediaries to arbitrage and chase higher returns. While broking firms are raising funds for funding of initial public offers (IPOs), bankers fear that the money might find a way into riskier assets. The surplus liquidity in the money market has resulted in the heightened issuance of commercial papers. The average monthly outstanding during the first half of the current financial year has been over Rs 4 lakh crore. However, according to bankers, concerns are emerging on the nature of issuers with some borrowing at high rates. Commercial papers, although debt instruments like bonds, are for very short tenures (usually three months), because of which issuers can get better ratings than they would for longer-term bonds. These are issued by corporates as well as finance companies and, in recent times, mutual funds have turned out to be major investors in this segment.The share of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in total commercial paper issuances increased to 43.2% in H1 of 2021-22 from 21.9% in the corresponding period of the previous year, while that of corporates moderated to 46.2% from 64.9% over the same period. Top-rated borrowers can raise funds at close to the reverse repo rate of 3.35%, which is the rate at which banks lend to the RBI. However, yield-chasing fund managers make small investments in high-yield papers and there have been outlier issuers at 12-13% as well. According to bankers, there is a likelihood that the availability of cheap funds might prompt some intermediaries to arbitrate with more risky investments such as stressed assets. Although companies dealing in stressed assets do not borrow directly from money markets, they can raise money through intermediaries who have access. Last month, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said that the drop in credit deposit ratio has resulted in the mispricing of credit risk by banks. “There is a temptation on the part of lenders to go down the risk curve and misprice the risk. We are starting to see this,” he said. While bank deposits rose 3.2% to Rs 156 lakh crore in FY22 up to September 24, advances grew only 0.1% to Rs 109.5 lakh crore in the same period. The RBI’s monetary policy report noted that commercial paper issuances increased to Rs 10.1 lakh crore during H1 2021-22 from Rs 7.9 lakh crore in H1FY21. Their rates were on an average 46 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) higher than the repo rate. However, the yields have risen due to increased issuances by NBFCs, partly to mobilise resources for investment in IPOs, but moderated subsequently, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bankers-see-risk-in-chase-for-commercial-papers/articleshow/87048922.cms||---

Rajkot city police said that a 38-year-old woman from Mochi Bazaar area of Rajkot lodged a complaint against Paras Bodiya (35), accusing him of raping her minor daughter twice in the past couple of months. Police said that Bodiya is married and has two children. According to the police complaint, Bodiya owns a provision store in Mochi Bazaar. The minor girl used to visit Bodiya’s store often to purchase provisions for her house. The shop owner befriended the girl and they exchanged mobile phone numbers. “Bodiya told the girl that he liked her and wanted to marry her once she becomes an adult,” police said. A few months ago, Bodiya took the girl to a guest house and allegedly raped her. A week ago, the accused came to the girl’s house when she was alone and again raped her, said police, quoting the complaint filed by the girl’s mother. After last week's incident, the girl went into depression and stopped talking to family members. When her mother asked her about her odd behaviour, the girl told her about Bodiya. “Following the revelation, the woman approached police and lodged a complaint against Bodiya who is yet to be arrested,” police said.

Muley, a sub-registrar at Haveli, Pune, who is a co-accused in Enforcement Directorate case against former minister Eknath Khadse over a Pune land purchase, was accused of connivance in registering the sale. Special public prosecutor Kavita Patil opposed his bail plea, saying it was a serious offence and that Mulay had “knowingly ignored the rights of MIDC’’ and may tamper with evidence if released. His lawyer Mohan Tekavde argued and the court accepted that “prima facie,’’ his connivance with other accused is not shown or that he connived to register the sale deed which otherwise ought not to have been registered. His non-arrest during investigation is also relevant said the court.

The SEIAA in the meeting held in September noted that one of the activities proposed by the project proponent under CER was maintenance of TS canal for which the proponent had not submitted a detailed action plan. The minutes of the meeting noted that the detailed action plan was not submitted and that project proponent reported that they had genuine problems in taking up the maintenance of TS canal. The EC for the project was issued in 2016. The total project cost is Rs 613.89 crore and one of the conditions for environmental clearance was to take up CER activities to the tune of 1% of the project cost which comes to 6.14 crore. The SEIAA observed in the latest meeting that a few CER activities costing Rs 60.55 lakh were mentioned in the environment management plan and the present stage of the implementation of these activities were not known to authority as they were not mentioned in the half yearly compliance report available in the office of the SEIAA. In the 108th meeting held in 2019, the SEIAA decided to inform the project proponent that both TS canal and Akkulam lake are ecologically and economically important assets of the state and utmost care has to be taken in maintaining/rejuvenating them. The authority also decided to inform the proponent that for the rejuvenation of both the TS canal and Akkulam lake, a detailed action plan has to be prepared in consultation with the department of Irrigation/tourism and the Thiruvananthapuram corporation. Proponent shall also consult national highway and national waterway authorities while preparing the action plan, as per the minutes of the 108th SEIAA meeting. In the absence of a detailed action plan and project proponent raising concerns in the maintenance of TS canal, the authority has directed that there shall be a complete review of the present stage of implementation of CER activities approved as per EIA/EMP and further course of action. “If there are genuine problems in taking up maintenance of TS canal, as mentioned in the EC, project proponent in consultation with the Thiruvananthapuram corporation/with local self-government institutions can propose the activities listed in office memorandum issued by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change. This has to be done on priority as five years have already lapsed,” the committee noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/project-proponent-pulls-out-from-ts-canal-maintenance/articleshow/87048658.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Pray for victory over Covid, the modern-day Ravana: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Dussehra this year was different. The most iconic event of the day, the burning of the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath, was either not done, or when done was accompanied by a compromise on the traditional rat-a-tat of firecrackers. But all the warnings went unheard with social distancing completely ignored at the various Ramlilas as were the instructions to wear face masks. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal attended the Lav Kush Ramlila Committee's iteration of the Ramayana enactment on Dussehra day on Friday and shot the arrow that sparked Ravana’s dahan, or burning. Kejriwal reached the stage atop an excavator. Addressing the crowd, the Delhi CM set the gathering alight by shouting, “Jai Shri Ram.” Then he carried on, “I have been coming to this Ramlila and it has always been packed. Today, I see fewer people due to the coronavirus.” Kejriwal reminded the people that everyone had seen the Ramlila performance earlier and knew how Lord Rama had killed Ravana. He added, “It is not the killing of any person. It is, in many ways, the victory of dharma over adharma and the destruction of adharma. We have read in the Gita that whenever adharma increases, then god destroys adharma in his own way.” He exhorted people to abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour to check the spread of the pandemic. “On this auspicious occasion, I pray to Lord Ram to free our entire country of the coronavirus, which is a form of Ravana,” he said.  “It has been almost two years now that we are battling this disease. If we all pray together, then our collective prayer will have a great effect. I pray to God that everyone in our country remains healthy and diseases get destroyed. May all of us and our households receive god’s blessings, and may we be blessed with lots of happiness.” The organising members of the Luv Kush Ramlila were apologetic about the scaled-down celebrations this year. In earlier years, they asserted, they had effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnath measuring 150-200 feet and they were filled with firecrackers that went off when the towering figures were set afire.  Due to the rising pollution and the pandemic, the effigies this year were only 30 feet high and in the absence of real crackers, the organisers had to make do with the sound effect of digital crackers. While the Ram Lila function at Kashmere Gate also had to be content without the traditional dahan ceremony, the one organised at Indraprastha had a technological compromise on the effigy burning. The committee opted for a digital event watched by a far smaller crowd than usual after attendance was restricted by the authorities. “We have been carrying out the Ramlila for 25 years, but owing to the pandemic and the air pollution, this year we had to do without the effigy burning,” said Pramod Aggarwal, treasurer, Ram Lila Indraprastha. Two large LED screens were set up for the people who gathered to watch the proceeding without being able to enter the main venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-pray-for-victory-over-covid-the-modern-day-ravana/articleshow/87050650.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Durga Puja celebrations quieter, smaller; idol immersion ends without much ado||NEW DELHI: For the second year in a row, Durga Puja celebrations in the city were subdued due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A large number of Durga Puja organisers, including many in Chittaranjan Park, opted for a ghat puja (holy vessel) instead of immersion and where idols were installed, these were smaller than the traditional 10-15 feet tall ones. This year, as in 2020, immersion in any waterbody or public place wasn’t allowed and most puja samitis immersed the idols in artificial tanks and makeshift ponds with a limited number of people taking part in the event on Friday. Immersion in the Yamuna has been prohibited since 2019. Abhijit Bose, chairman of the Aram Bagh Puja Samiti, said, “Due to Covid, we had to shift the venue of the Durga Puja to a temple, but the immersion was carried out in the old venue in a park. A 10x5 feet pond was created with tarpaulin sheets. The ornaments and other remnants were later given back to the Uttam Nagar-based idol maker while the flowers were given to an NGO.” At Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir, Prodip Ganguly, managing committee member, said that like every year, the immersion took place in a tank within the temple premises.  He noted that while in 2020 the Pratima Puja was live streamed, this year visitors were allowed in after ensuring there was no crowding despite the huge number of people turning up at the temple. It was a similar day with the immersion in a pond in a park at D Block, Chittaranjan Park. “This year marked the silver jubilee of our puja samiti and we pray that there is no Covid when we celebrate Durga Puja next year,” said Sujoy Ghosh, general secretary of the Sarbojanin Puja Samiti there.  Ghosh disclosed that during the three-day celebrations, only fully vaccinated people were allowed into the venue, that too after screening. Amitava Dutta, secretary, Kali Bari Mayur Vihar Samiti, happily informed that the idols of 12 Durga Puja committees were immersed in an artificial tank in the temple premises. He said the immersions were conducted by the Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella body of puja committees of east Delhi, with the help of district authorities. “In east Delhi, two areas were identified at the Kali Bari in Mayur Vihar Phase I and Purbasha Kali Bari in IP Extension for the immersion of 11 idols,” Dutta said. “There was no crowding during the immersion as not more than five people from each puja committee was allowed.” Dutta said that district officials kept a strict watch during the entire event to ensure all Covid and safety protocols were followed diligently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/durga-puja-celebrations-quieter-smaller-idol-immersion-ends-without-much-ado/articleshow/87050686.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||India||To counter BJP, Cong to train workers on ‘true nationalism’||NEW DELHI: Congress will soon be training its workers on the subject of “nationalism”, in an attempt to position them strongly to counter rival BJP, which it believes has made the issue its leitmotif to polarise voters. After nearly seven years of the advent of the Modi regime during which BJP has successfully melded the plank of “nationalism” and “Hindutva” to pose a tricky challenge to the “secular” bloc, Congress has decided that it has to intellectually ground its workers on patriotism, but with an ideological twist. The module of training finalised for the party cadres is “true nationalism” and they will also be taught about “The struggle for the idea of India“ and “Congress ideology“. Clearly, the Congress plan is that the workers should arm themselves with ways to counter the dominant narrative of the ruling class headed by the RSS, by learning that the patriotism peddled by the rival is different from what Congress and others believe in — “true nationalism”. That the contending Hindutva ideology has triggered a “struggle for the idea of India”, as per the AICC training module, suggests that Congress wants its workers to imbibe that the party believes in an inclusive society where patriotism is not dictated by faith. While the opposition party has vocally countered BJP over the years by accusing it of playing majoritarian politics and using nationalism as a cover, the decision to formally coach the cadres on the subject reflects a concern that the present narrative may sway them from the party ideology or weaken their belief. As per the plan, Congress will train five “trainers“ from each state and Union Territory, who would then be responsible for holding workshops for office bearers, workers and sympathisers in their jurisdictions. Crucially, Congress is going to hold these training sessions for the “trainers” in Sevagram in Wardha, which is associated with Mahatma Gandhi. Sources said the training will be completed by November after which the trainers will be sent to their states to follow up on the plan. All the states have been asked to send names to the AICC of experienced party workers to be nominated as “trainers”. While the idea of ideological training on “nationalism” has been in the works for sometime now, it comes right in the middle of yet another debate on “nationalism“ through the controversy over Savarkar. The BJP brass recently said that Savarkar apologised to the British and filed a mercy petition at the instance of Mahatma Gandhi, a claim that has elicited a strong counter from experts as well as Congress and the Left. Interestingly, other Congress allies have chosen to stay mum on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-counter-bjp-cong-to-train-workers-on-true-nationalism/articleshow/87052648.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Goa||India win SAFF Championship with 3-0 win against Nepal||Igor Stimac watched from the stands as India won the first trophy of his tenure with a convincing 3-0 against Nepal in the final of the SAFF Championship at the National Stadium in Male on Saturday. Stimac was suspended for the final, but won’t mind what he saw on the field. India won three matches in a row for the first time under him in over two years. They also scored three goals for the first time in successive games. Even though the victory was on expected lines – thanks to the 60 spots that separate the two teams – this will provide some breathing space to the under-fire Croatian coach. After a barren first session that saw little that could separate the two teams, Sunil Chhetri scored his fifth goal of the tournament, and 80th overall, to equal Argentina great Lionel Messi’s international goals record. Within a minute of Chhetri’s goal in the 49th minute, his Bengaluru FC teammate Suresh Singh made it 2-0. Then, with just a minute left on the clock, Sahal Abdul Samad worked his magic to complete the rout. “To come here as the dominant side and win the trophy makes you feel good,” said Chhetri, who finished as the top-scorer. “All this wasn’t easy. The final wasn’t easy. A lot of youngsters did well and that’s what makes me really happy.” India have now won the SAFF Championship for a record eight times in 13 editions. It didn’t start well, though, for India with draws against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Even in the final, Nepal looked determined to create an upset and win the trophy for the first time. They looked different from the group stage clash that saw them defend deep and soak the pressure. This time, they kept pushing forward. Continuous rains meant the ground conditions weren’t favourable. Players slipped, many ended up with mis-passes. Even the normally-reliable Gurpreet Singh Sandhu had it tough, though he wasn’t really stretched in the first 45 minutes. India turned the match on its head after the change of ends with two goals in as many minutes. It was Chhetri who provided the breakthrough as he darted inside the box to head home a Pritam Kotal delivery from inside the box. A minute later, Suresh added his name to the scoresheet, giving finishing touches to an excellent cut-back from Mohammed Yasir. Nepal made a triple substitution close to the hour mark, but India were always in control. Rohit Chand’s header from a freekick that struck the upright was the closest they got. India though were not yet done and got their third goal in the dying minute. It came from the boots of Sahal, whose talent is undeniable but hasn’t really delivered on the big stage. This time, Sahal showed why everyone speaks highly of him as he skipped past three defenders inside the box to calmly slot the ball into the back of the net, with his weaker right foot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-win-saff-championship-with-3-0-win-against-nepal/articleshow/87070542.cms||---
---||Agra||Waterlogged roads turn disease breeding grounds, villagers go bald in protest after 8 kids die||Agra: For years, those living in Dhanoli and surrounding villages of Agra demanded that their basic amenities be in order — waterlogged roads, potholes, overflowing drains. In response, quick fixes were patched up, just enough to hold things together for a while. That was three years ago. But what started as a "development" problem turned serious last month — eight children died of viral fever and dengue. Locals believe it was because of the unhygienic state of their roads. On Wednesday, in a symbolic move, 12 men from these villages shaved their heads to protest against what they call “government apathy.” “We will boycott the assembly polls if our problems are not resolved,” Anjesh Giri, a protester from Dhanoli, said. “We have discussed our problems with the district administration over and over. Before staging this protest, we submitted a memorandum to the office of the district magistrate. But no one heard us.” So, around 10am on Wednesday, along the Dhanoli road, the villagers launched an indefinite strike. Men from the 15 affected villages, 12 of them, shaved their heads and immersed their hair in the waterlogged Dhanoli road. Some protesters sat in the middle of the road — inundated as far as one could see — while others gathered under a tent that had been set up for the “mundan”. The villages of Dhanoli, Sirauli, Azizpur and the 12 others are home to about 20,000 people. “Last year, we staged a protest demanding a change. All we want is sanitation, hygiene. The local authorities had promised us they would resolve the waterlogging problem. Elected representatives, too, turned a blind eye. Eight children died of viral fever and dengue over the past month here. It was because of the lack of cleanliness and the authority’s negligence,” said Savitri Chahar, a local activist who organised the protest. “We won’t give up until the administration takes action.” Asked about the protest, chief development officer Bhimji Upadhyaya said a solution is being “planned”. He added, “We are working to solve the problem of waterlogging on Dhanoli road permanently. Work on the road and drainage will be done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/waterlogged-roads-turn-disease-breeding-grounds-villagers-go-bald-in-protest-after-8-kids-die/articleshow/87047175.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid cases dipped 23% in October from last 2 weeks of September||MUMBAI: Maharashtra reported a drop of nearly 23% in Covid cases in the first two weeks of October as compared to the last two weeks of September. Mumbai reported a 5% surge in cases during the same period. Maharashtra reported 2,149 cases and 29 deaths on Friday, taking the total cases reported so far this month to 36,757 and 667 deaths. Between September 16 and 30, the state counted 47,921 cases and 790 deaths. Maharashtra has reported under 2,500 cases for the last seven consecutive days. Nagpur city did not report a single Covid-19 case or death on Friday, said state officials. The daily caseload in Mumbai dropped to 480 from 558 reported on Thursday, while the test positivity rate also fell to 1.2% from 1.47% in the same period. The city has reported 7,067 cases and 67 deaths this month so far as compared to 6,701 cases and 73 deaths in the last two weeks of September. Active Covid cases in both Mumbai (6,255) and state (29,782) registered an increase on Friday, but officials said the majority of the cases are asymptomatic. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force, said that despite the increase in cases in Mumbai as compared to August, hospitals are not overwhelmed with patients. “The rise is marginal so far, and if people observe Covid-appropriate behaviour, it will not worsen,” he added. The BMC dashboard on Friday showed 5,317 active patients—2,818 were stable and asymptomatic, 2,153 were stable but symptomatic, and 346 were critical. Government officials said that with the drop in Covid-19 cases in the state people were seen violating Covid norms. “People, both in urban and rural areas, are seen moving in public places without wearing a mask. Also unnecessary travel has been noticed and mass events are being held without maintaining safe distance,” said an official, requesting anonymity. He also complained that ensuring implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour by fining people or creating awareness has taken a backseat in most districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cases-dipped-23-in-oct-from-last-2-wks-of-sept/articleshow/87050713.cms||---
---||Agra||Overcrowding in UP's Firozabad district jail: 1,850 lodged in space meant for 850||AGRA: Overcrowding in Uttar Pradesh's Firozabad district jail has assumed alarming proportions, prompting authorities to shift inmates to Agra central and other jails. According to prison authorities, the district jail has been housing more inmates than its capacity. In 14 barracks, instead of 850, around 1,850 inmates are lodged. So far, 98 undertrials have been shifted to Agra Central Jail and 20 to nearby prisons. Family members claim they have no idea as to where the inmates have been shifted. A Firozabad district jail official said, “Overcrowding of prisoners is resulting in suffocation inside the barracks. Some of the prisoners have complained of health issues. With a limited number of jail warders and other staff, it is difficult to take care of so many prisoners." Brother of an undertrial accused of drug possession, who wished not to be named, said, “I went to see my younger brother in the district jail on Friday. He was there for the past four months. But, I was told that he has been shifted. The jail authorities asked me to come tomorrow to know his whereabouts." Superintendent of Firozabad district jail, Anil Kumar Rai, said, “As of now, 1,850 prisoners are kept in the district jail which is twice the total capacity of the 14 barracks. Over 100 prisoners have been sent to other districts. Their families have been informed.” The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows that Uttar Pradesh jails reported one of the most overcrowding among states in 2019, at 167.9%, second only to Delhi (174.9%). Against a capacity of 60,340, UP’s prisons were holding 1,01,297, according to the report. Several jails in the state are reportedly full "four times their capacity". In Moradabad for instance, the district jail has a capacity of 717. But, it holds 3,300 inmates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/overcrowding-in-ups-firozabad-district-jail-1850-lodged-in-space-meant-for-850/articleshow/87047181.cms||Deepak Lavania

The accused were identified as Nikhil, 19, of Pulippara near Kadakkal and Muhammed Irfan, 19, of Mukundasseri. The police said the victim in the case was a girl whom the two accused befriended through the social media app Instagram. The police launched a probe after the girl's parents called them on Thursday midnight and complained that she was missing from home. The police later found the girl from Theriyil near Palode. The girl told them that the two accused took her out of home secretly on Thursday night. They allegedly took her to a school building nearby and sexually exploited her. Later, they dropped her at Elavupalam and fled. The police traced the accused using the phone number from which they contacted the girl and they were taken into custody. The arrest was recorded by a team led by Palode station house officer inspector C K Manoj under the supervision of Nedumangad ASP Raj Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-held-for-raping-minor/articleshow/87048705.cms||---
---||Goa||Relief for yachting body after revenue min’s intervention||Panaji: After obtaining a stay on the deputy collector’s order and dodging the risk of being evicted, Goa Yachting Association said that it can now focus on the functioning of the sailing body and building more sailing champions. Goa Yachting Association (GYA) said that revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate came to its rescue by issuing a stay on a recent order of deputy collector Gurudas Desai. On September 21, TOI had reported that Monserrate has ordered a status quo after the deputy collector upheld the river navigation department’s ownership of a plot of land in Dona Paula that has been subject of a four decade-long tussle. On June 24, the deputy collector had rejected GYA’s claim on the land, which is approximately 250 sqm. “The association was successful in safeguarding its premises by filing a revision application before the revenue department and obtaining as stay on the order of the deputy collector. We can now again focus on the functioning of GYA and the sport of sailing to build more champions for the state and the country,” said president of Goa Yachting Association Siddharth Satardekar. Satardekar said that if Dessai’s order had been implemented it could have been a massive blow to one of Goa’s oldest sports associations. GYA claims that in 1974, the association had been allotted two properties in Dona Paula, but the association’s name does not reflect in the official revenue records.  In his order delivered in June this year, Desai upheld a 1989 verdict that said that the land belonged to the River Navigation Department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/relief-for-yachting-body-after-revenue-mins-intervention/articleshow/87050715.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Connaught Place cleared of illegal vendors||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police, along with officials of the enforcement department of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), jointly carried out a drive against encroachments on Connaught Place (CP) on Wednesday and Thursday. NEW DELHIThe drive was carried out after the high court asked the officials to remove all encroachments since CP was a no-vending zone. According to police officials, around 50 vendors were removed during the drive, which is going to continue for the coming days. New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) had filed a petition in the high court following which the court had stated that CP is a no-vending zone and that the corridors are meant for walking and not illegal hawkers or vendors. The court also asked the civic bodies involved to take necessary steps in order to remove such encroachments. On Wednesday and Thursday, NDMC and Delhi Police officials carried out a drive and removed all the encroachments. Unaware of the situation, many of the vendors ran after picking up their belongings, while the items of the others who could not pick them up were seized. “The drive against unauthorised vendors was conducted around Inner Circle, Outer Circle and Palika Bazar of Connaught Place by the local police along with NDMC. Fifty unauthorised vendors have been removed during this drive. The drive is going to continue,” said a senior police officer. Speaking to TOI, Atul Bhargava, president, NDTA, said, “I am not against anyone’s livelihood, but the corridors are meant for walking and instead they are crowded because people have set up illegal shops and hawkers are all over the place. We need to set an example and not tolerate this. There is even an open food sale and hawkers take over the space and squat in the corridors. Alternative arrangements should be made at a park or anywhere for the hawkers to sustain their livelihood. Currently, CP has 63 verified hawkers while there must be around 250 people illegally occupying that space. The space is designated for people to walk around and it must be used liked that.” TOI also spoke to NDMC officials, who stated that they are complying with the directions of the high court and will continue to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/connaught-place-cleared-of-illegal-vendors/articleshow/87050762.cms||---

Initially, police thought it as a case of accident death. Later, probe found that the accused had bludgeoned the victim to death and left him at a canal by the road near his scooter to make it look like an accident. The arrested are Eldhose alias Kochappa (27), his father Joy (58) and mother Molly (55) of Pindimana near Kothamangalam. The accused allegedly murdered the victim, Eldhose, who ran a photo studio at Chelad. The victim had given Kochappa Rs 3 lakh as loan. He had been demanding it back and Kochappa invited him home on the pretext of settling the deal on Sunday night. Police said the father-son duo bludgeoned him to death using the handle of an axe. The duo then took the body on the victim’s scooter to a nearby canal. Both the scooter and the body were pushed into the canal to make it look like an accident. The mother then burnt the handle of the axe used for the alleged murder into ashes. She also smashed the mobile phone of the victim. The postmortem report had revealed that the injury was caused by blunt force. The missing mobile phone also made the police expand their investigation. Later, police found from the victim’s family that he had told them about going to Kochappa’s house to settle the deal. This led the sleuths to the house where the crime happened. The last tower location where the victim’s phone was active was also in this area. The accused, however, claimed that the victim came to their house and returned Rs 2.25 lakh that they had paid him. Police, however, found out the remains of the burnt axe and smashed mobile phone. The investigation and the arrest was carried out by a special investigation team formed by the district police chief (Ernakulam rural) SP K Karthick. DSP Muhammed Riyas, inspectors Basil Thomas, Noble Manual, K J Peter and sub-inspector Mahin Salim were part of the team. Couple held for chain snatching: Njarackal police arrested a couple on Friday for snatching a gold chain weighing nearly 2.5 sovereigns from a woman. The incident happened at Pallipalam near Nedungad on October 2 when the woman was on her way to church. The accused, Sujith Kumar (35), followed the woman on the scooter and his wife, Vidya (29), who was riding pillion, snatched the gold chain from her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/3-member-family-held-for-bludgeoning-man-to-death/articleshow/87047206.cms||---

In order to reduce the dependence on normally-used varieties like ‘Jaya’ and ‘Jyoti’, the agriculture department has decided to introduce ‘black rice’ variety to Goan farmers who can cultivate this paddy variety and get high yield. Under the supervision of zonal agriculture officer Sampati Dhargalkar, assistant agriculture officer Rudresh Kambli has undertaken cultivation of the 'black rice' variety on zonal agriculture farm at Duler wherein two kgs of seeds of black rice have been sown on an area of 2,000 sqm using the system of rice intensification (SRI) method. The cultivation of black rice can give high yield, that is 7-8 kgs of seeds cultivated on an area of one acre can give yield of 10-15 kgs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/agro-dept-urges-ryots-to-grow-black-rice/articleshow/87050738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kochi: Nine SWTD boats to have GPS facility||KOCHI: To shore up tourism, Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA) has decided to install global positioning system (GPS) in nine state water transport department (SWTD) ferry boats operating in Kochi. Once installed, passengers can know the schedule of the boats, track movement and book tickets online. KMTA authorities had already held discussion regarding this with SWTD. The move is part of the Kochi open mobility network programme launched in July this year. GPS will be installed on boats operating on Ernakulam-Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, Vyttila-Kakkanad, Ernakulam-Mulavukad and Varapuzha sector. KMTA will add all details regarding the journey of the boats in the existing ‘Yatri’ application, which is used for taxi booking in Kochi. “On the application, one needs to open a journey planner by clicking on the folder ‘boats’. All the details, including schedule, time, movement and ticket fare will be available on it. We plan to extend the online boat ticket booking facility for all ferry boats in the state,” said a KMTA official. Once the application starts operational, only the boat which is scheduled to start its journey at a particular time should operate. Otherwise, it will cause disruption in the system. Currently, one can operate any boat at the scheduled time depending on the availability of the fuel in the boat, the official added. The hindrance raised at the meeting was on the remittance of fare. Currently, ticket fare collected is remitted at the treasury account. When the online ticket booking facility starts, a bank should function as a mediator to collect the money from the customer. Later, the amount should be transferred to the treasury account from the bank. It has been decided to give a 24-hour interval before transferring the amount from bank to treasury to facilitate the return of the amount to the account of the customer if he or she cancels the ticket. “This has to be discussed with the finance department before taking a final decision. KMTA has said they were ready to provide an online application facility to our ferry service across the state. Initially, it will be available in Kochi on a trial basis,” said an SWTD official. Shaji V Nair, director of the water transport department, said the discussion on online facilities is in the initial stage. “We will give a proposal regarding that to the state government, which should give a final decision,” he said. The nine ferries of the department have been witnessing footfall of around 8,000 to 10,000 passengers on holidays in the post pandemic period. It is around 5,000 on normal days. The third catamaran will join the fleet of ferry boats of the department next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nine-swtd-boats-to-have-gps-facility/articleshow/87047189.cms||T C Sreemol

With these five new records, Goa now represents 235 species of lichens. Lichen is a very small grey or yellow plant that spreads over the surface of rocks, walls and trees and does not have any flowers. A research published by Horizon e-publishing group revealed that Porina exserta, Porina siamensis, Pyrenula dissimulans, Pyrenula pyrenastrospora and Pyrenula rinodinospora are the new additions to Goa's lichen checklist. “Porina exserta, Pyrenula pyrenastrospora and Pyrenula rinodinospora were found on the bark of trees in Cotigao wildlife sanctuary. Previously, Pyrenula pyrenastrospora and Pyrenula rinodinospora were known to be from Papua New Guinea,” Pallavi told TOI, adding, “while Porina exserta was known from Thailand, Christmas Island, the Northern Territory, eastern Queensland, Taiwan and Tahi.” “Porina siamensis was found growing on an open, exposed rock in Cotigao. This species was known from Thailand. On the other hand, Pyrenula dissimulans species was found growing on a tree bark in the Goa University campus. Earlier, this was known from North and South America,” Pallavi informed. She further said that the semi-evergreen forest in Goa exhibits maximum diversity of pyrenocarpous species, which is second dominant species in Goa. “The occurrence of pyrenocarpous lichens indicates the abundant presence of smooth-barked trees in the state.” Pallavi said the present study indicates the occurrence of a rich diversity of pyrenocarpous lichens in the protected areas within Goa. Cotigao wildlife sanctuary represents more number of pyrenocarpous lichens. “Further, along with the forest areas within Goa, the coconut, arecanut orchards and several cultivated plants also provide suitable habitats for lichen growth,” she said. Pallavi is originally from Maharashtra. She shifted to Goa in 2013 and initiated her study in the lichenological field in 2014 under the mentorship of Malapati K Janarthanam, senior professor in Goa University. She has submitted seven research papers on lichens since 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/5-lichen-species-recorded-in-goa-new-to-india/articleshow/87050756.cms||---

Not only did his family face financial problems due to Covid-19, the task was uphill given that he ranked at 936th position in the JEE Main exams. “I knew from my JEE Main results that I had to work a lot harder. The times were challenging as my father was facing a financial crisis and had to borrow money from banks to fund the education of me and my sister. The tea stall he runs in Jamjodhpur had close due to Covid-19,” said Kadiwara. He studied in Gujarati medium in Jamjodhpur till Class 4, before switching to English medium. For this, he had to commute 30km every day. His father ran a small tea stall and took orders over the phone and delivered tea to shops in the area. His mother is a primary school teacher and his elder sister, Madhvi, is a computer science engineer. Lisen has a sound academic track record, having scored 97% in his Class 10 and 90% in Class 12. Kadiwara moved to Ahmedabad when he was in Class 11 for his education. His maternal uncle supported him in Ahmedabad. “My family have been a great support to me.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||New bridge and road opened at Peringamala||Thiruvananthapuram: For over 200 families living in tribal settlements of Vittikavu and Kidarakuzhi in Peringamala panchayat, connectivity has always remained a distant dream. The new bridge and road over the Idinjar-Kidarakuzhi river which was inaugurated on Thursday is a realization of the long pending demand of the residents. The bridge is going to benefit people living in Idinjar, Vittikavu and Kidarakuzhi. The new bridge helps them to connect with Idinjar town, which is the only nearby town. The people of these two villages had a difficult time before the bridge was built. Crossing the river during the rainy season as the water level rises was really difficult, as they had to wait for it to recede before crossing. With a new road and bridge, now they can cross the river without any difficulty. “Being a resident of this area, we had a difficult time over these years. We were not able to cross the river during the rain and wild animals have always been a nightmare for us. Most of the people live by the profit from farming that too will be destroyed by the wild animals, including elephant, boar, bison and sambar deer. Another village, Venkatamood is still in misery, they have to cross eight streams to reach the town. No action has been taken till now,” said Bhasurangi C, ward member of Idinjar. The minister for welfare of scheduled caste-scheduled tribe and backward classes K Radhakrishnan on Thursday inaugurated the new bridge. The minister said that steps will be taken to ensure hassle free education of tribal students and that the government will provide a job to one individual from each of the families. The minister awarded the gold medal to students who excelled in the SSLC exams. MLA D K Murali, district panchayath president D Sureshkumar, Vamanapuram block panchayat president G Komalam, and Vittikavu-Kidarakuzhi tribal village heads were among those who attended the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-bridge-and-road-opened-at-peringamala/articleshow/87048768.cms||---
---||Goa||Edu, health, transport top Cong manifesto public meet||Panaji: From intra-state rail transport to a dedicated Goa cadre of civil service officers, Congress’ open house session at Adarsh Hall, Margao, to draft a people’s manifesto, saw several suggestions put forth by party functionaries and Congress sympathisers. The inputs were largely people-centric and All India Congress Committee (AICC) senior election observer and strategist for Goa P Chidambaram said the suggestions would be used to formulate a “progressive, technology-driven and people centric” manifesto for the upcoming state assembly elections. Many speakers flagged Goa’s poor public transport system and called for a better public bus sevice. They also suggested an intra-state railway service to permit people to travel from Canacona to Pernem. Real estate developer Datta Damodar Naik recommended that Goa needs a dedicated IAS cadre. Further, he urged for Section 16B of the Town and Country Planning Act to be scrapped as it is “a source of corruption and a loophole to convert eco-sensitive land.” Revival of agriculture, stimulation of industrial growth, greater opportunities for self-employment, better public health and education infrastructure were the other aspects that speakers mentioned. Chidambaram said that Congress’ manifesto would be prepared based on the inputs provided by locals. “People must give their views and suggestions to draft the manifesto. All political parties must reflect the concerns of the people. This is the only way democracy can flourish,” said Chidambaram while speaking at the open house session. He promised that the process of seeking inputs from people would be repeated every two years so that people’s aspirations are addressed. “Manifesto is not a one-time exercise. After we will be in government, two years later, we will come back to the people and ask for more suggestions,” the former union finance minister said. However, Chidambaram said the manifesto could be implemented only if Congress got a full majority in the 2022 assembly elections. “It is absolutely necessary that Congress gets the majority in the next elections. A government formed with majority can do many things,” he said. Goa Congress had also recently stated that it will draw inspiration from a vision document compiled by former Director General of the Council for Science and Industrial Research Dr Raghunath Mashelkar, to draft its manifesto for the 2022 state assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edu-health-transport-top-cong-manifesto-public-meet/articleshow/87050792.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Amritsar||Singhu killing: Punish culprits, says SKM||BATHINDA: The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Friday condemned the killing of a farmer at Singhu border protest site and demanded that the culprits be punished as per law after investigation.  Nevertheless, it also tried to disassociate itself from the deceased and Nihang group which has claimed responsibility for the murder, saying they had no relation with the farm front. “The Morcha is against sacrilege of any religious text or symbol, but that does not give anyone the right to take the law into their own hands. We demand that the culprits be punished according to law after investigating the allegation of murder and conspiracy behind sacrilege,” said the SKM in a statement, issued by its top leaders. Lakhbir Singh (35) from Cheema Kalan village in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district, was lynched at the Singhu border on Friday morning. A Nihang group at the scene has claimed responsibility, saying that the incident took place because of the deceased’s attempt to commit sacrilege with regard to the ‘Sarbaloh Granth’. It was also said that the deceased had been staying with the same group of Nihangs for some days. Speaking to media persons on Friday, farm leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal said, “We have no connection with any of the parties as farmers are here only to fight against the three central farm laws. It seems to be a deep-rooted conspiracy, hatched by central agencies, and needs to be investigated thoroughly. If there was any act of sacrilege, it is condemnable. But the manner in which the man has been killed is highly condemnable. We want the government to hold investigation to expose the guilty as we have heard that 20 persons have been paid Rs 30,000 each and sent to farm protest sites to cause disturbances.” About the presence of Nihangs at farm protests, he said as farmers have different ideologies, people from different faiths — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Nihangs — have joined their protests. “Hindus brought here kanwar yatra and farmers welcomed them; Muslims broke their rozas (fast) here and so are Nihangs sitting here,” he said. Asked about holding talks with Nihangs, another farm leader Ruldu Singh Mansa said like farmers, they (Nihangs) also have organisations. “Let it come out which organisation these persons belong to and it will be done,” he said. To a pointed query on why the victim was not provided any medical aid or taken to hospital, Dallewal said, “Everything is being investigated. The Nihangs claimed that it was a sacrilege issue, so the volunteers were dissuaded (from helping the victim)... now CCTV footage will be collected to ascertain whether claims made by Nihangs are true or not.” Asked whether Nihangs would be asked to vacate the place, Dallewal said discussions will be held with Sikh and Nihang organisations in the coming days and decision taken thereafter. In a video message, one of the SKM leaders Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India claimed that the Nihang group had been at the protest site despite the farmers leaders’ request to them to leave it on the ground that the place was meant for only farmers’ movement and not for any religious movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/singhu-killing-punish-culprits-says-skm/articleshow/87051472.cms||Neel Kamal

Currently, there are at least seven startups operating in EV or automotive segments. “In the lot of 16 startups we have for August, four are almost EV, which means 30% of the applicants are from EV segment. It is a considerable number,” said Maker Village CEO Nizamuddin Mohammed. According to Mohammed, there is a trend of EV startups happening now. “One reason could be the increasing fuel prices and second, the markets and particularly our roads are getting ready to adopt the electric vehicle technology. From the consumer side also, there is a lot of interest in what these electric vehicles can offer. Then there are the big players like Ola Electric coming into play, so there is a strong push from that side too,” he said. Though these startups all work in the EV space, they are focusing on different aspects. “Some are preparing the actual small bikes and some are going to the bigger level also. Then, there is interest in small Segway-kind-of bikes too. Also, there are startups which are focusing on different aspects of the vehicle itself how to improve the battery, increase the life of it and how to improve the drive conditions of the vehicle,” Mohammed said. One of the startups being incubated at Maker Village, Autogrid Mobility Pvt Ltd, is coming up with a platform that aims to deliver mobile SDKs, scalable cloud infrastructure and modular hardware for developing connected mobility products and solutions. And it helps firms in analysing the driving patterns, road conditions etc. On the other hand, Transight Systems Pvt Ltd is working on vehicle tracking and IoT solutions for automobiles. Another player in EV space, Entuple E-Mobility, is focusing its resources and time on the development of chargers and motor controllers for electric vehicle applications. Astro, another startup set up by Vishnu S and Abhijith A, is engaged in the development of electric bikes, both low-cost and performance bikes. “Our target is to develop bikes, which could be fast-charged and could give the maximum range,” said founder Vishnu, an alumnus of Mount Zion College of Engineering, Pathanamthitta. “Most of the bikes in the market are belt-driven, but we are trying to manufacture bikes that are gear-driven,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maker-village-sees-more-startups-in-ev-segment/articleshow/87047232.cms||Shenoy Karun

Musthafa, a resident of Koteshwara in Kundapur, told police that his wife Amreen had delivered a ‘baby girl’ at the hospital on September 27. In his complaint at Mangaluru North police, Musthafa alleged the hospital kept the baby in ICU for 17 days and on Thursday handed over a baby boy, instead of a girl during discharge. “The hospital staff had told us that my wife had given birth to a baby girl. The child was shifted to the NICU as it was not healthy. Later, on Thursday, they handed over a baby boy to us,” Musthafa said. City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar confirming the complaint, told reporters that the complainant and others found it suspicious when the hospital handed over a male baby. “They have filed a complaint and health department officials have been verifying documents. They will also see other options like DNA and other tests. A final decision will be taken only after the verification of all documents. If they find that the baby was exchanged, we will take appropriate action. So far, we have not moved any legal procedures,” he added. Dr Durgaprasad MR, medical superintendent, Lady Goschen Government hospital, told TOI that the baby born to Amreen was a boy and not a girl. He also denied any possibilities of the baby being exchanged as alleged. “The sex of the baby was wrongly written in the case sheet as female, instead of male, and this has created confusion. We have been conducting an inquiry and action will be taken against those responsible for the error,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/newborn-girl-becomes-boy-after-discharge-dad-files-plaint/articleshow/87047267.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 45,000 cops to be promoted as naik post is scrapped||MUMBAI: In a move that will help 45,000 police personnel get promoted and increase investigating officers in the force, the state government decided to abolish the post of naik. This will remove a step in the promotion process from a constable to a sub-inspector and allow those at the lowest rung to retire at a higher grade. Officials said this will be motivating for constabulary and increase investigating officials as naiks were not allowed to investigate crimes. “This revamping of the system will recharge batteries of the investigating wing, as it will bring in more head constables and assistant sub-inspectors as investigating officers in the early stages of their careers,” said a senior official. This will increase man-days for crime investigation from 23.29 crore to 66.75 crore. Days. This is 2.8 times of current man-days. The decision was taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “This will boost the morale of the force and is a gift to the police on Vijaydashmi,” tweeted Thackeray. The proposal was worked out by state director general of police Sanjay Pande and home minister Dilip Walse Patil. A high-powered committee led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte endorsed it. Earlier, a constable got promoted to the post of naik after 10 years of service and as head constable after 20. They usually retired as assistant sub-inspector after more than 30 years of service. After the restructuring,police constables will directly get promoted to post of head constables after 10 years of service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-45k-cops-to-be-promoted-as-naik-post-is-scrapped/articleshow/87050885.cms||---

He had secured AIR-196 in JEE Mains last month. But his determination and confidence paid off because on Friday results put him in Top 10 AIR, way above his original aim. His ranking in the country in JEE Advanced is sixth. Soni has become the second candidate from Gujarat after Bharat Khandelwal with AIR-5 in 2015 to find a place in Top 10 rankings of JEE Advanced.

I was always confident about achieving my goal in JEE Advanced despite all odds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/he-aimed-for-top-50-shot-to-6th-rank/articleshow/87048792.cms||---
---||Goa||For the first time in 2 decades, 15 from Goa break into top 10,000 in JEE-Advanced||PANAJI: At least 17 students from Goa bagged ranks at the JEE Advanced, results for which were declared on Friday. Of these, around 15 had ranks which figured in the top 10,000 all-India ranks. This is the highest number from Goa to bag such ranks after 2000. Ponda-resident Harsh Khandeparkar, with an all-India rank of 1,393, has the best-known rank in Goa so far. “I am still undecided about the stream. But I am interested in pursuing the stream of electrical engineering from one of the old IITs, if I get through,” said Harsh. The next two ranks known so far from Goa are Agrajah Bhobe with 1,457 and Sairaj Ghosarwadkar with 1,800. Also making the cut were Swatit Rau Valaulicar at 3,026, Manali Manjarekar with 3,077, Ratan Doddalingannavar with 3,901, Joshua Dias Barreto with 4,142 and Rujula Kamat with 4,196. These students were within the first 5,000 ranks in the country, and for the first time in many years, it included two female students. Most of the ranks for the state were from a single school, Mushtifund Aryaan Higher Secondary School, Cujira. “The first three ranks are within 1,800 and the first eight within 4,200 from Mushtifund Aryaan,” said its director Vyankatesh Prabhudesai. “And we have 15 ranks within 10,000 all-India ranks. The first eight ranks, which are within the AIR of 2,800 are sure to get seats at one of the old IITs. The two girls, Manali and Rujula, will have an added advantage as female students in the seat allotment process.” The other ranks so far from Goa are Akhil Naik (5,245), Tejas Tendulkar (5,864), Nilay Kamat (7,033), Vishal Tari (7,178), Abhinn Tari (7,447), Aditya Bhat (7,961), R Hariharan (9,476), besides two ranks within the first 20,000 in the country — Amit Kuvelkar (13,375) and Adi Nesarkar (17,766). Harsh said that attempting the JEE during the pandemic had its upside and downside. “We got more time to study due to the pandemic (with the altered academic schedule). We had regular online classes, which was good, only the interaction during online classes is not equal as during offline sessions. At our institute, we answered a lot of mock tests, which helped us be prepared for the exam,” said Harsh. He advised other students attempting the entrance test to the IITs to focus on consistency when answering the JEE rather than trying to answer more questions at a faster pace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-first-in-2-decades-15-from-goa-in-top-10k-in-jee-advanced/articleshow/87050810.cms||---
---||Goa||‘BJP had 10 years to make Goa model state, but failed’||PANAJI: In a sharp reaction to Union home minister Amit Shah’s statement that Goa will be made a model state with “development beyond expectations” after the 2022 assembly elections, Congress on Friday questioned why BJP could not do so over the last decade. Congress said that the development that Shah promised will convert Goa into a hub for criminal activity, coal transportation and drug trafficking. “Goans are well aware of the misdeeds of BJP and will never ever give a third chance to BJP. The identity of Goa will be completely erased by destroying the environment and nature,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar at a press conference at the party head office. Congress also questioned why Shah did not speak on mining resumption, Covid deaths due to shortage of oxygen, non-availability of internet connections for students and Goa’s worrisome debt. “The promise made by home minister Amit Shah of converting Goa into a model state is another jumla. What stopped BJP from developing the state in the last 10 years? BJP focussed on making fortunes by pushing the state into bankruptcy and Goans into huge financial burden,” said Chodankar. Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, who was present for the press briefing, said BJP is responsible for the steep hike in fuel prices as well as rising inflation. “If BJP had done development in the last nine years, there would have been no need for Amit Shah to come to Goa begging for votes,” said Lourenco. Congress said BJP had already allowed the Karnataka government to divert water from the Mhadei water basin for political benefits. “In the name of development they will hand over Goa’s rivers to the corporates like Adani and Ambani. They will forcibly start the marina project at Nauxim, manipulate the coastal zone management plan to pave the way for capitalists to take over Goa’s coastline and extend the port’s limits,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-had-10-yrs-to-make-goa-model-state-but-failed/articleshow/87050813.cms||---

With ‘say no to drinks, say no to drugs’ as the message, the workers of the two missions, along with civic-body councillors, interacted with children in 150 households each of Vallakkadavu and Poonthura wards in city corporation limits. Besides speaking to the children about the harmful effects of drugs, the team also gifted them Dr A P J Abdul Kalam’s books and pamphlets carrying messages against use of narcotics. The house visits was led by assistant excise commissioner P K Jayaraj, who is also the manager of the Vimukthi mission (Thiruvananthapuram district), councillors Shajitha Nasser and Mary Gypsy among others. Vimukthi mission and Kudumbashree volunteers will together continue the anti-drug drive by visiting houses in the coming days in other areas of the corporation and local bodies of Thiruvananthapuram district. The house visits are as part of the anti- drug addiction awareness campaign organised in the coastal areas of the district. Messages of Mahatma Gandhi, who waged a relentless battle against drug addiction through his constructive programmes, will be propagated on a mission-mode as part of the campaign that primarily targets the youth. Apart from this, the excise department’s ‘Unarvu’ project that aims to curb the use of drugs among schoolchildren is already in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/drive-launched-to-curb-drug-use-among-children/articleshow/87048838.cms||---
---||Goa||We are in talks with Cong, TMC for alliance, says MGP||Panaji: Firmly declaring that MGP will not ally with BJP for the upcoming assembly elections, the regional party’s state president, Pandurang Dhavalikar, said on Friday that the party would take a final call about selecting an alliance partner, if any, by November 15. “We are not going with BJP. We will go with any other political party that is healthy for us. We are in talks with Congress and Trinamool Congress (TMC),” Dhavalikar said. Dhavalikar was reacting to a statement by BJP’s Goa election in-charge, Devendra Fadnavis, that BJP has “not closed its doors to anyone” regarding alliances. “We are not a party with closed doors,” Fadnavis had said. However, Dhavalikar said, “Even if BJP approaches us, we will not sit for alliance talks with them. We have selected candidates in 12 constituencies, what are we supposed to do with those candidates?” MGP has started preparations in 12 assembly constituencies, including four in Ponda taluka, two each in Bicholim and Pernem talukas, and the constituencies of Sanvordem and Curchorem. He also said that MGP would not ally with BJP because they have been thrown out of BJP-led coalition governments twice. “We don’t want to get cheated (yet again) by joining BJP,” Dhavalikar said. Senior MGP leader Ramkrishna Dhavalikar had met Fadnavis in Mumbai recently. Asked about the meeting, Fadnavis said, “We are yet to take a political decision (on the MGP alliance). When we take a political decision, we will be able to say.” “I-PAC’s Prashant Kishor met me, Congress Goa desk incharge Dinesh Gundu Rao met me. I had a one-hour long meeting with TMC’s I-PAC,” Dhavalikar had said on Wednesday. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday that an alliance would be decided after discussions. The meeting between Fadnavis and Dhavalikar had raised eyebrows in political circles. Even as questions were and continue to be raised on whether BJP is looking to forge a pre-poll alliance with MGP, Dhavalikar said that given the present political situation, he does not want any alliance with BJP. In 2007, when MGP joined BJP to topple the Digambar Kamat-led Congress government, the MGP MLAs were disqualified. Later, in 2012, MGP had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and the alliance had won an absolute majority. However, after former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was elevated as defence minister, MGP had differences with then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and was dropped from the cabinet. In 2017, after the state sembly election results, MGP supported BJP to form a new coalition government under the leadership of Parrikar, but after his demise, Sawant split MGP. Of the party’s three MGP MLAs, two joined BJP and Dhavalikar was again dropped from the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/we-are-in-talks-with-cong-tmc-for-alliance-says-mgp/articleshow/87050888.cms||---
---||Goa||Entry of TMC has rattled BJP, Congress: Faleiro||PANAJI: Former Congress spokesperson and social activist Swati Kerkar joined All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) party on Friday along with former executive committee member of BJP Goa Mahila Morcha Diksha Talavanekar and Jayesh Shetgaonkar. TMC also opened its party office in the state capital coinciding with the auspicious occasion of Vijaya Dashami. Former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro said that TMC’s entry into the 2022 assembly election fray has rattled BJP and Congress. “Other parties are not being attacked, only TMC is being attacked. Posters of TMC are being taken down, not the posters of other political parties. The real opposition is TMC and nobody else. We are street fighters,” said Faleiro. Kerkar, the daughter of freedom fighter Sridhar Kerkar, was formerly associated with Aam Aadmi Party. She said that she joined TMC as Congress and AAP did not give her a platform to take independent decisions in favour of the people of Goa. “I am so glad TMC, led by Mamata Banerjee, has decided to come to Goa. She is a fiery leader who has put women empowerment at the top of her agenda. I have full faith in her leadership,” said Kerkar. Shetgaonkar, a former AAP member, is a social activist who heads the anti-coal activist group ‘Goa Against Coal’, and is a member of ‘Goencho Ekvott’. TMC has been on an induction spree as it prepares itself for the coming assembly elections in Goa where the Mamata Banerjee-led party hopes to corner a sizeable vote share. Faleiro indirectly blamed Congress for BJP’s unfettered rise across the country. “If you count, 187 MLAs were purchased from Congress. Who purchased them and how were they purchased? This needs to be studied and analysed,” said Faleiro. TMC's parliamentary party leader (Rajya Sabha), Derek O'Brien, Yatish Naik, Antonio Clovis and independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar were present for the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/entry-of-tmc-has-rattled-bjp-congress-faleiro/articleshow/87050853.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Nadiad man’s hands to go to Mumbai youth||AHMEDABAD: The state has seen donations of organs such as kidney, liver, lungs and even heart, but on Friday, Gujarat created a record of sorts when a pair of hands were retrieved from a brain-dead patient at Civil Hospital. The limbs were sent to Mumbai for a transplant on a 22-year-old youth. It was the first-ever hand donation from the state and only fifth of both hands in India, said experts. It was also the first successful lung donation from Civil Hospital. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent, said that Arun Prajapati, 52, a resident of Nadiad in Kheda district, was brought to the hospital earlier this month for the treatment of brain tumour. The tumour did not heal, and Prajapati was declared brain dead. The experts counselled his family and told them that retrieval of organs is possible. “The ROTTO and NOTTO had earlier put on an alert for bilateral hands for a patient in Mumbai. In the past three organ donations, the profiles did not match. But this time, several parameters matche, so for the first time, the hands were retrieved from a brain-dead person which will give a new lease of life to the youth,” said Dr Pranjal Modi, vice-chancellor of ITS and convenor of State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO). Dr Joshi said that hand retrieval and attachment is a complex procedure that requires a team of highly skilled surgeons. “It’s surgical amputation which is done keeping all veins, tissues and muscles intact.

Retired scientist and social activist, Joe D’Souza has attributed the reason for the same to the food-chain cycle getting affected due to either external or internal pollution in the sea. “Owing to heavy rainfall, there has been a lot of run off organic matter that has entered into the sea. Inland vessels like casinos and trawlers that are operational now discharge the sewage into the water causing external pollution. This causes a growth in bacteria which take up the oxygen meant for the fish. Their gills are clogged as a result, causing suffocation,” he said. Small fish such as vellio, burante, etc, washed up on the Miramar beach’s shores in bulk leaving visitors baffled, especially since the beach is not a prominent fishing beach. Besides the external pollutants, the expert has attributed internal pollution of the waters as a reason for the mass mortality of the fish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-baffled-as-shoals-of-dead-fish-wash-ashore-at-miramar/articleshow/87050915.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Temple priest held for ganja peddling||Thiruvananthapuram: The excise officials under Vamanapuram range on Thursday arrested a young temple priest who was allegedly involved in the business of ganja sale. The officials identified the accused as Vaisakh, 22, of Puthenmadam, Pirappancode. A stash of 1.1 kilogram of ganja was seized from his possession. The arrest was made by a team led by Vamanapuram excise inspector G Mohankumar. He said the sale and use of ganja have increased among youngsters in Vembayam, Venjaramoodu and Pothencode regions. It was an investigation into the source of another peddler arrested recently that led them to Vaisakh. The accused stayed with his octogenarian paternal grandmother and it was from this house, the contraband was seized. The excise inspector said Vaishakh has been allegedly doing this business for the past six months. The accused told the officials that he started using ganja at the age of 15. After completing higher secondary education, he started working as a priest at a small temple at Pirappancode. Since he felt that the salary of this job was not good enough, he decided to get into ganja peddling.

He was implementing Covid restrictions near Sanaur grain market on April 12 last year in Patiala, when a group of Nihang Sikhs chopped off his hand after being stopped. He still believes that only a few elements in any religious faction or section of society may be bad, but not all. Harjit was promoted to the rank of SI from assistant SI a week after the incident that hogged international headlines. He is continuing his job in the police department with CCTV van section of Patiala range. Commenting on the incident at Singhu border on Friday, Harjit said, “A few elements may be bad in any section of society or a religion or a faction, but not all. The entire community should not be blamed for the error committed by a few bad elements. Desecration of any religion or religious symbols needs to be condemned,” he said. “I face difficulty while typing the content on computer or laptop during my job, while in personal life too I had to struggle to perform daily routine activities. Thankfully, I am right-handed and my left hand too has now recovered up to 50% function,” he added. Harjit’s hand was reattached by a team of plastic surgeons at PGIMER in Chandigarh on the same day, after a challenging 7.5-hour-long surgery. After the attack, eight persons were nabbed by the police within hours for attempt to murder and under sections of UAPA. All of them are behind bars and statements of the SI and some government eyewitnesses have been recorded so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/a-few-elements-of-a-religious-faction-maybe-bad-not-all-cop-whose-hand-was-chopped-off/articleshow/87051540.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Ahmedabad||Semiconductor shortage slams brakes on Dussehra car sales in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Even though demand for cars is high this year, dealers failed to cash-in due to supply constraints caused by the global semiconductor shortage. Data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA) show that vehicle sales on Dussehra fell by 7.7% in Gujarat this year, compared to purchases last year, when the Covid pandemic was raging and several restrictions were in place. Some 6,800 cars and 19,500 two-wheelers were delivered from showrooms across the state, according to FADA data. This was much lower than the 21,000 car deliveries and 7,500 two-wheeler deliveries on Dussehra last year. “That demand for cars is upbeat this year is clear from the booking numbers remaining high. However, dealers are facing a serious inventory crisis, as automakers have cut production. Consequently, dealers are unable to meet demand from customers and see sales revive,” said Pranav Shah, the Gujarat region chairman of FADA. Car dealers have barely ten days worth of inventory and even then in-demand models are not available. “I booked my car and the delivery was expected on Dussehra, but due to some constraints, I will be taking delivery on Dhanteras now,” said a citybased professional who asked not to be named. Companies are offering attractive good discounts and dealers are also offering incentives to draw buyers. “Demand is good but the supply shortage is eroding our festive season business. A major bottleneck is that customers cannot get models of their choice and are compelled to settle for other models,” said Jigar Vyas, the CEO of a dealership in Ahmedabad. “For certain models, wait times have increased to as high as eight months and we’ve stopped accepting orders. We’ve told prospective customers to leave their contact details and we will get back to them whenever the cars are available,” Vyas added. Many dealers said that they’re expecting deliveries from manufacturers in the second half of October and expect sales to be good in the Dhanteras-Diwali period. Industry players say the majority of buyers are opting for financing and are reducing down payments. Non-banking finance companies are also offering attractive interest rates, dealers say. Two-wheeler demand low: As far as two-wheelers are concerned, demand was muted even with partial reopening of colleges. “Student buyers account for a major chunk of our customers. However, with schools and colleges not reopening, even the muhurat demand was muted. Simultaneously, the cost of ownership of a vehicle has gone up significantly. While vehicle costs have increased by 20% due to the BS-VI regime rollout, fuel prices have raised cost of ownership of two-wheelers significantly,” said Pranav Shah, Gujarat region chairman of FADA. Dealers said that while high-end motorcycles had supply constraints due to the chip shortage, mid-level models are in great demand along with gearless two-wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/semiconductor-shortage-slams-brakes-on-dussehra-car-sales/articleshow/87048927.cms||Niyati Parikh

The complainant, a 56-year-old resident of Hirawadi, said that he has a shop at Aurangabad Naka. On Monday, at around 11 am, he took around Rs3.40 lakh to deposit in the bank. Upon reaching the shop, he kept the cash bag in a drawer at the counter. At around 8.30 pm, he put the money in the scooter’s storage unit and drove home. He forgot to remove the bag from his scooter and went to sleep. The next day at around 11am, he began looking for the cash bag in the house and then realised he had left in the scooter. But when he checked the scooter, he found that the bag was missing, after which he registered an offence at the Panchavati police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs3-40l-cash-stolen-from-bike-storage/articleshow/87058205.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Former Siolim MLA’s son hits out at Lobo for ‘interference’||Saligao: A day after the controversy over a free harvester machine broke out in Siolim between Calangute MLA Michael Lobo and former BJP MLA and minister Dayanand Mandrekar, the Siolim BJP youth block on Thursday hit out against Lobo for allegedly flouting party discipline and ethics by “interfering” in other constituencies. Addressing reporters at Oxel, Siolim BJP youth wing president and Dayanand’s son, Sameer, said, “We have told the party that he (Lobo) has no right to interfere in another constituency and party seniors have already told him not to do so.” “The people of Siolim don’t want all the vices from the tourist village of Calangute to spread in Siolim with the blessings of the MLA and they should be vigilant in this constituency,” Mandrekar said. Sameer refuted Lobo’s statement that one BJP group was involved in doing dadagiri with the driver of the harvesting machine. “In fact, we even gave the driver money to buy diesel for the machine. The MLA could not digest the fact that even we are trying to help the farmers. He only wants to take credit that he is doing social work for the farmers of Siolim,” Sameer said, adding that Lobo was trying to win support for his wife in Siolim “because he knows very well of his losing prospects in Calangute constituency”. The ports minister’s wife Delilah and Dayanand are both vying for a ticket from the constituency. He called Lobo “a virus from Calangute” who has come to Siolim to lure voters. Lobo on Thursday had said Dayanand, though without naming him, was doing “dadagiri” over the petty issue of a harvesting machine. Lobo said that he bought the machine with his money, but the former MLA wanted to take credit for it. He alleged that on Wednesday night, when the machine arrived, a few people along with relatives of a former BJP MLA arrived and not only took away the keys of the machine, but also threatened the driver and took away his phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-siolim-mlas-son-hits-out-at-lobo-for-interference/articleshow/87050935.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Durga idols immersed amid chants, prayers in Prayagraj||Prayagraj: Amidst the shouting of the slogan ‘Joi Durga maai ki joi’ and applying gulal on each other's faces, idols of goddess Durga were immersed by different Barwari’s and Durga puja samitis on Friday. Thousands of devotees reached the pond at Andhwa (Jhunsi) and paid adieu to the goddess by immersing the idols of the deity after four days of worshipping. Like the practice of the previous year, the district administration had this year too arranged for the immersion of the idols at the pond at Andhawa, Jhunsi. This was done by the administration for better management of devotees given the Covid-19 protocols. Since Friday noon, all roads leading to this pond witnessed the arrival of devotees along with the vehicles on which the idols were placed. As the administration had allowed smaller idols this year, almost all the vehicles carrying the idols were also small. The administration had allowed vehicles to arrive from one road and leave the immersion site from another route, thereby avoiding the traffic jam and better management of the event. “Elaborative arrangements were made by the district administration and around 550 idols were immersed in the pond at Andhawa. The idol arrived even till 8pm and along with immersion, cleaning of the pond was being taken up by the teams deployed by Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMS) and the same would continue on Saturday as well," said ADM (City), Madan Kumar. The event passed off peacefully without any untoward incident, he added. This year also witnessed smaller processions with the limit on the number of people reaching the immersion site. Sprinkling Gulal on each other and dancing to the tune of Dhaki and Nagada (drum), different Barwari and Samitis reached the immersion site. Almost everyone was seen wearing a mask. From wacky themes to the traditional ones, the city’s Durga Puja idols this year were designed with pearls, pulses, leaves while the idols of the mother goddess ranging from the conventional clay ones to even those decorated with other items. Young boys and girls along with seniors of the family were seen dancing to the hit numbers. Around 550 small and big idols of the goddess Durga were immersed in the pond. Emotionally charged chants of “Bolo joi Durga mai ki”, reverberated across the calm pond amid adequate security arrangements by the local police and volunteers of civil defence. The event passed off peacefully under the watchful eyes of the district administration. Although because of the social distancing norms and not much space for the immersion ritual, people wished things were the way they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. The district administration had made elaborative arrangements for the immersion of Durga idols at the pond. Stairs, using sandbags, were constructed near the pond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/durga-idols-immersed-amid-chants-prayers-in-prayagraj/articleshow/87068947.cms||---

About 100 new real estate projects were launched during the Navratri festivities and on the auspicious day of Dussehra. “Both new launches and sales have gained good momentum in Navratri and Dussehra with around 90-100 new projects, mainly in residential and mixed development segment, being unveiled in Ahmedabad in this period,” said Ashish Patel, former president, CREDAI-Gujarat. “Unsold home inventory has come to near-zero levels, demand is very strong, and consumer sentiment has improved substantially. Home loan interest rates are also at their lowest levels. These factors are responsible for the spurt in new launches,” Patel added. According to real estate developers, launches and sales are far better than last year, when the Covid-19 pandemic had badly affected sales and launches. This year, new projects have been rolled out across segments such as apartments, mixed development and plotting schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/realty-project-launches-rise-during-navratri/articleshow/87048946.cms||---
---||Dehradun||5 months on, CTR opens for night stay; hills see tourist rush on long wknd||Nainital/Mussoorie: After staying out of bounds for five and a half months, the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has reopened for night stays, with bookings selling out within just 48 hours. This comes even as hill towns of Mussoorie and Nainital recorded heavy tourist influx for the long weekend on Dussehra. Corbett director, Rahul (who only uses his first name), said the stays inside the reserve were closed for tourists in May, but Bijrani, Jhirna and Dhela zones have reopened for tourists. “We were flooded with requests within hours of reopening and because of the long weekend, all accommodation inside the reserve is full until Tuesday,” he said. According to the Corbett administration, 80 bookings were received in just 48 hours after the reopening on Wednesday. While the day safaris were already permitted in other zones, the administration has now allowed tourists to travel into the Bijrani zone, which is popular for tiger sightings. And it’s not just accommodation inside the reserve which is full, resorts and hotels on its periphery have also recorded full occupancy for the weekend. Hari Mann, president of Ramnagar hotels association, told TOI that almost all the hotels are full. “This weekend, we are completely booked and tourists have been calling and inquiring about the next few days as well. Even requests for wedding venues have picked up,” Mann said. The long Dussehra weekend has also brought hordes of tourists to Nainital. According to officials, traffic to Nainital had to be stopped at Rusi Bypass on Haldwani highway and Narayan Nagar on Kaladhungi Road. The tourists have been asked to take shuttles from these locations to the lake town. Hoteliers in Mussoorie have also reported 90% to 100% occupancy for the Dussehra weekend. Traffic snarls were recorded in the town near Gandhi Chowk, Picture Palace and the Mall Road. “Tourist influx is particularly good this weekend in Mussoorie as well as in other destinations in Uttarakhand. Hotels in Mussoorie have reported about 80 to 85% occupancy for the weekend while most hotels across popular tourist destinations in the state are reporting similar numbers. While it is impossible to recover from the losses so soon, tourism picking up again is good news for everyone,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotels Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5-months-on-ctr-opens-for-night-stay-hills-see-tourist-rush-on-long-wknd/articleshow/87047373.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Allahabad||Dy CM lays foundation of 4-lane rlwy over bridge, flyover||Prayagraj: Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Saturday laid the foundation stone of four-lane Railway Over Bridge (ROB) at Chaufatka-Bamrauli Airport-Subedarganj railway station and a double lane flyover connecting GT Road to Kanpur Road. The “bhoomi pujan” ceremony took place on 60 Feet Road area. State cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh, MPs Kesari Devi Patel and Rita Bahuguna Joshi were also present during the ceremony. “A total of around Rs 284.21 crore has been approved for this flyover and ROB. It will be completed in 24 months. The construction of around 660 metres long double-lane flyover and 1.58km long four-lane ROB will not only facilitate quick travel from GT Road to the Bamrauli airport, but will also facilitate travel to the Buddhist pilgrimage sites of Kaushambi. These projects would speed up the development of Allahabad West constituency area,” deputy CM said. Speaking on the occasion, Maurya said, “As this is election time, so lot of parties are going to approach BJP and the party could consider some of them, but the doors would only be opened only for the ones which approve the ideologies of BJP. The party has place for only ‘acchi parties’ as there is no place for ‘gande log’ (bad people).” The importance of these projects can be gauged from the fact that to reach the airport from Civil Lines, one has to cover a distance of about 16 km today. One has to deal with the traffic jams in areas like Dhumanganj, Sulem Sarai while going to the airport. It takes roughly one-and-a-half hours to travel 16 km. Along with this, people also have to face pollution due to traffic jams, but after the construction of the flyover, this journey will be covered in mere 20 to 25 minutes. Addressing the gathering, the deputy CM said development projects across the state have been undertaken at a mega scale during CM Yogi Adityanath’s government. He said construction work of Inner Ring road was well under way and this would further free the district from the problem of traffic snarls and help increase the pace of development of the region. A four-lane model road was also on the cards between Kokhraj and Handia, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dy-cm-lays-foundation-of-4-lane-rlwy-over-bridge-flyover/articleshow/87068991.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||He couldn’t have gone to Singhu border on his own, say kin of deceased||Cheema Kalan (Tarn Taran): Lakhbir Singh alias Titu, whose hand was chopped off in Taliban-style punishment allegedly by a Nihang group at Delhi’s Singhu border, was father of three young girls and worked as a farm labourer. The 36-year-old was a drug addict, according to his family. His relatives, neighbours and villagers couldn’t believe what had happened to him at farm protest site. Now, they say, they expect the government to not only to arrest and punish his murderers but also extend financial help to his wife and three daughters. One of the relatives of Titu, Balkar Singh said here that the victim hailed from nearby Kalas village and his father Darshan Singh had died about six years ago. “He was in the habit of taking drugs and would steal anything from the house to arrange the next dose. Due to his addiction, people were not willing to hire him,” he said and added that Titu never harassed anyone. Titu’s wife Jaspreet Kaur had left his house around five years ago with their daughters Tanya, 12, Sonia, 10, and Kuldeep, 8. Titu was now living with his aunt Mohinder Kaur and his sister Raj Kaur, whose husband Manga had died about nine years ago. Balkar wondered how the victim managed to reach Singhu. “He couldn’t have gone there on his own, somebody must have allured him with drugs or money. He is just not capable of going all the way to Singhu border on his own,” he claimed. Titu’s wife refused to speak to media. His uncle Balkar added, “He is gone but now the government should think of his family and expose the persons behind the incident. They should also find out how they managed to take Titu there.” His sister Raj Kaur said that Titu was with some Nihangs in the area but she didn’t know that who were they and where he had gone. “On October 13, he left home saying that he was going to the grain market. There was no news of him till today morning,” she said. SHO Sarai police station Amanat Khan Balwinder Singh said there was no criminal record of Lakhbir Singh but it was rumoured that he was a drug addict. “We don’t have any case registered against him, now people say that he used to consume bhang or some other intoxicant,” he added. He confirmed other details related to the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/family-of-man-lynched-for-alleged-desecration-say-he-must-have-been-lured-for-drugs-or-money/articleshow/87051562.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: New BDD flats to go to govt in case of family disputes||MUMBAI: The government will take over the 500-square-foot free flats of BDD chawl tenants in case of family disputes. A circular issued by the housing department on Thursday says the flat will be registered in the name of director, BDD chawls, if families are unable to resolve their differences. The Rs 17,000-crore BDD chawl redevelopment project will result in around 7,000 families benefiting from the scheme. These families currently reside in 160-sq-ft homes at Worli, N M Joshi Marg and Naigaum in Dadar. The price of new flats is estimated to be in crores of rupees which these families cannot afford. All the three sprawling sites are centrally located and once redeveloped would change the skyline of central Mumbai. Raju Waghmare, president, Akhil BDD Chaali Sarva Sanghatana Ekatrit Sangh, who has been fighting for individual agreements for every tenant before being shifted out to transit camps said at least 40% families are already in dispute over the ownership of the new flat. “There are joint families that still continue to live together in these tiny tenements and there are families where some of the siblings have moved residence but have laid claim to a share of the flat. The father died and the sons are fighting for a share in the new flat,” he said. Kiran Mane, general secretary, Akhil BDD Chawl Bhadekaru Haqq Sanrakshan Samiti, said there were at least three to four family disputes in every building in all the three BDD complexes. “We have instances of police complaints being filed, physical fights between members of a family. There are cases where the tenement has been transferred in the name of the elder brother on the assurance that the others would get their share when the tenement is redeveloped but he has now refused to honour his word,” said Mane. Waghmare said the government must not interfere in family disputes. He cited the case of Prateeksha Nagar where Mhada had built homes in the 1990s. “Several families had disputes so the government took over the tenements and locked them. The locks were broken and illegally occupied. The government could not throw out the encroachers. Finally the Devendra Fadnavis government regularised the encroachments. A similar situation will ensue here,” he said. Mane said his organisation had suggested to the government to form a three-member conciliatory committee headed by the local MLA with the director and a Mhada official as members. Waghmare, though, said for BDD chawls too names of heirs should be recordedin the agreement like in the land records (7/12 extract) after the head of a family dies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-bdd-flats-to-go-to-govt-in-case-of-family-disputes/articleshow/87051002.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: CM Ashok Gehlot meets Ambika Soni in Delhi ahead of CWC meet today||JAIPUR: A day ahead of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot reached Delhi on Friday evening and is likely to hold talks with the Congress central leadership on the sidelines of the meeting. After reaching Delhi on Friday evening, Gehlot met senior leader Ambika Soni, a close aide of Congress interim chief Sonia Gandhi, said sources. It is believed the CWC would focus on taking on the G-23 leaders who have been posing a challenge to the Gandhi family’s leadership. After the second Covid wave, CWC will be meeting in-person for the first time. Besides Gehlot, three more leaders from Rajasthan — AICC general secretary in charge of Assam Jitendra Singh, AICC in charge of Gujarat Raghu Sharma and former MP Raghuvir Singh Meena, a CWC member — will be attending the meeting. Gehlot, who has strong ties with the Congress central leadership, was vocal against the party’s G-23 leaders in earlier CWC meetings. At the same time, Gehlot’s Delhi visit, which has come after a long gap, assumes significance amid the pressure built up by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his loyalists demanding changes in the state government. Besides demanding a cabinet rejig, state-level political appointments and expansion of the party state unit, Pilot has been seeking the CM’s post, said sources. Anticipating Gehlot’s visit, Pilot was in Delhi from Tuesday till Thursday. He met his loyalists, including party’s sitting MLAs, at his residence in Jaipur on Friday. Sources said a section of the Congress was again stressing on implementing the ‘Kamaraj formula’ of 1963 as a solution to the internal strife in the party’s state units like Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. K Kamaraj had resigned as chief minister of Tamil Nadu and opted for a role in the organisation to revitalise Congress that was losing popularity in the aftermath of the 1962 Indo-China war. Five Congress CMs and six Union ministers had followed Kamaraj in stepping down from their posts and taking up roles in the organisation to revitalise Congress. “In Rajasthan, it seems the beginning has already been made. Health minister Raghu Sharma has been made incharge of Gujarat, education minister Govind Singh Dotasra is heading the PCC and now there are indications that revenue minister Harish Chaudhary may be the Punjab incharge soon. Strong leaders are being given organisational responsibilities, while next generation Congressmen could replace them in the government,” said a Congress veteran, comparing the recent developments to the Kamaraj formula.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-meets-ambikasoni-in-delhi-ahead-of-cwc-meet-today/articleshow/87051000.cms||---

Even though the consumer sentiment has remained upbeat, a surge in prices over the past fortnight kept purchases under check. Estimates of the India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA) suggest that some 200kg of gold was retailed in Gujarat in a single day on Dussehra which is considered auspicious for buying the precious metal. Gold price stood at Rs 49,250 per 10 gram on Friday. “Gold price rose by Rs 1,850 over the past fortnight, increasing from Rs 47,400 per10 gram on September 30 to Rs 49,250 per 10 gram on the Dussehra day,” said Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA. “Backed by a marginal increase in international gold prices, coupled with the devaluation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, the yellow metal price increased.” Muhurat purchases fuel jewellery sales in Gujarat year after year. Estimates of Ahmedabad-based jewellers suggest that purchases were largely spurred by wedding jewellery, delivery of which was taken on the Dussehra muhurat. “Besides wedding jewellery, people came in for fresh purchases as well. We saw good demand for lightweight jewellery which people use for daily wear,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). “Demand for coins and bars was equally good, not just from regular investors but also from the younger generation, which has begun saving, in this pandemic era.” Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller, said: “The demand for bars and coins is quite good, as is for jewellery. But for high-value purchases, at least 50% of the customers are exchanging old gold.” Even the demand for silver was good as scores of customers bought not just bars, coins, and artefacts but also lightweight jewellery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-gold-prices-take-lustre-off-festival-purchases/articleshow/87049023.cms||Niyati Parikh

Mridul got 96.66% or 348 out of 360 marks which has never been achieved till now in JEE-Advanced. He had also scored 100 percentile in February and March JEE-Mains attempts. Giving credit of success to his parents, Mridul said he plans to join IIT-Bombay. “I want to pursue graduation in computer science as IT is a growing field and the future. Since I started preparing for the examination, I have been consistent and focused. Every day after coaching, I study on my own following a time table. For the last four years, my routine has helped me a lot in getting 100 percentile in JEE-Mains and clearing JEE-Advanced.” Mridul is a resident of Shyam Nagar in Jaipur and has studied at Allen Career Institute in the city. When asked about whether he expected that he would create history, Mridul said that though he expected to pass the examination, such a good result was a surprise for him as well. He said he was disturbed when the lockdown was imposed. He started online classes and his screen time increased. Watching online videos and web series were a distraction but he again focused on studies. “I reminded myself that it was just for a year and that it would define my career growth and started preparing again. With the lockdown, my commutation time was saved and I productively utilised it for myself,” he said. His parents were immensely proud of their son’s achievement. His father, Pradeep Agarwal, an accounts manager in a private firm, said, “I am really happy with my son getting such a high score. I am hoping that after he completes his bachelor’s degree, he could get admission in some foreign university for M.Tech. After that I want my son to return to our motherland and work for the betterment of the nation.” Mridul said that it was necessary to have faith in yourself as not everyone would have trust in your talent. He underlined the importance of self-study to crack exams which he felt was required to achieve anything.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-boy-secures-first-position-injeea-with-record-score-of-348/360/articleshow/87051014.cms||---

The court was hearing the bail pleas of five people - Balamurugan, Maruthupandian, Premnath, Moorthy and Karthick who were arrested by the Manamadurai police on September 29. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioners along with other accused, had illegally transported river sand in a lorry, without valid permit. The additional public prosecutor submitted that the investigation in this case is yet to be completed. He further submitted that there is one similar previous case against Balamurugan and there are no previous cases against the others. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged. He further submitted that the petitioners are willing to pay money as non-refundable deposit in favour of a government school. Taking into account the nature of minerals and antecedents of the petitioners, justice S Ananthi granted bail to the petitioners by directing Balamurugan to pay Rs 20,000 and the other petitioners to pay Rs 15,000 each as non-refundable amount to the credit of the headmaster of the government higher secondary school at Y Othakadai in Madurai. Similarly, another person Mohamed Rishwan who was arrested in connection with an illegal sand mining in Ramanathapuram district on September 30, moved the HC seeking bail.

---||Madurai||HC: Plea to publish course book at less cost reasonable||Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the state government to consider a representation by the Tamil Nadu Typewriting - Shorthand - Computer Institutes Sangam to publish a book for a certificate course at an affordable cost, observing that it was a reasonable request. The court passed the order while disposing of a petition filed by Soma Sankar, president of the association based at Srivilliputhur in Virudhunagar district. In his petition, the petitioner stated that the course on ‘Computer on Office Automation’, is offered by the directorate of technical education and the curriculum is framed by a team of experts. The course is conducted twice a year during June and December. He stated that nearly 8,000 candidates who are unable to pursue their higher education due to their economical background, are undergoing the course every year. During the introduction of this course in 2002, the directorate, by covering the entire syllabus, had published a book which cost Rs 145. The experts had revised the syllabus in 2015, however, instead of publishing a book for the same, a list of books covering the entire syllabus was notified. The petitioner stated that a copy of the books covering the syllabus cost nearly Rs 48,000. It is not affordable either by the candidates or by the institutes which train the candidates. He stated that repeated requests to the department by the candidates and the institutes to publish one book covering the entire syllabus at an affordable cost, were not heeded to. Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed that the request by the petitioner appears to be a reasonable one, especially keeping in mind the economic status of people pursuing such courses. It is necessary that prompt action be taken in such regard by the authorities. Hence, the judge directed the principal secretary of the higher education department to take appropriate steps in this regard by considering the petitioner’s representation and by taking into account the observations of this court, within a period of two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-plea-to-publish-course-book-at-less-cost-reasonable/articleshow/87051013.cms||---

The Saamna editorial, titled, ‘Where is the freedom’, said that Maharashtra was witnessing load shedding due to the coal crisis and blamed the Centre for it. “Due to the clumsy and corrupt handling of the coal sector by the centre, there are fears that five states, including Maharashtra, will be plunged into darkness. There are many unanswered questions. Why is there a sudden coal shortage? Did the centre create an artificial coal shortage for the benefit of certain industrialists? The people have lost faith in the central government. This vyapari (trader) government akin to the East India Company can go to any level to make sure some industrialists profit,” the editorial read. Referring to the Centre’s ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’, the editorial asked, “But is there really freedom of speech in the country today? Those who ask questions to the government, call a spade a spade or even take a stand against the government are harassed by raids of the central agencies like CBI, ED, NCB and Income Tax (I-T) department. Is there any freedom left to speak out and write here? The flag of Ravana’s rule is being hoisted by filing false cases against those who speak out. Is this freedom?” asked the editorial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-drags-bjp-over-the-coals-calls-it-east-india-co/articleshow/87051015.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Seeking a stay on their arrest, the accused had knocked on the door of the sessions court, which turned down their plea earlier this week. Declared proclaimed offenders, the duo has been evading the police, who have been unable to track them down so far. Meanwhile, the health department has slapped notices on Kumbh mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar and health officer in-charge Dr NK Tyagi, who were suspended for their role in the testing scam, asking the two to file a reply within 15 days. In their defence, Mallika Pant and Sharat Pant, through their advocate, had stated that Max Corporate Services was in agreement with Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Laboratories for providing manpower and other logistics. Both labs were responsible for sample collection, testing, data feeding and verification of Covid testing during Kumbh, the Pants had alleged. When queried about the delay in getting to the main accused in the scam, circle officer (city), Abhay Singh told TOI, “We are trying to trace them. The court has already declared them proclaimed offenders. We have pasted notices outside their residences in Noida and Haryana and will soon seize their properties under section 83 of the CrPc as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-ukhand-hc-sessions-court-too-refuses-relief-to-main-accused-in-kumbh-scam/articleshow/87047481.cms||MS Nawaz

Sidhu told reporters that he had shared his concerns with Rahul and “everything had been sorted out”. AICC general secretary Harish Rawat said, “We have told him that his concerns will be taken care of. He assured Rahul that he has withdrawn his resignation and he will resume his duties as the state president.” Sidhu had earlier resigned in a huff which triggered a row and he was summoned by AICC general secretaries Rawat and K C Venugopal for a meeting on Thursday. Despite Sidhu’s public statement expressing confidence in the Gandhis on Thursday, tension lingered a day later. Well-placed sources said Sidhu was expected to make a public statement on his withdrawal of resignation on Friday. But it did not happen. Even after meeting with Rahul, he did not himself say anything about withdrawing the resignation. Even now, doubts remain if there would be stability in the state Congress given the differences between Sidhu and CM Charanjit Channi over key appointments. Sources indicated that senior party leaders will be discussing the issue with long term in mind given the worries about instability resurfacing. The Gandhi siblings, with whom Sidhu is close, had kept their distance from him during the fresh controversy and he had to deal with AICC managers. “He will have to focus more on organisation and be less emotional in his reactions,“ a party leader said.

Police said that four persons have been identified while two others were unknown. According to Chomu ACP Rajendra Singh, the exact number of assailants has not been determined. The victim, identified as Ramesh Chandra Gurjar, is a resident of Road No. 17 near Badarna. His brother, Rajendra Gurjar, said that Ramesh had earlier run a mobile shop but had recently started working as an agent for a tour and travel company. Family members said that Ramesh had stepped out of the basement of a commercial tower and was standing on the road when some men carrying sticks and rods began thrashing him in full public view on Thursday night. They claimed that Ramesh appeared to be in a stable condition when he was taken to Kanwatia Hospital, but fell unconscious soon after. The doctors ran medical tests and referred him to SMS Hospital for treatment. “We brought him to SMS Hospital at around 12.30am, but he died on Friday morning at about 4am,” Rajendra said. The four suspects identified, so far, are Sonu, Sunny, Irshad and Babu. The family alleged that besides the four accused, there were at least two to three more unknown persons who attacked Ramesh. Police retrieved the CCTV footage from nearby areas to examine how many people were involved in the crime. An FIR has been filed at VKI police station. Police said the reason behind the crime has not been ascertained yet. “Prima facie rivalry or some enmity appears to be the main motive. But we are investigating the case to see what led to the attack,” an officer said. Family members told TOI that Ramesh was married and had two daughters. “We are still in a shock over the manner in which he was killed. We hope the accused are arrested soon,” Rajendra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/travel-agent-beaten-to-death-in-city-4-accused-identified/articleshow/87051050.cms||---

The court was hearing the anticipatory bail plea filed by K S Shanmugakani, S Ramesh Kumar, S Radha Krishnan and K Gururaj of Virudhunagar who are apprehending arrest in a case registered by the Sattur Town police.

Based on Ilangovan’s complaint, a case was registered. A counter complaint was also lodged in connection with the clash, based on which a case was registered against several people including former minister and party’s Virudhunagar west district secretary K T Rajenthra Bhalaji. In the petition, the petitioners stated that they were not involved in any such offence as alleged by the prosecution. They stated that a false case has been registered against them due to political pressure from Bhalaji, since there was a difference of opinion between them.

After the meeting, Raopura police inspector N D Solanki was shunted to the city police control room and another inspector was put in charge of the Raopura police station. Almost all those present at the meeting were also there at the event to kick off the ‘Vishwamiri Parikrama’ held under the aegis of Vaho Vishwamitri Abhiyan. Alleged misbehaviour by Solanki with the mayor Keyur Rokadia at this event was taken up with the city police commissioner Shamsher Singh at the meeting. Solanki had rudely asked mayor Rokadia to move his chair on the dais so that space could be made to ensure social distancing is observed when the police chief arrives. Since there was no more space, the mayor expressed inability to move his chair and said that they would manage when Singh comes. The inspector allegedly misbehaved with Rokadia, who too lost his temper. Solanki was taken away from the place. Sources said that Solanki also spoke curtly to some other BJP leaders sparking a row. “He continued with the behaviour even after some persons told him who I was. There was a genuine problem and it was not possible to move chairs,” said Rokadia. He, however, added that the agenda for the meeting in the afternoon was cattle and not the inspector’s behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pi-shunted-for-alleged-misbehaviour-with-vadodara-city-mayor/articleshow/87049225.cms||---

Each community brought its ceremonial hues to the celebration, composing a harmonious palette of unity in diversity. After two years of sluggish business, jewellers reported robust sales of gold ornaments on Dussehra. Friday’s gold rate was approximately Rs 49,000 per 10gm. Happiness was palpable in the voice of Kumar Jain, vice chairman of the Shree Mumbai Jewellers Association at Zaveri Bazar. He said, “Wedding purchases as well as mahurat purchases have done remarkably well. People, who have been unable to spend money on foreign tours, dining out or shopping in malls during the lockdown, are diverting their savings to gold.” He said, “Customers are buying 5-10gm of gold, which is higher than previous volumes. Our store that would have closed by 8pm will remain open till 10pm because clients have called to say they will arrive to purchase during the late night mahurat.” Another goldsmith, Kanaya Kakad of JK Brothers, Zaveri Bazar, said, “Business was good. People were buying coins and jewellery ranging from 10gm to 50gm. A few 100 gram sets also sold.”  Several buyers were seen trying on ornaments at Waman Hari Pethe in Dadar and at jewellery stores in Thane. The festive spirit overtook the women of Durga Puja pandals across Bandra, Andheri Lokhandwala, Shivaji Park, Navi Mumbai and Thane who celebrated Sindoor Khela dressed in the classic Bengali white and red sari. South Indian, particularly Tamilian households, display an array of Golu dolls through the nine days ofNavratra. In Maitri Park, Chembur, Revathi Sridhar installed a beautiful tableau of handmade dolls. She said, “These dolls are assembled by body parts. The face is madeof fibre glass, the body is of cotton and the limbs are detachable. So I can mould the dolls into a reclining, sitting or standing pose.”  Cricketers in Shivaji Park adorned their bats and stumps with floral garlands. Artisans worship the toolsof their trade at Dussehra. Ravan Dahan was less visible this year but temples completed the final recitation of the Ramkatha or Ramayan ‘paath’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-brisk-sale-of-gold-brings-festive-lustre-to-dussehra/articleshow/87051059.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

Farmers also burnt the effigies of several other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and also the faces of two corporate houses. Farmers raised slogans against the government and demanded repeal of three agri-marketing laws and a law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP). In Kurukshetra, the effigies of leaders were burnt in all blocks of the district at Ambedkar Chowk in Ladwa, Sunria Chowk in Babain, at Umri Langar in Thanesar, old grain market at Pehowa, at grain market gate in Ismailabad and HUDA police post at Shahabad. In Ambala, the farmers burnt the effigies of BJP leaders at Lakhnaur Sahib, Shahzadpur, Korwa Khurd and many other villages of the district. The protests by the farmers remained peaceful and no untoward incident was reported. In Karnal, activists of BKU (Charuni) also burnt the effigy of Haryana deputy CM Dushyant Chautala. Hundreds of farmers from nearby villages reached Committee Chowk of Karnal. They carried out a protest march in the city while chanting slogans against the BJP-JJP government and demanding withdrawal of the agriculture laws. Bhadur Singh Mehla, a local BKU (Charuni) leader, said, "Today, we burnt effigies of BJP leaders who brought these back laws. Hundreds of farmers sacrificed their lives during this farmer’s agitation. The government will have to listen to the voice of the people." BKU Charuni spokesman Rakesh Kumar Bains said, "For society and farmers, the biggest Ravan today are the rulers of the country who are ignoring the legitimate demands of farmers due to arrogance and stubborn attitude. More than 700 farmers have lost their lives, but the rulers have not broken their silence." In Jind, farm activists described BJP-JJP leaders as “kisano kay Ravan” (Ravan for farmers). They held protests at villages in the district to burn effigies. Farmers erected statues in villages with the faces of Modi, Khattar and Dushyant Chautala and burnt them after holding protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-dussehra-farm-groups-burn-modi-shah-effigies-in-haryana/articleshow/87051580.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘BJP corporator’s nomination form deserved to be rejected’||MUMBAI: The nomination form of BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde deserved to be rejected by the returning officer (RO), who “wrongly accepted it”, held additional Chief Judge P R Chaudhari of Small Causes Court. He set aside his 2017 civic election to BMC as “void’’.  The court held that a Mulund resident and voter of ward 106 proved that Shinde filed an “incorrect affidavit’’ and “concealed’’ details, and gave an “incomplete’’ description of movable/immovable property and criminal cases. The election was held on February 21, 2017. The court had on Thursday allowed an election plea filed in 2017 by businessman Bharghav Kadam (47), whose counsel Balkrishna Joshi argued that Shinde “misled’’ voters by giving “incomplete information’’ and disclosure on affidavit. The judge said, “Once the nomination form is rejected, his election from ward 106 is liable to be set aside.’’ Joshi had argued that Shinde suppressed mandatory information, including an ambulance belonging to him, which voters had a right to know, and the description of immovable property was “faulty’’, rendering the affidavit “substantially” defective. He mentioned a property, but not its square footage, he said, and cited Supreme Court judgments to argue that an affidavit and disclosure of assets and cases was not a mere formality. Advocate for BMC D A Tayshete and Shinde’s lawyer R K Mendadkar denied illegality in the RO accepting his form. Shinde said he gave detailed information on his property and of pending cases in the affidavit in prescribed format. Shinde said the plea was filed with political motive, “to harass” him, at the instance of Shiv Sena. The court, during hearing, framed five questions and answered all in the affirmative, in the judgment. The questions included whether the petitioner proved that Shinde “suppressed full and complete information of his and his dependant’s movable/immovable properties, assets, vehicles, criminal cases and directorships in companies as required... in the affidavit? If it was proved that the RO improperly accepted the form, and if the petitioner proved that Shinde “misled voters’’, and if Shinde’s election was liable to be set aside, as sought. The petitioner said Shinde was a director of a company which has property in Lower Parel, which was not disclosed on affidavit. The court observed, “It is not a formality to give information about property in the name of candidate and criminal records of the candidate. Voters have the right to get fair knowledge about it before voting.’’ The judgement said that if any person did not give correct information about himself in the affidavit and submitted it as a formality, he should be dealt with an ‘iron hand’ by ignoring the fact that mandate of people is going to be set aside by the court. Advocate Jeet Gandhi said he will move HC next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-corporators-nomination-form-deserved-to-be-rejected/articleshow/87049163.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nashik||Ruling, opposition parties must focus on commoners, says Pankaja||Aurangabad: Pankaja Munde, BJP national secretary, while addressing the annual Dasara rally at Savargaon village in Beed district on Friday, asked the ruling and the opposition parties to work for the betterment of commoners. “Every day, the opposition claims to bring the ruling government down, while the ruling government asserts that the government is stable. The parties need to get out of this mindset and start working together for the commoners,” Pankaja said. For the last 2 years, the gathering was being held online due to covid. Pankaja urged the opposition to work as opposition and asked the Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to carry forward his father’s legacy and by taking pro-people steps. Without naming her estranged cousin, she accused him of renting out his ministry. “Whether in power or not, I will continue to be with you. I do not have anyone except you people,” said Pankaja, while addressing her supporters. From next month, Pankaja said, she will visit every village and sugarcane farm and asserted that the schemes started by her are still benefiting the commoners. While speaking on the reservation issue, the minister reiterated that she will continue to fight for Maratha and OBC reservations. She said that she stands by her pledge and won’t wear garlands and traditional turban respectively till Maratha and OBC reservation issue is addressed. She alleged that conspiracies are being played to bring a rift between Maratha and OBC communities across the state, and urged the people to not fall prey to such tricks. She said that the MVA parties are working hard to make each other happy, instead of working for the people. The packages announced for the state are insufficient as covid has already caused havoc on the lives of commoners and added said that the money sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reaching the bank accounts of the people, but money sent by the state or district guardian minister is not. After paying obeisance at Bhagwad Bhaktigad, Pankaja took off in a helicopter to reach the venue but had to return due to lack of clearance from the authorities. However, after the clearance was given later, Pankaja reached the venue along with her sister and MP Preetam. Meanwhile, a group of supporters tried to enter the security area in front of the stage but were stopped by the police. Angered over it, they pelted stones on the cops on duty. Noticing the chaos, Pankaja intervened and brought the situation under control. Till late, the police officers refused to comment if any offence was being registered into the stone-pelting incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ruling-opposition-parties-must-focus-on-commoners-says-pankaja/articleshow/87046228.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Several events marked the celebrations that began with prayers offered by his kin at the memorial in Rameswaram. Around 5,000 people visited his memorial. It was followed by homage paid by officials from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and officials from the Ramanathapuram district administration and the district police. Visitors to the memorial were given sweets when they entered the memorial and a sapling when they left to fulfil Kalam’s vision of creating a greener India. Meanwhile, governor of Tamil Nadu R N Ravi paid a floral tribute to Kalam at his statue in Raj Bhavan, Chennai. The governor remembered the determined sacrifices of Kalam throughout his life for the scientific community and towards the nation’s development. Chief minister M K Stalin in a message said that we should pledge to destroy poverty, which Kalam considered the enemy of India. Political leaders including AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran and MNM president Kamal Haasan remembered the former president on his birth anniversary. “He showed the people that one could achieve great levels through hard work in an honest way and showed the path for the nation to move. He was instrumental in pushing lakhs of Indians towards their ambitious goals. After Gandhi, Kalam is another father of the nation that we have been bestowed with,” Kamal Haasan said in a tweet. “He went on to create history and became the most loved President,” said Dhinakaran in his tweet. “He was the best example for a person to dream and relentlessly work towards achieving it,” recalled Dhinakaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/thousands-visit-abdul-kalams-memorial-on90th-birth-anniv/articleshow/87051090.cms||---

The court refused to accept the chargesheet on the 60th day, stating that police have filed it after the accused submitted a bail application, and said that he was entitled to default bail. The special judge under Pocso, Kalpana Patil, granted bail to the accused, arrested on charges of 354, 509 and Pocso on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 15,000 and on the condition that he shall not tamper with prosecution witnesses or victim, and shall not leave the country without court permission. This pertains to a complaint lodged by a minor girl’s parents that the accused, who used to treat their child as his daughter, allegedly touched the victim inappropriately twice. Based on the complaint, Colaba police arrested him on August 10 and he was remanded to judicial custody. But the prosecution submitted a token number stating that they were submitting the chargesheet only on October 10. Advocate Sunil Pandey told the court that his client has been falsely implicated in the case as the victim’s family wanted to trap him as he allegedly failed to pay them the money they had demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/default-bail-for-senior-citizen-in-pocso-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/87049209.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Dehradun||Potholes, damaged roads daily struggle for Doon residents||Dehradun: Several major and inner-city roads in the city are pothole-ridden and even the patchwork undertaken by civic bodies after multiple complaints is shoddy, say residents. They add that potholes are often just covered with gravel. “There are dilapidated roads in almost every locality of the city. No matter how many times we raise our concerns, no concrete step is taken to fix the issue. Sometimes, cursory repair work is carried out but that,too, holds only for a short time,” said Yesh Veer Arya, a city resident. Residents add that with the start of Smart City projects in the city, blame-game has become easier than ever for civic officials. “Departments point fingers at each other and the buck stops nowhere. There are spots at Dilaram Chowk and Rajpur Road where the cycle of digging and then repatching goes on for the entire year,” said Rajesh Mohan, owner of a garments shop in the Rajpur Road locality. Echoing a similar sentiment, Mangu Singh, a roadside vendor near ISBT, told TOI, “I have been running my business here for three years now and the condition of the road has remained dilapidated throughout. There have been times when motorists have lost balance and met with minor accidents due to the poor condition of the roads here.” A spot visit reveals uneven roads and shoddy patchwork at Subhash Road, Pant Road, Doon Hospital Chowk, Darshni Gate Market and other places causing inconvenience to locals. Meanwhile, the public works department (PWD) claimed that repair work is carried out as and when they receive a complaint. “When people reach out to us with such complaints, either physically or virtually, we take immediate action and carry out repair work. In the last few months, we have undertaken repair work at Dehradun-Mussoorie road, DL Road, Karanpur, Mohini, EC Road, and Lambidhar state highway, among others,” said DC Nautiyal, executive engineer, PWD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/potholes-damaged-roads-daily-struggle-for-doon-residents/articleshow/87047548.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Goa||Goa sees highest sex trafficking: Report||PANAJI: The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report for 2020 has highlighted that sex trafficking in Goa is 1.1%, which is the highest (per capita population) in the country. In a bid to reduce the demand for commercial sexual activities, the Goa State Legal Service Authority (GSLSA), in collaboration with Arz (Anyay Rahit Zindagi), is organising an awareness programme at Calangute beach aimed at educating tourists and members of the hospitality industry. “We have been actively involved in the rescue of the girls and now even the NCRB figures show that the highest number of cases per capita population have been registered in Goa by police, despite the pandemic. What is surprising, however, is that the conviction is zero,” said Arun Pandey, director of Arz. As per the NCRB report in 2020, there were 17 cases of sex trafficking registered in Goa. There were 30 girls rescued and chargesheet was filed in 95.2% cases. Cases acquitted were only two and cases convicted were zero. “We need to therefore talk about not just the trafficked girls, but also the clients – especially those that are domestic tourists. The members of the hospitality industry are aware about it but are not raising alarm or sharing information about the same. We are therefore holding the awareness programme at Calangute – a place, where as per our experience of rescuing trafficked girls, many girls are exploited,” Pandey said. Students of Carmel College will hold a street performance during the awareness drive, documentaries will be screened, and youth will be encouraged to speak at the drive addressing the issue. Besides urging tourists to refrain from engaging in the crime, the GSLSA and Arz will also appeal to the hospitality industry to avoid directly or indirectly abetting this crime. They will hold a similar awareness drive on October 19 at Colva, Margao. As per the NCRB report in 2020, 17 cases of sex trafficking registered in Goa.

Police had to resort to diverting traffic in many sections. Madurai, like other parts of the state, is witnessing a frenzied Diwali shopping after about a year. Being a holiday, the traffic congestion was huge on Friday in many parts of the city especially, East Masi Street. Two-wheelers were seen parked haphazardly near the pavements in many places in two rows, making the movement of vehicles very difficult on narrow roads such as East Masi Street and South Masi Street. “Pavements of these roads are a step above the road level, forcing many people to park their vehicles on roads,” said S Chelladurai, a teacher. He said that the situation would be worse next week, when schools also start functioning. “We should always keep in mind that it was the festive shopping during last year’s Onam in Kerala, which had led to the spike in cases in the state. It would be good if traffic police enforced the Covid protocols during the festival season,” said V P Manikandan, a social activist. K Padmanaban, a shopper, said that he had become concerned about the crowds, and the lack of Covid SOPs in many of the overcrowded textile shops. Hawkers and street vendors should be shifted to the less crowded roads during the festival season, said Sudharshan of Simmakkal. Cars and other bigger vehicles coming from Kamarajar Salai towards Periyar bus stand were diverted through East Veli Street, instead of the South Masi street on Friday, but it did not help ease the traffic much. Deputy commissioner, traffic, I Easwaran said they are planning some experimental route changes this Sunday, and will allow vehicles through the Nethaji Road. “As the entire stretch has one-way traffic, we have to ensure free flow of traffic, and we should not inconvenience people,” he said. The deputy commissioner said that they would also consider not allowing street vendors who use tricycles on the busy roads till the festival is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/diwali-shopping-chokes-commercial-streets-in-madurai-after-nearly-a-year/articleshow/87051094.cms||Padmini Sivarajah
---||Mumbai||Unearthed Rs 184 crore in benami deals after raids at premises linked to Ajit Pawar’s kin, 2 Mumbai-based builders: I-T||MUMBAI: The income-tax investigation wing has unearthed unaccounted and benami transactions worth Rs 184 crore during the October 7 searches at the premises of deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s son and sisters, two Mumbai builders and their associates. The I-T department, in a press note on Friday, claimed the suspicious funds flow took place with the involvement of “an influential family of Maharashtra”. Though it did not name Ajit Pawar, I-T sources said the reference was to his family, D B Realty group and Dynamix group. The I-T department claimed the tainted funds had been used to buy an office building at a prime locality in Mumbai, a flat in a posh Delhi area, a Goa resort, and farm lands in Maharashtra, besides making investments in sugar mills. The book value of the assets aggregates to Rs 170 crore, the note said. I-T dept detected suspicious deals related to Parth Pawar’s co: SourcesSources in the income-tax department said that they had detected suspicious transactions related to Ananta Merx Pvt Ltd, the company of Ajit Pawar’s son Parth, which was incorporated last year with its registered office address being Nirmal Building at Nariman Point. On October 7, I-T officials had searched Ananta Merx along with 70 other premises in Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa and Jaipur and seized more than Rs 2.1 crore in unaccounted cash and jewellery worth Rs 4.3 crore. Reacting to the searches, Ajit Pawar had then said the raid was politically motivated and the Centre was misusing government agencies and resorting to low-level politics. On Wednesday, Ajit’s uncle and NCP chief Sharad Pawar had claimed that central agencies were being blatantly misused to destabilise the MVA government led by Uddhav Thackeray. “The CBI, ED, NCB and I-T department have been pressed into service… So far, it was targeting MVA leaders… now these agencies are targeting relatives of top leaders of the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena,” he had said. The I-T department on Friday said, “The search action has led to the identification of transactions by these business groups (builders) with a web of companies which, prima facie, appear to be suspicious. A preliminary analysis of the flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious meth-ods like introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes. It has been observed that such suspicious flow of funds has taken place with the involvement of an influential family of Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-t-dept-detected-suspicious-deals-related-to-parth-pawars-co-says-sources/articleshow/87049214.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin writes to CMs of four states to lift ban on fireworks sale; Rajasthan responds||VIRUDHUNAGAR: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin has written to his counterparts in four states, urging them to consider lifting the blanket ban on fireworks during this Diwali. He said the ban would set a bad precedent to other states with less than three weeks left for the festival and affect the livelihood of eight lakh employees in Virudhunagar district. In the letter to the chief ministers of Delhi, Odisha, Rajasthan and Haryana, Stalin stated that the Covid-19 pandemic had a crippling effect on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector in the country. Tamil Nadu’s economy, largely dependent on the MSME sector for growth and employment, was significantly affected, he stated. Responding to his request, the Rajasthan government withdrew the ban on Friday evening. Stalin thanked Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot for his prompt response over his letter and lifting the blanket ban on the sale of firecrackers. “Your kind act will light up the lives of lakhs of people who are dependent on this industry for their livelihood,” Stalin told Gehlot. In his letter, Stalin had said that the state government is now in the process of reviving the sector through focused interventions. He stated said that the firecracker industry concentrated around Sivakasi town in Virudhunagar district is the largest fireworks producer in India. “It has been brought to my notice that your government has imposed a ban on the sale of firecrackers during this festival season (Diwali-2021),” Stalin stated in the letter and added that he can understand that the decision has been taken by them based on concerns regarding air pollution. Stalin stated that the Supreme Court has banned certain categories of polluting firecrackers and now, green crackers with significantly less emissions are being manufactured. “A blanket ban on firecrackers is not reasonable. Such a ban is not prevalent in other countries,” he said. The CM added that such a ban if imposed by other states also would lead to the closure of the entire industry, jeopardizing the livelihood of around eight lakh people. He pressed for a balanced approach that gives due regard to environment, livelihood and public health. He urged the state governments to reconsider the blanket ban on sale of firecrackers and permit sale of firecrackers that falls within the norms set by the apex court and the National Green Tribunal. Later that day Stalin thanked Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot for his prompt response over his letter and lifting the blanket ban on the sale of firecrackers. "Your kind act will light up the lives of lakhs of people who are dependent on this industry for their livelihood," Stalin added. Cracker manufacturers thanked the CM and industries minister Thangam Thennarasu for their efforts. Speaking to TOI, president of the Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association (TANFAMA) P Ganesan said that all these four states had imposed the ban despite manufacturers making green crackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stalin-writes-to-cms-of-4-states-to-lift-fireworks-ban-rajasthan-responds/articleshow/87051100.cms||---
---||Madurai||Temples open on weekends in 5 months to low footfall||Madurai/Trichy: After the state government allowed public worship at temples on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, temples managed by the HR&CE opened across the state on Friday after nearly five months. Though the footfall was low in the morning, many temples saw larger crowds in the evening, flouting Covid-19 safety norms at many places. The queues at Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple in Madurai were small in the morning. As the government’s decision was announced on Thursday, many were not aware of the opening. “It came as a surprise, and I took the first bus available, and came to the Meenakshi temple,” said Packialakshmi from Melur, who had wanted to get her daughter’s wedding invitation blessed at the temple on a Friday. But in the evening, Meenakshi temple witnessed big crowds. Though security frisking was in place, other Covid protocols such as sanitization and social distancing were not followed. No thermal scanning was done at the entrance, according to K Thiagarajan who visited the temple on Friday. In Trichy and the other districts in the central region, the footfall was low on Friday. “We anticipated a surge in footfall, but it was the other way,” an HR&CE official at the Samayapuram Arulmigu Mariamman temple, Trichy, said. Other temples including Srirangam, Thiruvanaikoil and Rockfort temple complex saw average turnout too. In Srirangam Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple, the HR&CE department anticipates the footfall to increase on Saturday and Sunday. “Visitors may increase on Saturday as it will be the auspicious Purattasi month’s last Saturday,” an HR&CE official at Srirangam temple said. While Srirangam temple allows devotees to enter via three major entrances, the Samayapuram temple is allowing devotees only though the southern gopuram, while the western gopuram serves as the exit. HR&CE officials added that all the entry points of the temples were manned to ensure facemasks compliance as well as to check the body temperature of the visitors. The Rameswaram Sri Ramanathaswamy temple, which is a destination for pilgrims during long weekends, also saw a low footfall. Temple sources said that the crowds were expected to increase during the weekend. Meanwhile, the public are asked to ensure that they are wearing masks while entering the temples. Thiruparankundram Subramaniaswamy temple also saw large crowds in the evening. Palani Dandayudhapani temple saw a comparatively smaller crowd than usual. “There are rituals people perform on Fridays, so the crowds would be much larger next Friday,” said a temple source. Parents of children who were to get their children admitted to schools, were happy with the reopening of temples. The Sidhapudhur Ayyappan temple in Coimbatore saw a large number of people bringing their children for the Vidhyarambam. Meanwhile, temple employees said that monitoring all the devotees as per the SOPs will not be possible in the coming days, when the Sabarimala season begins.

Sola police registered a case under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobeying order by public servant) for violation of the police commissioner’s notification against organizing garbas. Sub-inspector J J Rana, the complainant, stated that he was on patrol when he got information about garba being held at a coffee bar. He stated that he reached Grace Coffee Bar at about 11.20pm. Rana stated that he and his team went in there were some 500 people there, in traditional dress and playing garba. Rana then asked for the police permission but the person managing the coffee bar stated that they did not have any. Thus the owners had organised a garba for about 500 people without permission. Thus the organizing of a commercial garba was a violation of the police commissioner notification. Police registered a case against Chandramoli alias Dilip Patel, 37, a resident of Gandhinagar, Naresh alias Yash Dhakhan, 37, a resident of Satellite and Jasmin Sisodiya, 26, a resident of Shilaj.

The two friends in the car suffered injuries and were rushed to the hospital. Police identified them as Yash Shah and his cousin Tirth. N division traffic police inspector B B Vaghela said the accident took place at 2.30am on Friday and they have registered a case of negligent driving and are investigating further. The cops said at about 2.30am, Yash, who was driving and is about 20 years old, lost control over the vehicle and hit the railing of the BRTS corridor, after which the car turned turtle. The two occupants of the car suffered only minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital on Friday evening. Vaghela said the accident probably occurred after Yash probably nodded off to sleep while driving. The car is registered in the name of Yash’s father. Police are yet to arrest Yash. They do not know why the youths were out at 2.30am while there is a midnight curfew in force in the city. A senior police official said the accident took place 50m away from Shivranjani bus stand towards Nehrunagar. The official said that had the vehicle veered to the left, a tragedy would have occurred as people were sleeping on the footpath there. In another incident that occurred near Hansol late on Thursday night, a woman was rushed to hospital after she was hit by a speeding car. She was flung 15 feet away by the impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shivranjani-crash-injures-2-car-overturns/articleshow/87049249.cms||---

This is the second ‘encounter’ by state police in a week. A 28-year-old man from Jharkhand, who had allegedly snatched a chain from a woman near Sriperumbudur in Kancheepuram district, was killed in an ‘encounter’ earlier this week. The superintendent of police (SP) of Tuticorin district denied that Friday’s incident was an encounter. He claimed that the history-sheeter, V Duraimurugan, 40, was killed when police fired at him in self-defense when he attacked two cops with a machete. Duraimurugan of Koottaampuli near Pudukottai is the prime accused in the murder of M Jegadeesh, 23, of Sivagamipuram near Pavoorchatram in Tenkasi district on October 6. Duraimurugan and his accomplices abducted Jegadeesh following a clash that arose between the two a couple of days prior to the murder. Sixteen cut injuries were inflicted on the youth before he was buried in Tirunelveli city. The body was exhumed earlier this week and a search was launched for the accused. “We launched a search for Duraimurugan as he is from our district,” SP Jayakumar told reporters after visiting the encounter scene on Friday afternoon. The SP’s special team led by sub inspector Raja Prabhu got information that Duraimurugan along with two of his associates were in a hideout at Kovalam near Muthiahpuram. Jayakumar said that the SI was accompanied by three constables when they spotted Duraimurugan. “While his two accomplices fled, constable David Raja was chasing the history-sheeter. After running for about 50 meters he turned back to attack David Raja with a machete, landing a cut on the left hand of the constable,” the SP said and added that it was then the SI fired into the air and asked Duraimurugan to surrender. “But the history sheeter attacked Raja Prabhu with the machete and inflicted a cut on his left hand. As self-defense the SI fired three rounds at Duraimurugan. The accused was sent to the Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. His body has been kept at the hospital for autopsy,” the SP said. Police said that the SI had six bullets in his official 9mm pistol of which four were fired – a warning shot and three on the history sheeter. The injured police constable and SI were admitted to a hospital. The SP who inquired about the incident said that the duo was in a state of shock. Cases in eight districts Jayakumar said that Duraimurugan has cases in eight districts including Madurai, Tuticorin, Tiruvannamalai, Nagapattinam, Kanyakumari, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram over a period of two decades. In Madurai he has cases in Oomachikulam, Othakadai, Perungudi, Anna Nagar, S S Colony and Teppakulam police stations. Most of his murders were abduction, followed by brutal murders. According to police, Duraimurugan is also known for landing in trouble for eve-teasing. He is an accused in the murder of Srinivasan in 2001, T Selvam, Rajinikanth and Stalin of Tuticorin in separate incidents in 2003, Balamurugan of Tiruvannamali in 2010, Manimozhi, 44, near Othakadai in Madurai in 2011 and Jegadeesh of Tenkasi earlier this month. After spending nearly three-and-a-half years in jail he was released on September 3. The 28 other cases against him include 21 robberies, six thefts and an attempt to murder. The SP said that special teams are on the lookout of two of Duraimurugan’s accomplices who fled the scene on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-gun-down-history-sheeter-wanted-in-35-cases/articleshow/87051114.cms||---

Merchant, 26, who has no criminal antecedents, was arrested by the NCB along with Khan on October 3. “There is no evidence inter- se between any of the accused as they were all admittedly travelling individually and not collectively,’’ said his bail plea. The NCB case is that it recovered 6 gram of charas from Merchant when its officers saw him and Khan at the terminal. His lawyer argued that even if the “alleged recovery’’ is considered by court as “an independent recovery’’ of small quantity, the punishment for which is maximum six months or fine, and section 64A of NDPS Act allows for immunity from prosecution too and hence bail ought to be granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-ncb-case-that-arbaaz-consumed-or-sold-charas/articleshow/87049259.cms||---

The minister added that the cost of electricity production will come down only when the production is 85%. He also said that efforts are on to increase the production of solar power to 4,000 MW, restudy the projects for increasing production by 6,200 MW that was initiated by the DMK government from 2006 to 2011 and ignored by the successive AIADMK governments and reduce wastage of electricity from the current 17.48%. Talking about the difference in coal shortage that is being studied by a committee, he said that the difference in records and actuals in Tuticorin was 71,000 tonnes.

With the day being auspicious for both the Hindus and Muslims, they seemed happy with the government’s decision to select the day to lift the ban. Temples were almost crowded as it was the day for ‘vidyarambham’ - a ritual on the occasion of Vijayadashami to formally introduce children to the world of learning. Children were guided to write the Tamil alphabet ‘A’ using the index finger of their right hand. Many parents thronged Sidhapudur Ayyappan temple with their children for the ‘vidyarambham’. Devotees were also seen in large numbers at Subramanya Swamy temple at Maruthamalai, Sri Vana Badrakaliamman Temple at Thekkampatti and Masaniamman temple at Anaimalai. “It is a general belief that if we begin education or artform on Vijayadashami, it will lead to success,” said S Vineeth, a parent who came with his three-year-old son. Special prayers were organized in mosques too on the day. Mosques at Kottaimedu, Athupalam, Townhall and Uppilipalayam recorded a large footfall. Puja sessions were organized in many private schools in the city as well by reciting shlokas and the newly admitted kids were made to write on rice and paddy grains. The day also saw many city schools admitting children to the entry level. However, the response was lukewarm for the second consecutive year because of the pandemic. Mayadevi Shankar, state president, All Private Schools’ Welfare Association, confirmed the response to the admission process was poor. “While schools are set to reopen in November, parents are sceptical about paying the fees fearing another closure of schools if there is a spike in Covid cases in the coming months.” District chief education officer N Geetha said 121 students were enrolled in government and aided schools on the day. “The highest number of 78 students were admitted to Class I, while 22 students joined UKG and 21 LKG.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/places-of-worship-reopen-for-devotees-on-weekends-draw-large-footfall-on-1st-day/articleshow/87051123.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This year, so far, a total of 291 dengue cases have been reported, of which 18 were recorded in September and October. “There are dengue cases being reported but it is not alarming. We have intensified control and preventive measures in areas based on fever cases being reported even if it is not dengue. Fever surveillance is being closely monitored but there is no abnormal rise in fever cases too,” said a health official. At the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), out of the total 33 dengue cases, 10 have been treated in September and October. “We haven’t had any severe case of dengue as of yet. Usually by October, we see rise in dengue cases but after 2018, dengue spread has been largely under control in Madurai. We are prepared as well in case of any rise in cases. A 40-bedded dengue ward is functional and our blood bank is also equipped to provide platelets,” said Dr M Natarajan, head, department of general medicine, GRH. Last year, especially with lockdown in place and educational institutions closed, there were less dengue cases between September and November. Interestingly, more dengue cases were reported in the rural areas compared to urban areas this year, but this year more cases are reported in urban areas. Out of the 291 dengue cases this year, 161 were in corporation areas while 130 were in rural areas. “Dengue cases tend to see rise depending on the monsoon rains. We have to wait and see how the trend is. The increase in cases this year is mainly because dengue cases in 2020 monsoon season peaked only by December and January 2021,” said the health official. More than 1000 DBCs across Madurai district are engaged in day-to-day dengue preventive activities, including anti-larval work, removing sources of mosquito-breeding in residential areas, spraying of abate solution and bleach etc., Those with symptoms of dengue, which include high fever, headache, rashes, muscle and joint pain etc., have been asked to immediately consult a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dengue-cases-under-radar-in-madurai-dist/articleshow/87051136.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Inspector Khetmalas said that the seized marijuana appears to have been planted three months back and it was ready for harvest. “To hide the marijuana plants, the suspect had planted them in patches with tur dal (pigeon pea crop).” The locals have claimed that the suspect has been allegedly farming marijuana for the past couple of years, without knowledge of police or revenue authorities said an officer. The suspect would sow marijuana in small patches along with crops having an appearance similar to that of marijuana.

Till the marriage is registered, the court has ordered the authorities to keep the woman at the Women’s Shelter Home at Paldi in Ahmedabad and to not allow anybody to meet her without her consent. On the day of the registration of the marriage, police have been ordered to escort her to the registrar’s office and to ensure that no untoward incident takes place and the marriage is registered. In this case, the man is from the Hindu community and the woman is Muslim. The high court was approached by the man last year seeking to release the woman he intends to marry from the custody of her family. He complained that the woman’s family did not allow them to meet. In his petition, the man claimed that they knew each other for past two years and decided to get married. They applied for marriage registration, but when they went to the registrar’s office, they found a group of people who were opposed to their marriage. They had to flee the registrar’s office without registration of their marriage. He also submitted that after fleeing the registrar’s office, they began to live together. They informed Karanj police about their living together, but the woman’s family members later separated them. The high court summoned the woman on October 8 and found that her version of the story was similar. The woman refused to go back to her parents’ house and chose to stay at the shelter home. The high court heard the couple again on Tuesday and decided to provide protection to the couple for the marriage registration process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-interfaith-couple/articleshow/87049366.cms||---

The organisers of Dussehra celebrations at Race Course — which was one of the biggest events held in the city on the day — said that they witnessed a turnout higher than expected. Santosh Nagpal, media coordinator of the Dussehra committee, told TOI, “In view of the Covid-19 protocols, we just burnt a symbolic effigy but a large number of people showed up at the event.” Several Ramlilas in the city also focused on low-key and environment-friendly celebrations and effigy burnings. Meanwhile, locals in Udpalta and Kuroli villages in the Jaunsar Bawar region continued with the tradition of a symbolic fight in honour of two sisters Rani and Munni who had died on Dussehra day over 100 years ago. The tradition, known as Painta, in which the effigies of the two sisters are immersed in the river and a symbolic fight known as Gagli is held between groups of villagers in order to pray for peace and prosperity in the area, saw a huge turnout this year. According to folklore, a curse was cast on the villages after the death of the sister duo and it will only be lifted when a girl child is born on the day of Dussehra in each of the two villages. "A pitra pujan ceremony is held at the well where the two girls drowned. Subsequently, a cultural event is organised in the village. Last year, we didn't observe the tradition of a symbolic fight due to the pandemic but this year, locals from the villages participated in the mock fight," said Gambhir Singh, the head of Kuroli village where the event was held this year.

The sarpanch said during the joint meeting a fair discussion was had and plans would be submitted as early as possible. Another meeting will be held next week to settle the issue. “Our MLA has assured us that once the issue is settled, then within one month he would lay the foundation stone for the market,” added Naik.

---||Coimbatore||Colleges urge UGC to lower eligibility criteria for teachers||Coimbatore: Self-financing arts and science colleges want the University Grants Commission (UGC) to relax the eligibility criteria for teachers in the undergraduate-level. As of now, the National Eligibility Test (NET)/ State-level Eligibility Test (SLET) or PhD is the basic eligibility for teaching in arts and science colleges. Representatives of the college said they are struggling to appoint teachers in the undergraduate-level over want of teachers with NET/SLET or PhD. They want UGC to make postgraduation with first class as basic eligibility. On Wednesday, UGC extended the mandatory requirement of PhD for teaching in colleges and universities by two more years till 2023, considering the pandemic. Three years ago, the Union government said that a PhD degree will be a must from the 2021-21 academic year. While NET/SLET will now be the basic eligibility criteria, the Association of Self-financing Arts, Science and Management College of Tamil Nadu (ASFASMTN) urged the UGC to make postgraduation as minimum eligible to teach undergraduate students in colleges. “It is not possible to appoint teachers with NET/SLET and PhD in all arts and science colleges as we don’t have the required number of eligible candidates,” ASFASMTN president Ajeet Kumar Lal Mohan said. “Only a few students pass NET or SLET every year and many subjects are yet to be added in the NET and SLET. Without rectifying such issues, rules cannot be made mandatory,” he said. “While teachers ideally should possess PhD and NET/SLET for teaching postgraduate students or at the research level, it may not be required for teaching in the undergraduate level.” A representative said the colleges are denied affiliation to new courses of Bharathiar University, citing lack of teachers with PhD.  “But the university itself could not fill vacant faculty positions due to lack of qualified teachers and it has been hiring guest faculty members. There cannot be double standards for colleges and universities,” Ajeet added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/colleges-urge-ugc-to-lower-eligibility-criteria-for-teachers/articleshow/87051186.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The deceased has been identified as Mohammad Alam (23), a resident of Canal Road. As per offence registered with police, at 10.30 am on Tuesday, an iron rod fell on Alam following which he was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to the injury. Construction of building was underway along Canal Road under the Gangapur police station jurisdiction. “The work of carrying iron rods manually from the ground to the seventh floor was underway. The rods were tied to a rope and pulled up on the seventh floor of the building,” a police officer said. While the work of lifting the rods was underway, a rod slipped from the bundle and pierced into Alam’s chest. He was rushed to a private hospital where he died. Police booked construction supervisor and a few others of the real estate firm for causing death due to negligence. “Some machine like an elevator or a protective net should have been used by the officers of the concerned company to lift the iron rods to the seventh floor,” a police officer said. “Since they overlooked the safety precautions, they have been booked for causing death due to negligence. The case is being investigated further,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/supervisor-booked-for-workers-death/articleshow/87046341.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: EOW arrests two for duping octogenarian couple of over Rs 5 crore||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has arrested two website designers for allegedly duping an octogenarian couple of Rs 5.2 crore on the pretext of high returns on investments. The accused have been identified as Ankit Thakur (29) and Vinod Arya (28). According to police, the duo ran a company— Ecounsellor Webtech Private Limited—to dupe people. The victim couple wanted to settle in the USA with their children who are already employed and settled there. The immovable properties acquired during the lifetime had to be sold by them for this purpose. During this, they came in contact with the accused people who induced them through a rosy presentation of very high returns for investing the money of these sale proceeds in their company. The post-dated cheques issued to the victim couple, cops said, were dishonoured and further, the accused people taking advantage of blindness of the victim husband—a retired senior government servant with the ministry of labour—replaced the original cheques with bogus ones. Despite repeated demands, the money so duped was not returned and consequently misappropriated. An FIR was then filed based on a complaint from the couple. A team led by DCP K Ramesh started tracking the suspects and apprehended the accused. “They have been taken on police custody remand and further investigation in the case is underway,” the DCP said. The accused duo dropped out after Class XII and launched the company for website development. “However, this firm was used to siphon off the money. Both are the directors and authorised signatories of this company wherein the payments received from the victims were deposited,” the officer further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eow-arrests-two-for-duping-octogenarian-couple-of-over-rs-5cr/articleshow/87049479.cms||---

Shekhar said earlier thefts and house break-ins, dacoities used to take place in the rural areas between 11 pm to 2 pm. Hence the police patrolling used to be more intense during these hours. However, with the changing times, people in the rural areas started staying awake till late at night and beyond 12 am. On this backdrop, criminals too changed their modus of committing thefts and dacoities. He said it has been observed that criminals have started committing crimes between 2 am and 5 pm when citizens in the rural areas are asleep. This is also the same time when the patrolling teams also slow down. Against this backdrop, the SPs of all the five units — Nashik rural, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar — have been instructed to keep separate teams for patrolling. While a set of teams would patrol their respective jurisdictions between 10 pm and 2.30 am, their counterpart teams would patrol the same areas from 2 am to 5 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rural-police-to-intensify-patrolling-post-2-am/articleshow/87046355.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Talking to TOI, he said the daily caseload has been fluctuating between 40 and 60 in the past one week, compared to 60-80 some 10 days ago. “On many days, the city logs only fewer than 50 cases.” The officer said while the cases had come down, they hadn’t compromised on the number of tests a day, when 5,500 to 6,000 samples are collected for testing. He said they were collecting a fine of Rs 50,000 a day from the traders and the public, who violate the face mask etiquette and social distancing norms. While the city corporation was still conducting fever surveillance camps daily, it had cut down on the contract workers involved in the same to 500 from October. The civic body had deployed 3,000 workers for the fever camps when the pandemic was at its peak. Another source with the corporation’s health wing said the increased vigil on Kerala-Tamil Nadu border had helped bring down the number of cases in the city. The source said the health minister, who recently visited the city, had lauded the district administration’s efforts to keep tight vigil on the border. Pointing out that the district had been recording only 125 to 150 Covid cases a day nowadays, the source said the district hadn’t seen any clusters in residential areas, industrial units or schools of late. “Mass vaccination camps are helping us inoculate the maximum eligible population and bring down the cases. In some wards, we have inoculated more than 99% of the eligible population with the first vaccine dose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fresh-coronavirus-cases-plunge-below-50-in-city/articleshow/87051211.cms||V Devanathan
---||Coimbatore||Call for circular rail service connecting suburbs gets louder||Coimbatore: The city residents and industrial bodies have suggested the authorities to utilize the existing railway infrastructure for an exclusive circular rail service covering the entire city, even as the city is taking baby steps to implement the metro rail project. With some additional rail infrastructure, they said, the city railway junction could be connected to suburban locations such as Mettupalayam and Pollachi. Meanwhile, officials, who are conducting feasibility study for the metro rail project, said they had found several bottlenecks on the proposed route. “There are many bridges on the city main roads and we cannot use the same route for constructing the railway line for the metro rail project, as it would escalate the cost manifold. The project may cost Rs 200 crore per km if constructed above the ground and Rs 450 crore a km if built underground,” one of the officials told TOI. Referring to the demand for the circular train service, another official said the same would require revamping of railway infrastructure in the district. “It needs a new railway station and crossing stations.” K Jayaraj, member, Divisional Railway User’s Consultative Committee, Salem division, said the circular railway path was possible from the city railway junction to Irugur station via Coimbatore north, Ganapathy and Peelamedu along Avinashi Road. “From Irugur, it can reach Podanur and finally city junction via Ramanathapuram and Nanjundapuram. At least 10 new stations have to be built on the route, about 75% of which has double track.” J Sathish, coordinator, infrastructure, Coimbatore Development Council, admitted that 10 new stations were required for the circular rail service and the same would cost more than Rs 30 crore. “The entire project cost will not exceed Rs 200 crore,” said Sathish, who has done extensive study on the existing rail infrastructure in the district. He said the trains from suburban locations would be an added advantage. “If we can have train services to the city junction once in two hours from Mettupalayam, Pollachi, Tirupur and Palakkad, we can offer connectivity to most parts of the city and outskirts. Commuting will become hassle-free and the residents need not take own car or two-wheeler like it is in Mumbai.” Sathish said the circular rail project would only complement the metro train project as and when that comes up. “Metro may take time but the circular train service and connecting suburban locations are doable with the existing rail infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/call-for-circular-rail-service-connecting-suburbs-gets-louder/articleshow/87051234.cms||Sampath Kumar

According to Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai)-Nashik and National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), over 300 flats worth Rs120 crore were booked on Dasara. The realty sector was in a bad phase due to Covid-19, which had affected the Dasara business last year. Around 150 flats worth Rs60 crore were booked on the occasion last year. “This Dasara, we witnessed good bookings. The situation was similar in Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon districts of North Maharashtra, Mumbai and Thane. Even customers from the rural parts of Nashik also booked flats on Friday,” said Umesh Wankhede, senior member of Credai-Nashik and chairperson of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture’s (MACCIA) real estate committee. “We are expecting more bookings of flats by Diwali. The demand was mainly for the mid- and large-sized flats with costs between Rs25 lakh and Rs75 lakh. Last year, the demand was mostly for the ready-possession flats. But this year, the demand was for both ready-possession fats and properties under construction. The demand for large size flats, like three and four BHKs, increased due to work-from-home and online education arrangements,” he added. Jayesh Thakkar, senior office-bearer of Naredco Nashik, said prices of properties were still stable despite the huge rise in prices of steel, cement, other building material and labour charges. “The construction cost has increased by Rs 300 per sq ft. But the prices of properties are stable in Nashik. Those who were waiting to buy homes grabbed the opportunity of booking flats on Dasara,” said Thakkar. Last year, no new projects were launched due to the Covid pandemic. Around 50 small and large residential projects with flats in the range between 15 and 50 flats were launched in the city on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dasara-booster-for-real-estate-biz-days-trade-double-than-20-figures/articleshow/87046419.cms||Tushar Pawar

Jewellers said Friday’s business almost matched the trade registered on Dasara in 2019, the year before the pandemic broke out. On Friday, business doubled compared to that of 2020. The jewellers said the day’s business hinted at revival of the sector. Rajendra Odhekar, a jeweller, said the gold prices had reduced as compared to the rates on last year’s Dasara. “Covid-19 had badly affected the jewellery business during the last one-and-a-half years. But business started recovering since Navaratra. We have almost reached the point of pre-Covid Dasara business,” added Odhekar. “Our Dasara business was badly affected due to Covid-19 last year. But the scenario has improved a lot and new Covid cases have significantly dropped during the past three-four months.

Some customers booked their choice of ornaments during Navaratra and picked them up on Friday. “We have been buying gold for the past five-six years. Unfortunately, we could not buy gold last year due to the pandemic. But this year,I resumed the tradition of buying gold coins,” said Gaurav Kale, a private firm employee.

Over 30 students, who have cleared the test, are from Jaipur. This is said to be an exceptional feat with topper Mridul Agarwal, hailing from the city as well who has even created history. Many big schools of the city have students who cleared the examination this year. Tejas Kumar (AIR-88) and Rajat Golechha (AIR-100) have studied from Jayshree Periwal High School, Jaipur. Similarly, Cambridge Court High School has six students who have cleared the examination. Principals of both the schools said that since Class XI, students start preparing for entrance examination of different colleges, so, they have designed the curriculum such that gives students enough time to focus on preparation. Commenting on the possible reason for such a good result for the city, Ashish Arora, expert in IIT-JEE examination in Jaipur, “This year we have given 28 students from our institute and if you consider other coaching institute as well, around 40 selections are from Jaipur. This has never occurred in the past. I believe that because Jaipur is not a technology hub like Hyderabad or Bangalore, we were panicked when lockdown began. Hence, we developed the online system putting our 100% efforts with best of what was available and it worked.” He further said that though there are students who found it difficult to cope up with the online classes, but most students were able to utilise the time they had to spent on commutation. “Students were able to study at home and clear their doubts anytime with their teachers. We even started night doubt clearing session that helped a lot. I think these few factors helped students achieve their marks,” said Arora. There have been good selections from Kota as it being famous for coaching, but slowly Jaipur institutes are giving equal competition to their Kota counterparts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-30-students-clear-jee-advanced-from-jaipur/articleshow/87049595.cms||---

FRC members questioned why over 10,000 individual claims filed by the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers and hundreds of other community claims are pending since 2012. “Authorities are misinterpreting the Act and rules made thereunder, purposely keeping the files on hold and rejecting them citing no reason. Even questions were raised as to how a collector can reject claims on technical grounds when all powers regarding the same are vested with the gram sabha under the Act. As of today, the Goa government has not settled even 10% of the total claims filed. The district collector and tribal welfare department are solely responsible for this,” Gakuved members said. Ravindra Velip, vice-president, Gakuved said that there is a pending case in the Supreme Court with regard to the illegal encroachment of forest land. “The interim order in 2019 for eviction of forest dwellers was stayed in this matter citing pendency of FRA claims under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The Supreme Court had then directed the states to dispose of these claims by June 30, 2021. Despite knowing that the Supreme Court has given the deadline, the state government has delayed the process,” he said. The federation also decided to file an intervention application in the ongoing Supreme Court matter on behalf of the traditional forest dwellers of Goa. Subhodh Kulkarni, a forest rights expert from Maharashtra, attended the meeting along with Ajay Gaude (deputy collector, revenue), Shankar Gaonkar (director of sports authority), Yogini Acharya (assistant director of tribal welfare) and panel of lawyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gakuved-to-move-court-over-forest-rights-claims/articleshow/87051625.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Delhi BJP in-charge Baijyant Jay Panda, leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, former union minister Vijay Goel and others flagged off the campaign. “BJP and PM Narendra Modi stand accountable to the poorest of poor and to ensure this accountability and to reach the last man of the society, we have planned the yatra.

Many Muslim organisations met guardian minister Aslam Shaikh on Thursday for permission to take out Eid-e-Milad processions. “We have demanded permission for processions but also appealed to the community not to waste their money in hiring DJs. People should spend money on charity like buying ration, medicine and paying school and college fees,” said senior cleric and spiritual leader Maulana Moin Ashraf Quadri (Moin Mian) who addressed a meeting of imams and clerics at Sunni Masjid Bilal at Grant Road on Thursday. Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) executive council member and Bandra resident Asif Farooqui said the best way to pay tribute to the Prophet is to follow his message in words and deeds. “A Muslim should be an ideal citizen. Non-Muslim neighbours of a Muslim should feel safe from him or her and feel proud of the conduct of their Muslim neighbour. The holy Prophet also expected this from his community. On this day Muslims must reiterate to live up to those expectations,” Farooqui said. The Prophet’s birthday is also his death anniversary. “People should keep this in mind that it is also the day the holy Prophet passed away. It will be better if the day is spent in prayers and doing good work,” said businessman and IUV Foundation of India president Pervez Lakdawala. Chairman of Byculla-based All India Khilafat Committee, Sarfraz Arzoo, has requested the government to allow it to take out at least a dozen vehicles in the procession of Eid-e-Milad. “As the Covid situation is better than last year’s, we have requested the authorities to allow us to take out a bigger procession. We will maintain all protocol,” said Arzoo. The Khilafat House’s procession is over a century-old and starts from Khilafat House and ends at Crawford Market, covering some thickly-populated areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/clerics-eid-sermon-celebrate-with-prayer-charity/articleshow/87049672.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Mulagunda town panchayat in Gadag revives seven lakes||GADAG: The Mulagunda town panchayat has successfully revived seven lakes under its jurisdiction. The panchayat authorities managed to clear encroachment across 18 acres, which has ensured uninterrupted flow of water into the lakes. The authorities revived three lakes using both government funds, and money they obtained from private organisations. The panchayat’s accomplishment was acknowledged by the government, which awarded it the first prize in lake conservation and revival. Mulagunda town panchayat chief officer MS Bentur said that encroachment along the lakes’ catchment area had left them parched and barren. “We collected all the relevant documents from the land records department, following which we cleared all the encroachment. We revived three lakes with funds disbursed by the government. The Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project sanctioned Rs 4.1 lakh. The total cost of reviving the seven lakes came up to Rs 24 lakh. We issued an open call to the farmers across Mulagunda, and each of them was offered one load of silt removed from the lake free of cost. We enlisted earthmoving machines and tractors from the other nine town panchayats in Gadag. We only bore the expenses for fuel, which helped us save on the rent we may have incurred had we fired private vehicles,” Bentur said. Mulagunda-based farmer Basavaraj Sunkapur said that the revival of the lakes had helped recharge the groundwater reserves in the town. “Many borewells that farmers in and around the town had abandoned have now sprung back to life. Farmers in villages around Mulagunda such as Hosur, Kanavi, Chinchali, Yalavatti have also benefitted from the silt they got, which has improved the fertility of the soil,” Sunkapur said. Bapugouda Bharamagoudra, a farmer from Yalavatti, a village neighbouring Mulagunda, said that many temples located alongside the lakes, had been renovated, and canals feeding them had been cleaned. “The panchayat has also planted saplings around the lakes, which has increased greencover,” he said. Mulagunda town panchayat member Vijaykumar Neelagund appreciated the officials for taking up the initiative of clearing encroachment despite the risk of opposition it may attract from political parties. “Villagers will certainly benefit from this initiative. The revival of the lakes has also translated into an increase in the income from fisheries. Lakes are now attracting birds in thousands, some flying here from the neighbouring Magadi Lake,” said Neelagund, who is vice-president of the Lakes’ Development Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/mulagunda-town-panchayat-in-gadag-revives-seven-lakes/articleshow/87048509.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Lion devours 8-year-old girl sleeping in Amreli farm||RAJKOT: In one of the most brutal assaults by a lion on humans in recent times, an eight-year-old girl was dragged away by a feline that devoured most of her body, in a village of Amreli district, in the early hours of Friday. The incident happened in Goradaka village of Savarkundla taluka, which has a significant presence of wild cats like lions and leopards. The victim Sangita Bhuriya was asleep in the open in a farm along with her relatives. It is suspected that a lion came around 4am and dragged the girl away. Surprisingly, none of her family members realized the attack and it was only in the morning when they searched for her that her body parts were found. According to forest department sources, the lion ate 80% of the girl’s body and they only found the head and one hand of the girl with flesh scattered everywhere. The department concluded that it was a lion after pugmarks were found near-by and some eyewitnesses confirming the movement of lions in this area for the past two days. Talking to TOI, deputy conservator of forest Gir (east), Anshuman Sharma said, “In the morning when family members did not find the girl, they started searching and found her body in pieces and clothes a few meters away from the farm. The marks of dragging, blood stains found on the ground and canine marks were found on the body. Prima facie it’s believed that it was a lion.” The family of 20 people from Madhya Pradesh had come to work here as labourers in the farm of Sardul Chandu. However, Sangita’s parents did not come and she came here with her brother and other relatives just two days ago. The forest department has set the cages to trap the lion. Department sources expressed the possibility that the family might have had fish or meat last night and smell of remaining food could have attracted the lion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lion-devours-eight-year-old-girl-sleeping-in-amreli-farm/articleshow/87049543.cms||---

The buses which were earlier deployed in Karur town were diverted to Trichy as the patronage was poor. TNSTC sources said that the AC buses will ply from Central bus stand to Srirangam and Thuvakudi and have a minimum fare of Rs 15 and maximum fare of Rs 40. Passes will not apply in theses buses and the fares will be double as sought in ordinary and LSS (red buses) services. The buses will have a seating capacity for 40 passengers and 20 for standees. The two routes were identified as viable as passengers heading to tourist destinations and educational institutes including NIT Trichy may opt for the service. The buses will have 16 bus stops covering both the suburbs and city including Thillai Nagar, Chathiram bus stand, TVS tollgate, Thiruverumbur and Ariyamangalam industrial estate.TNSTC said that people preferring limited-stop service may consider the premium AC buses as Trichy has sultry weather on most days of the year. “Based on the response, TNSTC can operate more such AC fleets to encourage public transport among passengers commuting to the transit hubs,” said V Nadaraja, AITUC district president. Of the 150 city buses in TNSTC Trichy, around 15 were upgraded to low-floor and modern buses, while the rest were mostly around more than five years old. “During peak hours, the seats are getting filled. Passengers coming as a family are okay with the fares, while a section of people disembarks after being told about the travel fare,” said R Ramakrishnan, conductor of an AC Bus in Trichy. In early 2011, a mofussil AC bus was utilised as city bus for a brief time, but the service was later withdrawn. While Trichy residents have pitched for another AC bus service connecting the Central bus stand and Railway junction with Trichy international airport, TNSTC said that they will take a call based on the public response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tnstc-starts-ac-bus-services-in-trichy-city/articleshow/87051280.cms||Deepak Karthik

As a mark of protest, a section of employees boycotted the launch and carried out their routine work by wearing black badges.The OFT and HEPF were formerly with the ordnance factory board (OFB) which stands dissolved after the formation of seven DPSUs. While OFT and HEPF will continue to be addressed as they were, the units will have the mention of their DPSU such as a unit of the Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited and a unit of Munition India Limited respectively. Officials said that the focus area and operations will remain unchanged. Singh in his speech maintained that converting OFB into DPSU will improve the efficiency and accountability of the factories. “The aim of this reconstitution is to change the ordnance factories into productive and profitable assets, specialisation in product quality and to improve the quality and cost-efficiency,” he said. He also added that the interest of the serving employees will be safeguarded. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who addressed the virtual launch highlighted the need for incorporating research and innovation in the working culture of the ordnance factories.Meanwhile, the defence employees’ federation and other defence employees’ bodies termed the conversion of OFB as DPSU as unfortunate and unhealthy for workers as well as the armed forces. “This liquidation of the 220-year-old defence industry is the first attempt to privatise the factories. For sure, the cost of the arms produced for the armed forces will increase in the coming years since the DPSUs after some time may have to independently manage their operations and expenses,” a defence employee on condition of anonymity said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/oft-becomes-dpsu-amid-staff-protest/articleshow/87051283.cms||---

While the directive was not clear whether the classes will resume for kindergarten in the next month, some parents have expressed interest to resume classroom teaching for a short duration in a regular interval.The government and corporation schools saw large turnout of students for enrollment. The Singarathope Corporation Middle School in Madurai has seen its student population increasing steadily after the pandemic. Headmaster of the school Joseph Jeyaseelan said that their student strength had been just 34 before March 2020. It went up to 90 by March 21 and another 70 have enrolled between April and October this year. On Friday, six students got enrolled for classes one to five.“I was praying for schools to reopen because my child started having his meals only if we gave him the mobile phone or switched on television,” said T Jayalakshmi, of Nagamalai Pudukottai, a teacher and mother of a three-year-old boy. B Pitchaiammal, Avaniapuram, parent of a six-year-old girl said, “I did not want to spend on online teaching last year, so I don’t mind that she is a year old for her class.”Large crowds were seen outside small neighbourhood playschools on Friday, where eager parents wanted to have somewhere to send their children for a few hours.Meanwhile, schools said that they witnessed a lull in enrollment last year. “This Vijayadasami, we are seeing a strong revival in inquiries. Some parents opted to experiment with hybrid learning,” Jaisri Raju, vice-principal, BVM Global School, Trichy, said. While some of the parents are still hesitant to send their children aged below five years to schools, a section has enrolled their wards. Schools said that they are open for hybrid learning, which includes some minimal hours spent in classroom teaching. Teachers stated that parents are not quite satisfied with the prolonged virtual learning since it was difficult to keep the child focussed.In rural areas in Trichy, parents seem to have given an attempt for early learning at government schools. In the Unaiyur village, the government school conducted Vidyarambam by making the children write Tamil letters on a plate filled with paddy grains.Children were also taken to temples to initiate them to the world of letters. Schools also performed the Vidyarambham rituals and ceremonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-seek-resumption-of-regular-classes-in-schools/articleshow/87051284.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: E-waste collection drive launched at divisional headquarters||JAIPUR: Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) launched mobile van at divisional headquarters for door-to-door collection of e-waste. RSPCB chairman Vinu Gupta flagged off the van. She said that under the e-collection drive to be run from October 14-24, e-waste would be collected from the users by authorised dismantlers and recyclers and they would also be given suitable incentives and certificates for the same. Gupta also launched the e-waste “Take Back Web Portal”. Gupta said that the need of authorised data is being felt for proper disposal of e-waste in the state. Keeping this in view, MoA has been signed with Environment Protection Training and Research Institute, Hyderabad for the study of e-waste in the state. Under this, five cities of the state Jaipur, Jodhpur, Ajmer, Kota and Udaipur e-waste collection will be studied so that the quantum of e-waste generation and disposal could be accurately calculated in the state. She said that with the development of technology, the problem of e-waste is increasing rapidly in both urban as well as rural areas. That is why plans are being made to recycle e-waste on a large scale. She told the recyclers that they would have to work towards the disposal of at least 30,000 metric tonnes of e-waste per year and at the same time the general public should be made aware about e-waste. Member Secretary of the Board Anand Mohan informed that “International E-Waste Day-2021” has been organized for the first time by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. “E-Waste Collection Drive” is being organized for various industrial areas and residential colonies of Bhilwara, Jodhpur, Alwar and Bhiwadi, residential welfare association, shopping malls and other commercial institutions. He said that e-waste would be collected through "mobile vans" and public would also be made aware in this regard through posters, banners. He told that RLG India had developed an e-waste portal named “Take Back Web Portal” by which individuals or organizations could dispose of e-waste from home similar to e-commerce site and can get fair price for e-waste online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/e-waste-collection-drive-launched-at-divisional-hqs/articleshow/87049746.cms||---
---||Delhi||AQI nears 200 as Delhi starts to choke ahead of winter||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality touched the higher end of “moderate” category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 198 on Friday, stated Central Pollution Control Board. As the fire counts increased significantly on Friday, experts said the national capital’s air quality was likely to reach the “poor” category on Saturday. However, it’s predicted to improve from the evening for a few days due to easterly winds and light rain. Air Quality Early Warning System, a prediction model under the Union earth sciences ministry, said 10-15% contribution in Delhi’s PM2.5 on Friday was likely to be from biomass burning. According to it, fire points due to crop residue burning were observed over Haryana (98), Punjab (229) and adjoining Pakistan on Thursday. “However, high fire counts were recorded on Friday — Punjab (660) and Haryana (360), according to Indian Agricultural Research Institute. The air quality of the capital is likely to deteriorate to the ‘poor’ category on Saturday,” said V K Soni, head of the environment and research centre at India Meteorological Department. Delhi’s 13 monitoring stations — Shadipur, NSIT Dwarka, Punjabi Bagh, Sector 8 in Dwarka, Patparganj, Ashok Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Okhla Phase II, Bawana, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Mundka, Anand Vihar and Chandni Chowk — recorded AQI in the “poor” category on Friday afternoon itself. The last time the city reported an overall “poor” AQI was on July 2, when it was 245. An AQI between 101 and 200 falls in the “moderate” category while “poor” ranges from 201 to 300. Apart from stubble burning, calm wind during night hours, drop in temperature and low mixing layer height affected the air quality on Friday. The city’s minimum temperature dropped to 18.6 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, which was also the post-monsoon season’s lowest night temperature. “Due to the dip in temperature, the mixing layer height also came down at night. The pollutants cannot go up in the atmosphere when mixing layer height is low,” Soni pointed out. However, the Met department has forecast easterly winds from Saturday evening and there is a possibility of very light rain or thundershowers towards evening or night. Light-to-moderate rain is expected on Sunday and light showers are likely on Monday. “The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 is likely to reduce on Sunday and Monday due to change in the wind direction. Besides, the rain is favourable for removal of pollutants,” said an official. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a forecasting body under the central ministry, said there was an impact of stubble burning on Delhi’s air. “AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as the main pollutant. Under dry conditions (very low humidity), local dust resuspension is leading to high PM10. AQI will degrade to be in the ‘poor’ category and then improve due to moisture input from eastern India,” said SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-nears-200-as-city-starts-to-choke-ahead-of-winter/articleshow/87049738.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Coimbatore||‘Rate card’ circular from HQ bares rampant corruption in Tamil Nadu police||COIMBATORE: Acknowledging institutionalised corruption in the force, the Tamil Nadu police have compiled a list of 61 activities for which station-level cops have a bribe ‘rate card’ ranging from Rs 100 to more than Rs 1 lakh. A police headquarters circular shows bribe received by cops from the rank of inspector to constable — Rs 1 lakh for allowing banned lottery sale or civil disputes, Rs 60,000 for illegal liquor, Rs 30,000 for sand smuggling, and Rs 10,000 for gambling and accident cases. The memo warns corrupt personnel of stringent action. A circular issued by M Sree Abhinav, superintendent of police, Salem district, to additional superintendents of police (ADSPs), deputy superintendents of police (DSPs), and all special units on October 11 said some police personnel received illegal gratification from anti-social elements involved in selling ganja, lotteries, illegal liquor and smuggled sand, and gambling and prostitution in the name of massage parlours, every month. “We received the circular from our higher authorities in Chennai. Based on the circular, instructions have been given to all police personnel in Salem district. Cops receiving bribes for supporting anti-social elements and receiving money from public will be punished severely,” Sree Abhinav said. Coimbatore district superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam also issued a similar circular to DSPs and inspectors, instructing them not to involve in illegal gratification. Erring cops will face stringent action, he warned. Already, Selvanagarathinam had placed five police personnel under suspension on corruption charges. Coming as it does in the middle of the festival season, when ‘gifts in kind’ and corruption peaks, the circular as well as the accompanying warning have sent ripples among cops across the state. The circular mentions how much money each inspector of police, sub-inspector or even a police station writer receives for different types of public service entrusted to them. Some inspectors collect Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh for civil disputes and Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh for conducting inquiry on current papers and from gun powder godown, it said. Inspectors also receive Rs 2,000 from per lodge per month and Rs 5,000 from per spa, it said, adding that they also receive Rs 10,000 to Rs 60,000 from people indulging in illegal sale of liquor. The circular listed bribes taken by sub-inspectors ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000 from various offenders, bribes taken by special branch (SB) personnel posted in each station ranging from Rs 500 to 5,000, and station writes, who take bribe of Rs 100 to issue an FIR copy and up to Rs 1,000 from gamblers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rate-card-circular-from-hq-bares-rampant-corruption-in-tn-police/articleshow/87049750.cms||A Subburaj
---||Delhi||Report shows a significant decline in stubble burning events this year||NEW DELHI: Paddy residue burning events have got reduced by 69.49% in Punjab, 18.28% in Haryana and 47.61% in the eight National Capital Region (NCR) districts of Uttar Pradesh during the one-month period since September 15 compared to the same period last year, according to a report based on the protocol framed by Isro for Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas. The commission has been actively monitoring such occurrences from September 15 to curb air pollution during the ongoing harvest season. It said on Friday that in the past one month, the total reported residue burning events in Punjab are 1,286 as against 4,216 for the same period in 2020. Similarly, the reported fire incidents are 487 as against 596 in Haryana and 22 as compared to 42 in the eight UP districts. However, no fire count has been reported from Delhi and two NCR districts of Rajasthan, the commission stated. The first paddy residue burning was reported on September 16 in Punjab, September 28 in Haryana and September 18 in the NCR area of UP. In Punjab, the major hotspots are Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Patiala and Ludhiana districts, accounting for 72% of stubble burning events in the state. Similarly, the major hotspots in Haryana are Karnal, Kaithal and Kurukshetra districts that account for 80% of the state’s share. The commission said it “is taking up (the issue) with the state governments of Punjab, Haryana and UP on a daily basis to ensure strict implementation of the action plan and the framework to curb paddy residue burning events”. It has also held a series of meetings with state government officials. “Harvesting will be at its peak in the next few weeks and the state governments are taking steps as per the plan of action to improve the efficacy of enforcement and implementation to effectively tackle the problem of stubble burning,” the commission added. Of the total 1,795 sites where burning has been reported till October 14, 663 fields have been inspected by the enforcement agencies and environmental compensation has been imposed in 252 cases. However, experts said the fire counts were likely to rise from October-end. “We are already in mid-October, only a week away from the peak stubble burning window (late October to early November), during which the count may go up to 3,000-4,000 fires a day,” said L S Kurinji, programme associate at Council on Energy, Environment and Water. He added, “The Punjab government should ensure the financial viability of — and timely access to — crop residue management options, as well as initiate targeted outreach to trigger behaviour change among farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/report-shows-a-significant-decline-in-stubble-burning-events-this-year/articleshow/87049791.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Karmuse said he had lost confidence in Thane police, as their investigation was “flawed and done deliberately to save the minister and his aides”. The complainant said, “I don’t understand why the police took 17 months to arrest a minister. His name was clearly mentioned in my statement, but the police refused to make him an accused and arrested him last.” He added that even the cops accused in the case had not suffered any penalty.  “I don’t think when the home ministry portfolio is with their party they will give me justice here,” said Karmuse, referring to the state home ministry, helmed by an NCP minister. A senior Thane police officer claimed that the investigation had been conducted fairly. Meanwhile, Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition, said, “Why was action against the minister taken so secretly?

---||Ajmer||Rajasthan: Pushkar cattle fair from November 5||AJMER: After two years, the international cattle fair will be held in Pushkar from November 5. Though there are no reservations confirmed from foreign tourist agencies, but still cattle owners are happy that they will be able to sell their cattle. Because of Covid, there was no cattle fair in 2020, but this year, there was a demand by different organisations to organise the fair to the state government. Looking at this, the state government has allowed the cattle fair but with strict following of the Covid guidelines. Camel riding on sand dunes of Pushkar is a major attraction for tourists from different parts of the world. The religious rituals and participation of Naga and Aghori saints in large numbers is another attraction for devotees. Devotees will arrive from different parts of the state and elsewhere at the time of full moon of Kartik month (Hindu calendar). But the hotel and guest house owners doubt that there will be a good business this time. One of the hotel owners said that at least the message that Pushkar is open again for tourists, will be a positive sign for the business. According to the direction by principal secretary Arushi Malik, district collector of Ajmer asked to conduct the fair as per the three-tier Jan Anushasan and the permission of organising the fair was given to district officials. The 15-day Pushkar fair will start after Diwali and with that, cattle owners will start coming to Pushkar. There will be religious rituals, cultural programmes and other activities at the fair, which will end with a holy dip in the Pushkar Sarovar on the full moon of Kartik month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/pushkar-cattle-fair-from-november-5/articleshow/87054817.cms||---
---||Goa||Childline sees rise in complaints directly from kids since start of pandemic||PANAJI: Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic began, Childline has been receiving more complaints directly from children. Childline is the foundation under the Union ministry of women and child development, working for child labour, child trafficking, child abuse, child marriage, homeless child, conflict with parents and other such activities. A complaint the NGO received on its 1098 helpline was from a teenager regarding child marriage. The NGO found that the parents of the girl, who is under the age of 18, were upset over her male companion and took her to their native village out of Goa on the pretext of attending a function, where they got her married and discontinued her higher education. “The girl was quiet and didn’t open up in front of her parents when she returned, but informed us separately that she had been married at a religious ceremony and that her husband was pressurising her to have physical relations. Since we received this information from the child, we had to take action,” counsellor at the South district Childline, Suvidhya Naik said. A complaint was registered at the police station, following which the parents were called and told to break off the marriage. “The police were successful in convincing the parents to break off the marriage and the parents have allowed her to continue her higher education. The situation is now under control,” she told TOI. Another recent complaint that came in was that of a baby found malnourished after she was abandoned by the mother in her native state to remarry. The baby’s grandparents brought the child back to Goa where her father lives and took her to Goa Medical College (GMC) where she was treated. Her mother left Goa with the child who was on breast milk and abandoned her, and was also not interested in continuing with the marriage. She was admitted at GMC a few weeks ago when doctors asked Childline to follow up on the case where the father and grandparents were ready to take responsibility for the child. “The child has recovered and the father, who is the only earning member in the family, has asked us to help us with baby formula and nutrition for the child. We are keeping a check on the child’s well being,” coordinator for South District Childline, Blanco Dias said. While most parents are reluctant to report cases of their children being abused, a mother called up Childline to report sexual assault of her very young child. The child, who was in the care of a grandparent while the mother was at work, was sexually assaulted by the neighbour and was too young to realise what had happened. The child’s mother found out after the child complained of pain and called 1098, after which a case under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered against the middle-aged neighbour who was taken into police custody. The NGO has been visiting the family who has little means, with ration. In another instance, the grandparents of a child who was sexually abused by a relative, told the child not to reveal the incident to anyone and not to complain, leaving the child in a helpless position as the parents are abroad. “Many are worried that their reputation in society will suffer if they file a complaint. They don’t think about the well being and mental health of the child. The mental health of their children is the most important. If a child suffers in their childhood and the problem is not addressed, the symptoms will show when he/she grows up, when the child turns aggressive, and then it is more difficult to handle and tougher to get them out of such situations,” Naik said. Students have also recently been calling up the helpline asking for school books and educational material which the NGO has to source using volunteer groups, etc. During the pandemic, most calls have been a result of parents and children having too much exposure with each other as well as that of alcoholic fathers abusing their wives and children, Dias said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/childline-sees-rise-in-complaints-directly-from-kids-since-start-of-pandemic/articleshow/87051347.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Delhi||Delhi: Marathon transplants give gift of vision to 12 in 24 hours||NEW DELHI: In a massive exercise, doctors at Delhi’s Guru Nanak Eye Centre (GNEC) recently conducted 12 corneal transplants in 24 hours. It gave the gift of sight to 12 people suffering from corneal blindness. Most of them are from poor or lower middle class families that had been waiting for cornea donation for nearly six months, the doctors said. Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye. It allows light to enter and performs two-thirds of the focusing tasks. For people suffering from vision loss due to irreparable damage of the tissue, transplant is the only option. Dr Ritu Arora, medical director of GNEC, told TOI that a corneal transplant involves replacing a diseased or scarred cornea with a donor graft. “We have counsellors posted at both the hospital and in the mortuary of Lok Nayak Hospital. They try to convince families of the deceased to donate organs, including the corneas, so the life and sight of the needy patients can be saved. With their help, we were able to get 15 corneas between Saturday and Wednesday. Of them, 12 were used to conduct cornea transplant,” she said. The GNEC director said all prospective recipients were not admitted to the hospital. “We have a list of prospective recipients. Once the cornea donations were confirmed, we called 20 people from the list for transplant and of them, 12 people who cleared the screening test to rule out any infection, for example Covid-19, underwent the surgery on Thursday,” she explained. A team of doctors, two consultants and four senior resident doctors worked together to carry out 12 surgeries in a single day. Before this, GNEC doctors said, the hospital had conducted nine cornea transplants in 24 hours in 2011. Other leading eye hospitals like AIIMS Delhi have also carried out multiple corneal transplants in a day, they added. Last year, due to the pandemic, corneal transplants reduced significantly. According to Eye Bank Association of India (EBAI), between April 2019 and March 2020, that is, the year before the pandemic hit the country, India conducted 27,075 corneal transplants. Post-pandemic, between April 2020 and March 2021, this number reduced to 12,998 approximately, a drop of nearly 52%. Dr Namrata Sharma, honorary general secretary of EBAI, who is also a professor of ophthalmology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said one of the main reasons for the sharp drop in corneal transplants, also referred to as eye transplant, was the lack of cornea or eye donation. Retrieval of corneal tissue was suspended temporarily when Covid outbreak started in March-end. Corneal transplants were also put on hold, she said. More than 11 lakh people in India suffer from blindness due to impairment of the cornea. To remedy this, cornea donated by a deceased person is used to replace the impaired cornea in the patient. “We are very thankful to the family of the donors who consented for cornea donation at such a difficult time,” GNEC director Dr Arora said while appealing to others to also come forward to make the donation in the eventuality of the death of a loved one to give the gift of sight to needy people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/marathon-transplants-give-gift-of-vision-to-12-in-24-hrs/articleshow/87049827.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

As a fall out of the ongoing rift between Kadam and Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab, Sena leaders said Kadam was not invited for the Dussehra Rally. Kadam did not name Parab in the letter, according to Sena leaders. “Certain people are using their power as ministers to finish off old Sena leaders. They should instead use this power for the welfare of the people. These ministers are working against me,” Kadam reportedly wrote. He, however, has denied any rift between him and Parab. “I was on oxygen support for three months and doctors have advised me not to venture out. Party leaders don’t need any invitation for the rally; I didn’t attend the rally purely due to health reasons,” Kadam, a former cabinet minister,told TOI.

An investigation of the money trail led police to the three accused. Police also found that the accused had used the extortion money to buy cryptocurrency from a Nigerian gang. Malabar Hill police arrested Darshan Shailash Bhati (28), Jasraj Darji (22) and Sawailal Babulal Darji (21), and recovered two laptops, three mobile phones, 25 debit/credit cards and four SIM cards from them. The trio was booked under the IPC sections of extortion, defamation, threatening act and the Information Technology Act. A 32-year-old businessman from Malabar Hill in June lodged a complaint with Malabar Hill police that he received a video from an Instagram ID of him taking a bath in the nude. The caller said that if the businessman failed to pay Rs 37,000 online to two accounts, he will make the video public on social media. The complainant paid the amount, but the accused uploaded the video and even sent it to his friends, who then informed him. The complainant then lodged an FIR. The cops learnt that the accused had exchanged the extortion money through a mobile app, which deals in cryptocurrency. “They said that they transferred the money to the account of a Nigerian who appears to be a fraud. The WhatsApp chats between the accused and several Nigerians show that trio is deeply involved in crime which needs to be probed,” said an officer. Police are also probing how the accused got access to the victim’s video, and if there are other victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/three-youths-held-for-blackmailing-bizman-with-his-nude-video-in-mumbai/articleshow/87049898.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: High fuel prices dampen festive spirit for transporters||JAIPUR: The increasing fuel prices have dampened the festive spirit for the transporters who claimed that their revenue was just 40% of pre-Covid days. While the pandemic has played a role, diesel prices skyrocketing in brief intervals have left them hapless and with negligible profits, heavy vehicles operators rued. Anil Arora, president, Jaipur Transporters’ Association, said, "while we are still getting business, the revenue has been drastically reduced. Although the pandemic has played a role, we cannot totally blame it since it is a global issue and not just limited to us. The diesel price, on the other hand, has really forced us to look for ways to cut down on additional expenditure. Due to the rampant rise in fuel prices, prices of other materials like tyres, lubricants, etc., have also gone up so we are actually taking a beating from all sides." The fuel pump owners are already facing losses due to the high VAT imposed on petrol and diesel in Rajasthan as compared to the neighbouring states. While there is 36% VAT on diesel, petrol has 26% VAT. Transporters claimed that due to the festival season, they are unable to protest against the fuel prices as it would lead to their own loss. "Every heavy vehicle operator wants that the trucks should be on the road to cover the cost of maintenance, EMIs, insurance, staff salaries, etc. For this, even if the operator has to reduce the cost of transportation then he is willing to do so which was not the case previously as there was certain kind of uniformity in the rates," a transporter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/high-fuel-prices-dampen-festive-spirit-for-transporters/articleshow/87049872.cms||---

GRE stated that the fisheries department in 2016 and the central government in 2017, had banned the use of bull trawling in the territorial waters and Indian Exclusive Zone (EEZ). However, over hundred trawlers from Karnataka are using the banned destructive gears without the fear of law or or Goa government, GRE further stated. “If this continues, then there could be law and order situation in the state and only the state government will be responsible for any untoward incident,” Rodrigues said adding that two trawlers from Malpe, Karnataka, were caught in South Goa. GRE general secretary Olencio Simoes has also demanded that the illegal boats from Malpe should be impounded. He has appealed to the fisheries minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues to immediately direct the fisheries department to strictly implement the law on bull trawling and other violations. GRE has further warned the department that if the Karnataka boats are let free without taking any strict action, then the next time the traditional fishermen will take the law in their hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-bull-trawling-by-karnataka-boats/articleshow/87051673.cms||---

The most number of submissions pertain to issues related to economy, environment and transport. The suggestions range from more co-working spaces and multi-storied warehouses to more noise monitoring facilities and an intelligent traffic management system that can send alerts in case of traffic congestion. DDA is going to hold an online public hearing based on these suggestions and objections on October 18 and 20, for which 17,162 people who had submitted these suggestions have been invited. Following objections from residents’ welfare associations and activists, the authority on Friday clarified in a statement that it is “committed to provide sufficient time for hearing and considering the suggestions and objections on MPD 2041.” DDA said that proceedings of the board of enquiry and hearing would start from October 18, but the hearings would be conducted during October and November 2021. The authority, however, didn’t specify how many sessions would be held to give “ample chance of hearing” to everyone. DDA said that the suggestions had been categorised into different sections. The environment section includes suggestions regarding the protection of Yamuna floodplain and focus on riverfront development, preservation of green areas, installation of more noise monitoring stations, promotion of electric vehicles, etc. The suggestions related to the national capital’s economy include redevelopment plans for local shopping complexes, commercial complexes, integrated office complexes, etc., allowing individual redevelopment of plots, permitting street vending and informal markets, more co-working spaces, possibilities of converting existing warehouses into multi-storey warehouses, etc. Under the transport and mobility section, many people suggested better parking facilities. There are also suggestions for timely preparation of a comprehensive mobility plan for Delhi. The East Delhi RWAs Joint Front, for instance, raised the issue of increasing number of vehicles and lack of adequate parking in the city in its submission.  “Surprisingly, Delhi had over 75 lakh vehicles (2019), but the parking space available was for less than a lakh of vehicles, and government has not yet introduced any checks on the sale of vehicles in the city,” the umbrella body of east Delhi RWAs said. Another issue that many RWAs and citizens groups have raised is that of increasing commercialisation. Their suggestions include discouraging mixed-use development and reviewing mixed-use streets provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/what-delhi-wants-less-noise-more-co-working-space-smoother-traffic/articleshow/87049873.cms||Sidharatha Roy

With a score of 286 out of 360, her common rank list was, however, 98. An alumna of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, Chopra secured the top rank among the 6,452 female students who qualified in the examinations. A total of 41,862 students have qualified the JEE (Advanced) this year. The Delhi resident said that while she began her coaching from Class VIII onwards, her formal training and preparations for the JEE began only in Class XI. “For the first two years, my training was mostly oriented towards Olympiads. It was only in Class XI and XII that I began formal preparations for the JEE,” she said. Chopra who aims to study computer science from IIT-Delhi said, “Apart from it being the most convenient for me, IIT-Delhi is also one of the best for computer science. I have always been more inclined towards mathematics. However, a career in computer science will enable me to go towards that field. The two are heavily interlinked and the field offers a lot of financial stability as well.” In her IIT-JEE Mains, Chopra had scored 300 out of 300 marks. A resident of Jaipur, all India topper Mridul Agarwal, who scored 348 out of 360 marks, also appeared from the Delhi zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-perfect-iit-jee-score-city-girl-tops-jee-adv-too/articleshow/87049902.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Kanjur land is for affordable housing, not Metro: Lease-holder to govt||MUMBAI: The Garodia family, which has staked claim over a 500-acre plot in Kanjurmarg and Bhandup — a part of which is being eyed by the state for the metro depot – has informed Maharashtra government that it intends to use the land to build affordable housing along with construction firm Shapoorji Pallonji. Documents procured under the Right to Information (RTI) Act show that Maheshkumar Garodia, who claims to be the lessee of the salt pan land owned by the Centre, has strongly objected to the state’s plan to use a portion of this marshland sprawl to set up a metro rail car shed for lines 3 and 6. The state has been so far unable to find an alternate site for the car shed after it shifted the depot for metro line 3 from the eco-sensitive Aarey green belt, where over 2,000 trees were cut. “I would like to submit that I have, through Shapoorji Pallonji, submitted a proposal for development of the said land for generation of affordable housing units and it is under active consideration of the government. The state revenue department has also constituted a study group under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary, finance, to study our proposal and submit recommendations,” said Garodia’s objection letter to the deputy director of town planning (Greater Mumbai). The letter dated December 3, 2020, said the Garodias have been the lessee of about 500 acres of land since the past several decades. It includes about 249 acres within the limits of village Kanjur (Jenkins Salt Works) and village Bhandup and another 251 acres of marsh land of village Kanjur (Arthur Salt Works). Garodia said in 2005 he was forced to move the Bombay high court, challenging the “thoroughly illegal” orders passed by the deputy salt commissioner terminating the leases. The court on April 26, 2005, granted interim relief in his favour, he added. The suit was subsequently transferred to the city civil court, which restrained the salt department from dispossessing him. “The matter is still pending for final disposal with the court and the above mentioned orders are binding, valid and subsisting,” said Garodia. Last December, the Bombay high court criticised the Mumbai suburban collector's order declaring the Kanjurmarg plot as belonging to the state. The court said the Centre and its lessee Mahesh Garodia had made out a “very strong case” to stay his order to transfer the 102 acres of Kanjurmarg land to MMRDA for a metro car shed. In a separate petition Mahesh Garodia, claiming to be the Centre's lessee on the land for over a century, argued that the MMRDA and state had “all along known it was central land” and yet without hearing him had transferred the land for a metro car shed. Despite there being an interim order in a suit of 2005 between the lessee and Centre as argued by him, the HC said the collector had tried to hand it over to MMRDA, which bordered on “fraud”. Activist Zoru Bhathena, who filed the RTI, said Garodia’s objection is purely to exploit the land for himself. “He claims he has entered into a development agreement with Shapoorji Pallonji and that his commercial interest to develop the plot is affected. This, coming from someone whose lease has expired. It is shocking that he has stalled the depot for the metro lines,” he said. Of the 500 acres here, the state has staked claim to 102 for metro lines 3 and 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kanjur-land-is-for-affordable-housing-not-metro-lease-holder-to-govt/articleshow/87049921.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

Aspirants seeking admissions under the second cutoff list had time till Friday 5pm to complete the payment process and secure their seats. According to data provided by the university, the total number of payments that were made in the first two lists stood at 51,974. At DU, there are around 70,000 seats on offer this year across the various colleges. Despite the sky high cutoffs this year, seats across courses in the respective colleges filled up rapidly. Suman Sharma, principal of Lady Shri Ram College for Women, said that certain combinations of BA (prog), BA (H) Hindi and BA (H) Sanskrit were likely to close for the third list apart from BA (H) Philosophy and BSc (H) Mathematics that closed after the first list itself. The cutoff for BA (H) Philosophy and BSc (H) Mathematics had been pegged at 97.5% and 98.5%, respectively. “In the third list, some courses will close while certain others will remain open. However, for the ones which remain open, very marginal dips will be seen under the third cutoff list,” Sharma said. While the third cutoff list is expected to be released on Saturday, the varsity will be declaring a special cutoff list on October 25, before the fourth list is released. The university said that the special cutoff list would be declared depending on the availability of seats. Admission under the third cutoff list is expected to begin from October 18 and continue till October 21. Aspirants will be able to pay the fees by October 23 to secure their admissions under the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/less-than-20k-seats-left-at-du-third-list-likely-today/articleshow/87049933.cms||---
---||Delhi||Husband bound to compensate wife for spend on major son: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has said a father cannot be absolved of all the responsibilities to meet the education expenses of his son because he may have attained the age of majority. Justice Subramonium Prasad said a father is bound to compensate the wife, who after spending on children, may hardly be left with anything to maintain herself. The high court further said it cannot shut its eyes to the reality that simply attaining majority does not translate into the understanding that the major son is earning sufficiently. “The husband must also carry the financial burden of making certain that his children are capable of attaining a position in society wherein they can sufficiently maintain themselves. The mother cannot be burdened with the entire expenditure on the education of her son just because he has completed 18 years of age...,” Justice Prasad said in the order. The high court further noted that it was true that in the majority of households, women are unable to work due to sociocultural as well as structural impediments, and, thus, cannot financially support themselves. “However, in households wherein the women are working and are earning sufficiently to maintain themselves, it does not automatically mean that the husband is absolved of his responsibility to provide sustenance for his children,” it said. It added that at the age of 18, it can be safely assumed that the son is either graduating from XII standard or is in his first year of college, and more often than not, it does not place him in a position wherein he can earn to sustain or maintain himself. The court said that the Supreme Court and other high courts have, in a slew of judgements, upheld the maintenance allowance granted to a son post attaining majority on the ground that the father has a duty to finance basic education of the child and the child cannot be deprived of his right to be educated due to his parents getting divorced. The court’s observations came on an application seeking review of an order by which the husband was directed to pay Rs 15,000 per month as interim maintenance to his wife till their son completes his graduation or starts earning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/husband-bound-to-compensate-wife-for-spend-on-major-son/articleshow/87049969.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Centre using drug hauls, celebrities arrests to defame Maharashtra: CM Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: Demanding an end to “interference” by the Central government in day-to-day functioning, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has called for an open debate on the federal structure to sharply define Centre-state ties within the broad framework of the Constitution. Addressing Shiv Sena’s annual Dussehra rally at the Shanmukhananda auditorium in Sion on Friday, Thackeray praised West Bengal for taking on the Modi regime during the state assembly elections and indicated that Maharashtra may need to draw a leaf out of the same strategy. Thackeray, who heads a three-party alliance which has Central investigating agencies such as ED and I-T breathing down its neck, went all out to target the BJP in a speech that appeared to be a prelude to his campaign ahead of the Mumbai civic elections. Uddhav flaunts his Hindutva colours, says we are like RSSIn a broadside intended to burnish his own saffron credentials, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said Hindutva was not under threat from anyone else but from neo-Hindus who were exploiting the term to come to power. "They are now adopting the British policy of divide and rule to remain in power." Thackeray said under the Constitution, the states and Centre enjoy equal powers and states don’t have to genuflect before the Centre. He alleged that the BJP-led Centre was trying to destabilise Maharashtra by resorting to IT raids to ‘fix’ the state’s leaders. “At a time when companies are leaving China and Maharashtra is trying to attract them, even in the pandemic, they are trying to defame Maharashtra by making drug hauls and catching some celebrities," he added. “They sent CSR funds to Gujarat, central departments are giving funds to RSS and pro-BJP organizations…they are all talking as if there are drugs in every corner here, and are sniffing out a few grams of drugs, but drugs worth crores were found at the Mundra port in Gujarat,” Thackeray said. He praised Mumbai police for seizing drugs of Rs 150 crore, "while they (NCB) made a big thing about sniffing a few grams and taking photos with celebrities who were caught." Thackeray dared the BJP to topple his government. “They have been trying very hard. But let me dare them to topple my government. You are hiding behind the CBI, ED and Income Tax departments." Invoking a sense of Maharashtrian pride against the purported onslaught from the Centre, he said, "Like West Bengal, Maharashtra should be prepared for war and not hold back. They will divide us on caste lines. But we have to come together as Marathi manoos. Not only Marathi manoos, but we have to bring non-Marathis with us as well. Hindu unity is important against them." The call to mobilise potential vote banks is a sign of the coming challenge that will test the Sena and BJP's resilience and popularity across castes and communities in maximum city, said political experts. Seeking to draw a distinction between the RSS worldview and the politics practised by BJP, Thackeray stressed that he was not criticising RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. He said Sena’s Hindutva and that of RSS was identical. “Our ideology is the same. But it seems your students have forgotten what Hindutva is. Had there been no Shiv Sena during the 1992-93 riots, these leaders may not have been here today. They were all in hiding...only Shiv Sena was out on the street," he said. “BJP hasn’t understood Savarkar and Gandhi both. We are celebrating the 75th anniversary of our Independence, but these people were not part of the freedom movement." Thackeray also took a dig at Prime Minister Modi saying he wasn’t “a fakir with a jholi (bag)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-flaunts-his-hindutva-colours-says-we-are-like-rss/articleshow/87049950.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Bail for murder accused in jail since 2015 as trial lags||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court granted bail to a man, arrested in a murder case, while noting that he has been in jail for six years. The court further noted that only six witnesses, out of a total of 34 witnesses, have been examined and two of them partially so far in the matter. Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil took into consideration the fact that the trial might take a considerable time as no effective hearing has taken place in the case for the last one-and-a-half years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The court further noted that the accused, who has been in custody since October 2015, was not the main person who had allegedly fired the shot at the deceased. It added that full functioning of the court would also take time. “Taking note of the number of witnesses yet to be examined, the trial of the case may take a considerable time. Therefore, without adverting much to the merits of the case at this stage, taking note of the nature of allegations and the fact that the applicant was not the main person who had fired the shot at the deceased and the custody period of the applicant, in my considered opinion, it is a fit case to grant bail to the applicant/accused,” the court said in the order. It granted him the relief on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of like amount each. It directed him not to tamper with evidence in the matter and to join the investigation as and when required by the investigating officer. The accused’s counsel submitted that one of the public witnesses has not identified the present applicant, and no incriminating role whatsoever was attributed to him, besides the fact that he was merely a driver. He further argued that of the six witnesses examined so far, examination in chief of one of them was deferred on the request of the prosecution way back in 2016 and despite a lapse of five years, he has not been further examined in the case. The counsel claimed that the witnesses, including the complainant, are deliberately avoiding their presence in the court merely to delay the proceedings of the case. Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying the accused was involved in serious and heinous offence of committing murder. He added that the witnesses examined so far have duly supported the case of the prosecution and have also identified the accused as one of the alleged perpetrators of the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-for-murder-accused-in-jail-since-2015-as-trial-lags/articleshow/87050002.cms||Usha Das
---||Goa||App launched to facilitate speedy snake rescues||Keri: A wildlifer Charan Desai from Ponda has launched SAWE Goa mobile app to initiate rescue, rehabilitation and research of snakes and wildlife in the state. The app was launched on the occasion of Ghatsthapana and Wildlife Week celebration at Khandola with an aim to compile roadkills and facilitate speedy rescues of snakes and other wildlife animals. Wildlifers have requested the state government to put in place a protocol for volunteers involved in snake rescues. “The app will be used by a few of our members, and after studying the pitfalls, it will be made available in public domain. Goa’s forest department should establish a protocol for wildlifers who are involved in rescuing snakes. Details of all snake rescuers should be compiled and identity cards should be issued to them,” Desai, a member of Goa State Wildlife Advisory Board, told TOI. Emphasising on the need for identity cards, Amrutsingh, president of Animal Rescue Squad, Bicholim said, “Our members who are scattered in various parts of the state have been actively involved in rescuing snakes, a task which is fraught with risks and no human security.” Incidents of snakes entering human settlements have increased in the past decade, forcing anxious people to seek help of rescuers without knowing whether the reptile is venomous or not. Vitthal Shelke, a wildlifer associated with Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade from Keri-Sattari said, “During the Covid-19 pandemic, I had rescued more than 100 venomous snakes like spectacled cobra, russell’s viper, common krait and non-venomous snakes like rat snake, Indian rock python, bronzeback tree snake, common wolf snake, sand boa, checkered keelback in Keri and vicinity. People are becoming increasingly intolerant of snakes. Having rat snakes in the locality is actually essential as they curtail the number of rodents that tend to destroy crops and other material.” During the tenure of chief wildlife warden Richard D’Souza, there was an effort to establish a necessary protocol for volunteers involved in snake rescues. Some of them were recognised as honorary wildlife wardens by the forest department. However, post his retirement, the government did not take any step to nominate honorary wildlife wardens as well as recognise services of snake rescuers by issuing them identity cards. “Goa’s forest department should establish a protocol for wildlifers who are involved in rescuing snakes. Details of all snake rescuers should be compiled and identity cards should be issued to them only after scrutinising their honorary contributions,” Charan Desai, a member of Goa State Wildlife Advisory Board, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/app-launched-to-facilitate-speedy-snake-rescues/articleshow/87051699.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dussehra registrations for cars 3% more than pre-Covid days||MUMBAI: As many as 2,818 cars and 5,034 bikes were registered for a fortnight for deliveries during Dussehra here as people thronged to showrooms on Friday to take possession of new vehicles on the auspicious day. Although RTO officials said they received many registrations this year, it was still 13% less cars and 39% less two-wheelers, compared to Dussehra last year, just after the first wave of Covid-19. The only silver lining was that cars registered was 3% more than pre-Covid times (Dussehra 2019). Statistics showed that the total cars registered for Dussehra this time was 2,818, compared to 2,724 in pre-Covid times in 2019, and 3,254 during the same festival in 2020. The number of bikes registered for Dussehra deliveries this year was 5,034, compared to 7,077 two-wheelers during pre-Covid times in 2019 and 8,217 bikes during the festival last year. This Dussehra, most car and bike registrations were in the island city (765 cars and 1,522 bikes), while the least car registrations were in Wadala (604) and least bikes in Borivli RTO (995), state transport department statistics showed. “When it comes to motorcycles and scooters, registrations in the past two weeks were less than previous two years. It was 30% less than 2020 and 28% less than 2019. A major rush for cars and bikes was in 2020, immediately after the first wave of Covid, as many preferred personal vehicles for transport. It was also a good form of social distancing, compared to crowded public transport,” said a senior transport official. The purchase of new automobiles here usually peaks during Diwali, Dussehra, Gudi Padwa and Akshaya Tritiya. These are considered auspicious days for starting ventures, shifting to a new apartment, buying a new car/two-wheeler or buying gold (Dhanteras). Some applicants applied for special number plates, which come for a premium. Numbers are allotted through a computerised system, officials said. Despite less staff, RTOs at Tardeo, Wadala, Andheri and Borivli cleared all registrations on time. All new vehicles will have the new BS6 engines with better emission norms and dealers said they will affix high security registration number plates on vehicles. The transport department has empowered car and bike dealers to complete vehicle registration and fee payments with minimal involvement of RTO staff. The entire process being online, there is a less chance for corruption, officials said. “This has expedited registrations of new bookings and buyers are happy to get deliveries as per preferred scheduled dates,” a senior RTO official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dussehra-registrations-for-cars-3-more-than-pre-covid-days/articleshow/87050033.cms||Somit Sen

In Mohali, things were different. Effigies were lit at four places in Mohali and three places in Panchkula on Friday. However, Ramlila organisers said that there was a 50% reduction in effigy burning in Mohali this year. The main festival was held on the phase VIII ground in Mohali and Sector 5 in Panchkula. Celebrations were also organised at phases 1, 11 and Sector 78 in Mohali and at Sector 25 and MDC in Panchkula. Besides, small Ravana effigies were torched privately at many places in both cities. On the larger scale, Dussehra was celebrated at 14 places in Mohali district, down from 30 places last year. As large crowds gathered to watch the effigy burning, traffic snarls were witnessed at phase VIII, Mohali and Sector 5, Panchkula. In Mohali, police personnel were deployed on the road dividing Phases VII and VIII, where a part of the road was closed for some time as people parked their cars on the roadside to watch the effigy burning. Long queues of vehicles were seen on the road separating phase VII and VIII, Sector 70, Kumbhra Chowk, phase VII traffic light point, near the DC office in phase I and on the phase IX road. Chaos prevailed at the Sector 5 ground in Panchkula where police struggled to keep traffic going smoothly. While traffic was cleared within a few minutes of the festivities, the roads surrounding Sector 5 were packed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ravana-gets-fiery-send-off-in-pkl-mohali-holds-back/articleshow/87048135.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Festive bonding set to fan rise in Covid cases||MUMBAI: With all major Covid-19 curbs lifted in the state, health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state expects a surge in cases after Diwali. “We fear a surge or some spike will be seen after Diwali. We have opened up most facilities in the last two months and there is a strong possibility that a surge will follow,” said Tope. He added that preparations are on in full swing to meet any surge or third wave. Dr Shashank Joshi said there is a possibility of a “blip” post-Diwali, but it is unlikely to be the third wave. “Two weeks after Diwali, we may see an increase in cases because of all the mingling that will take place during the festival,” he said. Covid cases in the state have been declining since August, an average of 5,123 cases were reported daily in August which fell to 3,534 in September, further dropping to 2,450 in October so far. Cases in Maharashtra have been dropping, but gradual easing of restrictions and socialising in the festival season — Ganeshotsav to Diwali — may result in higher transmission. Dr Joshi said the state should now be ready for occasional “mini peaks” over the next few months if no new variant of concern emerges in the next few months. “Areas with high test positivity — Sindhudurg, Pune, Thane and Ahmednagar — have high test positivity results and should be watched closely for emergence of any new variants,” he said. The need of the hour is to first concentrate on zero Covid deaths. “We then have to map out areas with low vaccination coverage and carry out vaccination there.” People will have to use masks until April 2022 at the very least, he added. A senior official said that although the Centre’s advisory had predicted a third wave which will see higher cases than the second, with vaccine coverage improving in the state, it is likely that if there is a spike, the severity may not be as it was in the second wave. “Every time there is a festive season, it raises our concern and we start monitoring even the slight rise in cases carefully,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-festive-bonding-set-to-fan-rise-in-covid-cases/articleshow/87050226.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Chandigarh||Not many takers for MC’s 20 day permission for stalls||Deepak.Yadav@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: Permission to put up temporary stalls in markets and commercial areas for 20 days did not lure many traders, with the civic body authority receiving only three applications. Permission was granted to the applicants. The seven and three days’ permission category will be opened on October 25 and authorities are expecting good response from traders in these two categories. The civic body authority fixed two days, October 13 and 14 for businessmen and shopkeepers to take permission for installation of temporary stalls for 20 days. Per day fees for this was Rs 2,000 and those interested had to pay Rs 40,000 each. As only three persons turned up, the MC received Rs 1.20 lakh. “Although many people came to ask about the 20 days’ permission to put up temporary stalls, only three traders turned up. Since maximum people show interest in three and seven-day permission, we hope to get maximum requests that time. Earlier also, not many people expressed interest for 20 days’ permission as it is costly,” sources said. This time, the civic body authority has issued orders saying that pathways in markets and commercial sites be kept free of illegal encroachments during the festival season. “All parking spaces, pedestrian pathways and cycle tracks are kept free of encroachments and no such spaces is allotted to any person during the festival season”, the order says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-many-takers-for-mcs-20-day-permission-for-stalls/articleshow/87048189.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Mumbai||Covid vax facility at Mahim church set to wrap up||MUMBAI: After vaccinating close to 20,000 adults in the premises of one of Mumbai’s oldest churches — St Michael’s in Mahim — the BMC is set to end the same from next week. The civic-run drive, which began in May, is being wrapped up due to several reasons, one being reopening of schools. The church has a school adjoining it. Civic officials also said that many locals have already taken advantage of the facility and so they are cutting down on the number of micro-level centres now. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said that the centre had a capacity to vaccinate around 200-plus daily. “With Covid restrictions easing, and schools for higher grades and religious places too opening up, we felt there is need to shut the centre. Our staff, during the drive, has managed to vaccinate a large number of people from the locality,” he said. Parishioners meanwhile said that many who could not afford to take the paid vaccination, especially house helps, labourers and also senior citizens (which the parish has in large numbers) from nearby areas managed to get their shot in the six months of the drive. Rita D’Sa, a parishioner, said the drive began on Monday and they had locals and people from far off places like Santacruz and Vakola come to take the vaccine. “We covered the maximum number of people we could. The civic staff and doctors were also very cooperative... It helped many who could not pay to get vaccinated for free,” said D’sa. Parish priest Fr Lancy Pinto said that there was no distinction made and people of all faiths came to take the vaccine. “If the BMC saw some elderly persons who couldn’t walk, immediately a wheelchair would be arranged up to the gate and they would be taken on priority,” he said While St Michael’s Church, Mahim, is famous for the novenas it would conduct every Wednesday before the lockdown, the prayer service is still being held online. There are only regular masses for parishioners being conducted currently with limited seating. Local Shiv Sena corporator Milind Vaidya who coordinated with the BMC for setting up the vaccination facility at St Michael’s Church premises in May this year said that the drive was well received. “The spot was also convenient as well as large enough for Covid protocols to be followed,” said Vaidya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-vax-facility-at-mahim-church-set-to-wrap-up/articleshow/87050155.cms||Richa Pinto

The top brass of the VMC and the city police met again on Friday, despite it being Dussehra holiday, to discuss the issue. After announcements by chief minister Bhupendra Patel and state BJP chief C R Paatil, the civic body had swung into action against stray cattle. The police, elected representatives as well as BJP city unit members were also roped in the drive to free city roads of cattle but to no avail. The VMC has increased the number of teams operating in the city to impound cattle and has also started a massive drive to install RFID tags on bovine animals. Some cattle owners, however, have not got their cattle tagged. Also, there are some others who are leaving their cattle on the streets despite VMC issuing warnings of strict action. Officials of the city police will now be contacting cattle owners in their jurisdictions. The cattle owners will be given strict instructions that they should get their cattle tagged and ensure it does venture out on the streets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-respite-from-cattle-on-roads-vmc-plans-stricter-action/articleshow/87049285.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||South Delhi Municipal Corporation goes to NHAI again for using inert soil to construct road||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has contacted the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) afresh for using its inert soil or processed waste for constructing the main carriageway of Jaitpur-Ballabgarh bypass, besides using the material on the service road. SDMC claimed that it had got a study done by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) to ascertain the strength of the material. “Things look positive this time with NHAI compared with our past attempts. The agency expressed interest after we got the study done. They have allowed us to utilise the material for filling the service road. Regarding the main carriageway, they have apprehension about its strength, which is why we have sought permission to construct an 800-metre patch using this material on a trial basis. We are yet to get the nod for it. Based on the results, further decisions will be taken,” said an SDMC official. Compared with service lanes, a larger amount of inert or soil is used for filling the base of the main carriageway. Earlier, East Delhi Municipal Corporation had made a similar attempt and even signed an MoU with NHAI, but the project could not be implemented. Later, representatives from the office of the principal scientific advisor visited a service lane where the civic body aimed to construct an 800m road using inert material. But the work didn’t start due to lack of permission from the forest department to cut trees. To deal with the increasing mounds of inert, the civic body has engaged contractors for lifting it from the landfill and taking it to low-lying areas. “They are taking the material after processing and bio-mining of legacy waste through trommel machines. Till date, 2.75 lakh metric tonnes of inert has been transported to the NTPC eco-park and Tajpur Pahari,” said the official. Currently, 3,600 tonnes of municipal waste is generated from SDMC areas. While 50% is processed, the rest goes to landfill sites. The civic body aims to clean the landfill site by 2023 and dispose of 56 lakh tonnes of waste. It is targeting to start the waste-to-energy plant at Tehkhand by mid-2022 to process 2,000 tonnes of waste daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corporation-goes-to-nhai-again-for-using-inert-soil-to-construct-road/articleshow/87050156.cms||Vibha Sharma

The Congress accused the Centre of rendering people jobless by privatising every institution and department. During the protest, Chandigarh police arrested Congress leaders and took them to the Sector 26 police station, from where they were released later. Raising slogans, the protesters tried to cross over to unauthorised area. Police stopped them and arrested them when they refused to comply. Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said, “It is very sad that BJP is privatising all government institutions. Before coming to power, BJP and PM Modi assured people that nothing would be privatised, but they have stabbed the people of the country in the back with the current government privatising everything one by one.” Leader of opposition in the MC and senior Congress leader Devinder Singh Babla accused the Prime Minister of having corporatised the 200-year-old Ordnance Factory (Cable Factory) which employed 74,000 people.

---||Chennai||Man shot dead in ‘self-defence’ by cops in Tamil Nadu||TUTICORIN: In the second ‘encounter’ in a week in Tamil Nadu, police on Friday shot dead a history-sheeter wanted in 35 cases including seven murders near Muthiahpuram on the outskirts of Tuticorin on Friday. The accused, V Duraimurugan, 40, was killed when police fired at him in self-defence after he attacked two cops with a machete, Tuticorin superintendent of police S Jayakumar said. The history-sheeter of Koottaampuli near Pudukottai is the prime accused in the murder of M Jegadeesh, 23, of Sivagamipuram near Pavoorchatram in Tenkasi district on October 6. A 28-yearold man from Jharkhand was killed in an ‘encounter’ earlier this week in a chain snatching case near Chennai. Duraimurugan and his accomplices abducted Jegadeesh following a clash that arose between the two a couple of days prior to the murder. Sixteen cut injuries were inflicted on the youth before he was buried in Tirunelveli city. The body was exhumed earlier this week and a search was launched for the accused. “We launched a search for Duraimurugan as he is from our district,” SP Jayakumar told reporters after visiting the encounter scene on Friday afternoon. The SP’s special team led by sub-inspector Raja Prabhu got information that Duraimurugan along with two of his associates were in a hideout at Kovalam near Muthiahpuram. Jayakumar said that the SI was accompanied by three constables when they spotted Duraimurugan. “While his two accomplices fled, constable David Raja was chasing the history-sheeter. After running for about 50m he cut David Raja on the left hand with a machete,” the SP said and added that it was then the SI fired into the air and asked Duraimurugan to surrender. “But the history sheeter attacked Raja Prabhu, inflicted a cut on his left hand. As self-defense the SI fired three rounds at Duraimurugan. The accused was sent to the Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. His body has been kept at the hospital for autopsy,” the SP said. Police said that the SI had six bullets in his official 9mm pistol of which four were fired – a warning shot and three on the history sheeter. The injured police constable and SI were admitted to a hospital. The SP who inquired about the incident said the duo was in a state of shock. Jayakumar said that Duraimurugan has cases in eight districts over a period of two decades, for thefts, robberies, eve-teasing, abduction, murders and murder attempts. After spending nearly three-and-a-half years in jail he was released on September 3. The SP said special teams are on the lookout of two of Duraimurugan’s accomplices who fled the scene on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-shot-dead-in-self-defence-by-cops-in-tn/articleshow/87050152.cms||---

Farmers from Terai, at the heart of the resistance over the death of four farmers and a journalist, will not be joining to avoid flare-ups in the “sensitive” area. “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM, an umbrella body of farmer organisations) has called for putla dahan (effigy burning) on October 16 across the country. Upon our request, it has agreed to not include the Terai region in the plan because anti-social elements could cause communal tension,” Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk said in a video statement on Friday. The effigy burning is part of a nationwide farmers’ protest plan demanding that minister Ajay Mishra be sacked for “criminal conspiracy”. “The Terai region is sensitive at the moment. We don’t want to do anything that may cause a rift between people of different faiths. Many rumours targeting our community were spread after the Lakhimpur violence. We don’t want to give anyone a chance again,” Virk told TOI. “We have urged our Sikh brothers here to not join the effigy burning and stop one another from doing so.” The SKM had initially planned the effigy burning protest on Friday, coinciding with Dussehra. On Thursday, that was rescheduled to Saturday so that religious sentiments were not hurt. Responding to Virk’s call, local farmers said they will ensure no effigies are burnt in the region, which stretches across UP and Uttarakhand. “We want action against the minister but we also want to ensure religious sentiments are not hurt,” said Balhar Singh from Lucknow. Another leg of the farmers’ protest, the Asthi Kalash Yatra, meanwhile, continues. On Tuesday, the Antim Ardas Bhog, a funerary ritual, was conducted for the four farmers who died — Lovepreet Singh, Gurwinder Singh, Nachattar Singh and Daljeet Singh — and a memorial meeting organised for them and the journalist who was also killed that day, Raman Kashyap. Their ashes were then sent out across the country to be immersed in holy waters before the mahapanchayat planned on October 26 in Lucknow. “It is a Shahid Kalash Yatra,” said SKM spokesperson Jagtar Singh Bajwa. “After being taken across the Terai, the ashes will be immersed in the Ganga on October 23. We have also decided to build a memorial in honour of the five men on the land the Gurdwara committee owns at Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-terai-farmers-wont-join-effigy-burning-protest-to-avoid-flare-ups-says-sikh-body/articleshow/87046863.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In the last many years, Ludhiana residents had to eat sweets and other food items during Diwali that could have been adulterated, as reports of substantial number of samples collected by the health department usually came after the festival, defeatinf the purpose of such sample collection ahead of the festival. Assistant civil surgeon Dr Vivek Kataria said the delay in getting food sample reports during festive season has come to their notice. He added that he has asked the district health officer (DHO) to take necessary action in the matter and ensure that reports of samples come early. DHO Dr Rajesh Garg said there is only one laboratory for the whole of Punjab and it takes 15 days to get report from the Food Safety Laboratory in Kharar. He added that they do not have an alternative, as there they have only four analysts. The health department officer said, of the food samples sent by them, 20% to 25% samples fail the test and are either substandard, mixed branded, have misleading information about the food or even unsafe for human consumption. He added that About 5% food are unsafe for human consumption. Sources in the department said the gravity of the problem can be gauged from the fact that of about 70 food samples sent by the department for testing in September, report of about 25 samples was pending till recently. They added that majority of reports of the samples sent in October are yet to come. DHO said in a week they have taken more than 40 food samples from sweet shops, bakeries, grocery shops, milk and milk products shops, and sent the same to laboratory for testing. He added that they plan to take more than 100 samples in October. “The department must be tough on adulteration during festive season and book those selling unsafe food. However, if reports come after the festive season, it hardly matters if action is taken on the basis of such documents, as it is already late. So, in the interest of the health of the people, it is important that the department get reports of such samples at the earliest for prompt action,” said Narinder Singh, a city resident. Just one vehicle for taking samples in Ludh There are six food safety officers for the district, of which four are deputed in Ludhiana and outskirts whereas one each are for Khanna and Jagraon areas. But the department has just one vehicle for teams who go for sample collection. DHO said they need two more vehicles and have written to higher authorities about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/health-dept-tells-food-lab-to-expedite-sample-reports-to-prevent-adulteration/articleshow/87046885.cms||Shariq Majeed

The boy, Kushandeep Singh, was sitting in the lap of his elder sister at the time. He had gone to the fair with his mother Sharanjit Kaur and three elder sisters.Sahnewal SHO sub-inspector Balwinder Singh said the operator had refused to allow Kushandeep on the ride, considering his age, but his mother insisted, so his sister, aged 17, took him in her lap when the ride started. Kushandeep fell down and hit the grille installed around the ride as a safety measure. He was taken to a hospital, where doctors declared him dead. The Sahnewal police have proceeded with Section 174 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/joyride-turns-fatal-for-7-yr-old/articleshow/87046882.cms||---

SIT sources told TOI that a pistol owned by Ankit Das, a Lucknow-based contractor who was in a car part of the convoy that ran farmers over on October 3, and a repeater gun that belongs to Lateef, Das’s bodyguard, were found in Lucknow. The SIT had taken Das and Lateef, both of whom were arrested on Wednesday, to Lucknow in search of the arms they allegedly used while trying to escape the site after farmers were killed. “A pistol and a repeater gun belonging to the two accused were found in Lucknow. Both weapons are licenced,” a senior member of the SIT told TOI. “We can’t share information on whether shots were fired that day using these weapons. The status report of our investigation will be submitted to the Supreme Court.” The probe team then took Das and Lateef to a hotel at Gomti Nagar in Lucknow where Das and “other accused” reportedly put up after running away from Banbirpur, where eight people had died in the violence. SIT officials have taken CCTV footage of that night from the hotel. What the footage shows was not shared. “We are also investigating the role of Satyam Tripathi in the case,” the SIT source said. The FIR on farmers’ killings had named Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish as the main accused and “15-20 unidentified accused”. The SIT has made six arrests so far, including that of Ashish. One of the three men the SIT had said it was “looking for” right after arresting Ashish, Sumit Jaiswal, is still absconding. Jaiswal had filed the complaint on BJP workers’ killings, on the basis of which an FIR was filed. In a video that went viral, purportedly from the Kheri violence, Jaiswal, in a blue kurta, was seen coming out of the Thar that ran farmers over. He gave multiple interviews to news channels. The day the SIT was formed, he went missing and hasn’t been traced yet. Another suspect, Satyam Tripathi, who was in the second SUV (a black Fortuner) also, fled the spot. The owner of the third SUV (a white Scorpio) hasn’t been identified. Lakhimpur’s BJP MLA Yogesh Verma, meanwhile, questioned the role of the police present at Banbirpur on the day of the killings. “BJP worker Shyam Sundar was alive in police custody. It is negligence of the cops on duty that caused his death,” he said. When asked about the legislator’s accusations, ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI, “The investigation is pending. We will act on the basis of the investigation report and not someone’s allegations."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sit-seizes-firearms-owned-by-2-accused-to-probe-if-they-were-used-in-kheri-violence/articleshow/87046886.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Recently, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had raked up this issued and criticised LIT and Congress government for the decision. In a statement issued today, former minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “It is condemnable that the LIT was insulting the memory of late prime minster Atal Behari Vajpayee by deciding to rename the housing scheme. LIT should not to indulge in such narrow minded politics and we must rise above partisan political lines while commemorating the memory of towering figures like Atal Behari, who enhanced the nation’s prestige worldwide with their acts of statesmanship.” Asking the LIT to review its decision to rename the housing scheme, Grewal also said, “Other personalities can be given due recognition by naming some other scheme or project after them. We should however not send out a message that we disrespected the memory of Atal Behari in any manner whatsoever.” Grewal also advised the LIT to respect the sentiments of the citizens of Ludhiana, who also did not want the name of the housing apartment scheme to be changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-condemns-lit-decision-to-rename-atal-apartments-scheme/articleshow/87046892.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The NGT stated that as the matter was already being heard by the high court of Bombay at Goa, there could be contradictory directions if the NGT also hears the matter. The tribunal said that the HC’s jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution is a “vast and superior one”, and that a series of orders had also been passed by the bench. The NGT also said that the matter is still pending. The tribunal stated that there cannot be any parallel legal proceedings before it in the light of the comprehensive PIL pending before the high court. “The parallel exercise of jurisdiction by this tribunal may amount to vexatious exercise, and may result in passing of conflicting orders also. In the light of the above facts and circumstances, the tribunal is not inclined to consider the prayers sought for by the original applicant,” the NGT order states. A resident of Mashem had filed the applications before the NGT, stating that he is gravely concerned due to the dumping of the debris, about the threat of largescale destruction of environment, coast, sand dunes, sea and marine environment. However, the original applicant himself expressed his intention to withdraw the appeal as the construction of the bypass road for the national highway has been completed. The applicant said he was merely interested that those carrying out the highway improvement work should comply and adhere to the conditions of the CRZ clearance granted for the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-disposes-canacona-debris-dumping-matter/articleshow/87051476.cms||---

Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forests, told TOI that it is the mother of the two siblings — one female sub-adult trapped a few weeks ago and the other suspected to attack humans. The mother was trapped in a cage near Unit 13 in Aarey Colony where a teenager was attacked last week. “The rosette pattern of the trapped animal was matched with a picture of the suspected leopard that we have. The animal that was trapped on Friday is not the suspected animal,” he said, adding that she has been released. The sub-adult in captivity will be released after the one suspected of carrying out attacks is caught, said Limaye. For over a month a leopard has attacked humans at different places in Aarey Colony. The Thane forest division had sought permission to trap and tranquilise the animal. Krishna Tiwari, founder member of Forest and Wildlife Conservation, said he recently got a call from a resident of a slum colony in Aarey that a leopard was sighted in their area. “The man said the forest department had caught the wrong leopard as the one he had seen was very bold and moving around in human settlements... The forest department needs to increase patrolling and share their contact numbers so people can inform them at once of a leopard sighting,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-second-leopard-in-trap-but-turns-out-to-be-wrong-one/articleshow/87050355.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra's rural areas saw twice the vax turnout in urban hubs last week||MUMBAI: While the state’s vaccination drive has a gender gap, there is no urban-rural gap. During the first week of Mission Kawach Kundal between October 8 and 14, the share of vaccine doses administered in rural areas was far higher than in urban hubs. While 27.6 lakh vaccine doses were given out in rural areas in the week, 18 lakh urban residents got the vaccine. On October 12, while 2.66 lakh doses were given out in urban areas of the state, the rural pool was almost double at 5 lakh. State health minister Rajesh Tope said he is not surprised that rural vaccination is going on well. “Vaccination has always been a well-planned programme in rural areas because we have a good public health system there,” he said. While the healthcare system is more skewed towards the private sector in urban areas, rural areas depend on the public healthcare system. The Maharashtra rural healthcare system is an elaborate pyramid. “We have sub-centres at the bottom and one public health centre for every two to three sub-centres. Then there are rural hospitals and district hospitals as well,” said Tope. Also, there are enough human resources in terms of community workers to carry out vaccination-related awareness and programmes. It is not only Maharashtra, though, where rural areas have begun witnessing higher vaccination numbers. Dr Sachin Pandey, a Gandhi Nagar-based professor who maintains vaccine-related data for his website (https://covidtika herokuapp.com), said it is an all-India phenomenon. “After analysing data on the share of doses in rural areas between July and October 12, I found that rural areas got 66.45% of the total doses given,” said Pandey. He, though, said the number finally reflects the fact that India has a higher proportion of rural areas (around 65% of India is rural). “It can be said that vaccination in rural India is finally on par with the proportion of its rural population,” he said. During the initial part of the mass Covid vaccination drive, which started on January 16, the focus was on metro cities, which, due to high population density and frequent travelling habits, had turned into Covid hubs. But after the shortage of vaccines (in May and June) eased in July, the central health officials have steadily increased the allocation for the rural areas. In the May-June period, only 55% of the allocation went towards rural areas, said Pandey. “Most metro cities have already given the first shot to between 60% and 70% of their adult population. There’s now saturation in these areas and the states have to work out new ways to reach out to the unvaccinated people and get them vaccinated,” said Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-rural-areas-saw-twice-the-vax-turnout-in-urban-hubs-last-wk/articleshow/87050389.cms||---
---||Delhi||Killing unnerves Singhu border residents further||NEW DELHI: After a man was found killed at Kundli near the site where the farmers are sitting in protest at Singhu border, an uneasy calm prevailed there on Friday. There were fewer people milling around and only a few shops were open, fewer buyers still. The damaged police barricade on which the body of the man was propped up still lay at a roadside corner in the evening. The usual gaggle of people were present at the incident site, animatedly talking about the killing of the man whose hand had been chopped off before the body was tied to the metal barricade. The incident has unnerved the local residents. Praveen, who works in a garage, said, “Our work was already hampered by the protest and now this incident has caused more insecurity." Sadhu Ram, also a garage worker, chipped in, “We check the newspaper every morning with the hope that the government has come up with a resolution and this protest will end, but nothing has happened," Meanwhile, a forensic team along reached the spot with police personnel and scoured the area near the stage where the farmer's protest is centred. After 10 minutes of searching, they held discussions with a small group of protestors, including Nihang Sikhs, accused of being behind the killing. The local residents are not convinced that the farmers had nothing to do with the man’s death. They recalled that around 15 days ago, a labourer named Raju was thrashed by a group of protestors after an argument. One local alleged, “It was a petty issue and should have been solved through talks. Instead, the protesters beat the poor guy.” Praveen added, “They try to dominate the streets and if someone in the vehicle asks them to let them through, they threaten, ‘Bahut jaldi jaane ki hain (you want to leave Earth early)? They always threaten people.” Undeterred, from 2.30pm to 3.30pm, a group of Nihang Sikhs performed their usual daily rituals. Before dispersing, they tied two horses at the barricade where the man’s body had been found. According to the local business owners, travelling at night in the area is now uncertain. “After this incident, we will think whether we should walk around at night,” said Gulu, a local. Meanwhile, the farmers themselves were holding meetings among themselves to discuss the repercussions of the incident. Some talked about the video of the gruesome incident. They are determined not to let the latest circumstances derail their protest against the three central farm laws. On Friday, there were a number of them sitting determinedly near the protest dais, listening to speakers on the podium criticising the central government and motivating the protesters who have occupied the border since November last year.

Residents of Maksoodpur village in Syohara block said the ongoing Ramlila performance and the spirit of Dussehra also inspired them to accord the simian a dignified send-off. Residents garlanded the dead animal and formed a procession to carry it to the cremation grounds. Over 100 residents attended the last rites performed by a priest on the banks of Ramganga river on Thursday evening. A pyre was lit and all rituals that are observed after the death of a loved one were followed. The monkey was electrocuted to death when it came in contact with a high-tension wire. It was taken to a veterinary hospital for treatment but could not survive. Village resident and district panchayat member Jagveer Singh told TOI the village had a close bond with the monkey. “It lived in our village. We would give food to it every day. There was an attachment that we had developed with it,” he said. Nripendra Ravi, village pradhan said the monkey had died at a time when the entire town was caught in “religious fervour”. “We have a Ramlila performance going on. Monkeys are associated with Lord Hanuman, so we decided to do the cremation with full Vedic rituals,” said the village pradhan. Notably, in August, nearly 3,000 residents of Kurdi village in UP’s Saharanpur had pooled in money to perform the terahvi of a beloved bull. A week before that, a condolence meet was held for a crocodile in Gujarat’s Vadodara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/monkey-electrocuted-up-village-calls-priest-performs-cremation-with-full-rituals/articleshow/87046928.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Ludhiana||35% hike in input cost makes city’s casting industry boil over||Ludhiana: Casting industry and specially the owners of cupola furnaces are up in arms against the government for failing to control the rates of raw material like coal, chemicals and pig iron. According to businessmen, the rates of all the components has shot up so much that their cost of production for running the furnace has now increased by up to 35%. Unable to pass on the hiked cost to their customers, a lot of furnaces have deferred the production cycle — some are now operating once in three days while some are even operating once a week. Lashing out against the central government, Jagbeer Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Technology Park Cluster, said, “Those who have cupola furnaces are facing unrivalled situation as rates of all the components including coal, pig iron and chemicals have shot up exorbitantly. During last one month, the rate of coal has risen from Rs 32,000 to Rs 54,000 per tonne, while the rate of pig iron has shot up from Rs 42,000 per tonne to Rs 52,000 per tonne. The new rates of all these combined have caused increase of about 30% to 35% in the cost of running of the cupola furnaces. The electric furnace too have become costly affair to run. If a month ago, a casting unit owner was spending Rs 10,00,000 in operating his furnace at full capacity, he is now shelling Rs 13,50,000 due to the hiked cost.”Sokhi also added, “This is complete failure on the part of the central government. Whether it is coal, pig iron or chemicals, the manufacturers or suppliers of these products have no checks on them and they can increase their rates anytime. Despite our repeated representations to the government, no action is being taken in this regard and the rates are still on the rise.”According to Jatinder Nagpal, finance secretary of the Ludhiana Sewing Machine Industries Association, “The situation is such that we cannot afford to lose customers by passing on this increase to them, as demand for end products too is very low at present. With no help from the government, we already have delayed the productions and now those who used to run furnaces everyday are running them after a gap of 3-4 days, those industrialists who used to run them after 3-4 days are operating them once a week or 10 days.”According to Kulwant Singh, general secretary of Sewing Machine Development Club, “The worst sufferer of the increase in rates of coal, pig iron and chemicals is the sewing machine industry, as till date about 90% of our industry is dependant on cupola furnaces for meeting its demands for the parts. We are shocked over the silence of the central government, which has done nothing to bring down the rates of the raw material till now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/35-hike-in-input-cost-makes-citys-casting-industry-boil-over/articleshow/87046902.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Green corridor used to rush hands to hospital in 16 minutes||MUMBAI: For the 22-year-old Ajmer youth who went under the knife for hand transplants at Global Hospital, Parel, on Friday evening, an overnight journey to reach Mumbai was not a guarantee for the operation to be successful. It was just the start of the process. A couple of months ago too he had received an alert to be ready, but the hands were allocated to another hospital. On Friday, he reached Global Hospital around 7.30am to first submit blood samples for an important test called crossmatching. A crossmatch is done between the to-be donor and to-be recipient’s blood to rule out any antibodies and ensure compatibility. At the same time he was travelling to Mumbai, an official from Global Hospital’s Ahmedabad clinic travelled with a sample of the to-be donor’s blood. The crossmatch testing started around 10am and the results were out around 2pm, signalling that the transplant could be done. A transplant network with NOTTO and its regional (ROTTO) and state avatars (SOTTO) has made inter-state transplants easier. “Inter-state transplants have become organized in recent times. There is now a structure and deadlines for hospitals to respond to messages and every procedure is streamlined. Hospitals get alerts about the availability of donors in any part of the country in real time,” said Dr Akash Shukla of ROTTO. A team of doctors from Global also had to go to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital to retrieve the hands and travel back. “We will soon introduce the concept of local retrieval teams that stop the need for a transplant team to fly to other cities for surgery. It will take a few months for the plan to start,” said SOTTO-Maharashtra’s chief Dr Sujata Patwardhan, who heads the urology department of KEM Hospital. Before the city’s third transplant started on Friday, plastic surgeon Dr Nilesh Satbhai said the recipient got registered at Global Hospital in August. Global Hospital performed the city’s first hand transplant on August 28, 2020. The recipient was Kurla resident Monika More, who was 16 when she lost her hands in a train accident. The recipient of the second hand transplant was from Madhya Pradesh, 21-year-old Rahul Ahirwar, who underwent the operation at the BMC-run KEM Hospital, Parel, on August 12 this year. While Monika More’s surgery needed uniform cuts on both hands, the third recipient’s wounds are uneven. “His left hand has been amputated just below the elbow while the right above the elbow,” said Dr Sathbhai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-green-corridor-used-to-rush-hands-to-hospital-in-16-mins/articleshow/87050448.cms||---

The petition, filed by advocate Shekhar Jha, on behalf of two petitioners Swati Goel and Sajeev Newar, stated that "on the day of Dussehra, the body of a Dalit man Lakhbir Singh, was found hanging on police barricade in a mutilated condition... a protest which in itself is illegal cannot be continued when it is witnessing anti-humanitarian acts". The petitioners also referred to the largescale violence on the streets of Delhi on Republic Day and reports of alleged sexual assault on a woman at the protest site to seek immediate removal of the protesting farmers blocking the national highways linking Delhi to other states. The petitioners also said as per the Covid norms, no protests and large gathering of persons could be permitted. On October 4, the SC had questioned the rationale behind farmers continuing their protests, including blocking of national highways, when none of the three contentious agricultural laws are in force as all have been kept in abeyance for 18 months in January by the court after an assurance from the government to that effect. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar had said, "Why is the protest when the three laws are not in force at all? It has been kept in abeyance by the court. There is a stay. The government is also bound by the law enacted by Parliament, isn't it?" These observations had come on a petition filed by Kisan Mahapanchayat, which had sought permission to hold protests at Jantar Mantar near Parliament against the farm laws. It questioned the petitioner for moving the Rajasthan HC challenging the validity of the farm laws and simultaneously requesting permission to protest. On September 30, another bench of the SC headed by Justice Sanjay Kaul had cited its own ruling that barred protesters from blocking public roads and said farmers' grievances could be addressed either by Parliament or judiciary but they cannot be seen to cause harassment to commuters through sit-in dharnas on highways hindering traffic to and from Delhi to neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-plea-in-sc-against-farmers-protests/articleshow/87050433.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Sarabha Nagar police, who lodged an FIR on Thursday evening, suspect the involvement of an insider.The FIR was registered on the complaint of inspector Harkesh Meena from the office of commissioner of income tax (appeal unit), Ferozepur Road. The appeal unit has data of all those taxpayers who have disputes, besides draft orders and daily recordings of hearings. Inspector Meena said the department laptop stolen from appeal unit-4 was used on October 7, and was found missing on October 11. The police complaint was lodged on October 12 and after an inquiry the cops booked unidentified accused under Section 380 (theft) of the IPC.Sarabha Nagar SHO inspector Paramdeep Singh said sufficient security was deployed at the income tax office and police were suspecting the involvement of an insider as no one could enter and access any office equipment. The inspector added that between October 7 and October 11, only one to two outsiders had visited the office for an official work of data transfer. CCTV cameras were installed at the entrance of the office, but not inside. Prima facie, it appeared to be an insider’s job, he said. A source told the TOI, “It is a complete administrative failure of the Ludhiana I-T department that the official laptop of such a high-ranking officer has been lifted. Such an incident has never been heard of. What is more worrisome is that this laptop might contain sensitive and confidential information, like data of the taxpayers’ hearing of whose appeal cases were going on, important draft orders and daily recordings of hearings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/official-laptop-stolen-from-income-tax-office/articleshow/87046924.cms||---

He added that the state government failed to procure the coal stocks. Talking to TOI, Meghwal said the issue was discussed with home minister Amit Shah in the presence of all stakeholders and was resolved but the state government failed in mining coal even from its own coal fields. Meghwal, who is also in-charge of Vallabhnagar assembly elections for the BJP, claimed that we are going to win the seat very comfortably as we have sorted out some in-house issues. Congress is going to lose both the seats in bypolls, he added. On the issue of death of a Dalit man in Hanumangarh, he said that both Gehlot and Rahul Gandhi are doing selective politics comparing Lakhimpur and Hanumangarh incidences. It is the responsibility of Ashok Gehlot and Congress leadership to address the rising atrocity cases in Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/power-crisis-in-raj-result-of-failure-of-governance/articleshow/87050445.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Two shooters held, used GPS to track Yadav’s car||JAIPUR: Police on Friday arrested two of the four assailants who shot at and then smashed the head of history-sheeter Ajay Yadav in Bani Park on September 21. The accused were listed by police as Virendra Singh alias Billu and Ashish Shekhawat alias Akshay. DCP West, Pradeep Mohan Sharma said that four other accused have already been arrested in the case. Of the four shooters, Mukesh Yadav committed suicide on Thursday, while one other accused, Baljinder Singh alias Bava is absconding. Additional DCP, Ram Singh said that shooters had placed a GPS device in Yadav’s car to track his every moment. “They removed the tracker after killing Ajay Yadav,” he said. Singh said that Billu had purchased the tracker online for Rs 5,000 to keep a tab over Ajay Yadav. Their plans faced a roadblock when they could not find an opportunity to fit the GPS tracker on Yadav’s SUV. “The conspirators booked a hotel room overlooking Yadav’s house. On September 17, the accused finally found a chance and fitted the device inside Yadav’s car,” Singh said. Police said the accused had fitted the device on the vehicle’s chassis. Once they got real-time access to Yadav’s movements, the accused chose the central park as their meet-up location. For the next three days, the accused trailed Yadav. But they never found a perfect opportunity to execute their plan because Yadav was always accompanied by someone. On September 21, however, they found that Yadav’s car was moving towards Bani Park, behind a railway crossing, and decided to eliminate him there. “The accused fanned out on different locations after killing Yadav. But we had specific information about the location of both Billu and Shekhawat and nabbed them,” Singh said. A team of cops including Naresh Kumar, Narendra Khichad, Vasudev Singh and Rajesh Kumar, arrested the two accused. Singh said that two accused had come to Lalchandpura village near Panchyawala as they had run out of money. Jaipur police said that they have sought the help of Punjab police to arrest the remaining shooter Baljinder Singh alias Bava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-shooters-held-used-gps-to-track-yadavs-car/articleshow/87050440.cms||---

Dal and VHP leaders are said to have distributed knives to their activists and the photos of the programme have gone viral. However, Hindu organization leaders have denied the allegations of distributing weapons and claimed that it was just a symbolic programme of distributing ‘trishul’. VHP zonal secretary Sharan Pumpwell said, “Many people have been opposing the Trishul Deekshe programme organized by us. We have not distributed bombs or grenades. We organized Trishul Deekshe since we are worshippers of ‘Shakti’. We organized this programme during Ayudha Puja to instil confidence in workers and for the protection of religion. It is not against anyone and not aimed at harming people. Every year we have been organizing this programme, but due to Covid-19, the event was not held in the last two years.” He claimed that the trishul distributed on the occasion was not a lethal weapon. “We distributed trishul made of steel and it has no sharp edges to injure anyone,” he added. Reacting to the incident, the police commissioner told reporters there are reports of Trishul Deekshe programmes being held in many districts, including Dakshina Kannada. “We found during verification that they have been organizing the programme symbolically every year. I have directed officials to collect more details and take action if there is anything illegal in it. Organisers claim that it was just a symbolic programme followed every year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/distribution-of-knife-by-hindu-outfits-under-police-scanner/articleshow/87046933.cms||---

---||Delhi||Singhu horror: Farmer unions’ body slams killing, says the culprits must be punished||NEW DELHI: Seeking to distance itself from the ‘Nihang’ (order of Sikh warriors) group members who allegedly killed a farmer at Singhu Border protest site, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — a joint platform of farmer unions agitating for repeal of three central farm laws — on Friday condemned the incident and demanded that the culprits be punished as per law after investigation. “The Morcha is against sacrilege of any religious text or symbol, but that does not give anyone the right to take the law into their own hands. We demand that the culprits be punished according to law after investigating the allegation of murder and conspiracy behind sacrilege,” said the SKM in a statement, issued by its nine top leaders. It said, “As always, SKM will cooperate with the police and administration in any lawful action.” Sharing details on the deceased Lakhbir Singh who belonged to village Cheema Kala under police station Sarai Amanat Khan of Tarn Taran district in Punjab, the farmer leaders said, “A Nihang group at the scene has claimed responsibility, saying that the incident took place because of the deceased's attempt to commit sacrilege with regard to the 'Sarbaloh Granth'. It has been reported that this deceased was staying with the same group of ‘Nihangs’ for some time.” Disassociating themselves from the deceased, the SKM said the ‘Nihang’ group and the deceased person had no relation with the Morcha. In a video message, one of the SKM leader Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India claimed that the ‘Nihang’ group members had been gathered at the protest site despite the farmers leaders’ request to them to leave it on the ground that the place was meant for only farmers’ movement and not for any religious movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmer-unions-body-slams-killing-says-the-culprits-must-be-punished/articleshow/87050462.cms||---

---||Delhi||Singhu border killing: Victim father of three girls; relatives seek financial help||New Delhi: Lakhbir Singh, whose body was found at the site where the farmers are protesting at Singhu border on Friday, was the father of three daughters and had a troubled married life. The 36-year-old Titu, as he was also called, worked as a farm labourer but was believed to be a drug addict. His wife, Jaspreet Kaur, has lived at her matrimonial home for five years now with their three daughters, Tanya, 12, Sonia,10, and Kuldeep, 8. Titu lived with his aunt, Mohinder Kaur, with his widowed sister, Raj Kaur. Balkar Singh, one of the victim’s relatives, said Titu hailed from Kalas village in Tarn Taran and his father Darshan Singh had died around six years ago. “He took drugs and would steal to arrange for his next dose. It was due to his addiction that people refrained from hiring him for work at their houses, farms or other places,” said Balkar. Wondering how a person who was always inebriated had managed to reach Singhu, Balkar said, “He could not have gone there on his own. Somebody must have lured him with drugs or money.” While Jaspreet Kaur refused to speak to the media, Balkar said: “The government has to now think of his family and expose the persons behind his killing.” The deceased’s sister, Raj Kaur, claimed Titu used to interact with unknown Nihang Sikhs. She said she had no idea that he had gone to Singhu. “On October 13, he told us he was going to the grain market and since we had no news of him till today morning,” she said. Balwinder Singh, SHO of Punjab Police’s Sarai Amanat Khan police station, said Lakhbir didn’t have any criminal record and the cops could not confirm either the 36-year-old man was actually a drug addict. “We don’t have any cases registered against him. But people say that he used to consume bhang and other intoxicants,” the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/victim-father-of-three-girls-relatives-seek-financial-help/articleshow/87050505.cms||---
---||Delhi||Criminals have taken over stir against farm laws, says BJP||NEW DELHI: Criminals have taken over the agitation against the new farms laws and the agitators have lost the moral right to call themselves farmers, BJP said on Friday following the murder of a Taran Taran Dalit resident, allegedly by Nihangs who were part of the protests at the Singhu border. BJP said agitators should withdraw the protests unconditionally and hold talks with the government immediately.  “The agitators lost every moral right to call themselves farmers. It’s time saner elements, if any, among them apologise to the nation and withdraw and engage with the government unconditionally,” BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh tweeted. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia questioned, “How can someone who brutally kills our loved ones be called a farmer? How can a farmer insult the tricolour? How can you call someone a farmer who rapes our sisters?” He was referring to the incident at Red Fort on Independence Day and the rape of a volunteer from West Bengal, who later died. Party’s general secretary and in-charge for Punjab, Tarun Chugh, said the "gruesome murder" of an innocent person at the Singhu border clearly established that criminal elements have overtaken the farm agitation. “Any kind of crime on the place of protest by farmers is an alarming signal and the brutal murder indicated that all is not well with the intent of the agitation,” Chug said and added, “Farmer leaders should own up the responsibility of criminal activities on the scene of protest and should make sure that criminals surrender themselves.” BJP’s IT department head Amit Malviya said, “Rape, murder, violence and anarchy... All this has happened in the name of the peasant movement.” “Anarchists behind these protests in the name of farmers need to be exposed,” Malviya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-criminals-have-taken-over-stir-against-farm-laws/articleshow/87050479.cms||---

---||Meerut||Many west UP districts have ‘very poor’ air quality: CPCB data||MEERUT: With winter about to set in and pollution levels assuming alarming proportions during the morning hours, those out for a walk in many areas of west UP are at a risk of getting their lung health affected. Track the pollution level in your cityAs per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, many districts like Meerut, Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad and Noida fall into 'very poor' category as far as air quality is concerned. The AQI of prominent pollutant PM2.5 hovers between 200 and 300 in many areas, causing breathing issues due to prolonged exposure, which further slides down to 'very poor’ category (300-400 range) "during late nights and early mornings", causing respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Areas like Hapur which were in the 'moderate' category (PM 2.5 between 100 to 200) also slid to 'very poor' category on Friday morning. The only silver lining is that the pollution levels are low compared to previous years. For instance, in mid-October last year, Meerut had already plunged into the 'severe' category (400-500) and so had several other NCR districts. Health experts have meanwhile cautioned morning walkers to take precautions while venturing out. “With temperatures plummeting in the coming days, morning walks should be avoided as the air is no longer healthy in the morning. Late evenings and early mornings are highly toxic during winter. AQI turns ‘poor’ during this time as the air becomes heavy and suspended PM10 and PM2.5 cause breathing discomfort. People should go for a walk only when it is sunny because pollution levels drop after the sun rises. Windy days are still better as it helps transport pollutants,” Meerut-based physician Dr Harish Mohan Rastogi said. Aggravating the problem is stubble burning, one of the major reasons for rising pollution levels in the previous years. Incidentally, the UP government announced withdrawal of all 868 cases it filed against farmers across the state for burning straw saying "farmers play an important role in the development of our economy", as mentioned in the official statement of state home ministry. The cases were registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health), 290 (punishment for public nuisance) and 291 (continuance of nuisance after injunction to discontinue) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/many-west-up-districts-have-very-poor-air-quality-cpcb-data/articleshow/87047038.cms||Sandeep Rai

Meanwhile, the talks of local MP and founding member of Rastriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), Hanuman Beniwal, with the district SP remained inconclusive.

"He was referred to a hospital in Jodhpur from where his family took him to a hospital in Ahmadabad. However, the youth succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday. Since then, the locals have been protesting sitting with the dead body," said a senior police official on Friday. Unhappy with the investigation, local MP Beniwal said, "We are protesting and demanding for arrests, but the police have failed to take any action against the accused," he said. Beniwal said the local administration should be sensitive and fulfil the demands made by the family of the deceased. "If the family fails to get justice, we will jam the highway and organise demonstrations at the district collectorate," he added. The demands of the protestors included arrests of the accused, and suspension of circle officer, Mundwa, who took the case lightly along with ex-gratia of Rs 20 lakh to the family of the deceased. They also demanded that the Bhanvanda police SHO should be sent to the lines and the investigation of the case should be handed over to a senior official. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/protests-continue-over-death-of-25-year-old-nagaur-youth/articleshow/87050495.cms||---

The government is in touch with Russia, China, US and several regional countries for the conference which is likely to take place here in the second week of November. A final confirmation from the conference invitees is awaited. According to sources, India has proposed that the conference be held on November 10 or 11. While there are no plans yet to invite the Taliban for the conference, an invite to Pakistan is not ruled out. ToI has also learnt that India had, in fact, planned a similar conference in May this year with the participation of the then Afghanistan government and also Pakistan but the Covid-19 second wave put paid to the plans. The situation is a lot more complex now of course with the Taliban having taken over the country. The conference in India will follow the Moscow Format talks on October 20 for which Russia, like it has in the past, has also invited India. Just before the Moscow Format, Russia's extended troika that includes US, China and Pakistan will also have a meeting. The conference in India is likely to carry forward the agenda of the Moscow Format talks and will look to ensure a more inclusive government in Afghanistan while emphasising on the need for the Taliban to ensure that the Afghan territory is not used for cross-border terrorism. PM Narendra Modi has himself said that the government in Afghanistan is not inclusive and that the international community should not rush into recognising it. The conference will also provide India an opportunity to underline the significance of the August 30 UNSC 2593 resolution that the government believes should shape the world's agenda in Afghanistan. Senior government officials are expected to participate in the meeting which will also underscore the need for Afghanistan to have unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-plans-own-conference-on-afghanistan-in-november-may-invite-pak-too/articleshow/87052977.cms||Sachin Parashar

---||Delhi||A rare delight: Flock of 53 Egyptian vultures sighted in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A flock of 53 Egyptian vultures, a rare sight in the capital, were spotted on a sandy mid-island on the Yamuna this week. Egyptian vultures have been listed as an endangered species in the IUCN list of threatened species. As vultures are scavengers, they play an important role in the ecosystem. T K Roy, an ecologist who spotted the flock, said his field observations over the years revealed that the population of Egyptian vultures had been gradually rising. A flock of 25 Egyptian vultures was recorded in 2018, followed by a flock of 35 in 2019 and 42 in 2020, he added. “Egyptian vultures prefer isolated places for roosting or resting. In Delhi, I have mostly recorded them on some middle islands on the Yamuna, apart from Bhatti Mines and Ghazipur landfill areas,” said Roy, who is also the state coordinator of Asian Waterbird Census. “They are not seen throughout the year in the city due to disturbance (feral dogs and human intervention) and lack of food. Habitat loss is another major factor as the vultures do not find safe and isolated islands on the Yamuna when there is a fluctuation in the water level.” He said Egyptian vultures were mostly spotted between September and January. “The population is slowly rising because of the complete ban on diclofenac and growing awareness among people on vulture conservation,” said Roy. Diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory drug that has a toxic effect on vultures. Besides their normal food habit of consuming carrions, the species now feeds on available dumped bio-degradable garbage at the dumping grounds, Roy added. Surya Prakash, a retired scientific officer at JNU and an environmentalist, said, “Egyptian vultures with dark grey bill is a migratory (winter) while the other one with pale yellow bill is a resident. In February 2019 and 2020, on Big Bird Day, our team counted 53 and 47 Egyptian vultures on electrical pylon on Gurgaon-Faridabad Highway.” Southern Ridge, JNU, Sanjay Van, Neela Hauz, Asola, Bhatti Mines, Ghazipur Mandi, Aravalli Biodiversity Park and Yamuna Biodiversity Park are the main hotspots to observe Egyptian vultures in Delhi, he added. Sohail Madan of Bombay Natural History Society said, “Egyptian vultures, once a common sight in Delhi, have now become rare. They have been uplifted from vulnerable to endangered species in the IUCN list.” Eurasian griffon, Himalayan griffon and critically endangered red-headed vulture have also been photographed in Delhi in the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-rare-delight-flock-of-53-egyptian-vultures-sighted/articleshow/87050564.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The district has been picked up for a project on AI by the computer chipmaker. Dahod is amongst the aspirational districts identified by the central government. Such districts are the most developmentally challenged districts of the country. Dahod and few other districts in the state have been selected in order to develop AI skills in students of the region. Districts from North-East India and other parts of the country too have been included in the project. Kajal Dave, Dahod district education officer, said that the district’s top five schools in terms of student strength were selected for the project. “The students were introduced to the basics of AI. In future they can take up further studies in the field,” she said. The schools that were selected for the project include M Y High School in Dahod, S R School in Devgadh Baria, Pragati Girls High School in Limkheda, Shri I K Desai High School in Fatepura and G L Sheth High School in Singvad. Dave said that parameters like gender equality and representation of various areas of the district were kept in mind while selecting the schools and students. Principal of the S R School, J J Patel, said that students from Class IX to XII were introduced to basics of AI through online interactions. “Some students who look promising will be picked up for further training,” he said. Principal of the M Y High School, Bharat Jadav, said that they will try to provide equipment needed for the project. He said that they were awaiting the names of the students who were selected for further training.

The party also demanded that the health minister apologise. Congress’ attack came after former PM Manmohan Singh’s daughter, Daman Singh, accused Mandaviya of getting a photographer against the wishes of the family. Daman Singh said her mother was very upset because a photographer had entered the room along with Mandaviya, but when she insisted that the photographer leave the room, “she was completely ignored”. “She was very upset. My parents are trying to cope in a difficult situation. They are elderly people. Not animals in a zoo,” Daman Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-slams-mandaviya-over-photo-op-while-visiting-manmohan-at-hospital/articleshow/87052996.cms||---

It also extended full support to PWD minister Mohammed Riyas for taking an open stand against contractor-politician nexus. Addressing the media after the meeting, CPM’s acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan told reporters that the chief minister explained in detail the importance of the SilverLine project. “Pinarayi Vijayan clearly stated all details regarding the project in the assembly. He explained the rationale behind the project and government outlook towards the same in such a way that anybody could hardly harbour further doubts on the importance and need of this project,” he said. Vijayaraghavan also appealed to the opposition to give up ‘unrealistic apprehension’ towards the project. He said the accusations levelled by critics were politically motivated and government will go ahead with the project with public support. “You people may remember the opposition to GAIL pipeline project. There were widespread protests. Now people are ready to surrender properties for development projects. Now, they are getting higher compensation for their land and property. People are given Rs 4,000/sq ft compensation for their buildings whereas the construction cost per sq ft in state is less than Rs 2,000. There is no genuine public resistance,” Vijayaraghavan said. The acting party secretary said those who oppose SilverLine citing the cost factor should understand that the benefits of the project will be felt in all spheres of development. “One should not assess the viability of public infra projects only in terms of revenue. The development and investment it could trigger is something phenomenal,” he said. Vijayaraghavan said the PWD minister said nothing wrong by asking MLAs to not meet him with contractors responsible for works outside the constituency limits of the MLAs concerned. “What Riyas said is LDF’s policy. Things should get done without recommendations. Ministers give due importance to issues raised by MLAs. Government has a policy on how the office of ministers should function. CPM has a stand on how the government and ministers should function,” he said. The Secretariat expressed satisfaction over the progress of Life Mission project. Government, under its 100-day programme, completed the work of 12,067 houses for homeless people. At this rate, government will be able to complete the work of one lakh houses in a year, he said. Vijayaraghavan said 99% of CPM branch committee meetings were over; 35,179 branch meetings have been completed. A month-long local committee meetings would be held in the coming month. In view of Covid-19, CPM has replaced public meetings with virtual meetings. Artistic, literary competitions in connection with party conferences are now held on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-backs-riyas-remarks-against-mlas/articleshow/87052540.cms||---
---||Goa||Casino entry prohibited for Goans considering evil consequences: HC||PANAJI: The high court while dismissing the petition challenging the restrictions on non-tourists entering casinos in Goa, held that the state government’s curb is “justifiable for the reasons advanced by the state of Goa”. “It is in the public interest of residents of Goa so also in the interest of the state for justifiable reasons. Thus, the decision to prohibit entry for persons other than tourists...is a conscious decision of the state, considering its evil consequences on its subject,” the high court held. The court held that the object of the state is naturally to prevent persons domiciled in Goa to be lured into such chance games and cause their families to suffer poverty and mental trauma. Such classification of persons as domiciled in Goa and tourist holding tourist permit is well-founded,” the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated. “The classification between tourists who come to Goa for a few days to entertain themselves and locals domiciled in Goa is based on an intelligible differentia,” the court stated. Advocate general Devidas Pangam stated that being a welfare state it must also see that youth be protected and do not over indulge or get addicted to such activities involving chance or luck. In the absence of restrictions, persons in Goa may suffer poverty, which ultimately will hamper economic and social development of the state where the families of such persons may also be required to suffer financial loss. “Tourists come to Goa for a short period of leisure and relaxation and so the opportunity of access is limited. However, if persons domiciled in Goa are allowed, it may have an adverse effect on society,” Pangam submitted. The petition filed by a final year law student Shukr Usgaonkar challenged the provisions of the Goa Gambling Act which makes it an offence for non-tourists to partake in gambling activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/casino-entry-prohibited-for-goans-considering-evil-consequences-hc/articleshow/87051045.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Goa||In a first since 2018, Goa clears Rs 25 lakh incentives for IT firms||PANAJI: The state government has released Rs 25.3 lakh as incentives to three IT companies, three whole years after the Goa IT Policy, 2018, was formulated. This is the first time that the department of information and technology has ever released any incentives under the policy. The empowered committee, headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant, approved the disbursal of Rs 4.5 lakh for Transerve Technologies, Rs 10.5 lakh for Online Productivity Solutions and Rs 10.3 lakh for Inbetween Software Development. The committee, which includes IT minister Jennifer Monserrate and two other industry representatives, also gave an in-principle nod for Rs 30.3 lakh to be disbursed to Sapna Group, subject to certain conditions being met and documentary compliances. The department of information and technology had received 25 applications for incentives, of which 10 were screened and approved by its internal review committee. The panel rejected 12 applications and withheld one for further scrutiny, while two applications required additional documentation. “It gives me immense joy to announce that the Goa IT department has approved nine incentive schemes under the lT Policy 2018 for three Goan companies,” said Monserrate. “By providing these incentives, the government strives to support IT companies in the state and boost Goa’s position on the map as a powerhouse of IT.” The meeting was held at the forest department’s office at Altinho, Panaji. Department officials say that most of the IT companies are applying for subsidies on lease rentals, power and internet, campus recruitment assistance, and land built-up rebate incentives. “Most of the companies are employing Goans so they got close to 100% of the incentives. But the response from the IT companies is not great. More companies need to come forward,” said an official. While Goa has at least 100 startups and IT companies, just 21 firms applied for registration under the IT Policy, of which 15 were approved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-1st-since-2018-goa-clears-rs-25l-incentives-for-it-firms/articleshow/87051082.cms||---

The DGP also said that following his instruction even small crimes are now being registered. Stating that forensic science is required for investigation right from the time a crime takes place, Meena said that they have a shortage of experts. “Goa police still sends many samples to other places for forensic tests. We don’t have a facility for conducting DNA and fingerprinting tests at the Goa Forensic Science Laboratory,” he said, reiterating that some investigations can be done through forensic science only. Further, highlighting the need to strengthen the mobile forensic unit, the DGP said, “Instead of collecting samples and sending them to the laboratory, if the mobile van goes to the site, it helps speed up the investigation.” Meena said that when he joined Goa police there was reluctance to register crimes. But following his instruction, now even minor crime cases are being registered. “We have even suspended two police persons for not registering a crime. Their mentality has changed, and they have started registering cases,” he said. When asked about the action being initiated by police with respect to enforcing of Covid protocols in view of the festive season and increased tourist footfalls, he said that his department is ensuring that Covid guidelines are strictly followed. Goa police have fined those violating Covid norms and our force is patrolling beaches, too, Meena said. “To further strengthen enforcement, eight vehicles have been procured, which will be allotted to coastal police stations.” Asked if the department will need to bring in additional police force in view of the increased crowds at this time of the year, the DGP replied in the negative. “Goa police’s recruitment drive is in the advanced stage and they (new recruits) will be roped in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forensic-university-will-benefit-goa-police-says-dgp/articleshow/87051093.cms||---

Jaishankar will hold talks with his counterpart Yair Lapid, who is the alternative prime minister and foreign minister in the new coalition government that came together after Israel went through about five elections in just over two years. Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party, is scheduled to take over the rotating premiership from Bennett in 2023.

The India-Israel relationship is one of the closest — the ties span areas that are of critical importance for India’s development. These include agriculture and water, with Israel having become one of India’s key agriculture partners, infusing technologies and methods that could transform India’s agriculture while providing solutions for a water-stressed country. In the security and defence fields, India and Israel have been working together, more so since India’s security challenges multiplied with the stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh. But it may be time to graduate to the next level, and that will be indicated during the visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaishankar-to-visit-israel-next-week/articleshow/87053013.cms||---

QMC has invited an expression of interest (EOI) from qualified and experienced agencies to carry out the work. The work includes mapping of underground utilities such as water pipelines, sewerage lines and electricity cables using penetrating radarfor a length of 40 km. Aerial survey will be conducted covering 1.9 crore sqm of the municipal area, whereas entire municipal roads will be scanned using GPR at a grid of 10m. Other benefits such as number of illegal structures will be accessible with the hi-tech system and all the existing structures will be updated as entire area of municipal council will be digitalised by preparing ward maps. House numbers will be linked to survey numbers. The agency will visit every house and shop to check trade licence, house tax, sanitation fee and property tax. The GIS system will include data about people such as population, income or education level. It will also include information about the landscape such as the location of streams, various kinds of vegetation and soil. The GIS technology will also enable authorities in rapid planning and taking rational and informed decisions in this regard. With the GIS technology, people can compare the locations of different things in order to discover how they relate to each other. A single map could include sites that produce pollution such as factories and sites that are sensitive to pollution such as wetlands and rivers. A map would help the people determine where water supplies are most at risk. Three council staff members will be trained by the agency in Autocad and Google Earth software.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-to-install-tech-for-mapping-roads/articleshow/87051145.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The temple is located at Velus village in the Valpoi municipal area. The process of locking the temple was underway till the evening. There are three Mahajan families affiliated to the temple — Gaonkar, Madvol and Gurav. According to the Gaonkar group, all three families have the right to perform rituals in the temple. However, they claim that members of the Gurav group are trying to control the temple and not allowing the Gaonkars and Madvols to participate in major religious ceremonies. On Friday, breaking the annual tradition of gathering in the temple at 3pm for Dussehra, members of the Gurav group came in at 1pm itself and started the celebration. This turned into a controversy after a verbal spat erupted between the Gaurav and the Gaonkar groups. Gawas unsuccessfully attempted to pacify both groups and finally decided to lock the temple to avoid any untoward incident. Police too were also deployed at the temple premises. Interestingly, just a day earlier, on Thursday, the Gaonkar and Madvol groups had submitted a memorandum to Gawas complaining that the Gurav group is not allowing them to perform major rituals in the temple.  The mamlatdar had said that all community members have the right to perform the rituals and assured to look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-temple-locked-after-grps-clash-over-dussehra-festivities/articleshow/87051210.cms||---

Besides the ASI security personnel, the two persons hired by the Church keep a close eye on tourists to remind them to keep their masks on and follow social distancing, as well as provide them with shawls to cover up if they are immodestly dressed. “Things are returning to normal, and on weekends, we see a rush of tourists,” parish priest Fr Rosario Oliveira said. “We have put precautionary measures in place. The two personnel the Church has engaged work between 9am and 5pm inside the Cathedral and at the entrance, to check that visitors follow SOPs and maintain the sanctity of the place,” he added. Many tourists visit the Old Goa complex after visiting beaches, and the Church is ensuring that visitors maintain the decorum of the place and don’t touch surfaces unnecessarily or sit on benches and talk. Those who want to pray are permitted to do so. “It shouldn’t be treated as just another tourist destination. The sacredness of the church should be maintained,” he added. A check is also being kept on tourist guides, who draw a crowd of tourists around them. After finding that these guides were not sharing accurate information with tourists, Church authorities have decided to hold a session on October 18 especially for the guides, to share information with them about the Se Cathedral’s history and architecture. “I want to explain the rich architecture style and religious significance of the cathedral to the tourist guides, so that they can portray a correct picture of the cathedral,” Oliveira said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/se-cathedral-hires-special-staff-to-ensure-tourists-observe-covid-sops/articleshow/87051230.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Data from the power exchanges for October 13 show producers and state transmission companies selling electricity at Rs 16-18 per unit against the usual rate of Rs 4-6 prevalent before the coal shortage hit generation units. Transmission Corporation of Telangana Ltd and Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd were the top two sellers, commanding a tariff of Rs 16 and Rs 15 per unit, respectively. Sembcorp was the third-largest seller overall and first among private power producers, commanding a price of Rs 16 per unit. Jaypee Nigre Thermal Power Plant, Raipur Energen, Raigarh Energy Generation Ltd and Jindal Power Ltd got a tariff of Rs 17 per unit. The highest tariff of Rs 18 per unit was commanded by Hindustan Power Ltd, Adani Power Stage-II and Teesta Stage-III, the last one a record of sorts for hydel power. The tariffs on the exchanges are guided by the market principle of demand and supply and depend on the situation at a given time when buy/sell bids are made. The coal shortage has forced about 5 gigawatts of generation capacity to back down, creating a rush of buyers on the exchanges. A 30% reduction in imported coal-based generation has further aggravated the situation. At a meeting last week with representative of Tata Power, Adani Power, Essar Energy, which have imported coal-based plants, and officials of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Maharashtra, which have power pacts with these plants, Kumar said it was the responsibility of the power producers to stock fuel and not providing availability of generation capacity on any pretext was “inexcusable”. He asked states to use all possible contractual and other available legal interventions against wilful refusal of capacity and also watch out for gaming by generators. “If any gaming is noticed on the part of the seller such as not supplying under PPA and selling in market (it) should be brought to notice of regulatory commission under intimation to the ministry without any delay,” he said. Tata Power and Adani Power have both shut down their plants, each with 4,000 MW capacity, at Mundra in Gujarat. Tata Power said it was unable to supply power at tariffs in PPA as there was under-recovery of Rs 2.50 per unit due to a spike in international coal prices. Adani Power said it was waiting for coal stock and would be ready to supply power at pass-through tariff as prescribed in its PPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-power-generation-falls-transmission-companies-private-producers-make-a-killing-on-exchanges/articleshow/87053068.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Campus classes for 1-5 in late October or early November||Bengaluru: Nearly 19 months after they were closed due to the outbreak of Covid-19, classes 1 to 5 are set to reopen for in-person learning in the last week of October or the first week of November. The classes are currently held online. Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh said the Karnataka government is ready to reopen the lower primary classes and the date will be fixed based on the recommendations of Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC). CM Basavaraj Bommai is expected to convene a TAC meeting in a couple of days. ‘Situation is conducive for offline classes’ DPI has convened a virtual meeting on schools’ preparedness on October 18. “The required preparations have been made and we are waiting for the CM’s nod,” Nagesh said. TAC chairperson Dr MK Sudarshan said: “The ground situation is conducive for reopening of classes. We are ready with our recommendations and waiting for the CM to call a meeting.” Sources said offline classes will be held for half a day thrice a week with 50% occupancy. “The staggered approach is essential to ensure one-metre distance between students and at least a two-metre distance between teachers and the first row of students,” an official said. Sources said the TAC was looking at reopening classes on October 25, while a few education officials prefer a post-Diwali restart. The Dasara vacation ends on October 20, and mid-day meals at schools will resume from October 21. Additional chief secretary (health) TK Anil Kumar said the government will request the TAC for its recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/campus-classes-for-1-5-in-late-oct-or-early-nov/articleshow/87052149.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Institutions have been instructed to conduct classes by accommodating all students in postgraduate classes. For degree students, institutions can group students into batches and conduct classes on alternate days or conduct daily classes if enough classrooms are available. Colleges can use their discretion in this regard. Science practical classes will be permitted. College authorities should ensure that classrooms, laboratories, libraries, toilets and waiting rooms are disinfected. They should also ensure that Covid protocols are followed by students. Special camps should be readied for organizing special vaccination drive on campus. The guidelines say that colleges can conduct classes in single session, from 8.30am to 1.30pm. If this is not feasible, colleges may choose from 9am to 3pm, 9.30am to 3.30pm or 10am to 4 pm schedules. College councils can take a call on the timing. Engineering colleges may continue the six-hour regular classes schedule. All teaching-non-teaching staff should report to duty. All student hostels should be open and Covid Jagratha committees, involving teachers, students, parents, health, local body representatives and police should be set up for the safe conduct of classes. Pregnant and lactating mothers among students can be given entry to classrooms, provided they are vaccinated. Students who are below the eligible age for vaccination or who have received only one dose of vaccine can also be permitted in classrooms. In case there are teachers or students who haven’t taken vaccine for no valid reasons they may not be permitted to enter the campus. Students with any sort of disease and differently abled students may attend classes only two weeks after the college reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/colleges-to-fully-open-from-mon/articleshow/87047622.cms||---
---||India||Karnataka orders survey of churches to ‘check forced conversions’||BENGALURU: The legislature committee on backward classes and minorities welfare in Karnataka has asked for a survey of churches in the state in a bid to weed out the “unauthorised” ones and “check forced religious conversion.” Various government authorities and the deputy commissioners of districts have been instructed to conduct the survey. Goolihatti Shekhar, BJP MLA from Hosadurga, who chaired the committee’s meeting on October 13, told TOI that the survey aims to check “forced religious conversion which is rampant in some parts of Karnataka” including his home district Chitradurga. He said the representatives of the backward classes and minorities affairs, home, revenue and law departments had stated at the meeting that there are about 1,790 churches in Karnataka. The committee has asked them to find out how many of them are illegally established, he said, adding that according to the home department, 36 cases of forced conversion have been registered across the state. “The menace of forced conversion is so rampant that the perpetrators are even converting residences into churches and Bible societies. We need to find out the number of such establishments and unauthorised Christian priests and take action against them,” said Shekhar. Shekhar said the churches and Bible societies, which have not been registered and lack permission of the directorate of minorities welfare or minorities commission, are considered ‘unauthorised.’ The Archdiocese of Bengaluru Rev Peter Machado, however, opposed the state government’s move to survey Christian missionaries and their places of worship. Machado said the exercise is unnecessary. “With this, our community places of worship as also pastors and sisters will be identified and may be unfairly targeted. We are already hearing of such sporadic incidents in the north and in Karnataka,” he said. “If Christians are converting indiscriminately then why is the percentage of Christian population reducing regularly when compared to the others? Why is the government interested in making surveys of religious personnel and places of worship only of this community? We are sad that CM Basavaraj Bommai succumbed to pressure from fundamentalist groups” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-orders-survey-of-churches-to-check-forced-conversions/articleshow/87053115.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Rain plays spoilsport on festival day in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Thundershowers that have bothered Bengalureans through this week are likely to continue till Sunday and the minimum temperature will drop to 20 degrees celsius. The city witnessed a downpour on Friday evening with Jnanabharathi, the Bangalore University campus area, receiving 68.5mm of rainfall. Winds reaching 30-40 kmph slammed Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara and Kolar districts. The rain on Thursday night left several areas like Madiwala, Anekal, parts of Electronic City, HSR Layout and some areas in Bommanahalli, inundated, leaving citizens to cope with the havoc amid Ayudha Puja celebrations. More than 45 homes were flooded and at least 30 cars partially submerged in water. After recording below average rain in August and September, the city received 57 per cent excess rain in October. In all, 265.8mm rainfall has been recorded so far against an average of 168.3mm. “This is the first time after nearly 100 years that we recorded such heavy rainfall in October,” said an official of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre. He added: “We have received complaints of several apartment basements getting filled with water.” ‘We could barely step out’Prabhavathi Kumar, a resident of HSR Layout whose car was half-filled with water, said she was upset at not being able to celebrate the festival. “With continuous rain, roads across HSR Layout were water-logged and we could barely step out even to move our cars,” she said. On Thursday morning, she went out to do puja for her car and noticed that the engine was damaged. Ravikanth Suresh C, another resident of Anurgraha Layout, said it’s sad that the civic administration doesn’t clean the drains. “If drains are cleaned, rain water will flow away easily. Due to poor maintenance by BBMP, we end up suffering,” he said. He added: “Our cars are damaged and the civic body won't give compensation. Where do we go? Regardless of the taxes we pay, we end up paying a price of the civic body’s negligence.” Another resident Nakul A, a software employee whose new SUV was submerged, said the civic body should give compensate for the damage. “The car was parked outside my home in Chandapura near Electronic City. Due to heavy rain, water entered the vehicle and damaged it,” Nakul said. BBMP officials said Madiwala Lake overflowed and that led to water entering the basements of homes and apartments. Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner, BBMP, said heavy rain caused flooding across the city, but it has been noticeably less this year. “The Indian Meteorological Department had predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall with a yellow alert. We need to be prepared for it,” Gupta told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rain-plays-spoilsport-on-festival-day/articleshow/87049079.cms||---
---||India||Modi & Johnson to launch global solar power grid||NEW DELHI: India and the United Kingdom will jointly launch the Green Grids Initiative-One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) — a trans-national grid to transport solar power to different countries — during world leaders’ summit at the beginning of the 26th session of the UN climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK in the first week of November. The initiative, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi three years ago, will be endorsed in the form of a political declaration by the fourth general assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) during October 18-21. Sources said Modi would attend the world leaders’ summit on November 1-2 at COP26 and launch it with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in presence of other heads of state/government. An official confirmation to this effect would be conveyed to the UK soon, they added. US President Joe Biden, Australian PM Scott Morrison and other leaders will also attend the summit during the first half of the COP26 which would see countries finalise rules of carbon market mechanism (Article 6) under the Paris Agreement. The Article 6 rules are the last piece of the Agreement which are yet to be finalised. Implementation of the OSOWOG will revolve around the concept that the ‘Sun Never Sets’ and is, therefore, a constant at some geographical location, globally, at any given point of time. The ISA, which was jointly launched by India and France on the side-lines of the COP21 in Paris in 2015, will be the implementing body of the global grid. The ISA fourth general assembly next week will be an occasion where 80-member countries of this inter-governmental body see how to go about the OSOWOG in a manner which may help the world reach its collective mitigation goal of limiting global warming at 1.5 degree C by 2050 from the pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels. The assembly will deliberate on the strategic plan of the ISA for the next five years. It will cover different issues including strategy for private sector engagement. Besides updates on ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ initiative, the ‘Trillion Dollars Solar Investment Roadmap for 2030’ will also be the focus of the ISA meet. According to the ISA’s concept note on OSOWOG, the global solar grid will be implemented in three phases. In the first phase, the ‘Indian Grid’ will interconnect with West Asia, south Asia, and south-east Asia grids to share solar and other renewable energy resources for meeting electricity needs including during peak demand. It will then be inter-connected with the African power pools in the second phase. The third phase would cover global inter-connection of the power transmission grid to achieve the OSOWOG’s vision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-johnson-to-launch-global-solar-power-grid/articleshow/87053203.cms||Vishwa Mohan

It is in its prime,” principal chief conservator of forests Shekar Kumar Niraj told TOI. But trapping MDT-23 (Mudumalai Division Tiger 23) was no easy task and the operation lasted three weeks. Wounded and pushed out of its territory by young tigers, 13-year-old MDT-23 killed a resident of Muduguli village in the core area of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) on July 19. According to forest department officials, the big cat was then found roaming in private tea estates of Devarshola. It killed an estate worker in Devan I estate on September 24. It also killed four heads of cattle in the area. After an operation was launched to capture it, the tiger left for Singara range in MTR buffer zone, which is 32km away. On October 1, it killed a tribal man in Kurumbarpadi hamlet near Masinagudi. Search operation intensified by involving a special team from Wayanad in Kerala, three sniffer dogs, special task force (STF) members, two kumki elephants and an elite special forest team. The operation continued for 22 days. However, in the past five days, the strength of the teams was reduced to 30, and further to 10 on Thursday. After getting permission from the national tiger conservation authority (NTCA) and conforming to protocols, the tiger was sent to the Mysore Zoo for treatment. Four veterinarians and some forest officials accompanied the animal. “The tiger will be given special facility at the zoo for treatment. Before transportation, intravenous glucose was administered and its pulse was checked,” said Niraj. “The whole procedure was documented and videographed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tamil-nadu-killer-tiger-snoozes-after-21-days-2-darts-will-go-to-mysore-zoo/articleshow/87053271.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

With diesel price breaching the three-digit mark and petrol rate hovering around Rs 110 in Karnataka, the BJP government is under pressure to bring them under Rs 100 a litre. Patil, speaking at an event in Chitradurga, said he would discuss the subsidy plan with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai soon. “Farmers are facing a lot of hardships and providing subsidies will help them a bit,” the minister said. Patil had first mooted the idea -- a 25 per litre subsidy on diesel for farmers who own up to 10 acres of land -- prior to the 2021-22 budget being presented by Yediyurappa. It was envisaged on the lines of the fuel subsidy being provided to fishermen in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-agriculture-department-plans-fuel-subsidy-for-farmers/articleshow/87053204.cms||---
---||World||Authorities call fatal stabbing of UK lawmaker terrorist act||LEIGH-ON-SEA/ ENGLAND: Police say the stabbing of a long-serving member of Parliament during a meeting with constituents was a terrorist incident, and that they believe the attacker acted alone. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement released early Saturday that the early investigation into the slaying of Conservative lawmaker David Amess ``has revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism.'' Amess, 69, was attacked around midday Friday at a Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, a town about 40 miles (62 kilometers) east of London. Paramedics tried without success to save him. Police arrested the suspect and recovered a knife. A long-serving member of Parliament was stabbed to death Friday during a meeting with constituents at a church in England, an attack that united Britain's fractious politicians in shock and sorrow. A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene. Police said that counterterrorism officers were leading the investigation into the slaying of Conservative lawmaker David Amess but that they had not yet determined whether it was a terrorist attack. They did not identify the suspect, who was held on suspicion of murder. ``The investigation is in its very early stages,`` Essex Police Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington said. ``It will be for investigators to determine whether or not this is a terrorist incident.`` The slaying came five years after another MP, Jo Cox, was murdered by a far-right extremist in her small-town constituency, and it renewed concern about the risks politicians run as they go about their work representing voters. British politicians generally are not given police protection when they meet with their constituents. Tributes poured in for Amess from across the political spectrum, as well as from the community he had served for decades. Residents paid tribute to him at a vigil at a church in Leigh-on-Sea. ``He carried that great East London spirit of having no fear and being able to talk to people and the level they're at,'' the Rev. Jeffrey Woolnaugh said at the vigil, attended by about 80 people. ``Not all politicians, I would say, are good at that.'' Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he and his Cabinet were ``deeply shocked and heart-stricken.`` ``David was a man who believed passionately in this country and in its future, and we've lost today a fine public servant and a much-loved friend and colleague,`` Johnson said. The prime minister would not say whether the attack meant politicians needed tighter security, saying, ``We must really leave the police to get on with their investigation.'' Amess, 69, was attacked around midday at a Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, a town about 40 miles (62 kilometers) east of London. Paramedics tried without success to save him. Police arrested the suspect and recovered a knife. Amess had been a member of Parliament for Southend West, which includes Leigh-on-Sea, since 1997, and had been a lawmaker since 1983, making him one of the longest-serving politicians in the House of Commons. A social conservative on the right of his party, he was a well-liked figure with a reputation for working hard for his constituents and campaigning ceaselessly to have Southend declared a city. Amess, who leaves a wife and five children, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 for his service, becoming Sir David. Flags at Parliament were lowered to half-staff amid a profusion of questions about lawmakers' security. ``This is an incident that will send shockwaves across the parliamentary community and the whole country,'' House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said. ``In the coming days we will need to discuss and examine MPs' security and any measures to be taken, but for now, our thoughts and prayers are with David's family, friends and colleagues.'' Violence against British politicians is rare, but concerns have grown about the increasingly bitter polarization of the country's politics. In 2016, a week before the country's divisive Brexit referendum, Cox, a Labour Party lawmaker, was fatally stabbed and shot in northern England. Also, several people have been jailed in recent years for threatening lawmakers. British lawmakers are protected by armed police when they are inside Parliament, and security there was tightened after an attacker inspired by the Islamic State group fatally stabbed a police officer at the gates in 2017. But politicians have no such protection in their constituencies. Amess published the times and locations of his open meetings with constituents on his website. Two other British lawmakers have been attacked over the past two decades during their ``surgeries,'' regular meetings where constituents can present concerns and complaints. Labour legislator Stephen Timms was stabbed in the stomach in 2010 by a student radicalized by online sermons from an al-Qaida-linked preacher. In 2000, Liberal Democrat Nigel Jones and his aide Andrew Pennington were attacked by a man wielding a sword during such a meeting. Pennington was killed and Jones wounded in the attack in Cheltenham, England. Former Prime Minister Theresa May, a Conservative, tweeted that Amess' killing was a ``tragic day for our democracy,'' and former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was ``shocked and horrified.'' Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party said on Twitter: ``In a democracy, politicians must be accessible and open to scrutiny, but no one deserves to have their life taken while working for and representing their constituents.'' Kim Leadbeater, Jo Cox's sister and now a member of Parliament herself, said it was ``horrific'' that Amess' family was experiencing what hers had gone through. ``They will think about this every single day for the rest of their lives,'' she said. ``I find myself now working as a politician and trying to do good things for people, and it's really important you get good people in public life, but this is the risk we are all taking, and so many MPs will be scared by this.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/authorities-call-fatal-stabbing-of-uk-lawmaker-terrorist-act/articleshow/87053272.cms||---
---||World||IS claims deadly suicide attack on Shiite mosque in Afghanistan's Kandahar||KANDAHAR/ AFGHANISTAN: The Islamic State group on Saturday claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack on a Shiite mosque in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar that killed at least 41 people and injured scores more. The Friday assault came just a week after another IS-claimed attack on Shiite worshippers at a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz that killed more than 60 people. In a statement released on its Telegram channels, the jihadist group said two Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) suicide bombers carried out separate attacks on different parts of the mosque in Kandahar-- the spiritual heartland of the Taliban -- while worshippers prayed inside. The group, a bitter rival of fellow Sunni Islamist movement the Taliban, which swept back to power in Afghanistan in August as the United States and its allies withdrew, regards Shiite Muslims as heretics. UK-based conflict analysis firm ExTrac said Friday's assault was the first by IS-K in Kandahar, and the fourth mass casualty massacre since the Taliban took Kabul. ExTrac researcher Abdul Sayed told AFP the attack was "challenging the Taliban claims of holding control on the country. If the Taliban can't protect Kandahar from an IS-K attack, how could it protect the rest of the country?" Inside the mosque, after the blast, the walls were pockmarked with shrapnel and volunteers swept up debris in the ornately painted prayer hall. Rubble lay in an entrance corridor. In the wake of the explosions, Kandahar police chief Maulvi Mehmood said "a brutal attack has been witnessed on a Shiite mosque as a result of which a huge number of our countrymen have lost their lives". In a video statement, Mehmood said security for the mosque had been provided by guards from the Shiite community but that henceforth the Taliban would take charge of its protection. Hafiz Abdulhai Abbas, director of health for Kandahar, told AFP 41 people had been killed about 70 wounded, according to hospital information. At least 15 ambulances were seen rushing to and from the scene, as Taliban security cordoned off the area. "We are overwhelmed," a doctor at the city's central Mirwais hospital told AFP. "There are too many dead bodies and wounded people brought to our hospital. We are expecting more to come. We are in urgent need of blood. We have asked all the local media in Kandahar to ask people to come and donate blood." Eyewitnesses spoke of gunfire alongside the explosions, and a security guard assigned to protect the mosque said three of his comrades had been shot as the bombers fought their way in. Sayed Rohullah told AFP: "It was the Friday prayer time, and when we were preparing I heard shots. Two people had entered the mosque. "They had opened fire on the guards and in response the guards had also opened fire on them. One of them committed a suicide blast inside the mosque." Other bombs were detonated in crowded areas outside the main building, he and other witnesses said. "We are saddened to learn that an explosion took place in a mosque of the Shiite brotherhood in the first district of Kandahar city in which a number of our compatriots were martyred and wounded," tweeted Taliban interior ministry spokesman Qari Sayed Khosti. The US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington condemned the attack and reiterated a call for the "Taliban to live up to the commitment it has made to counterterrorism, and specifically to taking on the shared threat we face from ISIS-K". "We are determined to see to it that no group... can ever again use Afghan soil as a launching pad for attacks on the United States or other countries." The UN mission in Afghanistan in a tweet also condemned the "latest atrocity targeting a religious institution and worshippers". "Those responsible need to be held to account." The Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan after overthrowing the US-backed government, has its own history of persecuting Shiites. But the new Taliban-led administration has vowed to stabilize the country, and in the wake of the Kunduz attack promised to protect the Shiite minority now living under its rule. Shiites are estimated to make up roughly 10 percent of the Afghan population. Many of them are Hazara, an ethnic group that has been persecuted in Afghanistan for decades. In October 2017, an IS suicide attacker struck a Shiite mosque in the west of Kabul, killing 56 people and wounding 55.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/is-claims-deadly-suicide-attack-on-shiite-mosque-in-afghanistans-kandahar/articleshow/87053309.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Bodies of 2 workers killed in LPG accident pulled out after 11 hours||UJJAIN: Clad in protective gear and masks, and breathing oxygen through 60mlong flame-proof ducts, NDRF personnel on Friday retrieved the bodies of the two labourers who had fallen into an LPG collection tank at Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s Nazarpur plant 11 hours earlier. The team daren’t even use torches or oxygen cylinders to enter the ‘bullet’ tank, for fear of the inflammable gas, and had to improvise on the go. The bodies were brought out around 3.40am, Ujjain collector Asheesh Singh told TOI. The IOCL bottling plant is situated in Ghatia and was erroneously reported to be operated by Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL). The contractual labourers – Lakhan Singh, 30 and Rajendra Singh, 27 – had fallen into the degassed tank around 4.30pm on Thursday. Eyewitnesses have told local officials that the accident happened during maintenance work at the 150-tonne bullet tank. Its contents were to be flushed out using high-pressure water. One of the labourers peeped through a 21-inch opening to check the flow of water, but slipped into it and fell unconscious due to the escaping gases, industrial health and safety assistant director Himanshu Solomon said. The second labourer went to check on him and also fell in. The other workers shut off water supply and raised the alarm. Rescuers had a daunting task due to LPG. Regular lights or metal equipment could not be used as any spark might have caused an explosion. “A special flameproof compressor and blower was procured from Grasim Industries’ chemical division, and the bullet was cleared of water and residue gases,” Solomon said, adding that a flame-proof system that supplies oxygen at a distance of 60 metres was summoned from Grasim. An NDRF team arrived from Bhopal around 2am, and one of its officers volunteered to enter the tank. He first hauled Lakhan’s body up the stairs around 3.40pm. Fifteen minutes later, Rajendra’s body was brought out. “We did not use ropes or chains, fearing that any friction could cause sparks. The bodies had to be manually lifted up the stairs,” Solomon said. The recovery of the bodies calmed the villagers who had gathered at the plant and staged protests, blocking the Indore-Kota highway. The bodies have been sent for autopsy. Collector Singh has ordered a magisterial probe into the incident, and to see if safety precautions were followed at the plant. IOCL Nazarpur plant DGM Subhash Ramtake said the families of the deceased will be given a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each, plus Rs 1 lakh each for the funerals. In view of the financial condition of the families, they will be given an additional Rs 1 lakh, and a member from each family will be given a job as a contractual worker. An IOCL statement said the company’s emergency procedures were immediately activated and industrial safety and occupational health personnel went to the scene to carry out the rescue work. In compliance with company protocol, an investigation has been initiated to determine the cause of the accident, it said. “We are offering our condolences and support to the aggrieved families,” said executive director V Satishkumar, who heads the state unit, adding that relief has been provided to their families. The plant will resume operation on Saturday, and supply of LPG cylinders will not be affected, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-bodies-of-2-workers-killed-in-lpg-accident-pulled-out-after-11-hours/articleshow/87053334.cms||---

The three blasted off shortly after midnight (1600 GMT) from the Jiuquan launch centre in northwestern China's Gobi desert, state-run news agency Xinhua said, with the team expected to spend six months at the Tiangong space station. After the launch, the China Manned Space Agency declared it a success and said the crew members "were in good shape", according to Xinhua. The Shenzhou-13 vessel carrying the three then docked hours later with the radial port of the space station, Xinhua said in a brief dispatch on Saturday morning. The mission -- twice as long as its 90-day predecessor -- will set up equipment and test technology for future construction on the Tiangong station. Mission commander Zhai Zhigang, 55, a former fighter pilot who performed the country's first spacewalk in 2008, said the team would undertake "more complex" spacewalks than during previous missions. The astronaut team includes military pilot Wang Yaping, 41, who is the first woman to visit the space station after becoming China's second woman in space in 2013. The other team member is People's Liberation Army pilot Ye Guangfu, 41. A previous record-breaking space crew -- making the first mission to Tiangong -- returned to Earth in September after three months on the space station. China's heavily promoted space programme has already seen the nation land a rover on Mars and send probes to the moon. Tiangong, meaning "heavenly palace", is expected to operate for at least 10 years. Its core module entered orbit earlier this year, with the station expected to be operational by 2022. The completed station will be similar to the Soviet Mir station that orbited Earth from the 1980s until 2001. The long mission is set to "expand China's technological boundary" and verify the space station system's capacity for a longer duration of human occupation, Chen Lan, an independent space analyst at GoTaikonauts, told AFP. "I don't think it is very challenging, as China's technologies (are) quite mature, though anything in space is always challenging," Chen said. Saturday's blast-off came shortly after China launched its first solar exploration satellite into space, equipped with a telescope to observe changes in the Sun. The Chinese space agency is planning a total of 11 missions to Tiangong through to the end of next year, including at least two more crewed launches that will deliver two lab modules to expand the 70-tonne station. China's space ambitions have been fuelled in part by a US ban on its astronauts on the International Space Station, a collaboration among the United States, Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan. The ISS is due for retirement after 2024, although NASA has said it could potentially remain functional beyond 2028. Chinese space authorities have said they are open to foreign collaboration on the space station, although the scope of that cooperation is as yet unclear. The country has come a long way since launching its first satellite in 1970. It put the first Chinese "taikonaut" in space in 2003 and landed the Chang'e-4 robot on the far side of the Moon in 2019 -- a historic first. China in May became the second nation to land and operate a rover on Mars. Astronauts on the Tiangong space station will have separate living spaces, exercise equipment and a communication centre for emails and video calls with ground control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinese-astronauts-arrive-at-space-station-for-longest-mission/articleshow/87053378.cms||---

Meanwhile, AICC incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat said Sidhu had assured Rahul that he was withdrawing his resignation and resuming his work as PCC president. Sidhu tweeted after the meeting, “I have shared my concerns with Rahul Gandhi Ji, was assured they will be sorted out.” However, when asked by the media if he will continue as the PPCC chief and his resignation has been accepted, Sidhu folded his hands and said, “Whatever I am doing is in front of you.” Meanwhile, Rawat said, “He (Sidhu) shared his concerns with Rahul Gandhi. We have told him that his concerns will be taken care of here. He assured Rahul Gandhi that he has withdrawn his resignation and he will resume his duties as the PCC president.” However, Sidhu is yet to categorically announce that he is withdrawing his resignation. He quit as the PPCC chief on September 28. There has been suspense over the resignation as it had come as a major embarrassment for the party high command. On Wednesday, Sidhu had said in a video that he was not willing to make a compromise. After the meeting with Rawat and party general secretary K C Venugopal on Thursday, Sidhu had stayed back at Punjab Bhawan in Delhi and went to meet Rahul at 8.10 pm on Friday at the latter’s residence. There had been reports that Sidhu was not happy with the recent appointments made by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, including the new DGP and advocate general. Sidhu had said on Thursday that he has full faith in the leadership of party chief Sonia Gandhi and any decision taken by her would be acceptable to him. However, he had not said anything about the status of his resignation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-assured-that-my-concerns-will-be-sorted-out-says-navjot-singh-sidhu/articleshow/87053347.cms||---

He praised Mumbai police for seizing drugs of Rs 150 crore, “while they (NCB) made a big thing about sniffing a few grams and taking photos with celebrities who were caught”. Thackeray, who heads a three-party alliance which has central investigating agencies such as ED and I-T breathing down its neck, said that under the Constitution, states and the Centre enjoy equal powers and states don’t have to genuflect before the Centre. He alleged that the BJP-led Centre was trying to destabilise Maharashtra by resorting to I-T raids to ‘fix’ the state’s leaders. Demanding an end to “interference” by the central government in day-to-day functioning, Thackeray called for an open debate on the federal structure to sharply define Centre-state ties within the broad framework of the Constitution. In a broadside intended to burnish his own saffron credentials, Thackeray said Hindutva was not under threat from anyone else but from neo-Hindus who were exploiting the term to come to power. “They are now adopting the British policy of divide and rule to remain in power.” Seeking to draw a distinction between the RSS worldview and the politics practised by BJP, Thackeray stressed that he was not criticising RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. He said Sena’s Hindutva and that of RSS was identical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-trying-to-defame-maharashtra-with-drug-hauls-celeb-arrests-uddhav/articleshow/87053414.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Licence process for retail cracker sale goes online||Bhopal: District administration has started online process for giving licence to retail cracker sellers ahead of Diwali. Onan-average 500 licences are issued for retail sale of crackers for a month ahead of Diwali. Earlier, the process was offline but now, licences will be given online with the applicant not requiring to making rounds of any office. The number of vendors last year, when Diwali was celebrated under the shadow of Covid-19, appeared to be less and sale was also affected, but with the festive spirit returning among people of late as seen during Durga Utsav and Dussehra, sale of crackers is likely to pick up again. And, also the number of vendors seeking to renew their licences or seeking a fresh one. Additional collector Dileep Yadav said that the licences are renewed for vendors every year and till the previous year, the process for the same was offline but this year, the district administration has started an online process. He said that applications are already being accepted on the portal and once desired scrutiny is done including the police record of the applicant, licences will be issued and the vendor getting would be able to generate a certificate online. On the guidelines for sale of crackers and fireworks on Diwali, he said that the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court and the NGT for the purpose would be followed. But, before the district administration issues guidelines, a communique from the home department based on the NGT guidelines on whether residents of a particular city would be allowed to indulge in fireworks during Diwali or not. The decision is taken based on the prevalent air quality of the city. Since, air quality in Bhopal was "moderate" ahead of Diwali last year, fireworks were allowed in the city. This year also, the situation is likely to be the same. The state home department issues guidelines for the districts mainly based on supreme court guidelines, Yadav said. During Diwali last year, the Corona situation was bad. Onan-average, more than 200 cases were being detected in the district every day on samples in the range of 2,000 to 2,500, indicating a nearly10% infection rate. The situation is far better this year with 4 to 6 cases being detected daily on a sample size of 5,500 to 6,000. With the 100% population of the district having received at least the first dose of vaccine, people are far more confident and festive spirit is back among the people. In the changed situation, M P Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) may not issue an appeal to people to abstain from fireworks in the interest of Corona patients quarantined at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-licence-process-for-retail-cracker-sale-goes-online/articleshow/87053426.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Watch ports, drugs coming in from Delhi: Punjab deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa||JALANDHAR: Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who has the home department, said that most drug consignments in Punjab are coming from Delhi and huge quantities are reaching the country through ports. Speaking to TOI on Friday, Randhawa also reminded former CM Amarinder Singh that he had alleged BSF and Pakistan Rangers nexus in 2016 but was now justifying increased jurisdiction of BSF in Punjab. “Only small quantities are being pushed in from the international border, and for that too BSF needs to keep its uncompromised vigil across a limited width of a 100-200 meters. If drugs or any weapons can cross that limited width which is supposed to remain under strict vigil then only BSF is responsible. If they can’t guard that width properly, which is their key job, why should they have jurisdiction in 50km deep inside border?” he said. The deputy CM said his enquiries from police officials revealed that in most cases of recoveries, peddlers have been found bringing heroin from Delhi and there have even been instances of consignments coming from Jammu. “Most drug consignments are coming to Punjab from the opposite direction, that is from Delhi, and not from international border. Whatever quantity is coming from international border or weapons are being pushed for that only BSF is responsible and accountable for any laxity. In such a scenario there is no logic in increasing its jurisdiction,” he said. “Major quantities are coming though ports and consumption of drugs has increased across the country. The Union government should be more worried about ports. Biggest seizure so far of around 3,000 kg heroin has been from a Gujarat port but they are pushing the narrative of Punjab border. Such huge seizure shows the level of consumption going up across the country,” he argued. Over the last few years, the Punjab Police has arrested foreign nationals, including women, also which were involved in bringing drugs from Delhi. In first week of July last, a joint operation by Punjab and Delhi police had led to seizure of 17 kg heroin from a farmhouse in Sainik Farm, Delhi, and arrest of four Afghan nationals. On August 31 last, Kapurthala police seized 20 kg heroin being brought from Jammu. Randhawa also pointed to the contrast in former chief minister Amarinder Singh’s stand in 2016, when he alleged BSF-Pak Rangers nexus, and his current take on increased jurisdiction of BSF. “During his tenure (as CM), he (Amarinder) always defended the Punjab Police and now suddenly he is becoming fond of BSF. He should explain the contrast in his position,” he said. Capt Amarinder Singh on BSF-Pak Rangers nexus in 2016Addressing at a public event in Amritsar in March 2016, Capt Amarinder Singh had alleged a nexus between BSF and Pakistan Rangers to facilitate drug smuggling. At an event attended by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Amarinder is heard saying, “When I was the chief minister, I met then home minister L K Advani and told him about the nexus between BSF and Pak Rangers. I suggested that to break that nexus, BSF platoons be replaced every year, instead of two years, so that a platoon is shifted before nexus develops. He said ‘it would be very expensive’ but I said it would not be more expensive than the lives of people of Punjab... A few days back, did you not see a professionally built underground tunnel? Is it possible without the nexus between Rangers and BSF?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/watch-ports-drugs-coming-in-from-delhi-punjab-deputy-cm-sukhjinder-singh-randhawa/articleshow/87053310.cms||IP Singh

---||India||From Rajasthan to Mumbai via Delhi, a dash for hand transplant||MUMBAI: After a phone call on Thursday, a 22-year-old from Ajmer was rushed out of home around 11pm to travel over 400 km by road to Delhi in order to board a flight to Mumbai around 5.20am. The young man, who lost his hands and legs after getting electrocuted in his farm early last year, had strong motivation for the lastminute flight to Mumbai: to receive a pair of hands. His hand transplant — the third in Mumbai— started at Global Hospital, Parel, around 8pm on Friday. Like the would-be recipient, the hands were flown into Mumbai after due procedure from Ahmedabad Civil Hospital. From the airport to the hospital, the hands took only 16 minutes to arrive because of a green corridor imposed by the police. The donor, a 50-year-old who had undergone brain surgery, was declared brain dead late on Thursday, and a message about the availability of his hands, lungs and heart was flashed on a WhatsApp group maintained by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) to all hospitals certified to carry out transplants. A transplant network with NOTTO and its regional (ROTTO) and state avatars (SOTTO) has made interstate transplants easier. “Inter-state transplants have become organized in recent times. There is now a structure and deadlines for hospitals to respond to messages and every procedure is streamlined. Hospitals get alerts about the availability of donors in any part of the country in real time,” said Dr Akash Shukla of ROTTO. For the 22-year-old, the overnight journey wasn’t a guarantee to get hands, but just the start of the process. A couple of months ago, he had received an alert to be ready for a transplant, but the hands were allocated to another hospital. On Friday, he reached Global Hospital around 7.30am to first submit blood samples for an important test called crossmatching. A crossmatch is done between the to-be donor and to-be recipient’s blood to rule out any antibodies and ensure compatibility. At the same time he was travelling to Mumbai, an official from Global Hospital’s Ahmedabad clinic travelled with a sample of the tobe donor’s blood. The crossmatch testing started around 10am and the results were out around 2pm, signalling that the transplant could be done. A team of doctors from Global also had to go to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital to retrieve the hands and travel back. Before the city’s third transplant started on Friday, plastic surgeon Dr Nilesh Satbhai said the recipient got registered at Global Hospital in August. Global Hospital performed the city’s first hand transplant on August 28, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-rajasthan-to-mumbai-via-delhi-a-dash-for-hand-transplant/articleshow/87053482.cms||---

More than 200 palanquins of deities, along with thousands of followers are taking part in the festival. The Dussehra committee had sent invitations to 332 deities through SDMs and tehsildars. The deities first paid their obeisance to Lord Raghunath, presiding deity of the festivity and performed the important rituals, besides taking part in the rath yatra. A huge crowd of devotees, including tourists, thronged Kullu to witness this centuries old cultural and religious festival. The festivities start from royal palace of Kullu, where the royal family dressed in traditional attire performs the rituals and idol of Lord Raghunath is brought to Rath ground for yatra. Although, commercial activities are not allowed in Dussehra this year, thousands of people thronged Dhalpur Dussehra ground to witness “dev maha-kumbh”. To prevent Covid-19 from spreading, Kullu administration has adopted some strict steps. Be it priest, kardar or followers of the deities, everyone bhas been asked to get final vaccination done before entering Dussehra ground. Visitors from other states are also not being allowed, unless they produce final vaccination certificate or a negative RT-PCR report. The entire Kullu valley will be echoing with the divine music of drums and trumpets for seven days and all the deities will camp here till October 21. Last year, the Rath Yatra had presence of only eight deities due to pandemic. On Friday, the police were struggling to manage the crowd. As per tradition, palanquins of Hidimba Devi and Bijli Mahadev scattered the crowd and made way for chariot. The chariot was pulled from Rath ground to lower ground where it will rest for six days. On seventh day, the chariot will be wheeled to bank of Beas river to perform final rituals and then will be brought back to Rath ground. Unlike other parts of the country, effigies are not burnt in Kullu Dussehra. It is marked in Kullu by gathering of deities, their prayers, processions and religious ceremonies. Thousands of tourists and research scholars from across the world also throng Kullu to witness unique blend of culture, tradition, religion and folk art. However, very fewer tourists were seen this year. Thousands of traders from many states also used to do brisk business here for a month till Diwali, but this year commercial activities are not allowed to avoid crowding of Dussehra ground. Also, international folk dance competitions and other programmes will not be held. Himachal Pradesh governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar inaugurated the Dussehra festivity by lighting the diyas. Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg said, “Nakas have been laid on all entry points to the Dussehra ground to ensure people have received both the doses or they are carrying a negative RTPCR report. Three Covid-19 vaccination kiosks have been set up by health department at the venue.” According to historians, the idol of Lord Raghunath was brought to Kullu from Ayodhya in 1651 when Raja Jagat Singh was the ruler of Kullu state. Dussehra celebrations in Kullu started after 1660 when the Raja invited all deities before Lord Raghunath. The people here are still following the same custom. Kullu Dussehra was declared an international festival in 1972.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/himachal-pradesh-weeklong-kullu-dussehra-begins-with-rath-yatra/articleshow/87053405.cms||Suresh Sharma

Heavilyarmed officials, who claimed to be from a special unit of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, forcibly entered and vandalised Gurdwara Dashmesh Pita at Karte Parwan, Kabul, according to a report from Kabul. “They intimidated the community present there, and abused the sanctity of the holy place,” said Puneet Singh Chandhok said, president of Indian World Forum, according to news agency ANI. According to Chandhok, the Taliban soldiers also razed the home of a former Sikh MP. “They’re not only raiding the gurdwara but also the entire premises of community school attached next to it. The private security guards of the gurdwara initially prevented them from entering but they were also threatened and also manhandled,” he added. While there was no official response from India, sources said the government was trying to verify the reports. Following the vandalisation of a gurdwara in Kabul last week, the government had said such attacks raised concerns not just for India but for the world and that the international community must continue to insist on fulfilling goals outlined in the August 30 UN Security Council resolution that was adopted under India’s presidency. The UNSC 2593 resolution reaffirmed the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities, and encouraged all parties to seek an inclusive, negotiated political settlement. It also called upon the Taliban to ensure that the Afghan soil is not used by terrorist groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/armed-taliban-fighters-vandalise-kabul-gurdwara-again-reports/articleshow/87053503.cms||---

Prominent temples in Chennai attracted a modest crowd. Thousands of parents along with their children arrived at temples in Mahalingapuram, Anna Nagar and MRC Nagar in Chennai early in the morning to take part in the Vidyarambham, a traditional ceremony of introducing young children to the learning world on Vijayadasami day. The Tamil Nadu government had on Thursday announced that public worship would be permitted on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. At Kapaleeswarar Temple, Mylapore, and Vadapalani Murugan Temple, the footfall was slightly higher in the evening. There was, however, no traffic congestion as anticipated since many have left to their native places to celebrate puja holidays with their families. Minister of Hindu religious and charitable endowments department P K Sekar Babu told reporters in Vadapalani that arrangements had been made in all temples to follow social distancing norms among devotees. He said reopening temples had nothing to do with BJP’s protests as the decision was made keeping in mind people's wishes. Across the state, the footfall was low in the morning but many temples saw larger crowds in the evening and Covid-19 norms went for a toss in many temples. Queues at the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai were short in the morning. As the government’s decision was announced on Thursday, many were not aware of the government decision. “It came as a surprise, and I took the first bus available and came to the Meenakshi temple,’’ said Packialakshmi from Melur, who had wanted to get her daughter’s wedding invitation blessed at the temple. At the Sri Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram, which is a destination for pilgrims during long weekends like this one, footfalls were low. In Trichy and the other districts in the central region, the footfall was low on Friday. At temples including those in Srirangam, Thiruvanaikoil and Rockfort, the turnout was moderate. Devotees are expected to pour in over the weekend. Parents of children, getting admitted to schools, were happy with the reopening of temples. The Sidhapudhur Ayyappan temple in Coimbatore saw a large number of people bringing their children for the Vidhyarambam. Meanwhile, the temple employees say enforcing Covid norms during the Sabarimala season could prove to be a huge challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/temples-across-tamil-nadu-open-on-fridays-after-five-months-to-moderate-crowd/articleshow/87053489.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Larger ITAT bench to rule on pharma freebies||MUMBAI: A two-member bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in Mumbai has directed that a larger bench should decide whether the expenses on freebies to doctors incurred by pharma companies should be allowed as a business deduction. The fallout of any disallowance of expenditure is that the taxable income goes up, resulting in a higher tax outgo. The bench comprising judicial member Saktijit Dey and vice president Pramod Kumar, in its order dated October 14, said it could not find fault with the action of the I-T officer who, during assessment, had denied a significant sum of expenditure incurred towards freebies to doctors in the hands of Macleods Pharmaceuticals. Tax tribunal cites PM’s allusion to ‘unholy nexus’However, owing to contrary views taken by the co-ordinate bench on the same issue in other cases, and to prevent judicial inconsistency, they recommended that this vexed issue be heard by a larger bench. Typically, pharma companies, large or small, do incur marketing expenses, a significant portion of which constitutes ‘freebies’ to doctors. Typically, it includes foreign trips and hotel stays for doctors (ostensibly to attend a conference), corporate gifts, or subscription to expensive medical journals. In this case heard by the ITAT bench, the officer denied a sum of Rs 111.11 crore for financial year 2010-11 and Rs 137.62 crore in the subsequent year, in the hands of Macleods Pharmaceuticals—these were expenses incurred on freebies to doctors. The cumulative sum disallowed aggregated to Rs 248.74 crore. As the Commissioner (Appeals) had decided in favour of the pharma company, the I-T department filed an appeal with the tax tribunal. The tribunal members hearing the matter, drew reference to a statement by PM Narendra Modi, who had subtly hinted at the unholy nexus between doctors and pharma companies. The PM had said: “…The person who writes the medicine also gets something. You must know that the doctors’ conference is sometimes in Singapore, sometimes it is in Dubai. It is not because someone is sick there; it is so because it is necessary for the pharmaceutical companies.” The ITAT bench observed that the freebies come with strings attached. They cannot be lawfully accepted by medical professionals under the Medical Council Act. Therefore, an expenditure on such freebies is for a purpose prohibited by law. An explanation to Section 37(1) of the I-T Act denies claim of any such expense if the same has been incurred for a purpose which is either an offence or prohibited by law. This explanation was inserted by the Finance Act, 1998 with retrospective effect from April 1, 1962. Thus, the stand of the I-T officer cannot be faulted, the order stated. A circular issued in 2012 by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), provides that any expenses incurred by a pharma company in providing ‘freebies’ to doctors in violation of the regulations issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) will be disallowed in the hands of the company. However, the ITAT bench noted the differing decisions on this issue by the coordinate benches. For instance, in 2017, in the case of PHL Pharma, the ITAT held that disallowance of business expenditure in the hands of the pharma company could not be sustained as the Medical Council guidelines bind only the medical professionals and not the pharma companies. On the other hand, in 2016, in the case of Liva Healthcare, the tax tribunal had held that the CBDT circular is merely a clarification and the bar on illegal payments always existed owing to the explanation to section 37 (1). Now it is over to a larger bench to decide and lend a degree of finality to the vexed issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-larger-itat-bench-to-rule-on-pharma-freebies/articleshow/87053473.cms||Lubna Kably
---||World||Protests in Bangladesh amid communal tensions||DHAKA: Thousands of protesters in Bangladesh’s capital on Friday clashed with police as security forces used tear gas and batons against demonstrators over an image that they perceived as blasphemous and which had gone viral over social media. The image triggered incidents of vandalism at Hindu temples across other parts of the Muslim-majority country. The rise in communal tensions came as the minority Hindus celebrated the last day of their largest religious festival — the Durga Puja. Police said the street protests began after the main Friday prayers at the Baitul Mukarram mosque in the centre of Dhaka. Sajjad Hossain, a deputy commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said several people were injured after the police charged with batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd, which was attempting to break through a police barricade. “They started pelting stones at us, they attacked us,” Hossain said. At least three protesters were detained for questioning, he said. Protesters chanted anti-India slogans and criticized Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, accusing her of being close with New Delhi. Bangladeshi authorities have ordered an investigation into the blasphemous image, while Hasina has warned against any attempts to disturb communal harmony. But Hindu organisations said the attacks continued in other parts of the country where dozens of Hindus were injured and their temple statues vandalised or toppled. Since Wednesday, at least 100 people had been arrested across the country in connection with attacks on Hindu temples, authorities said. Around 9% of Bangladesh’s over 160 million people are Hindu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/protests-in-bangladesh-amid-communal-tensions/articleshow/87053520.cms||---

The leaders of the SPD, who came first in last month polls, the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats said exploratory talks had been constructive and allowed them to establish a road map for more formal negotiations. Party committees are expected to vote over the weekend on whether to do so, bringing them closer to forming a “traffic light” alliance after their respective red, yellow and green colours — the first of its kind at federal level. The Greens and FDP have kept open the option of turning to the conservatives, who have been in office for the last 16 years, should talks with the SPD stumble. The conservatives criticised the road map as contradictory and short on detail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/spds-olaf-scholz-moves-closer-to-succeed-merkel/articleshow/87053559.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Gurgaon chokes on dust from its own infra sites||Gurgaon: The pollution control board in Haryana recently announced a dust portal that will get live data from sensors that are to be installed to monitor construction sites. One doesn’t, however, need sensors to see what’s wrong — non-compliance with dust mitigating measures is evident from a visit to the sites, both of private and government projects. Most construction and infrastructural projects in Gurgaon don’t follow basic guidelines of the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, including shuttering the construction area with green sheets, sprinkling water and covering vehicles carrying construction and demolition (C&D) waste. As a result, their immediate vicinity has turned into dust bowls. For large projects like the Sohna elevated road and the Dwarka Expressway, the affected area too is much larger. A permanent haze shrouds the city’s new sectors, which have the most construction sites. The graded response action plan (GRAP) was supposed to come into effect on Friday, but hasn’t been imposed so far as the government hasn’t received any directions from the Commission for Air Quality Management. For the past couple of weeks, the city claimed to have put in pre-GRAP measures, but these glaring violations continue. As a result, Gurgaon’s air quality index (AQI), which is currently ‘moderate’, is likely to slip into the ‘poor’ category soon. A visit by TOI to other major construction sites in the city as well on Friday, including Atul Kataria Chowk, Huda City Centre and Mahavir Chowk, revealed a similar picture. Everything was covered with a fine layer of dust — the buildings, the trees, the vehicles, and even the workers. None of the workers were seen wearing a dust mask. On Friday, the AQI was recorded at 195 (moderate), a spike compared to the previous day, when the AQI stood at 172. At three of the city’s four air monitoring stations, air quality hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ levels. While the AQI was 195 at Teri Gram and 164 at Gwalpahari (both moderate), it stood at 226 at Sector 51 (poor). The AQI was not monitored at Vikas Sadan because of insufficient data. In new sectors of Gurgaon, where a majority of buildings are still under construction, some residents claimed that they have never seen a clear skyline due to the pervading dust haze. Though there are numerous hoardings along the roads that promise “peaceful living”, “a luxurious life” and “green surroundings” in highrises with all amenities, the reality is the opposite, they said. “We have all been covered in dust for more than two years now because of the Sohna elevated road project. No one cares about the health of residents. The civic authorities are only worried about the completion of the project, they hardly bother about anti-pollution norms,” said Kanwar Pal, a resident of Sohna road. “Construction activities are going on at night in residential areas, which is also a violation of the norms. The sites don’t have any covers to stop dust from dispersing,” said Mona Singh, a resident of Sector 89. Under GRAP, strict vigilance by the civic authorities is required, as well as no tolerance for visible emissions, which should prevent plying of visibly polluting vehicles by impounding or heavy fines. The authorities should also enforce rules for dust control at construction sites and shut down those that are non-compliant. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) should periodically review compliance of the dust mitigation measures at C&D sites. Though the norms are very clear, most of the sites that TOI visited were found transporting construction material in trucks without adequate covering. The truck wheels were not washed, thus carrying dust outside of the premises. C&D waste was seen dumped along the roadsides and grinding of stones was being carried out in the open. The authorities, meanwhile, claimed they are taking measures to mitigate air pollution. “We have been sprinkling water on roads where construction activities are being carried out. As it was noticed that dust was covering Mahavir Chowk, a team was sent to sprinkle water along the stretch,” said Subhash Yadav, nodal officer of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon’s environment and sustainability wing. “We are keeping a close watch on construction sites to mitigate air pollution. Our teams are taking the required action,” HSPCB regional officer (Gurgaon) Sandeep Singh said. Asked when GRAP would be imposed in the city, HSPCB secretary S Narayana said: “We will have a meeting on Monday with CAQM again to finalise the actions and directions on GRAP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-chokes-on-dust-from-its-own-infra-sites/articleshow/87050913.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Business||Top 4 IT companies recruit record 1 lakh employees in April-September||BENGALURU: India’s four biggest IT firms — TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL — have seen their combined employee strength rise by over 1 lakh in the first six months of the fiscal year. That’s 13 times more than in the corresponding period of the previous year, after the pandemic had struck. And it’s almost twice that in the corresponding period of the pre-pandemic year, 2019-20. It’s an indication of how much demand has picked up in IT services. Enterprises around the world are trying to digitalise their operations with the pandemic underscoring how important that is for sustainability. There’s a big movement to cloud because of its ability to scale IT requirements up and down very quickly. That movement to cloud is also opening up new opportunities in analytics, artificial intelligence, and in internet of things. Digitalisation has also proved a fertile ground for cyber criminals, and that has, in turn, led to massive demand for cyber security. TCS, which has 5.2 lakh employees, led the hiring momentum (see graphic). Some of the hiring by companies is to deal with high attrition rates. Infosys’s attrition last quarter rose to 20.1%, from just 13.9% in the June quarter. Other companies have also seen attrition rates soar. TCS has said it plans to make offers to 75,000 freshers this year, a record for the company. In an interview to TOI, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said, “The conviction in technology and the momentum in this is increasing.” He pointed out how the cloud-based transformation represents an architecture change in IT. Cloud, he said, is also enabling capex to be replaced by opex, allowing enterprises to do a lot more experiments. On the hiring momentum, Gopinathan said the last time TCS saw this was in 2011-12, coming out of the financial crisis. Infosys last week raised its revenue guidance for the year for the second time, an indication of how quickly demand is picking up. The company has increased its fresher hiring target for this year to 45,000, from 35,000 that it had planned three months ago. Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said the demand environment is very strong “and the pipeline, which is the highest in recent quarters, is a reflection of that”. HCL Technologies CEO C Vijayakumar said, “We witnessed the highest net hiring numbers in the last quarter — 11,153. Net hiring over the last three quarters has been at about 28,000 in our employee workforce and there’s another 3,500-odd in terms of third-party contractors. So, the total is pretty much near 32,000 over the last three quarters itself,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/top-4-it-companies-recruit-record-1-lakh-employees-in-april-september/articleshow/87053662.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Gurgaon||Slogans, bhajans again as group opposes namaz in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: For the second straight week, a group of people, including locals, protested against Friday prayers in the open in Sector 47 with placards, slogans like ‘Namaz ki jagah khaali karo’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ and bhajan recitals.  Police were again forced to shift the congregation about 100 metres away. While the prayers passed off peacefully, they were carried out in a charged atmosphere and amid heavy police deployment. In a near replay of last week’s incident, a large group of 100-odd people gathered at the ground opposite the State Vigilance Bureau office, where namaz is performed every week, around 1pm, when members of the Muslim community had assembled for prayers. This time too, the protesters brought mikes and loudspeakers with them and sang bhajans. One of the placards read ‘stop namaz in open places’. To stop the crowd from approaching the namaz site, police put up a barricade. Some residents alleged that those praying at the namaz site are coming from far-flung sectors, like sectors 7 and 8, to “create trouble”. “Police should check their ID cards. They are outsiders, they have options in their own area too, where they can go to pray. We have no problem with them offering namaz. We are ready to open our community centre to them for the purpose. But, they are here to encroach the land,” claimed Sector 45 RWA president Anil Yadav. “We want the vacant plot to be turned into a market for the public’s convenience,” a woman who was among the protesters said. Members of the Muslim community termed the protests an attempt by some “to gain political mileage”. “Not all of the people who are protesting are residents. Political people are mixed up too. You cannot use religion as a tool to obstruct another community’s prayers,” said Altaf Ahmed, co-founder, Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch. Alleging continued “harassment” of the community, Ahmed added that some people were trying to “instil fear amongst us”.  He also hinted that given the situation and the past few incidents, there could be an attempt to “instigate violence” at the site next week. “The demand for IDs to be checked is unconstitutional and allegations that we are responsible for thefts and crime are uncalled for,” a person who was part of the Friday prayers said on the condition of anonymity. Police said meetings, which include members from both sides, have been held with the SDM. “Protesters have been opposing namaz in the open for a month now. Residents want the site turned into a market. Another meeting is scheduled next week and we hope to reach an agreement then,” said ACP Aman Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/slogans-bhajans-again-as-group-opposes-namaz/articleshow/87050965.cms||Sagrika Kissu

With this, the tally has reached 193 this year — which officials say is the highest in the past 10 years. The caseload was recorded at 157 on October 13 and increased to 178 on October 14 and 193 on October 15. According to officials, 15-20 new cases are being confirmed by two approved labs in the city daily. Meanwhile, a few private hospitals reported that they are overloaded with dengue cases with no vacant beds available at many places. However, most of these cases are not being added to the tally by the health department, they alleged. Even as cases are at a high, health officials said that compared to other districts in the region, cases have remained low in GB Nagar so far. Also, no clusters have been identified this year. For the past few years, Nithari and Chijarsi have been spotted as dengue hotspots. There are higher cases from Jewar this year. “In 2021, however, cases are spread out and there is no cluster identified yet. There are dengue cases from all over the district, including the rural belts,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. He added that better sanitisation and no waterlogging has helped keep the numbers relatively lower in GB Nagar than other districts. He added that personal hygiene and not letting water collect in homes can help reduce dengue cases. Sharma said, “The dengue mosquito is very sophisticated and breeds only in clean water. It also flies very low and usually bites below the knee. People have to just ensure that they are not letting any water collect inside their homes where mosquitos can breed. Also, people should take enough precautions by wearing full-sleeved clothes and using mosquito repellants.” At home, fresh water usually gets collected in terraces, balconies or in buckets in the washroom. Places such as pots, coolers, bird feeding trays in balconies, discarded tyres and thermocol cups are also risky places. Water should either be drained or kerosene should be poured over it if breeding is found. Meanwhile, the four scrub typhus patients of the district have all been treat-ed and discharged. Four leptospirosis patients have also been found, of which three are fine while one is still under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/dengue-cases-in-noida-near-200-highest-count-in-10-yrs/articleshow/87050946.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Authorities and local governments are resolving the situation based on “market-oriented and rule-of-law principles”, People’s Bank of China official Zou Lan said on Friday. The central bank has asked lenders to keep credit to the real estate sector “stable and orderly”, said Zou, who is head of the financial market department. Concerns are growing that the cash crunch at Evergrande is spilling over to other developers as President Xi Jinping maintains strict measures to cool the property market. Contagion fears intensified over the past two weeks after a surprise default by Fantasia Holdings Group and a warning from Sinic Holdings Group that its default was imminent. “In recent years, the company failed to manage its business well and to operate prudently amid changing market conditions,” Zou said. “Instead it blindly expanded and diversified.” The central bank is urging property firms and their shareholders to fulfill their debt obligations, Zou said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/china-says-risks-from-evergrande-controllable/articleshow/87053743.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Sound check: Bapu’s ashram road is noisiest spot in Ahmedabad city||AHMEDABAD: Back in 1917, Mahatma Gandhi chose a large swathe outside the walled city to set up his satyagraha ashram. He sought the quiet — away from the roaring mills and humdrum of city life — where he could carry out his experiments with nonviolence in peace. Almost 103 years later, constant honking from vehicles fighting for space on the road outside Bapu’s ashram has shattered its peace. In fact, the stretch between the Sabarmati ashram and Vadaj Circle records the highest noise levels in the city. While the acceptable levels as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) are 45 to 55 decibels (dB), the noise in this stretch is measured anywhere between 77 and 83 dB. It’s worth mentioning here that Ashram has been marked as a ‘silent zone’ by traffic police. A comprehensive study to quantify noise annoyance levels in the city was carried out by researchers from Indus University, Pandit Deendayal Energy University and Gujarat Power Engineering and Research Institute. They found that the average noise levels (Lavg) in the city were largely in the range of 69-80 dB while the acceptable limits for residential areas is 45-55 dB and that of the commercial areas is 55-65 dB. The extensive field campaign done to assess average noise levels comprised 123 locations which represents around 102.7 sq km of the western area of Ahmedabad. “The noisy areas included IIM and Sola crossroads, CIMS hospital, Jivraj Park junction, D-Mart and Brand Factory junction, Shyamal, Helmet and Naranpura junctions,” says the lead author of the study Assistant Professor Ketan Lakhtariya of Indus University. His colleague Dr Anurag Kandya, associate professor from PDEU, says, “While the average noise levels of the city are largely in the range of 69-80 dB, 49% locations had average noise levels above 74 dB which was much more than acceptable levels. This is really worrying in the context of the city's rising population which will hit 1 crore by 2035.” While explaining the importance of the study, Prof Kandya says, “Hearing is a sense that humans cannot switch on or off on their own. When sounds interfere with thinking, focusing, working, conversing, listening, or sleeping, they become noise. And increased interference creates annoyance. In this study, we also approached 396 individuals from different parts of the city to find out how noise affects them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sound-check-bapus-ashram-road-is-noisiest-spot-in-ahmedabad-city/articleshow/87053748.cms||Paul John
---||Business||Reliance co buys 40% in Manish Malhotra brand||NEW DELHI: Reliance Brands, part of the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, has picked up 40% stake in Manish Malhotra, the Indian couture brand widely favoured by well-heeled Bollywood celebrities. The move, aimed at bolstering Reliance’s portfolio of home-grown designer labels, follows the likes of rival Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail (ABFRL) that has acquired significant stakes in ethnic wear brands such as Tarun Tahiliani, Sabyasachi and Jaypore. Apart from expansion of physical retail, the partnership between Reliance and MM Styles, parent of the Manish Malhotra brand, may lead to offerings in different price brackets — an effort to democratise the appeal of the label known for its elaborate and expensive wedding wear. However, the deal size wasn’t disclosed. With the domestic fashion industry reeling from the onslaught of the pandemic, even ABFRL has adopted a similar strategy with its deal with fashion designer Tahiliani, as it will own 80% stake in a new entity that will develop and launch affordable premium ethnic wear and accessories. “This is the perfect time for these powerhouses to go shopping for Indian designer wear labels, as their sales have been poor compared to international luxury brands. They need the capital to stay afloat,” said an industry veteran who did not wish to be named. After Reliance’s investment, Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the 16-yearold brand, will continue at the helm as managing and creative director. Reliance owns stakes in two other indigenous labels, Satya Paul and Raghavendra Rathore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reliance-co-buys-40-in-manish-malhotra-brand/articleshow/87053780.cms||John Sarkar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Centre asks Kerala to supply power||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In an apparent move to explore unconventional options to tide over the lingering power crisis in the country, the Union power ministry has requested the state government to pump into the national power grid the maximum hydel power Kerala can produce during the off-peak daytime, till October 31. Union power secretary Alok Kumar in his letter to chief secretary V P Joy, has sought urgent support of the state as the power crisis owing to coal shortage is “likely to take some time to stabilize”. “`There is scope for enhancing power generation support from the storage-based stations in your state (Idukki 780 MW), especially during off peak hours, ie, 8am to 6pm,” the letter dated October14 said. KSEB authorities said the board has no reasons to reject the suggestion, especially since the state is receiving heavy rains in the catchment areas of major hydel stations, including Idukki, and there is expendable level of water for additional power generation during daytime. As the storage level in dams, including Idukki, has crossed 86% of their storage capacity, the board has already jacked up the power generation from hydel stations. According to sources, the central power ministry is yet to hold discussions with KSEB on how to fashion this one-of-thekind power deal. KSEB is already giving hydel power during off peak hours to agencies with which it had entered into power banking agreement. Owing to the drop in the power consumption level during the rains, the board even sells out hydel power in the power exchange during the off peak. However, the abundance of water in dams won’t help KSEB to ward off the power shortage during the peak hours, ie, from 6pm to 10pm. As on October 15, the board has no shortage of power during the peak hour. The availability of power for the day is 3,426 MW against the expected demand of 3,400 MW. However, the mix of energy is such that the in-house generation as on October14 was 36 MU against the sluggish demand of 69 MU for the day. In case there is a sharp cut in the power from the central generating stations or from other generators with whom KSEB has tied up for power during peak hours, Kerala could still face severe power shortage during night hours. Sources said KSEB is likely to demand the power ministry to either swap the hydel power being given during the off peak with the power from central generating stations during the peak hours or pay a fair price per unit. The board has recently bought power at the rate as high as Rs 20 from the power exchange during the coal shortage-induced power crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-asks-kerala-to-supply-power/articleshow/87053814.cms||---
---||Business||US pips China as India’s largest trading partner||NEW DELHI: The US has overtaken China as India’s largest trading partner, thanks to faster growth during the first nine months of 2021. Data collated by the commerce department showed that during January-September, two-way trade between India and the US jumped 50% to $28 billion. A comparatively slower 46% rise with China saw bilateral trade increase to $25.3 billion. China has, however, narrowly managed to retain the top spot during the first four months of the current financial year, for which disaggregated data is available with the government. During April-July, India’s trade with China was estimated at $36.6 billion, against $36.5 with the US. During the first nine months of 2021, a low base and pent-up demand have seen overall trade jump 50% to $231 billion. Countries such as Australia, the UAE and Belgium are seeing a much sharper increase. Data collated by the commerce department showed that among the major trading partners, the steepest increase was in the case of South Africa, which saw an increase of 91.4% to $5.9 billion. Similarly, in the case of Australia, trade jumped over 85% to $6.4 billion. Trade with Belgium increased by nearly 80% to $6 billion, while UAE saw a rise of 67%, with the value of trade pegged at $20 billion. For some of the Asian trading partners, the rise was comparatively slower. For instance, during January-September, trade with Indonesia increased by 48.4% to $6.1 billion, while that with Thailand was 60% higher at $3.8 billion. A large part of the increase in trade is on account of higher commodity prices, especially metals, with oil prices accounting for the surge in recent months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-pips-china-as-indias-largest-trading-partner/articleshow/87053840.cms||Sidhartha

Brent crude passed the key level in intraday trading on Friday, while US crude futures also advanced. The shortage of gas and coal is triggering extra demand for oil products from the power market, and some banks expect the switch to boost prices further during winter in the northern hemisphere. It’s also starting to deplete stockpiles. Brent is set for a sixth straight weekly gain in the wake of robust demand and limited supply. China also issued a long-awaited new batch of quotas for its private refiners to buy more crude, further pushing up consumption||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/brent-crude-at-85-as-energy-crisis-stokes-demand/articleshow/87053851.cms||---

The move came after several complaints from residents of the city. In a letter, the commission mentioned that the authority has failed to take any action in the past fortnight. “The complaint was also forwarded by the Commission to Noida chairman... for examining the matter and taking urgent necessary action. However, the report from the chairman is awaited despite a lapse of more than a fortnight. Prompt action is expected by the authorities concerned in the matter particularly during the period, which is critical for air quality. Meanwhile, the air quality has started dipping, remaining in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor' category’,” stated the letter to the Noida Authority. The complainant, Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77, had mentioned that there are several kinds of pollution-related violations, to which the authorities have been turning a blind eye. He added pictures along with their location describing the problem. While construction dust was the problem in most areas, other problems included transportation of uncovered construction material, repetitive digging of roads by telecom companies, road repair with material lying uncovered and no water sprinkling at construction sites. “We have made several complaints to the authorities, UPPCB, CPCB and other departments but nobody seems to be interested in taking any action against the violators. Soon, the air quality will be very poor and restrictive measures will be imposed on all residents rather than penalising these offenders,” said Gupta. A senior official from Noida Authority said that it has already established a Quick Response Team (QRT) and a helpline to manage pollution-related complaints. “The department has also asked all its contractors to start misting and sprinkling water at construction sites. Smog guns are also being installed in busy areas,” said the official. Meanwhile, the air quality has dipped to the ‘poor’ category in Greater Noida in the past two days and ‘moderate’ in Noida. Recently, officials said that the CAQM in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the adjoining areas is considering a modification in certain measures under the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ categories of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to fight air pollution in the winter months. The commission would also review some of the measures enforceable for the ‘poor’ to ‘severe’ pollution days. The GRAP sub-committee had submitted its observations on October 12. A meeting that was scheduled to take place on Thursday could not be held and a decision will now be taken in a few days, said an official||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/act-against-pollution-violations-noida-told/articleshow/87051285.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state had 9,428 active cases on March 16 after which cases rose rapidly before steadily declining. Yadgir had zero active cases, the only district in Karnataka to have no active infections. However, active cases in the state rose to 9,671 on Friday. Bengaluru continued to have the lion’s share of active cases, with 6,637 (69.3%) people still being treated for the disease. Eleven other districts have more than 100 active cases. At 392, Mysuru had the most active cases after Bengaluru, followed by Dakshina Kannada (373), Hassan (362), Tumakuru (292), Chikkamagaluru (231), Uttara Kannada (161), Shivamogga (145), Udupi (144), Kodagu (128), Ballari (126) and Mandya (107). In 17 districts, the number of people nursing the infection is less than 100. These include five districts that have less than 10 active cases. Raichur has eight, while Bagalkot, Bidar and Haveri have six each, and Gadag has three Covid patients who are yet to beat the infection. Incidentally, Karnataka had the highest active caseload burden during the peak of the second wave in mid-May, when several patients with moderate to severe infections scrambled to find hospital beds. On three consecutive days beginning May 15, the state’s Covid active cases had breached six lakhs. By June 1, active cases reduced to 2.9 lakh and it gradually reduced thereafter. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, state Covid Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said active cases were expected to dip below 10,000 in September. “There is no working definition or any established criteria for the end of a wave. However, we can say that the second wave is coming to an end and maybe the pandemic is entering an endemic stage,” said Dr Sudarshan. The TAC chairperson added: “The virus continues to be in circulation mainly due to its infectivity and the poor Covid-appropriate behaviour. Currently, the virus is no longer virulent, and it has not led to hospitalisation of all cases.” Another expert told TOI that while the significant decrease in active cases is a good sign, the state must continue to maintain the momentum in the fight against the pandemic through surveillance strategies. This includes identifying infections by testing all symptomatic people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/active-cases-in-karnataka-lowest-in-212-days/articleshow/87053622.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The 11km rafting trip has eight rapids and is a big draw among tourists. Rafts leave from Ganesh-Gudi, a tourist hub located on the Kali river in the Western Ghats, and reach Moulangi. A trip costs Rs 1,350 per participant. JLR has currently assigned two operators. Rafting commenced on October 7 and, so far, the two operators have conducted a total of 15 trips with more than 200 enthusiasts enjoying the sport. The sport depends heavily on water being released from Supa dam. JLR employees say tourist footfall has seen a steady increase after long rafting resumed, but they could not give actual numbers. They say the increase had kindled hopes of tour operators recovering losses incurred due to lockdowns and restrictions. Although a few private operators offered 3km and 4km rafting trips after restrictions were lifted, the state government did not permit JLR to resume water sport activities. Dandeli is the only tourist hub in southern India which offers river rafting, and people from across the country journey to the tourist destination to indulge in the sport. Appa Saheb Nadaf, a manager at JLR, said the resort offered rafting only for four days as two days were spent in preparation. Another day was lost since water was not released from the dam. Nadaf said: “There are other sports like boating, zipline, jacuzzi and water roller among others on offer,” he said. “Expectations are high as rafting commenced for the first time after the pandemic struck. Now, the crowds are about average [compared to pre-pandemic times], but we expect it to increase on coming weekends.” Rahul Bavaji, a homestay operator at Dandeli, said resumption of rafting is a good sign for business. “Many potential visitors were enquiring about long rafting. JLR has done well to resume business,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-after-19-months-rafting-resumes-at-dandeli/articleshow/87053687.cms||Shreyas HS

TPR has fallen below 1% even in districts such as Mysuru, Hassan and Uttara Kannada, where cases surged over the past few weeks before gradually declining. The state average test positivity rate (TPR) is slightly less than 0.4%. “We are proud that all districts have recorded a TPR below 1%,” said K Sudhakar, health and medical education minister, He said the government had been working hard towards this end, and that it was especially delightful as it comes on the occasion of Vijaya Dasami/Dasara. “About 11 districts have a TPR above the state average, with Mysuru being the highest at 0.9%. This may be due to Dasara celebrations,” Sudhakar said. “However, we have been prepared and we have taken adequate measures. Nineteen other districts have a TPR that is below state average. We are also proud that around six districts have achieved zero or near zero TPR.” War Room data shows that as on October 13, Yadgir had zero TPR, while the rate in Bagalkot, Haveri, Gadag, Kalaburagi and Koppal was near zero. But the minister warned: “We are not protected until everyone is protected. With the widening vaccination coverage, coupled with combined efforts of the health staff, Covid warriors, and frontline workers, we are confident we will overcome the pandemic.” Not advisableHowever, Dr Giridhara R Babu, epidemiologist and member of the state Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said it is “not advisable” to depend on “only one” metric like TPR to assume that the disease has been contained. Dr Babu said many factors like health infrastructure and percentage of older population, besides indicators like case fatality rate (CFR), vaccination, testing and hospitalisation rates among others need to be continuously monitored. He said genomic sequencing should be increased to quickly detect new variants. Health department officials say testing has been the cornerstone of the fight against Covid right from the beginning. “We didn’t decrease the number of tests even when cases were low. We realise it is crucial to catch infections early if and when there is a resurgence of cases,” a senior official said. Over the past several weeks, the state has continued to conduct between 1.1 lakh and 1.3 lakh tests a day. As reported by TOI earlier, the TAC, after a meeting on October 10, had recommended that the government reduce the number of tests to 1.1 lakh per day in the state, as the positivity rate had gradually fallen. TAC members said Bengaluru must conduct 50,000 tests a day, while the rest of Karnataka could conduct 60,000 tests. However, the government is yet to issue an official order on revised testing targets. Officials working on surveillance measures say border districts like Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru were at a higher risk due to the high number of cases reported in Kerala over the past couple of months. “It’s good to see TPR has fallen below 1% in those districts too,” another health official said. “But low cases do not mean no cases. Covid is still very much around and people must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/positivity-rate-below-1-in-all-karnataka-districts-but-experts-warn-against-complacency/articleshow/87053891.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Business||Bitcoin tops $60k again on ETF hopes||Bitcoin hit $60,000 for the first time in six months on Friday, nearing its alltime high, as hopes grew that US regulators would allow a futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move likely to open the path to wider investment in digital assets. Cryptocurrency investors have been waiting for approval of the first US ETF for bitcoin, with bets on such a move fuelling its recent rally. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency rose 4.5% to its highest level since April 17, and was last at $59,290. It has risen by more than half since September 20 and closing in on its record high of $64,895 hit in April. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to allow the first US bitcoin futures ETF to be traded next week, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Such a move would open a new path for investors to gain exposure to the emerging asset, traders and analysts said. “ETFs open up a raft of avenues for people to gain exposure, and there will be a swift move to these structures,” said Charles Hayter, CEO of data firm CryptoCompare, which tracks ETF products. “It reduces the frictions for investors to gain exposure and gives traditional funds room to use the asset for diversification purposes.” Bitcoin’s moves on Friday were spurred by a tweet from the SEC’s investor education office urging investors to weigh risks and benefits of investing in funds that holds bitcoin futures contracts, said Ben Caselin of Asiabased crypto exchange AAX. Several fund managers, including the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, ProShares, Invesco, Valkyrie and Galaxy Digital Funds have applied to launch bitcoin ETFs in the US. Crypto ETFs have launched this year in Canada and Europe, growing in popularity amid surging interest in digital assets. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/bitcoin-tops-60k-again-on-etf-hopes/articleshow/87053900.cms||---

With very few deceased heart donors in the state, this is a crucial step to save lives. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a batteryoperated, mechanical pump, which when implanted in patients with heart failure, helps the bottom left chamber of heart (left ventricle) to pump blood to the body. LVAD implantation is a complex and rare procedure and there are only a few hospitals in India performing it at the moment. The cardiothoracic surgical team at VPS Lakeshore Hospital implanted the artificial heart in the female patient, who had been under treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy for the past six years. She was admitted to the hospital with cardiogenic shock, breathing difficulty and hypotension on September 13. The patient’s condition deteriorated with ongoing heart failure and renal failure. She had increased liver enzymes due to congested liver, and was under multiple supports to maintain the blood pressure. As her condition worsened, she was put on VA ECMO, three days after hospitalization. This ensured that her kidney and liver functions could be brought back to normal yet her cardiac function was just 10%, which was too low to wean off VA ECMO. The only option to bring her back to life was a heart transplant but the waiting period for heart recipients in the state in recent times has been unpredictable. That is when they decided to implant an artificial heart. “As organ donation is in a plateau phase in Kerala, the artificial heart implant is a boon in the present scenario as a bridge to transplant as well as destination therapy,” said Dr Sujith D S, cardiothoracic surgeon, VPS Lakeshore Hospital, Kochi, who led the surgery. “We performed a 9-hourlong rare surgery that saved her life. Now, the patient is safe and sound, she has started taking food orally and is in recovery phase,” said cardiac anaesthesiologist Dr M S Nebhu. The device implanted on her is HeartMate 2 (second generation ventricular assist device) and the LVAD costs between Rs 45 lakh and Rs 90 lakh in India. However, the patient’s family didn’t want to disclose the cost. The patients also have to charge the battery every 18hrs. As per doctors, the patient can live an improved, long and near normal life. Life expectancy with LVAD is more than12 years now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/keralas-first-artificial-heart-implant-performed-in-kochi/articleshow/87053846.cms||---

But now, the government has announced that the staff should be paid before Diwali so that they can have a joyous festival season,” said a senior education department official. The teachers welcomed the move, calling it “nothing less than a victory”. “We have been fighting for our rights relentlessly and it took almost a year for the government to address our concerns. But this is still half the work done. We are yet to get salaries for September and October. Also, other funds are pending. We urge the government to release those as well,” said Satish Khatana, district president, Mewat Model School Employees’ Welfare Association. Teachers had also demanded that the government implements its commitment made in 2016 that all the model schools in the district will be linked with the education department so that teachers and students get benefits like mid-day meals, free books, better pay and employee benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/funds-released-for-teachers-salaries-in-nuh-model-schools/articleshow/87051308.cms||---

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was expected to open it to commuters on Friday. Now, NHAI officials have said it will be completed within this month. The latest deadline had been announced by Union minister of road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, during a visit to Gurgaon last month. Speaking after an inspection of work on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway, Gadkari had stated that the underpass would be thrown open by October 15 and would “provide relief to people in both Delhi and Haryana”. “There have been some delays, and we are trying to complete the work as quickly as possible. There is no big shift in the deadline. The underpass will be completed within October,” an NHAI official said. “The paving of a portion of the road is remaining, as well as some miscellaneous work such as lighting. In addition, there has been a bit of an issue with labour as well lately because of the festive season. We are working on the underpass and it will be completed in the next few days,” the official added. Commuters, meanwhile, expressed scepticism about the revised deadline. “We have heard multiple times that the underpass will be opened soon, or that so and so date has been set for its completion. I have no faith in the deadlines set by NHAI or their claims,” said Ambience Island resident Partha Chatterjee, who has to cross the Gurgaon-Delhi border daily to reach his office in Cyber City. Work on the underpass had started in January 2019. The structure was part of a wider project to decongest the expressway, with a U-turn flyover also being constructed at Shankar Chowk. The flyover was opened to commuters in November last year. NHAI had initially set an deadline of 18 months for completion of the project, but officials said work was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent shortage of labour, repeated bans on construction due to high pollution levels, waterlogging due to heavy rainfall, and delays in shifting toll gates and other utilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ambience-mall-underpass-misses-oct-15-deadline-too/articleshow/87051315.cms||Sakshi Dayal

They have said despite repeated complaints, the authorities have not responded nor pulled up offenders. “Along both internal roads of Sector 112, one can see construction material lying in the open. We point this out every year but no serious action is taken,” said Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77. Construction and horticulture waste can also be seen along the roads in sectors 116, 51, 11 and 79. Vishnu Saini, a resident of Sector 137, said: “The NGT directives, like keeping construction material and waste covered and controlling dust near roads, are supposed to be in place for the entire year. But local authorities start sending notices to offenders only in October. Even after that, most contractors don’t follow the norms.” There are several stretches where mechanical sweeping is done but only on one side of the main roads. In most of the 7x sectors, green patches have been created but dust gets accumulated right next to these places, residents have alleged. “What is the point of mechanical sweeping if only half of a road is covered? I have complained to the authority several times about this, but nothing has been done,” Gupta added. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials said the local authorities have been asked to take note of such issues by mid-October and get the waste removed. “We have given them time to comply with the NGT orders. If no action is taken, we will have to penalise the parties involved,” said Utsav Sharma, the regional officer, UPPCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/residents-flag-waste-lying-in-open-pollution-body-says-will-take-action/articleshow/87051322.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Business||IGI back on list of busiest airports||NEW DELHI: Delhi-Mumbai is back as one of the world’s busiest domestic routes and Delhi is again in the list of the busiest airports globally this month, thanks to the recovery in India’s air traffic post the deadly second Covid wave. UK-based air consultancy firm OAG data shows Delhi-Mumbai as the tenth busiest domestic route globally this month in terms of seat capacity deployed by airlines at 4.8 lakh. OAG data, in terms of seats deployed by airlines on both domestic and international flights, shows Delhi’s IGI Airport as the 10th busiest globally with 28.4 lakh seats this month — up four spots from 14th rank in October 2019. The recovery, as expected, is in the domestic sector as restrictions on international flights continue. From Monday (October 18) airlines can deploy as many scheduled domestic flights as they did in pre-pandemic times. The three busiest domestic routes this month are: Jeju International-Seoul Gimpo (15.4 lakh), Beijing-Shanghai Hongqiao (7.8 lakh) and Sapporo New Chitose-Tokyo Haneda (over 7 lakh). No international route to/ from India figures in the list of OAG’s top 10 this month that is led by: Antalya-Moscow Sheremetyevo; Dubai-Riyadh and Dubai-London Heathrow. Delhi-Dubai and Mumbai-Dubai used to be among the busiest routes in not just pre-pandemic but also post-Covid times before the deadly second wave, following which entry restrictions were imposed to travel from the country. The restrictions are gradually being relaxed. OAG data shows domestic cum-international seat deployment by airlines is highest (45.8 lakh seats) this month at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson — for years the world’s busiest airports. This is followed by Chicago O’Hare (36.7 lakh) and Dallas / Fort Worth (36.6 lakh).

The trio was later arrested. On Thursday afternoon, the woman, her younger brother and her friend were travelling on a bike when it ran out of fuel near the Roopwas bypass on GT Road in Dadri, according to police. The woman’s brother and her friend started dragging the bike while she walked a few metres behind them. A red car approached and three men sitting inside, identified as Nitin, Nishant and Manav, allegedly started passing lewd comments. The woman alleged that one of the men tried to pull her inside the car, following which she shouted for help. Her brother and his friend rushed to her, confronted the men and took away the keys of their car. The accused started arguing with the woman’s brother and her friend. One of them slapped the woman’s brother that escalated the conflict, said Dadri SHO Pradeep Tripathi. A group of 10 people soon gathered at the spot, thrashed the trio and also broke the windows of the car. Nitin called his uncle, who arrived in an SUV. The men fled and left Nitin’s uncle and the red car behind, which was damaged by the mob. A team of Dadri police arrived at the spot after receiving information about the incident from a passerby and took the complaint from the woman and her brother. Nitin, Nishant and Manav were arrested from near the Bisada gate early Friday and booked under IPC sections 354A (physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt). An SUV was recovered from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/3-men-harass-ba-student-try-to-pull-her-into-car-thrashed-by-mob/articleshow/87051330.cms||---

Car owner Sachin Kumar’s brother said head constable Balraj Singh had been approaching his family members who stay in Greater Noida’s Derin village and threatening them for some time. Manish Bhati (26), Sachin’s brother, said that around 10am on Friday, Balraj reached their house in New Delhi’s Vinod Nagar area with two men. “Ever since we complained about him, we have been getting indirect threats. He has been approaching our family members through the pradhan of Derin village. They are being asked to settle the matter and if they want to stay in the village, they should not complain against Balraj. He has been claiming that he has spent 23 years in the Gautam Budh Nagar district and is very influential,” he said. “On Friday, Balraj came to our house with another man and my uncle. He was carrying a pistol. I avoided talking to him but he stayed put for over an hour,” Manish said. “We never asked him for any money. But he said we had been demanding Rs 5 lakh from him.” According to Manish, on Thursday, Balraj’s wife called him up and asked him to settle the matter. “She told me they would be destroyed if we pursue the matter,” he said. Sachin and Manish have now demanded police protection. Although Sachin had lodged a complaint with Beta 2 police station alleging Balraj had been using a number plate that matches their car’s details, no FIR has been filed.

---||Ghaziabad||Greater Noida: Youth alleges threat from cop after plaint||GREATER NOIDA: A day after TOI reported that a head constable posted with Ghaziabad police was found with a stolen car, a youth whose vehicle details match with the number plate the cop has been using has alleged that the policeman threatened his family. Car owner Sachin Kumar’s brother said head constable Balraj Singh had been approaching his family members who stay in Greater Noida’s Derin village and threatening them for some time. Manish Bhati (26), Sachin’s brother, said that around 10am on Friday, Balraj reached their house in New Delhi’s Vinod Nagar area with two men. “Ever since we complained about him, we have been getting indirect threats. He has been approaching our family members through the pradhan of Derin village. They are being asked to settle the matter and if they want to stay in the village, they should not complain against Balraj. He has been claiming that he has spent 23 years in the Gautam Budh Nagar district and is very influential,” he said. “On Friday, Balraj came to our house with another man and my uncle. He was carrying a pistol. I avoided talking to him but he stayed put for over an hour,” Manish said. “We never asked him for any money. But he said we had been demanding Rs 5 lakh from him.” According to Manish, on Thursday, Balraj’s wife called him up and asked him to settle the matter. “She told me they would be destroyed if we pursue the matter,” he said. Sachin and Manish have now demanded police protection. Although Sachin had lodged a complaint with Beta 2 police station alleging Balraj had been using a number plate that matches their car’s details, no FIR has been filed. Greater Noida police said the complaint has been forwarded to Ghaziabad police. DCP (Greater Noida) Abhishek Jha said they are yet to get a complaint about any threat. Kavi Nagar circle officer Anshu Jain who is investigating Balraj’s role said she was unaware of the family getting threats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/youth-alleges-threat-from-cop-after-plaint/articleshow/87056491.cms||Shikha Salaria

Footage of the horrifying incident, caught on several mobile cams, is chillingly reminiscent of the Lakhimpur Kheri deaths. Culprits in police custody on FridayVillagers chased the car on motorcycles, intercepted it after 15km and set it on fire. They beat up the two men found in the car. They are both from Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, so is the vehicle, said SP Vijay Agarwal. A police officer has been suspended for negligence, apparently because the Durga immersion procession didn’t have a police escort. The man who died was identified as 20-year-old Gaurav Agrawal.The incident took place in Pathalgaon, a small town in this tribal-dominated district, about 300km from Raipur. Scores of people, women and children among them, were in the procession that was winding its way to a ghat. In footage of the incident, they are seen dancing and chatting when a maroon Xylo rams through the crowd at high speed. Villagers blocked national highway People are thrown about, hurled on the road, and crushed under the wheels. Some cling to the bonnet in desperation but the car doesn’t seem to slow down. They are run over. The man who died was identified as 20-year-old Gaurav Agrawal. Jashpur collector Ritesh Aggarwal said the injured have been admitted to Pathalgaon district hospital. Jashpur chief medical and health officer Dr P Sudhar 12 said four of them have been referred to Raigarh Medical College and Hospital, 100km from Pathalgaon. Gaurav’s family will be given compensation, officials said. The two suspects are Bablu Vishwakarma, 21, and Shishupal Sahu, 26, residents of Bargawan in MP’s Singrauli, about 300km from the site of the accident. Villagers gheraoed the local police station and blocked Gumla-Katni national highway, demanding action against the accused and a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the family of the deceased. “It’s a heart-wrenching incident. No one will be spared. Justice will be done to everyone,” said chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, adding that an inquiry has been ordered. “The culprits were immediately arrested. Action has been taken against the police officers who appeared guilty, prima facie,” he tweeted. BJP vice-president and former chief minister Raman Singh has demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to Gaurav’s family. “If chief minister Bhupesh Baghel can go to Uttar Pradesh, he should also visit Pathalgaon to meet the families,” he said in a video statement, adding that the incident is a “clear indication of the high morale of anti-socials and ganga smugglers and deterioration of law and order”. “It’s clear from the video that no police force was present with the Durga idol immersion procession. Police should have made the necessary arrangements, including diverting traffic,” he said, urging the state government to fly all the injured to AIIMS-Raipur.

---||World||US vows to pay relatives of Afghans killed in drone strike||WASHINGTON: The US Defense Department said Friday that it is committed to offering condolence payments to relatives of the 10 people who were killed in an errant US drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the Defense Department was also working with the State Department to help surviving family members relocate to the United States. Kirby said the matter arose in a meeting Thursday between Dr. Colin Kahl, under secretary of defense for policy, and Dr. Steven Kwon, founder and president of the nonprofit group Nutrition & Education International. “Dr. Kahl reiterated Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s commitment to the families, including offering ex gratia condolence payments,” Kirby said. He did not say how much money would be offered. On Aug. 29, a US Hellfire missile struck a car driven by Zemerai Ahmadi, who had just pulled into the driveway of the Ahmadi family compound. In all, 10 members of the family, including seven children, were killed in the strike. Weeks later, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, called the strike a “tragic mistake” and said innocent civilians were indeed killed in the attack. During the meeting Thursday, Kwon told Kahl that Ahmadi had work with NEI for many years, “providing care and lifesaving assistance for people facing high mortality rates in Afghanistan,” according to Kirby. The US military initially defended the strike, saying it had targeted an Islamic State group’s “facilitator” and disrupted the militants’ ability to carry out attacks during the chaotic final stage of the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan. Discrepancies between the military’s portrayal of the strike and findings on the ground quickly emerged. The Associated Press and other news organizations reported that the driver of the targeted vehicle was a longtime employee at a US humanitarian organization. There were no signs of a large secondary blast, despite the Pentagon’s assertion that the vehicle contained explosives. The drone strike followed a devastating suicide bombing by an Islamic State offshoot that killed 169 Afghans and 13 US military personnel at one of the gates to the Kabul airport in late August. Last month, McKenzie said the United States was considering making reparation payments to the family of the drone strike victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-vows-to-pay-relatives-of-afghans-killed-in-drone-strike/articleshow/87053959.cms||---

As the vehicle rolls in, a projector on it shows the villagers the safety measures to be taken in an event of a jumbo attack. The villagers are advised to stay alert. When elephants go berserk, they run through the standing crops, ram houses and injure people. In some incidents, the jumbos mow down people. Huge publicity is given by wall graffiti. Kotwals also spread the word on safety measures so that villagers remain vigilant. Dharamjaygarh forest division officer said that the elephant being a wild animal is always on the move in the forest. When the forest department officials notice a movement through the jumbo corridors, they alert the villagers and ensure no one ventures into the jumbo corridors.

Teachers say the first challenge will be to get the really young ones to wear masks properly and maintain a safe distance from each other. Then comes the challenge of getting children of all ages, who have spent nearly two years at home, to adhere to school and academic discipline. Parents are divided on sending children back to school, but many say they have no problem if environment is clean and Covid protocols are in place. Sripriya Raaj from Kolathur, who was willing to send her daughter back to school,said classrooms should not be crowded like pre-Covid days and the restrooms must be clean. “My daughter is quite bored staying at home and she wants to go to school. She is missing her friends, teachers and outdoor activity,” she said. Another parent Anjum said sending children to school is better than the online classes. “Students will be active in physical classes,” she said. Grishma Davey, coordinator for primary section, Vidyodaya Girls Higher Secondary School in T Nagar, said, the priority after reopening should not be academics, but building a rapport with the children. “We have to get to know our kids because we haven’t seen them for 19 months. It will then be easier to make academic progress.” Working parents are more willing to send their kids to school, said another teacher. Deepina Sinthu Tamilselvan, KG coordinator, Alwin International Public School in Padappai said, “The children lived in a comfortable environment with their parents. We have to make sure that school also will be fun in the first few weeks.” “While 70% of parents wanted physical mode classes for standard VI to VIII, only 50% parents were for physical classes for I to V,” said K Manoharan, principal of SBOA School and Junior College in Anna Nagar.. “We will plan reopening after November 15. Conducting dual mode classes for younger classes is not possible for bigger schools as they will face logistics issues,” said PG Subramanian, principal of Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidhyashram in Kilpauk. The Directorate of Elementary Education also asked government primary and middle schools to encourage reading, writing, drawing and storytelling.”Class I and II students are not used to schooling. Most of them would have lost touch with basic literacy and numeracy,” said an official from the school education department. B Viruthagirinathan, clinical neuropsychologist, said, physical classes will aid mental development, emotional maturity and social behaviour through peer interaction. “Group activities also will reduce mental stress among the children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bonding-first-lessons-next-when-schools-reopen-in-tamii-nadu/articleshow/87054193.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||India||India fears Taliban fallout in Kashmir||SRINANGAR: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi set out his Taliban worries to world leaders this week, army staged raids and battled Kashmir militants who he fears could be emboldened by the Islamists' victory in Afghanistan. Kashmir rebel shootings of civilians and police, raids by the security forces on terrorist hideouts, and insurgent infiltrations across the India-Pakistan ceasefire line have all increased in the Muslim-majority region since the Taliban overran Kabul on August 15. About 40 people have been killed in shootings and clashes in the two months since then in the Himalayan region, which has been divided since India and Pakistan became independent in 1947. Terrorists have targeted minority Hindu and Sikh civilians, while gun battles near the ceasefire line have also left soldiers and rebels dead. India has not openly blamed the Taliban takeover for the uptick in violence, but it has intensified patrols near Pakistani Kashmir and fortified some army camps, according to residents and security officials who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity. Modi told a G20 summit in Rome earlier this week that international efforts were needed to make sure Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for "radicalisation and terrorism". He has also raised India's concerns with US President Joe Biden. In September, he told the UN General Assembly that no country must be allowed to use Afghanistan "as a tool for its own selfish interests" -- a comment widely seen as a reference to neighbouring Pakistan, the chief backer of the Taliban's 1996-2001 regime. This time, Islamabad has stopped short of recognising the new Taliban government. Still, New Delhi accuses its arch-rival in Islamabad of fuelling Pakistan-based militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, which are blamed for many attacks in Kashmir. Pakistan denies the claim. India was a backer of the Soviet-puppet government in Kabul that was overthrown by mujahideen forces in 1992. In 2001 it helped the US-led forces that toppled the Taliban. And it was a major donor to the government that the hardline Islamists crushed in August. Afghan militants fought alongside Kashmir fighters in the 1980s and 1990s. About 20 Afghan "guest mujahideen" were killed and 10 were captured, according to a former Kashmiri fighter. India worries that weapons and fighters could again reach the region, over which it has fought two wars against Pakistan. "What we can say and learn from the past is that when the previous Taliban regime was in power, that time definitely we had foreign terrorists of Afghan origin in Jammu and Kashmir," said India's military chief of staff General M.M. Naravane. "So there are reasons to believe that the same thing might happen once again." Protests are virtually impossible in Kashmir because of restrictions imposed by Delhi since the region's semi-autonomous status was revoked in 2019. But some in Kashmir have quietly welcomed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan as a victory against the odds that they too can aspire to one day. "If they can defeat the world's largest military power, we see a possibility that we too can win our freedom," one businessman in the main Kashmir city of Srinagar told AFP, declining to be named. A former Kashmir militant who trained in Afghanistan in the 1990s and fought alongside Afghan mujahideen in Kashmir added: "The Taliban victory has already supplied oxygen to our movement." Given India's security clampdown on Kashmir, Naravane and other military chiefs are confident that Delhi can cope with any surge. But speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior security official in Kashmir said "there is some panic" inside the security establishment. Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Wilson Centre in Washington, said Afghanistan's new rulers could inspire "stepped up unrest" in Kashmir. Taliban officials have said they want to maintain trade and other ties with India, meaning that some kind of contact will have to be maintained. "The Taliban itself won't agitate for unrest in Kashmir, but those it is aligned with likely will do so," he said. Mosharraf Zaidi, a columnist and security analyst in Pakistan, said he saw no reason the Taliban would want to "deliberately agitate the Indian authorities". Their victory, he believes, is more important for the signal it sends to "young Kashmiri boys and girls watching the images from Afghanistan".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-fears-taliban-fallout-in-kashmir/articleshow/87054406.cms||---

The American Embassy in Islamabad said that this latest donation brings the total of Covid-19 vaccine doses donated by Washington to Pakistan to over 25 million doses, Voice of America (VOA) reported.  US Charge d'affaires Angela Aggeler, the United States is proud to partner with Pakistan to get effective, life-saving Pfizer vaccinations into the arms of Pakistanis people. "This donation comes just in time for young Pakistanis over age 12 to get their first jabs," Aggeler added.  This donation comes at a time when Covid-19 infections are decreasing in Pakistan, with fewer than 1,000 new daily cases reported on average. Last week, the Pakistgovernment had eased restrictions on public movement, education activities and businesses.  According to the government data, Pakistan has so far reported 1,262,771 confirmed cases of infections, and 28,228 Covid-19-related deaths.  On Friday, officials reported that over 95 million doses have been administered in the country, including roughly 1 million in the last 24 hours alone.  The national vaccination drive was rolled out in February. Pakistan has largely relied on Chinese vaccines. However, in recent months, US donations are helping officials overcome shortages of Western-developed anti-coronavirus shots, VOA reported.  "These Pfizer vaccines are part of the 500 million Pfizer doses the United States purchased this summer to deliver to 92 countries worldwide, including Pakistan, to fulfil President [Joe] Biden's commitment to provide safe and effective vaccines around the world and supercharge the global fight against the pandemic," the US Embassy noted in its statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/us-donates-9-6million-additional-covid-vaccine-doses-to-pakistan/articleshow/87054450.cms||---

According to Ali Daruwalla, the national spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, the cost of a litre of diesel in Pune city on Saturday stood at Rs. 100.08 against Rs. 99.72 on Friday—an increase by 36 paise. With the prices of fuel witnessing a steep increase in different parts of the country including Pune since early this year and particular since more than 10 days now, the price of petrol also saw yet another increase in the city. The price of one litre of petrol in Pune stood at Rs. 110.58 on Saturday against Rs. 110.25 a litre on Friday— an increase by 33 paise. The price of petrol in Pune had breached the Rs. 110 mark for the first time on Thursday. The same day had seen the price of CNG rising up steeply standing at Rs. 62.10 from the earlier Rs. 59.50. The month of May this year had seen petrol breaching the Rs. 100 mark in the city. The rise of fuel costs this time has been attributed to high cost of international crude oil prices. However, the high central and state government taxes levied on fuel has been among the primary reasons too. While different transport unions have been demanding that fuel should come under GST. However in the recent meeting finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that it was not the right time to bring petrol and diesel under GST. “The cost of transportation will further increase and this will lead to an price hike of all commodities. Transporters cannot operate under losses and the costs have to be increased. It is frustrating but necessary,” Baba Shinde, the president of Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diesel-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-pune-for-first-time/articleshow/87054387.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kochi||Nirvana in a paddy field||A Wayanad farmer employs a novel form to put the spotlight on indigenous rice varietiesLush green paddy fields are a common sight in the rural countryside of Wayanad. But the rice field of Praseed Kumar Thayyil at Kazhambuvayal near Nambikolly stands out drawing visitors in droves-- from tourists to newlyweds looking for a unique setting for photoshoots. Kumar has for the past five years been turning his paddy field into a huge canvas and this season he has come up with a mammoth image of Lord Buddha on a 30 cent plot of his 2.5 acre paddy field by planting rice seedlings of varying hues to create the pattern. Kumar has embraced Japan’s Tanbo Ato or “rice paddy art” to serve a larger cause---to put the spotlight on the country’s incredible diversity in indigenous rice varieties and also to spur more people, including youngsters, to take up rice cultivation. He “painted” the Buddha’s picture by planting four indigenous rice varieties--- Nasar Bath from Maharashtra with dark purple plant, Chinnar from Tamil Nadu, Kerala’s indigenous variety Rakthashali and Wayanad’s own aromatic Jeerakashala. Kumar explains to visitors who come to see the rice-field art that in the fields surrounding the picture of the Buddha are 48 other rice varieties which he had collected from various parts of the country. He has been selling them, including many rare ones with medicinal properties, to other farmers. “Rice-field art has been a powerful tool to draw people’s attention to the rich diversity in our paddy varieties. It has also contributed to a renewed interest in paddy farming. Over the last one year alone, I have sold rice seeds to more than 1,000 farmers. The interest it evokes has helped in conservation of many indigenous varieties which are at risk of extinction due to the mass shift to hybrid rice varieties,” says Kumar. Hailing from a traditional farming family, Kumar took up farming after completing his degree. He was drawn to the diversity of rice varieties in Wayanad and started collecting new varieties. The passion took him to almost all major rice growing tracts of the country and he now has over 125 rice varieties, including the fragrant ones to the coloured and exotic varieties. Boka Saul from Assam is one such exotic variety which can be eaten just by soaking it in warm water. The Annuri gets ripened in one day while the Chakhao Poireiton, is a black rice variety from Manipur. A number of varieties have medicinal properties and many are tolerant to droughts and floods. Making the art works on the field by planting thousands of paddy shoots is an intricate affair. After leveling and preparing the field, grids are drawn and rice seedlings are transplanted to create the pattern. This time, he has taken the help of Prasad S, an artist from Sultan Bathery to create the art work in the field. Kumar forayed into rice-field art by attempting a map of India in 2017, which was followed by the image of the famed tusker Guruvayoor Keshavan. In 2019, he made the image of an eagle, which was washed away in the floods and in 2020, the plans to create an art work of Swami Vivekananda went astray after stray wildlife ran over the rice shoots. Kumar says now he has more coloured rice varieties with him giving him more room to create designs. “I am also trying to get the Pink Lady variety from Indonesia,” he says. Kumar says his interest in diverse verities of rice has also opened before him a niche market for them owing to their unique aroma, colour or medicinal properties. “I sell 75% of my produce from the 7.5 acres of paddy field I cultivate as seeds. I have seen selling paddy seeds of different varieties for Rs 250 per kg to Rs 5,000 per kg depending on their rarity. It was difficult to get seeds of exotic rice varieties as many traditional farmers do not share them,” he says, adding that he, however, has set a limit and sells only five varieties to individual farmers and up to 25 varieties to institutions. Kumar says he has been receiving orders for seeds from across the country through a website he has created. He has been able to get good returns and has also been supplying to retailers on online platforms. “I started by securing a handful of rice seeds of the violet-coloured Krishna Kamod variety nine years ago but now I am selling the seeds to farmers in Gujarat,” he adds.

---||World||Taliban ask officials not to carry out public executions unless directed by 'top court': Report||KABUL: The Taliban has directed local officials to refrain from carrying out punishments in public unless Afghanistan's "top court" issues the order for public execution.  The Council of Ministers has decided that no punishment will be carried out publicly when there is no need to publicise the convict and till the court issues an order, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a tweet.  "Public executions and hanging of bodies should be avoided unless the supreme court issues an order for such an action," Mujahid said was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.  "If the offender is punished, the punishment must be explained so that the people know about the crime," the Taliban spokesperson said.  Last month, the United States had strongly condemned the Taliban's plans to reinstate amputations and executions as a type of punishment in Afghanistan.  During a presser, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US stands with the Afghan people, especially with members of minority groups, and demand that the Taliban immediately cease any such atrocious abuses.  "We condemn in the strongest terms reports of reinstating amputations and executions of Afghans. The acts, the Taliban are talking about here, would constitute clear gross abuses of human rights, and we stand firm with the international community to hold perpetrators of any such abuses accountable," Price had said.  In September, multiple media reports had emerged that the Taliban's official in charge of prisons and former justice minister of Afghanistan, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, said punishments such as executions and amputations will resume in the country.  After announcing the government in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime has failed to get recognition. Aside from China, Pakistan and a handful of other countries, the rest of the world is taking a wait and watch policy while keeping an eye on the conduct of the outfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-ask-officials-not-to-carry-out-public-executions-unless-directed-by-top-court-report/articleshow/87054547.cms||---

On Wednesday, communal violence broke out in several places in Bangladesh after news broke on social media about the alleged desecration of the Holy Quran at a Durga Puja venue on the bank of Nanuar Dighi. Several puja venues were vandalized in the area of Chandpur, Chittagong, Gazipur, Bandarban, Chapainawabganj, and Moulvibazar. The clashes resulted in several casualties, reported Dhaka Tribune.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Smart kiosks for vendors lie vandalised on Marina beach||CHENNAI: The ‘smart kiosks’ procured at a huge cost and distributed to vendors on the Marina beach have been vandalised and are lying strewn all over the beach sands. According to sources within the city corporation, the vendor mafia which opposed the project has defeated the purpose of the scheme by first resisting their allotment, and then not allowing the allotted vendors to take possession of the kiosks. Change of government and non-monitoring by the high court came handy for the beach mafia, who have now occupied the sands at random and continue to pollute the beach with solid waste and used oil. The Marina beach regulation scheme itself has gone awry after the Madras high court stopped monitoring it on a dayto-day basis. Hundreds of smart kiosks readied and allotted to vendors based on high court orders with public money are rotting for months in the open at the beach. “Chennai police and the corporation that had been tasked by the high court to regulate the vending practices are mute spectators to the vandalism,” said K Santhanam, an activist. “Two months ago, when we tried to station the smart carts allocated for the vendors, there were protests from those who failed to get shops in the lot. Then we went into a lockdown. We will ensure the carts are in place soon after assessing the situation,” a senior official with the civic body said. The civic body had allotted smart carts to 900 vendors as per a Madras high court order. On the encroachments along the sidewalks on Loop Road, the official said that they will take action at the earliest. Another issue plaguing the Marina beach sands is fishermen who have set up unauthorized shops along the Loop road. The fishermen, however, say that they do not encroach road space and want the government to build stalls along the road rather than a separate market off the Loop Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-smart-kiosks-for-vendors-lie-vandalised-on-marina-beach/articleshow/87054628.cms||---

The CSB staff are agitating to press for their demands, including implementation of the revised wage scales agreed by the various stakeholders in the banking sector and retaining the mass character of the bank. The CSB staff will strike for three days from October 20. Unions in the banking sector like AIBEA, AIBOC, BEFI, and INBEF have given the strike call. All major trade unions have have extended support to the strike. Addressing a news conference, AITUC’s K P Rajendran, CITU’s Chandran Pillai, INTUC’s Sundaran Kunnathulli, BMS’ Radhakrishnan, BEFI’s T Narendran, and AIBEA’s C D Josson alleged that CSB has not yet implemented the wage revision pact agreed between the Indian Bank Association and trade unions in 2017. The leaders alleged that with the arrival of foreign investment of Rs1,200 crore to the bank in 2018, its mass character has changed with the focus now solely on corporates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bank-strike-in-kerala-on-october-22/articleshow/87054589.cms||---
---||World||Taliban to announce secondary school for girls: UN official||UNITED NATIONS: A senior UN official said Friday the Taliban told him they will announce “very soon” that all Afghan girls will be allowed to attend secondary schools. UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Omar Abdi, who visited Kabul last week, told reporters at UN headquarters that five of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces -- Balkh, Jawzjan and Samangan in the northwest, Kunduz in the northeast and Urozgan in the southwest -- are already allowing girls to attend secondary school. He said the Taliban’s education minister told him they are working on “a framework” to allow all girls to continue their schooling beyond the sixth grade, which should be published “between a month and two.” “As I speak to you today, millions of girls of secondary school age are missing out on education for the 27th consecutive day,” Abdi said. “We are urging them not to wait. Any day that we wait -- it’s a day lost for those girls that are out of school.” During the Taliban’s previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996-2001, they denied girls and women the right to education and barred them from working and public life. Since their Aug. 15 takeover of Afghanistan as U.S. and NATO forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country after 20 years, the Taliban have come under increasing international pressure to ensure women’s rights to education and work. Abdi said that in every meeting he pressed the Taliban “to let girls resume their learning,” calling it “critical for the girls themselves and for the country as a whole.” When the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harboring Osama bin Laden who masterminded the 9/11 attacks on the United States, only one million Afghan children were in school at all levels, he said. Over the past 20 years, that figure rose to almost 10 million children at all levels, including 4 million girls, Abdi said, and in the last decade the number of schools tripled from 6,000 to 18,000. “Education gains of the past two decades must be strengthened and not rolled back,” he said. But the deputy chief of the United Nations Children’s Fund said despite this progress, 4.2 million Afghan children are out of school including 2.6 million girls. If all girls are allowed to attend secondary school, Abdi said, efforts must still be made to overcome resistance from conservatives to allowing them to get a secondary education. “The authorities that I’ve met said that when they put in place the framework that they are working on, it will convince more parents to send their girls to school” because it will address concerns in conservative societies about separating girls and boys and female teachers, he said. “So, that has to be seen,” Abdi said. While in Kabul, the UNICEF deputy chief said he also visited a children’s hospital “and was shocked to see how packed it was with malnourished children, some of them babies.” Abdi said the health system and social services are on the verge of collapse, medical supplies are running dangerously low, outbreaks of measles and watery diarrhea are increasing, and polio and COVID-19 remain serious concerns. “Even before the Taliban takeover, at least 10 million children across the country were in need of humanitarian assistance to survive,” he said, “and at least one million of these children are at risk of dying due to severe acute malnutrition if they are not treated immediately.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the world to prevent the Afghan economy from collapsing and help the Afghan people, an appeal echoed by Abdi who said “the situation is critical and it will only get worse.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-to-announce-secondary-school-for-girls-un-official/articleshow/87054684.cms||---

Various government authorities and the deputy commissioners of districts have been instructed to conduct the survey. Goolihatti Shekhar, BJP MLA from Hosadurga, who chaired the committee’s meeting on October 13, in the absence of its chairperson BJP Kumta MLA Dinakar Keshav Shetty, told TOI that the survey aims to check “forced religious conversion which is rampant in some parts of Karnataka” including his home district Chitradurga. He said the representatives of the backward classes and minorities affairs, home, revenue and law departments had stated at the meeting that there are about 1,790 churches in Karnataka. The committee has asked them to find out how many of them are illegally established, he said, adding that according to the home department, 36 cases of forced conversion have been registered across the state. “The menace of forced conversion is so rampant that the perpetrators are even converting residences into churches and Bible societies. We need to find out the number of such establishments and also unauthorised Christian priests and take action against them,” said Shekhar. He said the churches and Bible societies, which have not been registered and lack permission of the directorate of minorities welfare or minorities commission, are considered ‘unauthorised.’ He said the meeting was attended by nine members while the panel comprises 20 members, with the next meeting scheduled for October 27.  Once the report is prepared, it will be submitted before the committee which in turn will be tabled at the assembly for government action. Some members to raise objection in next meeting Shekhar’s move, however, has evoked sharp reaction from other members of the panel and many have decided to oppose it in the next meeting. “Many members were absent in the meeting for valid reasons and Shekhar seems to have taken advantage of it. We will oppose it in the next meeting,” said Rizwan Arshad, Congress MLA from Shivajinagar. Shekhar is apparently particular about acting against those involved in forced conversions as he had complained that his mother was a victim as she was converted into Christianity. He had raised the issue at the monsoon session of legislature last month. Earlier this week, he claimed that his mother and four other families were brought back as part of the Ghar Wapsi programme he had launched. Archdiocese opposes moveArchdiocese of Bangalore on Friday opposed the state government’s move to survey Christian missionaries and their places of worship. Rev Peter Machado, Archbishop of Bangalore, said the exercise is unnecessary. “With this, our community places of worship as also pastors and sisters will be identified and may be unfairly targeted. We are already hearing of such sporadic incidents in the north and in Karnataka,” said Machado. “Let the government take the count of the educational institutions and health centres run by the Christian missionaries. That will give a fair idea of the service that is rendered by the Christian community to nation building. How many people are converted in these places and institutions? If Christians are converting indiscriminately then why is the percentage of Christian population reducing regularly when compared to the others? Why is the government interested in making surveys of the religious personnel and places of worship only of this community? We are sad that CM Basavaraj Bommai succumbed to pressure from fundamentalist groups” he said. He said the Madras court had recently stated that merely going to church and displaying Christian symbols does not mean that a person has converted. “The community is patriotic, law abiding and would like to be the foremost in the service of the poor and downtrodden in the country. We need support and encouragement from the government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-orders-survey-of-churches-to-check-forced-conversions/articleshow/87053650.cms||---
---||India||Climate financing area of worry, says Nirmala Sitharaman||WASHINGTON: India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman here said climate financing continues to be an area of worry as she flagged concerns over funding mechanism and technology transfer. It is unclear how the $ 100 billion per year commitment given in the wake of COP21 has been extended, Sitharaman said after the conclusion of her meetings at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank here. "From my side of course one of the issues that I did raise and it is also something which many people do take cognisance of is we actually don't know if there were any measures given to measure if money spent on a particular project by somebody will be part of that $ 100 billion," Sitharaman said. "So, what constitutes $100 billion? How do we measure if actually $100 billion has been given or only some of them has been given? So, not just that USD100 billion per year is coming or not but how do we measure that it is indeed coming or not, is also one of the issues," she said. Sitharaman said several participants both in the IMF and World Bank meetings highlighted that issue. "So funding is continuing to be a question of worry for many countries, as much as even the transfer of technology," she said. "The issue is, again, as much as it is in the fund, do we know which technology that we are asking for transfer? Do we know which are those things which have to be considered for the debate and transfer of technology," she said. Responding to a question, the finance minister asserted that her view on this was not a reflection of her dissatisfaction. "I'm not stating it's a statement of this dissatisfaction because India's commitments are fulfilled. There are only six countries which kept the nationally determined commitments. India's more than done it, and also submitted a report to show that this is what we have done. What had to be achieved by 2030, we have achieved already…almost achieved, and now we've scaled up our expectations on renewable, we are touching 450 GW,” she said. "So, I don't think I can be even for a moment, disappointed or dissatisfied, clearly from our side. We are moving with our own resources in fulfilling our commitments," the minister said. There are things to be done, she acknowledged. "It is reminding, because the level at which many countries are, the levels of development at which each one has to be able to comply with an even a nationally determined commitment itself means a lot," she said. Sitharaman also expressed concern over growing oil prices. "So even as I'm putting more money into renewables and trying to be cleaner in the energy that we produce, this price rise is something which is going to be of worry to me," she said. Responding to a question, the finance minister said that sustainable debt funding was discussed during the meetings. In addition to her meetings at the IMF and the World Bank, Sitharaman had more than 25 bilateral engagements. Sitharaman has concluded the Washington DC-leg of her US trip. From here, she will go to New York for an interactive session with the business community before flying back home. She started her week-long trip from Boston.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/climate-financing-area-of-worry-says-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/87054754.cms||---

"The reforms that we've undertaken, particularly the steps taken for the withdrawal of the retrospective tax has been mentioned by the United States Administration as a very positive step," she said. "The businesses with whom we have been interacting have also welcomed that decision," Sitharaman told reporters here at the conclusion of the Washington DC-leg of her US trip. From here, she will go to New York for an interactive session with the business community before flying back home. She started her week-long trip from Boston. "Many of them (businesses) thought it was bold and even though it took some time to come. We have also explained that they were legal compulsions before which we had to wait because some of the litigations which were going on had to come to a logical conclusion," she said. "We waited and the moment the logical conclusions were reached, we went to Parliament in withdrawing that. That's been overall very positively welcomed," she said. Responding to a question on a trade deal with the US, the finance minister said her focus was on investment incentivising agreement for which there is time till December. "We have spoken about it. The two countries would like to carry on the negotiation and conclude at the earliest," she said. "But on the larger issue of the trade itself, is something which commerce (ministry) is working together with the (American) counterpart. So, I have not engaged in depth into that," she said. No stranger to India-US relationship, as she played a key role in this during her previous stints as the commerce and defense minister, this was Sitharaman's first trip to the US after the COVID-19 pandemic hit both the countries. In addition to participating in the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank here, her visit highlighted India's economic recovery and her government's commitment to long-term reforms. On the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank discussions, Sitharaman had more than 25 bilateral meetings, the most significant of those was the India-US Economic and Financial Partnership. That meeting was co-chaired by the finance minister and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The discussions touched on key areas of economic recovery from the pandemic to macro economic outlook; cooperation on global economic matters; climate finance support to infrastructure funding and combating of financing of terrorism. She had a series of meetings with business leaders both in Boston and Washington DC. A dinner in her honour hosted by India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, at India House, was attended by top US officials, including Special Presidential Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry, World Bank President David Malpass, USAID Administrator Samantha Power and Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy.

A Long March-2F rocket carrying the Shenzhou-13 spacecraft, which means "Divine Vessel", blasted off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwestern province of Gansu at 12:23 a.m. (1623 GMT on Friday). The vessel successfully docked to the port of the space station on at 6:56 a.m. (2156 GMT), and the astronauts entered the space station's core module at 10:03 a.m., the China Manned Space Agency said. China began constructing the space station in April with the launch of Tianhe - the first and largest of the station's three modules. Slightly bigger than a city bus, Tianhe will be the living quarters of the completed space station. Shenzhou-13 is the second of four crewed missions needed to complete the space station by the end of 2022. During the first crewed mission https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/chinese-astronauts-return-afte r-90-day-mission-space-station-2021-09-17 that concluded in September, three other astronauts stayed on Tianhe for 90 days. In the latest mission, astronauts will carry out tests of the key technologies and robotics on Tianhe needed to assemble the space station, verify onboard life support systems and conduct a host of scientific experiments. The mission commander is Zhai Zhigang, 55, from China's first batch of astronaut trainees in the late 1990s. Born to a rural family with six children, Zhai carried out China's first spacewalk in 2008. Shenzhou-13 was his second space mission. "The most challenging task will be the long-term stay in orbit for six months," Zhai told a news conference on Thursday. "It will exact higher demands (on us), both physically and psychologically." He was accompanied by Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu, both 41. Wang, also born to a rural family, is known among colleagues for her tenacity. The former air force pilot first travelled to space in 2013, to Tiangong-1, a prototype space lab. She is China's second female astronaut in space, following Liu Yang in 2012. Shenzhou-13 is the first space mission for the third astronaut, Ye. After the crew returns to Earth in April, China plans to deploy six more missions, including deliveries of the second and third space station modules and two final crewed missions. China, barred by U.S. law from working with NASA and by extension on the International Space Station (ISS), has spent the past decade developing technologies to build its own. With the ISS set to retire in a few years, China's space station will become the only one in Earth's orbit. China's space programme has come far since late leader Mao Zedong lamented that the country could not even launch a potato into space. China became the third country to put a man in space with its own rocket, in October 2003, following the former Soviet Union and the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-launches-second-crewed-mission-to-build-space-station/articleshow/87054871.cms||---

An orange alert will be announced if the water level reaches 2,396.86ft followed by a red alert at 2,397.86ft. The water level on Friday was 2,391ft against the full reservoir level (FRL) of 2,403.50ft. KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP) Supriya S said that the alert was issued as per the central water commission guidelines. “The present water level is below 8ft of the red alert level. The central water commission gave permission to follow ‘dynamic rule curve’ in Idukki reservoir and at present there is no need to open the shutters of the reservoir. At present, we can raise the water level till 2,403, which is the FRL,” she said. “Due to the shortage of power in the central pool, it has been directed to increase power generation in hydel dams. With increased power generation, the water level in major hydel dams will be decreasing in the coming days,” she added. Supriya said that the rule curve will be changed after October 20 and the blue alert will be withdrawn subsequently. The next rule level will be higher than the present level. The storage of the dam on Friday was 86.03% of water in the reservoir, which was 2,392.52ft on the same day last year. The power generation at Moolamattam power plant on Thursday was 7.316mu. Meanwhile, the average water level in other major hydel dams reached nearly 90% percent of total storage on Friday. The storage level in main hydel dams on Friday was — Idukki (86%), Pamba (86), Sholayar (97), Idamalayar (87), Kundala (91), Mattupetty (90), Kuttiady (37), Thariyode (83), Anayirankal (76), Ponmudi (81), Neriamangalam (94), Peringalkuthu (43) and Lower Periyar (98).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-water-level-rises-blue-alert-issued-for-idukki-dam/articleshow/87054869.cms||---

The culprit’s luck ran out as an Army officer, whose daughter was groped last week, noted down his bike number, gave a brief but unsuccessful chase, and then lodged a complaint. Police then pieced together CCTV camera footage and tracked down the man identified as Dinesh Kumar. The resident of North Jagannathan Nagar in Villivakkam, was a student of a catering college in Delhi who began working at a hotel in Egmore after the course went pnline due to the lockdown. Most of his victims did not lodge complaints, a police officer said. A week ago, police said, a young woman was on a morning walk with her father, an Army officer, and her sister when Dinesh Kumar struck. As the woman was well behind her father and sister, Dinesh Kumar who was headed to work groped her and sped away on his bike. The woman’s father gave a brief chase and later approached police. Police began tracking his vehicle registration number, looking through footage from at least CCTV cameras. One of them caught him entering a hotel in Egmore and he was apprehended. Investigations revealed that Dinesh Kumar mostly targeted his victims early in the morning and late in the evening, using the bikes of his father and brother apart from his own. He was involved in similar incidents at Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Kilpauk and Nungambakkam. A police team has sent the details of the arrested suspect to their counterparts in the city to check if he was involved in similar offences and are pending at police station.

---||Amritsar||Can’t imagine BSF troops entering cities in Punjab for seizures, say former BSF officers||AMRITSAR: Two former senior officers of Border Security Force (BSF) feel the extension of the jurisdiction of country’s first line of defence from earlier 15km to 50km in Punjab may not help in curbing crossborder smuggling and could lead to mistrust and misunderstanding between BSF and Punjab Police, unless the former delivers quick results with significant arrests and seizures. “This was an unnecessary decision. I can’t think of BSF’s patrolling party or BSF officers going into towns and cities like Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala etc. and making seizures because this is not the mandate of the BSF. Instead the force’s mandate is to guard the border and carry out anti-smuggling and antiinfiltration activities along the international border,” said a former inspector general of BSF for Punjab frontier, M S Malhi. He said going inside 50km from the international border and carrying out an operation without the knowledge of local police was difficult in itself in a thickly populated state of Punjab. Stating that there had not been any change in the jurisdiction of police, he said even BSF’s border outposts (BoP) come under the jurisdiction of police. Justifying the earlier jurisdiction, Malhi said there was no BSF BoP beyond 15km. “The move might also affect the primary role of BSF, which is guarding the border,” he said. In case a drone enters Indian airspace and flies beyond15 km, the BSF could now chase it up to 50km and bring it down without informing police and could seize weapons. “But it is yet to be seen whether the BSF could seize narcotics airdropped by the drone since it has got limited powers under the NDPS Act beyond15 km,” he said A former deputy inspector general of BSF for Punjab frontier, Jagir Singh Sran said technical advances, like use of drones by crossborder criminals, necessitated the need to extend the BSF jurisdiction. “There has been an increase in instances of weapons, narcotics and fake currency being airdropped quite deep in the hinterland in recent past. The Centre is a timely response to meet the challenges to safeguard national security on crimes emanating from zero line,” he said. Sran clarified that the extension of BSF’s jurisdiction was not an alternative to development of anti-drone technology. He said BSF personnel would have to be trained in legal matters if it had to go in towns and cities to deal with criminals, besides number of jawans and officials would have to be increased. “There should be sufficient number of jawans and officials who would be focusing their attention in the 50km area,” he said. Sources in the police informed that the extension of BSF’s jurisdiction was being construed as “intervention” in police affairs by the BSF and it would be difficult to maintain cordial relations, leave alone the coordination, between the two forces||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/cant-imagine-bsf-troops-entering-cities-in-punjab-for-seizures-say-former-bsf-officers/articleshow/87054863.cms||Yudhvir Rana

I also passed the doctor’s exam paper and got admission to a medical college. But in 1970, when I joined the RSS, there was a turning point in my life and I came to serve in politics. I did not even dream that I would serve you people by becoming the chief minister of this state,” he said. The dialogue, titled ‘Challenge and new opportunities of Ellenabad’, was organised under the ‘Yuva Manthan with Chief Minister Samvad’ under the banner ‘Youth for New Haryana (YFNH)’ Selected doctors, teachers, bank officers, industrialists, startups, police employees, IT youth and young lawyers were included in the dialogue. During this, the CM interacted with youths named Shailendra Bainiwal, Pradeep Mahela, Ritika, Santlal and Gagan.

Diesel prices in the city touched a record Rs 100/litre, going up from Rs 64.4/litre in March 2020, an increase of Rs 35.6 in 19 months. Meanwhile, the price of petrol was Rs 109.1/litre here on Saturday. On Saturday, a litre of diesel costs Rs 102.8 in Hyderabad, Rs 102.1 in Mumbai, Rs 98.6 in Chennai, Rs 97.3 in Kolkata and Rs 94.2 in New Delhi. In Karnataka, diesel is priced above Rs 101 per litre in districts like Bellari, Chitradurga, Davangere, Kodagu, Koppal, Shivamogga and Yadgir. OMCs revise fuel prices daily based on the global refined products prices and dollar exchange rate. Fuel prices are also determined by freight and refining expenses, profit margins of oil marketing companies, dealers’ commission, central duties such as excise, and state duties such as VAT and other taxes. Truck drivers said increasing diesel prices will result in a spike in prices of essential and non-essential commodities, especially during the festival season. Many taxi and bus drivers as well as State Transport Undertakings (STUs) are also facing a bleak future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/diesel-hits-a-century-in-bengaluru-petrol-priced-at-rs-109-1-per-litre/articleshow/87054842.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Following the deaths, a police complaint was lodged against IIT-M registrar Jane Prasad and others by animal activist Harish of Bangalore on Friday. The IIT-M registrar, however, denied the allegations and said the Madras high court has been hearing a connected case and passing orders to the Animal Welfare Board of India, animal husbandry department and Greater Chennai Corporation, besides the petitioner. Officers at the police commissioner’s office confirmed receiving the complaint on Friday, and said they would now forward it to the Kotturpuram police for further inquiry. An officer at the Kotturpuram station said they would conduct preliminary inquiry and register an FIR. As per the complaint, addressed to the city police commissioner and Mylapore deputy commissioner of police, animal activist Harish K B said the registrar and the management were responsible for illegally capturing 186 healthy stray dogs and keeping them in closed confinement in cages and chains since October 4, 2020, within the IIT-M campus. “All the 186 dogs were extremely healthy, young and a majority of them were sterilised as per the ABC Rules, 2001, before the illegal capture. The strays were not provided proper care, resulting in 45 dogs dying a slow and painful death. Dr Jane Prasad has herself confessed that 45 dogs have died,” he said in the complaint. He said the dogs died because they were constantly kept in confinement in a closed environment and never had the freedom to move, walk or run around. “They were not provided with proper diet and water. This act by IIT Madras is an act of contempt of the Supreme Court.” “Invoking Sections 428 (killing, poisoning or maiming animals) and 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle or any animal) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and other Acts and laws deemed fit by your esteemed office, we request you to investigate and take suitable action against Dr Jane Prasad and her management colleagues,” he said. Registrar Jane Prasad told TOI: “We have a fulltime veternarian and five handlers taking care of the dogs on campus 24×7. Thrice a week, we give them chicken and rice twice daily. On other days we give eggs and rice twice daily.” She said: “Toys have also been provided. We have an airconditioned operation room. Some dogs take only pedigree food, we give pedigree food to them. About 10,000 square feet space has been earmarked for them and hence, there is enough running space for the animals inside the open shelters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/45-dogs-dead-activist-files-complaint-against-iit-madras/articleshow/87055000.cms||---

Residents of Maksoodpur village in Syohara block said the ongoing Ramlila performance and the spirit of Dussehra also inspired them to accord the simian a dignified send-off. Residents garlanded the dead animal and formed a procession to carry it to the cremation grounds. Over 100 residents attended the last rites performed by a priest on the banks of Ramganga river on Thursday evening. ‘It lived in our village, there was an attachment’A pyre was lit and all rituals that are observed after the death of a loved one were followed. The monkey was electrocuted to death when it came in contact with a high-tension wire. It was taken to a veterinary hospital for treatment but could not survive. Village resident and district panchayat member Jagveer Singh told TOI the village had a close bond with the monkey. “It lived in our village. We would give food to it every day. There was an attachment that we had developed with it,” he said. Nripendra Ravi, village pradhan said the monkey had died at a time when the entire town was caught in “religious fervour”. “We have a Ramlila performance going on. Monkeys are associated with Lord Hanuman, so we decided to do the cremation with full Vedic rituals,” said the village pradhan. Notably, in August, nearly 3,000 residents of Kurdi village in UP’s Saharanpur had pooled in money to perform the terahvi of a beloved bull. A week before that, a condolence meet was held for a crocodile in Gujarat’s Vadodara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/monkey-electrocuted-cremated-in-ups-bijnor/articleshow/87047502.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Agra||Villagers in Agra go bald to protest lack of development||AGRA: For years, those living in Dhanoli and surrounding villages of Agra demanded that their basic amenities be in order — waterlogged roads, potholes, overflowing drains. In response, quick fixes were patched up, just enough to hold things together for a while.  That was three years ago. But what started as a “development” problem turned serious last month — eight children died of viral fever and dengue. Locals believe it was because of the unhygienic state of their roads. On Wednesday, in a symbolic move, 12 men from these villages shaved their heads to protest against what they call “government apathy.” ‘Will boycott assembly polls if problems are not resolved’We will boycott the assembly polls if our problems are not resolved,” Anjesh Giri, a protester from Dhanoli, said. “We have discussed our problems with the district administration over and over. Before staging this protest, we submitted a memorandum to the office of the district magistrate. But no one heard us.” So, around 10am on Wednesday, along the Dhanoli road, the villagers launched an indefinite strike. Men from the 15 affected villages, 12 of them, shaved their heads and immersed their hair in the waterlogged Dhanoli road. Some protesters sat in the middle of the road — inundated as far as one could see — while others gathered under a tent that had been set up for the “mundan”. The villages of Dhanoli, Sirauli, Azizpur and the 12 others are home to about 20,000 people. “Last year, we staged a protest demanding a change. All we want is sanitation, hygiene. The local authorities had promised us they would resolve the waterlogging problem. Elected representatives, too, turned a blind eye. Eight children died of viral fever and dengue over the past month here. It was because of the lack of cleanliness and the authority’s negligence,” said Savitri Chahar, a local activist who organised the protest. “We won’t give up until the administration takes action.” Asked about the protest, chief development officer Bhimji Upadhyaya said a solution is being “planned”. He added, “We are working to solve the problem of waterlogging on Dhanoli road permanently. Work on the road and drainage will be done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/villagers-in-agra-go-bald-to-protest-lack-of-dvpt/articleshow/87047494.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Bhopal||Covid blues turn Bhopalis to SUV hues||BHOPAL: Car lovers in Bhopal now prefer Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). Following the first wave of coronavirus, when people started opting for their own cars, SUVs became their first choice. Some of the senior members of Bhopal Automobile Dealers Association (BADA) said, “50 % of four-wheelers sold in Bhopal are SUVs now.” Recently concluded Navratri festival and Ganesh Utsav before that were good for the fourwheeler segment. “There is no decline in the market ; it continues to work on the same pattern as last year”, said Ashish Pande, president of BADA, adding, “had there been no waiting list due of semiconductors, market would have shown even bigger upward trend.” Four wheeler industry in the country is currently facing a major crisis of semi -conductor supply leading to a wait list for cars up to six months. At least 60-70 per cent car models in India have been witnessing a delay of several weeks when it comes to delivery; those who have booked cars have to wait for a long time, affecting the festive season. Many people have not been able to get SUV deliveries on muhurat dates, car dealers said. “After the SUVs were introduced in Indian markets a few years ago, the car manufacturers revisited the price mechanism of these vehicles. Almost all the car manufacturing companies have introduced SUVs in the markets catering to variety of customers. Now a range of SUVs is available for less than Rs 10 lakh, leading to such a high demand”, said Pande. Meanwhile, the two-wheeler market in Bhopal continues to do “ less than expectation.” The market that had picked up a little sometime back, declined again and the number of two wheelers sold during the festival was less compared to last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-blues-turn-bhopalis-to-suv-hues/articleshow/87055189.cms||Deshdeep Saxena
---||World||Macron marks 60 years since Paris Algeria protest massacre||PARIS: President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday will become the first French head of state to take part in commemorations of the massacre by Paris police of protesters at a rally 60 years ago against France's rule in its then-colony Algeria. The events of October 17, 1961 were covered up for decades and the final death toll remains unclear. But many historians believe it could amount to several hundred. The rally was called in the final year of France's increasingly violent attempt to retain Algeria as a north African colony, and in the middle of a bombing campaign targeting mainland France by pro-independence militants. On Saturday, one day ahead of the formal anniversary, Macron will take part in a memorial ceremony for the victims at a park on the Paris outskirts from 1330 GMT. A major question is whether he issues a formal apology for the actions of the Paris police that day or expresses regret, as the president seeks to carve out a modern relationship with France's past. The Paris police chief at the time, Maurice Papon, was later found to have collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. The Elysee said the ceremony would take place in the presence of relatives of the victims, civil society activists who have campaigned for recognition of the massacre and veterans for Algeria's struggle for independence. Activists are hoping Macron, the first president born in the post-colonial era, will go further than his predecessor Francois Hollande, who acknowledged in 2012 that protesting Algerians had been "killed during a bloody repression". Campaigners want an apology, reparations for the victims or recognition that the repression constituted a state crime. The 1961 protests were called in response to a strict curfew imposed on Algerians to prevent the underground FLN resistance movement from collecting funds following a spate of deadly attacks on French police officers. Some of the worst violence occurred on the Saint Michel bridge near the Notre-Dame cathedral where witnesses reported seeing police throwing Algerians into the river Seine where an unknown number drowned. "There was a state cover-up, a state lie. There were government statements from the morning of October 18 that sought to incriminate the FLN and the Algerians," historian Emmanuel Blanchard told AFP. Macron, who is expected to seek re-election next year, may be wary about provoking a backlash from political opponents or the French police in his comments. His far-right electoral opponents, nationalists Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour, are outspoken critics of efforts to acknowledge or show repentance for past crimes. Another complication is an ongoing diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers fuelled by comments attributed to Macron describing the country as ruled by a "political-military system" that had "totally re-written" its history. A report commissioned by the president from historian Benjamin Stora earlier this year urged a truth commission over the Algerian war but Macron ruled out issuing any official apology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/macron-marks-60-years-since-paris-algeria-protest-massacre/articleshow/87055191.cms||---

The incident came to light after a video taken by one of the students in the class without the knowledge of the teacher was shared widely on social media. The teacher, identified as M Subramanian, 56, handling physics at Nanthanar government Adi Dravidar higher secondary school at Chidambaram town in Cuddalore district thrashed the Class XII student after he bunked his class on Wednesday. Police said the student on Wednesday had sought permission from Subramanian to go home to fetch his physics notebook and went out. But he joined seven other students on the third floor of the school building to bunk the class. The school headmaster, on finding the students chatting on the third floor during rounds, questioned why they were outside during class hours and took all the eight students to the class and handed them over to Subramanian. Subramanian thrashed all eight students with a cane but was particularly harsh on the student who lied to him that he wanted to go home to fetch the notebook. The teacher forced the student to kneel and beat him repeatedly on the sole and back, and kicked him several times on his thighs. One of the students in the class filmed the incident. The video was shared widely on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/school-teacher-for-thrashing-kicking-student-in-cuddalore/articleshow/87055151.cms||Bosco Dominique

The spacecraft was launched by a Long March-2F rocket at 12:23 a.m. Saturday and docked with the Tianhe core module of the Tiangong space station at 6:56 a.m., approximately six and a half hours later. The three astronauts entered the Tianhe space station core module at about 10 a.m., the China Manned Space Agency said. The two men and one woman are the second crew to move into the space station, which was launched last April. The first crew stayed three months. The new crew includes two veterans of space travel. Zhai Zhigang, 55, and Wang Yaping, 41, and Ye Guangfu, 41, who is making his first trip to space. They were seen off by a military band and supporters singing ``Ode to the Motherland,'' underscoring the weight of national pride invested in the space program, which has advanced rapidly in recent years. The crew will do three spacewalks to install equipment in preparation for expanding the station; assess living conditions in the Tianhe module and conduct experiments in space medicine and other fields. China's military-run space program plans to send multiple crews to the station over the next two years to make it fully functional. When completed with the addition of two more sections _ named Mengtian and Wentian _ the station will weigh about 66 tons, much smaller than the International Space Station, which launched its first module in 1998 and weighs around 450 tons. Two more Chinese modules are due to be launched before the end of next year during the stay of the yet-to-be-named Shenzhou-14 crew. China's Foreign Ministry on Friday renewed its commitment to cooperation with other nations in the peaceful use of space. Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said sending humans into space was a ``common cause of mankind.'' China would ``continue to extend the depth and breadth of international cooperation and exchanges'' in crewed spaceflight and ``make positive contributions to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe,'' he said. China was excluded from the International Space Station largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese program's secretive nature and close military ties, prompting it to launch two experimental modules before starting on the permanent station. U.S. law requires congressional approval for contact between the American and Chinese space programs, but China is cooperating with space experts from other countries including France, Sweden, Russia and Italy. Chinese officials have said they look forward to hosting astronauts from other countries aboard the space station once it becomes fully functional. China has launched seven crewed missions with a total of 14 astronauts aboard _ two have flown twice _ since 2003, when it became only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to put a person in space on its own. China has also expanded its work on lunar and Mars exploration, including landing a rover on the little-explored far side of the Moon and returning lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s. This year, China also landed its Tianwen-1 space probe on Mars, whose accompanying Zhurong rover has been exploring for evidence of life on the red planet. Other Chinese space programs call for collecting soil from an asteroid and bringing back additional lunar samples. China has also expressed an aspiration to land people on the moon and possibly build a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects. A highly secretive space plane is also reportedly under development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinas-shenzhou-13-spacecraft-docks-for-6-month-mission/articleshow/87055223.cms||---

The delegation will tour the sterile facilities of Aspen Pharmacare, Africa's largest pharmaceutical manufacturer, in Gqeberha (formally known as Port Elizabeth), as well as meet with other pharmaceutical manufacturers critical to the Covid-19 response, a media release said. “Since day one of the Biden administration, President Biden has stated that the only way to defeat Covid-19 is to end the pandemic both at home and abroad by vaccinating Americans at home and non-Americans abroad,” the DFC said. The US has committed to donate 1.1 billion doses of Covid vaccines worldwide and has already shipped nearly 200 million doses to developing countries – more doses than the rest of the world combined, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-development-finance-corporation-chief-to-visit-india-to-boost-vaccine-manufacturing/articleshow/87055206.cms||---

Acting on her complaint a case of triple talaq was registered against the accused husband under relevant sections of IPC and Muslim Women (Protection of rights on marriage) Act, 2019 and the investigation started. Investigating officer ASI Arvind Singh said, the survivor stated that she had got married to Sehore-based Ishaan Mansuri, a year ago.

---||World||Seven Hong Kong activists jailed over unauthorised protest in 2020||HONG KONG: Seven Hong Kong democracy campaigners, including former lawmakers, were sentenced on Saturday to up to 12 months in jail for their role in a protest last year against a sweeping national security law imposed by China. The seven had pleaded guilty to charges that included organising the unauthorised assembly on July 1, 2020, when thousands of protesters took to the streets. Police, who had banned the demonstration citinbg coronavirus restrictions, fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. The activists included Figo Chan, a former convenor of the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF); Tsang Kin-shing and Tang Sai-lai of the League of Social Democrats; former district councillor Andy Chui; and former legislators Wu Chi-wai, Eddie Chu and Leung Kwok-hung. Chan was jailed for 12 months, while the others were given sentences from six to ten months. "The nature of incitement was serious," said the judge, Douglas Yau, noting that it created the risk of violence. Beijing imposed a national security law on June 30 last year as a response to widespread anti-government protests in 2019 that roiled the city. The law, drawn up by China, sets out to punish subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. The protest took place the next day - the first full day under the new law, though civil society groups had held deminstrations on July 1 for years to champion various issues, including democratic rights. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise its wide-ranging freedoms and high degree of autonomy would be preserved. Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly denied curbing human rights and freedoms. "We could only choose civil disobedience… a peaceful, rational and non-violent way to express our demand against the national security law," Figo Chan said in mitigation. "In order to uphold the belief of civil disobedience, I decided to plead guilty, admitting that I violated the "evil public order law"." At least 370 people were arrested that day for illegal assembly and other offences, with ten involving violations of the security law, according to police. Tong Ying-kit, the first person convicted under the national security law, was sentenced in July to nine years in prison for terrorist activities and inciting secession. He was accused of driving his motorcycle that day into riot police while carrying a flag with the now-banned protest slogan "Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our times". According to the Security Bureau, more than 150 people have been arrested under the national security law. Among them, 100 people have been formally charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/seven-hong-kong-activists-jailed-over-unauthorised-protest-in-2020/articleshow/87055274.cms||---
---||World||China demands $38 million compensation for dead engineers before resuming work on Dasu Dam Project||ISLAMABAD: The "all-weather ally" of Pakistan, China has demanded $38 million compensation for the dead engineers at the Dasu Dam Project. Mushtaq Ghumman, writing in Business Recorder said that China wanted to be compensated prior to resuming work on the stalled Dasu Hydropower Project. On July 14, 2021, thirteen people, including nine Chinese engineers, two locals and two personnel of the Frontier Constabulary (FC) died and over two dozen other people sustained injuries when a bus carrying the team working on the project fell into a ravine after it was hit by a car laden with explosives. According to Secretary Water Resources, Dr Shahzeb Khan Bangash, the civil work in the project has been stalled since the attack on Chinese engineers in July, reported Business Recorder. The sources said the issue of compensation to the Chinese nationals is being discussed at a high level. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Water Resources and Chinese embassy were working closely on the compensation package, as well as, resumption of work on the project. According to sources, the Steering Committee, comprising Secretaries of concerned Ministries had constituted another Committee which deliberated on the issues linked to the Dasu project, especially the volume of compensation being demanded by the Chinese government. The Committee has constituted a Subcommittee, comprising all the relevant Ministries to discuss compensation package by taking the Chinese embassy on board as the proposed package is being termed as "irrational", said Ghumman. Secretary Water Resources, the sources said, is hopeful that the compensation issue will be sorted out within a couple of weeks, after which civil work on the site will resume. The Chinese firm, China Gezhouba Group Corp, which suspended work on the Dasu project after the bus incident, had announced negation of its decision to resume work and terminate Pakistani workers, at the request of the Pakistani government. However, the company has not yet resumed work and is saying that it will not proceed ahead until a compensation package and more security of Chinese nationals is provided, reported Business Recorder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-demands-38-million-compensation-for-dead-engineers-before-resuming-work-on-dasu-dam-project/articleshow/87055301.cms||---

"44 Palestinians have been injured today in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the districts of Beita and Bayt Dajan near the city of Nablus in the West Bank," the Red Crescent said in a statement on late Friday. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) told Sputnik that the clashes erupted near the settlement of Rehelim south of Nablus after a group of Palestinians entered here without preliminary notification. "IDF soldiers have been sent to the site to disperse the crowd until the arrival of the Israeli police," the military said. The IDF also said that two Palestinians had planted an explosive device to target the border fence that separates Israel from the Gaza Strip to illegally enter the Israeli territory. "Today in the evening, the IDF patrol spotted two suspects who tried to cross the border fence in southern Gaza Strip. They planted an explosive device that exploded soon after that," the IDF said in a statement. The two Palestinians have been detained. The relations between Israel and Palestine have been shattered for decades. Palestinians seek diplomatic recognition for their independent state on the territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which is partially occupied by Israel, and the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government refuses to recognize Palestine as an independent political and diplomatic entity and builds settlements in the occupied areas, despite objections from the United Nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/over-40-palestinians-injured-in-clashes-with-israeli-soldiers-in-west-bank-red-crescent/articleshow/87055046.cms||---

Local officials said 150 students from an Islamic junior high school were participating in the cleanup Friday along the banks of the Cileueur river bank when 21 of them slipped into the water. “The weather was good and there was no flash flood," said Deden Ridwansyah, chief of the Bandung Search and Rescue Office. “Those children who drowned were holding each others' hands. One of them slipped and the others followed,” Ridwansyah said. Nearby residents and a rescue team managed to save 10 of the students, who were sent to a nearby hospital. Rescuers used big orange inflatable rafts to search for victims and all students were accounted for when the search ended Friday night. The students apparently were not wearing flotation devices. Some reports said they were trying to cross the river, which is popular for rafting and inner tubing, when they fell in. Rains cause frequent landslides and flash floods in Indonesia, where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near flood plains. In February 2020, a flash flood killed at least six students who drowned in a river in Sleman district of Yogyakarta province.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/11-kids-drowned-10-rescued-in-indonesian-river-cleanup/articleshow/87055382.cms||---

"It seems perfectly appropriate and, in fact, completely justified for ASEAN to downgrade Burma's [Myanmar's] participation [in the summit]," the official said during a press briefing, as quoted by Sputnik. "We are supporting all efforts to promote a just and peaceful resolution to the crisis [in Myanmar], the restoration of democratic institutions and we fully respect ASEAN's decisions there."  US officials have been talking about downgrading the participation of Myanmar in future ASEAN summits and meetings, the official added.  This comes after ASEAN members decided to exclude Myanmar's army chief Min Aung Hlaing from participation in the upcoming summit in response to the military's unwillingness to engage with the regional bloc to resolve the ongoing political and humanitarian crisis in the country.  The United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and the European Union on Friday extended their support to the ASEAN special envoy for Myanmar ahead of his trip to the junta-run country.  The declaration, also inked by New Zealand, Norway, South Korea and Timor Leste, said the signatories endorsed ASEAN's efforts to "chart a course out of the current crisis in Myanmar." "We welcome the prospective visit to Myanmar by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brunei," they said.  The nations called on Myanmar to engage constructively with the ASEAN Special Envoy to also implement other aspects of the Five-Point Consensus swiftly and completely.  The visit is part of the Five Point Consensus struck by ASEAN with the junta's leader, Min Aung Hlaing, in April. The allies pledged the support of the Bruneian diplomat's attempts to facilitate its implementation, including an immediate end to violence, dialogue among all parties, and humanitarian access.  The military seized power in Myanmar on February 1, imprisoning the nation's de facto ruler Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint and prompting mass protests demanding a return to civilian rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/exclusion-of-myanmar-from-asean-summit-perfectly-appropriate-step-us-state-dept/articleshow/87055407.cms||---

---||World||New Zealand dispenses record number of jabs at 'Vaxathon'||WELLINGTON, New Zealand: New Zealand health care workers administered a record number of vaccine jabs Saturday as the nation held a festival aimed at getting more people inoculated against the coronavirus. Musicians, sports stars and celebrities pitched in for the "Vaxathon'' event which was broadcast on television and online for eight hours straight. By late afternoon, more than 120,000 people had gotten shots, eclipsing the daily record of 93,000 set in August. The event stretched into the evening. A throwback to TV fundraising ``telethon'' events that were popular from the 1970s through the 1990s, it comes as New Zealand faces its biggest threat since the pandemic began, with an outbreak of the delta variant spreading through the largest city of Auckland and beyond. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who chatted with motorists at a drive-through vaccination center in Wellington, initially set a target of 100,000 jabs for the day but upped that to 150,000 after the first target was met. She also set a target of 25,000 shots for Indigenous Maori, whose vaccination numbers have been lagging and who have been hit hard by the latest outbreak. National carrier Air New Zealand converted a Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane into a vaccination clinic for the day, issuing people boarding passes on ``Flight NZVAX.'' Singer Lorde beamed in from abroad, saying she couldn't wait to come back home to play a concert and have everyone get sweaty and dance. ``I am the first person to admit that I find getting injections really icky, but ever since I was a kid, I have treated myself by going to the bakery after an injection, normally for a custard tart,`` she said. ``So you could do that.'' New Zealand has so far used only the Pfizer vaccine. For much of the pandemic, New Zealanders have lived completely free from the virus after the government successfully eliminated each outbreak through strict lockdowns and contact tracing. That zero-tolerance strategy failed for the first time after the outbreak of the more contagious delta variant began in August. Until then, New Zealand was slow to immunize its population. It since has been making up for lost ground. Before the Vaxathon, about 72% of New Zealanders had received at least one dose and 54% were fully vaccinated. Among those aged 12 and over, the proportion was about 83% and 62% respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/new-zealand-dispenses-record-number-of-jabs-at-vaxathon/articleshow/87055434.cms||---
---||World||Former US President Bill Clinton "doing fine" and will be out of hospital soon||ORANGE, CALIFORNIA: Bill Clinton is doing fine and will be released soon from a Southern California hospital where he’s being treated for an infection, President Joe Biden said. Biden said Friday during remarks at the University of Connecticut that he had spoken to Clinton and the former president “sends his best.” “He’s doing fine; he really is,” Biden said. “He’s not in any serious condition,” Biden said. “He is getting out shortly, as I understand it. Whether that’s tomorrow or the next day, I don’t know.” Clinton, 75, was admitted to the University of California Irvine Medical Center, southeast of Los Angeles, on Tuesday with an infection unrelated to COVID-19, his spokesman said. An aide to the former president said Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, but he is on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition. Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said Friday that Clinton would remain hospitalized overnight to receive further intravenous antibiotics. “All health indicators are trending in the right direction, including his white blood count which has decreased significantly,” Ureña said in a statement. “President Clinton continues to be in excellent spirits, and is deeply grateful for the outstanding care he is receiving and the well wishes that people have sent from across America and around the world,” the statement said. The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn’t receiving ICU care. Clinton was reading books and watching TV coverage about his hospitalization, the aide said. Hillary Clinton was with him in the hospital, though not his daughter, Chelsea Clinton. In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery. He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health. Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, mostly notably his wife, Hillary, during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/former-us-president-bill-clinton-doing-fine-and-will-be-out-of-hospital-soon/articleshow/87055483.cms||---

While Anand Narasimhan (all-India 17), who also topped the state, said he hadn’t decided on the IIT he wants to join, Ashwin Abraham (all-India 18) is keen on opting for computer science at either IIT madras or IIT Bombay. Anand, who secured 320 of 360, said he was confident of getting high marks as he had done well in maths. Many had found the maths section lengthy and tough. Anand, who has been preparing for the past two years, said, “I want to study computer science. But, I have not decided about the IIT.” Practising past years’ papers, material given by his coaching institute and books recommended by teachers had helped, he said. “The online mode preparation was challenging, but I had more time as there was no travelling,” said Anand, who is also interested in coding, motorsports and cricket. Ashwin Abraham, who also scored 320 of 360 marks, said, “I practised many mock tests and my teachers helped me cope with online mode and to get high marks.” Playing cricket with friends and family members helped him cope with the pandemic, he said, adding that he prepared for around 10 hours a day for the exam. R Gokulakrishnan and Shankar Balajee, also from Chennai, ranked 140 and 152, while Harshitha Muthavarapu, who topped TN among girls, ranked 449 and may choose computer science in IIT Bombay or IIT Madras. “There was a huge difference in marks and ranks within top 1,000 ranks this year compared to 2020,” said B Pavan Kumar, deputy director of FIITJEE, Chennai. “The extra four months that students got after the exam was postponed due to Covid-19 second wave helped them prepare well.” Shilpa Hari, Chennai area general manager, Narayana Schools, said TN students did well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/two-chennai-students-among-top-20-in-jee-advanced-exam/articleshow/87055577.cms||---

Thanking the people for reposing faith in his government, Stalin urged the newly-elected representatives to sustain the goodwill of the people on the functioning of the state government. “The people have given the DMK and allies nearly 100% victory and rejected the opposition parties by not even giving them that status in most rural bodies. Given this scenario, we have to act responsibly and solve people’s problems without giving them room for complaints,” Stalin said in an open letter on Thursday. “In the wake of no credible opposition in the rural local bodies, one’s own conscience has to be considered as the opposition. This is not just a post, it is a responsibility and the elected representatives of the DMK and allies should remember this always,” he said. Attacking the AIADMK, whose decade-long rule resulted in the then ruling party exploiting the local bodies as a “source of corruption,” Stalin said only towards the end of the last term they opted to hold elections to rural local bodies (in 27 districts). Even that was done to retain their hold on those local bodies. “Even here, their attempts to browbeat the opposition failed, with the DMK and allies capturing over 50% of the posts. Still, the then ruling party tried to scuttle the functioning of such local bodies by depriving them of funds. Despite that, the hard work of the representatives helped them gain the confidence of the public and it reflected in the assembly election,” Stalin said. After coming to power and quickly completing the pending delimitation works in the nine newly-created districts, we have held the local body polls and people have given us almost 100% victory,” the chief minister said. “From 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the rural local body polls and the assembly elections, people have consistently backed the DMK alliance. I am confident that by acting responsibly, we will sweep the urban local body polls too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/consider-conscience-as-opposition-tamil-nadu-cm-m-k-stalin-tells-new-representatives/articleshow/87055742.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan sounds poll bugle, hoists Vijay Sankalp Dhwaj||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh sounded the bugle for upcoming bypolls in three assembly and one Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh by hoisting a “Vijay Sankalp Dhwaj” of BJP at village Sohawal under Raigaon assembly constituency in Satna district. Addressing a public meeting, Chouhan said he could not make any announcements for development of the area due to model code of conduct, but his visit to Sohawal will not have any meaning, if the face of the villages under Raigaon constituency don’t change after the election. The model code of conduct is for a few days and then he and his government would turn all stops to meet the aspirations of the people of the area, said Chouhan. Urging people to vote for BJP candidate from Raigaon, he said if BJP candidates win the election, he feels further strengthened and his resolve to serve the people also gets stronger. Chouhan said the Congress kept talking of the poor and the poverty eradication but didn't do anything towards that end. When the Congress came to power for 15 months after the previous assembly election, it stopped all welfare schemes started by his government, including Sambal Yojana, which was restored after he came back to power, the CM said. Chouhan said the BJP stands for everyone, all sections of the society, but its first priority is the welfare of the poor. The BJP is working with the objective of fulfiling the fundamental requirements of housing, education, health and employment of all the people. The CM said that when he came back to power, the Corona pandemic had already struck and in that situation, it was imperative to concentrate on fighting against the pandemic, but now his government is back on its agenda of housing for all, good education to children and proper healthcare to all. He referred to the CM Rise School scheme and Ayushman scheme in this context. While talking to reporters at Satna, Chouhan attacked his predecessor and state Congress chief Kamal Nath saying that he has nothing to do with development, or public welfare. Yet, he says that he has been an MP since the times BJP state president V D Sharma wore a knicker. “If someone who wore a knicker then is providing a capable leadership to the BJP, why should he feel bad?” asked the CM. Stating that Congress doesn't have any worthwhile issue to raise in the elections, Chouhan said Nath keeps making "nonsensical" allegations against him and his government. “He doesn't have to do anything but play twitter game,” Chouhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-sounds-poll-bugle-hoists-vijay-sankalp-dhwaj/articleshow/87055289.cms||---

The IMF in its report based on "consultations" among members, however, sounded a note of caution saying that the economic outlook remains "clouded" due to pandemic-related uncertainties, contributing to both downside and upside risks. In its "Article IV" consultations report, it further said that a persistent negative impact of Covid-19 on investment and other growth drivers could prolong the economic recovery. On the Indian government's handling of the pandemic, the multilateral agency said it was "swift and substantial...has included fiscal support, including scaled-up support to vulnerable groups, monetary policy easing, liquidity provision, and accommodative financial sector and regulatory policies". "Despite the pandemic, the authorities have continued to introduce structural reforms, including labour reforms and a privatisation plan," the report said. The IMF has projected India's economic growth at 9.5 per cent in FY2021-22 and 8.5 per cent in 2022-23. Headline inflation is projected at 5.6 per cent in 2021-22, amid elevated price pressures. "The economic outlook remains clouded due to pandemic-related uncertainties contributing to both downside and upside risks. A persistent negative impact of Covid-19 on investment, human capital, and other growth drivers could prolong the recovery and impact medium-term growth," the IMF said. It further said that while India benefits from favourable demographics, disruption to access to education and training due to the pandemic could weigh on improvements in human capital. At the same time, the recovery could also be faster than expected, it said adding that faster vaccination and better therapeutics could help contain the spread and limit the impact of the pandemic. In addition, successful implementation of the announced wide-ranging structural reforms could increase India's growth potential, the IMF noted. Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/imf-commends-indias-swift-substantial-response-to-pandemic/articleshow/87055420.cms||---

Police have arrested Manjunath Haslar on charges of murder. The twin murders came to light when his father Narayan returned home in the night to find his wife Parvathi, 42, and daughter Ramya, 19, in a pool of blood in their house in Kudegod village, Siddapur taluk. Sources said Manjunath, said to be an alcoholic, allegedly picked a fight with his mother over quality of sambar, saying the ingredients were raw. He opposed her plan to borrow money to buy a cellphone for Ramya, but she said she would still go ahead. The twin issues angered Manjunath, who shot his mother and sister with a country-made gun, which he had illegally procured to chase away wild animals in the family farm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-youth-kills-mother-sister-for-not-cooking-tasty-sambar-in-uttara-kannada/articleshow/87055859.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Guwahati sizzles at 37.7°C, much above normal October temperature||GUWAHATI: Guwahati reeled under sweltering heat this Durga Puja as the maximum temperature shot up to 37.7 degrees Celsius on Navami and Dashami, making both the days the hottest ever recorded in October, in Assam, the country’s meteorological department said on Friday. Met officials said that the city may experience light rainfall from Monday which may bring down the temperature. On Thursday and Friday, Guwahati recorded a maximum temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above normal., while the minimum temperature was logged at 25.1 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. “This is the highest maximum temperature ever recorded in the month of October in Guwahati. The previous record was 37.0 degrees Celsius on October 1 in 2009. The city may receive rainfall on Monday, but the dry weather may continue till the end of this month,” Sanjay O’Neill Shaw, deputy director general of meteorology, regional meteorological centre, Guwahati, said. While relative humidity, a measure of moisture in the air during the daytime, oscillated between 67% and 78%, the weather forecast stated that the maximum temperature was likely to be above normal by 4°C to 5°C across the northeast. Met officials attributed the “extreme weather” conditions and low rainfall to the presence of a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal. October has witnessed a deficiency of cumulative rainfall as only 69.2 mm of rain has been registered against the normal recording of 94.8 mm rainafall. “The rise in temperature is due to the presence of a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal. Whenever there is a low pressure in the bay, chances of precipitation in the region goes down. Due to the low pressure, there is less moisture which has resulted in this dry weather. Assam experienced a deficit of 22% rainfall during the monsoon,” RMC meteorologist Sunit Das said. The low pressure area lies over west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal, with the associated cyclonic circulation tilting southwest. Das said the “extreme weather” could not be linked directly with global warming or climate change. “We have to study the long series of temperature data to ascertain whether the temperature rise is linked with climate change,” the senior scientist said. The average maximum temperature in October between 1981-2010 was recorded 30.6 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/guwahati-sizzles-at-37-7c-much-above-normal-october-temp/articleshow/87049335.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

---||Guwahati||Assam: Immersion under Covid-19 shadow second year in a row||GUWAHATI: Durga Puja celebrations ended on a peaceful and joyful note on Friday in the city along with the rest of the state amid the shadow of coronavius for a second year in a row. The festival was celebrated in a befitting though muted manner after 18 months of strict restrictions in view of Covid-19 situation in the state. Over 300 Puja committees in the city immersed the idols of goddess Durga at seven designated immersion ghats in the city — Kachamari, Pandu, Saukuchi, Chunsali, Sonapur, Chandrapur and Azara — in the city of which Kachamari and Pandu are the biggest. The Kamrup (Metro) district administration allowed just five persons to immerse the idols at the ghats as a precautionary measure to avoid unnecessary gathering in view of Covid-19 protocols and unfortunate incidents at the ghats. Immersion of idols will continue in a few parts of the state on Saturday also. Harmeet Singh, commissioner of police, Guwahati, while inspecting the immersion at Kachamari Ghat, said, “Immersion is going well. Police, administration, NDRF and SDRF are making all efforts to maintain law and order, including ensuring smooth traffic movement.” He also said the district administration has taken all measures to combat plastic pollution according to the guidelines of the Pollution Control Board. City traffic police diverted the roads for the vehicles for two days — Friday and Saturday — for smooth traffic movement and immersion of the idols at the ghats. Meanwhile, the state excise department declared a dry day in Guwahati on Friday. All the bars and liquor shops remained closed across the city on Friday. Though the festival was celebrated, the lights and glitz were missing this time due to the Covid restrictions and the severe economic conditions after being hit by two brutal waves of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/immersion-under-covid-19-shadow-second-year-in-a-row/articleshow/87047136.cms||Mukut Das
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Sindoor Khela with Maa evoked mixed emotions||BHOPAL: After 10 days of enjoying the benign presence of Mother Goddess in their homes and several Pujo pandals, Bhopalis finally bid a tearful adieu to Maa on Friday. The Kali baris were again the hub of a lot of colourful rituals, with Sindoor Khela being the most favoured one on Bijoya (Dussehra) day. “Nine days of Navratri passed in a jiffy, although for us the main festivities began from the sixth day. So, when it was time for Maa to symbolically leave her mayka (parental home), we all felt the pain that one feels when a daughter of the family leaves to go to her husband’s home. But, before we allowed the tears to well in our eyes, we played a sindoor Holi with Maa. It is basically a symbol of happiness and marital bliss for all. Due to Covid fear, we used sanitiser and played Sindoor Khela only with our kin or closest friends and not with everyone, somethinb we did before Covid happened,” said Kesha Mitra, a homemaker. At several pujo pandals, including TT Nagar Kali Bari, public Sindoor Khela was not allowed, but that gave revellers another opportunity to play vermilion Holi with the Goddess. “When you are bidding farewell to Maa, you cherish each and every special moment that you can get with Her. I also smeared sindoor on Maa’s divine forehead and seeked Her blessings. The fact is that I’m already looking forward to her comeback next year and hopefully without Covid fear looming large on our heads,” said Sharmishtha Das, an educationist. There were others who enjoyed this part of the celebration for the first time and captured those moments forever, not only in their smartphones, but also in their hearts. A newly married girl, Ankita Gupta Ghosh, was on top of the world as she said, “This was my first sindoor khela as I have just got married to Shirish - a Bengali. This particular part of pujo was really awe-inspiring for me. After the khela, we all looked like human Goddesses, who have to carry on Her mission of empowerment on this earth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-sindoor-khela-with-maa-evoked-mixed-emotions/articleshow/87056126.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

The quake hit just before dawn, causing people to run outdoors in a panic. It struck just as the island is beginning to reopen to tourism as the pandemic wanes. The US Geological Survey said the magnitude 4.8 quake was centred 62 km (38.5 miles) northeast of Singaraja, a Bali port town. Its shallow depth of 10 km (6.2 miles) may have amplified the amount of damage. A magnitude 4.3 aftershock followed. That quake was relatively deep, at 282 km (174 miles). Gede Darmada, head of the island's Search and Rescue Agency, said the agency was still collecting updates on damage and casualties. He said the injuries included broken bones and head wounds. The earthquake triggered landslides in a hilly district, killing at least two people and cutting off access to at least three villages, Darmada said. It toppled homes and temples in Karangasem, the area closest to the epicenter, killing a 3-year-old girl who was hit by falling debris, he said. Houses and government facilities were damaged in Trunyan and in Kintamani villages, a popular sightseeing destination with a stunning lake. Known as the “island of the gods,” Bali is home to more than 4 million mostly Hindu people in the mainly Muslim nation. It is famed for its temples, scenic volcanos and beautiful white-sand beaches. On Thursday the island reopened to international travellers for the first time in more than a year after Indonesia's COVID-19 caseload declined considerably. The country has had around 1,000 cases a day in the past week after peaking at around 56,000 daily new cases in July. Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 270 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines that arcs the Pacific. The last major earthquake was in January when a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500. More than 92,000 people were displaced after it struck Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi province.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/moderate-earthquake-rocks-bali-killing-at-least-3/articleshow/87055494.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||How to hush the Ahmedabad’s screams?||AHMEDABAD: In a city like Ahmedabad, there is an omnipresent din — from vehicles, construction work, or a raucous event at a party plot. This soundscape is hellish for anyone trying to read in peace, or attempting to talk over the phone, or making desperate efforts to sleep. Most of us think that the fury of a city’s screams is the nature of the urban beast and we get used to it. But a team of researchers has found in its socio-acoustics survey that the city noise is affecting people to such an extent that some are willing to pay for mitigation. A comprehensive study to quantify noise annoyance levels in the city was carried out by researchers from Indus University, Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), and Gujarat Power Engineering and Research Institute. The study surveyed close to 400 individuals in the city to gauge how they were affected by the noise levels. TimesViewThere is a growing body of evidence today to prove that noise affects our productivity. A municipal corporation like Ahmedabad can help mitigate this by implementing zoning controls and other land use policies to limit or avoid proximity to noisy spots. Other measures could include enforcing noise standards for loud machinery and equipment and even restrict their use, depending on location or timing to protect health and sleep of its citizens. Local regulations can restrict holding of loud events, designate no-honking zones, regulate the use of back-up beepers and implement rules to control the speed of vehicles on certain streets in the city. I is time that Amdavadis take a critical look at invisible noise pollution and take measures to curb it for the welfare of everyone in the city.The survey revealed that only 14% of the people were reluctant to pay for measures to attenuate the noise pollution. The remaining 86% fell into two categories — “willing” (40%) and “not sure” (46%). “There is a growing body of evidence that noise is more than nuisance. Persistent exposure to noise can cause chronic health issues,” said Dr Anurag Kandya, associate professor from PDEU. “Marginalized communities get affected the most as they often live close to the sources of unwanted noise.” The field investigation had revealed that the sound levels reached as high as 83 decibels (dB). The background noise ranged between 65 dB and 75 dB, equivalent to hearing a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner constantly. While throwing light on the noisescape of the city, the study revealed that the most dominant noise pollution ranged between 72 dB and 73 dB which covers 23% of the total investigated area of 101 sq km. Then came the 73-74 dB range, blasting 20% of the investigated area. About 14% of the investigated area had average sound levels above 77 dB. In all, the study had revealed that in 88% of the 123 locations surveyed, noise levels hit the 69-80 dB range, way higher than the acceptable levels of 45-55 dB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/how-to-hush-the-ahmedabads-screams/articleshow/87056526.cms||Paul John
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government proposes to cut financial benefits in agro-business policy||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government will shortly announce its new agro-business policy for the period of 2021-2026 to give a boost to the employment-generating sector. While the government has proposed to reduce key financial benefits being offered in the current policy (2016 to 2021), agro-business industries will be able to enjoy dual benefits from Centre and state policies for the sector. Chief minister Bhupendra Patel and agriculture minister Raghavji Patel are expected to formally announce the policy in the coming few days. Sources said the policy is expected to generate an output of Rs 9,000 crore over the next five years. Key sources close to the development said, “In the upcoming new agro-business policy of the state agriculture and farmer welfare department, financial benefits will be available for investments of up to 35 lakh. This amount was Rs 50 lakh in the earlier policy. Also, in the new policy, interest subsidy will be 7% instead of 7.5% as per the earlier policy.” Sources added that although the financial benefits have been reduced in the proposed policy, it is expected that considering higher demand, more number of applications will be admitted and more industries will be given benefits. In the proposed policy, most of the obligations on the side of industries like minimum 85% local employment will be required to get benefits under the policy. “Under the proposed new policy, the most significant feature will be that industries will be allowed to avail dual benefits of policies offered by the government of India and government of Gujarat. Under the present policy, benefits can be availed under any one policy only. This policy change is expected to attract more industries to state,’’ added the sources. The source further said, “At present, units registered under the agro-business policy generate output of around Rs 1,200 crore per annum. Under the proposed policy, it is expected to cross Rs1,800 crore value every year and over Rs 9,000 crore during the five-year policy term. In next five years, the state government aims to give maximum benefits to organic agro product-based industries in the state which will generate more value for the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-government-proposes-to-cut-financial-benefits-in-agro-business-policy/articleshow/87056590.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Surat||Surat: Got chance to lead sans political, dynastic backing, says PM Narendra Modi||SURAT: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he was given the opportunity to serve as chief minister of Gujarat and then as Prime Minister of the country even though he had no political or dynastic background, or a caste support. Modi was speaking after laying the foundation stone virtually for a boys' hostel on the outskirts of Surat, being constructed by the Saurashtra Patel Seva Samaj, a trust working for the welfare of the Patidar community. “I was a common man who did not have any political or dynastic background and no support of caste-based politics. Despite that, your blessings gave me the opportunity to serve Gujarat way back in 2001,” he said. “And, such is the power of your blessings that even after 20 years, I am still serving. First I served the people of Gujarat and now I am serving the country,” the prime minister added. He urged people to walk on the path shown by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “Sardar Patel had said that we should not let castes and religious faith become a hindrance for us. We are all sons and daughters of India and we all should love our country. We all should love each other. People of Gujarat always believed in strengthening Sardar Patel's teachings. `Nation First' is the motto of Sardar Patel's children,” Modi said. The prime minister also recalled the contribution of several prominent reformers and educationists from Gujarat, including Chaganbha of north Gujarat and Bhai Kaka of the Charotar region. He also spoke about Sankalchand Patel, Ganpat Patel, Mohan Lalji Patel and Karshan Virani. He gave the credit to some of the initiatives started during his tenure as chief minister for improvement on the education front and a dip in the school drop-out ratio among girl students. “There was a time when Gujarat did not have good quality schools and teachers. With the blessings of Maa Umiya and Maa Khodal (deities of the Patidar community), we included people in the movement and launched initiatives like Praveshotsav and Gunotsav,” Modi said. As lack of toilets at schools was leading to girls dropping out, these facilities were provided and as a result the number of girls leaving schools midway significantly decreased, he said. Modi also lauded the new Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel, saying though he speaks less, one can not find any flaw in his work. Patel has been in public life for over 25 years and had started out as a councillor of a municipality, the prime minister noted. In the first phase of the project undertaken by the Saurashtra Patel Seva Samaj near Valak village, a hostel for 1,000 male students of the Patidar community will be built. In the second phase, another hostel having the capacity to accommodate 500 girl students will be constructed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-got-chance-to-lead-sans-political-dynastic-backing-says-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/87056644.cms||---
