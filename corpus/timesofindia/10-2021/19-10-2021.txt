You stated, ‘When sentiments are hurt, it is natural that there are actions and reactions. Even the youth should keep in mind these sentiments and act accordingly. This is a societal question. Society needs morality. Can we live without morality? No, we cannot. Relationships and peace are maintained by this morality.’ You also stated that moral policing is a ‘sensitive issue’, and just as the government has to maintain law and order, society too must behave in a ‘responsible way’, and ‘people have to behave appropriately to avoid incidents’,” the notice sent by Maitreyi Krishnan, co-convener of AILAJ reads.Citing the dictum of the Supreme Court in Tehseen Poonawalla vs Union of India and others and Shakti Vahini v. Union of India cases, the AILAJ has demanded that the government protect inter-caste and inter-faith marriages and publicise the steps that have been taken to combat violence, honour killings and ‘moral policing’ against such persons and ensure that action will be taken to prevent and punish crimes in the name of religion and caste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lawyers-seek-withdrawal-of-cm-remark-on-moral-policing/articleshow/87119408.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Bypoll campaign hots up post Dasara; BS Yediyurappa in Hangal today||BENGALURU/HAVERI: Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa will start campaigning from Tuesday in the two bypoll segments of Hangal and Sindgi. He, however, will be campaigning alone and not with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. “I’ll campaign for two days each in Hangal and Sindgi. If there is a need, or demand from the party, then I will canvass for one more day in each segment closer to elections. Our intent is to win both the bypolls,” Yediyurappa said. When asked whether he would join Bommai, he said it’s not logical. “I will be going alone and the CM will do the same on his own. There is no gain with both of us campaigning together. If we campaign separately then we cover more ground and have better reach,” he said. The BJP has doubled its efforts with more ministers heading towards the two constituencies. On Monday, health minister K Sudhakar, labour minister Shivram Hebbar and agriculture minister BC Patil canvassed in Hangal for party candidate Shivraj Sajjanar. However, the absence of industries minister Murugesh Nirani, who is attending the Dubai expo 2020 along with several other ministers, is being felt on the ground. “Some ministers are avoiding the campaign at Hangal despite the party asking them to take charge of Maha Shakti Kendras. However, they are yet to communicate with us for their participation,” claimed a local leader. At Hangal, Sudhakar targeted the Congress, saying it had grabbed power from former minister Manohar Tehsildar when he was the excise minister, despite him belonging to the backward class. “This is a serious threat to the backward classes by the Congress,” he alleged. Hitting back, Congress state president DK Shivakumar said the BJP has “use and throw” attitude towards senior functionaries and cited the example of late CM Udasi, who was not inducted into the ministry in the 2019 Yediyurappa government. ‘BJP lacks leadership’ Earlier in the day, in Sindgi, opposition leader Siddaramaiah accused the BJP of having no leadership in the state unit after it sidelined Yediyurappa. “The party has nothing to show as its achievements or work. It is presently running only in the name of Prime Minister Modi,” he said, during a public event campaigning for party candidate Ashok Manguli. Siddaramaiah claimed citizens are being misled in the name of Modi, while all the schemes which are providing relief to the people of the country were launched by former PM Manmohan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bypoll-campaign-hots-up-post-dasara-bsy-in-hangal-today/articleshow/87119414.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Jog Falls in Shivamogga will get Rs 185-crore facelift; viewing deck added attraction||BENGALURU: The state government has mooted another grand plan to develop the iconic Jog Falls in Shivamogga into an international tourism destination, at a cost of Rs 185 crore. The pet project of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who hails from the district, will be completed in 18 months, excluding the monsoon season (June to October), officials said. In 2015, the Congress government had decided to privatise the tourist hotspot to Abu Dhabi-based NRI BR Shetty, who had planned to invest Rs 450 crore and turn it into a perennial waterfall. But Shetty dropped the project after he suffered huge financial losses. Awarded to Shankaranarayana Constructions (SNC), a private firm, the project will bring about a drastic change in the look of Jog Falls, from its entrance to a three-tier viewing deck and from demolishing the existing KSTDC hotel to creating a souvenir shop, a science museum, Sharavathi statue and a swimming pool overseeing it. However, some green activists and forest officials have raised concerns. The project may damage the ecological sensitivity of the area, a section of the officials said. “The Rs 185-crore proposal will turn Jog Falls into a commercial hub and result in the destruction of the pristine beauty,” said an official. The biggest “sore thumb”, which may stick out on project completion, will be the three-tier view deck. While the base deck will have a semi-open seating area and a viewing area, apart from public restrooms, the second tier will have a retail store, a cafeteria, common-seating area and a food and beverage store. The third tier will have an open bar, close restaurant, a food kiosk and indoor seating overlooking the falls. As per the tender document, the government also intends to demolish the existing shopping complexes, KSTDC-owned Mayura cafeteria, and the existing view point. Besides a souvenir shop, the project will also see the construction of a large parking bay, a transit hub and public restroom. The KPCL has also proposed massive landscaping with a gazebo, a statue of Goddess Sharavathi in the middle and a pathway connecting the landscaping with the viewing deck. However, Pankaj Kumar Pandey, tourism secretary and coordinator for the Jog Development Authority, said the government is quite aware of ensuring that the pristineness of Jog Falls is not destroyed. “As per the initial plans, we’re going to ensure the viewing deck is constructed from below ground level and not at an elevated position overlooking the falls,” he said. According to Pandey, the proposal also entails battery operated vehicles being set up to take people from the base parking to the top. While the funds for developing the project were provided to the tourism department, the implementing agency chosen was KPCL as it had the technical and engineering knowledge and had its own base at Jog Falls. Energy minister V Sunil Kumar was caught unaware of the project being executed by KPCL.  “We do not have any funds per say for the project and are not implementing such a tourism project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/jog-falls-will-get-185-cr-facelift-viewing-deck-added-attraction/articleshow/87119416.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt not to privatise MySugar factory||BENGALURU/MANDYA: Following pressure from farmers and legislators of Mandya district, the Karnataka government on Monday decided against privatization of the loss-making MySugar factory. After a meeting with stakeholders, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai announced that the government will make efforts to revive the Mandya factory by modernizing its units and upgrading machinery. He said the government will set up an expert committee to look into the company’s requirements, including working capital, to run the factory. The CM said he has directed officials to prepare a detailed plan to restart the factory and crush sugarcane in the upcoming season. “We’ve decided to not privatise or lease the factory. We will, instead, revive the company by appointing a bureaucrat as its managing director. If needed, we’ll rope in an industry expert to seek suggestions,” he said. The CM said the government will ask the accountant general’s office to study the factory books. Then Mysore maharaja, Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, started Mysore Sugar Company Ltd (MySugar) in Pandavapura taluk of Mandya in 1933. The factory has been reporting huge losses for over two decades due to alleged mismanagement before it was shut down a few years ago. Agitation called offThe government’s decision to privatize the factory had run into a controversy as Nirani Sugars, owned by state industries minister Murugesh R Nirani, had offered to take control of the shut factory. However, in the recent monsoon session of the legislative assembly, Nirani announced he would not participate in the bids to take over the factory. Former CM HD Kumaraswamy, local legislators and farmers had opposed the move. Mandya Zilla Raita Hitarakshana Samiti led by Sunanda Jayaram had launched an indefinite agitation, which was called off after the CM’s announcement on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-not-to-privatise-mysugar-factory/articleshow/87119518.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Hospital staffers on police radar after nurse ends life in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The mother of a 24-year-old nurse, who committed suicide, has alleged that doctors and a male nurse of a private hospital in Devanahalli, north Bengaluru, abetted her daughter into taking the extreme step. Shwetanjali Naik, who was from Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, lived with her colleagues in the official quarters of the hospital located in the same building. Shwetanjali died on August 29 after injecting herself with poison on August 3. Acting on a complaint filed by Shwetanjali’s mother Kantamma Naik, police have booked staff nurse identified as Girish and unidentified doctors under IPC section 306 for abetment to suicide. “We have questioned some doctors and hospital staff. But prime suspect Girish is missing and, hence, no arrests have been made so far,” an investigating officer said. On August 3, Shwetanjali allegedly injected herself with poison inside her room. She was treated at the ICU of the same hospital and Kantamma was informed about it. Police said that they did not come across any suicide note at the place of incident. “I arrived at the hospital around 3pm the same day. Doctors treating Shwetanjali asked me to shift her to a better hospital Accordingly, I shifted her to another hospital in Hebbal the same night. But I was unable to bear the expenses and, therefore, shifted Shwetanjali to a government hospital in Anantapur on August 21. Shwetanjali died on August 29,” Kantamma stated in her complaint. Last week, Kantamma, with the help of a relative, unlocked Shwetanjali’s mobile phone and was shocked to see pictures of her and Girish. “Girish had taken pictures of Shwetanjali while sleeping on the bed. Also, there were pictures of the two when they had gone out. These pictures made me suspect that Girish and doctors at the same hospital had something to do with Shwetanjali’s death,” Kantamma’s complaint read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hospital-staffers-on-police-radar-after-nurse-ends-life/articleshow/87119570.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Ex-min’s plea against CBI probe dismissed||Bengaluru: The high court has rejected the petitions of former Congress minister Vinay Kulkarni and other accused in connection with the Dharwad zilla panchayat member Yogishgouda Goudar murder case.Besides Vinay Kulkarni, who is arraigned as accused No 15, Basavaraj Shivappa Muttagi (main accused); Vinayak (6th accused); Chandrashekar (16th accused) and Somashekar (21st accused) had challenged the September 6, 2019 order passed by the government granting sanction to the CBI to probe the case and the FIR registered on September 24, 2019. A division bench comprising Justices B Veerappa and NS Sanjay Gowda pointed out that if a prima facie case is made out, disclosing the ingredients of the offences as alleged against the accused, the court cannot quash the criminal proceedings.The bench also noted in the present case, the trial is half way through as chargesheets have been filed by impleading the new accused persons, cognizance of the offences has been already taken by the competent court and the matter is now being posted for further trial. “Therefore, this court cannot quash the impugned order passed by the government, the FIR culminating in the filing of supplementary chargesheets and taking of cognizance by the competent court and that too when the matter is now being posted for further trial,” the bench added.The bench said the material on record depicts that the local investigating officers had not conducted a fair and proper investigation and some of the accused were shielded. The subsequent supplementary chargesheets filed illustrates that the investigating officers – accused No.19 and 20 — colluded with the accused to dilute the investigation in return for gratification and there is abundant material on record about the overt acts committed by the accused. “The accused have to face the trial. They have not made out a case as to how they are prejudiced by facing trial,” the bench added. Yogishgouda, a BJP member, was allegedly murdered on June 15, 2016 in Dharwad. The matter was handed over to CBI on September 6, 2019 by the state government, following a representation submitted by the brother of Yogishgouda, alleging tainted investigation, threats to witnesses from police officers, political interference among others. Kulkarni was taken into custody in November last year. CBI claimed that Kulkarni, who was the district minister, did not want Yogishgouda to grow as a big leader in Dharwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ex-mins-plea-against-cbi-probe-dismissed/articleshow/87119595.cms||---

The case relates to a phone conversation between Bhaskar Rao, former city police commissioner and current ADGP, railways, and a private individual in August 2019. A recording of the conversation was allegedly leaked by another senior IPS officer soon after Rao became city police commissioner. Rao filed a criminal complaint against the officer, saying his phone had been tapped. In September 2019, the newly formed BJP government led by BS Yediyurappa had requested the central government to transfer the case to the CBI for investigation.On August 30 this year, the CBI filed a ‘B’ report saying there was no evidence to pursue the case. Rao had filed a ‘protest petition’ saying there was much to investigate. On Monday, the CBI court observed: “The B report submitted by CBI is hereby dismissed. Further, the CBI officer is directed to conduct further investigation and submit a proper report. Hence, direction to CBI in this regard.” Rao said: “My fight for justice will continue. In my protest petition I had questioned how the investigation agency can file a ‘B’ report when there was so much to investigate. Let the truth prevail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bhaskar-rao-phone-tapping-court-rejects-b-report/articleshow/87119607.cms||---

KSRTC does not collect fares for children up to six years and those below 12 are charged half the fare. Cash-strapped KSRTC has now decided to charge the full fare from children below 12 years who are more than 130cm tall unless they provide age proof like birth certificate, school ID or Aadhaar. Earlier, KSRTC conductors considered height as the yardstick. “Now, we will not measure height if age proof is furnished,” said a senior KSRTC official. Officials said many passengers and conductors often get into arguments over half tickets of children. “In many instances, some parents lie about the actual age of their children and claim half the ticket. It’s also difficult for the conductors to assess the age of children” said an official. He said they have put up markings in all buses for conductors to check the height of children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/half-ticket-for-children-ksrtc-wants-age-proof/articleshow/87119653.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The CM was accompanied by BBMP and BWSSB officials as he went around HSR Layout, Madiwala, Silk Board and Hosur Road, among other areas.Bommai commenced the inspection from Agara Lake, where he noticed that the stormwater drain was carrying rainwater along with sewage. The CM also noticed that the lake’s outlets of were jammed due to which water overflowed, leaving many homes inundated. He immediately directed Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner of BBMP, to discuss with the stormwater drain department and address the issue. Variation in the level of underground drainage pipelines is the primary cause of inundation and needs rectification, he said. During an interaction with residents of HSR Layout, Bommai blamed lack of proper town planning for flooding across the city. “We are interfering with water level and lakes in the city. When towns are built on lakes, flooding is natural. Since towns are already built, it is important to safeguard our citizens and the government will address this,” he said.Residents said their numerous complaints over the blocked main drain have been ignored by officials. Bommai told them that he will look into the issue. “The capacity of the stormwater drain is 35 MLD, but only 25 MLD is being processed. Sewage treatment plants need to be fixed immediately,” he added.The CM noticed that both water and sewage lines were getting mixed, creating problems. “A separate drain should be constructed for localities surrounding Agara Lake,” he said. He also asked the SWD engineers to raise the height of the retaining walls along stormwater drains and desilt and deepen them to increase their water-holding capacity.“I have informed BBMP and BWSSB to clear the drains right away and within 4-5 months the works will be completed,” he said, adding: “By summer of 2022, works need to be completed so that rain next year doesn’t cause any damage to residential areas.”He also informed BBMP and BWSSB to work in coordination and address citizen grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-directs-civic-bodies-to-fix-drains-to-check-flooding/articleshow/87119667.cms||---

Signs of ‘parking full’ went up in some places, even as long lines at trial rooms and billing counters brought in a welcome change after more than 18 pandemic-weary months. Netizens were quick to notice the rush and take to social media platforms to share their experiences and observe that popular eateries were full to the brim with people. Twitter user ‘Bangalore Metro Updates’ tweeted: “V R Mall at 4.30 PM - Parking Full, no entry; Phoenix Mall - Parking Full, No Entry; HSR Layout 27th Main - packed with Cars on both sides and Pani Puri guys are super busy serving customers. Four clear signs of China Virus disappearing!? Fair to say that?? Or is it too early! (sic)” Another user Dinesh responded: “Waited for an hour to get parking but no luck. Went back home without visiting the mall.” Richa C, a make-up artist out for Diwali shopping, told TOI that she spent an hour in a line at a trial room, and almost double the time to bill the items. “I can’t complain to see normalcy returning. The festive vibes were obvious and I hope this continues,” she said. While some felt this was a positive sign, others feared the laxity might lead to an increase in Covid cases again. Sethu Ram, a techie, said it is positive to see crowded shopping malls. “However, this must not lead to another wave,” he added. Manoj Singh, cluster director, Karnataka Malls at Nexus Malls (the Forum Mall Koramangala, Forum Neighbourhood Mall and Forum Shantiniketan in Whitefield) said they witnessed a 50% growth in the footfalls and double the sales compared to last year. “However, our pre-Covid footfall recovery is still only at 60%,” he said. Sunil Munshi, AVP Operations, Orion Malls, Brigade Group, said over the last week, they saw a footfall of over 3.2 lakhs across all three Orion Malls in the city -- Orion Mall at Brigade Gateway, Orion Avenue at Cooke Town and Orion Uptown at Whitefield-Hoskote. “We are at over 75% of pre-pandemic footfall and expect to surpass that by Diwali,” he said. Shibu Philips, Business Head, Lulu Malls, said they witnessed a footfall of over 1.6 lakh between Thursday and Sunday. Philips said to ensure smooth traffic flow at the mall, entry to the mall will only be from the Magadi Road side, while the Vatal Nagaraj Road one will be used only for the exit. “We have been holding several meetings with traffic officials to determine alternative and viable options for entry and exit. Also, direct access from Rajajinagar to the mall will be opened in the next two weeks,” he said. MLA Suresh Kumar had tweeted that the mall caused traffic congestion on Vatal Nagaraj Road. “Studied the issue with Traffic Police team for over an hour The Entrance & Exit system needs to be streamlined. Extra load adds to the worry (sic),” he tweeted. Eateries filledChef Vikas Seth, culinary director, Embassy Leisure (Sanchez, Sriracha and Hopshaus), said they saw a 10-15% increase in their sales during the weekend. They expect a higher footfall when the rain recedes and the 10pm curfew is relaxed. Zonu Reddy, Partner Spago Foods, Magnolia Bakery India, said there was a good rise in the enquiries and online orders for the festive hampers. Aditi Rao, co-founder, K-OS Game Bar – Koramangala, said the last weekend was a celebration at the outlet filled with ‘We-fies’.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Malleswaram’s popular eatery dons bigger, better look||BENGALURU: Malleswaram’s famous eatery, Veena Stores, on Margosa Road got a fresh look and a bigger dining space much to the delight of a loyal clientele. Started in 1977 by Suryanarayana, the eatery was named Veena Stores and started serving tiffin items, including idli, vada and kesari bath. Just a 150-sq ft eatery turned into a sensation, with hundreds queuing up daily without worrying about the stand-and-dine system. Foodies not just from Malleswaram but from other parts of Bengaluru too thronged this tiny eatery for the tasty tiffin items. But the Covid crisis came as a blow, forcing it to down shutters for a few months starting July 2020. “We had to close it for a few months; it was the first such long break since the time we started in 1977. But we managed to bounce back as the situation eased, thanks to the love and support of our customers,” said Pradeep Suryanarayana, owner of Veena Stores and son of Suryanarayana, who is now 84 and retired. Not only did this favourite foodies’ den bounce back from the pandemic crisis, but it also came back with a refurbished look — catchy nameboard and bigger and better dinning area. “On Vijayadashami, we had the opening of our outlet with additional space. Earlier, we were only a 150-sq ft place, but now we have expanded to 600-sq ft. We have added three more adjacent spaces...,” added Pradeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/popular-eatery-dons-bigger-better-look/articleshow/87119765.cms||---

This includes 78.1 per cent in urban and 75.1 per cent in rural areas. In the first round of sero survey, the positivity rate was found to be 8 per cent and in the second round of sero survey it was 14.8 per cent. Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij released the survey report and lauded the efforts of medicos, para medicos and administrative staff in conducting the survey.

According to information, the children below the age of 10 and between the age of 10 and 18 years too are found to be sero positive and the report suggested less impact in Haryana in terms of anticipated third wave in the state. "Even as report clearly suggests so but even then we are prepared for any kind of situation, especially when it comes to impact on children,'' said Vij. According to a report, a positivity of 75.3 per cent was found among men and 77.1 per cent was found among women. Also, 69.8 per cent children fall in the age group of 6 to 9 years, and 73.2 per cent of children in 10 to 17 years .

This serves a two-fold purpose for Pakistan’s ISI: attracting the Kashmiri population towards terrorism and driving out migrant workers and residual minority community members from the valley, a top intelligence officer said. Targeted violence of this nature would also affect Kashmir’s tourism industry. "The law and order incident-free situation after the abrogation of the special status of J&K was alarmed the ISI and they tried various means to create trouble in the valley," the officer said. The killing of pharmacy owner M L Bindroo in Srinagar’s main market at Huzuri Bagh and a Muslim man at Batamallo on October 2 attracted media attention across the country. "This gave Pakistan the idea of fomenting communal clashes in the region," the intelligence officer said. Eleven people, including five Muslims, have been killed by terrorists in the last fortnight. The latest attack was on three Bihari labourers at their rented accommodation in Kulgam on Sunday evening. The killing of eight Indian soldiers in an encounter with terrorists is an indication of the Pakistan army’s role from across the LoC in Poonch sector in helping the terrorists sneak into J&K, the intelligence officer added. He said this gunfight between the infiltrators and Indian soldiers has been ongoing for one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-revives-strategy-of-killing-minority-members-in-kashmir/articleshow/87120268.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: 3 cops suspended after detainee runs away from police barrack||BHUBANESWAR: Three police personnel from Balangir were suspended on Monday after one Govinda Sahu, president of Sunshine English Medium School in Kalahandi district, escaped from Titilagarh police barrack on Sunday night. The suspended constables are Jaya Jani and Rabindra J from Odisha Auxiliary Police Force (OAPF) and one Rakesh Biswal from Balangir police. Sahu was detained by Balangir police in connection with a teacher going missing from her school 11 days ago. The issue kicked up a controversy with BJP and Congress alleging the involvement of minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra in the case. Leader of opposition Pradipta Kumar Naik said the minister’s name is surfacing in the case. “As Govinda Sahu is an influential person and is known to Mishra, we cannot expect a fair probe into the matter. That’s why we demand a CBI probe,” he added. Naik said Mishra should resign from his post on moral grounds. “If the minister’s name is surfacing in the case, he should not continue as a minister,” said the BJP leader. Even Kalahandi MP Basant Panda raised the same demand. Congress also demanded his resignation citing his alleged involvement in the case. Mishra said law will take its own course. “We have full faith in the system. Anybody found guilty in the case will be booked under law,” he added. Police have started a search operation to nab Sahu. Family members of the teacher lodged an FIR with Balangir police citing the alleged involvement of Sahu in her disappearance. Later police detained the school president for interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/3-cops-suspended-after-detainee-runs-away-from-police-barrack/articleshow/87121390.cms||Hemanta Pradhan
---||Bhubaneswar||Steep veggie prices singe kitchens||BHUBANESWAR: Prolonged rain and frequent hike in petrol costs have led to a steep rise in vegetable prices, causing endless miseries to poor and middle-class families. Not only is no vegetable available in the markets for less than Rs 50 per kg at present, kitchen essentials like tomato and onion are being sold at Rs 70 and Rs 50 respectively, in the capital. With the festive season and the holy month of Kartika on, the inflation has disturbed the household budgets. “Unlike the regular pre-winter months, veggies in reduced quantities are coming to the market this time. Incessant rain over the past few months damaged a huge amount of crops. Due to transportation charges, import from other states has also gone down significantly, leading to a demand-supply gap,” said Kartika Sahu, a vegetable vendor at the Unit-1 market here. The supply of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, French beans, carrot, radish and capsicum that are usually available in plenty in October remains restricted across markets in Bhubaneswar. “It is October, but still we couldn’t buy quality cauliflower yet. The ones being sold at Rs 60 per piece are small in size and rot very quickly. Similarly, the price of French beans is Rs 120 per kg, while coriander is Rs 300 per kg. I don’t know how to manage the kitchen as the vegetables are getting pricey with each day,” said Meerambika Rath, a homemaker. Vendors who sell veggies on carts in different localities are charging even more than the market prices besides selling every item in small quantities, alleged customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/steep-veggie-prices-singe-kitchens/articleshow/87120437.cms||Minati Singha

Teachers have been asked to conduct remedial classes and engage students in extra-curricular activities to help them overcome the fear and anxiety of classroom learning amid the pandemic. Since these students have not attended any offline classes in standard VII, and may have little idea about the lessons they finished in Class VI, an assessment on each subject will be done following the re-opening, a government notification said. “On the first two days, various extra-curricular activities will be conducted. The assessment of one subject per day will begin on October 27,” the notification added. Assessment sheets will be provided by the Odisha School Education Project Authority and the State Council of Educational Research and Training. The school headmaster will distribute photocopies of the assessment sheets among students. The assessment sheets of students, who don’t come to school yet, will be sent to their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-issues-guidelines-for-resumption-of-offline-classes/articleshow/87120617.cms||Minati Singha

They are driven by fear after hearing of non-locals being targeted by terrorists, the latest attack being on three labourers from Bihar in Kulgam, south Kashmir, on Sunday evening. Two terrorists had killed two Bihari labourers and injured a third in their rented accommodation in Kulgam, an atrocity claimed by the United Liberation Front, a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Mukesh Sah, who returned to Bihar’s Banka district with the body of Arvind Kumar Sah on Sunday, claimed the militants fired at Bihari workers in Kashmir after asking for their Aadhar cards to ensure that they were non-Kashmiris. Read AlsoTerrorists kill 2 non-Kashmiris in J&amp;K, Army toll in Jammu gunfight rises to 9A non-local vendor was shot dead in the Eidgah area of old Srinagar city on Saturday evening. He has been identified as Arvind Kumar, a street-food seller from Bihar. In Pulwama, a carpenter from Saharanpur, UP was shot dead by terrorists. He was identified as Sageer Ahmad and used to work at aOver 200 migrant workers from Narpatganj, Raniganj, Forbesganj and Jokihat Palasi blocks in Bihar's Araria district alone are set to leave for home due to pressure from family members to return. Many are learnt to have already boarded trains for their hometowns. Mohammed Akram, a migrant labourer from Bihar, was waiting near the tourist reception centre in Srinagar to take the morning bus to Jammu because he was feeling insecure. The heavy overnight rain had not deterred him. "I did not feel the cold of Kashmir, fear forced me to stay in the open to catch the first bus to Jammu to save my life," Akram said, adding, "It’s better to go back to Bihar." In Patna, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that the J&K administration must act swiftly and "also provide necessary protection in the areas where workers from other states reside". He said they must take the steps necessary "to ensure that such targeted attacks on non-locals do not recur in the Kashmir valley". Nitish said he had expressed his concern at the "targeted killings" to J&K L-G Manoj Sinha over the phone. "I told Sinha that the people of Bihar are concerned about the recurrent killings of our people. Sinha assured me that he was looking into the matter," Nitish said. "But it is a fact that something wrong is happening in the valley. Some people are deliberately attacking those who had gone there for work. The way two labourers from Bihar were selectively killed after entering their house… We have alerted the J&K administration," he said, adding, "We are deeply hurt by the killings." Ghulam Hassan, the owner of an orchard in Shopian, said, "I had engaged 10 Bihari labourers to pluck apples from the trees but I preferred to send them to their homes in Bihar rather than see them getting killed by terrorists." "The situation is very bad in Kashmir these days. It was not so bad about six months ago when we reached here in search of a livelihood," said Gautam Rishidev (32), who stays in Lara Ganjipora area of Kulgam district. Rishidev belongs to Narpatganj block in Araria district and worked as a labourer in a private building construction company. He is part of a 20-member group of migrant workers from Araria. Manzar Alam, a migrant worker from Saharsa district currently staying in Leh, said he has asked the labour contractor to clear his dues as he has to leave Kashmir for his hometown as early as possible. Ashish Bhagat, a sitting panchayat samiti member of Mirzapur panchayat in Bihar, told TOI people were praying for the safe return of their relatives from J&K. Chunchun Rishidev, a resident of Ward 10 of Mirzapur panchayat, is battling for life after being shot and injured by terrorists in Kulgam on Sunday evening. Trucks from outside the state were seen huddled together on the main roads in parts of south Kashmir; the drivers felt safer on the main roads rather than in the remote villages where they were supposed load their trucks with apples. Many fruit growers have dumped their apples in cold storage in Pulwama and Shopian as non-local buyers, too, have fled the Valley "Now we have to travel to their business places outside J&K to sell our produce," said Mohammad Ajaz , an orchard owner from Shopian. Officials in the Jharkhand chief minister’s office said they were prepared to bring back from Kashmir labourers from Jharkhand if they were facing danger. "We have not received any SOS message from the Jharkhand labourers in Kashmir yet, though reports of migrant labourers from other states being targeted have reached us," said Abhishek Choubey, an officer who looks after migrant labourers’ issues at the CMO. He said the state was ready to undertake a rescue operation if the need arose. Nitish said Sunday’s incident was the third in which people from Bihar had been killed in J&K. Four people from Bihar have so far been killed in targeted attacks in J&K in the last two weeks. On Saturday, Arvind Kumar Sah, a "panipuri" seller from Bihar’s Banka district, was killed in a terrorist attack in Srinagar. On October 5, one Birendra Paswan from Bhagalpur district was shot dead by terrorists in Srinagar. And on Sunday two labourers from Araria were killed and a third was critically injured in Kulgam district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fear-drives-exodus-of-bihar-labourers-from-kashmir/articleshow/87120706.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The Indian company on Sunday won the prize in the "Clean Our Air" category for its technology to create fuel, fertiliser and other speciality chemicals from agricultural waste. Takachar's innovation aims to put an end to stubble burning, an annual scourge in north India that causes severe air pollution, including in National Capital Region. The technology will also raise farmers' income by creating a market for crop residues. Takachar’s cheap, small-scale, portable technology can attach to tractors in remote farms and converts crop residues into sellable profitable bio-products, reducing smoke emissions by up to 98%. Besides £1 million in prize money, the firm will receive support from some of the world’s most influential companies to scale and grow. Takachar hopes to expand its operations around the world with a goal to cut a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Takachar co-founder and CEO Vidyut Mohan said, "In some parts of the world, air pollution reduces life expectancy of the population by up to nine years. All of us need to stop ignoring this problem, and act now. This award will enable us to scale our solution worldwide and help us realise our vision of reducing air pollution while creating livelihood opportunities for rural communities." An array of stars and performers attended the "green-carpet" awards ceremony held at Alexander Palace, dressed in recycled clothes. Actress Emma Watson wore wedding attire made from 10 dresses that came from a second-hand shop. Sponsors of the prizes include the Aga Khan Development Network, Bezos Earth Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies. Jason Knauf, CEO of the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, said, "The burning of agricultural waste is one of the biggest drivers of city air pollution, but it doesn’t get the global attention the issue needs. Takachar’s game-changing solution presents a way to not only eradicate the air pollution that would otherwise be created by burning, but to do so profitably in a way that benefits farmers. They have shown great leadership in one of the areas worst-hit by air pollution, which we hope will inspire others. Takachar has shown that India’s innovators have what it takes to solve India’s environmental challenges." Every year, till 2030, £1 million each will go to five selected projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-firm-wins-prince-williams-1mn-prize-for-clean-air-tech/articleshow/87120800.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The rainfall may also lead to rise in water level in the Burhabalang and Subarnarekha rivers. The latest forecast came at a time when some northern Odisha pockets are witnessing heavy to extremely heavy rain over the past 24 hours. The IMD's rainfall report recorded on Monday morning said Jaleswar in Balasore district received the state’s highest rainfall of 217mm during the period. Following incessant rain in the upper catchment area of the Jalaka, the river was flowing above the danger mark at Mathani in Balasore district on Monday, triggering flood threat in the region. The water level stood at 6.02 metre against the danger level of 5.50 metres. Several panchayats of Basta and Sadar blocks are likely to be affected if the water level continues to rise. The IMD forecast also said that intensity of rain due to the low pressure’s influence will decrease gradually from Wednesday, and the state will witness a complete dry weather from Friday onwards, with the chances of a little drop in the night temperature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/met-eyes-widespread-rain-in-northern-pockets-of-state/articleshow/87121389.cms||---

The government needs to circumvent what it has described as the challenge of efficient logistics to be able to despatch any food aid to Afghanistan though. India wants unhindered and direct access for those handling humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and believes only the UN is equipped to monitor, as foreign minister S Jaishankar said last month in a UN address, a non-discriminatory distribution of humanitarian assistance across all sections of the Afghan society. Indian aid will depend on whether or not this ``enabling environment'' is created. The UN World Food Programme had said earlier this month that it was in touch with Indian authorities for procurement of wheat from India for Afghanistan. India had last year delivered 75,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan but that was through the long and circuitous Chabahar port route. One of the options being considered is to transport wheat to Afghanistan by road via the Attari-Wagah border with Pakistan but that will be a complicated exercise given that Pakistan doesn’t allow 2-way trade for India and Afghanistan through that border. It only allows Afghanistan to export goods to India. India though is learnt to be in touch with Pakistan on this issue. For any such proposal to materialise, UN will have an important role to play in the logistics. In his G20 address last week, PM Narendra Modi had also called for unhindered and urgent humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people. India has also said that, irrespective of India’s relations with the Taliban, its traditionally friendly ties with the Afghan people will continue to guide its approach to Afghanistan. Humanitarian assistance, including food aid, will be a major focus area for the international conference India has proposed to organise next month in Delhi and for which it has invited Russia, China and Pakistan, among others. TOI had first reported on Saturday that India had proposed the conference on Afghanistan. India remains a major source of wheat for Afghanistan, having already supplied more than a million metric tonnes of the grain in the past 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/afghanistan-in-food-crisis-india-plans-to-send-50000mt-of-wheat/articleshow/87121362.cms||Sachin Parashar

The final match resulted in a draw between the two teams. Despite the bad weather, Sharmila Tagore, the patron for the Bhopal Pataudi Cup, came to the event to award the two teams and keep up the family tradition. She interacted briefly with the players and told them, “I can see a lot of young players and I hope I get to see all of you play next time. I would have really liked to say well played, well done, congratulations while giving out these trophies, but I don’t know what to say now!” Missing out on the game because of the weather was a let down for the veteran actress too. “It is so sad that it had to rain. Initially I had hoped it would rain only for a few minutes, but god had other plans. It poured so much that the ground was unplayable,” she said, adding, “I love the game. My husband, of course, used to like it very much. It’s very fast and if you don’t follow the rules, players can get hurt as there have been lot of accidents too.I am so glad that the Army, royals and also some business houses are now supporting the game. It had disappeared at one point, but now it is popular again and I can see lot of people coming to watch it.” The actress added that coming to Jaipur Polo Grounds always makes her nostalgic and there are many memories attached to the ground and the game. “My father-in-law passed away while playing polo, he had a massive heart attack, I wasn’t there then. Lot of my mother-in-law’s friends have played the game,” she said. Attending the Bhopal Pataudi Cup has always been a family tradition for the actress. This year, only she could come for the event and Saif Ali Khan missed attending it due to his shooting schedule.

It added that “before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective”. The statements came a day after WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the UN agency’s technical advisory group (TAG) would meet on October 26 to consider EUL for Covaxin. WHO said while Covaxin’s manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, has been submitting data on a rolling basis and its experts have reviewed this data, it is “expecting one additional piece of information from the company today”. However, neither WHO nor Bharat Biotech specified what information has been sought. WHO had stated on October 5, after its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts held a meeting on Covaxin’s EUL application, that the WHO and an independent group of experts were “scheduled to meet next week to carry out the risk/benefit assessment and come to a final decision whether to grant EUL to Covaxin” after the company had submitted additional information on September 27. On Monday, WHO said: “The timeframe for the WHO EUL procedure is dependent on how quickly a company producing the vaccine is able to provide the data required for WHO to evaluate the vaccine’s quality, safety, efficacy and its suitability for low- and middle-income countries.” “When the information provided addresses all questions raised, WHO and the technical advisory group will complete the assessment and come to a final recommendation,” WHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/need-more-info-cant-cut-corners-on-covaxin-who/articleshow/87121566.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Nearly half of these candidates will take the first part of their final exams in their own school, the Board announced on Monday. The exams for minor subjects will begin on November 16 and for the major subjects on November 30 as per the datesheet announced by CBSE on Monday. This is the first time that CBSE will be conducting the Board exams in two phases — Term 1 and 2. The Board has also increased the number of exam centres from 7,000 to 14,000. While around 22 lakh candidates are expected to take the OMR-based Term 1 MCQ exam for Class X, nearly 14 lakh have registered for the Term 1 of Class XII. Exams for several subjects for the 2020 Board exams were not held while the 2021 exams for both classes could not be conducted at all because of the pandemic. Thereafter, in keeping with the provisions of the National Education Policy-2020, the Board decided to conduct exams in two phases – Term 1 (which is MCQ-based 90-minute test) and Term 2 (which will be 120-minute subjective test). Both the terms will have practical exams. However, Term 1 practicals will be conducted by the schools. According to Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations, CBSE, the Board has made elaborate arrangements for the conduct of the Term 1 exams amid fears of a Covid-19 third wave. “All the schools will be sanitised and only 12 students will be seated in each room to maintain social distancing,” he said. The Class XII Term 1 exams for major subjects will commence with sociology on December 1. Class X major subject exams will commence with social science on November 30. The Board has also made special provision for students with disabilities, which include separate seating arrangements. “Separate rooms will be provided to such candidates. They will also be given assistance by the centres as per CBSE directives and rights of the PwDs to make the exams barrier-free,” added Bhardwaj. On doubling the number of exam centres, Bhardwaj said: “This is being done to ensure that students are either appearing in an exam centre close to their school and wherever this is not possible, candidates will be allowed to write the exam in their own school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/36-lakh-highest-ever-to-take-cbse-boards-from-nov-16/articleshow/87121809.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

SKM had given a call to disrupt rail traffic from 10am to 4pm, demanding the immediate arrest and dismissal of junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra from the Cabinet over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Railway ministry sources said services were hit at nearly 184 locations across the three states and also Rajasthan, and running of nearly 210 trains hindered across seven zones, including in the northeast and western India. North zone hit hard, 42 trains cancelled The maximum impact was in the north zone, which was the epicentre of the six-hour long protest. According to sources, as many as 42 trains, including many short distance trains, had to be cancelled and 30 of these had to be cancelled in areas under northern Railways alone. Out of the total 50 trains that were partially cancelled across the seven zones, 31 were from northern Railways. Farmers obstructed the Amritsar-Delhi rail track at Devidaspura near Amritsar. In Tarn Taran, farmers led by United Kisan Morcha convener Mukhtar Singh Malla and Amritpal Singh Joda sat on the rail track. At many places like Ferozepur, protesters began gathering near railway tracks as early as 5am. The protesting farmers made elaborate arrangements of ‘langar’ for passengers at railway stations. In Haryana’s Rohtak, protesters on railway tracks at Rohtak junction, Lakhan Majra, Lahali, Makdoli and Rohad, waved BKU flags and raised slogans against the government. Officials said four trains, including the Chandigarh-New Delhi Shatabdi, were fully cancelled while 14 mail and express trains were halted in Ambala. Farmers squatted on railway tracks in several districts of west UP and Terai region in Uttarakhand, delaying trains for hours and leaving passengers stranded on the stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rail-roko-stir-halts-210-trains-north-india-hit-hardest/articleshow/87122104.cms||---

Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on CovidWhile the country is about to touch the 100-crore vaccination milestone this week, Arora ruled out any shortage of vaccines. He said the country would have about 90 crore doses available for the programme in the coming three months. “More vaccines will be added shortly to the present range available in the country,” he said. “Covid vaccines are very effective in preventing serious disease for the current variants. They are likely to be effective on future variants as well.” Virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, a member of the Covid-19 working group and a professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, expressed her discontent over not enough data being available on the current vaccines’ effectiveness on variants. “Without data, it is very difficult to know how our vaccines are working against variants or to think about what needs to be done for boosters,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-new-covid-variant-of-concern-in-last-6-months-arora/articleshow/87122328.cms||Nisha Nambiar

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra quoted reports that Tariq Hameed Karra, a Kashmiri leader and a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee, had credited Jawaharlal Nehru for J&K’s integration with India and alleged that Patel wanted to keep the Valley out. “What sort of mindset is this that one family has done everything and others have done nothing. What CWC has done is a sin,” he said. He noted that Karra also batted for Rahul Gandhi to take over as Congress chief while lauding the contribution of the Nehru-Gandhi family and criticising Patel. He asked whether Rahul or Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had objected when Karra “vilified” Patel and presented India’s first home minister as a “villain” while praising Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-slams-cong-for-patels-vilification/articleshow/87122641.cms||---

Two trains, including a goods train, were detained at the Bhubaneswar station by protestors for around 30 minutes. The Bhubaneswar-Secunderabad Special was detained at the Berhampur station for around 50 minutes by around 200 agitators . The rail roko was staged at Cuttack, Bhadrak, Balasore, Paralakhemundi, Talcher, Paradip, Keonjhar, Sambalpur and Rourkela stations too. Though the farmer leaders had called for rail roko for six hours, the trains were detained for an average 30 minutes. Long-distance trains like Konark Express Special was running an hour late while filing of the report, the Amritsar-Visakhapatnam Special was two hours behind schedule and trains from North India were also running late. “I came to Bhubaneswar for a cousin’s engagement. But the train got delayed by more than two hours due to protests at some stations on the way to my destination,” said Maninder from Amritsar. Suresh Panigrahy from SKM said they organised the rail roko peacefully at different railway stations in the state. Congress along with Left parties extended their support to the agitation. Pradesh Kisan Congress president Amiya Kumar Patnaik said the Centre should not suppress the voice of farmers by using pressure tactics. “We demand withdrawal of the draconian farm laws,” Patnaik added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/rail-roko-by-farmers-delays-trains/articleshow/87131543.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

It (Congress) had even rolled out a scheme for adult education. Modi didn’t learn there either. Those who chose to beg for a living are pushing the people of the country to beggary. Country is suffering because of #angootha-chhap Modi,” the official Twitter handle of Karnataka Congress tweeted. In a series of tweets, Congress also held Modi responsible for the problems the country is facing on the economic front. It also dared the PM for a public debate with party member Rahul Gandhi. Karnataka BJP, in what appeared to be an attack on Rahul without taking his name, said: “Though there were enough schools, a 50-year-old and a youth leader didn’t study in India at all. Though there was an adult education programme, Pappu did not grow mentally.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-takes-illiterate-jibe-at-pm-bjp-targets-rahul/articleshow/87122775.cms||---

The cranking up of combat capabilities and infrastructure along the 1,346-km border that Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim share with China’s Tibet Autonomous Region has gained utmost urgency ever since the military confrontation erupted in the western sector of eastern Ladakh in April-May last year. Day and night surveillance capabilities have witnessed a major upgrade, with feeds from satellites, a wide array of radars and Israeli Heron Mark-II drones being sent to integrated surveillance and communication hubs to keep tabs on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) across the border. Read AlsoIndia military accelerates historic overhaul to counter ChinaThe military reorganization would create at least four theater commands: One in the west looking at Pakistan, another in the east focused on China, a maritime command for the Indian Ocean region and an air defense command, the officials said.“There has been a major concerted push to use technology, with fusion of air and ground-based surveillance assets, to bring in transparency. He (China) cannot surprise us. We are very confident about dealing with the overall scenario,” said Major General Zubin A Minwalla, the general officer commanding of the 5 Mountain Division. At his headquarters at Rupa, the Corps Airspace Control Centre works in close conjunction with the IAF to get a “complete air picture” along the LAC, while the Surveillance Centre tracks PLA movements and infrastructure deep inside their territory. The latter, in fact, even has an artificial intelligence (AI)-based face recognition software to identify PLA officers. Similarly, there is a “tremendous” drive to upgrade infrastructure, whether it be the Border Roads Organisation or the state government. “The most important infrastructure in the mountains is a road network,” said Maj Gen Minwalla, who also oversees the military preparedness in the critical Tawang region. Massive infrastructure construction is taking place in the region, including a new alternative western road axis to Tawang as well as tunnels and forward operating bases for Army Aviation, among other things. There are, of course, still many operational gaps along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, with last-mile connectivity especially being a major problem for Indian soldiers in many stretches from the west to the east. India, however, has significantly strengthened its combat punch along the northern borders. “The focus is on upgrading offensive and defensive capabilities, backed by the ongoing enhancement in surveillance and infrastructure,” said a senior officer. It is quite evident in the entire eastern sector. The measures range from the basing of the second Rafale fighter squadron in Hasimara close to the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, which add to the Sukhoi-30MKI jets already deployed at air bases like Tezpur and Chabua, and to Akash surface-to-air missile systems and the old but still reliable 105mm artillery field guns and Bofors howitzers. The induction of the new M-777 ultra-light howitzers, with a strike range of 30-km, has also boosted the high-volume artillery firepower, especially as they can be swiftly airlifted from one valley to another by Chinook helicopters in Arunachal Pradesh.

At present, commercial establishments have to down shutters by 10pm. Now timings for restaurants in Mumbai are likely to be extended up to 1am and for shops up to 12 midnight. The decision was taken in a meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Covid task force. The extended timings for shops, restaurants and bars were announced later by the state administration on Thackeray’s instructions. With the festive season on, the retail sector has been demanding an extension in timings to boost footfall and cut losses incurred during the lockdown. Restaurateurs happy with move to extend working hours to 1amLast week, at a meeting of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) ministers with party president Sharad Pawar, a demand was raised to give relief to the business community by allowing them to operate longer hours. Amusement parks have also been allowed to resume activities from October 22, which coincides with reopening of theatres, auditoriums and multiplexes. But the government has specified that its nod is only for rides that are dry and not water rides or water parks; a decision on the latter category will be taken later. Detailed guidelines for these will also be issued and it is likely they will be restricted at 50% capacity, said officials. The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday said they will follow guidelines issued by the state government while allowing reopening of cinemas, drama theatres and cultural programmes in Mumbai from October 22. Mumbai island city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said timings for restaurants will be restored to pre-Covid days, that is till 1.30am by the end of the week. All other conditions remain the same, including a 50% occupancy limit. Health minister Rajesh Tope said shop timings will be extended till midnight at least in Mumbai and restaurants will be allowed to take their last orders till 1am. “For the rest of the state, local bodies can decide on keeping Mumbai timings as the base,” said Tope. The hospitality industry has unanimously welcomed the move. HRAWI senior vice president Pradeep Shetty said the association had petitioned the government repeatedly on the issue of timings. “Since Mumbai is the most restricted region in the whole country, we are very pleased to know that the chief minister has taken such a positive stand on it,” said Shetty. AHAR president Shivanand Shetty said, “Restoring city restaurant timings to pre-Covid days is a very positive step and we welco me it. The move will enhance the festive spirit and mood of the industry. We expect the final copy of the order for implementation on the new timings soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-govt-extends-timings-for-shops-and-restaurants/articleshow/87123599.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s built-up area doubled in 27 years, 81% open land lost: Study||MUMBAI: The city’s built-up area doubled between 1991 and 2018, indicating frenzied construction activity, according to a study by some researchers. In 1991, the built-up area covered roughly 173 sq km; but by 2018, it increased to 346 sq km. Changing land use patterns and urban heat island effect created has led to a 2 degree Celsius increase in average temperatures during this period. The study, done using satellite imagery, found Mumbai lost 81% of its open land (barren spaces without vegetation), 40% green cover (forests and scrublands) and approximately 30% of its water bodies (lakes, ponds and floodplains). The researchers were from Faculty of Natural Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, Osmania University in Hyderabad and Aligarh Muslim University. The study, Urban Heat Island Dynamics in Response to Land-Use/Land-Cover Change in the Coastal City of Mumbai, was published in the peer-reviewed Springer Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing. At this pace of urbanisation and landscape transformation, it is expected that the urban heat island effect will intensify further in the city. ‘Urban heat island’ effect a threat to our healthShahfahad, senior research fellow at Department of Geography, Jamia Millia Islamia University and lead author of the study, said, “We found that rapid uncontrolled urbanisation over the past five to six decades attracted a large population by providing better economic opportunities. As a result, natural land use patterns such as vegetation cover, scrublands, wetlands, and open lands have been transformed on a large scale into the city’s built-up surfaces.” The study used satellite imagery (USA-NASA Landsat datasets freely available) and the authors studied 603 sq km of Mumbai region (city and suburbs) to understand landuse and land-cover changes, difference in maximum, minimum and average temperatures (for urban heat island intensity), land surface temperatures, changes in vegetation cover versus urban built-up density between 1991 and 2018. The findings were represented in the form of high resolution maps and attempted to enhance urban planning and policy decisions by mitigating the Urban Heat Island effect. The extreme heat that one experiences when strolling through any urban landscape is caused by the Urban Heat Island effect, a micro-climatic phenomenon. This is due to a number of causes, the most prominent being the usage of materials such as concrete, explained Prof Atiqur Rahman from Department of Geography, Faculty of Natural Sciences Jamia Millia Islamia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/citys-built-up-area-doubled-in-27-yrs-81-open-land-lost-study/articleshow/87123626.cms||---

The boy also led the police to the recovery of the “murder weapons” — a 5kg dumbbell and a knife allegedly used in the crime and a towel used for cleaning the bloodstains — from a well near their house on Monday afternoon after a hectic search conducted with the help of the fire brigade. “We produced the teenager before a child welfare committee which ordered his remand in a correctional facility,” deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Deepak Girhe said. City police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said, “Despite all the limitations, technical hurdles and absence of eyewitnesses, our police teams have finally detected the case.” The professor was found murdered on October 11 morning. His family members, including parents, wife, daughter and son, had claimed they had no idea how and when the murder had happened. The son had said he had seen someone running away from the house during the early hours. The police said the boy cracked under intense questioning and admitted to the crime. A senior officer associated with the investigation said the boy has claimed that he was upset with his father’s insulting behaviour towards him over the years. Minor son has confessed to killing professor dad: PoliceThe investigators were intrigued by the fact that no one was spotted going in or out of the house during the intervening night, that there was no sign of forced entry, there were no fingerprints of an outsider and nothing was stolen from the bungalow. Preliminary investigation revealed that the boy, driven by a desire to eliminate his father, had been watching murder mystery movies and web series on OTT platforms for well over a year, police said. The boy has also confessed that he watched videos on how to slit a throat and murder a person, his legal rights as a juvenile as well as protection under law, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minor-son-detained-has-confessed-to-killing-professor-dad-aurangabad-cops/articleshow/87123675.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||World||Gunmen kill 43 in Nigeria's troubled north||ABUJA: Gunmen from a suspected criminal gang attacked a village market in northwest Nigeria's Sokoto state, killing 43 people, the state government said Monday. Heavily armed gangs known locally as bandits have terrorised northwest and central Nigeria for years, raiding and looting villages, but attacks have become even more violent in recent months. "Forty-three people have been confirmed dead following the attack by bandits in Goronyo village" on Sunday, Sokoto government spokesman Muhammad Bello said in a statement. "It was a market day and there were many traders," Bello told AFP by phone. Police spokesman Sanusi Abubakar also confirmed that bandits attacked Goronyo late on Sunday. "Our security operatives are there to conduct investigations," Abubakar added, without giving details. Phone networks in the area have been suspended for weeks to disrupt the gangs' operations, making information-gathering difficult. A gang raided another village market on October 8, in Sabon Birni district near the border with Niger, killing 19 people. Since last month, Nigerian troops have been conducting air and ground operations against bandit camps in neighbouring Zamfara state. Telecom services were also shut down in Zamfara, and parts of Kaduna and Katsina states. Officials in Sokoto are worried that bandits are relocating to the state as a result of operations in Zamfara. "We're faced and bedevilled by many security challenges in our own area here, particularly banditry, kidnapping and other associated crimes," wrote Bello, on behalf of the state governor. Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal had requested "the presence of more forces in the state and the deployment of more resources", he added. Last month 17 Nigerian security personnel were killed when gunmen attacked their base in Sabon Birni, an assault the military blamed on Islamic State-aligned jihadists. Although the bandits have no known ideological agenda, concerns have grown of jihadist inroads in the region. Violence has spiralled in recent months across the northwest, forcing thousands of already vulnerable people to flee their homes, a situation aid agencies fear risks becoming a humanitarian crisis. Since January 2020, about 50,000 people fled from their homes in the northwest alone, according to the International Organization for Migration. More than 80,000 additional people have fled to neighbouring Niger over the past two years. Increasingly, bandits have turned to mass kidnapping and have taken hundreds of schoolchildren since December. Most have been freed or released after ransom but dozens are still being held. The violence is just one challenge facing Nigeria's security forces. They are also battling a 12-year jihadist insurgency in the northeast that has killed more than 40,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/gunmen-kill-43-in-nigerias-troubled-north/articleshow/87123716.cms||---

People protesting against the campaign called it “de-Hinduising Deepawali”. With the #BoycottFabIndia hashtag trending on Twitter, the IPO-bound company was forced to take down some of its tweets promoting the collection. When contacted by TOI, however, a Fabindia spokesperson said the collection titled ‘Jashn-e-Riwaaz’ is not its Diwali collection. “Our Diwali collection, called “Jhilmil si Diwali” is yet to be launched,” she said. “We at Fabindia have always stood for celebration of India with its myriad traditions in all hues. In fact ‘Fabindia – Celebrate India’ is our tagline and also a wordmark. Our current capsule of products under the name Jashn-e-Riwaaz is a celebration of Indian traditions. The phrase means that, literally.” The New Delhi-headquartered company is not the first one to face backlash on social media for its campaign or collection. Tata’s jewellery brand Tanishq drew the ire of a section of social media when it launched an ad that promoted inter-faith marriage. With netizens slamming the viral ad, #boycottTanishq started trending on social media. Similarly, a recent ad by clothing brand Manyaavar featuring Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt ran into a social roadblock. Tyre maker Ceat’s recent commercial featuring Aamir Khan urging people to refrain from burning crackers, too, landed in controversy. “Trolls, competitor-encouraged bots, sensitive people, hyper-sensitive people, hurt-people and all kinds of robots and human beings reside in this space we call social-media! And they intermingle undistinguished. Anyone who has been observing the trends on a hyper-sensitive social media would not have attempted this for sure, ” said brand expert Harish Bijoor, who runs boutique consulting outfit Bijoor Consults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fabindia-collection-sparks-row-online/articleshow/87123777.cms||John Sarkar

The meeting was attended by police heads of all states and Union Territories as well as chiefs of various central armed police forces (CAPFs). The meeting — part of the bi-annual review taken by the home minister with the police heads — deliberated on various internal security challenges and discussed ways to counter them firmly and effectively. The conference, held via hybrid mode with participants attending physically as well as virtually, is being seen as a precursor to the annual DGP/IGP conference to be organised by the Intelligence Bureau soon, which will also be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The home ministry in a tweet said the deliberations at Monday’s conference were “detailed and expansive, given the presence of all DGPs and DGs of CAPFs”. Sources added that a comprehensive follow-up on decisions of the last DGP/IGP conference as well as progress on implementation of directions given by the PM was taken. Also, issues to be taken up at the next DGP/IGP conference were discussed. Home ministry sources said the national security strategies conference on Monday saw the police chiefs put together a brief on their assessment of the security situation, while focusing on specific issues and challenges like the killing of non-locals and minorities in J&K, radicalisation in the wake of Taliban takeover in Afghanistan and IS recruits from India being freed from prisons in Afghanistan, Left-wing extremism and new-age crimes. The J&K DGP is said to have briefed the conference on the security situation following the targeted attacks on civilians, particularly minorities and non-locals in the valley, and measures being taken to protect them. The conference was also apprised of the ongoing crackdown on terrorists and overground workers (OGWs) in J&K, including those directly involved in the recent civilian killings. Shah is due to travel to J&K from October 23 to 25 and will take a detailed review of the security situation there, during which future strategies will be deliberated upon by him along with the police, Army and intelligence brass. Monday’s conference was organised by the Intelligence Bureau and attended by junior home minister Nityanand Rai, NSA Ajit Doval, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and Director of Intelligence Bureau Arvind Kumar. Shah also laid a wreath at the IB headquarters as a tribute to police martyrs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-reviews-internal-security-discusses-jk-targeted-killings-with-police-brass/articleshow/87123802.cms||Bharti Jain

The self-proclaimed “godman”, who was convicted along with the co-accused on October 8, is already serving 20 years in jail since 2017 for the rape of two sadhvis and life imprisonment for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatarpati. Special public prosecutor H P S Verma said the court also slapped a fine of Rs 31 lakh on the Dera chief, Rs 1.5 lakh on fellow convict Sabdil Singh, Rs 1.25 lakh each on Jasbir Singh and Krishan Lal, and Rs 75,000 on Avtar Singh. CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg ordered that 50% of these amounts be given to the victim’s family, he said. Ram Rahim might have been convicted and jailed for two rape and as many murder cases, but he still would not be considered a “hardcore criminal” for the purpose of temporary release from jail on parole or furlough. Based on the Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 1988, he remains fully eligible for parole or furlough, except in the event of an adverse report from the district magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dera-chief-gets-life-for-ex-managers-murder/articleshow/87123821.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Jaishankar was more explicit. In his post-meeting remarks, he said, “Starting the negotiating process, talks will start in November and they are very confident that they would be able to conclude the negotiations by next June. So it's something that we very much look forward to.” India and Israel will host a joint “Women and STEM mini conference on November 24, where women scientists from both sides participate.” Jaishankar held a meeting with the business groups and CEOs where he said, India regards Israel “in many ways as perhaps our most trusted and innovative partner.” “The degree of trust between us is very high,” Jaishankar said. Welcoming Israeli business into India after the latest round of reforms, Jaishankar even lauded the farm laws (which have become controversial in India due to sustained protests by some farmers), saying they make agriculture much more sustainable which actually creates the basis for greater businesses in agriculture and greater employment in agriculture. “We certainly think those changes would encourage much more investment into agriculture and food production.” “India is a very welcoming place for business. Not just business, we would like to see more partnerships. And both of our societies recognise that our strength lies in the quality of our people,” Jaishankar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-and-israel-agree-on-vax-cert-recognition-fta-talks/articleshow/87123851.cms||---

The doctors refused to hand over the body, claiming the deceased was Covid-positive. However, results from an antigen test and RT-PCR tests, conducted just a day before her death, all stated Covid-negative. Ashwini Thavai (36) was about six weeks pregnant when she was advised to abort on medical grounds. She was prescribed an abortion pill but it resulted in an incomplete termination of pregnancy. On May 1, she underwent surgery after assurances from the doctors that they had all medical facilities. However, due to excessive bleeding, her condition became critical. The doctors then said she would need a ventilator bed, which they didn’t have. She was then shifted to another hospital. She died 45 minutes later. While the post-mortem report states that the victim died to incomplete abortion, it also states that the victim was Covid-positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/doctors-botch-abortion-try-to-show-fatality-as-covid-death-booked/articleshow/87123874.cms||Umesh K Parida

The accused was living with the family for over eight years and the minor’s father had died four years before the alleged incident. The accused claimed that he was falsely implicated as the women did not like the fact that he was strict and enforced discipline in the household. Acquitting him, the court said the minor’s account of rape with respect to day, date and time of the incidents, was vague. “In the background of contradictions and improvement in the prosecution evidence… oral evidence of prosecution witness (PW) one (minor) and two (mother) does not inspire confidence. Delay of one year and four months in approaching police after the incident of rape also affects the credibility of evidence of PW one and two,” the court said. While the alleged incidents of rape took place in 2017 when the mother was away, the FIR was registered in 2018. The minor claimed that the accused had threatened her and that initially her mother did not believe her. However, the court said that it appeared strange that after serious incidents of rape, the girl remained silent due to fear of accused but after the incidents of inappropriate touch she disclosed the facts to her mother who immediately approached the police. “In the background of this fact also evidence of PW one and two appears unbelievable,” the court said. The court further said that it was not proved that the girl was a minor. The court said, “As per victim’s evidence it appears that incident of rape occurred in day time, then question arises as to how she was present in the house when she was doing a job. Considering these aspects, the prosecution should have brought on record exact date and time of incidents of rape,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-3-yrs-in-jail-man-cleared-in-rape-case-by-pocso-court/articleshow/87123902.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The cabinet also announced a fixed monthly water user charge of Rs 50 across rural and urban parts of the state. Addressing the media after a cabinet meeting here, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said, “We will now charge the minimum rate of user charges of Rs 50. There are outsta-nding bills in cities amounting to Rs 700 crore which we will waive.” According to a spokesperson, the decision would entail an annual expenditure of Rs 440 crore on the state exchequer and benefit domestic connections of all categories having plot size above 125 square yards in municipal councils/nagar panchayats and municipal corporations. Plots up to 125 square yards in urban areas have already been exempted from paying water and sewerage user charges. Both these concessions would benefit nearly 25 lakh families in urban areas. CM Channi said it was the opposition’s propaganda that the Punjab government coffers were empty. “The exchequer will never be empty. We will give the right amenities to people – power, water and sewerage at affordable rates,” he said. The cabinet also decided to provide free power to all rural water supply schemes from October 1, 2021. It also decided to provide funds through budgetary support to settle outstanding arrears of Rs 1,168 crore. Besides, the Punjab cabinet also decided to waive all outstanding arrears of water supply and sewerage charges for domestic connections. This decision is likely to cost the state exchequer nearly Rs 700 crore. The state cabinet also decided to send recommendations for appointment of Jagbans Singh as new chairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/power-water-sops-in-poll-bound-punjab/articleshow/87123942.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi breathes year’s cleanest air, first ever ‘good air’ day recorded in October||NEW DELHI: Monday’s heavy overnight rain achieved what this year’s monsoon couldn’t — produce a “good air” day for Delhiites, the first in 2021, and the first in October since the air quality index began in 2015. The city’s average AQI on Monday was 46, entering the “good” zone (below 50) for the first time in 14 months. The improvement in air quality in a span of 24 hours couldn’t have been more dramatic. On Sunday, Delhi’s AQI had hovered close to the “very poor” category (above 300) at 298, with a toxic haze enveloping the city the day before. As air quality usually starts falling from mid-October, experts said a clean air day during this time was highly “unusual”. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board, which started measuring AQI from 2015, shows good air days are rare in Delhi. Not a single such day was reported in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Rarer still are good air days outside the monsoon season, with just one recorded since 2015, prior to Monday. In 2017, there were two “good air” days, on July 30 and 31. Two days were reported in 2019 as well — August 18 and 19. Last year, Delhi saw five good air quality days — one in March following the total Covid lockdown and four in August. V K Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “Good rainfall recorded in Delhi and neighbouring states, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Uttarakhand, helped wash out pollutants, pushing the city’s AQI in the ‘good’ category.” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “A good air day in October is unusual due to the onset of winter conditions that trap pollution. A good air day (based on AQI) is elusive in the capital and a few that occur happen largely during monsoon period.” She added, “This October, however, delayed and intense rains in the region have washed out pollutants. But pollution will bounce back soon. We need to be prepared.” System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the good category with PM2.5 as the main pollutant. Local land surfaces are wet and so dust re-suspension is minimum which led to low PM10. Presence of western disturbance has led to scattered rainfall over north India, leading to low biomass burning. This condition improved AQI with low PM2.5. Fire counts have reduced to 170 and its share is only 1% to PM2.5.” Experts warned that the air quality is likely to deteriorate in the next two days. SAFAR said, “Moist surfaces inhibit re-suspension of dust which will keep AQI in ‘good’ category for the next 24 hours. After that, AQI will degrade to ‘satisfactory’ for Delhi.” L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said, “In the coming weeks, with changes in meteorological conditions, emissions from local and regional sources would only cause deterioration in air quality. The Delhi government should roll out pre-emptive measures in advance to keep the capital's air quality levels under check.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-breathes-years-cleanest-air-1st-ever-good-air-day-recorded-in-oct/articleshow/87123478.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

In the most severe rain-related mishap on Monday, three people – 2 women and a child — from Nepal were killed in Pauri district following a landslide in Lansdowne at the site of an under-construction hotel, according to the State Emergency Operation Centre. The deceased have been identified as Samuna (50), Sapna (40) and Abisa (4). In another incident in Rudraprayag district, a 27-year-old man from Kanpur, Sudhir Awasthi, died after being hit by a boulder near Sangam market in Rudraprayag. Two deaths were reported from Champawat district where a 48-year-old woman and her 17-year-old son were buried alive in their home after a landslide. Meanwhile, Nainital was cut off from the rest of the state on Monday after landslides blocked all three highways to the hill town, leaving many tourists stranded on the roads and in hotels. According to the district administration, many people travelling to and from Nainital were stranded for several hours on the routes. Hordes of tourists had reached Nainital over the Dussehra long weekend and many have been left stranded. The torrential rains also resulted in an abrupt rise in water level at the Naini Lake on Monday. Gangotri and Yamunotri national highways and several other ancillary roads in Garhwal and Kumaon also remained blocked on Monday due to landslides. All trekking activities and the Char Dham yatra remained suspended. Due to prediction of heavy to very heavy rainfall over next 48 hours, the state government had from Sunday onwards halted pilgrims on the Char Dham Yatra route and appealed to people to remain where they were and not travel in view of possibility of landslides. In Champawat, police had to rescue 200 pilgrims on their way to Purnagiri temple who were stranded following rain and landslides. A public advisory has also been issued to not trek to the Purnagiri temple for the next two-three days. CM Pushkar Singh Dhami tweeted that the home minister Amit Shah has assured all help from the central government to deal with the damage. Dhami also visited the disaster management control room at the secretariat and reviewed the situation. District magistrate of Rudraprayag Manuj Goyal informed the CM that there were 6,000 pilgrims in Kedarnath on Sunday out of which 4,000 have returned and around 2,000 are at safe locations. According to the Met office, Uttarakhand received 36.7mm of rain compared to the average of 2.4mm, registering an increase of 1400% in the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-landslides-kill-6-cut-off-nainital-road-links/articleshow/87123979.cms||---

Bhupendra Pratap Singh, 55, a retired school teacher who had been practising as a lawyer since 2019, was allegedly shot dead by his rival, also an advocate. The assailant, Suresh Gupta, fled after the attack, leaving behind a country-made pistol. Police scanned CCTV footage and zeroed in on Gupta later in the day. A blood-stained shirt of the accus-ed was among the other evidence seized, said police sources. Singh had a “rivalry with the advocate”, police said, and added that they ha-ve taken the latter into custody for questioning. There was anger among advocates across the state after the incident and protests were staged in most of the districts. The protesting lawyers claimed that the incident happened due to negligence on the part of the police. Inspector general, Bareilly range, Ramit Sharma said, “We have found out that the victim and his rival had registered over two dozen cases against each other in court. We questioned Gupta and he has confessed to have committed the murder.” Three policemen have been suspended. Police registered an FIR on a complaint by the victim’s kin against Gupta and his two sons under section 302 (murder) and 120b (criminal conspiracy). Police, however, didn’t find any evidence to link Suresh’s sons to the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lawyer-guns-down-lawyer-in-court-at-ups-shahjahanpur/articleshow/87123994.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The arson attack by over a hundred people happened late on Sunday in a village in Rangpur district’s Pirganj upazila, about 255 kms from Dhaka, the bdnews24.com reported. The police rushed to the village as tension mounted over a rumour that a Hindu resident had made a “blasphemous” post on Facebook, assistant police Superintendent Mohammad Kamruzzaman told reporters. “The incident took place after 10pm (local time) on Sunday but firefighters doused the blaze within a short period (and) the situation is now under full control,” he said. No casualties were reported but 66 houses were damaged and 20 burnt during the attack, the officer said. As many as 52 suspects have been arrested while a manhunt was launched for more suspects under a “combing operation” in collaboration with other security forces, he added. As the police stood guard around the man’s home, the attackers set fire to other homes nearby, the report said. According to a report by the fire service control room, the attack scene indicated that at least 29 residential houses, two kitchens, two barns and 20 haystacks belonging to 15 different owners were torched in Pirganj’s Majhipara. It said an “unruly crowd” has been identified as the cause of fire. The arson incident occurred amid rising communal tension over an alleged blasphemy incident at a Durga Puja venue in Cumilla which led to attacks on Hindu temples and clashes between vandals and the police in Cumilla, Chandpur, Chattogram, Cox’s Bazar, Bandarban, Moulvibazar, Gazipur, Chapainawabganj, Feni and other districts. Dozens of people have been arrested over the attacks, the report said. Four Muslim protesters were killed in the clashes with police in Haziganj, the worst scene of the violence, on Wednesday and Thursday, while the body of a Hindu devotee was found at a pond in nearby Begumbanj of Noakhali district. The Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christial Unity Council said at least 70 puja pavilions and temples were attacked in the previous three days of violence. It alleges that at least four Hindu devotees have died in the attacks in Chandpur and Noakhali. Authorities have not confirmed the figures. Meanwhile, the elite anti-crime force Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has arrested two more men in connection with the looting and vandalism of temples and shops belonging to the Hindu minority community in Feni, about 155 kms from Dhaka. On Saturday, one person was arrested in connection with the attack which took place when the Feni Puja celebration committee and its supporters were preparing to protest against the communal violence in the country. Approximately 40 people were injured in the violence. On Sunday, two cases were filed against 400 unnamed people. On Monday, Dhaka University students joined hands with protesting religious groups against the attacks on the temples, puja venues and homes of the Hindu community across Bangladesh, the report said.The protesters called for the formation of a separate ministry to handle affairs related to minority groups. The communal tensions came as the minority Hindus, who constitute 9% of Bangladesh’s 160 million population, celebrated their largest religious festival Durga Puja last week. PM Sheikh Hasina has said the attacks were part of a “well-designed plot” to destabilise the country. In a separate report, the bdnews24.com, quoting the prominent rights group in Bangladesh Ain o Salish Kendra, said that as many as 3,679 attacks on the minority Hindu community took place between January 2013 and September this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/no-end-to-communal-unrest-in-bangladesh-as-houses-are-torched/articleshow/87124019.cms||---

The underpass, officials said, would be formally opened to the public “if everything is in order” during the trial period that is likely to continue until Diwali. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has missed several deadlines, including the October 15 date announced by the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, to launch the project that seeks to cut an additional 4-kilometre drive up to Rajokri in Delhi for taking a U-turn to get to Ambience Mall, DLF Phase-3 and adjacent areas. “The point of opening the underpass for a trial run is to see whether everything is fine in terms of safety and convenience -- if cars are moving properly or commuters are facing any trouble in terms of the speed at which their vehicles can move, whether the lighting is proper and also to ensure there are no types of interference inside the structure,” an NHAI official said on Monday. During the trial run, the official added, the structure might be closed from time to time for undertaking rectification work or fix shortcomings. On Monday, too, the 377-metre-long underpass was closed for a few hours for electrical work, he added. Constructed at a cost of Rs 102.94 crore, the underpass is part of a wider project aimed at decongesting the expressway. Commuters travelling to Delhi and areas adjoining the Ambience mall, meanwhile, have expressed relief that the structure has finally been opened, even if on trial. “The underpass has missed so many deadlines that we had all given up on it being completed anytime soon. It was, hence, a nice surprise for us to find that it was open when we were returning home after having dinner at a relative’s house on Golf Course Road on Sunday night. A journey that would normally have taken us around 25 minutes was reduced to barely 15 minutes. ,” Partha Chatterjee, a resident of Ambience Island, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ggn-underpass-of-several-deadlines-opens-for-trial/articleshow/87119809.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The state syllabus has a focus on state-level topics, culture and language besides being best suited for the local needs of the students. Due to the local factors, student enrolment continues to be strong at the state board schools compared to CBSE and ICSE schools. The affordable private education also makes the state schools attractive for parents. CBSE education is expected to give an edge to the students while competing in national-level entrance tests such as JEE, NEET and others. Venu Mohan Manga, secretary and correspondent of Little Angels School, MVP colony, said the CBSE exam pattern tests the originality and contextual knowledge of the students. “The best CBSE textbooks can be procured from even top private publishers after a thorough research while there are no such options in the state board,” said Venu Mohan. K Prakasa Rao, state general secretary of Andhra Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association, said there is no major variation in syllabuses other than the local preference in the state board textbooks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/application-at-core-of-cbse-syllabus/articleshow/87117312.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||World||Colin Powell dies of Covid-19 At 84||WASHINGTON: Colin Powell, who in four decades of public life served as the nation’s top soldier, diplomat and national security adviser, and whose speech at the UN in 2003 helped pave the way for the US to go to war in Iraq, died on Monday. He was 84. The cause was complications of Covid-19, his family said in a statement, adding that he had been vaccinated. Powell had undergone treatment for multiple myeloma, which compromised his immune system, a spokeswoman said. She said he was due to receive a booster shot for his vaccine last week but could not because he had fallen ill. Powell was a path breaker serving as the country’s first African-American national security adviser, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and secretary of state. Born in Harlem of Jamaican parents, Powell grew up in the South Bronx and graduated from City College of New York, joining the army through the Reserve Officer Training Corps programme. From a young second lieutenant commissioned in the dawn of a newly desegregated army, Powell served two decorated combat tours in Vietnam. He was later NSA to President Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War, helping to negotiate arms treaties and an era of cooperation with the Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev. As chairman of the joint chiefs, he was the architect of the invasion of Panama in 1989 and of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, which ousted Saddam Hussein from Kuwait but left him in power in Iraq. Along with then-defence secretary Dick Cheney, Powell reshaped the American Cold War military that stood ready at the Iron Curtain for half a century. In doing so he stamped the Powell Doctrine on military operations — armed with clear political objectives and public support, use decisive and overwhelming force to defeat enemy forces. When briefing reporters at the Pentagon at the beginning of the Gulf War, Powell succinctly summed up the military’s strategy to defeat Saddam Hussein’s army: “Our strategy in going after this army is very simple,” he said. “First, we’re going to cut it off, and then we’re going to kill it.” It was a concept that seemed less suited to the messy conflicts in the Balkans that came later in the 1990s and in combating terrorism in a world transformed after the attacks on September 11, 2001. By the time he retired from the military in 1993, Powell was one of the most popular public figures in the US. In an interview with New York Times in 2007, he analysed himself: “Powell is a problem-solver. So he has views, but he’s not an ideologue. He has passion, but he’s not a fanatic. He’s first and foremost a problem-solver.” Powell was the first American official to publicly lay the blame for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network and made a lightning trip to Pakistan in October, 2001 to demand that then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf cooperate with the US in going after the Afghanistan-based group. Once retired, Powell, a lifelong independent while in uniform, was courted as a presidential contender by Republicans and Democrats, and became America’s most political general since Dwight Eisenhower. He wrote a best-selling memoir, “My American Journey,” and flirted with a run for the presidency before deciding in 1995 that campaigning for office wasn’t for him. He returned to public service in 2001 as secretary of state to President George W Bush, whose father Powell had served as chairman of the joint chiefs a decade earlier. His legacy was marred when, in 2003, he went before the UN Security Council as secretary of state and made the case for US war against Iraq at a moment of great international skepticism. He cited faulty information claiming Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed away weapons of mass destruction. Iraq’s claims that it had no such weapons represented “a web of lies”, he told the world body. That speech, replete with his display of a vial of what he said could have been a biological weapon, was later derided as a low-point in Powell’s career. He left at the end of Bush’s first term under the cloud of an ever-worsening war in Iraq, and growing questions about whether he could have and should have done more to object to it. He kept a low profile for the next few years, but with just over two weeks left in the 2008 presidential campaign, Powell, by then a declared Republican, gave a forceful endorsement to Senator Barack Obama. He later emerged as a vocal Trump critic in recent years, describing Trump as “a national disgrace”. Following the January 6 storming of the US Capitol, Powell said he no longer considers himself a Republican. agencies As chairman of the joint chiefs, Colin Powell was the architect of the invasion of Panama in 1989 and of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. In 2003, he went before the UNSC as secretary of state and made the case for US war against Iraq.

Since the use of AZ’s vector-based vaccine was halted for people younger than 65 years of age due to safety concerns, all individuals in Sweden who had already received their first dose of this vaccine were recommended an mRNA vaccine as their second dose. “...Our study shows a greater risk reduction for people who received an mRNA vaccine after having received a first dose of a vector-based, as compared to people having received the vector-based vaccine for both doses,” said Peter Nordstrom of Umea University. The study was published in Lancet Regional Health - Europe journal on Monday. In the main analysis, about 7,00,000 individuals were included. During a 2.5-month average follow-up period after the second dose, the study showed a 67% lower risk of infection for the combination of AZ and Pfizer shots. There was a 79% lower risk of infection for AZ and Moderna shots, compared to unvaccinated individuals, the researchers said. For people having got two doses of the AZ vaccine (Covishield in India), the risk reduction was 50%, they said. The researchers noted that the study estimates of effectiveness apply to infection with the Delta variant, which was dominating the confirmed cases during the follow-up period.“The results of the study may have implications for vaccination strategies in different countries,” said Marcel Ballin, doctoral student at Umea University, and study’s co-author. There was a very low incidence of thromboembolic events, or blood clots in blood vessels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/az-mrna-vax-combo-highly-effective-lancet-study/articleshow/87124142.cms||---

The army on October 6 had announced that ISI director general Lt Gen Faiz Hamid was being replaced by Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum. However, the office of PM Imran Khan refused to issue a notification of the appointment. The matter has not been settled until now despite statements by ministers that it has been resolved. The army said Gen Bajwa was received by Lt Gen Hamid at the ISI headquarters. Bajwa was briefed on the internal security and ongoing situation in Afghanistan and he expressed his satisfaction over the preparedness of the organisation, according to an official statement. The visit took place when Lt Gen Muhammad Aamer assumed command as the new Gujranwala Corps Commander. The posting was among the six appointments announced by the military on October 6 and showed that the reshuffle was being effected. However, it was not clear when Lt Gen Hamid would take command as Peshawar Corps Commander.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-army-chief-visits-isi-headquarters-amid-tiff-over-appointment-of-spy-chief/articleshow/87124259.cms||---
---||World||Russia breaks diplomatic engagement with Nato||MOSCOW: Russia plans to cease its diplomatic engagement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), the Russian foreign minister said on Monday, in the latest sign of unravelling relations between Moscow and the West. Although significant on a diplomatic level, the announcement was not apparently accompanied by any military moves by Russia threatening European security. And Moscow still maintains diplomatic relations with the individual governments in the alliance. The decision will end a post-Cold War experiment, never very successful, in building trust between Russia and the Western alliance, established decades ago to contain the Soviet Union, which officials in Moscow accused of later encroaching on former Soviet territory. By early next month, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said, Russia will halt the activities of its representative office at Nato headquarters in Brussels and withdraw diplomatic credentials from emissaries of the alliance working in Moscow. Nato’s response was muted. “We have taken note of minister Lavrov’s comments to the media, however we have not received any official communication on the issues he raised,” a spokesperson, Oana Lungescu, said. Lavrov said the alliance was informed before his announcement. The breakoff of diplomatic ties also comes as President Joe Biden is seeking to strengthen the European alliance after former President Donald Trump denigrated members as freeloaders on US military spending. Relations between Moscow and the West have been strained for years, but the immediate impetus for the Russian move was a spy scandal. Earlier this month, Nato ordered eight Russian diplomats to leave Belgium by November 1, saying they were undeclared intelligence officers. The alliance also reduced the size of the Russian representative office. In response, Lavrov said Russia’s entire diplomatic mission would leave by November 1. Nato could still convey diplomatic messages to Russia’s embassy in Brussels, if necessary, Lavrov said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/russia-breaks-diplomatic-engagement-with-nato/articleshow/87124345.cms||---

The warning involved messages in which Gates, who at the time was a full-time employee and the company’s chairman, asked an employee out on a date. Senior Microsoft executives learned of the emails in 2008, according to Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman. “These emails proposed meeting outside of work and off campus,” Shaw said. “While flirtatious, they were not overtly sexual, but were deemed to be inappropriate.” After they discovered the messages, executives warned Gates that his behaviour was inappropriate and notified a small group of board members about the incident. Gates told the board members that he agreed that what he had done was inappropriate, and the board took no further action. The executives’ warnings to Gates were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. A spokeswoman for Gates, told The Journal, “These claims are false, recycled rumours...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/in-2008-ms-execs-had-warned-gates-over-inappropriate-emails-to-female-employee/articleshow/87124449.cms||---

The gruesome incident was reported from Vedurubeedam village, under Mylavaram tehsil in Krishna district. While Kolusu Kondal Rao (45) succumbed to his injuries while receiving treatment at Mylavaram government hospital, his wife is in a critical condition. According to Mylavaram police, the incident happened at around 4 am when the accused, Veerla Rambabu, a native of Balliparru village in Gannavaram mandal, reached his in-laws’ place and attacked them with a knife while they were asleep. He managed to escape from the spot when neighbours started waking up after hearing the victims’ cries for help. By the time locals rushed to the house, Rambabu was nowhere to be seen, while Rao and his wife were lying in a pool of blood. Both were rushed to the nearest hospital in an ambulance where Rao succumbed to his injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/1-dead-as-man-goes-on-stabbing-spree-at-in-laws-place/articleshow/87118520.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Former BJD minister Anjali Behera joins BJP||BHUBANESWAR: Anjali Behera, a three-time former BJD MLA from Hindol and a former minister, joined the BJP on Monday. The BJD had expelled Anjali in 2014 for revolting against the party and contesting the assembly election as a rebel. Addressing a gathering after joining the saffron party in the presence of Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Anjali said, “My parents, my family and I worked selflessly for the people of Dhenkanal. But instead of allowing us to continue to serve them, the BJD harmed us and kicked us out.” Pitting her former party against the current one, she added, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been giving top priority to inclusive development, while corruption at the block and district-level in Odisha governed by the BJD is depriving people of the benefits of social welfare schemes. Our fight will be against such corruption by strengthening the BJP.” Anjali, 49, was elected from the Hindol seat reserved for scheduled castes thrice in a row in 2000, 2004 and 2009. Her father, Trinath Nayak, was also elected from the same constituency thrice as a Janata Dal nominee. After being denied a party ticket in 2014, Anjali had unsuccessfully entered the fray as an independent but lost the poll to BJD candidate Simarani Nayak. The BJD had expelled her from the party. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had dropped her as the women and child development minister in 2012 for dissidence, along with Sanjiv Sahoo, following an alleged unsuccessful bid to dislodge Naveen by his adviser-turned foe Pyarimohan Mohapatra. With panchayat and urban elections likely to be held one after the other early next year, switching from one party to another has already begun. BJP hopes Anjali’s induction into the party will help it consolidate the Dalit votes. Apart from Anjali, Santosh Kumar Rout, some formerZP and panchayat representatives from Dhenkanal and Angul districts, also joined the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/former-bjd-min-anjali-joins-bjp/articleshow/87113933.cms||---

---||World||Zalmay Khalilzad, US envoy who brokered Afghan exit, quits||WASHINGTON: Zalmay Khalilzad, the veteran US envoy whose months of hotel-ballroom diplomacy helped end the US war in Afghanistan but failed at preventing a Taliban takeover, resigned on Monday. In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Khalilzad defended his record but acknowledged that he came up short and said he wanted to make way during the "new phase of our Afghanistan policy." "The political arrangement between the Afghan government and the Taliban did not go forward as envisaged," he wrote. "The reasons for this are too complex and I will share my thoughts in the coming day and weeks." Born in Afghanistan, the dapper 70-year-old academic turned US diplomat took senior positions under former president George W. Bush, becoming the US ambassador to Kabul and then Baghdad and the United Nations. As former president Donald Trump itched to end America's longest war in Afghanistan, he brought back Khalilzad, who led exhaustive talks with the Taliban -- without including the US-backed government in Kabul. Those talks led to a February 2020 agreement in which US troops would leave the following year. But peace negotiations between the Taliban and the leadership in Kabul failed to gain traction, and the government that the United States built over 20 years crumbled within days as US troops left. Khalilzad, despite his Republican affiliation, was kept in place when Democratic President Joe Biden defeated Trump and decided to go ahead with the withdrawal. Khalilzad soon became a lightning rod for criticism, with even his superiors in the Biden administration -- while voicing respect for him personally -- faulting the diplomacy behind the 2020 agreement. Blinken said that Khalilzad's deputy, Thomas West, would take over as the special envoy. West is a veteran aide to President Joe Biden, serving on his staff when he was vice president. West has worked for years on South Asia policy including on the US-India civilian nuclear deal. Khalilzad also courted US adversaries China and Russia, succeeding in reaching public statements in which the countries would show a united front. Shortly before Khalilzad's resignation became public, the State Department said the United States would not be able to attend a new session called Tuesday by Russia that also includes China and Pakistan, historically the Taliban's primary backer. Steeped in Afghanistan's language and customs, Khalilzad was a rare US diplomat able to develop a friendly rapport with the Taliban foes whose regime had been ousted after the September 11, 2001 attacks. After Trump ended US opposition to speaking to the Taliban, Khalilzad engineered the release from a Pakistani jail of the group's co-founder Mullah Baradar, seen as a figure who could deliver on promises, and spent months with the largely rural rebels in a luxury hotel in the Qatari capital Doha. But pictures of him smiling with the Taliban earned him heated criticism in Kabul where some in the now-fallen government as well as Western-oriented social media users berated him and accused him of selling out Afghanistan. In an interview last month, Khalilzad said that he had reached a deal with the Taliban in which the Islamist insurgents would stay out of Kabul and negotiate a political transition. But Khalilzad said that the deal collapsed when president Ashraf Ghani fled the country and the Taliban saw a security vacuum. Speaking to Foreign Policy, Khalilzad said that the Taliban fulfilled key parts of the February 2020 agreement including not attacking the departing US troops. "I respect those who say we shouldn't have negotiated with the Talibs without the government being there. But we don't know how much more fighting would have taken for the Talibs to agree to that," he said. But with no appetite in the United States for another surge of troops in its longest war, "each year we were losing ground to the Talibs," he said. "Time was not on our side."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/zalmay-khalilzad-us-envoy-who-brokered-afghan-exit-quits/articleshow/87124737.cms||---

In another development later in the day, the SIT arrested four aides of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish. The accused, including Sumit Jaiswal, who got the counter-complaint lodged against the farmers, had been absconding after their convoy allegedly mowed down four farmers and a journalist. In a video that went viral, purportedly from the Kheri violence, Jaiswal, in a blue kurta, was seen coming out of the Thar (an SUV) that ran farmers over. He gave multiple interviews to news channels thereafter. The day the SIT was formed, he suddenly went missing. The other three accused were identified as Shishupal, who was allegedly driving the third SUV (a white Scorpio), Nandan Singh Bisht and Satya Prakash Tripathi. A licensed pistol and three bullets were recovered from Tripathi, a resident of Kaushambi district, who was in the second SUV (a black Fortuner) and had fled the spot. Jaiswal is a BJP worker and a ward member from Lakhimpur city while Nandan Singh Bisht is an accountant for Ankit Das, one of the key accused in the case who was arrested earlier along with Mishra following protests by farmer groups. A total of 10 arrests have been made by the SIT in the case. SIT officials said the four were arrested from their respective residences. A senior official claimed the four were present at the spot on the day of the incident. Special prosecution officer S P Yadav told TOI the four accused will be produced in front of a remand magistrate on Tuesday since the regular court will be closed on account of a holiday. “SIT is questioning the accused and may seek remand custody if needed,” he said. Meanwhile, 15 farmers appeared before the SIT on Monday to record their statements in the alleged lynching case after notices were issued to them under sections of the CrPC. An SIT member said, “We have been investigating both the FIRs and the farmers were summoned in connection to the second FIR and they were sent back after questioning.” Every farmer was questioned for over 15 minutes in the presence of their advocate Mohammed Amaan, sources said. Jasbir Singh Virk, president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan, told TOI that of the 15 farmers who appeared before the SIT, only 11 recorded their statement due to lack of time. "The SIT asked questions related to the incident and the same statement was recorded for both the FIRs. They were asked questions such as how did they realise they were in danger and what did they do after farmers were mowed down etc. We have told the SIT members that farmers will cooperate with them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sit-summons-over-50-farmers-in-kheri-case-arrests-4-aides-of-ministers-son/articleshow/87124685.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Doctor removes kidney instead of stone, hospital to pay Rs 11.2 lakh damages||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has ordered Balasinor’s KMG General Hospital to pay Rs 11.23 lakh compensation to a patient’s relative after the doctor removed his left kidney after the patient was admitted for removal of kidney stones. The patient died four months after the vital organ was taken out. The consumer court held that the hospital has direct or vicarious liability for the negligent act of its employee-in this case the operating doctor. "The employer is responsible not only for his own acts or commission and omission, but also for the negligence of its employees so long as the act occurs within the course and scope of the employment. This liability is according to the principle of ‘respondent superior’ meaning ‘let the master answer’," the court observed. It ordered the hospital to pay compensation with 7.5% interest since 2012. In this case, Devendrabhai Raval from Vanghroli village of Kheda district consulted Dr Shivubhai Patel of KMG General Hospital in Balasinor town for severe back pain and difficulty in passing urine. In May 2011, he was diagnosed with a 14 mm stone in his left kidney. Raval was advised to go to a better facility, but he chose to undergo surgery in the same hospital. He was operated upon on September 3, 2011. After the surgery, the family was surprised when the doctor said that instead of the stone, the kidney had to be removed. The doctor cited it was done in the best interest of the patient. When Raval began having greater problems in passing urine, he was advised to shift to a kidney hospital in Nadiad. Later when his condition deteriorated further, he was taken to IKDRC in Ahmedabad. He succumbed to renal complications on January 8, 2012. His widow, Minaben, approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission at Nadiad, which in 2012 ordered the doctor, the hospital and the United India Insurance Co Ltd to pay compensation of Rs 11.23 lakh to the widow for the medical negligence. The district commission’s order brought the hospital and the insurance company to the state commission over the dispute as to who should be held liable to pay compensation. After hearing the dispute, the state commission observed that the hospital had the insurance policy for indoor and outdoor patients, but the insurer was not liable for medical negligence by the treating doctor. The surgery was just for removal of stone from the kidney and the consent was taken for removal of stone only, but the kidney was removed instead. Thus, it is a clear case of negligence on part of the doctor and hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doc-removes-kidney-during-kidney-stone-operation-to-pay-damages/articleshow/87119853.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Business||Sensex up for 7th day, nears 62k||Mumbai: Rising for the seventh consecutive session, the sensex gained 460 points on Monday and closed near the 62k mark at 61,766, a new life-high level. In a one-way run since October 6, the index has added nearly 1,600 points or 2.7% as unabated buying continued despite muted foreign activity, rising crude oil prices, a looming power crisis and weak economic data from China. The day’s session also took India’s market capitalisation to about Rs 277.3 lakh crore, translating into $3.7 trillion — also a life-high figure. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net bought Indian stocks worth about Rs 730 crore this month, data collated from the BSE and CDSL showed. In contrast, net buying by FPIs in September was Rs 13,154 crore. In the past few weeks, there have been talks of a possible power crisis in India due to shortage of coal stock with power producers. In the past two days, however, unseasonal gave were a respite from the problem, analysts said. Globally, recent data showed that crude oil prices are at about a seven-year high level, mainly due to increasing demand as supply of natural gas has fallen of late. On Monday evening, WTI crude was trading at over $82 per barrel while Brent crude was trading at near the $84.5 level. During the day China announced that for the quarter ended September, the world’s second-largest economy had grown at 4.9% compared to an estimated 5.1%, and 7.9% a year earlier. While global factors limited gains in markets outside of India, the domestic market continued to scale new highs, backed mainly by strong corporate results. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, in the absence of any major event, earnings will remain in focus and “we have a long list of index majors announcing their results this week”. Participants will be closely eyeing the management commentaries for the future growth outlook. “Global cues would also be on investors’ radar,” Mishra wrote in a post-market note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-up-for-7th-day-nears-62k/articleshow/87121043.cms||---

Incidentally, the man, Chirag Chauhan, had been living the girl, whom he was accused of abducting and raping, and the couple even have a four-year-old child. As the girl was 17 years old then, Chauhan was booked under the charges of kidnapping to force her for marriage and rape after her father lodged a complaint with Jawaharnagar police station in April 2011. Last week, however, the court discharged him of the allegations of abducting and raping the girl in 2011, who is his wife now. Chauhan was facing trial in the sessions court here. During the hearing of the case, the woman, whom Chauhan was accused of kidnapping, gave testimony that she was not abducted but had left her parents’ home at her own will as they were planning to marry her off to a 30-year-old man. “She had run away from her house a night before the marriage as she did not want to marry the man and liked my client but her parents were against it,” said Chauhan’s lawyer Nandkishor Shah. He added that she went to Chauhan’s home and asked him to run away to get married, but he was hesitant initially fearing the repercussions. But later, he agreed when she insisted and they went to Rajasthan. Living in a rented house, Chauhan and the girl had consensual physical relations, Shah said, and when she became an adult, they got married and returned to Vadodara. “The court upheld her statement that she had left her parents’ home on her own and this boy had not abducted him. Regarding the rape too, she said that it was a consensual relationship and not a forced one,” Shah told TOI. “The act is considered to be rape, with or without consent if the woman is under 16 years of age, but here she was 17-and-half when they had consensual relation which also the court considered,” the lawyer added. The court of principal district judge M R Mengdey while discharging Chauhan stated that there is no material available on record to prosecute him for the offences he is accused of.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rape-accused-now-married-to-survivor/articleshow/87119915.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The count of active jobs in specific sectors like IT and BFSI crossed pre-Covid levels. September also saw a 5-10% rise in month-on-month jobs count with physical retail, travel and hospitality on the road to recovery, and the e-commerce sector prepping for a festive season boom. “Year-on-year, our estimates suggest hiring activity is up by 80-100%. The October-December quarter is traditionally marked by finalisation of HR budgets and plans and we expect almost a 50% increase in jobs activity in this period compared to July-September,” Anshul Lodha, head of Page Executive, India, said. Both traditional and new age companies are expanding teams on the back of diverted capital flows to India from China, he added. The sustained rise in hiring activity across sectors is creating a supply crunch for talent, making it an employee market, where companies employ measures like hybrid work and increased frequency of increments and promotions to attract and retain workforce, HR firms said. Specialist staffing firm Xpheno’s monthly analysis showed that September closed at 285,000 active white-collar jobs with a marginal 3% growth over August and growing 60% from the 176,000 jobs in September 2020. Active jobs in September emerged as the second-highest count for the current calendar year after March’s 290,000, the research showed. “IT services companies will continue to see the build-buy-borrow model of freshers-laterals-contractors, whereas startups, product companies and global captives will continue to grow by hiring a higher percentage of laterals,” Xpheno co-founder Kamal Karanth said. Hiring activity crossed pre-pandemic levels with job postings as on October 1 higher by 9.6% from the baseline levels of February 2020, data from jobs site Indeed.com showed. Sashi Kumar, head of sales at Indeed India, said there is “an air of cautious optimism” as the economy picks up and the job market will continue to witness growth on the back of the approaching festive season. Increased hiring for functional roles indicate businesses are recovering from the impact of the second wave and focused on stabilising operations backed by a robust vaccination drive, he added. Job postings for functional roles such as system engineer, test engineer, lead engineer, process engineer, etc, increased by 43% YoY in September, data from Indeed showed. On a hierarchy basis, fresher hiring is outpacing other job levels as businesses look to optimise costs with fresher hiring. Job portal Naukri’s data showed that the job market maintained its record streak for the third consecutive month in a row, clocking 57% YoY growth in September, according to its JobSpeak index. At 2,753, the index hit an all-time high in September surpassing pre-Covid levels in September 2019 by 21%. Most sectors showed significant YoY hiring growth, according to Naukri, led by the IT products and services sector that grew by 138%. Hospitality (+82%), retail (+70%), banking/financial services (+43%) and telecom/ISP (+37%) also witnessed significant growth with businesses across the country reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-hospitality-keepjob-mkt-on-growth-path/articleshow/87118972.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Coimbatore||Min: Central jails will be converted into open prisons||Coimbatore: Law minister S Regupathy on Monday unveiled the government’s policy decision to convert all the central prisons in the state into open air jails and modernize them with all facilities. Addressing the media at the city central prison, he said, “We have to identify land to set up open air jails in the state. The government will take decisions on this matter. It is not easy to start the process now, as the government is facing a severe financial crisis.” When asked about relocating Coimbatore Central Prison, the minister said former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced the plans to set up a ‘Semmozhi Poonga’ on the central prison premises during the world classical Tamil conference in 2010 and the same would be brought to the attention of the incumbent chief minister M K Stalin. “If the government decides to set up the park, the central prison will be shifted to another location, which would be decided later. As of now, we don’t have any plans to relocate the prison,” the minister said. Regupathy said the state government was considering the plea for early release of life convicts, who had served the sentence for more than 10 years. The minister paid floral tributes to the portrait of freedom fighter V O Chidambaram Pillai and the oil press, which the freedom fighter was forced to pull when the British government had lodged him in the Coimbatore Central Prison during the freedom struggle. Regupathy also interacted with the prison inmates, who demanded the premature release of life convicts, who had completed 10 years of jail term. The minister was accompanied by district collector G S Sameeran, city corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, deputy inspector general of prisons G Shanmuga Sundaram, superintendent of Coimbatore Central Prison G B Senthamaraikannan and former DMK MLA N Karthik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/min-central-jails-will-be-converted-into-open-prisons/articleshow/87121495.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body has directed the sanitation workers to clean all the 92 ghats under the municipal area. “The artificial ponds will be drained out and we will take the sludge and leftover mud in order to level the ground. So, we must keep the ghats clean for devotees to perform puja comfortably,” said one of the sanitation workers near Kali Ghat. Another worker said, “Immersions did not taken place at all these ghats as artificial ponds were made. Yet, we have decided to clear them keeping in mind the rush during Chhath Puja.” Municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the cleanliness drive that started on Monday will continue for weeks, making the banks and the river clean enough before Chhath festival. “In all the circles, sufficient sanitation workers have been deputed to clean the ghats. Arrangements for Chhath Puja will be made on the instruction of district authorities at those ghats which will be declared fit,” he told this newspaper. “Cleaning of ghats is a routine exercise of the civic body,” he said. The district officials said the preparation at ghats for Chhath will be planned after the instruction from the state home department in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision is likely to be made in the next couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cleaning-of-ghats-for-chhath-begins/articleshow/87118584.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Ahmedabad||Fit and fine? Gujarat has 1.08 crore vehicles that’ll need testing||AHMEDABAD: If you drive an old vehicle, better check how old it is. Over 38% vehicles plying on Gujarat’s roads and 33% vehicles on the streets of Ahmedabad are at least 15 years old. And, all these vehicles will have to undergo the automated fitness test (AFT). The number assumes significance in the backdrop of the Centre working on phasing out old and polluting vehicles under its vehicle-scrapping policy. AFT will be mandatory for commercial vehicles from 2023 and for private vehicles, including two-wheelers, from 2024. An official of the state transport department, which is preparing the rules under the central policy, said, “We looked at figures available with Parivahan service and the Ministry of Road and Transport. As on September 30, 2021, the department estimates that of the 2.84 crore registered vehicles in the state, 1.08 crore vehicles will fall in the 15-year bracket in 2023. Of the 47.68 lakh vehicles in Ahmedabad, there will be 15.86 lakh vehicles that are over 15 years old.” The official said that around 9% of these are commercial vehicles, including buses. The state transport department is now preparing detailed rules to ensure that these vehicles undergo fitness test. Another official from the department said that each vehicle will have to be certified through a computerized automated test and these reports will be uploaded on the website of Parivahan without any human intervention.  “The person will have the option to keep the vehicle with him or scrap it if it is certified as a ‘non-use’ vehicle,” the official said. Gujarat has an automated testing centre in Olpad in Surat. “Two more are coming up in Ahmedabad and Anjar,” said Transport commissioner Rajesh Manjhu. “Under the rules, such automated testing centres can be set up through public-private partnership so we have initiated the process for this. The guidelines state that for transport and passenger vehicles, automated tests will be made compulsory from April 1, 2023. For private vehicles, testing will begin from April 1, 2024.” Manjhu said, “At present, a manual certificate is required for commercial vehicles every two years from the date of purchase. After eight such certifications, the vehicle has to be certified fit every year. However, till now, there were no such provisions for private vehicles.” Officials in the department clarified that once the new rules are implemented, private vehicles will have to be inspected every five years after the registration ceases to end after 15 years from the date of purchase. However, transport vehicles will have to be certified every year. He said, “At present, any showroom with service station can certify a commercial vehicle as fit for use even if that is not the case. However, with these automated centres, it will become difficult for transport vehicles to pass the tests if they are not in good condition."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fit-and-fine-guj-has-1-08cr-vehicles-thatll-need-testing/articleshow/87119779.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Business||PNB Hsg stock falls 5% on aborted Carlyle deal||Mumbai: Shares of PNB Housing Finance fell 5% to be locked in the lower circuit limit after the company said that it scrapped a proposal to allot a Rs 4,000-crore share placement with private equity firm Carlyle Group and others. The objection to the issue started with Sebi stalling a shareholder meeting called by PNB Housing on the grounds that the issue price should have been arrived at by an independent valuer. Sebi had taken a hard stance and had approached the Supreme Court against a Securities Appellate Tribunal order. The matter is currently pending before the Supreme Court. The PNB stock fell 5% to its lower circuit limit of Rs 607 on the BSE. On the NSE too, it declined nearly 5% to its lower circuit of Rs 606.7. The share price had shot up to Rs 881 following the announcement of the Carlyle deal. One of the reasons for the market’s enthusiasm was that Aditya Puri, who built and led HDFC Bank for 25 years, was a minority investor with Carlyle. However, the spike in price led advisory firms to allege that the issue was under-priced. PNB’s MD S S Mallikarjuna Rao had held that there was no error of judgment in the pricing. “It would never have been thought by anyone that the price would increase so high in the subsequent days based on the decision taken by the company,” said Rao in a results call in August. “The board has decided not to proceed with the preferential issue and the share subscription agreements executed with the proposed allottees have been terminated in accordance with their respective terms,” PNB Housing Finance said in a regulatory filing. The board’s primary objective is to raise capital to support the growth of the company, and the board believes that the current situation is not in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pnb-hsg-stock-falls-5-on-aborted-carlyle-deal/articleshow/87120987.cms||---

The Nagpur Municipal corporation had made institutional quarantine compulsory for all new patients with exemption in special cases. The patients were quarantined at the CCC since August 25 but the civic body had to hand over the facility back to the state PWD.The civic body has now decided to shift patients to AIIMS Nagpur where they would be part of an ongoing anti-viral therapy.Though the NMC has its own hospitals within the city limits, civic officials said the new patients would be given the option of AIIMS Nagpur for mandatory institutional quarantine to facilitate the study. Already, the district is reporting less than 5 or10 cases every day.The clinical trial was planned three months ago. AIIMS Nagpur officials said they have sought consent of patients for the study as per the routine practice in any clinical trial.“Patients are basically getting admitted for treatment only. It is also beneficial in case they need investigation like a CT scan or blood test. The NMC told us that they are transferring patients as per their wish. Even non-Covid patients on testing postive at private hospitals are shifting to AIIMS Nagpur for Covid treatment though they can continue in the same hospital,” officials said.Currently, a separate ward has been reserved for Covid patients at AIIMS Nagpur where over 100 beds were functional during the second wave.Two more studies were conducted by AIIMS Nagpur and their analysis is yet to be done. About 45 patients in the first and 12 in the other clinical trial were taken. Findings are likely to be published in December. “Two more are planned but the institute doesn’t have enough patients to conduct them,” said officials.They added that till date there is no proven anti-viral drug for Covid. “Trials are going on across the world. AIIMS Nagpur is among the over 50 centres in India where the anti-viral drug trials are under way. Fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccainted are all part of the clinical study. The institute is prepared for a possible third wave,” they said.There are a number of anti-viral drugs which are being tried on Covid patients. “Steroids save lives but that too under certain conditions. Remdesivir improves recovery time but doesn’t save lives and hence, efforts are on to find a cure,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-patients-quarantine-at-aiims-nagpur-to-be-part-of-anti-viral-therapy/articleshow/87116714.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

According to the disaster management department (DMD), around 16 lakh families had been hit by the floods this year, out of which 14.46 lakh families got the GR through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) method. The state DMD on Monday said 79.31 lakh people in 31 of the 38 districts were affected by the floods in four phases – from June 13 to 17, from July 1 to 7, from August 1 to 22 and from September 30 to October 4. Normally, the monsoon and floods are expected till October 31. As many as 3,683 panchayats in 294 blocks were partially or completely hit by the floods that claimed 60 human lives, besides killing 95 cattle. The next of kin of the deceased 60 persons were paid Rs2.40 crore as ex gratia, while the owners of the dead cattle received Rs28.40 lakh as compensation. The government spent Rs1.71 crore on providing cattle feed during the floods in 31 districts. A four-member central team last month had assessed the damages caused by the floods to crops, roads and other infrastructural assets and the money incurred on the running of relief camps. The DMD communique said on the basis of the initial reports on the damages furnished by various departments, a memorandum was sent to the central government seeking central assistance. The final memorandum in this regard will be sent to the central government after the departments concerned submit their final reports. As pointed out by the agriculture department, crops worth Rs902.08 crore in 6.64 lakh hectares of land were damaged by the floods this year, while farmers could not do farming activities on another chunk of 1.41 lakh hectares due to waterlogging. The government has decided to provide agriculture input subsidy (AIS) to farmers, including worth Rs96.03 crore at the rate of Rs6,800 per hectare for the land that remained fallow due to waterlogging. That apart, Rs13,500 worth of AIS per hectare will be paid to farmers for the irrigated land and Rs6,800 per hectare for the non-irrigated land, while Rs18,000 per hectare of the AIS is marked for the arable land. The water resources department (WRD) spent Rs583 crore on repair and strengthening of the embankments and bunds either damaged or stressed during the floods. The DMD also said the government spent Rs105 crore on providing food and other amenities to 41,821 flood-affected people at 88 relief camps and also on providing food to 2.10 crore people at 1,956 community kitchens. Besides, a girl child born at the relief camp was provided Rs15,000 as assistance to her parents and Rs 10,000 to the parents of the newborn male child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/over-1-50-lakh-more-flood-hit-families-to-get-gratuitous-relief/articleshow/87118508.cms||Abhay Singh

The launch follows the insurance regulator Irdai’s directions to the non-life industry to come up with a comprehensive cover for drones, for both liability as well as physical damage to the hull. Tata AIG’s RPAS insurance includes drones and is a comprehensive product covering both hull and third-party liability risks faced by them. It also provides optional coverage for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations, night flying, and data loss liability. TropoGo has established an integrated marketplace providing a one-stop shop for the complete drone ecosystem, while Tata AIG has been at the forefront and has closely engaged with the Drone Federation of India (DFI) to understand the various types of risks faced by drone owners and operators. The civil aviation ministry foresees an investment of over Rs 5,000 crore in the drone manufacturing industry over three years, leading to annual sales turnover reaching over Rs 900 crore by FY24. “We have co-created a market-fit product with due consideration given to invaluable inputs from the DFI. Our product fulfils the market requirement and is in line with the recommendations of the working group formed by Irdai on RPAS insurance,” said TATA AIG General Insurance president (commercial business) Sushant Sarin. “The recent liberalisation of rules for owning and operating drones, coupled with the announcement of a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, is an important milestone that will spur high growth of this segment,” Sarin added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-aig-rolls-out-drone-insurance/articleshow/87120950.cms||---

I want to execute some drinking water supply schemes in my ward. But my husband is creating hurdles. Please take action against him for creating hurdles in the government schemes,” Pinki Kumari urged the CM during his janata darbar on Monday. Soon after listening to her complaint, the CM spoke to a senior officer in the panchayati raj department over phone and asked him to look into the matter immediately. Another woman complainant from West Champaran district told the CM that her father, who was an employee of the sugarcane industries department, died on December 6, 1997. But she could not get a government job on the compassionate grounds even after 24 years of his death. Surprised over the inordinate delay in her case, the CM asked the department officials to look into the matter on a priority basis. Another complainant from Nawada’s Nardiganj block told the CM that the tap water supply scheme could not be implanted in his ward due to callous attitude of the mukhiya. The CM asked the department concerned to look into the matter. Nitish on Monday heard the complaints of a total 149 people from different parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-urges-cm-to-punish-hubby/articleshow/87118825.cms||Madan Kumar

A complaint in this regard was lodged with the Marhaura police station on Sunday. In the complaint, the victim alleged that two youths — Arman Sada and Munna Rai — held her captive, forcibly escorted her to a deserted place and took turns to rape her. They were carrying daggers with them. The incident took place at around 11pm on October 15 when she was returning home after watching a cultural programme. Though she cried for help, nobody heard her voice due to blaring of the public address system at high volume. The Marhaura police station house officer (SHO), Arvind Kumar, said Arman was arrested from Senduari village and produced before a Chhapra court, which remanded him in 14-day judicial custody. The SHO said raids were on to nab another accused, Munna. The victim was sent to the Sadar hospital at Chhapra for medical examination. The medical report is awaited, the SHO said, adding that the torn clothes of the survivor will be sent to the forensic lab for test. An investigating officer said the girl initially could not muster courage to report the incident to the police due to threat from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/1-held-in-saran-girls-rape-case/articleshow/87118768.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar: Light rain likely to continue today||PATNA: The weathermen have predicted light to heavy showers with thunderstorm and lightning in the state on Tuesday as well after light to moderate rainfall in Patna and several other parts of Bihar on Monday due to approaching low pressure system. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that under the influence of low pressure area lying over south Madhya Pradesh and a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and adjoining parts of Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar witnessed light to moderate rainfall on Monday with thunderstorm and lightning. Heavy rainfall occurred at one or two places in West Champaran, East Champaran and Gopalganj. The maximum temperature in most of the districts, including Patna, declined by three notches on Monday. The IMD has issued orange alert for Tuesday and yellow alert for Tuesday and Wednesday. It has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Supaul and heavy rainfall at one or two places in Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Kishanganj, Araria and Purnia. Thunderstorm and lightning activities may occur at one or two places in Bihar. While an orange alert stipulates that authorities should be alert for extreme weather developments, the yellow alert suggets the authorities to be watchful. The Patna Meteorological (MeT) Centre said Parsa and Amnaur recorded 37.2mm rainfall, Jandaha 27.2mm, Tarari 26.4mm, Chandan 22.8mm, Bahadurganj 21mm, Triveni and Balmikinagar 18.4mm. “Under the influence of cyclonic circulation over the Gangetic West Bengal and neighbourhood, a fresh low pressure area has formed over West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and associated cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8km above mean sea level,” a weatherman said. A weather scientist at Patna MeT office said under the prevailing weather system and movement of easterly wind from the Bay of Bengal, the moisture level is increasing in the atmosphere leading to cloud formation. “It would trigger light to moderate rainfall at most places and isolated thunderstorm with a wind speed of up to 9-10km/hour in the next 24 hours,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/light-rain-likely-to-continue-today/articleshow/87118557.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||A laboratory where the young minds invent scientific models||PATNA: From robots to shoe souls which can generate energy, over hundreds of models have been made by students in a laboratory at Shrikrishna Science Centre (SKCC) here in five years. The lab, set up in 2016, has so far helped 300 children come up with interesting innovations. The mentor of this ‘innovation hub’, P Gaurav Kumar, said, “If children have any concept in their mind, they get in touch with us. After going through their concepts, we contact them. The children then work at the lab under the guidance of the experts.” Gaurav said though experts from different fields are available, children mostly complete the projects on their own. “If the young minds get stuck, we help them. However, they usually get help from their peer group. This is real education beyond books,” Gaurav added. The lab is equipped with basic facilities and remain open from 10am to 5.30pm every day. It also has a 3D printer. The other expenditures incurred by the children on making models are borne by the science centre. While Rs 800 is charged as the annual fee, many youngsters complete three to four projects in a year. For instance, Hari Om Shranam, a student of Class XI, has successfully made a blind eye model to help blind people, another model to help deaf and a shoe which can tap the energy generated during walk. Giving details of his various projects, Shranam said, “Blind eye model has an ultrasonic sensor device. It helps a blind person know if there is something ahead of him.” Asked about the shoe soul, he said, “We generate energy in various ways which can be used for different purposes. Energy generated while walking can be tapped with the help of shoe soul.” The amount spent on each model varies depending on the type of model and concept. For instance, an agro boat model was made at the cost of Rs 10,000 by Mohit, Shivam and Saksham before Covid-19 pandemic. Even CM Nitish Kumar had praised these three Class IX students for their innovative model which can help farmers know about the requirement of water in their fields. The blind eye model was made with an expenditure of Rs 5,000 initially. However, the second model was made at a cost of just Rs 1,600 as the expensive gadgets were replaced by low-cost ones. Several models made at this lab received awards at the World Robot Olympiad, National Science Congress and other competitions. Busy making a car model, Naman Agarwal, a Class V student, refused to go back home on day one and completed the model without any help. “I enjoy doing such things,” said Naman. Though mainly children from Class VI to MSc are enrolled at the lab, even younger kids like Naman who have a concept and passion are given the opportunity to realise their dreams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/a-laboratory-where-the-young-minds-invent-scientific-models/articleshow/87118628.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||FM, RBI keen to continue stimulus||MUMBAI: The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are on the same page on the issue of continuing pandemic-era stimulus. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in an interview to Bloomberg in New York that the stimulus will continue. “The emphasis on building health infrastructure will continue” and so will government spending on capital expenditure and infrastructure, she said. Meanwhile, the state of the economy report prepared by RBI staff led by deputy governor Michael Patra called on the need for continuing with policy support for a longer period to ensure a sustained and inclusive recovery. The simultaneous statements indicate that even as stock markets test new highs every week, neither the government nor the central bank is keen to take the punch bowl away. While globally there are concerns over inflation, the central bank is of the view that the outlook concerning prices has improved and the central bank is not keen on acting too early and causing damage to the economy. “Premature tightening could bring about the stagflation that all fear, quashing growth just as the economy is recovering. In an influential view, history is thick with examples of central banks under-doing it — underestimating the need for continuing stimulus,” the state of the economy report said. However, one issue where the government has not paid heed to the central bank is on easing fuel prices through a reduction in taxes. “The challenge I will face, and the teams are also watching in the ministry, is the way the fuel prices are leading to a big crest,” Sitharaman said. “This uncertainty is a big element for me,” Sitharaman said. The report published by the RBI said, “On inflation, the MPC’s call has turned out to be correct, with the softer than expected food prices providing the impetus for a further disinflation of the headline to a closer alignment with the target. On the other hand, the economy may be healing, but it is still digging out of one of the deepest contractions to hit any major economy.” Last month, in his policy statement, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das called for a reduction in taxes on petrol and diesel. “Efforts to contain cost-push pressures through a calibrated reversal of the indirect taxes on fuel could contribute to a more sustained lowering of inflation and an anchoring of inflation expectations,” Das said. On the disinvestment programme, Sitharaman said that the government is pushing to get the initial public offering of Life Insurance Corporation by next March and any delay won’t be due to a lack of political will. “We are pushing to have it done,” Sitharaman said. “The problem is not that we don’t want it or we are pussyfooting on it now, it is more a question of doing the due process,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-rbi-keen-to-continue-stimulus/articleshow/87120864.cms||---

Giving details of the proposal, PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary said the proposed buildings would be constructed on a plot of five acres of land lying between VC lodge at Patna College and Krishna Ghat at an estimated cost of Rs137 crore. The proposal has been sent in pursuance of the instructions from the education department, he said. While the new administrative block would replace the existing PU office, which has become quite old and dilapidated and fails to meet all the present-day requirements of the university. The new academic block is supposed to accommodate all the postgraduate departments of social sciences and humanities, which are presently located in the congested Darbhanga House complex. The new multistorey (G+7) blocks would solve the problem of space and ensure smooth conduct of various activities, the VC said. The space vacated in Darbhanga House complex after the shifting of PG departments to the new academic block would be allotted to Vanijya Mahavidyalaya, a full-fledged PU college, which has been functioning in a small annexe of Patna College since its inception in 1974. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary had recently ordered complete renovation of the historic Wheeler Senate House and asked PU to submit a detailed proposal for its expansion and growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-submits-rs137-cr-proposal-to-govt-for-new-administrative-building/articleshow/87118730.cms||B K Mishra
---||Business||RBI fines SBI, StanChart nearly Rs 3cr||Mumbai: The RBI has imposed a penalty on SBI and Standard Chartered Bank. SBI has been fined Rs 1 crore for non-compliance with RBI’s directions on frauds classification and reporting by commercial banks. StanChart has been fined Rs 1.95 crore for multiple offences. These include non-compliance with the directions issued by the RBI on limiting liability of customers in electronic transactions, on rules on cyber security framework, credit card operations and creation of a central repository of large common exposures (CRILC) across banks. In the case of SBI, the central bank found that in a customer account maintained with the public sector bank there was non-compliance with directions relating to reporting of fraud. StanChart’s inspections brought to light a cyber fraud where the bank failed to reverse the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transactions. The bank also did not report the cyber security incident within the prescribed period. Third, the bank had authorising the direct sales agents, an outsourced third party, to conduct KYC verification. The bank had also failed to ensure integrity and quality of data submitted in CRILC. Both banks were issued notices and after hearing their submissions, RBI concluded that the charges were substantiated and a fine was warranted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-fines-sbi-stanchart-nearly-rs-3cr/articleshow/87120905.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rojgar Bazaar 2.0: Delhi govt looks to refresh its job portal||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has floated a tender for developing Rojgar Bazaar 2.0 to transform its existing employment portal into a first-of-its-kind digital platform for job matching in the country. “Rojgar Bazaar 1.0 portal, launched in August 2020 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at the peak of Covid-19 pandemic, turned out to be a lifeline for the unemployed youth as well as small businesses of Delhi,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.  “Over 14 lakh job-seekers have used it and 10 lakh jobs have been advertised on the current portal. No other job-matching platform by any state government in India has been so successful. But we don’t want to stop here,” he added. The current tender was floated by the employment department of the Delhi government on October 14. Building on the success of Rojgar Bazaar 1.0, the new portal will provide artificial intelligence-based job matching services and end-to-end employment-related services to the youths of Delhi on a single platform. “The new Rojgar Bazaar 2.0 portal will bring all services related to skill training, career guidance and job matching on a first-of-its-kind digital platform in India,” Sisodia said. The new portal will bring in best practices from national and international job portals. “Rojgaar Bazaar 2.0 will be a first-of-its-kind innovative platform launched by any state government to provide all employment-related services seamlessly to its citizens,” an official said. As a substantial number of unorganised workers cannot access the digital platform on their own, the Delhi government will institutionalise physical centres to increase access to the platform and drive synergy with other ongoing social sector programmes. “In addition to AI-based smart-matching and employer verification for job-matching, the platform will also provide a range of other critical services,” the official added. “It will range from skilling, career guidance, skill credentialing to automated analytics services, all of which will help in enhancing the job-seekers’ ability to secure meaningful livelihoods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rojgar-bazaar-2-0-delhi-govt-looks-to-refresh-its-job-portal/articleshow/87121521.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||O2 deaths: As oppn slams govt, Goa health minister calls in 'sick'||PANAJI: The two-day winter session of the Goa legislative assembly — the last before the state goes to polls early next year — began on Monday with the opposition putting the government on the mat over the oxygen-related deaths at GMC. Health minister Vishwajit Rane was conspicious by his absence, with the Speaker saying he was “unwell”. With no health minister in the House, the opposition demanded that CM Pramod Sawant provide the answers, but to no avail, leading to several crucial questions on the May tragedy going unanswered as speaker Rajesh Patnekar adjourned the House till 12.30pm. “I request (that) members should not ask for information that is too detailed, as it ought to be collected, collated and given within a given time frame, ” said Patnekar in his ruling allowing the “postponement” sought by Rane, which was interrupted by opposition members, who refused to accept it. This happened minutes after the session began, and before question hour could even begin. Opposition members rushed to the well of the House over the issue. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat first raised objections, stating that they had not received a reply to the question on Covid deaths even though it was not postponed. He was joined by GFP MLA Vijai Sardesai and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte. The speaker said Rane had sought leave as he was “unwell”, and questions listed against his name were postponed on his request. “When a minister seeks postponement under rule 49 (2) of the rules of procedure and conduct of business on the ground that it is not possible to collect information within a time frame, (if) it is too detailed, I have to allow it,” Patnekar said. Khaunte said that in Rane’s absence, the CM can reply to health-related questions. “Why has the session been summoned if you don’t want to give answers?” asked Khaunte. Patnekar said it is an inherent right of the members of the House to seek information from the government while discharging duties. Earlier, questions about Covid deaths and Covid management, including postponed questions — listed to be answered in the ongoing session — about purchases made for the pandemic, on communidade land grabs and Mopa airport, were yet again deferred to the next session even as Sardesai, Khaunte and others objected. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said responses sought to some of the questions asked were voluminous, and the government needed time to collect information, and they were adjourned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/o2-deaths-as-oppn-slams-govt-health-min-calls-in-sick/articleshow/87122209.cms||Bindiya Chari

Senior BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya said that in January, a bank was appointed to pick up the coins and loose change from the 27 bus depots and deposit in BEST’s account. “It has been eight months and not a single coin has been taken from the depots. As a result, staffers continue to take cash as part of their salary and now the BEST has invited the public to take them in exchange for bigger notes,” Ganacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-swap-notes-for-loose-change-at-best-depots/articleshow/87123665.cms||Somit Sen

Police said that the two accused Gaurav Khinsuriya and Tejas Saretha stole the gold plate weighing 1kg from the machine owned by Himanshu Jogiya, a resident of Dhebar Road. Jogiya informed the cops that very few would know that there is a gold plate inside the machine. Also, only an expert or a person familiar with the gold plating work can remove the gold from the machine. Suspecting that an insider might have committed the theft, police questioned all current and past employees of Jogiya. Khinsuriya and Saretha, who worked for Jogiya and were removed from the job around a year ago, were also questioned. During the interrogation, the duo broke down and admitted that they had stolen the gold plate along with CCTV cameras, digital video recorder, computer, weighing scale and a pen drive. The duo had broken the lock on the machine and after removing the vacuum, stole the gold plate.

The decision was taken by the KMC Board of Administrators in the interests of citizens who would either need their second dose or want to get tested for Covid, said Atin Ghosh, a member of the KMC BOA overseeing the civic body’s health department. Earlier, the civic brass had decided to keep 90% of the urban primary health centres shut till October 25. However, since the Covid vaccination clinics are run from these health centres and citizens are dependent on them for getting tested for Covid, the civic authority has decided to reopen these units from Tuesday. According to Ghosh, the civic body will want the citizens to avail of the benefits of the ongoing vaccination drive from the civic clinics. The civic body will also request the public to take advantage of an RT-PCR test to determine the presence of the Covid infection in case they run a fever or suffer from Covid-like symptoms. “We have decided to reopen our clinics before schedule to enable the citizens to take advantage of our ongoing vaccination drive. The citizens should also take the opportunity to get themselves tested and treated if they run a fever or catch a cold. If our medical officers find Covid-like symptoms in their patients, they may refer them for a Covid test to be done at the earliest,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-cancels-leaves-to-run-all-its-jab-units-from-today/articleshow/87119328.cms||Saikat Ray

The top cop said that the volunteers should connect with women and girls in different pockets and localities with an objective to gain confidence and allow the victims to approach them at an early stage.“Police often do not get the entire gamut of the truth or facts from the victims as they don’t share their plight at the police station. These women group would help the investigation team to reach the depth of the issues and help cops in the probe,” she said.Singh also said the women groups would go to the schools and colleges to alert young girls about what constitutes a crime and how can they be reported.“It is important for minors to know the difference between the ‘Good touch’ and ‘Bad touch’. The teenagers need to know what constitute the crime,” said Singh adding that the women groups would be soon imparted basic training for handling cases and providing proper guidance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-sakinaka-amts-mahila-police-mitra-to-assist-sexual-assault-victims/articleshow/87116800.cms||Soumitra Bose

The way BJP is misusing central agencies and targetting various leaders, will backfire politically.” Being in Nagpur, Bhujbal made sure that he brought leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis in the conversation. “I think Devendra (Fadnavis) is a wise man and he must now think about what his party is doing. It’s time to introspect as to how Maharashtra is viewing this. Do you think by doing all this, the image of BJP will improve,” asked Bhujbal. He said the BJP will take a beating because central agencies are not only targetting political opponents. “Now they are going after relatives of political leaders, to pressure them indirectly. They want to destabilize the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and that’s why all this is happening,” said Bhujbal. He said that in India’s post-Independence history, “never has such a thing happened.” Reacting to a statement from the BJP camp that MVA ministers won’t even realize when the government will fall, Bhujbal shot back with a sarcastic take on Fadnavis’s short-lived attempt of forming the government. “We realize everything that you are planning...and we take corrective measures too. So even if a government is formed early in the morning, we took the necessary steps to rectify the situation,” said Bhujbal.When asked about allegations of nexus between traders and ration shop owners to siphon off supplies, Bhujbal said investigations will bring out the truth. “I have already received that information and we won’t spare those found guilty in this. In fact, we have requested for an appointment of IG-level police official to look into this. This request has been sent to both the chief minister and home minister,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/misuse-of-central-agencies-will-backfire-on-bjp-bhujbal/articleshow/87116833.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The Selvapuram police have recovered the stolen properties from him while he was trying to sell them. A police officer identified the accused as Selvaraj, a native of Goripalayam in Madurai district. A loadman, he had been residing along with his family at Telungupalayam in the city. The officer said a special team led by sub-inspector Marimuthu had found Selvaraj roaming at Town Hall in a suspicious manner on Sunday evening. The team picked him up for inquiry and checked his bag. “They found gold and silver ornaments in his bag. He told them that the bag was found on a road at Selvapuram and he was planning to sell the ornaments on Raja Street.” Meanwhile, the team verified the details of Selvaraj and came to know he was involved in a burglary at Amul Nagar at Selvapuram on October 14. “He had broken into the house of 64-year-old goldsmith P Varadharajan when the house owner and other family members were away at some place.” The Selvapuram police subsequently arrested Selvaraj on Sunday evening and he was later remanded in judicial custody. The officer said Selvaraj was lodged in Sathyamangalam sub-jail for breaking into the house of 58-year-old J Saravana Ashokkumar, a motorcycle mechanic from LIC Colony, on September 15 and decamping with gold ornaments weighing 20 sovereigns. In that case also, he was arrested by the Selvapuram police. “He was granted bail in the case 10 days ago with a condition to put his signature at Selvapuram police station daily until further orders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/burglar-on-bail-breaks-into-a-house-at-selvapuram-steal-gold-arrested/articleshow/87121610.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Festive season brings international acclaim for Bengal film-makers||Kolkata: The festive season has ushered in critical acclaim abroad for film-makers from Bengal dealing with sensitive subjects, like rape and religious intolerance. The first big news came from South Korea, where director Aparna Sen’s Hindi film ‘The Rapist’ was declared a co-winner of the Kim Jiseok award at the 26th Busan International Film Festival. The next cause for celebration was the overwhelming response at the BFI London Film Festival to Prasun Chatterjee’s debut Bengali film ‘Dostojee’ on how childhood camaraderie is threatened in a climate of fast-spreading religious intolerance in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition and the Mumbai blasts. Sen’s film, starring Konkona Sen Sharma, Arjun Rampal and Tanmay Dhanania, is a portrait of sexual violence, its aftermath, and the socio-psychological fallout for both survivors and perpetrators. The film had its world premiere at BIFF 2021 in the ‘A Window on Asian Cinema’ section and was one of seven films nominated for the award. It deals with themes of crime, punishment and restorative justice through the prism of class dynamics while chronicling the journey of three protagonists and how their lives get entwined because of one incident. “This award has a special significance for me because I was in Busan as a jury member many years ago,” said Sen. “Deeply humbled, grateful and overwhelmed” with the decision, Sen mentioned she had met Kim and is aware of his tireless efforts to promote Asian cinema throughout the world. Konkona Sen Sharma in a still from 'The Rapist'Meanwhile, on Panchami, Saptami and Nabami, London hosted multiple screenings of ‘Dostojee’. The film explores how the lives of two school kids — one a Hindu and the other, a Muslim — and the social fabric in a remote Bengal village change due to growing religious intolerance. Although set in 1993, ‘Dostojee’ strongly reflects contemporary realities. “Unlike Kolkata, cinemas in London allow 100% occupancy. I am overwhelmed by the queue at the box-office, the sold-out shows and the way the British audience reacted to my film,” Chatterjee said. A still from 'Dostojee'Before the screening, he met Iranian director Asgarh Farhadi, who has received two Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film for ‘A Separation’ and ‘The Salesman’. Farhadi’s ‘A Hero’ was also screened at the festival. “I couldn’t believe I got the opportunity to discuss with him the process of film-making, writing and briefing actors. The protagonists of my film are child actors and I suppose that was one of the reasons for his interest in discussing cinema with me. Though he couldn’t watch my film because he had another conference, he took along my film’s kit with him,” Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/festive-season-brings-international-acclaim-for-bengal-film-makers/articleshow/87119373.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Plastic was being regularly dumped at the sanctuary and the natural nullah was slowly being covered by the debris. Meghana Baphna, a resident, said that the sanctuary is under threat. “Just like we are putting in so much effort in collecting different types of trash including construction waste and plastic, this needs attention too. This is going to cause flooding in Kalyaninagar. When will the government invest in taking care of the flooding problem. This source of flooding needs to be stopped.” Citizens noticed the debris dumping during the morning walks and are now planning a silent sit-in in front of the sanctuary over the weekend if the construction debris was not cleared. Biren Bhatt, another resident of Kalyaninagar, said, “The incident of construction debris is not new and in the past too similar incidents have been reported. The sanctuary, which is of great importance because of the birds it attracts, needs critical care. Immediate action needs to be taken against those spoiling the sanctity of the sanctuary.” In the past, around 2018, the residents had also protested over the tree-cutting at the sanctuary. Before the lockdown, the residents would conduct cleanliness drives almost every Sunday to protect the environment and keep it away from illegal activities. Kamlesh Sharma, a resident of Kalyaninagar, said that during lockdown nobody could go for the cleanliness drive and just about one or two months since things opened up, the debris dumping started which is disturbing the river bank, creating pollution and most importantly driving away the birds.” Ward officer Suresh Jagtap, said, “We have received complaints from the residents and we will be arranging an inspection drive at the sanctuary soon with the respective officials. Action against those who are dumping the debris will be taken immediately.” Purnima Joshi, another Kalyaninagar resident, said there is no system for the construction industry to dispose of waste. “The easiest place is along the rivers. The sanctuary has been a haven, for birds. Over the past few years, its space has shrunk and it faces a serious threat. All citizens must focus on our natural heritage, reclaim and take care of it,,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/debris-dumping-at-salim-ali-bird-park-blocks-nullah-flow/articleshow/87119386.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

A stranger approached the man and said he would be able to help him get a mini statement from the ATM,” he said. The unsuspecting complainant accompanied the man to the ATM kiosk. “He gave his debit card and shared its PIN,” the officer said. He said the man printed the mini-statement and returned the card to the complainant. “On Friday, the senior citizen received SMS alerts about the withdrawal of Rs 60,000 from his bank account,” the officer said. The elderly man then checked his debit card and was shocked to see it was someone else’s. “He realised the stranger at bank had swapped the cards,” the officer said. The officer said they have collected CCTV footage from the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/77-year-old-takes-help-from-stranger-at-atm-loses-rs-60k/articleshow/87119429.cms||---

In non-notified slums, around 44% of households use bottled water for drinking purposes. TimesViewIf 44% in slums are drinking bottled water, it is not because they want to but because they have no other option. The government must invest in providing safe drinking water to the city’s disadvantaged.This was revealed through a sample survey done by Directorate of Economics and Statistics of Delhi government between July and December 2018. While around 76% of households used piped water, 7.5% used tubewells, 7% bottled water, 3.8% public taps, 3.3% tankers and 0.1% were dependent upon private tankers. Drinking water packaged in bottles, jars, pouches and other containers were sold by different brands. Non-branded bottled water was also available. Generally, this packaged drinking water meets certain safety standards. The release of the report was delayed because after the samples were collected, comparison of multiple parameters was required at the national level. Later, the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the delay. An official who was a part of the survey said many households with piped drinking water connections were also found using bottled water for drinking purposes over concerns of purity. “Tap water, well water, etc kept by households in bottles for convenience was not treated as bottled drinking water,” added the official. Many households were still dependent on tankers for drinking water despite a growth in the pipeline network. The issue of tankers has been fuelling politics in the capital for a long time. It’s not uncommon to find people scampering to get water from tankers, especially during summer. Only 58.8% of households used electric purifiers and 29.4% did not use any treatment for drinking water. Nearly 10% of households used non-electric purifiers, 0.9% used the boiling method and 0.1% used cloth for filtering water. While 71% of households were connected to the piped sewer system, 28.5% were using septic tanks, 0.4% had a “flush to elsewhere” system, and 0.1% did not have access to any latrine. However, on all parameters, Delhi was far ahead of the country. As a large number of households used septic tanks, it indicated that many areas, including unauthorised ones, were yet to be connected to the piped sewer system. The findings also indicated that Delhi was yet to completely eliminate open defecation. An official said the survey on housing conditions was aimed to portray several aspects, including infrastructure facilities like electricity, bathroom, drinking water, sewerage, drainage, garbage disposal, ventilation, among others.  A reference period of 365 days was used for household characteristics, living facilities, micro-environment, general particulars, etc. However, for items like rent, consumer expenditure, etc, the reference period was 30 days. While 69.5% of dwelling units were self-owned, 27.6% were rented. The average floor area of dwelling units was 51.7 sqm and the average monthly rent was Rs 5,317. The average floor area of dwelling units in the country was 46.4 sqm and the average monthly rent was Rs 3,056. It is expected that the survey findings would be useful for planners, policymakers and researchers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-75-of-households-have-piped-drinking-water-in-delhi/articleshow/87121690.cms||AlokKNMishra

Pointing out that the city used to generate an average of 800 to 850 tonnes waste daily, a city corporation official said the streets were filled with waste during the puja festival and they had collected 941 tonnes waste on Thursday, 833 tonnes on Friday and 907 tonnes on Saturday. He said they had collected just 444 tonnes waste on Sunday, when they work with a lean workforce. A city health official confirmed that the corporation had collected around 170 tonnes more waste during the puja days. “The waste that we couldn’t collect on Sunday was collected on Monday, shooting up the day’s volume. The quantity of waste collected today (Monday) will be collated only tomorrow (Tuesday).” City deputy corporation commissioner Dr M Sharmila said the entire workforce had swung into action to clean the city streets, which resembled dump yards during the puja celebrations, without any reservations. “At markets, traders had left behind a large quantity of unsold banana shoots. We managed the waste by effectively making use of the waste collection centres in the city.” She said there was a mechanism in place in the city to clear the waste without prodding sanitary workers much. “One of our focus areas is improving the city’s cleanliness.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-generates-170t-excess-waste-during-puja-festival/articleshow/87121626.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Traders encroach footpaths as corpn remains mute spectator||Coimbatore: Traders have encroached on the pedestrian pathways on Dr Nanjappa Road, forcing the general public to use the carriage way, where they face the threat of being hit by fast moving vehicles. An important commercial hub that is famous for water pumps, the stretch draws several hundred shoppers a day from various places in the district, other districts in the state and neighbouring Kerala. Road users said the stretch between Avinashi Road and Park Gate Road Junction was always congested. Traders have put their products on display on the footpath to attract customers, leaving little space for pedestrians, said a road user. While the road, which comes with a median, is wide enough, parking on both sides often leads to traffic snarls on the stretch. And pedestrians have no other option but to negotiate the busy road. S Vijayalaksmi, a pedestrian, said they didn’t feel safe to walk on the carriage way. “We have to walk with the constant fear of being hit by vehicles. I feel unsafe every time walking on the road.” V Senthilvel, a commuter from Avarampalayam, said the pedestrians on the carriage way were a threat to them as well. “They also hinder vehicular movement. By regulating parking on both sides of the road, authorities can make more room for vehicles. Double parking is a common sight on the stretch.” Activists, meanwhile, urged the city corporation to take stern action against the illegal parking and encroachment of pedestrian pathway on the stretch. They said while the hawkers were evicted from Dr Nanjappa Road recently, the corporation hadn’t done anything to streamline the traders. When contacted, a corporation official said they would carry out a drive to free pedestrian pathways of traders. “We have received similar complaints about other commercial areas. We will take strict action against such traders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/traders-encroach-footpaths-as-corpn-remains-mute-spectator/articleshow/87121661.cms||V Devanathan

Gawali had failed to appear on being summoned earlier on October 4, and had sought two weeks’ exemption. On Monday, the ED issued a second summons for her appearance on Wednesday.  The ED investigation is based on a complaint originally filed by the MP against the former office-bearers of her trust (Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan), accusing them of cheating. The police, however, suspect that Gawali, her close associate Saeed Khan, and others criminally conspired to convert her trust into a non-profit through forgery and fraud, siphoned off money and then filed a false case against the former office-bearers. Khan was arrested earlier. The ED came across suspicious transactions at least two instances of alleged kickbacks camouflaged as payments for government contracts through Khan. In one instance, Khan’s company got a government contract to distribute food items among tribals, and in another, his company also got a sub-contract for road work. Khan’s companies received Rs 10 crore and Rs 5 crore for executing these projects respectively, but he was unable to provide details of those works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-summons-sena-mp-gawali-again-on-oct-20/articleshow/87121759.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Pune||Fines fail to deter speeding on eway, fatalities continue||Pune: The death of three men in an accident involving six vehicles near the Khopoli exit of the Pune-Mumbai Expressway on Monday morning has once again raised concerns over motorists’ tendency to speed beyond the set limits. Till September, as many as 65 people have lost their lives this year in accidents on the expressway. Police said speeding beyond limits had been the most common cause of the accidents. Police said speeding was also the cause of the accident on Monday. Since January, Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) officials from Thane and Pune units have penalized 3.97 lakh motorists on the charge of violating speed limits on the expressway (see graphic). Light motor vehicles and heavy vehicles are supposed to maintain a speed limit of less than 100kmph and 80kmph, respectively. Last year, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, in association with NGO Save Life Foundation, installed static cameras covering all the lanes of the expressway. Despite all such measures, speeding beyond limits remains a major challenge for the authorities. Additional director general of police (traffic) Bhushankumar Upadhyay told TOI, “Over-speeding has been singularly identified as the most common cause of the ghastly accidents on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. We have deployed four interceptor vehicles and installed high speed monitoring cameras on the expressway.” He added, “We are continuously penalizing the offending motorists. Yet, the motorists are violating the speed limits and risking lives. Many buses and heavy vehicles are involved in over-speeding, which is a big worry. The police are trying to keep a check on them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fines-fail-to-deter-speeding-on-eway-fatalities-continue/articleshow/87119446.cms||---

Her treating eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar, who restored her vision using the frozen umbilical cord tissue, bagged the coveted Rhett Buckler award given by the American Society of Retinal Surgeons (ASRS) to the best surgical skill video at the 39th ASRS meet at San Antonio , the US, on October 15. The award is considered an 'Oscar' in showcasing surgical techniques and innovations in treating retinal conditions. The video judged 'the best of the show' in the ASRS's meet is shared with eye surgeons/retinal specialists on various national and international forums. The winning film gets an impressive 8-pound, 24-carat-gold-plated statuette custom sculpted by RS Owens & Company in Chicago — the manufacturer of Oscar awards. “I won the Rhett Buckler award for the second time consecutively. This year, it was more special as our video bagged the ‘the best of the show’ award too,” Kelkar, the medical director of Pune-based National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO), said. Kelkar chose to present the challenging surgical case of Akshita, who suffered from recurrent optic disc pit maculopathy. “We treated Akshita's retinal condition using an amniotic membrane graft. The retinal hole was filled using a 3mm tissue drawn from the innermost part of placenta,” he said. “We modified our technique by using a larger graft. We also used intra operative optical coherence tomography so that we could obviate the need of additional laser to retina or additional tamponade like silicone oil or gas. This allowed the child to regain the vision within 48 hours,” Kelkar said. In 2020, Kelkar had received the same award for the first time for a video showcasing the surgery for Marfan syndrome that has dislocated cataract and retinal detachment. “This year, our video was also bestowed with the best of the show award,” he said. The video was prepared by Kelkar along with eye surgeon Mounika Bolshetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-based-eye-surgeon-bags-rhett-buckler-award/articleshow/87119436.cms||Umesh Isalkar

They have demanded that the civic body address the cost escalation and other concerns raised by citizens. They have also demanded answers to questions raised by the public about construction along the riverside. The activists and environmentalist were speaking at a press conference here on Monday. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said that administration must come up clean on the project. “The cost escalation in the project is sizeable. This should be explained to citizens,” he said. As per the activists, the project cost is going to rise from Rs2,300crore to Rs4,200crore. “The DPR of the project states that construction will be carried out along the riverside. This is going to harm the natural flow of river,” said Sarang Yadwadkar, an environmentalist. The standing committee of the PMC gave a green signal to the project earlier this month. “The tender process for the same will start soon,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the committee. As per the data, 62 hectares of free land would be used for setting up public amenities. Gardens and playground have been planned. Around 79% of the area would be developed with green initiative, while 21% would be for carrying out engineering work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/concern-over-civic-bodys-riverfront-project-work/articleshow/87119418.cms||---

---||Ajmer||Rajasthan: Against target of 32,000, 1,000 lease deeds issued||JAIPUR: The tall claims of Rajasthan government have fallen flat as urban local bodies have so far issued 1,011 lease deeds (pattas) to old settlements till October 14 under section 69A of the Municipalities Act, against a target of 32,000, which is only 3.15 per cent. Terming the section 69A of the Act ‘magical and game-changer’ in issuing lease deeds to old settlements under its ambitious ‘Prashasan Shehron ke Sang’ campaign, state government had set a target to issue 70% of the total lease deeds by using the section 69A. The government had set a target of issuing 5 to 7 lakh lease deeds under the section out of total 10 lakh lease deeds. The urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal had in June this year termed the section 69A ‘magical and game-changer’ for the campaign to issue lease deeds to old settlements and Walled City areas. The state has 213 urban local bodies, including 10 municipal corporations in seven major cities of the state. These cities include Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur, Ajmer, Bharatpur and Bikaner. Presently, nine municipal corporations have issued 934 lease deeds in 13 days under the campaign, including only 26 lease deeds in old settlement areas. Municipal corporations in Ajmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur North, Jodhpur South, Kota North and Kota South have not issued a single lease deed in old settlement areas. Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Heritage has issued maximum of 21 lease deeds, whereas Bharatpur Municipal Corporation and Jaipur Greater Corporation have issued four and one lease deed respectively. Municipal corporations across the state have so far received 1,536 applications under the section 69A. Before the campaign, the UDH also majorly emphasised to provide lease deeds in old areas of the Walled City. An official said that, as the well-known cities and towns in Rajasthan came up during the erstwhile princely states and some of the towns are centuries-old, around 35 to 40 lakh residents living in these areas do not have lease deeds. However, the local bodies have so far failed to serve the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/against-target-of-32k-1k-lease-deeds-issued/articleshow/87133293.cms||---
---||Pune||Police plan to use lie detector, narco tests on duo in techie’s murder case||Pune: The city police are considering the option of subjecting the two men held on the charge of murdering their techie friend in Kondhwa recently to scientific tests such as lie detector, narco analysis and brain mapping for extracting the truth as the duo have so far maintained innocence after the initial custodial interrogation. Techie Ganesh Tarlekar (47) was found dead, with two bullet wounds, in his flat at a housing society in Kondhwa Budruk on the evening of October 11. Two days later, the police arrested his two friends, Sagar Binavat (33) and Dattatraya Hajare (47), on the suspicion of murdering him, as they were last accompanying the techie at the time of his death and had also admitted to have dumped a country-made pistol in a well at Yeolewadi.  An officer said the duo had claimed that Tarlekar shot himself dead and they feared police action. Despite custodial interrogation, Binavat and Hajare have so far maintained that they did not kill Tarlekar but only dumped the firearm out of fear. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI on Monday, “The scientific tests, if done, will help the police understand the conduct of the accused before and after the murder and also whether they have provided true or false information, among other issues.” She said, “The murder motive is still not clear. Similarly, the source of the firearms is also not clear. The duo has so far maintained that they did not kill the techie, but actually tried to save him from shooting himself. We are exploring various possibilities to establish the source of the country-made pistol dumped by the suspects in a well at Yeolewadi. The ballistic expert report of the firearm is awaited.” A retired public prosecutor said, “As per the Supreme Court ruling, the police will have to seek permission of a magisterial court if it intends to subject the suspects to scientific tests.The The court will give permission to police if the suspects voluntarily give consent to undergo such tests. The tests cannot be conducted if the accused refuses to give consent before the court.” The Pune cantonment court extended the police custody remand of the two suspects till Tuesday after their initial custody ended on Sunday.  Inspector (crime) Jagannath Jankar from the Kondhwa police is investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-plan-to-use-lie-detector-narco-tests-on-duo-in-techies-murder-case/articleshow/87119444.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The incident took place when three workers had gone to attend to a complaint of a choked drainage line in the locality. They had taken the jetting machine of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). Chintak Parmar, general secretary of the Vadodara Nadia Samaj (VNS) to which the workers belonged, said reason for the assault was that the residents were insisting on cleaning other lines in the area too “Two of the three workers were beaten up, There is CCTV footage of the violence,” said Parmar. “The other lines were empty at this time. If a jetting machine is used inside empty lines, it can lead to damage,” said Parmar. He said that a local shopkeeper who had tried to help the workers was also beaten up by the mob. Representatives of VNS submitted a memorandum to the social justice department too. A mob also made representations to the police regarding the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sanitation-workers-beaten-up/articleshow/87119451.cms||---
---||Pune||Security guards often encounter more rule breakers than followers||Pune: More often than not, Abdul Ghafoor, a security guard at an NIBM Road housing society, has encountered impatient or rude visitors and, at times, relatives of society residents, for doing his job when asks them who they are visiting. Ghafoor recalls, “A few days ago, a man wanted to visit someone who did not live in our society any more. When I informed him that there was no one by the name he was referring to, he got angry and lashed out at me, hurling abuses and threats. I kept my calm as it was my duty to ask him these queries at the gate.” Most security guards express their helplessness when guests are needlessly reluctant to give us their details or tell them which flat they want to go to, or put down their correct details or part with phone numbers. “We don’t want these details for our personal knowledge, but we need to ask questions to make an entry in the log book. Moreover, in the last 18 months, with the society managements giving specific pandemic-related instructions, there has been a lot of friction between residents and security guards,” Ghafoor said. Like Ghafoor, there are several other security guards who have similar experience to narrate. In case of a reprimand by a resident, the same becomes a put off for the guard. There are other issues like the residents asking guards to do non-security works like bringing vegetables, laundry, and sundry shopping too. All this raises the question as to how seriously society residents take the security aspect and what approach they adopt towards society security guards. Jaswa Musahar, a security guard in a Balewadi housing society, said, “When we enforce the society management’s instructions like not allowing delivery agents to move in and asking residents to collect parcels from the security cabin, closing the gates during curfew timing, asking them not to walk their pets on the premises, checking their temperatures at the entrance, not allowing residents gather in common areas __ people come and fight with us and then complain that we misbehaved or were rude.” Sometimes, the management gives raps them on the knuckles just to show the residents that they took action, but they actually understand their situation. Sometimes, by their own admission, it is their fault especially with newly appointed guards do not know the residents, some said. Suhas Patwardhan, resident of Pune District Cooperative Housing Federation, “Many societies have had the same security guards for a long time, so residents treat them like family members. During the pandemic, residents were totally dependent on security guards for a number of chores such as delivering parcels from the main gate to the residents’ doors, checking temperatures of everyone entering the society, supervising the sanitisation of the premises and sometimes even helping out with it, and so on.” But even with additional responsibilities, there has been little or no increase in their salaries. Training by home guard department Sachin More, chairman of Police-Private Security Partnership Programme (P4), an umbrella body of 200 private security agencies, said as of now, only five agencies in Pune have the licence to provide security personnel equipped with firearms. “However, hiring these guards is costly. The state home guard department provides training to the security guards hired by the private security agencies. However, after receiving the initial training from the home guard department, many agencies do not send them back for training or neglect their physical fitness due to the workload,” he added. Vishal Koyate, an administrator with the RV Group Security Services, said they provide training based on the requirement of clients. “Housing societies don't want to employ guards who are too old to do the job or too young with not enough experience. They require guards from a specific age group of 30-40 years,” he added. A security and management facility in Undri said that a special officer is brought in for training security guards to use and keep a firearm. “While most housing societies do not require their security guards to carry firearms, some demand it. We provide it in areas where it is allowed,” he said. Security guards, who need to carry firearms undergo a training course conducted by hired retired police personnel and receive a certificate after they have passed evaluation. “The company applies for a licence for the firearm, not individual employees. If questioned, the guards can show their ID cards,” an official at the facility said. Lynx Security Services, which operates in Maharashtra and Karnataka, claims to provide 160 hours of training to its guards, as required under PSARA, before deployment. “With unpredictable situations, the guards are required to gain some basic knowledge on how to react to emergency situations. With about 5 million people in the security industry, 1.3 million more than India’s police and armed forces combined, formal training to the security guards has only recently gained focus,” a company official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/security-guards-often-encounter-more-rule-breakers-than-followers/articleshow/87119459.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Heritage has issued maximum of 21 lease deeds, whereas Bharatpur Municipal Corporation and Jaipur Greater Corporation have issued four and one lease deed respectively. Municipal corporations across the state have so far received 1,536 applications under the section 69A. Before the campaign, the UDH also majorly emphasised to provide lease deeds in old areas of the Walled City. An official said that, as the well-known cities and towns in Rajasthan came up during the erstwhile princely states and some of the towns are centuries-old, around 35 to 40 lakh residents living in these areas do not have lease deeds. However, the local bodies have so far failed to serve the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/against-target-of-32k-1k-lease-deeds-issued/articleshow/87133291.cms||---

A group of researchers from Shri Shiv Chhatrapati College, Junnar, in collaboration with Department of Technology, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (C-MET), and other institutes made this discovery. The researchers have tested these silver nanoparticles and found them effective for fungal infection, anti-microbial activity in human body or to avoid injury scars. They also investigated its anti-cancer activity against cervical cancer cells. The research has been published in Nature Journal in September. The researchers have now applied for a patent for their work. Ravindra Chaudhari from the department of zoology and Research Centre, Shri Shiv Chhatrapati College of Arts, Commerce and Science, Junnar, said, “Hyaluronic acid in the mucus has moisturizing properties while glycolic acid helps to stimulate collagen responsible for skin-glow and radiant complexion. Snail mucus is an important ingredient of several cosmetic and para-pharmaceutical products. The main ingredients of snail mucus (proteins, amino acids etc.) can contribute in bio-reduction and bio-stabilization steps involved in metallic nanoparticles synthesis,” he added. In a pilot attempt the research said, silver nanoparticles in biocompatible mucus exhibited anti-cancer activity against cervical cancer cell lines, said scientist Pramod Mane from the Junnar-based college. “From the standpoint of future therapeutic applications based on our primary investigations, we put forward the possibility of realizing silver nanoparticles based topical cream/gel for effective acne treatment as well as for rapid wound healing without leaving scars. Such an idea can probably be extended to formulate anti-cancer cream or gel for specific topical application,” he added. As compared to bacterial diseases, fungi mediated diseases are tedious to control, because very few antifungal drugs are available. Hence the need to formulate cost effective, eco-friendly and biocompatible antifungal agents. Sanjay Kale, chairman of Junnar Taluka Shivner Shikshan Prasarak Mandal and Agricultural Produce Market Committee in Junnar said, “Use of live organisms to obtain their body secretions is far more advantageous over the use of plants, as the organism is not sacrifced and safely returned to nature resulting in biodiversity conservation. It can be a great success when exploited commercially.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/silver-nanoparticles-produced-with-snail-mucus-can-heal-fungal-infection/articleshow/87119500.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Experts from various colleges, universities and scientific institutes will act as their trainers. Ajit Kembhavi, principal investigator of PKC, said the results of the survey were analysed and a module was designed jointly by PKC and DIET to mitigate the learning gaps. “This training programme and module consists of 12 sessions, with a weekly session of one and a half hours. The session is in an online format and the first lecture was on Monday,” he said. “Shobha Khandare, principal of DIET along with PKC, then compiled the results and found that there were some 12 broad tough topics which will be taught in these 12 sessions,” Pasalkar said. Sarika Dhamale, who teaches science to Std VIII students at Sarsenapati Haibatrao Shilimkar PMC number 1G Bibvewadi said such sessions help teachers understand more new methods to teach the same topic. “It is quite possible that I may be teaching a topic in a way that is hard for students to understand. Such sessions help us know more about the topic as well as ways to teach them. If there are simpler ways to teach a concept, any teacher will adopt that,” she said. These sessions help the teacher understand the various ways a concept can be easily explained, whether through a video or a PowerPoint presentation. It also helps devise simple activities for students while teaching, Siddharth Sonawane, a science teacher at PMC school number 49 B Ramwadi, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-month-course-for-teachers-to-better-explain-science/articleshow/87119468.cms||Ardhra Nair

Commuters faced a harrowing time, as most of them were unaware about it. The worst hit were the passengers aboard trains stopped at the railway station till the evening. Though the agitation was from 10am to 4pm, the trains in transit were able to leave the stations only after the railway authorities ensured the tracks were clear. In the morning, dozens of protesters stormed Ludhiana railway station and sat on the tracks with flags of farmer unions. Addressing the protesters, a farm union leader said, “The heinous killing of four innocent farmers and a journalist at Lakhimpur Kheri has shocked the entire country. This was a planned murder of peacefully protesting farmers and an attempt to scare the millions of other farmers to stop their agitation. Though son of Union minister Ajay Mishra has been arrested, Mishra, who too is responsible for the killings, should also be removed from his post and arrested so that a fair inquiry can be conducted.”A woman passenger aboard Mumbai-bound Paschim Express, which was halted at the Ludhiana railway station, said, “If we knew about the ‘rail roko’ protest, we would have cancelled our plan to travel to Faridabad. Common man should not be made to suffer like this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/several-trains-cancelled-short-terminated/articleshow/87117053.cms||---
---||Pune||Cops experiment with dedicated parking slots on Salunke Vihar Road||Pune: The city traffic police have embarked on a fortnight-long experiment under which there would be dedicated two- and four-wheeler parking lots and a ban on parking at certain spots on Salunke Vihar Road in Kondhwa. The traffic police issued a notification to this effect and invited public feedback. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame signed the notification covering the 1.5km stretch on October 10; it was issued on October 14 and urges citizens to provide feedback by October 25. The traffic police will then take a call on making the system official. “We have received several complaints from the public related to bottlenecks caused by double-parking, roadside encroachments, congestion caused by vegetable vendors, customers visiting banks/shops and traffic snarls at the chaotic ABC farm Chowk on Salunke Vihar Road. The stretch between Salunke Vihar housing society and Kamela Chowk is under the scanner,” assistant inspector Lekhaji Shinde, the in-charge of Kondhwa traffic police, said. Shinde said they studied the stretch for two weeks and tried to assess why bottlenecks were created during peak and non-peak hours. “We then initiated a proposal to introduce the system to decongest the road,” Shinde said. “We have been fining vendors Rs500 each under sections 102 and 103 of the Maharashtra Police Act, but to no avail. We have sent a letter to the civic authorities to shift the vendors to the newly built vegetable market on Salunke Vihar Road in decongest the road,” he added. “We have constructed a concrete road and pedestrian-friendly pavements, but the place is encroached upon by hawkers. Customers coming out for shopping are forced to walk on the road and park their vehicles in a haphazard manner. Minor accidents are common,” local corporator Nanda Lonkar told TOI. Lonkar said a white line will be drawn at places earmarked for the parking lots. “We will install P1/P2 signboards if required. Plans are on the cards to set up medians to streamline traffic flow. The hawkers will be shifted to the civic body vegetable market at the earlies,” Lonkar said. Maithili Manakawad, secretary of the Wanowrie Housing Residents’ Association, said hawkers occupy public space even though Salunke Vihar Road is a no-hawking zone. “We want PMC/police to first relocate hawkers and remove encroachments before launching the parking system. Otherwise, the system’s purpose would be defeated. We want police to launch a P1/P2 system, convert the stretch between ABC Farm Chowk to Wanowrie circle a one-way road and ban heavy vehicles,” Manakawad said. Local resident Sanjay Mane said, “If the P1/P2 system is launched, then one side of Salunke Vihar Road will become free of traffic and curb hawkers. Problems related to reckless overtaking will be solved if the civic body installs medians.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-experiment-with-dedicated-parking-slots-on-salunke-vihar-road/articleshow/87119503.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Mumbai||MNS man among 5 booked for cheating home buyer||MUMBAI: The Rafi Ahmed Kidwai (RAK) Marg police have booked Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Rajan Shirodkar, his son Aditya, who recently joined Shiv Sena, and three partners of Matoshree Infrastructure for allegedly cheating a flat buyer. They are accused of failing to hand over possession of the flat to the complainant, former inspector Dhananjay Daund. Rajan, Aditya, Ashutosh Abhaykar and partners Vijay Yevlekar, Suresh Gupta and Praful Mehta of Matoshree Infrastructure were named in the complaint. Rajan denied the allegations against him and his company directors. Police said Daund had booked a flat in the under-construction Landmark Tower at Dr G D Ambekar Marg at Dadar in 2015. The project was to be completed in May 2017. Daund claimed he paid 90% of the amount, and the remaining was to be paid at the time of possession. He alleged that the tower did not have the mandatory occupation certificate (OC) but the developer allowed flat buyers to take possession of flats. Shirodkar said, “The OC is pending because of BMC’s finance department. Once it gives us the final figure for payment and issues a challan, we will make the payment. There was also a delay in handing over possession on time for various reasons, including change in government policies and getting building permission. Police recorded my statement which gives reasons for the delay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mns-man-among-5-booked-for-cheating-home-buyer/articleshow/87123714.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Goa||Master of line work, Vamona Navelcar passes away at 91||PANAJI: The last couple of years of his life, Vamona Anant Sinai Navelcar had to live with poor hearing and could barely speak. But a few months until his death, at the age of 91, Navelcar did not give up drawing. On Monday, Navelcar breathed his last due to a heart ailment, having spent some time on life support in a private hospital in Dona Paula. His last rites were performed around 12noon the same day. Some years before his health began deteriorating, Navelcar scribbled in his notebook, “Physical strength due to age may become a certain sort of hurdle, but the mind overcomes all the negative impacts on one’s emotion. The mind demands and the creator fulfils his emotions and creativity”. His artworks are part of private and public collections across nearly every major city in the world, but Navelcar felt he was at his creative best in his dimly-lit room in his family’s ancestral home in Pomburpa. With his fluid line drawings, Navelcar captured the imagination of the art world from Asia to Europe to Africa since the early 1960s. “He spent a large part of his life in Portugal and Mozambique, and when he returned to Goa, the artist community was not as big as it is today. And he felt he was not accepted, even though in the end he was very loved by everyone,” said artist Yolanda de Souza. It is possibly about this feeling of aloofness, Navelcar wrote, “Lobby! I haven’t had this type of bulldozers to push me forward in art. I need to march forward on my own initiative”. It was De Souza who offered Navelcar his first solo show in Goa. “He had his first solo show in the early 2000s in Goa at my gallery, and I put up his works on our website, and his students from Portugal and Mozambique contacted me and bought his works. His students loved him so much. One woman came to Goa from Portugal and bought his works. He did not have to do much, his works made him very loved,” she said. Christ was a recurring theme in his paintings, which made Navelcar the only Indian artist to have painted such varied interpretations of The Last Supper. Despite recognition the world over, the younger generation in Goa woke up to his artistic genius only over the past four to five years. “He was already a superstar in Europe. He influenced an entire generation across three continents. But it was embarrassing that the younger generation in Goa knew nothing about him, until he was brought to the mainstream here through a festival we organised in his honour in 2017,” said Marius Fernandes, who became aware during his stint abroad of the fame Navelcar had gained in the art world internationally. “He was very shy and gentle, and when we organised the festival in his honour, people challenged us that he would not turn up. But my son and daughter spoke to him and he agreed. He was a teacher to the core who loved youngsters,” said Fernandes When youngsters Ashley Fernandes and Ronak Kamat filmed Navelcar for a documentary and asked him what it should be called, Navelcar decided to title the film, ‘I am nothing’. “He was an artist loved by many but understood by few. He was recognised globally for his work, but also denied timely formal recognition by the state, which mattered most to him. He will live on through his work for many years to come,” said Ashley.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/master-of-line-work-vamona-navelcar-passes-away-at-91/articleshow/87121870.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

According to the police, the boy went missing while playing outside his house in Naigaon, Dadar. Initially, police suspected the child may have been taken by his mother’s former husband. However, further investigations showed her boyfriend was also missing. On the hunch that the boyfriend might be the culprit, the police formed two teams to search places he was likely to have taken the boy. One team went to Hadapsar, while another continued the search in Mumbai. Senior inspector Jitendra Pawar said their Mumbai team tracked the accused down and rescued the child from Pardhiwada in Sewri. The police arrested the boyfriend, Vijay Ahire.

---||Delhi||T20 cricket on big screen: A three-hour, action-packed blockbuster?||NEW DELHI: An ICC T20 Men's World Cup cricket contest between India and Pakistan is as big a blockbuster as it gets for Gautam Dutta, CEO of PVR Ltd. He is preparing for it on the same footing as a mega movie release — turning over 75 PVR screens in 35 Indian cities into a stadium complemented by an army of face paint artists, dhol players, cheer girls and staff in sports gear. Finally emerging from the closure and capacity restrictions caused by Covid-19, cinema halls are finally beginning to operate across the country to decent occupancy. Recent releases such as the latest James Bond, No Time to Die, have performed well at the box office and registered better than expected collections. But most establishments are drooling at the double attraction of big screen and T20 cricket. Dutta said cinemas arousing themselves to life in most states need more excitement and content. And what better content can there be on the big screen than a live three-hour T20 match? And, Dutta pointed out, the duration of the match and the late evening timing made it the equivalent of watching an action-packed film. Anand Vishal, chief sales and revenue officer, Inox Leisure Ltd, revealed similarly that his company had planned cricket screenings at 50 locations in 25 cities, including the Nehru Place, Janak Place and Patel Nagar outlets in Delhi.  He explained that cricket was a part of cinema’s strategy to attract more visitors through alternative ‘non cinematic’ content. From concerts and stand-up comedy to sports events, cinemas are looking at novel experiences for viewers. Vishal is receiving queries from families and corporate houses for bulk bookings and already has a sponsor on board to cash in. Vishal hoped for a capacity turnout in all the matches featuring India and felt the knockout stages would be keenly watched if India qualified. A mall manager concurred with Dutta and Vishal. While footfall had started improving over the weekends, many brands were still wary of taking up spaces.  The T20 World Cup matches, especially the game screenings at cinemas, will get the atria buzzing with demand, he said. At both PVR and Inox, match-day tickets will go on sale like for any other big release by Wednesday. Sunday, they hope, will be sold out. People have booked entire auditoriums for their friends and families in recent months and Dutta expects the trend to continue. “We have been witnessing almost 1,500 private screenings per week in PVR theatres because people now like to book the entire hall for themselves and their family or friends,” Dutta said. “We are seeing an increased demand in this category for the match screenings too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/t20-cricket-on-big-screen-a-three-hour-action-packed-blockbuster/articleshow/87121811.cms||Amin Ali

The Ludhiana police have started this one-of-its-kind project under which we have got access to about 150 private CCTVs installed in different areas.”The JCP added, “The police stations and the post get live feed of these cameras and can also get it recorded. Thus, these cameras will help us not only keep surveillance in the areas, but also trace criminals. The police will get access to more private CCTVs with the consent of the residents.”The official said the fact that the police are keeping an eye on the people and the city also gives a sense of security to the residents.“Besides, the police have 650 CCTVs functional under the Safe City project. A team that sits at the police lines control room monitors them. With these cameras, we also keep a check on traffic chaos and alert the cops,” added Pareek. The private CCTVs also include those installed by different market associations and factory owners. Model Town SHO inspector Inderjit Singh said, “As of now we have access to private CCTVs installed at five locations in our jurisdiction. We have talked to the market associations to give access to other CCTVs installed at 15 more locations where we need surveillance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-police-gets-access-to-pvt-cctvs-also-to-increase-vigil/articleshow/87117114.cms||Payal Dhawan

The BJP has deputed four MPs — Arjun Ram Meghwal (Bikaner), CP Joshi (Chittorgarh), Diya Kumari (Rajsamand) and Kanakmal Katara (Dungarpur) along with leader and deputy leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and Rajendra Singh Rathore to reach out to voters. Meanwhile, from Congress, PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra and transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas were on the field for the campaign. Joshi inaugurated the party office at Kurabad in Vallabhnagar and talked about the impact of the Union government’s social welfare policies in the state. “At a time the Congress government has failed miserably, the only respite is PM Narendra Modi rescuing the state from every problem it is facing,” said Joshi. Kataria has been making personal appeals for BJP candidate Khet Singh in Dhariawad reminding the people of what the previous governments have done for tribal areas. Minister of tribal affairs Arjun Munda will hold three public meetings in Dhariawad next week. Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra reached Udaipur airport on Monday for his two-day programme to campaign for Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar constituencies. During an interaction with the media, Dotasra said, “The central government has not been able to provide relief to people of the country on any front. Instead, they are selling assets that were built by the Congress in the last 70 years.” Taking on BJP state president Satish Poonia, Dotasra said he speaks only what the RSS tells him to speak. “Our government has waived loans of farmers worth Rs 18,000 crore. Poonia is unable to see the plight of the farmers who are on the roads for the past 10 months. The central government had promised to provide 2 crore employment annually but has failed miserably.

Those with a turnover of more than Rs 5 crore will have to file only two returns in a year. The change has come into effect from October 1 and businessmen are happy with the development.NK Thamman, a tax expert, said, “From October 1, the frequency of filing job work return ITC-04 has been changed. Taxpayers, whose annual aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is above Rs 5 crore, will file ITC-04 once in six months—for April 1 to September 30 by October 25 and for October 1 to March 31 by April 25. Job work taxpayers with annual aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year up to Rs 5 crore will file ITC-04 once annually by April 25.” Welcoming the decision, Babbal Sharma, an electroplating unit owner, said, “The reduction in filing of GST returns is a big relief for us as most of the job work industry in Ludhiana has low turnover. There is hardly any unit with a turnover of more than Rs 5 crore.”Arvind Verma, another businessman, said, “We are thankful to the government for reducing the compliance burden of GST on us, but we also demand an easy-to-use mobile app for filing our returns without any hassle.” As per Section 2(68) of CGST Act, job work means treatment or process of goods belonging to another person. There are several processes in the industry which are outsourced by one factory to another by sending its goods to others.

The deceased Vipul Patel had left behind a suicide note on July 23 in which he had blamed his wife Punam Dadwani and his mother-in-law Babita for his extreme step. Patel had stated that the mother-daughter duo had planned the marriage with him in 2015 with an intention to get money from him. After the FSL in Gandhinagar confirmed that the suicide note was written by Patel, an offence of abetment to suicide at Chhani police station. According to Patel’s suicide note, Punam had filed false cases against him at a court in Anand to get maintenance money from him. He also wrote that although he was suffering from oral cancer, the two women did not show any mercy and refused to settle the issues amicably despite he was jailed. He blamed the two women for his death and hanged himself from the railing of the staircase inside his house. Police said that Punam had left Patel within five months of their marriage in 2015. Later she filed cases against him in Anand for maintenance. As Patel did not have any source of earnings, he could not pay the accumulated maintenance amount of over Rs 8 lakh due to which the court had sentenced him to imprisonment for 33 months in March.  Later, he was released on interim bail due to the pandemic. His family members told police that when he was out on bail, he was too depressed and worried about paying the maintenance amount as the two women had refused a settlement and was also facing difficulties in the jail due to his illness. In July, a day before his bail period was to end, Patel took the extreme step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-her-mother-booked-for-driving-husband-to-suicide/articleshow/87119541.cms||---

---||World||FDA to allow ‘mix and match’ approach for Covid booster shots||WASHINGTON: The Food and Drug Administration is planning to allow Americans to receive a different Covid-19 vaccine as a booster than the one they initially received, a move that could reduce the appeal of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and provide flexibility to doctors and other vaccinators. The government would not recommend one shot over another, and it might note that using the same vaccine as a booster when possible is preferable, people familiar with the agency’s planning said. But vaccine providers could use their discretion to offer a different brand, a freedom that state health officials have been requesting for weeks. The approach was foreshadowed Friday, when researchers presented the findings of a federally funded “mix and match” study to an expert committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration. The study found that recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose shot who received a Moderna booster saw their antibody levels rise 76-fold in 15 days, compared with only a fourfold increase after an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson. Federal regulators this week are aiming to greatly expand the number of Americans eligible for booster shots. The FDA is expected to authorize boosters of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by Wednesday evening; it could allow the mix-and-match approach by then. The agency last month authorized booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for at least six months after the second dose. An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will take up the booster issue Thursday; the agency will then issue its own recommendations. By the end of the week, tens of millions more Americans could be eligible for extra shots. The study presented to the FDA’s advisory panel last week, conducted by the National Institutes of Health, suggested that Johnson & Johnson recipients might benefit most from a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine. A shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also raised the antibody levels of Johnson & Johnson recipients more than Johnson & Johnson did, the study found, although not as much as Moderna did. Both Moderna and Pfizer require two initial doses, separated by about a month. A Moderna booster also raised antibody levels in Pfizer recipients higher than a third injection of Pfizer’s vaccine did, while a Pfizer booster raised the levels in Moderna recipients about as high as a third Moderna shot. Experts emphasized last week that the new data was based on small groups of volunteers and short-term findings. Only antibody levels — one measure of the immune response — were calculated as part of the preliminary data, not the levels of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus, which scientists say are also an important measure of a vaccine’s success. The study’s researchers warned against using the findings to conclude that any one combination of vaccines was better. The study “was not powered or designed to compare between groups,” said Dr. Kirsten E. Lyke, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who presented the data. While the research on mixing and matching doses is somewhat thin, even some scientists who have strongly criticized the Biden administration’s booster policy said that providers should be given a measure of discretion as the campaign ramps up. “If you look at the data, it certainly looks like it might be better,” Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Moderna or Pfizer boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients. “I think we should move quickly on this, because it’s already happening.” At the meeting Friday of the FDA’s expert panel, of which Offit is a member, top CDC officials argued that providers needed latitude to offer different vaccines as boosters because patients might have had adverse reactions after their initial shots or presented other new concerns. Providers also might not have access to a vaccine a patient initially received, they said. The federal government will cover the cost of a different vaccine as a booster only if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the approach, officials said. “I’d like to reiterate how important it is from a programmatic perspective to have a little bit of flexibility,” Dr. Melinda Wharton, a top vaccine official at the CDC, told the FDA panel. Dr. Amanda Cohn, another high-ranking CDC official, said: “From a public health perspective, there’s a clear need in some situations for individuals to receive a different vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fda-to-allow-mix-and-match-approach-for-covid-booster-shots/articleshow/87124826.cms||---

After futile searches in Thane and Mumbai, the Faraskhana police in August 2018 filed a chargesheet against Gosavi in court under Section 299 of the CrPC. Deshmukh came across an advertisment by Gosavi’s firm for jobs in hotels in Malaysia. He was asked to deposit Rs3.09lakh, including air fare, and told to reach Mumbai airport to fly out to Malaysia. However, he saw no one there. Deshmukh then realised that he had been cheated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-arrest-aide-in-2018-cheating-case/articleshow/87119615.cms||---

Police and excise officials have also seized liquor worth Rs 53 lakh, about 3.5 kg of ganja, 30 gm gold and 14 kg silver so far. Observers said with the campaign temperature rising, both the ruling party as well as the Opposition were going all out to woo the voters by pumping in huge amount of money and liquor. Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel said, “I have held a review meeting with all departments, including income tax, excise and police at Karimnagar. They were asked not to allow any money or liquor or any other means of luring voters. They are conducting checks frequently. There are three observers posted. Inter-disciplinary teams are also in action. We have been booking Model Code of Conduct violations.” Goel further said, “Political parties are filing complaints against each other. We are forwarding the same to district authorities and returning officers to check the veracity. Reports are sent to ECI. We had a meeting with representatives of the political parties where several issues were discussed.” What has been seized so far is a pittance. What is being spent would be many times more.

Tiwari, who was head of the state-level task force for welfare of farmers, joined Sena in 2019. Tiwari alleged that NCB’s top officials in Mumbai were ‘agents’ of BJP. “NCB is now trying to hide its wrong-doings. NCB court has kept Aryan in jail since there is a court holiday. So, there must also be a review of the judicial system of NCB court. SC must review working of the NCB’s zonal unit in Mumbai in the last two years. NCB is being used to settle political scores and drive personal agenda,” Tiwari told TOI. Tiwari’s urged SC to take suo moto cognizance to protect fundamental rights of Aryan, who has been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act by NCB’s zonal office in Mumbai. Tiwari sought Chief Justice NV Ramana’s ‘top priority’ intervention into the manner in which the ‘biased NCB’s is hounding film personalities, models and other celebs for nearly two years with ‘mala fide motives’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-man-moves-sc-for-probe-into-ncb/articleshow/87122005.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Nagpur||NBWL ayes Rs Rs 400cr interstate barrage in Tipeshwar’s eco sensitive zone||Nagpur: The standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has cleared the Rs400 crore interstate Channaka-Korata (Rudha) barrage on Penganga river in Adilabad district of Telangana.The project was cleared in the 65th meeting of the NBWL, held virtually on September 24. Maharashtra PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye told TOI that the project requires environment clearance (EC) and falls within the notified eco-sensitive zone of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Pandharkawda division.Limaye said a state-level committee constituted by the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), in its meeting on January 31, 2018, had already recommended mitigation measures for the project. The proposal is for the use of 213.48 hectare non-forest land within the notified ESZ and involves about 5,000 hectare non-forest land for construction of the barrage and submergence area in both Maharashtra and Telangana.To prevent mortality of ungulates, gaurs, and other animals if they fall in the barrage, the agency has been asked to provide escape routes at specified intervals. At every 200 metres, a 5 metre gap having 1:30 slope should be constructed in steps, with each step of not more than 10cm high and not less than 75cm wide on both sides.“After discussions, the standing committee decided to recommend the proposal subject to implementation of mitigation measures suggested by the SBWL committee in 2018. The canal water will have to be given to the forest department free of cost for the use of departmental purpose, if needed,” said Limaye.Also, as decided in the 8th meeting of SBWL on February 20, 2014, the project proponent shall deposit 2% cost of the proposed project with the Pench Tiger Conservation Foundation for habitat improvement of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining forests.“However, as Tipeshwar has now been part of the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), there is no clarity whether the 2% project cost has to be deposited with the MTR Foundation,” said officials.According to Limaye, the project cost is Rs139 crore and 2% of it comes to Rs2.78 crore, which has not been deposited by the user agency as of now. Among the other conditions include minimal use of heavy noise-making machines around the sanctuary area and the labourers deployed for the construction of canal should not camp in sanctuary or nearby area and should not use any resources of the sanctuary area.However, there is also no clarity about the project cost. TOI, after a spot visit in May 2018, had reported superintending engineer Mohammed Amjad Hussain as saying, “The project cost is Rs400 crore, of which Rs235 crore have already spent.”NBWL members Dr R Sukumar, HS Singh, and UD Singh supported the proposal as the project does not involve any forest area, it is away from the sanctuary and part of it falls within an ESZ.FACTS OF THE MATTER* Rs400 crore project is around 3.5km from Tipeshwar boundary and falls in ESZ* Project will bring 5,444 hectare land in Telangana and 1,210 hectares in Maharashtra under irrigation* It will also facilitate drinking water to 14 villages, having a population of 20,000* Maharashtra approved project in Inter-State Board for Joint Irrigation Project meeting on August 23, 2016||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nbwl-ayes-rs-rs-400cr-interstate-barrage-in-tipeshwars-eco-sensitive-zone/articleshow/87117417.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Police are yet to make any arrests. The victim’s family alleged that the killers passed communal remarks while thrashing him. Police, however, said it was a fight over a monetary issue and all involved were friends. Sources, meanwhile, said the argument began over a girl. The exact issue wasn’t clear. Soon after the crime, CCTV footage of the murder went viral on social media showing a group of men stabbing the victim. It also showed local residents and passersby not intervening to save him. The deceased youth, Imran, was a resident of Sangam Vihar and worked as a salesman in a store in south Delhi. Police got a call late on Sunday reporting that a youth had been stabbed by a group of men. A team reached the spot and found the youth bleeding profusely. He was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre where the doctors declared him dead. “Initial medical reports showed that the youth had one stab wound that caused his death. His family members were informed and the body was sent for autopsy. A crime and forensics team lifted evidence, while CCTV footage from the area was checked and locals questioned,” said a senior police officer. The family members of the deceased alleged that one of the accused first stabbed him and then kicked him twice on his chest, which led to his death. “After he returned from work, his friends called him out. After some time, I received a call from a neighbour saying that 4-5 men were thrashing Imran and hurling communal slurs at him,” alleged Ayesha, the victim’s sister. However, DCP (South) Benita Mary Jaiker said the motive behind the murder wasn’t clear.

While the Sena has fought elections outside the state in Goa, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in the past, Thackeray has not campaigned outside Maharashtra.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that the Sena president will go to Dadra & Nagar Haveli and campaign for the Sena candidate.

Here, Sena will be pitted against BJP’s Mahesh Gavit, and Congress’s Maheshkumar Dhodi. Shiv Sena has set up a campaign team in the constituency and Raut said that the Delkars are fighting against the tyrannical rule of the BJP. Raut said that Delkar’s family had even fought against Portuguese rule and claimed that the Delkars had to join Shiv Sena for their safety and protection. Raut said that since the Delkars had a lot of goodwill due to the work they had done, Sena would be able to win its first big poll outside Maharashtra. The Election Commission recently announced the by-election for Dadra & Nagar Haveli parliamentary seat, a part of the Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.

The BIT management has denied the charges and termed the complaint as an attempt to malign the image of the college.The teacher charged in her complaint that Shrikant Goje, principal of polytechnic section, and Rajnikant Mishra, principal of College Campus, behaved in indecent and offensive manner with her in the college premises on October 6, while she was in her cabin.When the teacher tried to leave the room, Goje allegedly caught her by the hand and tried to pull her back. Mishra too allegedly caught her dress and pulled her back. The teacher claimed to have sustained injuries on her hand during the manhandling, and her dupatta fell from her dress.She tried to take up the matter with working president of college Sanjay Wasade, but he was busy in meetings. Hence, she went to Ballarpur police station and filed a written complaint.Later, Wasade along with Goje and Mishra, and others, reached the police station. The survivor charged that the police did not register her complaint and acted with courtesy towards Wasade and others.Later, she claimed to have been deceived by college staffers with the promise of talking about the matter, and taken back to the college. The HoD has alleged that she was pressurised to file a normal complaint with the college management the following day. In return, an apology was tendered to her on October 8 by both the principals. She was then forced to leave for her home town the same day. She also alleged that a college staffer was after her all the time, trying to destroy her laptop and mobile phone. She, however, approached SP Arvind Salve and filed a fresh complaint, accusing both principals of seeking sexual favours and pressuring her. They allegedly used to touch her indecently and make indecent comments about her body parts. She has also charged them with threatening to kill her. She also charged one staffer Shailendra Bomanwar with trying repeatedly to take her to the principal duo. The teacher also claims to have audio recording of Mishra seeking phone numbers of students from Bihar and Jharkhand to obtain country-made pistols through them.Following the directives of the SP, Ballarpur police registered an offence in this connection late on Sunday night. Sanjay Wasade denied all the charges and claimed the principal duo had reprimanded her in front of some staff for not holding online classes, which had hurt her. He said she should have filed a complaint with internal compliant committee to address the harassment. Instead she went to the police station, where cops explained to her the process and then she formally filed a complaint with college authorities, Wasade said.“There were five witness to the incident and her claims of molestation are baseless. We sought explanation from both principals on the issue and made them apologize for reprimanding her in front of other staff,” Wasade explained.He claimed the written complaint with college management has no mention of the principals touching her or abusing her in filthy language. “She appears to have been instigated by somebody into making false claims to malign the institute,” he added.On the audio conversation where Mishra sought phone numbers to obtain pistol, Mishra claimed it was a lengthy conversation and edited to suit the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lecturer-alleges-molestation-by-two-principals-on-college-campus/articleshow/87117470.cms||Mazhar Ali

This would be Srikanth’s sixth election in last three years. It was on the very first occasion during the 2018 assembly polls that he realised how it was not easy to be in the fray. “My mother was scared. There was pressure from everywhere. For her sake, I withdrew from the contest,” he recalls. Srikanth says he loathes the functioning of the major political parties which, he said, work for their own ends. “Education and health facilities are what I seek to provide to the people of my constituency,” he says. Srikanth has got the ‘chapati roller’ (rolling pin) as his symbol — for which he had to fight with the election officials. Bandaru Nagaraju, who entered the electoral fray as an independent candidate in Dubbak by-election last year, came fourth by bagging 3,570 votes. Nagaraju’s symbol was rolling pin, which looked similar to TRS’ car. “I am not looking for votes which people may cast out of confusion between the symbols,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-stopping-srikanth-sixth-election-in-last-three-years/articleshow/87119692.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The National Geophysical Research Institute’s Geomagnetic Observatory in Tarnaka has observed that declination (moving towards east from west) in Hyderabad has changed 1.15 degrees, while inclination (moving downwards to south) has changed 4.31 degrees. Geomagnetic experts said east and west in geomagnetic terms have changed by 1.15 degrees and north and south have changed by 4.31 degrees in Hyderabad. N Phani Chandrasekhar of Geomagnetic Observatory said the geographic directions — north, south, west and east — will not change till the planet exists. However, geomagnetic directions have been changing, he said. “As per data and interpolation estimates, geomagnetic directions will completely reverse in 7,00,000 years. Geomagnetic directions change due to alteration in earth’s outer core. The rotating molten fluid changes in earth’s outer core are responsible for this,” he said. He said they have been recording the changes at the NGRI Tarnaka campus for the last 56 years and in Choutuppal since 2012. Chandrasekhar said vastu directions are measured with a compass. “The geographic axis from north to south is stable. The geomagnetic axis is located with a deviation of 11.5 degrees. This deviation changes constantly. At the equator, the deviation is narrow. The changes are slow in Hyderabad, which is a low altitude site. Changes are visible more in the polar region, while they are minimal in sites located close to the equator,” he said. He said observatories all over the world have been studying the geomagnetic changes for the past 200 years. He also said the Geomagnetic Observatory with high resolution uninterrupted magnetic time series magnetometers and satellite measurements, scientists and experts have been studying the changes in the earth’s interior and also the nearby space environment. “Though the phenomenon is global, the changes vary from one place to the other depending on distances to poles and the equator,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/earths-geomagnetic-directions-on-the-move-in-hyd-may-be-impacting-vastu/articleshow/87123770.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

In May 2019, the company acquired Sri Lankan cement player Singha Cement that operates a packing terminal in Colombo as part of its focus on a port-based distribution strategy. Before that, in March 2018, it had commissioned one of the largest port-based cement terminals in India at Krishnapatnam with an automated ship loading facility as well as packing terminals at Cochin, Gopalpur and Karaikal ports. As part of its port-based distribution strategy, the Rs 2476 crore turnover Penna Cement has also acquired a self-discharging cement carrying vessel with a maximum cargo capacity of 25,500 tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-nod-for-penna-cements-rs-1550-cr-ipo/articleshow/87119757.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pay wife Rs 1L as mental harassment is invisible harm, says court||MUMBAI: Observing that mental harassment is mental injury which is never visible to the eye and has to be gathered from the facts and circumstances of each case, a sessions court upheld an order directing the 36-year-old estranged husband of a Ghatkopar woman to pay her Rs 1 lakh compensation for causing both mental and physical harassment. The court refuted the defence that no medical evidence existed to prove the woman’s claims. “It is not always that injuries on the body of a woman can be seen because immediately after an assault normally they do not go for medical or are not allowed to go for medical by their in-laws,” the court said. The court further said there was ample evidence to show that the woman was subjected to mental and physical harassment at the hands of her husband and in-laws. It said the magistrate court had arrived at the proper conclusion that the woman was entitled to compensation. The unemployed woman, who told the court she was living at the mercy of her parents, was also ordered to be paid a monthly maintenance of Rs 15,000. The man moved the sessions court after a magistrate court ruled against him last year. The woman filed a domestic violence case against her husband and father-in-law after she was repeatedly beaten and starved. She said her husband would hit her whenever she tried to get intimate with him. She suspected he was impotent. The woman told the court she got married in 2013 and finally moved out in 2015. The court refuted the defence that the woman did not complain about an August 2013 assault incident to the police. It said no girl will complain about such solitary incidents putting her relationship with her in-laws at stake. The accused claimed an October 2014 assault incident alleged by the woman where she was left with a bleeding nose after she tried to get intimate with him was not plausible as his mother had undergone cataract surgery at that time. The court said there was nothing on record to show his mother was in hospital then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-pay-wife-rs-1l-as-mental-harassment-is-invisible-harm/articleshow/87122098.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Hyderabad||NBWL nod to Tipeshwar ESZ barrage||The standing committee of National Board for Wildlife has cleared the Rs400 crore interstate Channaka-Korata barrage on Penganga river in Adilabad district of Telangana. The project was cleared in the 65th meeting of the NBWL, held virtually on September 24. Maharashtra PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye told TOI that the project requires environment clearance (EC) and falls within the notified eco-sensitive zone of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Pandharkawda division. Limaye said a state-level committee constituted by the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), in its meeting on January 31, 2018, had already recommended mitigation measures for the project. The proposal is for the use of 213.48 hectare non-forest land within the notified ESZ and involves about 5,000 hectare non-forest land for construction of the barrage and submergence area in both Maharashtra and Telangana. To prevent mortality of ungulates, gaurs, and other animals if they fall in the barrage, the agency has been asked to provide escape routes at specified intervals. At every 200 metres, a 5 metre gap having 1:30 slope should be constructed in steps, with each step of not more than 10cm high and not less than 75cm wide on both sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nbwl-nod-to-tipeshwar-esz-barrage/articleshow/87119746.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man shot at while returning from murder case hearing in Kishangarh area||NEW DELHI: A man was injured in firing by unidentified assailants in the Kishangarh area on Monday afternoon. Police said that the incident took place around 1 pm when the victim, Shafiq, and two others—Somraj and Krishan—were returning home in their SUV after attending a 2020 murder case hearing. Somraj, who is the complainant in the present case, was one of the suspects in the 2020 murder case in which one Ashok Maan was killed. Possibly, the attackers tried to kill Somraj but missed their target and Shafiq, who was driving the vehicle, got injured, said an officer. When the SUV reached Kishangarh, it was intercepted by the accused and a total of four rounds were fired at the spot in which Shafiq received injuries on his temple and his hand. Somraj was sitting next to the driver seat and Krishan on the rear seat. “He was rushed to a hospital for treatment,” the officer said. An investigator said involvement of three to four people in the attack was suspected. “All angles are being probed in the case,” the cop said. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma said a case had been registered and the accused would be nabbed soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-shot-at-while-returning-from-murder-case-hearing/articleshow/87122122.cms||---

Kelwe police filed an FIR against Gosavi for allegedly cheating two youth, Utkarsh Tare and Adarsh Kini, from Edwan village in Palghar by promising them jobs in Malaysia and taking Rs 1.65 lakh from them in December 2018. Though the victims, who claimed to have been given fake visas and flight tickets, had filed their complaint in September 2019, the case against Gosavi was registered on Sunday. Gosavi came into focus when a selfie of his with Aryan after the latter’s detention by NCB went viral. After that, NCP’s Nawab Malik highlighted cheating cases registered against Gosavi in Pune and Thane. In his complaint, Tare stated the money was paid to Gosavi online. Gosavi, he said, ran a placement agency from Navi Mumbai, which complainants had visited. Tare and Kini stated they were to fly to Malaysia from Kochi. When they reached the airport, they learnt about the fake visas. Gosavi, they stated, never took phone calls after December 2018. API Bhimsen Gaikwad said a team has been formed to arrest Gosavi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-cheating-fir-against-ncb-witness-in-palghar/articleshow/87122148.cms||---

The startup has been incubated by M S University’s innovation startup and entrepreneurship. With just a simple scan, a user can get all details of their ride, like the driver and vehicle owner’s details among others. The users can even share such details with their loved ones through SafeSavaari, a mobile application that will be launched on Tuesday. Women travelling alone will be able to share their location live with pre-registered trusted contact and even multicast SOS distress call to trusted contacts. The feature will be initially launched for autorickshaws in Vadodara after which it will be rolled out across the state. Before developing the mobile app, the students had done a survey on public transportation covering 400 women in Vadodara and Bharuch. “The study suggested that 70% females do not prefer travelling alone in public transports. Around 50% prefer calling their family or friends to update them about their ride or they pretend to be on a call, just to feel safe. And 40% females would rather avoid using public transport,” said Batul Millwala, a final year student of BBA at ITM Vocational University and founder of the start-up. “Women still feel uncomfortable when it comes to traveling alone. SafeSavaari has been developed as a solution to this,” she said. Apart from Millwala, the team includes Priyanka Udasi, a fashion communication graduate from MSU, as marketing head and Hujefa Vohra, a BCA graduate from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University, as tech lead. The startup has also garnered support under the state government’s student startup and innovation policy. “On International Women’s Day, we had exhibited the idea before former chief minister Vijay Rupani and now we have successfully developed the app,” Milliwala said. Currently, QR codes have been pasted on 20 rickshaws. “Our plan is to paste a QR code on all the rickshaws available in Vadodara and then expand to other cities,” she said, adding that SafeSavaari certified rickshaw drivers will get rewards and recognition for their support. “Although some taxi aggregators provide SOS facilities to users, they do not have tie ups with rickshaw drivers. Also, using our app, users can get details with just one QR scan,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mobile-app-to-make-public-transport-safer-for-women/articleshow/87119822.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Delhi||Extremely rare cases of Covid vax adverse effects at Ganga Ram||New Delhi: Vaccines against Covid-19 are safe. But, in extremely rare cases, doctors say adverse effects such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia can happen. It is characterised by the presence of two conditions concurrently: formation of blood clot (thrombosis) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Dr Jyoti Kotwal, chairperson, department of haematology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, claimed they have seen seven such cases so far. The first case, she added, was recorded in June when a young patient’s serum sample was sent to the facility from Army Hospital (Research & Referral), and confirmed with the ‘gold standard test’. Five samples came from Kerala hospitals, and one from a neighbouring private hospital of Delhi, the doctor said. Low platelets can be caused by many conditions. But, the SGRH doctor said, presence of blood clot in concurrence with low platelet is extremely rare and a known adverse effect of the adenovirus-based Covid vaccines. Similar cases have been reported from Denmark, Germany and Canada also, she added. SGRH is the only hospital in India that has tests available to confirm vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, officials said. Dr Kotwal said the diagnosis is suspected if symptoms such as persistent headache, vomiting, bruises or bleeding occur between day 3-30 days of the first dose of the vaccination and platelet count is low. Further, if D-Dimer level is raised and PF heparin antibody (HPF4 IgG) is present, one can make a presumptive diagnosis, she added. Other leading hospitals like AIIMS and Lok Nayak said they hadn’t come across such cases yet. Globally, SGRH doctors said, the incidence of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) reported from the world is 1 in 1,00,000 to 1 in 1,27,000 vaccine doses, which is extremely rare and therefore its benefits far outweigh the risks, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/extremely-rare-cases-of-covid-vax-adverse-effects-at-ganga-ram/articleshow/87122160.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad second most expensive residential realty market in India||HYDERABAD: The ‘City of Nizams and Pearls’ has emerged as the second most expensive residential realty market in the country after the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). This is thanks to a steady rise in property prices on the back of robust demand. The city has also recorded the highest growth in residential property sales for the July-September quarter, says PropTiger.com’s latest report. According to the report, average residential property prices in Hyderabad on September 30, 2021, stood in the Rs 5,800-Rs 6,000 per sq ft range (Rs 5,751 per sq ft on average) as compared to Rs 9,600-Rs 9,800 per sq ft range (Rs 9,670 per sq ft) in MMR. Average residential realty prices in Hyderabad have raced past other IT hubs like Bengaluru which had average prices in the Rs 5,400-Rs 5,600 per sq ft range, Chennai with Rs 5,300-5,500 per sq ft and Pune with Rs 5,000-Rs 5,200 per sq ft. All these are weighted average prices as per new supply and inventory, said the report `Real Insight (Residential) July-September (Q3) 2021’. As many as 7,812 units were sold in Hyderabad in the July-September 2021 quarter, a 222% jump quarter-on-quarter and 140% rise year-on-year. A chunk of the sales took place in localities like Bachupally, Tellapur, Gandipet, Dundigal and Miyapur, among other places. “Despite the price rally, demand for property in Hyderabad continues to be robust – this is reflected not only in the sales numbers but also in the city’s inventory profile. Despite an unsold stock of 50,103 units, Hyderabad has the lowest inventory overhand of 25 months among the top eight cities in the country,” the report said While Delhi NCR has the highest inventory overhand of 62 months, Mumbai is second with 58 months, followed by Ahmedabad (42 months), Pune (41 months), Bengaluru (35 mths), Chennai & Kolkata (32 mths). According to Rajan Sood, business head, PropTiger.com, with housing affordability at a record high on the back of 10-year low home loan interest rates and sops offered by some state governments by way of reduced stamp duties and circle rates, he expects housing markets in the top eight cities to show stability in the ongoing quarter. “Though the overall cost of construction has gone up due to the rise in crucial input material cost, buyers are still being offered discounts temporarily instead of otherwise resulting increase in price. States can support the recovery process further by either announcing newer incentives for homebuyers or by extending or launching stamp duty and circle rate waivers,” Sood added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-second-most-expensive-residential-realty-mkt-in-india/articleshow/87123787.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Mumbai||Sale deed not undervalued in Eknath Khadse case, says court||MUMBAI: The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, while recently granting bail to sub-registrar Ravindra Muley in the Pune land deal case registered by the Enforcement Directorate against NCP leader Eknath Khadse, observed that prima facie, the April 2016 sale deed did not appear to be undervalued for payment of stamp duty, as alleged. The court also said that there is prima facie lack of evidence to show Muley’s connivance with the co-accused, Khadse, and of his actual involvement in any process connected with the proceeds of crime, including concealment, acquisition or use. The ED has alleged that Khadse conspired with two others -- his wife Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhari -- to purchase land in Bhosari, Pune district, at a distress value of Rs 3.75 crore when its value was almost Rs 23 crore. Muley, the then sub-registrar, at Haveli, Pune district, was accused of conniving with them and misusing his position to register the sale by showing its market value at less than Rs 4 crore and not insisting on a no-objection certificate (NoC) from the MIDC whose name appeared in a column on the land document. Muley was taken into custody when he responded to the ED summons. His non-arrest during the probe was a factor to consider for bail, said the court. Muley’s lawyer Mohan Tekavde had argued, and the court accepted, that “prima facie,” no loss was caused to the state exchequer as he registered the sale deed only after being satisfied that the appropriate stamp duty of Rs 1.3 crore was paid against the ready reckoner land value of Rs 22.83 crore. Tekavde also said the land was not acquired by MIDC, and hence there was no reason to seek its NoC and PMLA can’t be invoked in the case. The court said it is not shown that Muley connived to register the sale deed, which otherwise ought not to have been registered. For ED, special public prosecutor Kavita Patil had opposed Muley’s bail plea, saying it was a serious offence where he had “knowingly ignored the rights of MIDC.” She said if released, he may tamper with evidence or abscond. “Prima facie, it is not appearing that the sale deed registered on 28.04.2016 was under-valued for the purpose of paying the stamp duty and still it was registered by ignoring the rights and interests of MIDC in the land,” said the order passed by special judge H S Satbhai. The order said it is not shown that to register the sale, an NoC from MIDC was a pre-condition. Besides, “In ownership column, the name of one Abbas Rasulbhai Ukani was appearing,” the order said, adding that the Registration Act does not require the officer to verify title of the transferor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sale-deed-not-undervalued-in-khadse-case-says-court/articleshow/87122189.cms||---
---||Delhi||L&T wins bid to construct first Central Secretariat buildings||NEW DELHI: Infrastructure and construction major Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is likely to bag the project to construct the first three office buildings along the Rajpath, which are part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Plan. The company has quoted the lowest bid at Rs 3,142 crore, which is nearly 3.5% less than the government’s bid price of Rs 3,455 crore. The two other qualified bidders - Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC) Ltd and Tata Projects Ltd - have quoted more than the government bid price. These three buildings, each with the capacity to accommodate about 6,000 government employees, will come up on the plot where IGNCA was earlier located. The central public works department (CPWD) has set a tight deadline of two-and-half years for completion of these buildings. The agency has also floated the tender for construction of a low-rise Vice-President Enclave close to North Block. While there was speculation thatTata Projects may quote the lowest considering it’s already constructing the New Parliament Building where it has deployed a huge number of men and machineries, the company’s bid price was Rs 3,546 crore, which is nearly 9% more than the government’s estimated project cost. The second lowest bidder NCC quoted Rs 3,318 crore, which is 1.9% more than the estimated cost. The successful bidder will be responsible for demolition of the structures at the current site, construction of the buildings and their maintenance for five years as well. As a part of the massive Central Vista Redevelopment plan, the government has proposed construction of a Common Central Secretariat of 10 buildings to accommodate all ministries and a conference facility along Rajpath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lt-wins-bid-to-construct-first-central-secretariat-bldgs/articleshow/87122192.cms||Dipak K Dash

The demand was raised during a meeting of Sena functionaries with the officials of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) held on Monday. Other issues plaguing the city’s water supply were also discussed. “While there is still a considerable time for laying down the new water supply scheme for Aurangabad, there is a need to pay attention to the maintenance issues affecting the existing scheme. A dedicated workforce will help to address these issues, ensuring smooth water supply to citizens,” said local Sena functionary Raju Vaidya. Sena city chief Vishwanath Swami demanded the deployment of a security guard at the civic body-run overhead tank situated at N-6 CIDCO. “There are complaints of irregularities during filling up of water tankers at the overhead tank. An official watch is a must to bring an end to such practices,” he said. The municipal limits of Aurangabad have some areas, where no tap water is available so those places get water from water tankers arranged by AMC, that are refilled at the overhead tank among other places. During the meeting, Sena functionaries also raised the issue of erratic water supply in some parts of the city, including N-7 CIDCO and Budhha Vihar. Responding to the demands, civic authorities said all possible measures will be taken to improve the water supply of Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/appoint-ward-wise-workforce-to-maintain-water-supply/articleshow/87115425.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The driving schools were allegedly run under temporary sheds which were erected on vacant government land. The RTO East (KA 55) office which was functioning from a rented building on Dr Rajkumar Road at Shaktinagar was shifted to its own building at Rajivnagar on Outer Ring Road in April 2019. The building was inaugurated in June 2017 by then CM Siddaramaiah. After the RTO office started functioning from the new building, some driving schools which have their offices in Mandi Mohalla and other places in the city had allegedly started running their business at the vacant government land opposite office by erecting temporary sheds. Jana Sangrama Parishat (JSP) state vice president and activist Prasanna has registered a complaint with the transport department and to the district administration against the people running the driving schools. He told TOI, “They have not taken permission from RTO or revenue department to erect the sheds nor are they giving receipts to customers. They have illegally occupied government vacant land without any permission.” he said, adding illegal driving schools should be closed as it poses danger to the motorists. Prasanna, who had filed a complaint to the transport commissioner N Shivakumar along with photos of the illegal driving school sheds, has received a reply stating that the department will investigate the matter. When contacted, the regional transport officer (RTO), Mysuru (East Zone), Deepak, said, “I will verify the complaint and take up necessary action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/rto-to-probe-driving-schools-occupying-govt-land/articleshow/87117677.cms||---

The area in Malad (W) is part of cabinet minister Aslam Shaikh’s assembly constituency. On Monday, Lodha and Kankavli (Sindhdurg district) MLA Nitesh Rane met senior inspector of Malwani police station to complain about the Malwani pattern and police going soft on accused. “Immigrant Muslims are creating fear in the area and are coercing Dalit Hindus to flee. The Dalit Hindus have demanded action by police, but the action is not satisfactory,” said Lodha. Rane asked why despite a Bombay high court order, loudspeakers atop mosques had not been dismantled. Shaikh said the Centre had failed to provide aid during Covid, including vaccines, due to which vaccination centres had to remain closed many times. “BJP has nothing to showcase and with BMC elections around the corner, they are making up issues of Hindu-Muslim tension,” said Shaikh. DCP Vishal Thakur (zone 11) told TOI that some BJP leaders met Malwani police senior inspector on Sunday. “There is no tension. We did not lodge an FIR,” said Thakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-people-are-living-in-fear-in-malwani-claims-bjp/articleshow/87123797.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Meerut||Incessant rains create havoc in parts of west UP||Meerut/Bijnor: Incessant rainfall triggered by western disturbances in the last 24 hours threw normal life out of gear in the Delhi-NCR region and adjoining western Uttar Pradesh districts on Monday. Worst-hit were farmers whose harvested paddy crop lying in the fields for further processing was destroyed. Besides, people living in villages along the Ganga and its tributaries had to face nature’s fury once again. Schools in Meerut were closed on Monday and will remain shut on Tuesday as well since the Met department has predicted that the downpour will continue on Tuesday too. Alerts have been sounded in Bijnor and Amroha where the water level in the Ganga doubled - from 22,000 cusec to 45,000 cusec - due to heavy rainfall in the plains and hills of neighbouring Uttarakhand. A junior engineer at Ganga Barrage, Piyush Baliyan, said, "Water level in Ganga is rising. We have sounded an alert to the villagers along the river banks. There are around 25 villages here." "Bijnor has recorded 185.4mm in 24 hours. This is the highest in 19 years. In October 2002, there was similar heavy rainfall," added Satish Kumar, a senior scientist at Nagina agriculture and weather research centre. Bijnor district agriculture officer, Avdhesh Mishra, said that heavy rainfall has caused huge losses to paddy, mustard and pulse growers in Bijnor district. “Our survey reports are yet to arrive. As per the initial findings, the downpour has caused 30% loss to paddy crop,” he said. Meerut, too, witnessed heavy rainfall of 54mm which destroyed a lot of paddy crops already harvested and lying in the fields. Bablu Jatauli, a farmer in Meerut, said, "Once the harvested crop becomes wet, it turns black that fetches almost half the price we could have got under normal circumstances. I have 15 bigha of land. I had already harvested 40% of the crop. It will take time for me to assess the loss." Senior agricultural scientist at Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University in Meerut, Dr RS Sengar, said, "The untimely rains will have an adverse impact on the harvested paddy. But this rain will also push forward the sowing of other crops like potato and mustard which is sown soon after the paddy harvest. Farmers need time not only to harvest the crop, but also to prepare land for the new crop. This is not a good situation at all."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/incessant-rains-create-havoc-in-parts-of-west-up/articleshow/87117711.cms||Sandeep Rai

Calls made to the university’s Vice-Chancellor Dr PG Yeole and examination controller Yashwant Patil did not evoke any response, while registrar Rajshri Suryawanshi said, “I am not aware of the issue, but will take it up with the exam department.” Students pointed out that they are facing this odd situation despite Dr Yeole being elected as vice-president of the Pharmacy Council of India. Several students, who have bagged admissions to reputed institutes, including the National Institute of Pharmacy Education and Research (NIPER) in Guwahati (Assam), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Mohali (Punjab), on the basis of national entrance tests, have been asked by the respective institutions to submit their final-year marksheets. If they fail to do so, they will either not be allowed to appear for the first semester exams (that start next week), or their admission will be cancelled. Pharmacy professor Nana Darbhale said, “About 1,500 final-year students from about 16 colleges in the Marathwada region, which are affiliated to Bamu, are awaiting the results.” Avinash Chakkar, who bagged all-India 6th rank in the GPAT exams and is currently studying at NIPER Ahmedabad, told TOI, “I have made several calls and have even shot an email to Bamu, but in vain. Now, I fear I may have to miss the first-semester exam of my PG course.” Swati Pawar, who is currently pursuing PG at NIPER Guwahati, said that her institute has asked her to submit B.Pharm final-year result by November 1, or else, her admission will be cancelled. The situation is no different for other students — Vaibhav Lagad, Ramesh Khillare, Usha Rathod, Ansar Sayed, Pratiksha Ingale, Vijay Deshmukh — studying at different NIPERs. Aniket Garje, who had bagged admission for M.Pharm at Bharti Vidyapeeth, Pune, said, “The last paper was on September 3. However, till date, the results are not out. I have to submit my marksheet as a prerequisite for getting an education loan. I am worried.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamus-exam-result-delay-hits-pharma-students/articleshow/87115444.cms||Mohammed Akhef

As per conservative estimates, there has been around Rs 130 crore-Rs 140 crore revenue added to state coffers during these Puja days in the form of excise and state GST. Sources in the industry pointed out that sales per day of liquor and food in bars and restaurants taken together in the greater Kolkata area was Rs 50 crore-60 crore which for seven days could be anywhere between Rs 350-420 crore. “Liquor constitutes almost 45%-50% of this sale as an average which would be Rs 150 crore-Rs 175 crore and considering the tax rate on liquor from excise alone the state might have earned over Rs 105 crore-Rs 115 crore and the rest would come from food,” added sources. According to sources, some of the leading restaurant-cum-bars have registered sales figures above Rs 10 lakh per day and it even went up to Rs 15 lakh for a few on some days. There are 4,000-5,000 bars and restaurants in the city and outskirts with a combined revenue of Rs 6,000 crore-7,000 crore annually. The bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata alone had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000 crore-4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic. President of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India, Sudesh Poddar, who is owner of Songhay and Manthan in central Kolkata along with a lounge bar MS Bar & lounge, said for him liquor and food was 50:50 during Pujas. “Puja days were really great for us,” he added. Anjan Chatterjee, founder and chairman of Speciality Restaurants that has brands like Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta, Haka, Asia Kitchen, Café Mezzuna, said its sales were the best in the last 2-3 years. Owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari said it was the best week by far in 2-3 years. Debaditya Chaudhury, MD of Chowman, Oudh 1590 & Chapter 2, pointed out that both dine-in and delivery were excellent. Charles Mantosh, owner of Moulin Rouge, Floriana, Magnolia on Park Street, said it had to close kitchen on one of the Puja days asthey were running out of stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bumper-puja-sales-in-bars-restos-may-have-added-over-rs-100-cr-revenue-to-state-coffers/articleshow/87119960.cms||---

With the drop in the number of active cases, the Covid recovery rate of the region has improved to 97.4%, which is in line with the average recovery rate of Maharashtra. However, at 2.51%, the mortality rate among Covid patients in Marathwada is slightly higher than the state average of 2.12%, as per official data. Dr Swapnil Lale, the deputy director of health for Aurangabad division, on Monday, said people in general should not lower their guard against Covid even though the number of active cases has reduced. “The upcoming Diwali festival and the approaching winter season are two most crucial factors that could cause a spurt in fresh cases. While Diwali invariably witnesses crowding, the travel of urban population to their native places in rural areas is also a reason to worry as the population from rural areas is relatively lesser exposed to the virus and thus has lower herd immunity,” he said. He said a pandemic like Covid follows a bell-shaped curve and therefore chances of a fresh outbreak cannot be ruled out. “While following Covid-appropriate behaviour is a must for everyone, every eligible citizen should get fully vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. As per the official data, Osmanabad district currently has the highest number of active cases in Marathwada (257) whereas Hingoli has the lowest (5). Among the remaining districts, Beed has 169 such cases, followed by Aurangabad (140), Jalna (67), Latur (39), Parbhani (27) and Nanded (23). Since the outbreak of Covid last year, Marathwada has reported 6,28,248 cases, including 6,11,751 recoveries and 15,770 deaths, as per the data from the office of Aurangabad divisional commissioner||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/active-cases-of-covid-drop-by-half-in-marathwada-in-a-months-time/articleshow/87115482.cms||Prasad Joshi

Three juveniles have been apprehended while one is absconding. Ramkishan, who lives in the same locality, had just reached the stall around 4am, when three teenagers, “who were all inebriated, came there and asked him to serve them some refreshments. Ramkishan told them that it was too early to start his kitchen. This irked the teens and they started arguing”, said an officer. The trio then left the shop to smoke cigarettes nearby. After some time when Ramkishan went there to pee, the teens made comments that led to a fight. As local people gathered, the accused left the spot. “But they returned to the shop after some time with another friend armed with a countrymade pistol. They shot Ramkishan in the leg and fled,” the officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Gaurav Sharma said the victim was admitted to a hospital, but out of danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tea-stall-owner-shot-at-by-4-juveniles-after-argument/articleshow/87119981.cms||---

It added that "before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective". The statements came a day after WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan had said the UN agency’s technical advisory group (TAG) would meet on October 26 to consider EUL for Covaxin. WHO said while Covaxin’s manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, has been submitting data on a rolling basis and its experts have reviewed this data, it is "expecting one additional piece of information from the company today". However, neither WHO nor Bharat Biotech specified what information has been sought. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts held a meeting on Covaxin’s EUL application on October 5.WHO had stated, on October 5, after its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts held a meeting on Covaxin’s EUL application, that the WHO and an independent group of experts were "scheduled to meet next week to carry out the risk/benefit assessment and come to a final decision whether to grant EUL to Covaxin" after the company had submitted additional information on September 27. On Monday, WHO said: "The timeframe for the WHO EUL procedure is dependent on how quickly a company producing the vaccine is able to provide the data required for WHO to evaluate the vaccine’s quality, safety, efficacy and its suitability for low- and middle-income countries." "When the information provided addresses all questions raised, WHO and the technical advisory group will complete the assessment and come to a final recommendation whether to grant EUL to the vaccine," WHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cant-cut-corners-for-emergency-nod-to-covaxin-who/articleshow/87123799.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

In another development later in the day, the SIT arrested four aides of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish. The accused, including Sumit Jaiswal, who got the cross FIR lodged against the farmers, had been absconding after their convoy allegedly mowed down four farmers and a journalist. In a video that went viral, purportedly from the Kheri violence, Jaiswal, in a blue kurta, was seen coming out of the Thar (an SUV) that ran farmers over. He gave multiple interviews to news channels thereafter. The day the SIT was formed, he suddenly went missing. The other three accused were identified as Shishupal, who was allegedly driving the third SUV (a white Scorpio), Nandan Singh Bisht and Satya Prakash Tripathi. A licensed pistol and three bullets were recovered from Tripathi, a resident of Kaushambi district, who was in the second SUV (a black Fortuner) and had fled the spot. Jaiswal is a BJP worker and a ward member from Lakhimpur city while Nandan Singh Bisht is an accountant for Ankit Das, one of the key accused in the case who was arrested earlier along with Mishra following protests by farmer groups. A total of 10 arrests have been made by the SIT in the case. SIT officials said the four were arrested from their respective residences. A senior official claimed the four were present at the spot on the day of the incident. Special prosecution officer S P Yadav told TOI the four accused will be produced in front of a remand magistrate on Tuesday since the regular court will be closed on account of a holiday. “SIT is questioning the accused and may seek remand custody if needed,” he said. Meanwhile, 15 farmers appeared before the SIT on Monday to record their statements in the alleged lynching case after notices were issued to them under sections of the Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). An SIT member said, “We have been investigating both the FIRs and the farmers were summoned in connection to the second FIR and they were sent back after questioning.” Every farmer was questioned for over 15 minutes in the presence of their advocate Mohammed Amaan, sources said. Jasbir Singh Virk, president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan told TOI that of the 15 farmers who appeared before the SIT, only 11 recorded their statement due to lack of time. "The SIT asked questions related to the incident and the same statement was recorded for both the FIRs. They were asked questions such as how did they realise they were in danger and what did they do after farmers were mowed down etc. We have told the SIT members that farmers will cooperate with them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sit-notice-to-over-50-farmers-in-bjp-workers-lynching-case-11-quizzed/articleshow/87117749.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Aurangabad||Dozen Sena MLAs about to quit party: Babanrao Lonikar||Aurangabad: Almost a week after claiming that 12 Shiv Sena MLAs have been in touch with his party, former Cabinet minister and BJP functionary Babanrao Lonikar on Monday said these public representatives were on the verge of quitting their party. “These MLAs are fed-up with the functioning of the MVA government and are on the verge of exiting the Shiv Sena. There is dissent among these MLAs as their constituencies are deliberately neglected for official funding,” he told the reporters at Nanded. Lonikar also referred to Pratap Sarnaik — a Sena MLA from the Ovala-Majiwada constituency in Thane district — who had recently addressed a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking an alliance with BJP in the wake of the “harassment” by the central agencies. Mentioning former MLA Subhash Sabne, who has left Sena and is contesting for the Deglur bypoll on a BJP ticket, Lonikar said some audio clips were available showing dissent among the Sena leaders. Lonikar went on to say that the disgruntled MLAs from all three MVA partners — Sena, NCP and Congress — were in touch with BJP. “The MVA leaders repeatedly say that their government is intact and will remain in the power. Such statements come as they know there is growing unrest among their MLAs,” he said. In the past, Shiv Sena had refuted BJP leaders’ claims that its MLAs are leaving the party. Sena said the BJP functionaries were “daydreaming”. Lonikar, who is in charge of the Deglur byelection, said the BJP would post a bigger win in the October 30 poll than the recent bypoll victory at Pandharpur. “Nanded district has been starved of development despite being dubbed as a Congress bastion for years and with the Chavan family being in control. The rain-hit farmers have been left in the lurch by the government that has made only hollow announcements. The unrest would reflect in the poll debacle of the MVA in Deglur,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dozen-sena-mlas-about-to-quit-party-babanrao-lonikar/articleshow/87115525.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Kochi||Study centre for tribal students||Thiruvananthapuram: Peringammala grama panchayat has built a cultural home and community study centre for tribespeople at Pottomavu in Vengola ward. The centre aims to raise educational standards of students and preserve native art forms of tribespeople. In the village, there are approximately 40 students from 80 families. The panchayat authorities said that due to frequent attack of wild animals, weak network connectivity and lack of facilities in their houses, students are unable to access online classes. The centre is located at a place where students from all locations can come easily, panchayat representatives said. The first floor of the building will be utilized for conducting tuition classes for students and the second floor will be used to promote extracurricular activities. The tribal department has selected a tutor from the village. The facility includes digital classrooms, benches and desks. The cultural home promotes extracurricular activities, especially their traditional art forms like ‘kalattakali’. “The children from this area are poor in their studies. Majority of students usually drop out of school and take up traditional jobs such as collecting honey, cloves, and cinnamon from forests. The centre can also be used to conduct small functions, classes and health checkups,” said Vengola ward member M G Jayasingh. “People of this village are financially backward and their houses are really small. The students were not able to study in those circumstances. This initiative will surely provide a better study environment and they can keep their study materials in the study centre,” said Peringammala panchayat vice-president Vasantha B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-centre-for-tribal-students/articleshow/87117803.cms||---

Hafiz Ajmatullah, who had completed his 'hafiz' from a local seminary, was often seen hanging from pipes and bars in his house. He was about five feet in height. On Sunday, like any other day, he began his exercise by hanging from a pipe with the hope of becoming taller. But, he got stuck in a sort of noose he had made for support. His hands slipped off a pipe he was hanging from and the noose choked him to death. The tragic incident happened in Gangwar village. His parents are in deep shock now. Ajmatullah was the elder son and belonged to a well-off family. His father owns a weighbridge or 'truck scales' mainly used for weighing large industrial vehicles and their contents for commercial purposes. Sitting in a corner still trying to come to terms with the tragedy, Niyamtullah, the teenager's father, said, "My elder son was short in height. So, he used to exercise. No one made fun of him for his height. It was his passion. He wanted to look tall." "We never ever expected this to happen. His hands slipped from a pipe and the noose of a rope somehow got stuck in his neck. And he died," Niyamtullah added. "My wife climbed the stairs to the second floor of our house for some work. She was shocked to find our son's lifeless body hanging from a pipe. We rushed him to a local hospital where the doctors pronounced him as dead," the heart-broken father said. Ajmatullah's funeral took place without informing the police, locals said. When contacted, SHO of Rehar police station, RP Sharma, said, "We conducted an initial probe. No formal complaint has reached us so far. It seems to be a tragic accident."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-teenagers-obsession-to-gain-height-cost-his-life/articleshow/87117802.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Delhi’s wettest October day in 65 years||NEW DELHI: The monsoons may have retreated from the city, but the highs it created in the records during the season don’t seem to have ended. On Monday, Delhi recorded the wettest October day in the past 65 years. The rain-lashed day saw the Safdarjung weather station, the capital’s base station, receiving 87.9mm of rainfall till 8.30 am on Monday. Before this, the logbooks show the highest 24-hour rainfall on a single October day in 1956 with 111mm. By 5.3pm on Monday, the total precipitation for October measured 95mm, the highest for the month since 1960, when 93.4mm was recorded. An IMD official said Delhi is likely to experience more showers in the remaining days of the month. The all-time high for the month was 238.3mm in 1956. The normal rainfall for October is, otherwise, a mere 28mm. IMD data shows the city received 3.3mm rainfall on Sunday. While three more rain days were recorded in the first week of October, the monsoon then withdrew from Delhi, officially on October 8. Monday’s rain had a salubrious effect, not only reducing the pollution level but also bringing down the maximum temperature to 23.9 degrees Celsius, nine below normal. It was the lowest maximum temperature to be recorded in a decade. Apart from Safdarjung, two other weather stations recorded heavy rainfall in the 24 hours between 8.30am on Sunday and 8.30am on Monday — Lodhi Road (85.5mm) and Ayanagar (70.1mm). Palam and Ridge received moderate rainfall of 56.1mm and 54mm, respectively, in the same period. IMD classified precipitation between 64.5mm and 115.5mm in a day as ‘heavy’. Charan Singh, head, regional meteorological centre, told TOI, “The interaction of easterly and westerly winds over northwest India and moisture from Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea reached northwest India and caused heavy rainfall in Delhi, Uttarakhand, west UP, Haryana and north-east Rajasthan.” Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, added, “Delhi received unseasonal rain on Monday. After the withdrawal of the monsoon, westerly winds prevail over the region. The western disturbance impacts in the fag-end of October and intensifies from November to January.” Though the maximum temperature saw a dip, the minimum temperature stayed above normal due to cloud cover. The night temperature was recorded at 20.1 degrees Celsius, two above the normal for the period. According to the forecast given by IMD, the weather is likely to remain dry from Tuesday. The met department said mist or shallow fog may be recorded during morning hours on Tuesday and the maximum temperature is likely to rise to 29 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature may hover around 18 degrees Celsius from October 21 to 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-wettest-october-day-in-65-years/articleshow/87120051.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Kochi||More arrests cannot be ruled out in fund fraud case: Cops||Thiruvananthapuram: The police team probing into the fund fraud in the Nemom zonal office has not ruled out chances of more arrests in the case. Police have sought the custody of Sunitha, the cashier who was earlier arrested in connection with the case. Fort AC S S Shaji, who heads the probe team, said that police were open to investigating chances of more staff being involved in the fraud. Nemom police had earlier centred the investigation mainly around Sunitha and even when the bail plea of Santhi, who was the charge officer, was rejected, police were not keen on arresting her. Nemom police had till now downplayed the alleged role of Santhi in the case as ‘supervisory lapse’. “The next step in the investigation is to find out whether more people were involved. We will be able to probe in this direction once we take Sunitha into custody for further questioning. If she sheds light on the role of other staff in Nemom zonal office in this fraud, we cannot rule out more arrests in the case,” said Shaji. When asked if there is a need to arrest Santhi at present as part of the probe, police said that they were actively probing all persons reportedly involved in the case. Even in the complaint filed by the corporation secretary with the Nemom police, probe was demanded for joint and several liability of Sunitha and Santhi. Officials also said that while police call Santhi’s role as supervisory lapses, there were clear directions issued on record regarding delegation of duties to the charge officer, which will make her equally accountable in the fund fraud. According to corporation sources, even if it has to be considered as a supervisory lapse, the fraud happened over a period of one year with regard to 25 days’ collection at zonal office and it was improbable that a supervisory lapse could repeat over such a prolonged period of time. The corporation secretary in the complaint demanded probe into charges of fund embezzlement, conspiracy and cheating. The internal probe has also revealed that Sunitha never transported money from the corporation office to the bank during the period when the fund went missing from the corporation’s account. Meanwhile, BJP is learnt to have decided to step up the momentum of protests. As many as 35 BJP councillors may go on a fasting strike at the main office. “The ruling council is protecting the key accused in the case. Unless the main people responsible for the fund fraud is arrested, BJP will continue the protests,” said BJP parliamentary party leader M R Gopan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/more-arrests-cannot-be-ruled-out-in-fund-fraud-case-cops/articleshow/87117770.cms||---

Bhavesh Soni, who owns a jewellery shop in Chhani, suffered a bullet injury on his leg after one of the accused opened fire at him from a country-made pistol. In his complaint to Fatehgunj police station, Soni said he left his shop at about 9.30pm in his car and stopped at a restaurant on the way. After packing some food, Soni reached his residential colony in Nizampura area about 10 pm. “When I came out of the car and was about to pick up my bag that had Rs 1.50 lakh cash and some jewellery, two men approached me on a motorbike. One of them tried to snatch the bag from the car but I closed the vehicle’s door and locked the car,” Soni told TOI. When the robbers got into a scuffle with him, Soni hit one of them with the food parcel he was carrying. “One of them suddenly took out a pistol and fired at me. I got hit on my leg after which which I raised alarm. Two other men came on a motorbike and all the four then fled from the spot,” 43-year-old Soni said. There was not much movement of people in the residental colony which mostly has bungalows. The police said that they went through the CCTV footage of the area after the incident to get clues about the accused. Police said that they have got images of two of the accused but their faces aren’t clearly visible.  It appeared that the gang of four had been following Soni after he left his shop and they were waiting for the right opportunity to loot him. The cops are trying to trace the accused on the basis of the motorbike’s license plate number. Soni said that all the accused were aged between 25 to 30 years and though they were masked, he had never seen them in his shop in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jeweller-wards-off-robbery-bid-suffers-bullet-injury/articleshow/87120027.cms||---

Bhupendra Pratap Singh, 55, a retired school teacher who had been practising as a lawyer since 2019, was allegedly shot dead by his rival, an advocate. The assailant, Suresh Gupta, fled after the attack, leaving behind a country-made pistol. Police scanned CCTV footage and zeroed in on Gupta later in the day. A blood-stained shirt of the accused was among the other evidence seized, said police sources. Singh had a "rivalry with the advocate", police said and added that they have taken the latter into custody for questioning. Gupta is believed to have confessed to the crime. Sanjay Kumar (SP, city) and the district amgistrate Indra Vikram Singh rushed to the court to take stock of the situation. Inspector general (IG), Bareilly range, Ramit Sharma also reached Shahjahanpur after directions from ADG, Bareilly zone, Avinash Chandra, and questioned the accused. Sharma said, “Police acted swiftly and carried out a thorough investigation and found out that the victim and his rival, Suresh Gupta, had registered over two dozen cases against each other in court. We questioned Gupta and he confessed to have committed the murder. We have recovered his shirt which has blood stains. All the evidence collected will be verified in a forensic lab. Gupta will be sent to jail after questioning is over.” Three police personnel have been suspended by the SSP, S Anand, and action against more cops is likely. There are metal detectors at all the entrances, barring gate number 1, which is reserved for the magistrate and other court staff. A few advocates also use the same gate to park their vehicles. CCTV cameras are installed at all the entry points of the court. Police registered an FIR on a complaint by the victim's kin against Gupta and his two sons under section 302 (murder) and 120b (criminal conspiracy). Police, however, didn’t find any evidence to link Suresh’s sons to the murder. There was anger among advocates across the state after the incident and protests were staged by them in most of the districts. The protesting lawyers claimed that the incident happened due to negligence on the part of the police. Advocate Singh was a resident of Jalalabad and used to live with his younger brother Yogendra Pratap Singh and his family. “Two months ago, Bhupendra Singh and Suresh Gupta had fought inside the court and I had given them a warning," said Anant Singh, president of the district bar council. There have been several incidents in the past of shooting in courts of Uttar Pradesh. A man accused of double murder was shot dead inside a court in Bijnor in December 2019, and a bar council head was shot dead by her fellow advocate inside court in Agra in June 2019. In September this year, rivalry between two groups played out in Delhi's Rohini court where a gangster was shot dead in full public view, and the two attackers were gunned down by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/lawyer-shot-dead-in-up-court-by-rival/articleshow/87117843.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Among other rain-related incidents on Monday, there was a cave-in that left a tree tilting over a section of Jogender Singh Marg resulting in the District Centre-Lal Sai Marg carriageway being closed for vehicular movement. Having become the icon of the poor road drainage system this rainy season, Pul Prahladpur underpass was shut again for vehicle movement from 8am till 7pm. But water accumulation was reported from many other locations, including the ITO junction. Many prominent roads suffered heaving waterlogging and there were similar complaints about internal roads in many colonies. Roads in south Delhi, including the Barapullah flyover, were choked and traffic moved at snail’s pace. “Innumerable vehicles had problems negotiating the pooled water. Traffic policemen even had to help push stalled cars,” said a traffic officer. “Our men on ground made sure traffic movement was smooth. Through our Twitter account, we kept informing commuters about the road situations.” At the Ghazipur fruit and vegetable wholesale market in Delhi, the accumulated rainwater inconvenienced both sellers and visitors. The municipal corporations received deluge complaints from various places. While South Delhi Municipal Corporation had to look into a flooded road in Vikaspuri and a tree falling in Dwarka, Sector 8, the north corporation received complaints about the submerged Guru Nanak Road, Adarsh Nagar, Mundka metro station and 30-Foot Road in Rohini. In the various markets, however, things appeared better than on Sunday though there still were bothers for buyers and sellers. Rajendra Sharma, general secretary, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association said, “Ours is one of the biggest wholesale markets in the country and traders are paying so much tax, but look at the condition of the roads. It is difficult to believe that any arrangements had been made to control waterlogging due to rain. Due to the festival season, there is a huge rush in the market and people were discomfited by the muddy roads on Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-leads-to-waterlogging-yet-again-pul-prahladpur-among-usual-suspects/articleshow/87120116.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The fully vaccinated people were allowed to access the reading rooms. All this time, readers booked slots 24 hours in advance to walk into the sprawling Belvedere campus in Alipore.  The authorities fixed different head counts for various sections, including the reading rooms, to ensure the presence of a limited number of visitors at a time. On November 23, last year, the library had reopened after eight months. But readers had to pre-register on the official website of the library. People, aged over 60 years, were barred from visiting the library. The library campus was closed on weekends while reading rooms functioned from 10am to 5pm and the lending section only till 3pm.  From Monday, service hours of the reading rooms at Bhasha Bhavan and the annex building were extended to the original pre-pandemic timings — from 8am to 8pm on weekdays and from 9.30am to 6pm on weekends and other public holidays. Those, who have been inoculated with both the doses, were allowed to walk in by producing their final vaccination certificates. As per Covid-19 protocol, only alternate seating arrangements are available and readers can’t sit side-by-side. Senior citizens have been allowed in for some time. But those, aged below 18 years, still can’t enter the library. The online booking rule will be applicable for those without final vaccination certificates. Ajay Pratap Singh, director-general, National Library, told TOI, “As per central government’s guidelines, only fully vaccinated people can access the library. Since September 1, research scholars have been allowed without slot-booking. We made allowances for readers who have travelled long distances and have failed to book online.”  Veteran reader Saibal Chakraborty said, “I am glad that the authorities have heeded to the plea of the library readers’ body, Democratic Research Scholars Organization, and thought of many students who depend on this iconic institution for higher education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/national-library-back-to-pre-covid-schedule/articleshow/87120090.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 30-year-old biker who lost left leg in accident given Rs 72 lakh relief||MUMBAI: Pointing out that enjoyment of life, including married life, of a 30-year-old who lost his left leg after his bike was crushed by a speeding truck, has been greatly compromised, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal awarded him a compensation of Rs 72 lakh (with interest). The man from Andheri, Bharatchandra Bera, lost his 35-year-old friend who was riding pillion when the accident took place in 2012. In a separate order in 2019, his family was awarded a compensation of Rs 39 lakh by the tribunal. Among the compensation components, Bera was awarded Rs 1.50 lakh for pain and suffering and Rs 2 lakh for loss of life’s amenities. “Due to the accident, injuries and amputation, applicant must have suffered great pain, trauma etc. Looking at the age of applicant, he has to bear the injury-related pain, suffering and trauma etc. for life. Because of the amputation, he cannot do many activities in life like a normal person,” the tribunal said. In November 2013, Bera moved the tribunal against the truck owner Heera Devi and ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd. The accident took place around 2.30 am when Bera and his friend were on their way to Kalyan. He said the truck rammed into the bike from behind, leaving him with a mangled leg. His friend died on the spot. Bera had a restaurant business before the accident and claimed to be earning Rs 70,000. He said he had to shut his restaurant due to his disability. Bera sought a compensation of Rs 1.33 crore. However, relying on records of income tax returns, the tribunal found that Bera’s monthly earning was around Rs 25,000. While he claimed he had no earning for three years after the accident, the tribunal said it was difficult to accept. “..applicant has not informed as to how he managed his domestic and medical expenses when he could not resume his business for three years,” the tribunal said. The tribunal pegged loss of future income at Rs 27 lakh. It said it cannot be ignored that losing a limb is never easy. “Both mentally and physically, amputation negatively affects a person and inevitably changes the life as well as the lives of loved ones… Amputation is not just physical loss of a limb-it is also the readjustment of a person's very way of living and requires relearning how to do many things that were once second nature,” the tribunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-yr-old-biker-who-lost-left-leg-in-accident-given-rs-72-lakh-relief/articleshow/87122312.cms||Rebecca Samervel

So far, the cash seizures have been just Rs 1.57 crore, surprising enforcement authorities. Two days ago, district collector RV Karnan, Karimnagar police commissioner V Satyanarayana and other election officials in a meeting with bankers decided to keep an eye on unusual transfer of money into e-wallets. “From a single bank account/e-wallet, if there is a bulk transfer of money into wallets, we should be able to know. Since the police checking has intensified, transporting cash is not so easy. So, there is every possibility that some contesting candidates might try to influence the voters by transferring money into e-wallets,” a senior district police officer told TOI. “To negate the digital flow of money, we sought the help of bankers to keep surveillance on e-wallets,” the police officer added. Police are expecting the money flow into e-wallets to increase in the last three days leading to the October 30 bypoll day, especially when cash flow is tightened.“The police and other election officials will have no clue until bankers bring it to their notice. Similarly, the other unusual form of digital transactions are also being monitored,” another official. Officials said since Huzurabad bypoll is a prestigious election with the BJP locking horns with the ruling TRS, voters will be lured by leaders distributing money.Instructions have also been given by election authorities to install CCTVs near the cash counter of every wine shop to verify the transactions. “We will see that liquor is not given to customers on submission of tokens that could be sponsored by a candidate,” added one official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poor-bypoll-cash-haul-now-lens-on-e-wallets/articleshow/87123800.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Jaipur||94% Rajasthan students use tobacco products in schools: Survey||JAIPUR: Most students in the age group of 13-15 years smoke or use tobacco products in schools in the state, according to the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS-4) released on Monday. After school (93.8%), students prefer homes of friends (2.4%), own homes (1.1%), social events (1%), public places (0.9%) and others (0.7%) for smoking, the survey shows. But the survey found that the prevalence of tobacco consumption among children (13-15 years) in the state is much less than the national average. While it is 4.1% in the state, it is 8.5% nationally. Similarly, the current use of tobacco products among girl students in the same age group is 7.4% nationally, but it is just 0.4% in Rajasthan. The school-based survey, mooted by the ministry of health and family welfare, has been conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) under the guidance of a technical advisory committee with the support of World Health Organisation (WHO). The survey showed that 100% school principals were aware of the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Product Act (COTPA), 2003; 97.1% of schools followed ‘tobacco-free school’ guidelines; and 94.1% of them were aware of the policy of displaying ‘tobacco-free' boards. Besides, 64.7% of schools have been authorised by the state government to collect fine for violations under Section 6 of COTPA. Despite the ban on sale of tobacco products to children, 98% current bidi and 97% cigarette smokers bought them from stores, paan shops, street vendors or vending machines. The disturbing fact is that 99.5% of bidi and 98% cigarette smokers were not refused these products because of their age, as per the survey. IIPS professor Murli Dharan said the survey was conducted in 34 schools which have 2,735 students. Around 90% of the children said that they developed the habit of tobacco consumption from schools. The survey calls for policy recommendations, including starting anti-tobacco campaigns at primary school level as most students start using tobacco as early as seven to eight years. The encouraging part is that 89% of students tried to quit smoking in the past 12 months, with 34% of them using smokeless tobacco for the purpose. “Though the tobacco consumption among the 13-15 year old population in Rajasthan is much less in comparison to the national average, we are putting efforts to bring it to zero here,” said a health department official. He said to discourage tobacco consumption among youth, the state government had imposed a ban on e-cigarettes and hookah bars. If someone runs a hookah bar, he will be liable for 1 to 6 years of imprisonment and a fine ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. WHO representative Vineeta praised the health department and the state government for the good work done in de-addiction and tobacco control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/94-raj-students-use-tobacco-products-in-schools-survey/articleshow/87122321.cms||---

Andhra Pradesh currently has only a few hundreds of CBSE schools compared to about 60,000 state schools. The arduous task of fulfilling the CBSE norms and bye laws are those that discourage the state schools to seek CBSE affiliation. While the students of CBSE curriculum will have the flexibility of migrating to any part of the country, the state curriculum is tailor-made for the needs of the local students. As per the existing affiliation bye laws of the CBSE, the school affiliated or seeking affiliation with the Board shall have an 8,000 square meters of land. For the schools located in cities with a population exceeding 15 lakhs, the land requirement will be a minimum 4000 square meters. Secretary and Correspondent of Little Angels School at MVP Colony, Venu Mohan Manga, said the institute, which intends to obtain CBSE affiliation, needs to first get a no-objection from the education department in the prescribed format to forward it to the CBSE. “Then an inspection committee will be constituted with a principal from the Kendriya Vidyalaya as the convener. One private school principal will be part of the committee as the member. The schools seeking affiliation must satisfy the conditions pertaining to classrooms, science, computer and mathematics laboratories, space for extracurricular activities, playground and other basic amenities like toilets, drinking water, etc.,” said Venu Mohan. Venu Mohan further added that the inspection committee will look into various components such as physical infrastructure as well as teacher-pupil ratio, qualifications of teaching staff, defined roles and responsibilities, etc. Narava Prakasa Rao, Convenor of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Forum, opined that Andhra Pradesh can launch the CBSE system on a pilot basis in the major government schools in the first phase. “It will give a comprehensive insight into how the students and teachers are embracing or coping up with the new system. In this way, the shortcomings can be addressed before emulating the CBSE model in other schools,” said Prakasa Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/affiliation-syllabus-hiccups-loom-for-states-cbse-plan/articleshow/87129368.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation kicks off drive to raze rickety buildings in and around Burrabazar||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has started a demolition drive to ensure the safety of the tenants in the city’s dangerous dilapidated buildings. Four deaths that occurred due to the collapse of some portions of dilapidated buildings in a radius of 1.5km in Burrabazar in a gap of 10 days prompted the civic body to conduct the demolition drive. According to a KMC buildings department official, the drive is being conducted largely in the areas like Cotton Street, Rabindra Sarani, MG Road, Ahiritolla that are located in and around the Burrabazar belt. The Section 411 (4) of the KMC building rules empowers the civic body to demolish the extremely dilapidated portions of a building for the safety of its inmates. Some executive engineers want to take the advantage of this rule in the wake of the collapse of several dangerous buildings. Though KMC has planned the drive across north, central and parts of south Kolkata, the focus area for the time being remains Burrabazar and its adjacent neighbourhoods like Chitpore, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Jorasanko, Ahiritolla among other places. “We were particularly worried over the fate of the pedestrians after two of them were killed recently after the balcony of a four-storied building collapsed on them,” said a KMC official. However, highly insecure buildings in other parts of north and central Kolkata and in some parts of south Kolkata will also be inspected, said a KMC building department official. The civic decision to raze insecure buildings will necessitate the formation of a demolition squad, felt a KMC buildings department executive engineer. According to him, a proposal to form such a squad had been mooted last year, but it remained on paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-kicks-off-drive-to-raze-rickety-buildings-in-and-around-burrabazar/articleshow/87120117.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Nagpur||Civic body to set up GPS-based control room to improve SWM||Nagpur: To improve door-to-door garbage collection, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to set up a GPS-based control room at all the 10 zonal offices. “The GPS-enabled control room will not only track garbage collection vehicles but will also keep a check on the movement of sanitary workers,” deputy commissioner Rajesh Bhagat told TOI. “Both sanitary workers’ GPS based wrist-watches and GPS-enabled garbage lifting vehicles will be integrated in the control room,” he said. On Monday, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and Bhagat convened a meeting with zonal teams of solid waste management officials, including health officers and sanitary inspectors. Almost two years after the NMC replaced Kanak Resources Management Limited with two new firms — AG Environ and BVG India, the door-to-door garbage collection has deteriorated instead of improving. TOI has been constantly highlighting the poor state of solid waste management in the city. “Even the flying squad formed by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B to inspect all the 10 zones endorsed that door-to-door garbage collection is dismal in many localities,” said Bhagat. At many places, garbage-collecting vehicles did not make daily visits and garbage was being collected twice or thrice a week, he said. Many residents have also expressed concern over the timing of garbage-collection vehicles. According to the feedback of people, Laxmi Nagar and Dhantoli residents want garbage collection vehicles early in the morning, while residents of other zones prefer the vehicles to come after 9am. The irregularity in door-to-door garbage collection, inconvenience of the timings of residents and black spots in the city have increased, admitted Bhagat. “The issue of garbage collection vehicles falling short has also come to the fore. The NMC has asked AG and BVG – the two garbage collection firms – to increase garbage collection vehicles by 20 each,” said Bhagat. Currently, AG has 201 vehicles, excluding 72 rickshaws, while BVG has a fleet of 198 vehicles and 115 rickshaws. Rickshaws are being used to cover mostly slums and congested areas across the city, including Itwari, Mahal and Gandhibagh. “With the control room, the NMC will keep a tab on the movement of all garbage lifting vehicles in all the 10 zones,” he said. Payments to both the contractors will be linked with the feedback of the control rooms. The control room will also track sanitary workers of their respective zones. This will be done with the help of the GPS-based wrist watches given to them. At present, sanitary workers are only sweeping streets allotted to them. The NMC has also decided to utilize the 7,000-odd sanitary workers for cleaning road dividers, footpaths, playgrounds, parks etc, he said. The NMC will also tighten the noose around irregular sanitary workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/civic-body-to-set-up-gps-based-control-room-to-improve-swm/articleshow/87115665.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

A stern warning from the UP government and deployment of heavy police force failed to deter farmers from answering the call for a nationwide ‘Rail Roko’ by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to demand immediate suspension of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. In Muzaffarnagar, farmers staged dharna on the railway tracks at Mansoorpur railway station, leaving Amritsar-Delhi Express stranded. Similarly, Sidhbali Express was halted at Bijnor. The rail-roko Andolan began at 10am on Monday and continued for six hours. In Meerut, farmers sat on dharna at Kankerkhera and Partapur railway tracks. In many places, however, the protest was symbolic in nature and trains ran without obstruction. According to ADM city (Muzaffarnagar), Amit Singh, “Farmers had staged protests at two railway stations — Khatauli and Mansoorpur. A train was stopped at 11:30am. But farmers were not sitting on the tracks and after talks they agreed that no trains would be stopped, but railway authorities halted the trains due to security reasons.” In Bijnor, Digambar Singh, a senior BKU leader, said, “Our rail-roko andolan was quite successful and we stopped a train at Maizampur railway station.” Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh, however, said heavy police force was deployed at railway stations and no train was stopped. The administration downplayed the impact of the agitation, with the UP ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar claiming that no trains were stopped in the state. Kumar said, "The agitation was more or less symbolic in nature and no trains were stopped in the state. To prevent any aggressiveness, we had deployed 160 companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and nine companies of paramilitary forces at railway stations. Besides, senior police and administrative officials were regularly in touch with farmer leaders to ensure peace.” In Uttarakhand’s Rudrapur, farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) reached the railway station which lies under the jurisdiction of Bilaspur police of UP and sat on the tracks at 10 am. District president of BKU (Chashni), Sahab Singh Sekhon, said, “We demand immediate dismissal of Union minister Ajay Mishra as he can influence the probe underway against his son.” As soon as 'Garib Rath' from Delhi to Kathgodam arrived at the station at 12 noon, the farmers laid down on the tracks, forcing the loco pilot to stop the train. The protesting farmers were forcefully removed from the tracks and the train left for Kathgodam. Circle officer of Bilaspur police, Anoop Chaudhary, said that the train was stopped for five minutes as per its normal halt. “We ensured smooth passage of the Garib Rath as farmers were removed from the tracks,” he said.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt grants gratuity to retired RSRTC employees||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday gave his nod to the long-pending demand of retired employees of Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation (RSRTC) by granting gratuity to those who retired after 2016. RSRTC comes under corporations with different service rules for its employees and have denied them gratuity and other benefits. The decision will cost around Rs 470 crore to the exchequer. “The pending sum should be given in one instalment,” said Gehlot. This would mean that those who retired in 2016 will get gratuity at one go. This is considered a big decision as it was pending from the previous BJP government. As per a report, over 5,500 employees of the RSRTC have retired since 2016 and have been denied retirement benefits. The reason given was the poor financial condition of RSRTC. The RSRTC Employees' Association has been demanding the benefits since 2016. The move came days ahead of a statewide bandh call given by RSRTC employees on October 27 to press for their demands. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, who joined the meeting from Udaipur, urged Gehlot to implement the 7th Pay Commission to RSRTC employees. Replying to it, Gehlot asked RSRTC officials present at the meeting to submit a proposal to the finance department. “It was the BJP government that took benefits away from RSRTC officials due to their mismanagement. Now, the employees have been given their due, restoring their faith in the government,” said Khachariyawas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-govt-grants-gratuity-toretired-rsrtc-employees/articleshow/87122358.cms||---

While Amur falcon has been spotted this year before its scheduled time of arrival in Bengal, a resident of south and south-eastern China, red-billed starling, has been spotted for the first time in Bengal in the recent times. On one of the Puja days, birdwatchers sighted the red-billed starling in the Sunderbans. “I have never heard of its sighting in Bengal in the recent past. At least, there is nothing on record till date. I spotted it in the Pirkhali area of the Sunderbans,” said Nityananda Choukidar, a guide and an avid bird watcher. “In the past 20 days, there have been sightings of peregrine falcon — the fastest member of animal kingdom — in the Sunderbans. Eurasian Hobby has also been spotted,” he said. On October 11, two Amur falcons were sighted by birdwatchers in Midnapore. This raptor of the falcon family normally breeds in south eastern Siberia and northern China and migrates to South Africa and East Africa. These birds undertake a yearly journey of more than 20,000 kilometres between their wintering and breeding grounds. During the journey they stop at Nagaland and then fly again along the coastal areas in the eastern India to Maharashtra and finally cross the Arabian Sea. Some groups even cross the Indian Ocean and fly over Sri Lanka. “A few Amur falcons were spotted near Mandarmani in 2016. They could have lost their way and become vagrants. The next sighting was reported in October near Chandrakona,” said Aishik Das, a birdwatcher. According to Sujan Chatterjee, secretary of the Birdwatchers’ Society, migratory birds start arriving from the middle of September. “Wagtail, snipe, sandpiper are the common birds that are found in Kolkata and areas adjoining the city. Amur falcon normally flies over Bengal in November. This sighting is a little before the scheduled time,” Chatterjee said. Joydip Kundu, a member of state’s wildlife advisory board, felt that the habitat of these birds has to be conserved in order to keep these guests visiting us every year. “Climate change is inevitable and that might impact the movement of the migratory birds. While spotting a new species is exciting, we have to conserve the habitat for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/birding-season-starts-with-rare-sunderbans-sighting/articleshow/87120159.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Delhi||East Delhi Municipal Corporation readies action plan to fight pollution all year round||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation launched a year-long action plan against air pollution in areas under its jurisdiction. Department officials have accordingly been given responsibility for managing road dust, construction and demolition dust, open waste burning, biomass burning, solid waste management and industrial emission control. Track the pollution level in your cityAdditional staff will be deployed to oversee these in the winter months from October to March. “The idea is to avoid delays in implementing initiatives for pollution mitigation,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. Our endeavour is to improve the overall environmental condition in EDMC areas. We will upload the action plan on our website and people can see the contact details of officials responsible for the implementation of individual plans.” Anand added, “With the contact number of the officials available, now any resident can report pollution-generating activity to them. The plan will also be updated from time to time with more initiatives.” A specific winter activity will be to sweep the 162.2km of roads less than 60ft wide and 120km of those above 60ft of dust. For roads wider than 60ft, 10 mechanised road-sweepers, each equipped with water sprinklers, will be used and the targeted road length to be covered per day is 350-400km. Sanitation workers will manually sweep the narrower roads. Every day, 16,000 litres of treated water will be used to sprinkle the roads and settle the dust. A dust control and management cell has been set to monitor and implement the road dust control measures. Officers on a special duty will carry out a survey to identify the locations of garbage and C&D waste dumping and burning while coordinating with other agencies on the removal of such material. They will also act against identified polluters and to attend to complaints received on social media. Long-term measures initiated include installing at least one fixed or mobile compactor and one material recovery facility in each ward for the biomining of 50 lakh tonne of legacy waste and disposal of excavated material. Reclamation of land and construction of a sanitary landfill is another step as is setting up a leachate treatment plant at Ghazipur. Bulk waste generators and owners or builders have been ordered to dispose of their construction and demolition waste at the processing plant in Shastri Park or face penalties. Collaboration with agencies and NGOs for improving the environmental conditions is also part of the long-term steps. The action plan notes, for example, that TERI has been active in educating the bulk solid waste generators about the need for segregating and processing of waste and informing them about technology available for such work. The Air Pollution Action Group (APAG) has also been roped in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-readies-action-plan-to-fight-pollution-all-year-round/articleshow/87120132.cms||Vibha Sharma

The trains that were affected include New Delhi-Amritsar Shatabdi Express, which was halted near Shambhu in Punjab as protesters blocked railway tracks near Sahnewal and Rajpura. The chief public relation officer (CPRO) of Northern Railway said at least 60 trains were regulated till 2pm and 25 short-distance passenger trains were cancelled. As the six-hour protest, which started at 10am, came to an end by 4pm, the section started getting cleared and, by 5 pm, train services had resumed, the CPRO said. As most of the Rajdhanis arrive in Delhi between 10am and 11am, and Shatabdis mostly depart early in the morning, only the trains operating during the day were partially affected. No major impact of the protest was, however, visible at any major station in Delhi as platforms remained scantly occupied during the afternoon. The other affected trains include New Delhi-Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra Vande Bharat Express, Una Himachal-New Delhi Jan Shatabdi, Delhi-Pathankot Express, Hazrat Nizamuddin-Kota Jan Shatabdi Express, Fazilka-Delhi Express, Shri Ganganagar-Delhi Special, New Delhi-Moga Shatabdi, New Delhi-Amritsar Shan-e-Punjab Express, and Kathgodam-Delhi Special. Chandigarh-Ferozepur Express got stuck at Ludhiana due to a blockade in the Ferozpur-Ludhiana section. The CPRO of North Western Railway said train movement on the Bhiwani-Rewari, Sirsa-Rewari, Loharu-Hisar, Suratgarh-Bathinda, Sirsa-Bathinda, Hanumangarh-Bathinda, Rohtak-Bhiwani, Rewari-Sadulpur, Hisar-Bathinda, Hanumangarh-Sadulpur and Sri Ganganagar-Rewari sections was affected. Bathinda-Rewari Special and Sirsa-Ludhiana Special were cancelled, he said. The route of Ahmedabad-Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra Special was changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rail-roko-protests-fail-to-have-much-of-an-impact-on-train-operations-in-delhi/articleshow/87120204.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nashik||Man held for assaulting constable||Nashik: The Mumbai Naka police have arrested a 38-year-old man on the charges of assaulting a police constable in the Indiranagar area of the city. Two of his family members were also booked. The constable attached to the control room and a few other police personnel were patrolling the Indiranagar area on Saturday night. When the patrolling team was passing through the Indiranagar underpass, they found that a few motorists were entering the underpass from the wrong side, which is from Govind Nagar towards Indiranagar. As wrong side driving can lead to accidents, the constable and other police personnel got down from their vehicle and stopped motorists from using the underpass from the wrong side. At around 11.30 pm, a person driving a car entered the underpass from the wrong side. When the policemen stopped him, he started arguing with the constable and abused him physically and verbally. The constable decided to take him to the police station. The two women from the family of the motorist stopped the constable from taking him to the police station. Hence, the police also booked them under various sections of the IPC. With the possibility of accidents and traffic snarls, a few years ago, the police barred motorists from using the underpass from Govindnagar side to Indiranagar side.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/man-held-for-assaulting-constable/articleshow/87115669.cms||---
---||Ajmer||E-registration fraud: Three Jaipur department officials removed||AJMER: The department of registration and stamps removed three sub-registrars of Jaipur from their posts after finding financial impropriety and misuse of the online government receipts accounting system or e-GRAS on Monday which resulted in a revenue loss of nearly Rs 8 crore. Seven clerks of the registration department have been put under await posting orders (APOs) and show-cause notices issued to 44 employees. Licences of 19 stamp vendors from Jaipur have also been cancelled after uncovering the scam. Inspector general of registration and stamps Mahveer Parsad said that Sadhna Sharma, sub-registrar, Jaipur; Rajeev Badgujjar, deputy registrar; and Savita Sharma, executive-sub registrar, have been moved with immediate effect to Rajasthan revenue board. The action was taken after it was found that e-GRAS challans were reused to register documents without paying fees. The department's technical team checked the reuse of e-GRAS challan for e-registration and made a list of such challans. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) provided a list of 913 such suspected documents registered by reusing challans. A committee constituted to calculate the loss to the revenue department filed a report nailing 17 sub-registrar offices which had registered 676 such documents, resulting in a revenue loss of Rs 7.94 crore. These documents were sent to recover the revenue loss caused by officials and act departmentally against carelessness and register criminal cases. The department has recovered Rs 2.28 crore from 218 such cases and 447 of them are pending. The high-level committee tasked to identify the causes found that stamp vendors had deliberately reused challans for registering new documents and department officials had failed to verify the same. The three sub-registrars of Jaipur have been removed from their post for their carelessness. Other than the three, registration clerks Babu Lal Meena, Sushil Kumar Sharma, Balbeer Singh Dhayal, Anupam Singh, Ashok Kuar Upreti, Deepak Hingonia and Shamlal Kumawat of Jaipur have been put on APO. Similarly, 44 clerks have also been served show-cause notices. Licenses of 19 stamp vendors in Jaipur have been cancelled and the department will register FIRs against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/e-registrationfraud-three-deptofficials-removed/articleshow/87122416.cms||---
---||Nashik||Jumping traffic signal common in Nashik city||NASHIK: Motorists jumping traffic signals and violating one-way entry rule have become common sights in many parts of the city. These violations have also often led to accidents and traffic jams in various parts of Nashik city. There are close to 50 road signals in various parts of the city. Police personnel are deployed at important junctions where traffic signals have been set up. But there is a rampant violation of traffic rules at signals where the police personnel are not present. Many motorists, who use the road between Mumbai Naka and the Pounrima signal, said very few follow the signal at the Nagji Cowk since there is no police at the junction. During the peak hour, mainly in the evening, motorists often jump the road signal under the watch of police personnel. Traffic personnel at one of the city junctions said they click the pictures of the motorists, who jump the signal and issue an e-challans. Generally, the police do not chase the motorists on the streets as it could endanger the lives of other motorists. Seetaram Gaikwad, the assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “The police are continuously taking action against motorists, indulging in signal jumping cases along with other traffic violations” This year, till September-end over 10,000 motorists have been challaned for jumping signals. The proposal to suspend the driving licenses of many such motorists have also been sent. The situation is similar to wrong side driving or violating the one-way traffic rule in certain parts of the city. Senior traffic officials said driving on the wrong side or breaking the one-way traffic rule leads to accidents as motorists are startled on suddenly seeing a vehicle coming from the other side, which they were not expecting. More than 17,000 motorists have been booked for wrong side driving or breaking the one-way entry rule till September end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/jumping-traffic-signal-common-in-nashik-city/articleshow/87115699.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Delhi||Gopal Rai switches on ‘gaadi off’ campaign||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai launched the 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign from ITO crossing on Monday. Offering motorists roses, Rai called upon all drivers to switch off their car engines when the traffic light turned red and they halted at the intersections. During the launch of the new anti-pollution campaign, Civil Defence volunteers distributed pamphlets containing the chief minister's appeal to the people, in which Arvind Kejriwal appealed to vehicle owners to turn off their vehicles when the red light was on and to forego using their cars once a week to contribute to the fight against pollution. He also requested them to download the Green Delhi mobile app on their phones. Rai said according to Petroleum Conservation Research Association data, if people successfully followed the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign, vehicular pollution could go down 13-20%. “The pollution level is increasing now due to the changing weather and harvest stubble burning. With the incidents of stubble burning increasing in the neighbouring states, the air pollution in Delhi is also increasing rapidly,” said Rai. “We cannot do anything to stop the farm fires in the other states. That's why our effort is to reduce vehicular pollution in Delhi for some relief.” The environment minister said this campaign could forge ahead only with public participation. “If we all fight together, only then will we be able to reduce pollution,” he said. Police and Civil Defence volunteers have been deployed at 100 road intersections across the city. Of these, there will be a special focus on 10 intersections. The campaign will conclude on November 18. Rai also disclosed that Delhi held a joint meeting with the Union minister of environment and the environment ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. “Delhi government has taken up the responsibility right from the preparation of the IARI’s bio-decomposer solution to help manage the harvest remnants,” he claimed. “Had other state governments taken up the responsibility, the stubble wouldn’t be burning right now. The other state governments did not discharge their responsibility completely. Stubble burning is increasing rapidly in the neighbourhood, causing an increase in the air pollution in Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gopal-rai-switches-on-gaadi-off-campaign/articleshow/87120178.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Badvel bypoll: Parties pull out all stops as polling day nears||VIJAYAWADA: Leaders of the YSRC, BJP and Congress — the three major political parties contesting the by-election to Badvel assembly constituency in Kadapa district — have intensified their campaign as the day of polling gets closer. The BJP has promised voters greater share of Krishna river water for Rayalaseema if its candidate Punthala Suresh wins the by-election. Monitoring the party’s campaign is BJP state unit president Somu Veerraju, who is camping in the constituency. Senior party leaders C M Ramesh and C Adinarayana Reddy, among others, are also meeting voters across the constituency. The BJP leadership is hoping to corner the votes of the TDP and Jana Sena that are not contesting the by-election. Somu Veerraju is meeting several TDP leaders and seeking their support. The Congress, which is fielding its former MLA P M Kamalamma in the by-election, has also launched its campaign with senior leaders closely monitoring the campaign. The party, which lost its presence in the state after bifurcation in 2014, is working hard to make its presence felt among voters. On its part, the ruling YSRC has deployed its top leaders, including some ministers, to monitor the campaign. The party is targeting a majority of one lakh votes this time and is accordingly tailoring its strategy. The party secured a majority of 45,000 votes in the 2019 general elections, which was 60.89% of the total votes polled, when Dr Venkata Subbaiah won the elections. This time, with Venkata Subbaiah’s widow fighting her first election, the party is focusing on a big victory. Deputy chief minister Amzad Basha, who campaigned for the party candidate on Monday, said only the YSRC has the right to seek votes as it had fulfilled 95% of the promises it had made ahead of the 2019 general elections. Discounting the promises being made by the BJP and the Congress, he said the two parties have lost their presence and relevance in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/parties-pull-out-all-stops-as-polling-day-nears/articleshow/87117935.cms||Gopi Dara

Patole said the three-party government made it difficult to choose heads of corporations and academies. “But we are committed to upholding secular values.” Naseem Khan alleged the previous BJP government had stopped several schemes the Congress government had launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-is-ignoring-state-muslims-says-assn-to-patole/articleshow/87122978.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Kolkata||Heritage talks spring hope for Italian restaurant revival||Kolkata: Resurrection of Peliti’s restaurant, which used to be a landmark Italian restaurant on Old Court House Street opposite Governor’s house, may be a kick-off point for a long-term Bengal-Italy cooperation in heritage regeneration in Kolkata. City police chief Soumen Mitra, who has been instrumental in restoration of many police heritage buildings, showed a keen interest in taking part in the revival of a precious piece of the city’s cosmopolitan history at an event on heritage conservation in the city on Monday. Vincenzo de Luca, Ambassador of Italy, said, “The restoration of Peliti can be a good starting point for Bengal-Italy cooperation in the heritage regeneration of the city which should assume a movement involving stakeholders from different institutions as it happened in the heritage movement in cities like Bologna and Naples.” Mitra promptly assured an active cooperation in the restoration and preservation of such buildings. Earlier, professor Tathagata Chatterjee, an urban management and governance expert, set the tone of the symposium at Bengal Chamber of Commerce by mentioning Peliti to refer to the long connection of Kolkata with Italy. He also referred to Italian architectural influence on the city’s colonial buildings. Chevalier Federico Peliti, a master chef, started his restaurant and confectionery business in 1870. Famous for the three-course lunch, the restaurant was also known for 12-ft high replica of the Eiffel Tower in sugar, crafted by Peliti himself in December 1889. It was here that Rotary Club of Calcutta was born in 1919. The building is now in a shambles and needs urgent restoration. Luca promised to share the famous Italian experience and expertise in the process of heritage regeneration. Mitra, Manish Chakraborty, a conservation architect, and G M Kapur, INTACH’s Bengal convenor, all advocated for the transfer of development right (TDR) in the state to save more and more heritage buildings, which have become liability for the property owners. In fact, the state government is also very keen in incorporating TDR in the building law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-talks-spring-hope-for-italian-restaurant-revival/articleshow/87120238.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

District fire officials received a call around 8 pm informing them about the fire at a stock yard. Soon, a fire tender was called in from Vijayawada and then two more units were pressed into service from Ajit Singh Nagar as fire fighters struggled for hours to douse the flames. Officials said the firm - ELIM Coconut Industries - processes dried coconuts into various reusable products such as charcoal, bags and ropes. After dousing the fire, officials took stock of damage. Police said loss is estimated at Rs 30 lakh. Preliminary investigation by Gannavaram police and fire officials suggests that an electrical short circuit in the main electrical panel could be the reason for the mishap. A case has been registered at Gannavaram police station. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fire-at-coconut-unit-causes-rs-30-lakh-loss/articleshow/87117977.cms||---

---||Delhi||GRAP Measures Come Into Force For ‘Poor’ To ‘Moderate’ Category||New Delhi: With air quality predicted to touch the “moderate” to “poor” range between October 21 and 24, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday enforced certain measures under this category of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) with immediate effect. CPCB has also asked the implementing agencies to be prepared for implementation of actions under the “very poor” category. A senior official said, “Stringent measures under the very poor or severe category of GRAP have not yet been enforced in Delhi-NCR as the air quality is better than last year. We have asked the implementing agencies to be ready for taking action under the very poor category.” In its order to Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, CBCP directed that the agencies concerned ensure that all brick kilns remain closed in Delhi-NCR, ensure periodic mechanised sweeping or water sprinkling on roads and strictly enforce orders of Supreme Court and NGT regarding firecrackers. Most measures implemented in Delhi-NCR are strict enforcement of existing directions to control polluting activities. These include stopping garbage burning in landfills and other places and imposition of heavy fines on people responsible, enforcement of pollution control regulations in industries and thermal power plants, enforcing rules for dust control during construction activities and closure of non-compliant sites, strict vigilance and enforcement of PUC norms and no tolerance for visible emissions, like stopping plying of visibly polluting vehicles. The agencies have also been asked to ensure the Supreme Court order on diversion of non-destined truck traffic is followed and only trucks registered after 2005 are allowed entry into Delhi and cops are deployed for smooth traffic flow at identified vulnerable areas. The measures were enforced on the suggestions of a sub-committee formed by Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region. The panel, which conducted two meetings on October 12 and 18, gave recommendations after reviewing the meteorological and air quality forecast. CPCB has advised people to check air polluting activities, including keeping updated PUC certificates, keeping vehicle engines tuned, maintaining proper air pressure in tyres, adherence to lane driving, optimising use of private vehicles, not disposing waste in the open and reporting air pollution activities through SAMEER app, social media platforms and other public grievance portals. The usual GRAP measures under the “very poor” category include a ban on diesel generator sets and stopping use of coal or firewood in hotels and open eateries. The severe plus or emergency measures include ban on construction activities, stopping entry of trucks (except essential commodities) and introduction of odd-even scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/grap-measures-come-into-force-for-poor-to-moderate-category/articleshow/87120270.cms||---

Arora, the chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), ruled out any shortage of vaccines. He said the country would have about 90 crore doses available in the coming three months. “More vaccines will be added to the range of vaccines available in the country shortly,” he said.He said the future course of any wave would depend on vaccination, Covid-appropriate behaviour, the percentage of the population exposed to natural infection during the second wave and of course, the possibility of emergence of any new variants. He said the health system preparedness was an essential part of the fight against any future upsurge of cases. He said, “The Covid vaccines are very effective in preventing serious disease for the current variants. They may be effective on future variants as well. Efforts are on from the manufacturers’ side to modify the vaccines for emerging variants of concern.” Expressing concern over lack of data on the current vaccines’ effectiveness on variants, virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, a member of the Covid-19 working group and a professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said, “Without data, it is very difficult to know how our vaccines are working against variants or to think about what needs to be done for boosters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-new-variant-of-concern-seen-in-last-6-months-arora/articleshow/87120272.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Then, Deepak shot dead Paras before turning the gun on himself, police said. Sirohi said it was found that the duo had made multiple calls before ending their lives. Deepak made a call to his girlfriend and asked her to switch to video phone call so that she could see him dying but she did not do so.

---||Goa||Short domestic season is the biggest problem in Indian football: Stimac||Panaji: The results may not have been encouraging, but national coach Igor Stimac asked journalists to speak with his players to know the difference he has made during his time in India. “You will see how much they enjoy training sessions and the games,” Stimac told reporters on Tuesday. “Results are not always as we wished, but I can see happiness. I can see they are enjoying, because we are trying to play football.” Till the SAFF Championship triumph on Saturday, Stimac was under pressure to deliver. In 22 matches under the Croatian, the team has now won six times, all against lower-ranked teams, including three last week. India have famously drawn against Qatar, defended strongly with 10-men against the Asian champions, then failed to defeat Bangladesh and Afghanistan twice, Nepal and Sri Lanka once. It is this inconsistency that sticks out. “The fans and media all want change to happen overnight, but that's not happening in football, particularly with the national team. We cannot have a budget to buy players (unlike clubs). We have to rely on what we get from the domestic league,” said Stimac. The Croatian was hired more than two years ago to deliver attractive football and take this team to the Asian Cup again. India are still on that path, but the coach warned progress would be slow, unless there are changes to the domestic structure. “Because of the pandemic, we cannot count on a season that goes on for eight or nine months. That’s the biggest problem in Indian football,” said Stimac. India’s top-tier, the Indian Super League (ISL), has 11 teams and provides 20 matches in a regular season that is wrapped up inside four months. The other divisions have even fewer games. ISL has expansion plans with 30 games a season for all teams. Each one will play the other three times. The Covid-19 pandemic though has meant the league will now be played inside a bio-secure bubble for the second successive year in Goa. “Unless we have changes, players will come to national camps after (being) off-season. That does not help. It’s terrible to waste time on strength conditioning programme and upgrade the fitness level of players, instead of working on the game plan and tactical points. “Lack of competitive games for our players is a big handicap. Short season, as we all know, affects their muscle strength. When players are not in controlled and supervised training process throughout 10 months of the year, you cannot expect great things from them. You can only expect injuries,” said Stimac. The national team will not play any friendlies during the November international window and instead get together for the third round of AFC Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers on February 1. “We need to sit down with other stakeholders in our domestic competitions and discuss how much time the national team will get for preparations for the qualifiers. If we get enough time to prepare, we can expect good football and good results. Otherwise, it’s a gamble,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/short-domestic-season-is-the-biggest-problem-in-indian-football-stimac/articleshow/87144561.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Bus stations in all major cities across the state registered huge turnout of passengers on Sunday which also continued on Monday. The APSRTC planned to operate 4,000 special services before and after Dasara festival. Special services were planned from the weekend prior to the festival keeping in view of the holidays given to the educational institutions. However, the demand from passengers was poor before the festival. The APSRTC had to cancel some of the special services before the festival. Among the 1,800 services planned before the festival, nearly 70 per cent of the buses were cancelled. But when it comes to post Dasara, APSRTC witnessed huge demand starting from Sunday afternoon. Tickets in regular services and special services were sold out and serpentine queues were seen at booking counters in Vijayawada on Sunday night. The demand for buses continued on Monday also. The APSRTC officials are expecting the rush to continue for next two days. The officials observed that people came to their native places according their convenience before the festival and the rush was evenly distributed through seven days resulting in poor demand for buses. “Post Dasara, people are in a hurry to return to work on Monday resulting in sudden spike in demand for buses,” said officials. The APSRTC operated all 2,200 special services planned for post festival rush with full occupancy. Meanwhile, Hyderabad highway witnessed huge traffic on Sunday evening and Monday. Even after the rush was cleared by allocating additional lanes at toll plazas, traffic jams were observed on Vijayawada-Hyderabad highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rtc-regains-lost-festival-patronage-post-dasara/articleshow/87118077.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The seven villages include Jalgaon, Thorgaon and Jivhale in Niphad taluka, Manoli and Mungsara in Nashik, Aghar in Malegaon and Talegaon in Trimbakeshwar talukas. These villages have registered 100% vaccination of beneficiaries, said Dr Shailesh Nikam, the Nashik taluka health officer and the in-charge of vaccination for Nashik rural. The elected representatives along with the health and government officials carried out awareness and vaccination of the beneficiaries in the villages during the Kawach Kundal mission, launched by the state government from October 8 to October 14. The gram panchayat of the respective villages have issued the certificate to the health department about 100 % vaccination after tallying the same with the electoral roll. “There are 1,966 villages across Nashik district and the vaccination across most of the villages is now in the range of 75% to 95%,” Nikam said. All the seven villages have an eligible population of 13,200 beneficiaries. On hesitancy against the vaccine, the health officials said besides misinformation spread through social media, the farmers and workers were against it fearing illness for a longer period. “Since the people feared illness, we carried out awareness among them and special sessions of vaccination were conducted,” said Motilal Patil, taluka health officer of Trimbakeshwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/all-eligible-beneficiaries-got-at-least-1-dose-in-7-nashik-villages/articleshow/87115803.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Upscale neighbourhoods worst affected by dengue, reveals Pune Municipal Corporation report||PUNE: Some of the upscale localities in Aundh-Baner, Ghole Road-Shivajinagar, Dhole Patil Road and Ahmednagar Road-Wadgaonsheri ward limits have been hit hardest by dengue this year, the latest report of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has revealed. The dengue cases gripped all the 16 municipal ward limits across the city by early August, with the infection reaching its peak by September in the wake of the extended monsoon, intermittent spells, rainwater accumulation and poor upkeep of the city. The cases started declining once the October heat set in, experts said. Private hospitals (2,254 cases) and government-designated sentinel (463 cases) centres have collectively registered 2,717 dengue cases this year so far. The PMC areas had recorded almost 3,000 dengue cases last year. Among them, the maximum 2,477 cases were recorded during the post-monsoon period from September and December. “Citizens living in the housing societies in the upmarket areas have been badly hit by dengue this year. In a sizable number of these housing societies, the breeding spots of the dengue-causing mosquito was found on the premises. In many cases, such breeding spots were found inside the houses of the dengue-infected residents,” Sanjeev Wavre, head of the PMCs’s insect control department, said. PMC stepped up the measures to destroy breeding spots on a war footing from June this year. “Citizens should also do their bit to keep their surroundings clean,” Wavre said. Besides destroying mosquito-breeding sites, developing a mechanism to keep mid-city rivers flowing and hyacinth-free would also help keep the city mosquito-free, the experts said. “Rivers that flow through the city need utmost upkeep to keep them flowing. Stagnation of water due to accumulating hyacinth or low water depth resulting from the accumulation of silt can result in water stagnation, which provides conducive ground for mosquito breeding,” said health activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More. Filling up vacant posts of entomologists/biologists and sanitary inspectors is also the key to contain the diseases. “Besides, they need to rope in either an adequate number of permanent or contractual staff for identifying mosquito breeding and destroying these sites during the dengue transmission period between June and October,” More said. Most-hit ward areasAn analysis of the ward-wise distribution of dengue cases has revealed that the residents of Ghole Road-Shivajinagar, Nagar Road-Wadgaonsheri, Yerawada-Kalas Dhanori, Dhankawdi-Sahakaragar, Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Kasba-Vishrambaugwada, Aundh-Baner and Tilak Road-Sinhagad Road have been worst affected by the mosquito-borne diseases this year. PMC officials have intensified surveillance and prevention measures in these wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/upscale-neighbourhoods-worst-affected-by-dengue/articleshow/87120324.cms||Umesh Isalkar

They will have to give the waste in the dustbin to the garbage collection vans coming to their areas. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has already issued an order in this connection and those flouting the order will be fined Rs 2,000. Directives have been given to the divisional sanitary inspectors and sanitary inspectors to create awareness about the new norms among the vendors before slapping fines. NMC officials said, “We have observed that many vendors place waste along the road after doing business.” “This is making the city dirty. Jadhav has taken the serious cognizance of this and has decided to make dustbin mandatory for hawkers and vendors,” said NMC officials. “Initially, we will focus on creating awareness about the new rule among the vendors and hawkers instead of immediately slapping fines on the violators,” said the officials. At present, NMC has around 1,800 sanitary workers involved in cleaning the cities. As many as 700 sanitary workers have also been outsourced to deal with the shortage of workforce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dustbins-must-for-hawkers-vendors/articleshow/87115839.cms||Tushar Pawar

We are also going to check the final approvals and the gift deed and take a decision accordingly. We will also consult HMDA to verify the permission,” Manikonda municipal commissioner S Jayanth told TOI. According to the residents of Tirumala Hills colony, a gift deed was done in 1993 and this land is now a HUDA final approved layout. The total open space land is 8663 square yards out of which the biggest open space 6024 square yards has been allegedly encroached upon. When asked why the representations submitted by the colony residents have not been addressed for the past four years, the commissioner said that he was posted only recently and would now consider the matter. “We are requesting the collector to conduct a survey and fence the land that belongs to the government,” said Dr P Avinash, president, Tirumala Hills Welfare Association, Manikonda The colony association members also claimed that in the last two years, land grabbers had fabricated the documents and had applied for HUDA layout. “Our only request to the municipality authorities is to see that the open space which is government land is protected from land grabbers and is used as a park for the benefit of our children and future generations,” said M S Ranga Chary, general secretary, Tirumala Hills Welfare Association, Manikonda.

---||Hyderabad||Cost-to-curry ratio goes for a toss||HYDERABAD: Rising petrol and diesel prices coupled with crop damage in many states due to rains has set kitchen budgets on fire as prices of staple vegetables such as onions and tomatoes among others have doubled in the last two weeks. Analysis of figures shared by agriculture department indicates that one kilo of onions which cost Rs 30 on September 30 has now shot to Rs 48-50 and tomatoes which cost Rs 20 have increased to Rs 60 per kg in the retail market. Prices of ladyfinger, capsicum and brinjal are also in the range of Rs 60 per kg, making it difficult for people to sustain monthly budgets. “Prices of some basic vegetables have skyrocketed in the past few weeks. I am not buying vegetables in bulk as the quality is also slightly poor. Buying vegetables which don’t sustain for a week at such a high price makes no sense to me,” said Nirupama Mudiraj, a resident of Alwal. Some vegetables such as cauliflower are unavailable in many markets. “Cauliflower has almost become extinct. I get to enjoy ‘aalu gobi’ barely once a month as the vegetable is not even available in online stores,” said Vidya Ranjan, a resident of Nanakramguda. Considering more than 60% of vegetables in the city arrive from other states, sharp rise in diesel and petrol prices has burnt a hole in consumers pockets. Diesel and petrol prices remain on a record high between Rs 102 and Rs 111 in different states. On Monday, the Bowenpally market, which is one of the largest agricultural markets in Telangana, almost 20,419 quintal of vegetables arrived, of which 40% were from Telangana districts and 60% were from neighbouring states such as Karnataka and Maharashtra. “Primary reason for price rise is excessive rainfall that has damaged the crop in not only Telangana but also other states. We can expect prices to stabilise in another week or two. Once we start receiving vegetables from districts, prices are bound to fall,” said Srinivas Lokini, secretary, Bowenpally agricultural market committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cost-to-curry-ratio-goes-for-a-toss/articleshow/87119712.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Delhi||Delhi: Biodiversity parks make most of monsoon, harvest 1.4mn gallons||NEW DELHI: A recent ecological survey has revealed that 1.4 million gallons of rainwater was harvested by the seven biodiversity parks of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) during the monsoon season between July and September this year. The survey was carried out by the staff of the biodiversity parks. The amount of water stored in surface waterbodies of four biodiversity parks is close to 1,100 million gallons. Officials at the biodiversity parks said that the survey was conducted for the first time to ascertain the role of these parks in conservation of water resources in Delhi. The biodiversity parks harvest rainwater efficiently through canopies and ground vegetation, particularly diverse grasses. They store the harvested water and recharge the groundwater effectively. The DDA Biodiversity Parks with three-storeyed forest communities have canopies reaching to height of 35-45 feet and ,with some 1,500 species of plants, act as rainwater harvesters. “The precipitation that falls on the dense closed canopies of the three-storeyed forest communities absorb substantial quantities of rainwater and they slowly release the water from the canopy to the ground where infiltration takes place. The canopies act as a sponge in terms of retaining and releasing rainwater falling on the vegetation,” said CR Babu, professor emeritus, Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE), DU. Apart from forest canopies, the rock systems in some of the biodiversity parks like Northern Ridge, Aravalli, Tilpath and Tughlaqabad help in harvesting rainwater. "The precipitation that falls on the ground rapidly infiltrates through joints and cracks in the rock system and, finally, enters into groundwater aquifers, which is the source of water for large parts of south Delhi. Besides, there are recharging pits, shallow depressions and shallow valleys, where the surface runoff from the surrounding catchments enters into these low-lying depressions and recharge the ground aquifers. If these low-lying depressions have impervious layers, the water is stored and released slowly to the ground aquifer. These landscapes are covered with grasses and few shrubs and some scattered native trees,” said Babu. For calculating the amount of water harvested by these biodiversity parks, their surface area and the data of rainfall recorded during this monsoon were considered. Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist, Biodiversity Parks Programme, said: “The biodiversity parks help in recharging aquifers and reducing soil erosion.” These parks also contribute to the enhancement of the quality of environment, including filtering air pollutants, particularly PM10 and PM2.5 from both point and non-point sources. Shah Hussain, ecologist and scientist incharge, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, said: “The vegetation, plants and animals at the biodiversity parks form biomass. Besides, the vegetation acts as filters in trapping pollutants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/biodiversity-parks-make-most-of-monsoon-harvest-1-4mn-gallons/articleshow/87144620.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

According to the cane department, there are 119 sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh. Out of them, several mills are lagging behind in paying dues. The mills owe Rs 4,000 to the farmers, sources said. Exploiting the opportunity provided by defaulter mills, kolhu owners have started operation of their units. Farmers are left empty-handed and are "being compelled to sell their produce at throwaway prices". Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had increased the sugarcane SAP from Rs 325 to Rs 350 per quintal during the crushing season to woo the farmers ahead of the state election. But, due to the economic crisis, farmers are increasingly selling their crop to kolhus at Rs 250 and Rs 270 per quintal. Noteworthy, there are 5,700 kolhus and 300 crushers in the state, apart from the sugar mills. Some of these units manufacture jaggery. At present, sugar is being sold at Rs 3,600 per quintal while jaggery at Rs 4,200 per quintal in the market. National president of Azad Kisan Union, Rajendra Singh, told TOI, "Farmers are selling their crop to kolhus at throwaway prices as some mills have failed to pay sugarcane dues on time. Farmers are reeling under huge debts." "Besides, some farmers having more sugarcane crop than their supply sell their produce to kolhu as mills give limited supply tickets to them," Singh claimed. When contacted, additional cane commissioner, VK Shukla, said, "The government is committed to get the dues paid on time. Defaulter mills are being served with notices. Besides, we are focusing on the early operation of sugar mills for the convenience of farmers. Some mills have also scheduled their operations."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/facing-financial-crunch-farmers-forced-to-sell-produce-at-throwaway-prices/articleshow/87118162.cms||Harveer Dabas

What we also want to examine is the footage that was shot on seven cameras by the election officer. Immediately after the election, I had asked the election officer for it. He initially agreed but later said we would have to get court orders to be given access to that,” Prakash Raj told reporters at the school. Prakash Raj took the assistance of Jubilee hills police to enter the school premises. Election officer Krishna Mohan was also present. What made it easy was the fact that newly-elected MAA president Manchu Vishnu did not object to the demands of Prakash Raj to examine the CCTV footage. Vishnu was in Tirumala with his panel members who got elected. Answering questions from the media, he said Prakash Raj was free to examine the CCTV footage. “He can happily check the footage. The election was won democratically. Yes, tempers were high and both sides got emotional but nothing more than that happened,” Vishnu said. Prakash Raj, however, said they had some doubts. “I do not have a problem with Manchu Vishnu but I do have an issue with the election officer,” he said. In the election, Prakash Raj had lo,st the president’s post to Vishnu. On Prakash Raj’s charges that he was planning to change the by-laws of MAA to prevent non-Telugus from contesting the polls in future, Vishnu said: “There is no such proposal of as now. But, anything that is to done will be done in consultation with the seniors in the film industry and with the approval of the general body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prakash-raj-checks-cctv-footage/articleshow/87119838.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Ravindra, a resident of Jankipuram sector C, while talking to TOI said that he was unable to see the cow due to defunct streetlights in his area. “The streetlights in our area have been lying defunct for the past three months or so. Luckily, I was riding at a slow pace so when the cow collided with me, I did not get injured badly,” he said. Not only Jankipuram, but TOI in its reality check of some other areas, including Gomtinagar, Mahanagar, Aliganj, New Hyderabad, Alamabagh and Aashiana found the streetlights dysfunctional. The streetlights near PAC Headquarters in Mahanagar were also found dysfunctional. “Winter season is arriving and so will be the fog. It becomes immensely difficult to drive on the route even after our vehicle front lights are on.” A similar situation was found on Gurudwara Road in Aashiana. Madhu Singh, a resident, said, “It is risky to drive in dark as many times stray animals suddenly appear from nowhere leading to accidents, I also avoid dark areas when I go for walks as few people in my neighborhood have been targeted by some chain snatchers.’’ In New Hyderabad, where several housing societies are located, families have concerns about safety of children. Ritu, a resident, said, “Children sometimes cycle in the locality but roads are always dark. It is very unsafe.” TOI also found that few of the streetlights near Gomti Barrage at Gomtinagar were found to be non-operational. “The dysfunctional streetlights of the area get repaired within two to three days as it’s a VIP area. But, things get to square one after a few weeks,” said Nitish Maurya, a commuter.

---||Hyderabad||MAA row: Producers set to don role of icebreakers||Hyderabad: With the infighting in the Movie Artistes Association (MAA) spinning out of control and the image of the Telugu film industry taking a beating, film producers have decided to step in to do damage control. In all likelihood, a crucial meeting will be held on one of the Sundays in the next one month to break the ice. Industry sources said though a date for the meeting is yet to be fixed, it will depend on the availability of top heroes, producers, exhibitors and all those involved with filmmaking. The key meeting will be organised at the Filmnagar Cultural Centre. Confirming their initiatives, honorary secretary of Telugu Film Producers Council (TFPC) T Prasanna Kumar Reddy said it was necessary to show that the entire film industry was united. The meeting assumes significance in the wake of infighting among various clans, including Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu’s, during the recent MAA polls. Various associations and bodies associated with the film industry will also come together to put up a show of unity, Reddy said. “If there is a display of disunity, governments or officials in the government may tend to have a different attitude towards us. Especially when we approach Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments on demands that we have for the betterment of the industry,” he said. He said in the overall interest of the film industry, “it becomes necessary to show that we are united”. He further said, “Development of the film industry matters more than individual differences.” There will be representatives from all the associations, including Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, TFPC, the directors association, artistes association, writers association and the federation of film workers representing 24 crafts. Apart from the elected representatives of these organisations, seniors in the fraternity belonging to all the associations will be invited for the meeting. Notwithstanding the public spats that the artistes had during the MAA elections on October 10, bad blood continued to prevail with Prakash Raj’s panel quitting their posts in MAA. Prakash Raj also quit from MAA. “The differences displayed were only at a personal level because of the elections. Otherwise, everyone is a professional. It is this professionalism that we want to showcause when we approach the AP and Telangana governments on our demands,” Prasanna Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maa-row-producers-set-to-don-role-of-icebreakers/articleshow/87119811.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Kolkata||Kankulia victim transferred three flats to wife, children||Kolkata: Subir Chaki, who was found murdered at his Kankulia Road house on Sunday night, had transferred the ownership of his properties in Kolkata—each flat worth more than a crore—to his wife and children over the past two years. Police are yet to find out the reason behind his decision, neighbours and colleagues said his failing health might have had prompted the move. Chaki fell severly ill in 2019 and was even bedridden for a few days following a sodium-potassium imbalance. “His death is shocking. He was brilliant in studies and built a successful corporate career but that never led him away from his roots. We can’t even think of him having any enemies. Despite repeated queries from police, neither me nor any other family member could think of any suspect who could murder him,” Chaki’s cousin Mainak, HR head at a leading Indian transmission and distribution structures company, told TOI. Chaki was the MD of Kilburn Engineering, a Williamson Magor group entity. Apart from their family house on Kankulia Road, Chaki had two flats at Urbana on EM Bypass and a duplex at Uniworld City in New Town, where he lived with his wife, mother and mother-in-law. His son is settled in the UK and his daughter lives in Bangalore. His daughter and her family have come to New Town for Puja, and his son will arrive on Tuesday. Rabin Mondal, Chaki’s driver who was also killed, had been working for the family for the past 35 years and lived in the drivers’ quarters at the New Town complex. “Chaki was one of the first to own flats at Urbana. He had two apartments in Tower 1. While one of the flats was owned by him and his son, the other one was registered in the names of his wife and daughter. Two years ago, he requested for a change in registration and removed himself from the ownership. Now, none of the flats is in his name,” said an official at Urbana Facility Management. Chaki had also opted for a change in registration for Flat 003 at Horizon Tower of Uniworld City; he removed his name as the owner and re-registered his wife, Anuradha, as the sole owner. “Chaki was a jovial person with a golden heart. I met him even on Dashami evening when he and boudi (Anuradha) were at the pandal for Sindur khela,” said Debjani Mukherjee, a resident of Urbana, who was close to Chaki. At New Town’s Uniworld City, he was a founding member of the residents’ association and acted like a mentor to the group operating the association, advising them on everything, from legal to social responsibility-related issues. “He was a gem of a person with stupendous knowledge. In spite of his stature, he was rather down to earth, treated everyone equally and called a spade a spade. During the Puja, he shuttled between his two addresses. He was at our Puja with his mother in a wheelchair on Saptami evening,” said a neighbour at the New Town complex. A neighbour shared with TOI the last WhatsApp message Chaki had sent to the residents’ group during Puja, remembering how his father used to make him recite a small poem to ensure he could come back home if he got lost during the festival. The poem he shared was: “Naamti aamaar Subir Chaki/Sothyi kotha noyeko faaki/Baritey aache Urmila ma/Bari jodi jaantey chaao/Ballygunge Station e jaayo/Dokhin dikey ektu giya, Aatattor A Kankulia.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kankulia-victim-transferred-three-flats-to-wife-children/articleshow/87120361.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that on the occasion of Dasara, a group of friends were having a party in a lodge near Pumpwell Circle. They had booked a room in a lodge on October 14. A compromise meeting regarding an old quarrel during the party ended up in a fight leading to the death of Dhanush, 20, a resident of Pachanady, who was a painter, in the wee hours of Saturday. The arrested are Joyson, 21, a resident of Surathkal, Prameeth D, 24, of Jeppu Bappal, Karthik, 21, from Vamanjoor, Prajwal, 22, and Durgesh, 22, residents of Pachanady, the commissioner said. Shashi Kumar said initially a fight broke out between Joyson and Dhanush. In a fit of rage, Dhanush was allegedly assaulted with a sharp weapon on his chest by Joyson. Dhanush, who sustained injuries, was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared dead. To a query on the motive, the commissioner said the victim had the habit of speaking ill of women. “At the party, all the arrested had decided to warn Dhanush not to speak ill of women and young girls. However, Dhanush had his own rationale and refusd to see reason. In a fit of rage, Joyson assaulted Dhanush with a knife and while trying to flee from the room, the victim collapsed near the staircase of the lodge,” Shashi Kumar said. Of the five arrested, three have a criminal background with cases registered against them at various police stations in connection with rioting, assault, NDPS Act among others. While Prameeth has nine cases, Joyson and Karthik have two cases each at various police stations. None of them had a permanent job and did odd jobs for a living. They will be subjected to medical tests to ascertain whether they had consumed drugs when the incident occurred, he added. Kankanady town police had registered a case under sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 302 and 149 of the IPC for murder and other charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/five-held-for-stabbing-youngster-to-death-at-a-party/articleshow/87117613.cms||---

A global consortium of 13 universities and labs are participating in Facebook’s Ego4D project, which collected first-person footage from around the world to train next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) models. Explaining how the project could help in day-to-day life, researchers from IIIT-H said that a wearable device with first-person vision could do something as simple as helping in finding a missing key or stopping a person from putting extra salt in a dish. It could also help someone who has some visual impairment. A similar ‘assistance’ could help in reinforcing memory especially for those exhibiting early signs of dementia or memory disorders, they added. The researchers said that the data set has a wide variety of scenes, people, and activities. “Initially, we wanted to have a team that could travel across the country and participate in data collection. But with the pandemic, we had to find multiple local teams and ship cameras as well as data. We had to train people over videos,” said CV Jawahar of Centre for Visual Information Technology, IIITH. He said that at each location, participants were selected from various walks of lives, including home cooks, carpenters, painters, electricians, farmers, among others. “It was not a scripted activity carried out by graduate students. Video footage was taken as each individual went about his or her daily tasks in a normal setting,” Jawahar added. “Even while conducting surgeries, it can guide and provide additional cues to the surgeon wearing the device,” Jawahar said, on the prospects of the first-person vision technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-data-collection-to-aid-ego4d-project/articleshow/87120032.cms||---

The chief minister chaired a review meeting on Covid-19 on Monday and asked officials to complete the process of compassionate appointments by November 30. Speaking on this occasion, the chief minister said all the medical facilities in the state should have sufficient staff based on national guidelines. “There should be no compromise on this.

---||Kolkata||Residents shocked at gruesome death of neighbourhood old-timer||Kolkata: Residents of Kankulia Road had heard about a double murder in their area on Sunday night itself but it was the next morning that they realized that the victims were old-timer Subir Chaki (61) and his driver, Rabin Mondal (65). On Monday, the south Kolkata address, adjoining Golpark, Ballygunge and Fern Road, was swamped by media vehicles and policemen. Initially, the neighbours mistook the victim to be “Chaki Sir”, who also lived in the area, but soon realized it was a member of the “other Chaki house, located nearby”. Most residents said they knew Chaki’s mother but never had any interaction with her son, Subir. Anamika Nath, a senior citizen who has lived there for over 60 years, said, “I thought it was Chaki Sir’s house. But the murder happened is another house and we are not sure if they are relatives. It’s an old house, I know the place but I did not know the victim. It’s scary to think my sister-in-law’s son has a house right next door.” For Amiya Kumar Bose, it was a feeling of a different sort. “This is one place that still has a number of old houses. But most of them are being sold off to realtors who are turning them into high-rises. A lot of constructions have been going on and more and more people from outside are coming in. It is hard to find old-timers here now. We are shaken that someone who spent his childhood here died so violently,” he said. Almost everyone was familiar with the two-storey house. “I knew of Subir Chaki’s name though I have never seen him. His mother lived in that house and he had shifted her to New Town,” said Soumendra Kumar Bagchi, a homoeopath. “We are shocked that such a gruesome murder happened only a few buildings away and we got to know nothing about it.” Shocked and feeling disconnected, septuagenarian Gargi Roy said, “It is not about CCTV cameras. That is for the police to look after. But why should someone who grew up here not even knock on his neighbour’s door to say he was here? I have seen the Mercedes that I now see on TV being parked here earlier. But we had no inkling of what was going on inside that house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/residents-shocked-at-gruesome-death-of-neighbourhood-old-timer/articleshow/87120405.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||‘He was the go-to man in any crisis, a guiding star’||Kolkata: From organizing vaccination drives at his housing society in New Town to helping out friends and colleagues in trouble, Subir Chaki was always the go-to man in any crisis and was just a call away for one and all. None of his colleagues, neighbours, friends and acquaintances could believe that “such a large-hearted person, like Chaki” could meet such a violent death. “Chakida was an inspiration, a guiding star. He had great knowledge in almost every field. . Ours was the first housing society in New Town to begin a vaccination drive, thanks to Chakida. He made a few phone calls and the drive was rolled out in the next couple of days,” said a senior member of residents’ association at Uniworld City in New Town. Born in a family of teachers, Chaki topped joint entrance exams and studied mechanical engineering from IIT Kharagpur. He ranked 19th at the Institute of Cost and Work Accountants of India before he completed his PG certificate in general management from IIM Calcutta in 1987. “He was a brilliant scholar, probably the best in our family,” said Mainak Chaki, his cousin. The current MD of Kilburn Engineering Limited, a Bombay stock exchange listed company, for more than four years, Chaki had been associated with the Williamson Magor group for over two decades, serving as the whole-time director of McNally Sayaji Engineering Ltd and president (manufacturing) of Eveready Industries India Ltd. He had been posted in Mumbai since 2017 but had been working from Kolkata after the pandemic. “Chaki was close to Deepak Khaitan, former chairman of the group, who had brought him in and mentored him. Chaki had lived up to Khaitan’s expectations and rose the ladder of success. He handled the operations ably even after Khaitan’s death,” said a colleague. None from the coroporate world could remember anyone of Chaki’s stature—a top official of a BSE-listed company—to be murdered while in service. Back in 1999, then Exide chief Satyabrata Ganguly was abducted from Ballygunge and Khadim’s MD and chairman Partha Pratim Roy Burman was kidnapped from Tiljala in 2001. But both were released and no harm came to them. “We are shocked. We condole his death and urge cops to arrest his murderers at the earliest,” said a senior member of CII, where Chaki was the chairman of the West Bengal Council in 2014-15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/he-was-the-go-to-man-in-any-crisis-a-guiding-star/articleshow/87120373.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Madurai||Madras HC upholds Rs 2.80 lakh relief for load man in workplace accident||MADURAI: Madras high court has confirmed the compensation awarded to a man who sustained injuries in a workplace accident while unloading marble stones from a vehicle in Trichy in 2010. Lattu, 55, was working as a load man in a vehicle owned by Ganesan. In July 2010, when he was unloading marble stones for construction work, the driver suddenly moved the vehicle due to which the stones fell on him and he sustained injuries. After undergoing treatment at a hospital, he filed a petition before commissioner for workmen compensation (deputy commissioner of labour) at Trichy seeking compensation. The commissioner in 2012 awarded him a compensation of Rs 2.80 lakh, which however was challenged by the insurance company through the present civil miscellaneous appeal before HC Madurai bench. The company submitted that the liability should not be fixed on it but the vehicle owner as there was no employer and employee relationship between Lattu and Ganesan. In the absence of such a relationship, the claim under Workmen Compensation Act is not maintainable. Justice R Tharani observed that the FIR shows that the injured was working as a loadman at the time of accident. Ganesan in his evidence had deposed that his vehicle was insured and the policy covers driver, cleaner and six load men. He had also admitted that the vehicle driver admitted his guilt before the court and paid fine. The judge observed that the finding of the commissioner for workmen compensation was based on evidence available on record and it is not perverse. Hence, the judge dismissed the appeal preferred by the insurance company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-rs-2-80-lakh-relief-for-load-man-in-workplace-accident/articleshow/87120392.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra minister rules out change in Covishield doses’ gap||PUNE: Union minister of state for health and family welfare Bharati Pawar on Monday dismissed the possibility of reducing the gap between two doses of Covishield vaccine, citing scientific studies. “There is scientific evidence behind the existing gaps stipulated between the Covid vaccine doses in India, and we have to stick to them. We need to respect these studies rather than issuing political comments,” she said, after taking stock of the Covid situation in Pune. The Maharashtra government is planning to allow citizens vaccinated with the first dose to participate in activities in the opened-up sectors post-Diwali primarily because of the long gap between two shots of Covishield. Drawing attention to state-specific issues pertaining to containment of Covid across the country, Bharati Pawar said, “In northern states, Covid cases have registered sharp decline but some of the states like Kerala and Maharashtra are still reporting comparatively more cases than others. Hence, the Union government has not issued blanket guidelines and has asked states to take state-specific measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minister-rules-out-change-in-covishield-doses-gap/articleshow/87120400.cms||---

Muthu, then aged 50, was into construction work, earning Rs 4,500 a month. Following the incident, he was admitted to a hospital and his left leg had to be amputated from the knee. The Tirunelveli motor accidents claims tribunal, before which he sought compensation, directed the transport corporation to pay a compensation of Rs 2.80lakh to him in 2009. Following the demise of Muthu, his family members (appellants) filed a civil miscellaneous appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2014, challenging the tribunal award and seeking its enhancement. They contended that the tribunal ought to have granted Rs 1lakh towards pain and sufferings and Rs 1lakh towards loss of amenities. However, the transport corporation submitted that the driver did not move the bus in a negligent manner and the accident occurred as Muthu attempted to board the moving bus. Awarding compensation towards temporary loss of income for the period of treatment and for the period of rehabilitation,Justice R Tharani partially allowed the appeal and enhanced the compensation from Rs 2.80lakh to Rs 3lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-increases-accident-relief-for-victims-kin/articleshow/87120369.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Crop cut to prepare ground forPM’s rally, alleges Cong leader||Varanasi: Former minister and senior Congress leader Ajay Rai on Monday alleged that “the state government has spoiled standing crop in the fields to prepare ground for the proposed rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi along ring-road near Mehdiganj”. However, the district administration made it clear that eight hectares of land of around 108 farmers had been taken after their consent. They were paid compensation for their crop as per the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. As the process to cut crop from the fields selected for PM’s rally proposed on October 25 in Mehdiganj area where he will inaugurate the ring-road- phase-2 package-1 and 31 other projects of over Rs 5,200 crores began, Rai held a press conference on Monday and termed it as “immoral”. ”The crop in the fields was going to become ready for harvesting in a week or two. But, the hard work of farmers was removed just to make a grand show by BJP,” alleged Rai. He claimed that the huge turnout in the recent rally of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi had upset BJP in the PM’s constituency due to which it was leaving no stone unturned to hold a mega show of strength. Rai said, “Instead of spoiling the crop and paying compensation to the farmers from the government exchequer, some other ground should have been selected.” However, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma held Rai’s claims and allegations “a bid to mislead the people”. He said, “The ring-road is an ambitious project for which amount paid to the farmers for their land was much more than the cost of road construction. The ring-road has also improved the cost of farmers’ land and the latter will be benefited by this project as transportation of their produce will become easy after its opening.” “To signify this importance of the project, the site for its dedication to the nation by the PM was selected along the ring road,” he added. “The farmers have given consent to provide their fields for the PM’s rally,” said the DM adding, “The cost of their yield was assessed as per prescribed norms and compensation was paid according to the MSP fixed by the government. Moreover, crops in many fields were ready for harvesting. They were harvested and also delivered at the doorsteps of the farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/crop-cut-to-prepare-ground-forpms-rally-alleges-cong-leader/articleshow/87118250.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BEST electric buses to be charged with solar power||MUMBAI: Electric bus rides will now be on 100% green energy as BEST officials have switched from coal-based thermal to solar energy to charge its fleet of 386 buses. Officials said that normally BEST procures electricity for its consumers from Tata Power, which comes from its coal-based thermal plants. But now, BEST is procuring solar power from the grid — with some of it generated by its own consumers who have opted for photovoltaic solar panels — for its fleet. There is a 40% subsidy for solar rooftop installations in buildings and BEST is catering to 580KWp (Kilowatts peak) of solar power capacity in the island city with financial assistance from the Centre. The solar energy generated by its consumers is transferred to the grid in lieu of which they get benefits in monthly electricity bills. “We have decided to use only solar and in future, solar-wind or hydro-based energy to power our e-buses,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra. He said that the undertaking will procure adequate solar energy by June 2023 to cater to over 2,100 electric buses, and by 2027, the undertaking plans 100% electrification of its fleet. Sources in the energy department said that solar power could be procured/purchased at cheaper rates as compared to thermal power and there was a push for generating more renewables in the state in the next five years. According to an estimate, the state plans to generate a total 17,360MW of solar energy in five years. The BEST has decided to procure only electric AC buses in future with 2,100 e-buses planned by 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/best-electric-buses-to-be-charged-with-solar-power/articleshow/87123844.cms||Somit Sen

Tarun had just opened his second outlet in 2012. For him, it was simply the love of what he knew the best after a hotel management diploma. But for Varun to give up a job like he had and join his brother may look a bit crazy. “What drives me is adding value. I used to do that in my past jobs and am doing the same here. Whether it’s a job or entrepreneurship, what matters is how we are going to add value. We have to have that feeling of being business owners, like Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella and many others,” says Varun. In fact, from two to 12 outlets today, Varun is already on a value creation path. Now, he prepares for a journey even more absorbing. “We want to hit the 100-mark very soon. Currently, we are in talks with a few venture capital and private equity investors,” says Varun. Though the company is keen on opening its own outlets, Varun says they are not blind to a franchisee route. “Our desired state is to have company-owned outlets, but as we seek a larger footprint, we will not rule out some franchisee additions. That will bring in the enhanced visibility we want. But we will be very selective as we don’t want dilution to the quality and consistency we offer.” Social media has enlarged aspirations, even in tier-II and III cities and towns. But options are in short supply or non-existent. Varun says, they will take their three-format model, of purely takeaways, home delivery and mini dine-in set ups, and the regular dine-in restaurants to these unserved locations. “The Covid pandemic gave us the breathing space to pause and draw our growth trajectory. We are at an advanced stage of raising funds to go really hard. We have created a brand value and now is the time to build on it,” adds Varun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/varun-tarun-behl-kebabs-curries-company/articleshow/87122689.cms||---

However, officials say efforts are on to cover more people through door-to-door vaccination in some areas. Of the 25.61 lakh adults in Madurai district, 18.49lakh have received the vaccine as on Sunday, the coverage being close to 70% for first dose. While up to a lakh or more were covered through the mega drives in a day, for the past week, the district saw only around 3,000 people getting the jab a day. Health officials said this is only a temporary dip thanks to holidays and rain. “The big challenge for us now is that the number of those who are voluntarily coming in to get vaccinated is declining. Even now, many fear about side effects. The change in mindset needs to be at grassroots level,” said a health official. While at least two corporation wards have achieved 100% Covid-19 vaccination, health officials said that some hamlets and panchayats in rural areas are also close to achieving it. “We are trying our best to allay fears and convince people to take the jab. There are also some who don’t want to take the jab immediately for reasons like their work. It is a lot of pressure on healthcare workers too and we wish the public understand it is only for their welfare,” said a village health nurse. Health officials have collected details of all those who are above 18 years and are implementing door-to-door vaccination in some areas to cover more people. “Door-to-door vaccination drive improves coverage but the issue is that the number of healthcare workers and nurses is less and it is impossible to cover such a large population. We need involvement of other department officials as in the mega vaccination drive to do more,” said another health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/slowdown-in-drive-temporary-officials/articleshow/87120438.cms||---

Elections to these civic bodies were not held along with other municipalities in April due to pending court cases. After getting clearances from the courts, the SEC has directed the district collectors of Nellore, Guntur, West Godavari, Krishna, Chittoor, Kurnool, Kadapa and Anantapur to release draft notifications of the polling centres. The SEC has also directed collectors to appoint returning officers to all wards in the respective civic bodies immediately. Sources said the SEC plans to conduct elections in the remaining municipal towns and cities in the last week of October. The SEC will also conduct by-elections in 20 municipal divisions and wards, which fell vacant following the death of elected members. Elections to Kuppam municipality, the home town of TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu, will also be held along with other towns in the last week. Elections in Kuppam and Nellore city are expected to be a matter of prestige for YSRC and TDP. Although YSRC won over 98% of the municipalities that went for polls in April, TDP is leaving no stone unturned to regain its lost ground in the coming elections. YSRC won almost all village panchayats and MPPs in Kuppam assembly constituency with a resounding majority and is looking to further expand its grip over the constituency by winning Kuppam municipality. Chandrababu Naidu has decided to prove his strength by winning the municipal town. TDP had conceded a majority of over 60,000 votes to YSRC in the panchayat and MPTC elections. Naidu, who won the assembly election with a majority of over 30,000, is determined to energise party cadre by visiting the constituency next week. Meanwhile, winning Nellore Municipal Corporation (NMC) has become a big test for city legislator and irrigation minister Dr P Anil Kumar Yadav. Both Anil Yadav and Nellore Rural assembly constituency legislator Sridhar Reddy are working overtime to ensure the party’s victory in the municipal elections. Interestingly, TDP is also confident of tasting success in Nellore city, thanks to the presence of strong local leaders.

The move follows the Centre’s direction to submit data of all districts and states that have completed 100% vaccination for block and villages with first dose of Covid vaccine. Health officials said nearly 200 villages in Pune district, mainly from the Pune Metropolitan Region area, had claimed of covering 100% of their eligible population with the first dose of the vaccine. “While in some villages, the numbers were shown as more than 100%, others claimed to have covered all the beneficiaries. But the electoral roll in these villages showed that they had more eligible people to be covered,” a senior official said. Local authorities have also been directed to conduct a house-to-house survey to check that no beneficiary was left out. A separate list of names not enrolled as voters, but vaccinated is being prepared.

The yatra will begin from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi on October 21. State president Sabhajit Singh said that the yatra will be led by party MP and state in-charge Sanjay Singh. So far, four yatras have been finalised but one will be held in all divisional headquarters within the next month “The yatra will cover a distance of 3-5 km in Varanasi. Through this, party workers will reiterate the promise made by the party to the people of UP in which AAP will provide 300 units of free power to people, waive off all pending bills within 24 hours of getting elected, provide free power to farmers for agricultural purposes and ensure that there is 24 hours of uninterrupted power supply,” Singh said. He said that the party had been running a free bijli guarantee scheme in the state for which a number had been issued so that people could connect with the party. AAP workers were also going house to house and holding camps where they were telling people about the various promises made by the party. “In the coming days, we will hold similar programmes on our promise of employment and also on education, for which we have promised to set aside 25% of the state’s budget,” Singh said. After Varanasi, the next yatra will be held in Basti on October 22, followed by one in Gonda on October 24 and one in Ghaziabad on October 28.

---||Madurai||Carcass of baby elephant washed ashore in Kodayar||Kanyakumari: The carcass of a seven-month-old elephant calf washed ashore at Kothai Mudangu in the Kodayar River about 8km downstream Kodayar dam in Kanyakumari district on Monday. “Examination of the lungs during autopsy revealed that the animal died of drowning as a result of difficulty in breathing,” district forest officer (DFO) M Ilayaraja told TOI. The animal, said to be part of a resident herd of 14 to 20 elephants at Kodayar, could have slipped into the water, or could have been washed away into the dam area in flash floods. The DFO said that the animal could have died about 48 hours before it was spotted at Kothai Mudangu around 11 am on Monday. The carcass was first spotted by Tangedco officials at Kodayar dam around 2 pm on Saturday. However, they were not clear whether it was an elephant due to the heavy downpour. Forest department personnel rushed to the spot in an hour, but could not spot the carcass as the shutters of the dam had to be opened due to the heavy inflow of water from the catchment areas. “Two teams searched for the animal downstream on Sunday but it could not be spotted,” Ilayaraja said. After spotting it on Monday morning, a vet from the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve reached the spot and performed the autopsy in the presence of the DFO, assistant conservator of forest Manasir Haleema and Shivakumar and Kulasekaram range officer Vijayakumar in the afternoon. Though there were no external or suspicious injuries on the carcass, samples of vital organs were collected to be sent to the Advanced Institute for Wildlife Conservation, Chennai, for forensic analysis. A detailed post-mortem report is expected in a week, the forest official said. The carcass was buried in a pit near the forest check post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/carcass-of-baby-elephant-washed-ashore-in-kodayar/articleshow/87120419.cms||---

Pointing out that poor quality of potable water including through public water connections forces residents to spend on bubble top water cans and RO purifier units, consumer outfits urged the local body to overhaul the drinking water network.Residents of KK Nagar, Kajamalai and Trichy airport opined that the corporation water often appears discoloured. Sporadic complaints have also come from E Pudur and Woraiyur. Avoiding corporation water for consumption means residents have to spend a significant amount on RO purified water or bubble top water can. Most residences in Ponmalai zone utilise corporation water for non-drinking purposes. Concerned over the test report indicating presence of coliform bacteria in drinking water samples, Consumer protection council, Tamil Nadu asked the civic body to examine the entire water supply network in a similar way. “Residents need clean and risk-free drinking water. The civic body must publish weekly water quality report to keep people informed and thus maintaining accountability,” S Pushpavanam, secretary of the council, said. In some wards including Rockfort, public drinking water tap and pipes are situated within a few centimetres of sewage carriers with possibilities of contamination during heavy rain. “We have been chlorinating drinking water both at the headworks and in overhead tanks. Once a month, the health department is conducting quality tests. As for making the water test reports public, there has to be a discussion ” a senior official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/report-water-quality-every-week-trichy-residents-tell-corporation/articleshow/87120514.cms||Deepak Karthik

This year, the council has also changed the examination pattern for the ISC and ICSE board exams by having two term exams instead of an annual board exam and also having 100% multiple choice questions (MCQs). “The exam is going to be only with MCQs and we are also preparing the students for that. The new pattern is aimed at making students prepare to face competitive exams but at the same time, it can be challenging for students to score high,” said K R Udhayam, secretary, VMJ School. He said that for the first term exams to be held in November there is some confusion on whether students will be taking the online exam from their homes or from schools as it has been left to the preference of students. “The council is asking students to take the exam from their homes if they have electronic devices available and schools will have to make arrangements if not. One proctor will be monitoring every 25 students online and the students have to sit the exam, while being on video the whole time. However, we don’t know what to do if there is any network issue. We are still awaiting the detailed protocol to be followed,” said Shanthi Mohan, principal, Lakshmi School. She also added that a training programme is also soon to be held for proctors too. Schools are meanwhile looking to make students be prepared and comfortable to take the exams, by holding mock tests. Teachers noted that there is no place for rote learning now and students have to properly understand concepts to score well. “This is the first time an exam is happening mid-year for the students and the syllabus is also divided into half for each term. The new pattern and system aim at preparing students for competitive exams which can be taken as positive,” said Navaneetha Krishnan, principal, Vikaasa School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/icse-schools-prepare-for-term-exam-in-nov/articleshow/87120510.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Heavy rains and crop damage have resulted in a shortfall in supply across the state, even as demand for vegetables has increased with the festival and wedding seasons. Estimates with the Rajiv Gandhi Wholesale Market in Vijayawada show that demand for tomatoes has risen from 160 metric tonnes per day to 230 metric tonnes per day over the last ten days. The input of tomatoes from Madanapalle market, however, has reduced to 80 metric tonnes a day, which has led to a massive gap between demand and supply. As a result, the price of fine quality tomatoes has shot up to Rs 75 per kg in retail markets. “The tomato crop has been damaged after the sudden rains in September this year. We are facing a severe shortage of stocks. We are presently looking to import stocks from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu at Rs 55 per kilogram. We estimate that the cost of tomatoes will further hit Rs 100 per kilogram in the next ten days,” said M Raghunath Reddy, a trader from Kaleswara Rao market in the city. In a similar trend, the price of onions crossed the Rs 60 per kilogram mark at wholesale markets on Monday. Traders say they will import freshly harvested stocks from the Kurnool region to meet demand. Vegetables such as okra, carrot and beetroot are selling at Rs 45 per kilogram. Consumers said they have cut down on their vegetable purchases to minimise the impact of soaring prices. “High vegetable prices will have an adverse impact on the lives of the common man. We are unable to meet the expenses with the rise in prices. We have removed tomatoes and onions from our shopping list,” said K Anjani, a homemaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/onion-tomato-go-out-of-poor-mans-menu/articleshow/87118321.cms||Venu Lanka

Yogendra and Raja Rishidev of Araria district were gunned down by militants at their rented accommodation in Wanpoh area of Kulgam in Jammu & Kashmir on Sunday evening. One Chunchun Rishidev suffered serious bullet injuries in the terrorist attack. Pramila, a mother of three, had not interacted with her husband for long. “He was willing to return home but had no money. The labour contractor, who had taken him along with others to J&K, had not paid him wages,” she lamented. Now Pramila is waiting for her husband's body. “I don’t know who killed my husband and why? He was the only breadwinner in the family. His death has pushed the family, already in debt, to the brink of starvation,” she added. Yogendra, a resident of Kheruganj village under Araria block, had gone to J&K about four months ago. He worked there as a labourer in a real estate company. His wife has been living with her parents ever since Yogendra left for J&K. Pramila received the news about her husband’s death around Sunday midnight. “I left for her ‘sasural’ early Monday morning,” Pramila’s father told this newspaper over phone. Similarly, the relatives of Raja Rishidev, a native of Basaithi village under Raniganj block, are yet to believe that he was no more. In fact, Raja had talked to his mother barely two hours before the shocking incident. “It is hard to believe that Raja is no more. He had promised to make a call late in the night as he was busy with work that time. But that moment never came. We received the news about his death from a co-resident,” said his father Tilu Rishidev, adding that they wanted his body back to perform the last rites. The family members of Chunchun were in touch with some co-residents staying in Kashmir to know about his health. Chunchun is a resident of Mirzapur ward number 10 under Bounsi panchayat in Raniganj block of Araria district. Meanwhile, the body of Arvind Kumar Sah, who was killed in J&K on October 15, was cremated at Mandar Paparni ghat in Banka district on Monday. His younger brother Mukesh Sah lit the pyre. Earlier, the body was brought to Arvind’s native village Lakhpura Parghari under Barahat block by an ambulance arranged by the Banka district administration from the Patna airport on Sunday.

---||Hubballi||Sustainable, decentralised energy plays a major role in revitalising agri: Hande||Dharwad: Agriculture, the backbone of Indian economy, needs revitalisation, and decentralised, sustainable energy will play a major role in achieving this, said Harish Hande, Magsaysay awardee and founder-chairman of SELCO.Delivering the 34th annual convocation address at the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS, Dharwad) on Monday, he said climate change and its implications are felt by small and marginal farmers. With increasing unpredictability of rainfall and depleting groundwater levels, they face greater adaptation challenges. More than 69% of India is dry and facing severe risk of droughts. Nearly 85% of rural women are engaged in labour-intensive processes like sowing and harvesting, with limited access to technology, finance, skills and policy-making, said Hande.Technology innovations have to happen to make small-holding farming attractive and remunerative, especially for women engaged in it and financial products need to be in sync with the needs of women and other marginal farmers, Hande said, and hinted the fresh graduates and post-graduates that these are solvable challenges.Hande explained that decentralised sustainable energy can address many of these needs. “There is wonderful link between development and sustainable energy. Sustainable energy interventions like solar power can democratise the delivery of health, education and livelihood applications. The beauty of solar power is that it is also modular in nature. It need not be transported across hundreds of kilometres with transmission losses, challenges of reliability and extreme weather events. Being modular and decentralised, the poor can generate their own power as per their immediate and long-term requirements,” Hande explained.He called upon farm graduates to develop replicable models and processes which can help create a more inclusive world. UAS vice-chancellor prof Mahadev Chetti welcomed the gathering and explained the achievements of the university.Governor and chancellor Thavarchand Gehlot conferred the degrees on eligible candidates and presented gold medals and prizes to the winners. Agriculture minister B C Patil was present.As many as 911 candidates were conferred graduate and PG degrees in various disciplines, while 63 candidates were conferred PhD degrees at the convocation. Twenty-five candidates shared 53 gold medals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/sustainable-decentralised-energy-plays-a-major-role-in-revitalising-agri-hande/articleshow/87115878.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Time for Nishads to ask for rights: VIP||Lucknow: Part of the government in Bihar, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) is hoping to get political mileage over other Nishad-centric political outfits set to test political waters in UP. VIP has chosen its position in the neighbouring state as a plank to ride on and convince voters in Nishad Chetna rallies, a series of rallies which the party has decided to hold till October 31 in 13 districts of the state. “Why should not the voters in UP be told about the party’s success in Bihar? Though we have only four MLAs, we have a say in the government. We are present in the cabinet meeting with the CM and that makes a difference,” said national spokesperson of the party Dev Jyoti. In Uttar Pradesh, the party’s first Nishad Chetna rally was held in Agra on October 13. After a break it resumed on Sunday in Ambedkarnagar and Azamgarh. Monday’s rally was held in Prayagraj. The founder and national president of the party Mukesh Sahni, also a minister in Bihar government, is reaching rally grounds on his chopper to address the crowd. “Koi Ram ko manta hai, koi Rahim ko, hum Phoolan Devi ji ko maante hain. She is our ideal (Some worship Ram, some Rahim. We idolise Phoolan Devi),” said Sahni, adding that it’s high time Nishads in UP asked for their rights. The party has already announced it will have no alliance in the state till its demand for reservation for various castes of Nishads is answered by the state government. It plans to contest on at least 169 seats that have a dominant Nishad presence.

Sardesai said that due to the government’s inaction, not only have local fishermen been deprived of their livelihood, but also the people of Goa of good quality fish. If illegal fishing is allowed, it will lead to fish famine in Goa, he said. A fisherman from Benaulim, he said, intervened to stop bull trawling, while the administration did not act. Fisheries minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues denied the charge that his ministry did not act against illegal fishing. “We have never favoured illegal fishing. My department recently seized two boats. We will not permit illegal fishing,” the fisheries minister said. Bull trawling is not new to Goa and whenever such cases have been brought to their notice in the past, his ministry has acted promptly, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-hit-by-outstation-trawlers/articleshow/87120476.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Mutual fund assets under management grew by Rs 55,000 crore in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Riding on fresh inflows to equity-linked mutual funds and increasing net asset value, overall assets under management (AUM) for mutual funds (MFs) in Gujarat increased by Rs 55,201 crore in just eleven months. With this, total AUM for MFs in Gujarat breached the Rs 2.5 lakh crore-mark to touch Rs 2.57 lakh crore in September 2021, according to data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).  In Gujarat, overall AUM breached the Rs 2 lakh crore mark in November 2020. Since then, AUM for equity MFs alone increased by Rs 44,440.65 crore, driven by sustained SIP inflows, and fresh inflows by investors drawn lured by attractive returns. “This is perhaps the fastest pace at which AUM for mutual funds has grown in Gujarat and it is largely due to equity MFs. While the net asset value of investments went up significantly, fresh inflows continued due to high returns from the equity markets,” said Mumukshu Desai, director of a city-based financial advisory firm. According to AMFI, AUM for equity MFs stood at Rs 1.31 lakh crore in September. In March this year, AUM for equity MFs had breached the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time in Gujarat. Analysts said private sector expansion plans have halted for the past year and a half due to the pandemic uncertainty. “Investors had surplus funds which were deposited into both equity and debt funds. A number of new fund offers promising lucrative returns also led to fresh investments,” Desai added. Financial consultants attributed the swelling of AUM to fresh inflows from SIPs as well as re-investment of stock gains in mutual funds. “SIP inflows continued and this is clear with the number of new demat accounts opened, especially by youngsters who got into the habit of savings after the economic uncertainty that followed the pandemic and lockdown in 2020. As stocks of several companies have delivered unprecedented returns, seasoned investors booked profits and invested them in equity-mutual funds,” said Jayesh Vithalani, an Ahmedabad-based financial consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mutual-fund-aum-grew-by-rs-55000-cr-in-gujarat/articleshow/87120520.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Lucknow||Check unregulated sale of fertilizers, DMs told||Lucknow: The state government on Monday reinforced strict measures to arrest unregulated sale of fertilizers to farmers in the ongoing Rabi crop season. In a missive sent to all district magistrates, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi said that the authorities need to ensure that fertilizers are sold to farmers through Point of Sale (PoS) machines after due assessment of the cultivable area of individual farmers. The state government had decided to provide fertilizers to farmers after due review of their cultivable land in August earlier this year. The department has also asked the district authorities to stop wholesale stockists from hoarding of fertilizers that could eventually lead to rise in their prices locally. At the same time, the authorities have been asked to keep a strong vigil on retailers and initiate action under essential commodities Act, 1955 against them if they are found selling fertilizers at higher prices. Chaturvedi said that farmers essentially require phosphatic fertilizers, DAP and NPK at the time of sowing Rabi crops. The demand is high for phosphatic fertilizers. He said that the retailers as well as wholesale stockists will be required to keep documentary evidence of distribution and sale of fertilizers. They will also be required to mention the area of cultivation and the description of crop. The outlets of the cooperative societies and private sellers will be monitored by a team of officials from the agriculture, cooperative, rural development and other connected departments. The officials, who will be deputed at the fertilizer outlet, will be required to attest the details of the cultivable area and the amount of fertilizer given to a farmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/check-unregulated-sale-of-fertilizers-dms-told/articleshow/87122792.cms||Pankaj Shah

The corporation had in the last two weeks invited over 70,000 people through a bulk SMS platform of the national informatics centre (NIC). Beneficiaries were selected from among 1.85 lakh people in the district awaiting their second dose including about 1.56 lakh who took Covishield and the remaining Covaxin. The SMS invite encouraged the recipients to approach the nearest urban primary health centre for the second dose. However, when many approached UPHCs, they were surprised to be told that they are ineligible to take the second dose. “After standing in the queue, the health workers while registering our names said we cannot get the second dose as one more week was left to complete the wait period,” Yazhini P, a resident of Thippiran Thotti street said. Many residents returned after arguing in vain. Some UPHCs have been vaccinating residents having the SMS invite to avoid arguments even if they did not cross the waiting period, but a few others including Beerangikulam UPHC have been defiant.“Some of those coming with the SMS are being vaccinated if we have doses left in the opened vial,” an official at a UPHC in Ponmalai zone said. Residents also complained that the importance given for bulk vaccination programme on Sundays is not seen on normal days. UPHCs are returning the vials well before noon while residents were assured in press releases that vaccination will go on till 4 pm. “We are calling eligible beneficiaries of second dose. The data was taken from CoWIN portal. We will examine and rectify mistakes if any,” Dr M Yazhini, city health officer told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/many-get-trichy-corpn-invite-for-dose-ii-but-turned-away/articleshow/87120526.cms||Deepak Karthik

Eight feeders of the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) have been affected and the lines will be repaired once the rain stops. Speaking with TOI, UPCL managing director Deepak Rawat said due to the incessant rain since Sunday, the department workers have not been able to carry out repairs of the feeders.“Our feeders at places like Harshil, Ranikhet and Barkot have been affected and since the rain has not stopped, it is not possible for us to work at night. Once the rain stops, we will try to restore the supply in six to seven hours,” he added. Meanwhile, local sources said power supply to nearly 250 villages in Almora had snapped. While 200 villages of Salt block were without electricity and several other blocks also reported power cuts. The district disaster management office from Bageshwar reported that nearly 80 villages there were in darkness. “Landslides as well as incessant rainfall have caused faults in several supply lines. Our staff is at these spots and efforts are on to restore the lines. Till now, we have been able to restore the supply in one region and work is still on other lines,” said an official of the disaster management department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rainfall-disrupts-power-supply-to-over-230-villages-in-ukhand/articleshow/87118362.cms||Prashant Jha

Sardesai said they rushed to the well of the House demanding Sawant’s resignation. “Between May 10 and 14, around 80 people died during the ‘dark hours’ due to the shortage of oxygen,” he said. “On May 11, health minister Vishwajit Rane had said that the high court should probe the oxygen shortage. Hence, it was clear that there was a shortage of oxygen, but the CM tried to narrate a different story to cover up his failures. Now, this report has exposed the unprofessional and indifferent conduct of the Goa government.” Waving newspapers, including TOI that carried the news of the three-member committee’s report on the GMC oxygen shortage, he said that Sawant was callous and not serious about the health or lives of Goans, and hence, “he should resign immediately taking responsibility for all the deaths which took place due to the shortage of oxygen”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-demands-cms-resignation-over-o2-tragedy/articleshow/87120551.cms||---

Most government schools have so far been focusing on helping students bridge their learning gap and are only properly starting with focusing on completing the syllabus. We are also holding some minor practice tests,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. Teachers are also worried for the current batch of Class XII students who are set to write their board exams in 2022 since they have not written any exams in both Class X and Class XI. “Especially for Class XII, conducting exams is much needed for them to practise writing and attending the three-hour long exams so they could be prepared for board exams. With online classes, students have also not been able to have much writing practice. There is also a lackadaisical attitude among students as of now so holding exams will help them pay more attention to studies,” said S Shanthi, a Class XII Physics teacher. “There is no point in cancelling the exams. At least cancellation of quarterly exams is understandable since some schools have not completed much of the syllabus but a half-yearly exam is necessary. Even if not at district level, each individual school must be given freedom and hold a half-yearly exam for the portion of syllabus they decide on,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). S Rohini, a Class XII student said it has been a struggle to get used to writing exams in classrooms again. “Our school held a few unit tests and even for them, we found it a bit tough. Holding exams will be helpful to prepare for the board exams,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cancelling-exams-not-the-way-forward-say-teachers/articleshow/87120519.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The moment a ride is booked, the driver calls up the rider to ask the destination, and if he is unhappy with the route, he conveniently cancels the ride leaving the commuter in the lurch,” said Shilpa Govale, who had to face three cancellations recently after which she got a ride. Drivers avoid calling up passengers during bookings and simply send a message, “Where are you going?” or “Aapka drop kidhar hai (where is your drop)? “This is unwarranted. I have complained to Uber on Twitter,” said a rider. Uber told him to provide details about the trip and promised to “address the issue”. There are many complaints on social media. Drivers’ union sources said that lately, due to Covid, there is no penalty for cancelling rides. But if there is a series of cancellations by a driver, the aggregator firm gives a “push notification” on the driver app, asking him to refrain from cancellations. If this continues, the driver is blacklisted, aggregator firm sources said. The drivers’ performance depends a lot on passenger rankings. “So, if there are more complaints, it affects the driver’s rankings and the aggregator firm can take action against him, and take him off platform if the complaints are serious,” said a source from an aggregator firm. Commuters demanded that driver partners should be prosecuted by police/RTO for refusals Sudhir Bhosale, union leader from Maharashtra Rajya Rashtriya Kamgar Sangh, justified cancellations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-riders-sore-as-ola-uber-drivers-now-cancel-drives/articleshow/87123858.cms||Somit Sen

More than 200m of the service lane along SG Road lies badly damaged. For the last three weeks, residents of the area have been appealing to the municipal corporation to make repairs before Diwali. “I live near Prahladnagar fire station and take the service road between Raju Puncture Shop and my office which is behind the Ahmedabad rural SP office. The drive after YMCA Club is treacherous. One has to be careful. Each monsoon this stretch suffers heavy damage as rainwater collects on it,” says Pratik Rajyaguru, who runs a home gardening equipment agency. Rajyaguru is not alone. Residents living along many roads in western Ahmedabad have been complaining about cratered roads. not being able to drive on smooth stretches. Take the 3km stretch between Shivranjini Crossroads and Prahladnagar Crossroads, where nearly 17% of the road or 800m is of average or poor quality. The situation on the 1.9km stretch between Venus Atlantis and Ahmedabad rural police headquarters in Makarba, where nearly 400m road is graded average or poor. The quality of these roads have been determined by a mobile app ‘Road Bounce’, which detects vibrations and calculates the roughness index of a road depending whether they are concrete or asphalt. A concrete road must have fewer than 2,200 vertical elevations, that is, small or large bumps, on a 100m section to be classified as ‘excellent’ on the roughness index. An asphalt road must fewer than 2,000. Similarly, an asphalt road is classified ‘average’ if it has between 2,000 and 3,000 vertical rises over 100m. The road is classified ‘bad’ if this number passes 3,000 bumps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sw-zone-roads-like-off-road-trails/articleshow/87120560.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Goa||Rise in serious crime will dent Goa’s tourism industry, opposition warns govt||PORVORIM: Warning the government that the recent spate of murders and the rise in crime will dent Goa’s image as a safe tourist destination, the opposition on Monday demanded that Goa police be given a free hand to investigate and crackdown on criminal activity. The opposition also said that political interference has stymied investigations in critical cases, which further emboldens anti-social elements. The opposition also said that locals have lost confidence in the government and no longer feel safe in their own homes. Coming out in defence of Goa police and replying to the opposition’s charge that crimes are on the rise, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that Goa tops the list in the country for successful crime detection and resolution. Sawant’s claims did little to blunt the opposition’s attack which came just days after four murders rocked the tiny state. “Increasing crime, including serious ones like murder and rape, in the state indicates total collapse of law and order which has damaged the image of Goa. This will affect tourism and other sectors, further dragging down the economy,” said Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, while speaking on the calling attention about the rise in crimes in Goa. Sardesai blamed political interference for the deteriorating law and order situation while deputy speaker and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes said that quick arrests and fast convictions can act as deterrents. “Conviction should take place within a short time. Accountability should rest on the officer,” Fernandes said. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte also alleged that BJP MLAs and ministers are interfering in investigations and using Goa police to harass the opposition. “In the last 10 years the trend has been to pick cases selectively and selectively target people. The chief minister has to take responsibility. If the chief minister is clear of this then he should incentivise the police or fix responsibility on the police and he should stop political interference,” Khaunte said. Sawant said that no politician is interfering in the functioning of Goa police. Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, in whose constituency two elderly women were murdered, said that the government needs to instil confidence among the people and also inspire confidence among tourists who visit Goa. Former chief minister and Congress MLA Pratapsingh Rane described the present law and order situation in Goa as the Wild West where arms and ammunition seem to be freely available to shoot people. “The government has to put in strict measures. There are methods that police use to get such criminal elements. We have to punish them for this illegal activity otherwise no tourists will come to Goa,” Rane said. Referring to Siddhi Naik’s death, Sardesai said that the government should tell Goa whether it is a murder or death by drowning and why her viscera was not preserved. “The police should be held responsible for this mistake,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rise-in-serious-crime-will-dent-goas-tourism-industry-oppn-warns-govt/articleshow/87120609.cms||---

They appreciated the state government for launching distribution of Rs 1,597.18 crore towards compensation to farmers who insured their crops for the loss incurred for samba (rabi) season during 2020-21. Chief minister M K Stalin launched the distribution of compensation to 6 lakh farmers under the crop insurance scheme on Monday. As a token gesture, he gave away the certificates of compensation to 10 farmers in the Secretariat. “A majority of farmers insure their crops only through primary agriculture credit cooperative societies (PACCS). When compensation is disbursed through PACCS, farmers find it hard to get their share on time. Sometimes, they get a partial amount due to untold reasons. The government should ask district administrations to furnish complete details of farmers and crop insurances,” said Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-seek-transparency-in-distribution-of-crop-insurance/articleshow/87120593.cms||---

He said 160 companies of PAC and nine companies of paramilitary forces were deployed to ensure law and order at and around railway stations in the state. “We had made adequate arrangements one week before the call of the protest was made by the farmers. 20 IPS officers were made nodal heads of sensitive districts to hold talks with farmers and dissuade them from joining the agitation,” said Kumar. Police remained deployed on all important platforms along with a fire brigade for any eventuality. In Sultanpur, about 100 farmers were reportedly detained while they were going to Kheri for the protest. In Lucknow and Barabanki, some local leaders who protested were detained. Farmers’ protest was also reported at Raja-Ki-Mandi railway station in Agra but cops stationed there took a memorandum and dispersed the protestors. Minor protests were also reported from Mathura, Aligarh and Modinagar in Ghaziabad. However, road traffic suffered due to heavy jams on the Yamuna Expressway as farmers blocked the Chilla border (New Delhi-Noida border) for several hours. The call for protest was given by Samyukt Kisan Morcha to demand the dismissal and arrest of Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra Teni, over Lakhimpur Kheri violence where a jeep belonging to Teni’s son mowed down four farmers. In retaliation, farmers had allegedly lynched four people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/farmers-rail-roko-protest-remains-off-the-track-in-up/articleshow/87122847.cms||---

The documents and cellphones found in the car helped us establish contact with the victims’ families and identify them. The six injured persons were given first aid on the spot. They are all residents of Mumbai,” Kadam told TOI. Mordani was employed with a private company in Mumbai, while Siddiqui was looking after a family business. “The two were good friends and were returning from Pune where they had gone for some personal work,” said Kadam. Police said Khan, who was driving his poultry truck at a break-neck speed, lost control of the vehicle and hit a vegetable-laden tempo and then a car. The poultry truck then veered off to the middle lane and collided with a slow-moving luxury bus. At this moment, the car in which Siddiqui and Mordani were travelling crashed into the poultry truck from the rear and a trailer truck trailing the duo’s vehicle rammed it. The car was sandwiched between the two trucks. Khan died due to the impact of the crash after hitting the luxury bus. Vehicular movement on the Mumbai corridor of the expressway remained affected for one-and-a-half hours. Heavy-duty cranes were summoned at the spot to move the wreckage of vehicles to the shoulder lane. Traffic resumed on the Mumbai corridor around 7am. Police later registered a case against the deceased truck driver for rash and negligent driving. Rash driving on the expressway has always been a concern. “I have installed speed governors on all my vehicles. Many times, drivers fail to control the vehicles due to the high speed,” said Avinash Chavan. a Kothrud-based tour operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-from-mumbai-die-6-hurt-as-speeding-truck-causes-6-vehicle-eway-pile-up/articleshow/87125730.cms||---

Raja Rishidev and Yogendra Rishidev from Araria were killed on Sunday and Arvind Kumar Sah from Banka on Saturday. Bunty Kumar, a resident of Ramnagri in Patna, said people are free to work or stay in any part of the country. “We need to think above politics and religion. The demand for cancellation of a T-20 match between India and Pakistan will not solve the problem,” he said. Former principal of Patna College, Nawal Kishore Choudhary, said such killings will also lead to reverse migration. “No one will risk his life and the state should try to provide employment opportunities here,” he said. The killings of Bihar natives in Kashmir also led to political slugfest with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav alleging that people were forced to migrate to other states for employment. He even criticized CM Nitish Kumar’s decision to give Rs2 lakh as compensation to the victim families when the state government was paying Rs4 lakh to the family of those killed in lightning or Rs5 lakh after death due to snake bite. Tejashwi demanded Rs1 crore compensation and job to a member of each victim’s family. “This is a slap on the face of the NDA government, which claimed that terrorism has been curtailed after repealing Article 370,” said Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre. BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday said the terrorists were agitated because of prevailing peace and employment opportunities created in J&K after abolition of Article 370. He accused the opposition of demoralising the Army by making below the standard statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/killings-may-lead-to-reverse-migration/articleshow/87120675.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The cops then allowed the burglars to keep Rs 4,000 and escorted their motorcycle out of the district to safety.  SSP Firozabad Ashok Kumar ordered the arrest of the four policemen immediately after they were identified. Following court orders, the two thieves, along with the policemen, have been sent to jail. On October 15, grocery dealer Gaurav Kumar had filed a complaint at the Rasulpura police station alleging theft of Rs 1 lakh by unknown persons from his auto-rickshaw. Soon after the theft was reported to police, the Firozabad SSP ordered that all vehicles on the road in the district be checked so that the culprits can't escape to neighbouring districts. While scanning footage from CCTV cameras installed in the area, police saw the two thieves stealing money stored under the seat of the delivery vehicle. On Sunday, police arrested the two thieves, identified as Priyanshu and Om Singh, from their residences in Mainpuri district. During interrogation, the two thieves admitted that on October 15 they were stopped by four policemen posted in Sirsaganj police station as they were on their way home to Mainpuri after committing the crime. The thieves said the cops kept Rs 96,000 and then escorted them to the district border safely so that they were not stopped by other policemen on patrolling duty as an alert had been sounded regarding the theft through wireless communication. The four policemen were identified as sub-inspector Sunil Chand, constables Rakesh Kumar and Surendra Singh, and driver Balkrishna. SSP Ashok Kumar said, “Rs 96,000 snatched by the policemen from the two thieves have been recovered. They were arrested after an FIR was registered against them under the relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. They have been suspended and sent to jail along with the two thieves.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/4-cops-jailed-after-they-stop-thieves-with-rs-1-lakh-keep-rs-96k-give-burglars-rs-4k/articleshow/87118470.cms||Deepak Lavania

The former UP CM said the murder of a lawyer inside a court in Shahjahanpur has exposed the ‘encounter’ government’s tall claims of zero tolerance towards crime and criminals. “Under the BJP government, UP has made it to the number one position in ease of committing crime,” Akhilesh said. शाहजहाँपुर में कोर्ट में ही एक वकील की सरेआम हत्या ने ‘एनकाउंटर सरकार’ के झूठे प्रचार का सच जनता के सामने लाकर रख… https://t.co/Gjymdt76jK— Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) 1634547956000The SP also attacked the government over Rs 25 lakh in cash ‘stolen’ from a police station in Agra. Miscreants broke open locks of the ‘maalkhana’ (strong room) and decamped with cash kept at the police station. The cash was recovered from burglars who had raided the residence of a top railway contractor in Agra some time back. “If the police station is not secure, one can imagine the state of affairs elsewhere,” the SP said in a statement on Monday. Akhilesh attacked the government for its growing insensitivity towards victims of crime. He cited an instance in which a woman went to a police station seeking help to trace her husband missing for over 10 days. “Instead of helping the woman, the cops advised her to explore the option of marrying someone else,” Akhilesh tweeted. Citing a recent incident that took place in her parliamentary constituency of Azamgarh, Akhilesh quoted media reports of a woman who recently consumed poison inside a police station when the cops allegedly refused to act on her complaint of sexual assault by local goons. The cops on duty rushed her to the hospital, but she succumbed on the way. SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “Murder of a lawyer on court’s premises explains that perpetrators of crime are not scared of police action. Or how else can someone commit such a crime?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-up-tops-in-ease-of-committing-crime-graph/articleshow/87122883.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rape accused cleared of charges after 3 years in jail||MUMBAI: A 37-year-old man who spent three years in jail after being accused of repeatedly raping the 14-year-old daughter of his friend was acquitted by a special POCSO court after it observed that the statements of the alleged victim and her mother were “unbelievable”. The accused was living with the family for over eight years and the minor’s father had died four years before the alleged incident. The accused claimed that he was falsely implicated as the women did not like the fact that he was strict and enforced discipline in the household. Acquitting him, the court said that the minor’s account of rape with respect to day, date and time of the incidents, was vague. “In the background of contradictions and improvement in the prosecution evidence…, oral evidence of PW (prosecution witness) one (minor) and two (mother) does not inspire confidence. Delay of one year and four months in approaching police after the incident of rape also affects the credibility of evidence of PW one and two,” the court said. While the alleged incidents of rape took place in 2017 when the mother was away, the FIR was registered in 2018. The minor claimed that the accused had threatened her and that initially her mother did not believe her. However, the court said that it appeared strange that after serious incidents of rape, the victim remained silent due to fear of accused but after the incidents of inappropriate touch she disclosed the facts to her mother who immediately approached the police. “In the background of this fact also evidence of PW one and two appears unbelievable,” the court said. The court further said that it was not proved that the girl was a minor. The court said that the girl had not stated her date of birth during her deposition. “PW two who is victim’s mother has also not given date of birth of victim in her oral evidence. Prosecution has not filed on record any document regarding the age proof of victim girl. Prosecution has not brought on record any medical evidence by way of Ossification Test for proving age of the victim,” the court said. The mother in her cross examination said that in 2017 the girl was working in another part of the city. She also admitted that girl was talking on the mobile phone with a boy and the accused did not like this. Referring to her deposition, the court said, “As per victim’s evidence it appears that incident of rape occurred in day time, then question arises as to how she was present in the house when she was doing a job. Considering these aspects, the prosecution should have brought on record exact date and time of incidents of rape,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rape-accused-cleared-of-charges-after-3-years-in-jail/articleshow/87123871.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Nagpur||Rejuvenation of Dham river and Moti nullah may end Wardha’s water woes||Nagpur: Wardha, the land of Mahatma Gandhi's Sevagram Ashram, is the second-worst hit district after Yavatmal due to farmers’ suicides on account of severe water scarcity. A major turnaround may have happened with Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari claiming that rejuvenation of a river and nullah without disturbing the ecological balance would soon end the water shortage in the district. Gadkari, along with a couple of NGOs and corporates, worked together after aggrieved villagers approached the minister with problems arising out of water scarcity. Gadkari rushed a letter to Bajaj Group chairman emeritus Rahul Bajaj seeking help under Corporates Social Responsibility (CSR) funds for rejuvenation of Dham, a subsidiary of Vena river, passing through 26km in the district. Silt accumulated over the years had restricted the river’s flow, which often led to flooding of villages during monsoon. A decision was taken to implement the popular Buldhana pattern that involved sourcing earth for improvement/construction of national highways, state roads and railways and water conservation works through desiltation/deepening of water bodies. Bajaj immediately sanctioned Rs4 crore and roped in his NGO – Jankidevi Bajaj Gramin Vikas Sanstha (JBGVS) – to help the state irrigation department in the project. Just before the onset of monsoon, the district administration led by collector Prerna Deshbhratar along with the irrigation department officials and JBGVS members under Shiksha Mandal chairman Sanjay Bhargava started desilting and widening work on 2km stretch of Dham river. The combined workforce worked round the clock from May 27 to 31. Their efforts increased the river flow and its capacity augmented by 6%. Now, the team has planned to finish work on the remaining stretch as the monsoon has withdrawn. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) offered CSR funds of Rs2 crore for Moti nullah desilting works on Tamaswada Pattern. An NGO – Purti Sinchan Samruddhi Kalyankari Sanstha — led by a team of geologists, including Madhao Kotasthane, deepened and widened the nullah to benefit six villages that used to be inundated during the rainy season. “If every village in Maharashtra adopted the same pattern, it would become drought-free with minimal expense and suicides too would go down significantly. Building big dams involves lots of complex permissions like environment clearances, and expenses are on the higher side. The Buldhana pattern is the most cost-effective way to ensure water throughout the year without disturbing ecological balance,” Gadkari told the media during his visit to both the places on Monday. * Dham River rejuvenation Location | Yelakeli village, Selu town, Wardha CSR funds | Jankidevi Bajaj Gramin Vikas Sanstha Amount | Rs 4 crore * Moti Nullah Water Conservation Location | Mandwa village, Arvi town, Wardha CSR funds | Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust Amount | Rs 2 crore Works done | Desilting & widening Area irrigated | 2,000 hectares in each project Benefits | Flooding stopped, groundwater recharged||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rejuvenation-of-dham-river-and-moti-nullah-may-end-wardhas-water-woes/articleshow/87118550.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The establishment of a new coach maintenance shop at Tiruvarur would pave way for the extension of several new trains to attract tourists, the memorandum added.The association also extended gratitude to the MP for meeting and handing over a memorandum to chief minister M K Stalin urging to operate more passenger trains on the Karaikudi-Tiruvarur section .

The announcement came a day after three Congress MLAs — Gyasuddin Shaikh, Imran Khedawala and Mohammad Javid Pirzada — urged the state government to raise the limit on participation in a procession from 15 people to 400 people. The state unit of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) also had demanded that 400 persons be allowed in an Eid procession. Eid-e-Milad will be celebrated on Tuesday to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad. In a ‘clarification’ issued on Monday, the state government said, “400 people can take part in a procession, if it moves within a locality, mohalla or street and does not go out of that limited area”. If the procession goes out of the area, only 15 people will be allowed in it according to the guidelines issued on Sunday, said the latest release. At present, night curfew between 12 midnight and 6am is in place in eight major cities of Gujarat and the state government has already given permission to organise religious, political or social gatherings with a limit of 400 guests, said the release. For the just-concluded Navratri festival, the state government had allowed garba dance celebrations in residential societies with participation of a maximum of 400 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/400-persons-allowed-in-local-eid-processions/articleshow/87120676.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Vijay Sharma | Fabriclore||For Vijay Sharma, the call of entrepreneurship came at an odd time. A well-paid job in Abu Dhabi, a supporting wife and, two school-going daughters, offered him everything to lead a happy life. But Vijay was troubled inside. One day, a visit to the National Theatre in Abu Dhabi to watch Swades movie brought his emotions to a tipping point. “I cried that night. Then my wife told me that I was 32 and I could take a chance. If it does not click, I can still go back to my corporate life after 3-4 years. But I cannot delay it,” reminisces Vijay. He came to India in 2008, but Fabriclore took longer as he started an engineering company thinking that’s what he knew best. It was successful, from nothing to Rs 20 crore annual revenue in six years. But his friends in the venture, who also happened to be from Jaipur, pitched the idea for an online platform for fabrics. “Textile has been a core sector in India and yet largely unorganized. Other than suiting and shirting, the large segment of the industry is still fragmented. I was not entirely confident initially and lack of awareness added to that. But once we went deeper, we realized the potential of the industry. We pioneered a digital way for a product whose price and purchase were mostly accepted by touch and feel experience. It gave a new prospective to buy fabrics online,” explains Vijay Besides Raymond’s, Bombay Dyeing, Grasim, Arvind, and a few others, he says, there is no standardization of what is available in Johari Bazaar or Chandni Chowk and hundreds of traditionally handcrafted textiles across India. The venture gained traction both from domestic as well as overseas buyers. Vijay says they currently ship about 6,000 orders a month and have a lot of plans up on their sleeve to go offline as well. “Fabriclore wants to be the world’s largest ready-to-ship and customizable repository of fabrics” he adds. Creating clusters of artisans across India, roping in strategic partners, entering custom-made fabrics, opening brand stores are key to his $100 million vision and he wants to reach there in five years. Fabriclore has already raised about Rs 6 crore from Rajasthan Venture Capital Fund and Fluid Ventures as a Pre-Series A fund. The Series-A funding is under development and slated to be closed in early 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vijay-sharma-fabriclore/articleshow/87122949.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Like-minded individuals launch campaign to save River Gundlu||Mysuru: Reports of either a state’s large river or any of the country’s major sources of water – Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada, et al – being rejuvenated hardly arouse much interest among the public, since such initiatives are undertaken regularly by the authorities concerned. However, many small rivers, tributaries of their more popular and larger counterparts, seldom get the attention they deserve, despite being the lifeline of several villages that they flow through. This is perhaps why a voluntary initiative undertaken by a group of concerned citizens in Gundlupet taluk, Chamarajanagar, to revive River Gundlu – a tributary of River Kapila – has forced people to stop and take notice. It is the river, which originates at Anjani Betta, that lends Gundlupet its name. The river, which is part of the ecosystem around the Himavad Gopalaswamy Hills, joins Kapila in Nanjangud in Mysuru district. Along its meandering journey from the Anjani Betta to Nanjangud, the river flows past 200 villages, to which it is the primary source of drinking water. Unfortunately, unchecked encroachment along its banks has altered the course of the river. Eager to conserve the river and the ecology it sustains, a group of individuals from Gundlupet have formed the Gundlu River Rejuvenation Committee, which is currently spearheading an awareness campaign. Shaila Kumar, 52, said that they launched their campaign two months ago in the aftermath of Gundlupet being visited by the depredations of the flood, which was the result of human intervention. “When it rained two months ago, Gundlupet town was flooded when the Kagehalla Lake started to overflow. This inspired us to start the awareness campaign. We want to emulate the ‘Cauvery Calling’ model to save the River Gundlu,” Kumar said. Fellow member of the committee Suresh Mouri, an advocate, said that the primary objective of the campaign was to restore the river to its past glory. “We are pleased with the interest among citizens to save this river,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/like-minded-individuals-launch-campaign-to-save-river-gundlu/articleshow/87117732.cms||Shrinivasa M

The two have been taken to Vadodara for investigation. They were arrested on June 20 and June 28 by Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad. A senior ATS official said that during a probe of the bank accounts of Umar Gautam, who was arrested on June 20, it surfaced that transactions were taking place from an account in the name of one Salahuddin. “Preliminary probe had shown exhibits of ‘hawala transactions’ from this account, an audit of which is being done,” said a senior ATS official. Another officer said that Salahuddin is the ‘hawala’ link between Umar Gautam and his counterparts in the Middle East.

---||Ahmedabad||Cross-complaints filed in brawl over beating of drums||Ahmedabad: A brawl over beating of drums during Eid procession led to cross complaints being filed with the Gaekwad Haveli police. In one complaint, a 32-year-old Jamalpur resident accused a builder and his accomplices of attacking him and his friends with swords and iron pipes over the issue of beating drums during the Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi procession late on Sunday. Aslam Abdal, a resident of Abdalwad in Jamalpur Pagathia, said in his FIR that some boys were beating the drums as part of the religious procession and this did not go well with builder Asif Hussain Syed. He said Syed began abusing the boys, threatening them against playing the the usical instrument loudly. When the boys and Abdal resisted, Syed along with four others came there with swords, iron pipes and sticks and attacked them, mentioned the FIR. When they tried to protect themselves by entering a house and locking it from the inside, Syed and his men allegedly pelted stones on them. Some locals called up the police who arrived at the spot and controlled the situation. Syed too filed an FIR against Abdal and five others alleging that he suffered injuries to the head after they attacked him and others with iron pipes and sticks.

The former director of the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore, said this in his address at the 67th convocation of Gujarat Vidyapith on October 18 where he was the chief guest. Talking about the three transformations that have influenced our living, thinking, and working, he said, “First transformation is about technology, second is urbanization – job and climate change and third is about democracy.” Technology, he said, has brought us so close that we have turned into clones of each other. “More than half of our population lives in cities. Due to technology, a lot of facilities are available in villages today but the right opportunities to work, a clean environment and basic amenities are still missing from our villages,” said Chandra. To protect democracy, we must also protect the views of people with whom we do not agree, according to Chandra. At the convocation ceremony held on the university campus, medals and rewards were handed over to students. A total of 126 medals including 62 for the year 2019-’20 and 64 for the year 2020-’21 were handed over, while 1,665 degrees were awarded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/technology-has-turned-us-into-clones-of-one-another/articleshow/87120744.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Mundra heroin haul case: National Investigation Agency gets 10-day remand of three||AHMEDABAD: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Monday sent three persons to 10-day custody for interrogation in connection with the 2,988kg heroin haul at Mundra Adani Port last month. The remand was given after the probe agency argued that it suspects a conspiracy of narco-terrorism in India. The accused persons are the owners of Aashi Trading Company, Machvaram Sudhakar and Govndraju Durga Purna Vaishali; and Rajkumar P. They were produced before additional sessions judge P C Joshi, who was in-charge of the special court. The custody of the accused had been obtained from the special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) court in Bhuj. They were arrested by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on September 17 and the Bhuj court remanded them in custody till October 4. After the probe was transferred to the NIA by the Union home ministry, the NIA obtained the custody of case papers and the accused persons. While the DRI had slapped charges under the NDPS Act, the NIA invoked the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in this case. The NIA sought the remand of the accused for 10 days. The NIA’s special prosecutor, Amit Nair, stated that the agency wants to probe the larger conspiracy of international level in the smuggling of the heroin cache worth about Rs 21,000 crore. He said it appears to be an attempt involving narco-terrorism in India and the agency suspects a foreign hand. He said it is necessary to find out the involvement of others, particularly those living in foreign countries. The contraband was imported from Afghanistan and shipped from Bandar Abbas port of Iran, he submitted. The accused persons were defended by a lawyer provided by the legal service authority. They claimed innocence and ignorance about the case. On September 11, the DRI officials found a large quantity of contraband in containers of talc powder imported from Afghanistan. The accused persons were arrested from Vijayawada and brought to Gujarat after getting transit remand from a Chennai court on September 17. When they were produced before the special NDPS court in Bhuj for remand, the judge questioned the company’s motive in importing the consignment to Mundra port. It is far from Vijayawada, which itself is close to a few ports in the eastern coast of the country. The judge also questioned whether the Mundra port officials had any role in this episode or whether the port authority benefited from such imports. The court asked whether there is any system to scan and check consignments. The court ordered the DRI to probe these aspects, particularly when “Kutch coast has become hub for importing/smuggling contraband in huge quantity from Pakistan and Afghanistan worth crores of rupees”. The threat to the security of the nation was also cited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/narco-terror-whiff-nia-gets-10-day-remand-of-3-in-mundra-heroin-haul-case/articleshow/87120753.cms||---
---||Nagpur||BJP to organize morcha demanding pending funds housing scheme||Nagpur: The BJP has announced a morcha on October 27 to protest against the state government for allegedly not releasing funds allocated under the housing scheme. BJP leaders say the Ramai Gharkul Yojna (RGY) is a housing scheme benefiting economically backward people, and the current government is not releasing funds for its implementation. BJP state secretary Dharmpal Meshram said, “When Devendra Fadnavis was the chief minister, he ensured that Nagpur got over Rs14 crore in his first year of office. Then in June 2017, Rs 25 crore was released.” The party alleged that Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers are not in favour of helping the needy. Meshram said, “Ever since MVA came to power, Nagpur has not received even a single rupee under RGY. Our guardian minister Nitin Raut has not done anything to ensure that these funds are sourced from state coffers.” He said that regardless of the political party, all constituents of MVA are acting in a similar fashion. “Be it Sharad Pawar or now the self-proclaimed secular Uddhav Thackeray, they only take the name of Phule-Shahu-Ambedkar but do not work for those who believe in that ideology. It is such a shame that now, Nagpur is not getting a single penny for this scheme,” said Meshram. The BJP leader added that the waiting list of beneficiaries under this scheme was getting longer. “To fight for these people, BJP will take out a morcha from Samvidhan Chowk to district collectorate. While all top BJP leaders will be there, we request the beneficiaries to also join in,” said Meshram. He refuted the charge that BJP was raking up this issue because civic polls are due next year. Meshram said, “BJP does not pick up issues with an eye on polls. We are taking it up because it affects a lot of beneficiaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-to-organize-morcha-demanding-pending-funds-housing-scheme/articleshow/87118567.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Kingpin of Bangladeshi dacoits’ gang killed in encounter in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: The kingpin of the gang of Bangladeshi dacoits that had been on the rampage across four states was killed in an encounter in Gomtinagar early on Monday. Hamza, the leader of the gang busted a week ago, was carrying a cash reward of Rs 50,000 on his head. His gang had committed over 50 dacoities in four states. Three policemen, including head constable Narendra Bahadur Singh, and constables Ram Niwas Shukla and Mukesh Chaudhary, suffered gunshot injuries in the exchange of fire at 3.30am. Hamza was running a meticulously organised unit and trained youths to jump 15-foot walls, cut grilles with hacksaw blades, pliers and open doorknobs with screwdrivers. Hamza’s luck ran out when he was spotted by police and shot dead in Lucknow, though his five accomplices managed to escape. Hamza’s name as the mastermind had surfaced on October 11 when police arrested three dacoits Sheikh Rubel aka Rabi-ul, Alam aka Al Amin and Rabi-ul, all Bangladesh nationals, after an encounter though Hamza had fled. Lucknow Police commissioner Dhruva Kant Thakur said Hamza was part of dacoities on October 6 and December 23 in 2020 and September 15 this year in the city. “Three dacoities were committed by the gang in Rohaniya police station of Varanasi,” added Thakur. He was also wanted for a dacoity in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, one at Anand Vihar, New Delhi, and one in Jaipur, Rajasthan, said crime branch officials. DCP, East, Sanjiv Suman said the team got a tip off about the gang having assembled near the railway underpass close to Dayal Paradise and planning to strike. When cops aimed dragon light at them, the dacoits started firing indiscriminately at the police team. Police opened fire in retaliation and saw one dacoit getting hit. He was rushed to CHC Chinhat and later to Civil Hospital where doctors declared him dead. Police identified the deceased as Hamza after an identity card with the name written in Bangla was found on his person. The cops also recovered a .30 bore pistol, a magazine, live cartridge, four bullet shells, country-made pistol, a backpack, two SIM cards, 1,000 Bangladeshi takas in currency and a platform ticket from him. Officials said Hamza was wily and used to plan dacoities in detail before storming the targeted house. “He used to choose areas having palatial buildings. His gang members used Google Maps to locate the house close to railway tracks. After plundering the house, the gang members used to run along tracks till they reached the nearest railway station. They never used phones before or after a dacoity,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kingpin-of-bdeshi-dacoits-gang-killed-in-encounter-in-city/articleshow/87122964.cms||---

The petition was filed by Samkit Infracon challenging the judicial functioning and adjudication by RERA in a complaint filed by an allottee for possession of a shop in a complex being put up by the promoter. Petitioner’s advocates Vishal Dave and Nipun Singhvi submitted that RERA passed the order on May 20, 2021 whereas the authority itself had on May 13 passed an administrative order in form of a circular that judicial functioning was suspended till May 31 due to Covid, except hearing of urgent cases. The lawyers contended that the RERA could not have passed the order on May 20 when all the judicial proceedings were suspended. Further, it was argued that RERA had not published any cause for the hearing on the day or for pronouncement of order. Even on the date of hearing, the authority had not intimated the promoter about the proceedings. The order could not have been passed without hearing the promoter and alleged that it was a violation of principles of natural justice. The HC has posted further hearing on November 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-notice-to-gujarat-rera/articleshow/87120734.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi feels sting with first dengue death||NEW DELHI: This year’s first dengue death was reported from Sarita Vihar in which a 35-year-old woman lost her life due to the vector-borne disease. Though the death was reported on September 26, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) took time to investigate the reason. So far this year, 723 cases of dengue have been reported, including 243 within the past one week and 382 this month till October 16. In comparison, 395 cases were reported during the same period last year and 644 in 2019. “The woman was admitted in Holy Family Hospital on September 20 in a late stage of the disease. Her condition deteriorated on the third day of admission and she was shifted to the ICU. She was declared dead on September 26,” SDMC mentioned in a statement. The statement added, “The public health department has taken control measures in the neighbourhood and checked 426 houses for mosquito breeding. Violations were found in 12 houses. Later, fogging was done in 323 houses, 10 were issued legal notices for lapses and three were challaned.” SDMC has issued 45,840 legal notices and prosecuted 5,218 people. Out of 72 lakh houses checked this year, mosquito breeding was found at 57, 547. A senior SDMC official said four types of virus strains were in circulation. “According to scientists, when two strains circulate together, fatality remains high. This year two strains — type 1 & 2 — are circulating, but things are under control. Also, despite heavy rain and breeding of mosquitoes, there has not been an unexpected hike in cases of vector-borne diseases,” added the official. As part of healthcare arrangements, the civic bodies have dedicated more beds for dengue patients and delayed non-critical surgeries. “A 40-bed dengue ward has been created, but as 75 such patients were admitted, they were accommodated in other wards. A surgical ward has been converted into a dengue ward. Elective surgeries have been put on hold,” said a senior doctor at Swami Dayanand Hospital in east Delhi. Last week, 15 new cases of malaria were reported, taking the total number to 142. In comparison, 199 cases were reported in 2020 and 535 in 2019 during this period. However, one death due to malaria was reported last year. Further, seven cases of chikungunya were reported last week taking the total to 69 compared with 73 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-feels-sting-with-first-dengue-death/articleshow/87120823.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Varanasi||Kushinagar set to take off onrunway of devpt, connectivity||Gorakhpur: An important Buddhist pilgrimage centre, where Buddhists believe Gautam Buddha attained Mahaparinirvana after his death, Kushinagar is all set to take off on the runway of development and connectivity in East Uttar Pradesh. Cultural relations and tourism development will get a boost with the inauguration of Kushinagar International Airport by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 20. He will also lay the foundation of a Government Medical College on the occasion. Kushinagar International Airport has the biggest runway (3.2-Km-long and 45-meter-wide) in the state with a capacity of eight flights — four arrivals and four departures per hour. As per Kushinagar administration, PM Modi along with VVIP guests will visit Mahaparinirvan temple of Lord Buddha for darshan-pujan (prayers) and from the same day a three-day international Buddhist conclave will also be organised. Local officials said that those following Buddhism wish to visit Kushinagar at least once in life, and with direct air connectivity to countries with sizeable Buddhist populations, including Japan, China, South Korea, Sri Lanka, both tourism and cultural relations will be developed and expanded. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is monitoring the preparations of the programme. On October 8, he held a review meeting with peoples’ representatives in Gorakhpur. On October 12, he visited Kushinagar and took stock of the preparation. It is likely that he may visit the place again before PM Modi’s programme. The PM will also lay the foundation of a medical college in Kushinagar on October 20. Before 2017 the area was mostly affected by encephalitis. After taking over, CM Yogi made various arrangements, including cleanliness, availability of potable water, regular fogging and mosquito control and vaccination to control the deadly disease. Although encephalitis is under control in the area, people still need to go to places like Gorakhpur, Varanasi and Lucknow for high-quality medical treatment. With PM Modi gifting a medical college to the area, it will be a real blessing for the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kushinagar-set-to-take-off-onrunway-of-devpt-connectivity/articleshow/87118623.cms||---

It was not so bad about six months ago when we reached here in search of livelihood,” lamented Gautam Rishidev, who is staying in Lara Ganjipora area of Kulgam district in J&K. Gautam (32), who is a resident of Narpatganj block, works as a daily wager in a private building construction company. He is among the 20 workers from Araria district staying there. Ashish Bhagat, the panchayat samiti member of Mirzapur panchayat, told this newspaper that the residents are praying for the safe return of their relatives from J&K.

They are waiting for the farmers outfits’ to make their demands. With the concensus of the farmers present, Shetti declares what amount they should get for their sugar cane crop. Usually, Shetti’s followers stop the transportation of sugar cane to the mills that do not agree to the price. This year, most mills have already declared that they will pay the farmers as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP). However this time, the farmers are hoping to get an amount in addition to the FRP. Savkar Madnaik, a close aide of Shetti, said, “The input cost for sugar cane farming has increased due to the increase in the costs of fuel and fertilisers. The FRP fixed by the central government is not in accordance to the increased input cost. The sugar prices in wholesale and retail markets are between Rs34 per kg and Rs39 per kg and the prices will most likely increase as Diwali approaches. Therefore, the mills are in position to pay more than the FRP.” As per government’s instructions, the crushing season should begin not earlier than October 15. However, very few mills have started crushing. The workers of Shetti’s outfit take to streets, puncture tyres of trollies and sometimes stop the movement of vehicles towards the mills. The mills have to suffer due to such violent activities and finally succumb to the demands of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sugar-mills-waiting-to-see-outcome-of-shettis-meet/articleshow/87118645.cms||---

The tribunal has ordered removal of unauthorised constructions from the Chartoda Kabrastan at Gomtipur, Pir Kamal Kabrastan, Lalghumti Kabrastan and Musa Suhag Kabrastan at Shahibaug. The order also includes a cemetery on which the city police commissioner has allegedly encroached upon and the place is being used as its parking slot.  The tribunal has noted that more than 300 households exist on Chartoda graveyard in violation of the law and such illegally constructed houses, garages, shops, shopping centres should be immediately removed from all graveyards and open waqf lands belonging to Idgahs. Besides ordering removal of encroachments from the graveyards under Section 54 of the Waqf Act, Tribunal’s chairman I A Shaikh and member Rizwan Qadri have also directed the Board to take legal action against the trustees and mutavallis (caretakers) of waqf properties for their failure to stop encroachment on graveyards, which is growing day by day. Since all major graveyards in the city are managed by the Ahmedabad Sunni Muslim Waqf Committee, a charitable organisation, the tribunal has order the Committee to place an action taken report by December 27 showing what action it has taken against encroachers on basis of this order, which was passed by the tribunal on October 12. The tribunal’s order came in response to 11 suits filed by people living in houses constructed on the Chartoda graveyard. The suits were withdrawn after submission that the Waqf Committee has decided to prosecute the cases before the State Waqf Board. It also recorded that the Waqf Board has informed the litigants that there are several suits pending in the Gujarat high court with regard to possession of superstructures on graveyard lands. The tribunal said that considering the submissions made before it, it is the duty of the chief executive officer of the Waqf Board to see that encroachments on graveyards and waqf land are removed forthwith under provisions of section 54 of the Act. The tribunal recorded litigants submission that repeated representations about illegal encroachment were made before the Waqf Board, but no action has been taken. The tribunal has ordered construction of compound walls around graveyards and directed city police commissioner to provide protection to Board officials, trustees and mutavallis during construction of boundary walls. The municipal commissioner has also been ordered to assist the Board and trusts in monitoring of graveyards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remove-encroachments-from-city-graveyards-immediately-waqf-tribunal/articleshow/87120770.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd gush: Prices crash on power exchange||AHMEDABAD: The prices on the power exchange crashed recently after Tata Power and Adani Power resumed their supply to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL), the state-owned electricity company. The prices on the exchange had skyrocketed over the past few weeks. The companies are supplying power from their imported coal-fired thermal plants in Mundra, Kutch.  Both the companies recently agreed to supply power to GUVNL for a higher variable tariff of Rs 4.5 per unit on a short-term basis, said a senior state government official. In the power-purchase agreements with the companies, the tariff had been less than Rs 2.5 per unit. While Tata Power last week agreed to supply 1,800MW to GUVNL, Adani Power Mundra Ltd (APMUL) began the supply of 1,200MW to the state-run electricity company from October 17, the official added. This has led to the softening of prices on the Indian Energy Exchange (IEE), the country’s power trading platform. “Tata Power is currently supplying about 1,000MW to the state and is in the process of ramping up this capacity to 1,800MW. APMUL has also started its supply,” said a GUVNL official. “This is a major factor that has contributed to the decline in prices on the power exchange.” The official said other factors that led to the fall in prices on the exchange are rains in Delhi and Haryana and a decline in the overall demand. On October 14, GUVNL purchased about 4,000MW of power from the exchange for a weighted average cost of Rs 13.8 per unit. “In comparison, on Monday, after Tata Power and Adani Power began supply of power of over 2,000MW, GUVNL’s purchase from the IEE went down to 1,800MW,” the official said. “Also, the weighted average price was only Rs 4.3 per unit.” Tata Power, Adani Power, and Essar Power had been supplying about 4,000MW to GUVNL for which they have entered into power-purchase agreements. Essar Power shut down its 1,200MW Salaya power unit in March this year saying that the rising international coal prices have made the project unviable. Over the past one-and-a-half months, Tata Power and Adani Power had discontinued their power supplies to GUVNL citing similar reasons. But on Monday, an APMUL spokesperson said: “APMUL has agreed to supply 1200MW, which it was generating and supplying to grid to Gujarat, basis the agreement to specially help the state at this stage of their requirement.” The spokesperson added: “Gujarat has sought supply on this special package till 5th Nov, which Mundra plant has offered in the national interest.” The country is staring at a power crisis with a large number of thermal power plants across the country being shut down or working at lower capacities due to coal supply problems. So Gujarat, a power surplus state, has been forced to buy costly power from the exchange. In October, the state’s power bill from the IEE shot up to Rs 1,650 crore for the first eighteen days. In comparison, GUVNL bought power worth Rs 1,035 crore from the exchange for all of September, according IEX data. The arrangement with Tata Power and Adani Power is only till November 5 as the government is of the view that the power crisis will ease after Diwali due to demand dip, said government sources. As for Essar Power, an official of the group refused to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guvnl-gush-prices-crash-on-power-exchange/articleshow/87120813.cms||Maulik Pathak

The Prasad will be distributed by the Participatory Rural Development Foundation (PDRF) with the consent of the administration. The chairman of PDRF, Ram Chet Chowdhary said, “Siddharthnagar district is related to Lord Buddha’s birth place area and Kalanamak rice of the district is known for its taste, aroma and nutritional properties. The Yogi government gave global recognition to the rice by making it ODOP of Siddharthnagar. When the gift of Kalanamak rice will be distributed among the Bouddh religion followers and VVIP guests its global branding will be strengthened.” Over the historical and religious value of Kalanamak rice, Chowdhary said, “The Prasad will be given on Purnima (full moon) which is important for Sanatan and Bouddh religion followers from spiritual and religious point of view. It is believed that Lord Budhdha broke his fast by consuming kheer of Kalanamak rice at the bank of Hiranyavati river and also distributed among his disciples.” “Lord Buddha advised farmers to grow Kalanamak rice and Chinese traveller Fahyyan. Budhdha is also said to have given the grains of this rice to farmers of the region and asked them to grow it in their fields. Chinese traveller Fa Hien also described Kalanamak rice and Birdpur block of Siddharthnagar district as famous for cultivation of this rice. However, over the years the farming of the rice decreased in land to less than 10 thousand hectares but now with the efforts of the state government it has increased to more than 50 thousand hectares,” he added. CM Yogi declared Kalanamak rice as ODOP for Siddharthnagar and the state government is also making a common facility center with Rs 12 crore. The Union government has declared Kalanamak rice as ODOP for Siddharthnagar, Basti, Gorakhpur, Maharajganj and Santkabir Nagar districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kala-namak-rice-to-be-distributed-as-buddha-prasad-at-kushinagar-airport-inauguration/articleshow/87118647.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Three dams to be opened today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged the people residing near the dams, the shutters of which are being opened, to be vigilant. On the basis of the decision of an expert committee, the government has decided to open the shutters of Idukki, Idamalayar and Pamba dams. While Idukki dam will be opened at 11am on Tuesday, Idamalayar will be opened at 6am. The time for opening the shutters of Pamba dam will be decided on Tuesday. The chief minister requested the public to abide by the instructions provided by the officials concerned. He said that there are 240 relief camps being operated in the state at present, in which there are 9,081 people belonging to 2,541 families. The government had appointed an expert committee consisting of additional chief secretary (water resources), principal secretary (revenue and disaster management), commissioner (disaster management) and chairman and MD of KSEB to decide on the opening of the dam shutters of various dams across the state, in the wake of the heavy rains in the state in the last few days. The CM convened a high-level meeting to discuss and review the prevailing conditions and the water level in the dams across the state. The expert committee will decide on which dams should be opened and which need not be, based on the water level of each of the dams. In order to avert any untoward incidents after the dam opening, the chief minister instructed that the expert committee should inform about such a decision to the respective district collectors, so that enough time is available to relocate the people residing near the banks of the rivers. The chief minister instructed that sufficient facilities, including food, clothes and facilities for bedding should be ensured in the relief camps. He said that the rescue operations are jointly being done by state and central agencies and the public. All the public residing in areas where there is likelihood of landslides must be relocated. He instructed all the district collectors to speed up the distribution of financial aid and also to collect the details of crop loss in various districts. The meeting also decided not to permit devotees at Sabarimala for Thula masa puja in the wake of Nilackal and Perunthenaruvi receiving rains of more than 20cm on Sunday. The government considered factors like rise in the water level in the rivers after shutters of Kakki dam was opened, landslides being reported from inside the forests and the heavy rain forecast from Wednesday while restricting devotees. The CM also instructed that the colleges should be reopened only on October 25. The meteorological department has not yet confirmed the arrival of the rains that are received in the month of Thulam, but in the first 17 days of the ongoing month, the state has already received 84% of the rains that are usually received in Thulam. In addition, cyclones are also expected in the period from October to December, he said. A team of NDRF personnel has been deputed to Kuttanad in Alappuzha as there is likelihood of increase in water levels there with the Kakki dam shutters being opened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/three-dams-to-be-opened-today/articleshow/87120849.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Result exposes cracks in opposition, indicates 2022 UP assembly polls outcome: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Congratulating BJP-backed candidate Nitin Agarwal on his victory for the post of deputy Speaker in the state Assembly, CM Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the result had “exposed” the cracks in opposition unity and was an indication of 2022 UP assembly election results. Agarwal is the son of former state minister Naresh Agarwal who switched from Samajwadi Party to BJP. Taking a potshot at SP failure as the largest Opposition party, the Chief Minister said BJP waited for a full four-and-a-half years, but SP did not put forward any names for the post in that time. “Finally, in view of the last six months of the remaining period, BJP fulfilled the tradition,” he said. Yogi also expressed “sympathy” for SP candidate Narendra Verma, saying that had the party made him a candidate four years ago, he could have possibly won. Of 364 valid votes, Verma got 60 votes. Yogi said that despite knowing the result in advance, his party played a “game of betrayal” with him. Expressing happiness at the House getting a “young, energetic and experienced deputy Speaker”, Yogi said that “technically” Agarwal was also a member of SP and thus BJP “did follow” the tradition of the House. Exhorting SP ranks to rise above “parivarvad” (nepotism), he said that “family is the state” for Samajwadi Party while BJP believes that the entire state is family. The CM also remarked that leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary was a “gentleman” who believed in dialogue but “did not have the strength” to bear the party contradictions. “This is why unnecessary contests take place in the House,” said Yogi. He also referred to SP not taking part in the 36-hour special session held on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019. “When topics like poverty, illiteracy, women’s upliftment and youth welfare were discussed, SP remained absent,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/result-exposes-cracks-in-oppn-indicates-2022-outcome-yogi/articleshow/87123071.cms||---

The transporters say their expenses have increased due to continuous increase in diesel prices (Rs100.67 per litre in Nagpur city on Monday). More than 1,000 trucks owned by local transporters from the region are off the roads. “The transporters are demanding increase in freight charges,” said Raja Majumdar, representative of a cement manufacturing unit in the region. Sources in the industry said that though road transportation was stopped, cement bags are being transported by railway. Majumdar said that on Monday, local transporters refused to load 2,500 tonne of cement bags from Kalamna railway yard. The strike is likely to adversely affect the realty sector. The worst-affected is Chandrapur district having at least half-a-dozen cement factories. “Unless the demand is met, transporters will not ferry cement bags,” said Kuku Marwah, president of Nagpur Truckers Unity, adding that it is part of the strike demanding freight revision. Sources in industry said the demand from transporters of the region is not being met due to lack of unity among their counterparts across the country. Recently, truckers in neighbouring Chhattisgarh had resorted to strike, forcing the cement factories there to increase freight charges by 25%, said the sources. Manufacturing units have increased cement bag prices manifold citing escalation in cost of raw products and transportation charges. Sources said the companies are, however, ignoring the demand for an increase in freight charges. Marwah said representatives of various truckers’ unions from Vidarbha convened a meeting in Nagpur on Monday. The meet was organized by Nagpur Truckers Unity. The transporters threatened to keep their vehicles off the roads till the cement companies accepted their demand. High operational cost coupled with rising fuel prices are eating into margins of logistics and transport companies, said transporters. They said the continuous hike in diesel prices has left them with with no option but to either shut business or extend the strike until the demand is met. Marwah said that to control the fuel prices, the central government should impose GST instead of other taxes like VAT and state taxes. “It will reduce the fuel prices significantly,” he said and added if the central government fails to take corrective measures, freight prices of all commodities will increase significantly leading to a hike in prices of all commodities. “Diesel price hike has badly affected the transport business,” said Pyare Khan, managing director of Ashmi Group which has a fleet of 400 vehicles with pan-India presence. Khan told TOI that the number of transport vehicles on the road is higher than required. “With fuel price hike, owners will look to cut down fleet size wherever needed, thus resulting in probems for small transporters, especially single truck owners,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/truckers-ferrying-cement-on-strike-to-demand-50-freight-charges-hike/articleshow/87120485.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

About 595 defaulting persons have been identified on whom action has to be taken by October 31. As per the orders, a person whose UD tax is about Rs 1 lakh a year or a person whose total default amount over the years for UD tax is around Rs 10 lakh, has to be taken up on priority. List of people who are defaulting has been identified and given to zonal offices. Around 211 people are such who are yet to pay over Rs 10 lakh for UD tax and around 385 people with more than Rs 1 lakh UD tax due. Shyam Jangid, revenue officer at JMC-Greater said, “Commissioner Yagya Mitra Deo has taken this initiative of identifying the defaulters. We have to take strict action against such people, to increase the revenue.” The orders of the commissioner specifically state that this is applicable for people in last financial year which means any amount pending till March 2021. The decision was taken as most businessmen have been given relaxations this year due to the lockdown. JMC-Greater and Heritage, both are yet to get more than Rs 300 crore of UD tax money. With the pandemic being tough on people’s pockets, it has become even more difficult for small business owners to get the money, as most of them had to bear losses when the markets were shut for months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-greater-identifies-595-ud-tax-defaulters/articleshow/87120865.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||J&K must take stern action in targeted killing cases: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Monday said the Jammu and Kashmir administration must take stern action in the recent incidents of killing of people from Bihar. Responding to a media query after his janata darbar programme, Nitish said, “The J&K administration should also provide necessary protection in the areas where workers from other states reside and take necessary steps to ensure that such targeted attacks on non-locals do not reoccur in the Kashmir Valley.” Two labourers from Araria were killed and a third one was critically injured in Kulgam district of south Kashmir on Sunday. Nitish said the Sunday incident was the third in which people from Bihar were killed in J&K. “I spoke to LG of J&K, Manoj Sinha, over phone and expressed my serious concern over the targeted killing of non-locals in the union territory. I told Sinha that people of Bihar are fully concerned over the recurrent killings of our people. Sinha assured me that he was looking into the matter,” Nitish said. “But it is a fact that something wrong is happening in the valley. Some people are deliberately attacking those who had gone there for work. The way two labourers from Bihar were selectively killed after entering their house… We have alerted the J&K administration,” he said. Nitish said people are free to go anywhere across the country to work. “People from poor family background usually go to other places for work. But, such workers are being killed in J&K. Stern action must be taken in such cases….. We are deeply hurt over the killing incidents,” he added. Altogether four natives of Bihar have so far been killed in targeted attacks in J&K in the last two weeks. On Saturday, Arbind Kumar Sah from Bihar’s Banka district was killed in a terrorist attack. Arbind used to sell ‘panipuri’ in Srinagar. Earlier, on October 5, one Birendra Paswan from Bhagalpur district was shot dead by the terrorists in Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jk-must-take-stern-action-in-targeted-killing-cases-cm/articleshow/87120882.cms||Madan Kumar

But, he took up the responsibility (CM post) to drive the state on the development path. The CM also said he wanted to stay away from taking up any political position after achieving Telangana. “But, I took over as CM after some Telangana leaders and intellectuals expressed concerns with me that problems will arise in the new state if the important CM post was given to new leaders who lack knowledge on Telangana issues and experience,” he said. KCR’s remarks at a meeting in Telangana Bhavan come in the backdrop of opposition parties repeatedly raising questions on him taking over as CM after Telangana became a reality seven years ago. Former minister and Dalit leader Motkupalli Narsimhulu joined the TRS at the meeting. KCR said Telangana had achieved several milestones and witnessed development in the last seven years. “We have addressed drinking water, electricity and farmers’ issues. Still, there is scope for development and we will continue to develop the state on all fronts,” he said. He also explained the problems faced during the statehood movement and how he had gone to BSP chief Mayawati’s house 19 times seeking her party’s support for the cause of Telangana. KCR said Dalit Bandhu scheme would become a role model for the entire country. He said Dalit Bandhu was not an election or political stunt and would continue till his last breath. He said the scheme will be implemented at all cost. He also said bandhu schemes for BCs and poor in upper and other castes will also be implemented across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/never-hankered-after-cms-post-says-kcr/articleshow/87120855.cms||Koride Mahesh

A delegation of MNS functionaries led by city unit president Suhas Dashrathe on Monday met the authorities concerned to discuss the delay in improving the condition of the pothole-riddled road. “During today’s discussion, the authorities assured us that they would do the needful at the earliest. We urged them to keep their promise and improve the road condition before Diwali, failing which we would burst fire crackers under the chairs of the officials,” said Dashrathe. VIP Road, a stretch between CIDCO bus-stand and Harsul T-point, is riddled with potholes and poses a risk to road users. The condition of the road is bad despite repair carried earlier this year. On October 6, the MNS had staged a protest in this regard by performing a mock puja of potholes. During Monday’s meeting, MNS functionaries also raised the issue of the under-construction Beed bypass road. “Work on the road is moving at a snail’s pace. No standard operating procedure is being followed while constructing the road, causing inconvenience to locals. The road invariably witnesses accidents due to its bad condition,” MNS leader Sandeep Kulkarni alleged. The authorities concerned could not be reached for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mns-to-burst-fire-crackers-in-pwd-office-to-protest-poor-condition-of-vip-road/articleshow/87118744.cms||---

---||Delhi||The other virus: Occupancy high in top Delhi hospitals||NEW DELHI: The number of dengue cases has increased by 20-30% in Delhi over the past few weeks.  Hospitals say the demands for beds, which had reduced significantly as Covid-19 cases reduced from July onwards, have also gone up. “As Covid-19 cases reduced, many people who had been postponing elective surgeries returned. At the same time, there was a significant rise in the demand for hospital beds owing to the rise in seasonal illnesses. All this resulted in high occupancy,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary and critical care at Apollo Hospital. Fortis, Sir Ganga Ram and Max hospitals also said 70-80% of their beds were full. “We have turned our H1N1 or swine flu ward into a dengue ward in view of the increased cases,” said an official at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. At Lok Nayak Hospital, medical director Dr Suresh Kumar said they had 19 dengue-related hospitalisations within the last four days. “We have patients coming from both Delhi and the nearby cities,” he added. Dengue virus strains are of four types. Type-I causes classic dengue fever, type-II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, type-III causes fever without shock and type-IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. This year, the type-II strain has been predominant in the city and nearby areas. Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor, department of medicine at AIIMS, said type-II was known to cause more severe symptoms, but the current trends didn’t reflect that. “The proportion of severity is the same as earlier years, but cases have certainly gone up,” he added. “We have seen a significant increase in the number of dengue patients during this season in the last few years and this year is no exception. In addition to fever, patients come with pain in the abdomen, body ache and low platelets. Most patients have moderate disease severity,” said Dr Vineeta Taneja, director of Fortis Shalimar Bagh. Dengue is a self-limiting disease. Most patients recover well with symptomatic treatment, but doctors say one should not ignore the warning signs, such as pain in the abdomen, bleeding from natural orifices, rapid fall in the platelet count or extreme weakness. “Dengue patients with severe symptoms usually become critical after 3-4 days of fever. If patients are properly managed during this phase, then chances of complications become very less and they may recover completely. However, once a patient falls into a critical stage, then the chances of recovery reduce. The patient may take longer to recover and even die,” said Dr Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-other-virus-occupancy-high-in-top-hosps/articleshow/87121037.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

KSEB authorities here on Monday said the decision to drain 100cumecs (cubic metre per second) water from the dams was on a precautionary note in view of heavy rain forecast for three days from Wednesday. “The dams shutters are being lifted marginally to make room for more water inflow into the reservoir, in case of heavy rains in the coming days,” said B Ashok, KSEB chairman and managing director. The flow of water from the dams was 2,500cumecs during the 2018 floods. In comparison, the outflow from the dams would be very small this time, he noted. The water storage level in Idukki and Idamalayar dams is 93.4% and 90.15% as on Monday evening. “This means that Idukki dam can contain 1,363.86MCM more water before it reaches the full reservoir level. Similarly, Idamalayar dam can hold 917.56MCM more water before the water level in the reservoir touches the FRL level,” Ashok added. Idukki and Idamalayar dams are currently on orange alert and Kakki dam is already spilling. The board officials said there could be changes in the schedule of operation of the dam shutters in case of any unexpected emergencies. “As per the current plans, people could be given enough time to move away from the banks downstream of dams,” KSEB officials said. Pathanamthitta district administration has been given the mandate to decide when to lift the Pamba dam shutters scheduled on Tuesday. According to officials, the catchment areas of Idukki and Idamalayar dams have been receiving very heavy rains. “The rains in catchment areas on October 16 and 17 were the highest in the last 50 years,” they said. The water level in Idukki reservoir showed a sudden rise of 4.24ft within a day on Saturday and it was behind the sudden decision of officials to open the shutters of Idukki reservoir. KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP) Supriya S told TOI that three shutters of Cheruthoni reservoir will be opened 35cm each on Tuesday morning at 11am. KSEB officials said around 4.5 lakh electricity connections were affected and most have been restored. As on Monday, 45,000 connections are yet to be restored. The loss to KSEB was assessed at Rs 17.54 crore on Monday. Power connections in several areas have been switched off to avert more disasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/idukki-idamalayar-dams-to-spill-100cumecs-water-from-today/articleshow/87120917.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Preparing to move Supreme Court for an early CBI probe: Meenakshi||KANPUR: Meenakshi, the widow of city businessman Manish Gupta, who died following alleged torture by the police during a raid at a hotel in Gorkahpur on September 27, on Monday said that following the delay in Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe, she is preparing to file a petition in the Supreme Court seeking early probe into the case by the agency. To recall, the state government had recently recommended a CBI probe into the death of Manish Gupta. A recommendation to this effect has been made to the Central government on the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish K Awasthi had stated in a press statement. “Till the time the CBI takes over the inquiry, the special investigation team (SIT) set up for the purpose will probe the matter, transferring the case to Kanpur from Gorakhpur,” the statement had stated further. The CBI is, however, yet to take up the case. Meenakshi on Monday told reporters that the chief minister gave financial help to the family, job on the post of OSD in Kanpur Development Authority, formed a SIT from Kanpur Commissionerate to investigate the matter and got all the accused arrested. “However, the CBI investigation is yet to start. Be it police officers or public representatives, till date I have not got satisfactory reply with regard to the CBI investigation from any of them,” she said. She added that she will continue the fight to get justice for her husband. “Now I am preparing to file a petition in the Supreme Court,” she said and added, “Also, I do not want to get the investigation done by the Lucknow unit of CBI. In the petition, I will ask for investigation by the Delhi unit of CBI.” Meenakshi also said that she has no complaint with the SIT. “SIT is doing its job but Gorakhpur Police is hell bent on destroying the evidence. If important evidence is destroyed, it will weaken the case and the accused policemen will not be punished for their sins as they should be.” She also said that since the accused are policemen, they have links across the state and they would wield their influence and spoil the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/preparing-to-move-sc-for-anearly-cbi-probe-meenakshi/articleshow/87118751.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Businessman held for molesting actress on Delhi-Mumbai flight||MUMBAI: A businessman from Ghaziabad has been arrested for allegedly sexually harassing an actress on a Delhi-Mumbai flight. The woman had alerted the cabin crew and approached the police soon after the incident. The 40-year-old woman who lives in Mumbai had gone to Delhi on October 1. On October 3, she boarded a flight to return to Mumbai. The aircraft landed at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai around 11am. She got up and opened the overhead storage to take out her handbag. According to her complaint, she felt a stranger suddenly grab her from behind by the waist and pull her towards him to which she reacted in anger. At this, the stranger remarked that he did not realise she was a woman and thought it was a male co-passenger. After initial mix-up, bizman booked for sex harassmentThe woman complained to a cabin crew member who asked her to mail her complaint to their customer relations team. The cabin crew also asked a man to step aside. They asked him for his name and seat number. The passenger gave his name as Rajeev. The same evening, the woman mailed the airline. She then approached Versova police station that, in turn, directed her to Sahar police station in whose jurisdiction the alleged incident had occurred. She told the police she was shaken and confided in a friend who offered her support. After lodging an FIR, the Sahar police reached out to the airline asking for details of Rajeev. The airline responded with his contact details as well as of the others travelling with him. When the police made inquiries with him, though, Rajeev replied he was not involved in the crime. He then sent a photograph of himself and his co-travellers to the police. From the photo, the woman identified another passenger, Nitin B, as the one who had allegedly molested her. It is not clear from the FIR if the person asked to step aside by the flight crew was Rajeev like he said or Nitin. “We re-approached the airline and asked for details of all passengers on board that day. Nitin’s seat number was verified. After establishing he was involved in the crime, his name was added to the FIR,” said a cop. Nitin (36), who runs a business in Ghaziabad, appeared before the Sahar police station and was taken into custody on October 14. He has been booked under IPC provisions for sexual harassment. Police have also written to a court in Bhoiwada about recording the woman’s statement before a magistrate under CrPC.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Standard I, II children study together on return to schools after 1.5 years||By-  Poviet KaurCHANDIGARH: Students of primary classes arrived in government schools of Chandigarh on Monday after almost one and a half years. Some of them were excited, while some, especially those who had never been to school before, tried to adapt. Schools have reopened for primary classes for the first time since the Covid breakout. Children have been studying in online mode so far. Many schools only called students of classes III and IV and others also called students of classes I and II. However, thin attendance indicated that parents were taking tentative steps towards normalcy. On the first day, around 200 or 15% of students attended classes in UT government schools. In schools located in main sectors of the city, only about 50 to 100 children turned up. Many schools only called students of classes III and IV and others also called students of classes I and II.Principal, GMHS, Sector 29 said, “Attendance for classes I to IV was around 45%. We called all students as we did not expect them all to be present on the first day. We hope that the number of students will increase in the days to come, especially after Diwali.” Many heads of schools said attendance was low as it was only the first day and parents of many students had not responded to the permission letter. They said more students would come to schools after Diwali. Principal, GMHS, Sector 25 said, “Attendance on Day 1 was quite low. Around 30% students attended classes. Not many parents have signed consent forms but we hope that in the days to come, attendance will increase gradually.” The status of students coming to school in private schools is not yet clear. Many schools plan to start primary classes from next week. Renu Puri, principal, Vivek High school said, “We had students of class IV here for classes today and attendance was around 70%. Students of classes I to III will be called on Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/primary-classes-reopen-in-city-govt-schools/articleshow/87118752.cms||---

During the same period, the civic body has given a rebate of Rs 3 crore on penalty amount. The total property tax dues are estimated at Rs 279 crore, including Rs 104 crore basic tax and Rs 175 crore as penalty. “We have received poor response to the first phase of the amnesty scheme, but we are still hopeful about the good response in the second phase of the amnesty scheme,” said NMC officials. As per the amnesty scheme, 90% rebate on the penalty was given to the defaulters who cleared their dues between August 15 and October 15. Now, 70% rebate on penalty will be given to the defaulters paying their taxes in the second phase — between October 16 and November 31. A 50% rebate on penalty will be given if the dues are cleared between December 1 and 31, 2021, which is the third phase. The NMC recovers a 2% fine per month on tax dues from the last day of paying taxes. Moreover, it also recovers expenses of notices and warrants issued to the defaulters. The civic administration has set a property tax collection target of Rs 160 crore for the current financial year. But so far has collected only Rs 85.80 crore. The NMC needs to collect Rs 84.20 crore in the next five months to meet the target. An NMC official said they will launch a recovery drive against property tax defaulters after the amnesty scheme ends. “We have already sent notices to over 1 lakh defaulters asking them to take benefit of the amnesty scheme or face action. We will start confiscating properties of the defaulters thereafter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmcs-property-tax-amnesty-scheme-gets-poor-response/articleshow/87114242.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Jaipur||Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Heritage issues architectural control guidelines for Walled City||JAIPUR: Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC), Heritage, has issued architectural control guidelines for Walled City with an aim to preserve the World Heritage Site. The guidelines specify the structure, design and colour of the front walls of the city buildings. People have been given 30 days raise objections before final implementation. The rulers of Jaipur had a vision to establish a well-planned city in 1727. However, additions and alterations have led to the disruption of the original aesthetic character of the bazaars, facades and finish colour. Hence, guidelines have been issued to ensure structural uniformity in the city. JMC-Heritage commissioner Awadhesh Meena said, "Some of the points in the guidelines are mentioned in the Heritage Conservation and Protection Byelaws, 2020. The byelaws also mention that a separate set of guidelines has to be issued focusing on the architectural design." The instructions mention that the base colour for pillars and parapet wall of the verandah has to be Jaipur Pink. The base of stencil, ornamental details and painted borders of doors and windows shall be white. Other points specify the size and colours of signage on shops and religious places. President of Walled City Dharohar Bachao Samiti, Bharat Sharma, said, "Does the work for preservation of Heritage involve just the colour of the walls and signage. What about the basement and commercial complexes that were constructed in place of heritage buildings? The JMC-Heritage has not taken this seriously." "In fear of losing the UNESCO World Heritage label, officials are just fastening up the process. This will not benefit the residents or architecture at all," he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritage-issues-architectural-control-guidelines-for-walled-city/articleshow/87120955.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Demand for merger of fringe villages before KMC polls||Kolhapur: Activists and local politicians have resolved not to let the administration hold the election for the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) until the civic limits are extended by merging the fringe villages. The issue of bringing the villages within the KMC limits has been pending for several decades. The activists claim that now is the time to get the demand fulfilled. They will be meeting civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade, under whose watch the KMC election (which has been pending for the past year) will be held. Baba Indulkar, a pro-merger activist, said, “Citizens are suffering because the city limits have remained unchanged for years. The fringe villages have rapidly urbanised, but with no planning. The infrastructure is burdened due to such unplanned urbanisation. The merger is the natural way to address rampant urbanisation. We are ready to discuss the matter with anyone who objects to the merger.” For the past few weeks, the activists have been making efforts to reach out to various associations and stakeholders and gather support for their campaign. The merger is opposed mainly by some political leaders who have voter bases in these fringe villages. Several agitations have already taken place either in support or opposition to the merger. Former mayor R K Powar, who is also the convenor of the all-party pro-merger forum and NCP city president, said, “We have been trying to make the merger a reality for the past four decades. Now is the time to get it done. We want the KMC election to be held with the addition of new geographical areas.” Activists said some politicians — mainly MPs, MLAs and ministers — are not supportive of the merger as they do not want to get hurt politically. However, the activists added a solution is possible only with unanimous resolve ofthe political leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/demand-for-merger-of-fringe-villages-before-kmc-polls/articleshow/87118801.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik PWD seeks Rs 35cr from state to fill potholes||Nashik: The Nashik unit of the state Public Works Department (PWD) has sought Rs 35 crore from the state government to fill the potholes on 3,500km length of roads in the rural areas. These roads had taken a hit duiring the recent monsoon. The rainfall has been erratic and has led to the damage of roads creating problems for motorists travelling in the rural areas. Major cases of road damage are seen in the hilly areas of the district like in Igatpuri, Trimakeshwar, Dindori, Kalwan, Surgana and Peth talukas. The situation in the other parts like Deola, Satana, Chandwad, Nandgaon is also not good as they received far more rainfall than usual. The PWD started maintaining roads with temporary measures — by mostly using murum (soil) — to cut down the severity of potholes and ensure mobility to some extent, where the roads have been badly damaged. “During the rain, the heavy vehicles used for transportation of agriculture produce and others on damaged roads only aggravates the situation. To ensure motorable roads, we have to rely on temporary measures only as ‘tar’ cannot be used in wet conditions. The work has already started,” the officer said. Prashant Sonawane, the superintendent officer of PWD, Nashik, said more than 3,500 km road length has been damaged of the 6000 km of roads under the PWD. The work has begun at a very slow pace for two reasons, shortage of funds and the current weather condition. “As we get dry patches and hot weather, we will be able to use ‘tar’ for better repair of the roads. Currently, the rain is damaging the works done. However, as the rain withdraws the pace of work will pick up,” Sonawane said. He said, “We need about Rs 35 crore to maintain and repair these roads in the district. The same has been presented to the government through our department. We expect the funds soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-pwd-seeks-rs-35cr-from-state-to-fill-potholes/articleshow/87114270.cms||Abhilash Botekar

All these trains were those going towards Haryana, Punjab and the states where the farmers have occupied the railway tracks. Approximately 10,000 passengers were affected. The cancellation is likely to go up till the time the farmers stay on the tracks due to the stir. The rail traffic was affected on Bhiwani-Rewari, Sirsa-Rewari, Loharu-Hisar, Suratgarh-Bathinda, Sirsa-Bathinda, Hanumangarh-Bathinda, Rohtak-Bhiwani, Rewari-Sadulpur, Hisar-Bathinda, Hanumangarh-Sadulpur and Sri Ganganagar-Rewari routes. The agitation was staged by farmers’ unions to protest against the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case. No damage to public property on NWR routes was reported. Railway officials have also appealed to the passengers to check the status of the trains before going to the stations. Just 20 days back, the farmers had occupied the tracks over another agitation due to which 22 trains had been cancelled and passengers had to be refunded money. Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding the repeal of three contentious farm laws that they fear would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. The government, however, has been projecting the three laws as major agricultural reforms. Over 10 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rail-roko-nwr-cancels-20-trains-10k-passengers-hit/articleshow/87121017.cms||---

The speaker directed the joint commissioner, MC to make a detailed report and take strict action against officials delaying the process. During the inspection, Gupta found irregularities in work of files in the office and called for stern action against errant officials. He also expressed displeasure at the absence of certain employees from the office. Their seniors failed to give satisfactory replies when questioned about their absence. The Assembly Speaker said he had received several complaints from builders and representatives of various industries in Panchkula about poor functioning of the fire station office. They complained that in some cases, NOCs were issued in just two days while some cases were kept pending for three to four months without valid reason. “There is no reason to keep NOCs pending for so long after uploading therequired documents online,” said Gupta. He said that the state government is committed to ensure that people get the benefit of various services in a transparent manner and within a stipulated time period. Such negligence in issuance of fire NOCs would not be tolerated, he warned. Gupta also directed the joint commissioner, MC, Sanyam Garg to prepare a detailed report about irregularities in issuance of NOCs and submit it at the earliest. Stern action would be taken against the guilty, he said. Gupta also warned officers of the fire station to improve their working and simplify the process of Fire NoC so that people did not have to make frequent rounds of the office. During two meetings held to discuss development in the city, Gupta had asked fire station officials to issue fire NoC to applicants on time. He had directed them to stop files only if they lacked proper documentation. Councillor Suresh Verma, assistant fire officer Mamraj Singh and LFM Neeraj were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/speaker-conducts-surprise-check-at-fire-stn-hauls-up-officials-for-laxity/articleshow/87118779.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The special Pocso court refused to grant the accused leniency and said touching and pressing the chest of a child is sufficient to establish the accused’s sexual intention. The accused in his defence claimed he was falsely implicated over a previous fight with the child’s uncle and also because she had demanded a complimentary ice-cream and when he told her it was unavailable, she continued to insist. “No prudent man can rely on a defence story that on the quarrel of the uncle, the victim lodged the false report against the accused and merely on refusal to give an ice-cream, a false report is lodged against him,” the court said. The child’s parents had complained to the police. The mother said on February 13, 2017, around 6.45pm, the girl had gone to the store to buy a frankie. Upon returning from the place, she looked frightened. Subsequently, she informed her mother that when she visited the shop, no customer was present. She demanded a frankie from an “unknown person” present in the shop. Instead of giving her the frankie, the person offered her an ice-cream and called her near him and touched her. The mother informed the child’s father and both went to the shop. The child identified the accused.

GFP MLAs Vijai Sardesai, Jayesh Salgaonkar and Vinod Paliencar also carried protest banners to highlight the surge in fuel prices and promised to reduce the petrol price in the state to Rs 80 per litre if GFP forms the government in 2022. “We have travelled from Margao to Panaji by an electric bus,” said Sardesai, adding, “We will bring a 20% reduction in the fuel prices and for this we have a robust plan.” The former deputy chief minister said that in view of the rising fuel prices, public transport in Goa needs to be made robust so that most of the public travel by bus. Stating that the high fuel prices are an indicator of the BJP government’s “double engine growth”, Sardesai said that the fuel prices have shot up because of the failure of the double engine regime. He said public is made to pay higher price to the extent that aviation fuel is 30% cheaper. The Fatorda MLA asked why the state government could not have reduced VAT to bring down the fuel rates. Since Goa police personnel and assembly marshalls attempted to stop the three lawmakers from entering the assembly premises with the banners, they sat in front of the entrance with the banners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-mlas-walk-to-assembly-promise-to-give-petrol-at-rs-80/articleshow/87121104.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Centre has recently announced that it would not procure paddy from the coming rabi season and the state government was trying to convince the Centre to change its decision as it would badly impact the state. The CM instructed the civil supplies department to procure paddy through 6,545 centres that were formed last year to procure paddy. He said farmers need not worry or feel anxious about paddy procurement in the state. The CM suggested to farmers to clean their paddy and ensure that it had no moisture and asked them to get dry paddy to the procurement centres. KCR said the government was taking all measures to procure paddy as per the minimum support price. He held a review meeting on paddy procurement at Pragathi Bhavan on Monday. Meanwhile, an extended meeting on podu land would be held on October 23 with the district collectors and senior forest department officials to resolve the issue and Haritha Haram programme.

---||Lucknow||BJP-backed SP rebel MLA Nitin Agarwal elected deputy speaker in Uttar Pradesh assembly||LUCKNOW: BJP-backed SP rebel MLA Nitin Agarwal trounced Samajwadi Party’s official candidate and Mahmudabad MLA Narendra Singh Verma in the election for deputy speaker in UP assembly on Monday. Nitin, the son of SP turncoat and former Rajya Sabha member Naresh Agarwal, polled 304 votes beating Verma who got only 60 votes in what turned out to be a one-sided contest, but with key political overtones. A total of 368 votes were polled, of which four were declared invalid even as the Congress and BSP had announced boycott of voting but some MLAs hobnobbing with the ruling party did cast their votes. BJP and its ally Apna Dal (Sone Lal) have a total strength of 313 in the assembly with BJP having 304 MLAs and the AD (S) nine in the house of 403. Lone MLA from RLD Sahendra Singh Ramala, who had joined the BJP, also voted with the saffron block. BSP MLA Anil Singh and Congress MLA Rakesh Singh have also been openly associating with BJP. Rebel Congress MLA Aditi Singh, who has been openly defying party stand and praised CM Yogi Adityanath in the past cast her vote. Likewise, Independent MLAs Aman Mani Tripathi and Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya have also been siding with BJP. Verma, on the other hand enjoyed the support of 48 out of 49 SP MLAs, besides a host of BSP rebels. They included two expelled BSP MLAs — Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar — besides rebel BSP MLAs Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel, Mujtaba Siddiqui and Hargovind Bhargav. The four MLAs of BJP’s ally-turned-political adversary Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party voted for Verma, party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar told TOI. In a strategic move, BSP staged a walkout and abstained from voting, staying away from both SP and BJP ahead of the UP assembly elections. Despite a one-sided win, BJP sources said the party would find out which MLAs cross-voted for SP. BJP’s Sitapur Sadar MLA Rakesh Rathore has turned rebel and had met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in September. Earlier in the day, Leader of the Opposition and SP MLA Ram Govind Chaudhary said the ruling party has scripted a ‘black chapter’ in the history of parliamentary traditions by fielding a candidate for the deputy speaker’s post. Traditionally, the ruling party accepts the Opposition’s candidate for the post and there has never been the need for voting, he said while demanding deferment of voting. The demand was, however, turned down by Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit who said the election process already got started with filing of nominations on Sunday. Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna slammed the Opposition for creating fuss on the issue since there has been no deputy speaker in the UP assembly since 2007 when BJP’s Rajesh Agarwal held the post. “They (the opposition) did not put up any candidate for the last four-and-half years and now, when we followed the tradition and ourselves fielded an SP MLA as candidate, the opposition is creating an unnecessary issue,” Khanna said. BJP’s move to field Nitin as deputy speaker is also being perceived as an attempt to firm up its ties with the trader community which has been traditionally voting for the saffron party. SP, on the other hand, fielded Verma, a Kurmi, in an apparent message to the OBC community ahead of the assembly polls due in the next few months. Significantly, Apna Dal (S) too was demanding that an OBC or Dalit candidate be fielded. Eventually, out of its nine MLA, seven voted for Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-backed-sp-rebel-mla-agarwal-elected-dy-speaker/articleshow/87123176.cms||Pankaj Shah

While the Nainital-Bhowali Road was blocked in the morning after landslides near Beerbhatti bridge, the Nainital-Haldwani Road and Nainital-Kaladhungi Road were also blocked by the evening. According to the district administration, many people travelling to and from Nainital were stranded for several hours on the routes. “ We are making efforts to supply food and relief material to those who have been stuck on the highway for a long time,” said Nainital sub-divisional magistrate Prateek Jain.

Hordes of tourists had reached Nainital over the Dussehra long weekend and many have been left stranded. Hoteliers TOI spoke to said tourists who were to check out on Monday have preferred to stay back while those leaving in the next few days are also wary of travelling in bad weather. The torrential rains also resulted in an abrupt rise in water level at the Naini Lake on Monday. “We had opened the lake gates around noon when the water level in the lake touched the 12 feet mark. But even though all the gates were open and 200 cusecs of water was being released from the lake every second, the level has now risen to 12 feet and six inches. We have alerted the senior officials about the situation and are waiting for the rains to stop so that the water level comes down,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-rains-nainital-cut-off-from-rest-of-state-as-landslides-block-all-3-highways-to-hill-town/articleshow/87116175.cms||Prashant Jha

This is nothing but fraud,” Doifode said. “I have asked the tehsildar (of Nashik) to find out about such people and register cases,” the resident deputy collector added. The matter came to light on Monday when an elderly woman from the Kalwan taluka approached an official at the district collectorate and presented him with the acknowledgement slip of an application filed by her. She wanted to know when the government aid would be transferred to her account as she had lost her son due to Covid. The official then approached Doifode with the papers and woman following which the order was issued. The administration has also displayed a temporary notice board at the entrance of the collectorate stating: “The government has not issued any guidelines on relief to the kin of Covid victims. The government will announce such help through proper orders, newspapers and media.

---||Jaipur||Kota Congress rival group’s poster war against mining minister||KOTA: A rival group in Kota has launched a poster war against mining minister Pramod Jain Bhaya after the party and the Congress government did not take any action against him despite repeated allegations of promoting the mining mafia. A full size flex banner on Kota-Baran NH-27 near Simliya toll plaza and Karadiya village criticises Bhaya without individually naming him for corruption. A bold red line in Hindi on the banner reads ‘Khaya re khaya - bhaya ne khaya’ and adds on ‘Bhata (stone) khaya – Bhaya ne khaya, raite khayi – Bhaya ne khayi, mitti khayi – Bhaya ne khayi.’ The banner sumps up with a dark blue horizontal border with a white bold line ‘Khaya re khaya – Bhaya ne khaya’. Simliya block Congress president Jaya Meena admitted to the media that they had erected the flex banner against Bhaya and in support of local MLA Bharat Singh, who had been raising voice against illegal mining. “We want to expose the working style of the mining minister and we have used the word ‘Bhaya’ for state mini ng minister Pramod Jain Bhaya’, Meena said. However, MLA Singh did not take any responsibility for the banner on Kota-Baran national highway. The slogans on the banner are the same raised against state mining minister by party workers at the party meeting in Gumanpura last week. “Bhaya is not a registered name to any individual, it is generalised name,” Singh said. Congress MLA from Sangod Bharat Singh Kundanpur has repeatedly attacked Bhaya for corruption in the mining department and operating the mining mafia. Singh has also shot several letters to chief minister Ashok Gehlot with the same allegations and demanded his removal. However, Bhaya has never come out with any statement against Bharat Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kota-cong-rival-groups-poster-war-against-mining-minister/articleshow/87121085.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Brace for more rains this week, says IMD||KOCHI: Though the state will get a respite from heavy rainfall for two days, a fresh spell of easterly waves is likely to impact Kerala further from Wednesday. The state received 44cm rainfall against a normal of 18cm from October 1 to 18, around 142% large excess. Meanwhile, there is a concern that the opening of Idukki and Idamalayar together on Tuesday could trigger inundation of low-lying areas of Periyar river banks. Similarly, the opening of Kakki and Pamba dams could trigger flooding in Kuttanad. “The authorities should look at the tidal chart before releasing the waters. The shutter opening time of Idukki and Idamalayar dam on Tuesday should be decided tomorrow considering the tidal waves in Kochi. On Tuesday, at 11.16am, the maximum high tide limit will be reduced to 0.86m and the minimum will be at 5.45pm. When the water from the dam reaches Kochi, it should be at least 3pm. Therefore, the opening time of the dams should take into account the time when the water reaches the Kochi lake. Otherwise, places like Paravur, Aluva, Kalamassery and Ernakulam will be flooded,” said C M Joy, president, Kerala nature protection council. Though the IMD warning is yellow alert from October 20 to 22, it is likely to turn orange with very heavy rainfall in south and central districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/brace-for-more-rains-this-week-says-imd/articleshow/87121155.cms||---

At least 1,200 tourists who were in the region for the long weekend were turned away, said Rahul, director of the reserve (who uses only his first name). “We will refund almost Rs 4 lakh to the tourists that the reserve earns through daily safari bookings,” said the director. He added that the decision to conduct safari on Tuesday would entirely depend upon weather conditions. Meanwhile, 30 tourists availing of the night stay facility at Bijrani and Jhirana zones were directed to stay indoors. The direction was issued as all the activities in the reserve have been suspended due to erratic weather and heavy rainfall. According to forest officials, there is a chance that animals in Bijrani, Dhela, Jhirna, Garzia and Pakhro zones of Corbett “may go wild as swollen rivers and swampy marshes have forced them to look for hide-outs in the reserve.” A tourist staying at a private lodge in Ramnagar told TOI, “Not getting entry into the reserve was a big disappointment for us as we had come from Delhi just to be in the lap of nature and undertake the wildlife safari. The other tourists were equally disappointed. We hope the weather clears up soon and the safaris resume,” said Anita Kumari, a resident of Green Park in Delhi. Every day, at least 200 safari tours are conducted by the Corbett administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-rains-corbett-safaris-cancelled-1200-tourists-turned-away/articleshow/87116211.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Mumbai||Theatres seek service charge on tickets, transporters eye tax sop||MUMBAI: A delegation each of transporters and theatre owners and film exhibitors met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday seeking concessions such as permission to levy a service charge on cinema tickets and exemption from taxes and licence fees to offset pandemic-induced losses in revenue. The meetings were attended by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. The transporters including bus, tempo, truck, tanker operators sought exemption from annual motor vehicle tax, waiver of motor tax on vehicles transporting to schools and religious places, and provisions for parking spaces across the state. They also demanded lifting of the 10 to 16-hour ban on entry of heavy vehicles in major cities and reduction of police powers to inspect public service vehicles. Thackeray said a solution will be worked out to address the crisis faced by them. He also directed the administration to ensure adequate parking spots of these vehicles and also said trauma centres will be set up at check posts. Maharashtra Rajya Truck Tempo Tankers Bus Vahatuk Mahasangh president Prasanna Patwardhan said: "We expect lot of relief measures from government as transporters and bus operators are facing huge difficulties due to Covid-19 pandemic and diesel inflation. We are glad that the CM agreed to set up trauma care and other facilities at 22 border check posts of Maharashtra. It will really help transporters in getting urgent medical care during serious mishaps on highways besides offering facilities for parking etc." Another delegation of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association demanded that the state provide concessions for renewal of licenses as well as free renewal of cinema licenses, and permission to levy a service charge of Rs 25 per ticket. It has also sought easing of restrictions on the occupancy limit, which has been set at 50% for each show. Cinema halls have been allowed to re-open in the state from October 22. "Unless full occupancy is allowed in halls, large budget movies will not be released as they will not be financially feasible then. The industry will not come to normalcy unless mega movies release and start doing pre-Covid business," said Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of Multiplex Association of India. Thackeray said appropriate solutions will be worked out in coordination with the finance department to address issues of single-screen cinema halls that are facing financial difficulties. He urged theatre owners to mandate safety checks, including on electric networks, before reopening for screenings.

Supervising land levelling and cleaning work, mayor Jeeti Sidhu said the move would keep stray animals away from city roads, reducing accidents. After fencing and construction of sheds, the land would be rented out to cattle owners of different villages under the Mohali MC, said the mayor. He added, “This is a major initiative, under which the municipal corporation has passed a resolution and sent it to the local government department. As soon as approval is received from the department, action will be initiated.” The site was located near the dumping ground in Mohali and was handed over to the MC by Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). The MC is of the view that all livestock of Mohali should be shifted by renting space to livestock owners. GMADA gave the land to the MC several years ago but for years the civic body did nothing on the ground. More than three acres of the 13-acre land is reserved for livestock. The mayor said some people were keeping cattle in villages under the Mohali MC, causing problems such as blocking of sewerage in villages and accidents. Therefore, the MC passed a resolution to rent out land to them outside the city. The mayor said rent would be decided by a committee constituted at the level of deputy commissioner. The mayor also announced that once the resolution was passed, the process would be expedited and sheds would be rented out to cattle owners. He said shifting of Mohali livestock to the area would be a great relief to villages under the MC and city residents and warned of stern action against those who did not send their cattle to the designated area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-starts-work-to-shift-1000-cattle-heads-to-dairy-farm/articleshow/87118917.cms||---
---||Nashik||DSLA: For minor disputes, approach mediation clinic||Nashik :Senior officials of the District Legal Service Authority (DSLA) have appealed to people to contact the the mediation clinic even for the minor disputes. The officials said that often, smaller disputes that are not resolved on time take a bigger and uglier shape. Therefore, the mediation clinic should be approached for its intervention and legal advice. The officials said that in the day-to-day life, people face many problems from other people. However, these problems are also not so serious that the court of law can be approached. In such cases, the police register a non-cognizable offence and at quite a few times the problems continue to be as they are. In such situations, a feeling of helplessness is experienced by the victims. At times these unresolved issues take a serious shape like causing hurt, murder or attempt to murder, etc. On this backdrop, on the directions of the Supreme Court, the District Legal Service Authority (DSLA) has started the mediation clinic, informed secretary of the mediation clinic Prasad Kulkarni. Complaints such as disputes between the landlord and tenant, disputes over borrowed money, disputes over alimony, senior citizens not being taken care of by their wards, are also taken up at the mediation clinic. This year, the mediation clinic received 62 such complaints and last year it had received 82 complaints. In the mediation clinic, both the parties are given a patient hearing and the legal way out of it is explained to the parties. The mediation clinic also has lawyers and more and more people should take advantage of the facility that has been provided for citizens, said Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dsla-for-minor-disputes-approach-mediation-clinic/articleshow/87118920.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Surat||Two die in Surat packaging unit fire||Surat: Two migrant workers died and 18 others suffered burns and breathing problems after a fire broke out in a six storey packaging unit in Vareli under the Kadodara GIDC early on Monday morning. More than 100 workers working in the Vivah Packaging were rescued by the fire officials during the operation that lasted for nearly six hours. Kadodara GIDC police have arrested three persons including two owners and a manager for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police said that while the bottom four floors of the building were used for packaging and for storing raw materials, the top two floors were used as accommodation for the workers of the unit. According to fire officials, the fire broke out in the ground or first floor of the building that also has two levels of basement. The exact reason for the fire is yet not known, they added. The two deceased were identified as Abdul Kadir Abdul Samad Bharvaliya (23) from Uttar Pradesh and Mohan Kripakant Ameri Jha (38) of Bihar. Fire officials said that Bharvaliya fell from the third floor and died while trying to escape using a long piece of cloth. Since the fire started on the lower floor it was not possible for workers to use the only staircase in the building. Jha got trapped in the basement and had suffered over 90% burns. He succumbed after being shifted to hospital. “The workers with minor burns and breathing problems were shifted to hospital for treatment. Except one, all affected persons were discharged by afternoon,” said a police officer. As many as 15 fire fighting vehicles, including one hydraulic platform and a turntable ladder were used to rescue the workers trapped on the top floor. Fire teams of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), Bardoli and Palsana Enviro Protection Ltd were put into service to control the fire that started around 4am. Based on a police complaint filed by Jha’s elder brother Basant, police arrested owners of Vivah Packaging— Janak Jogani and his brother Shailesh; and unit manager Dinesh Vaghasiya. “The accused have been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder considering negligence in fire safety,” said Usha Rada Desai, superintendent of police, Surat. They were booked under different sections of the Indian Penal Code including 336 (negligent act endangering human life), 337 (negligent act causing hurt to any person), 338 (negligent act causing grievous hurt to any person) and under Gujarat Factories Act Rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-die-in-surat-packaging-unit-fire/articleshow/87118951.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Serial offender drugs elderly woman, but alert autorickshaw driver ends run||NEW DELHI: An elderly woman was given sedatives and taken in an auto by a serial offender who has allegedly been drugging and looting people for two decades. However, he ran out of luck this time as the suspicious auto driver, who saw the man removing the woman’s bangles through the rear view mirror, stopped the vehicle after spotting police near Azadpur Metro Station. Gurmeet Singh (55), a resident of Sector 44A in Chandigarh, was first arrested in a similar case in 2002.  The elderly woman, who has been hospitalised, was unconscious till Monday as she was administered a heavy dose of Alprax. DCP (northwest) Usha Rangnani said the driver would be rewarded. “Police have recovered a mobile phone, cash and gold ornaments of the victim. The accused is a habitual criminal who was previously involved in similar cases,” Rangnani said. Singh hired the auto from Burari on Sunday for going towards Model Town. The driver, Titu, found the activities of the man suspicious as he saw the accused removing the bangles and trying to take out her ring and purse. But Titu remained calm and stopped the auto near gate no. 3 of Azadpur Metro Station where police personnel were present. Singh tried to flee, but, prompted by Titu, police caught him. Singh allegedly said he used to offer cold drinks mixed with Alprax tablets to his targets and steal their valuables. An FIR was registered at the Model Town police station and Singh was arrested. In 2002, Singh was arrested in Mangolpuri, and a year later, in Janakpuri for similar incidents. In 2014, he drugged and robbed a person in the Parliament Street police station area. Police are trying to determine the number of cases Singh was involved in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/serial-offender-drugs-elderly-woman-but-alert-autorickshaw-driver-ends-run/articleshow/87121163.cms||---

The raid was conducted under the department’s district-wide campaign, Shudh Ke Liye Yudh, which was launched on October 14 to keep a tab on the quality of edibles. Chief medical health officer Dr BL Vishnoi said on Saturday, their team led by food safety officer Bhuraram Godara reached Goyal Transport Company and found many packets of Shaswat brand ghee. A total of 1,060kg ghee worth Rs 5,93,600 was found in 8 cartons containing 200ml bottles, 32 cartons of 500ml bottles, 24 cartons of 1 litre containers and five cartons with containers of 5 litres, he said. He said the consignment was seized after sample collection. Vishnoi said the recovered ghee was expired, but there were full chances of adulteration. The transport company owner told the team that ghee was for M/s Dharamraj Agency at City Centre in Barmer. The transport company owner Suresh loaded the consignment in a vehicle and sent it to the residence of Dharamraj Agency owner Jitendra Sindhi, but he was not at home and had switched off his mobile phone. On being informed, Kotwali police reached the spot and took away the ghee. Godara said that the team questioned transport company owner and Ram Kumar Bansal, business partner of Sindhi, who agreed to call Sindhi to the spot. Later Sindhi took the health department officials to his godown, he said. The officials collected samples and sent them the laboratory after seizing the edibles. Once the test reports arrive, further legal action will be taken, said Godara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-recovers-1060kg-expired-ghee-in-barmer/articleshow/87121164.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Man drowns at Kallar, one rescued||Thiruvananthapuram: Disregarding warnings of the disaster management authority proved too costly for a city resident who stepped into the Kallar river during the perilous weather as he was swept away by the strong current. Abhilash, 24, of Kaimanam in the city is the deceased. His friend, Sujith, who was also swept away by the currents, was saved by a local resident. According to Vithura police, the mishap occurred around 5.30 pm on Sunday at the check dam at Nellimukku near Kallar. Abhilash was part of a four-member group that reached the spot in the evening. The others were his mother, Kala, relative Soumya and friend, Sujith. While Abhilash and Sujith stepped into the river, the women chose to stay back on the bank. The two men were swept away by the strong currents of the river. Sujith managed to grab hold of the root of a tree and stayed afloat till a local resident came to his rescue. Abhilash was found 500 meters away with injuries on his head. The police assume that the death was caused not by drowning, but by being smashed against the rocks that were abundant in the river as there was not enough depth in the river in this region for drowning. Just over 24 hours ago, a guest labourer from Jharkhand had gone missing while swimming in Amayizhanchan canal near Kannammoola in the city during heavy rains. The search for him ended without success on Sunday too. The scuba diving experts of the fire department conducted a search up to two kms downstream. Ministers V Sivankutty and G R Anil visited the spot and monitored the search operations. They also extended all possible help and support to the family of the 30-year-old missing labourer Nagardeep Kumar Mondal. Following the heavy rains that lashed the district during the weekend, as many as 516 persons were forced to move out of their homes as low lying regions continued to be inundated with flood water. A total of 14 relief camps have been opened. Neyyattinkara taluk has the most number of camps. As many as six relief camps were opened here in which 125 members of 45 families are sheltered. Thiruvananthapuram taluk was most affected with 312 members of 78 families forced to move into relief camps. As many as five camps were opened in Thiruvananthapuram taluk. Chirayinkeezhu taluk has three camps in which 79 members of 25 families are sheltered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-drowns-at-kallar-one-rescued/articleshow/87090983.cms||---

Even a month after UAE allowed expatriates to return to the place of work, airfares are not showing any signs of relenting. For the next 75 days, fares are 150% higher one way for a layover flight and in excess of Rs 200% for a direct flight from all airports in India to Dubai and Sharjah, the main ports of entry into the UAE. Earlier the Dubai – Mangaluru fares were showing this trend of higher prices as expatriates used to return home for the holiday season. Those fares are now half of what they used to be with none of the expatriates taking a risk to visit India due to the volatile pandemic situation. But that trend is also changing with airlines booking full flights and the Dubai-India fares are also on the rise. An airline source told TOI airfares will not go back to pre-pandemic levels in the near future or for at least the coming three months. “The airlines have suffered the worst and are trying to make good their losses by keeping fares at twice that of pre-pandemic levels,” the source added. Consider this, a Mangaluru-Dubai fare during the pre-pandemic lean months of November till December first week used to be sub-Rs 10,000. Now it is in the range of Rs 21,000 to 25,000, 250% till travel up to January 9. A trip to Dubai from Bengaluru is also not cheap and fares are above Rs 20,000 till January 10. From Mumbai to Dubai, it is in excess of Rs 17,000. Even from New Delhi it is above Rs 10,000 - Rs 12,000. All these lower fares are for layover flights and direct flights cost a few thousands more. If a passenger from this region wants a cheaper fare from other airports, it would entail the hardship of additional travel costs plus calculations of getting inside the RT-PCR deadline of 48 hours as mandated by the UAE government. The return trip from Dubai to India, though not as pricey as it was before the pandemic, if not booked well in advance, also tends to go through the roof as the travel dates get nearer. Even with the high fares, all flights from Mangaluru to Dubai are going full and return flights have 90% passenger load.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/air-fares-to-dubai-pinch-travellers-as-airlines-cash-in-on-return-rush/articleshow/87116516.cms||Stanley Pinto

The residents of around 15 houses are yet to come to terms with the tragedy which took away four amongst them. Besides a shop, one house was completely washed away and there was partial damage to another house. Those who lost their houses are staying in the houses of relatives downhill at night, and during the day they return to Plappally to take care of their cattle and other livelihood means. The funeral of Roshini and Sonia was held on Monday. The funeral of Sarasamma, wife of Mohan, who ran a grocery-cum-tea shop here, will be held on Tuesday. There is still no word on the body of Alan, a 14-year-old boy, who had gone missing in the tragedy. Rejimon K M, a Plappally resident, said that they are not in a mindset to start planning about returning to normal life. “It may take weeks for the resumption of power supply. The transformer in the region was also washed away in the landslide,” said Rejimon, who works as the section officer in the PSC in Thiruvananthapuram. He had come home for Puja holidays. “There are around 30 children in the area and the lack of power supply will affect their online classes,” he added. Rejimon said that this year alone, the region experienced around 20 big and small landslides and mudslips. He said that attempts were made to start a quarry atop the hill above Kavali last year. A road was also built to the proposed site, he added. However, the project was stalled after a landslide in that region. Besides power supply, the residents here are looking for better road connectivity too at the earliest. “Roads were cleared on Monday so that jeeps can travel up to our place,” Rejimon said. The residents here have to travel 4.5km to reach Koottickal to take a bus. They can also reach Enthayar town by walking 3km. Since the only shop in the region was washed away, the residents have to travel to Koottickal or Enthayar to buy things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/power-outage-no-roads-its-a-long-way-to-normalcy-here/articleshow/87121224.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The Mahavitaran had initiated the action of disconnecting power supply to certain villages as they have dues of over Rs30 crore. The power utility said the gram panchayats recover water and property tax charges from the villagers and so they should not have any problem in paying the pending bills. However, the gram panchayats maintained that they do not charge any tax for infrastructure set up by Mahavitaran, such as offices and sub-stations in the villages. Raju Magdum, the sarpanch of Mangaon village, said, “We have moved a petition against the Mahavitaran in the Bombay HC to allow the gram panchayats to charge property tax for the infrastructure developed by Mahavitaran. Mahavitaran should pay the tax to us as we use power for public purposes and not to make profits.” Several local leaders and members of Kolhapur Zilla Parishad were present outside the Mahavitaran’s office to show support for the strike. Mahavitaran officials invited the delegation of sarpanchs to discuss the issue. The sarpanchs claimed that since the state government is going to clear gram panchayats’ dues, Mahavitaran should restore power supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-sarpanchs-stir-against-power-supply-cuts/articleshow/87119010.cms||---

The fire that started on lower floors in the six storey building that has two basements and gradually spread in the upper floors where the workers lived in 15 rooms.In May 2019, fire in Takshashila Arcade in Sarthana had killed 22 people, mostly students. Many students of the architecture institute on an unauthorised fourth floor had jumped to the ground to save themselves from fire and smoke. The building of Vivah Packaging was registered as a residential building and not a factory and police will investigate if it has some illegal construction. “There was no other route to get out except the main staircase and goods were stored on the stairs as well. These goods also caught fire due to which it was blocked,” said Usha Rada Desai, district superintendent of police, Surat. Surat Municipal Corporation’s firefighting team of 125 men reached the spot with a firefighter, one hydraulic platform and a turntable ladder. Both the rescue machines rescued over 100 people from upper floor galleries and terrace. The machines can rescue people from upto 55 m height. “Highly inflammable textile and plastic material was stored on all floors except two upper floors that were used as residence for workers.

Cabral, who was replying to a calling attention raised by Ponda MLA Ravi Naik in the assembly, said that the power lines in Ponda taluka, which were laid about 40 years ago have outlived their service life and the electricity department has moved to replace the low-tension power lines and lay high tension underground power cables. “We are doing underground cabling, we have put up seven sub-stations and we will sincerely work to give 24x7 power supply,” said Cabral. Legislators Ramakrishna Dhavalikar and Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco also spoke about the frequent power fluctuations.

The mock protest was a re-enactment of ‘Chandrika homam’ staged by the UDF councillors back in 2014 when they came up with various modes of protest to express their dissent against the then Mayor K Chandrika. On Sunday, the UDF councillors came prepared with all essential items for the ritual and even had a priest. They also chanted mockingly and prayed that corruption may be wiped off from the city corporation. In 2014, Hindu Aikyavedi had filed complaints against the UDF councillors for profaning the rituals. The councillors had then followed it up with an all religion prayer in the main office when Hindu religious organisations strongly objected to the mock ritual they had conducted. Meanwhile, Mayor Arya Rajendran was soon to give the protest a communal shade and issued a press note in which she said that such mode of protests aimed to rattle the secular nature of the local self-government institutions. “Corporation is a secular institution and gives equal consideration to all sects and religions,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/udf-conducts-ritual-to-exorcise-graft-from-corp/articleshow/87091064.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh firm develops non-lethal weapons apt for use in Galwan-like clash||LUCKNOW: A Noida-based firm has developed non-lethal weapons for security forces inspired from traditional Indian weapons used in man-to-man combat. According to the chief technology officer (CTO) of Apastron, Mohit Kumar, the need for such weapons was felt after Chinese soldiers used wired sticks and tasers against soldiers during the Galwan clash. Kumar told TOI that the need for non-lethal weapons for the Indian Army arose after 20 jawans were martyred in June 2020 in an attack by the People’s Liberation Army of China at LAC’s Galwan Valley. “We have collaborated with the College of Military Engineering to manufacture non-lethal weapons. Such weapons manufactured include ‘Vajra’, ‘Trishul’, ‘Sapper Punch’ ‘Dand V1’ and ‘Dand V2’,” he said. A consignment has been delivered to the army, and other units like Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) are mulling to buy such weapons. “We are also about to get orders from units in eastern command,” said Kumar. Explaining the utility of non-lethal weapons, Kumar said that ‘Vajra’, is a metal taser with spikes used for both tasing and hand-to-hand combat. It can also puncture bullet-proof vehicles. ‘Trishul’ can be used for tasing as well as blocking vehicles. Another tasing equipment called ‘Sapper Punch’, is to be worn like protective gloves and can be used to give a blow with current. ‘Dand V1’ and ‘Dand V2’ are types of ‘lathis’ which can be used as taser equipment and are vital in law and order situations. They are made of polycarbonate material. Similarly, light weight ‘Bhadra’ is a shield used as protective gear. “None of these non-lethal weapons will cause death or serious injury,” said Kumar. The private company is owned by Abhishek Singh and also deals in manufacturing of light-weight bullet-proof jackets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-firms-non-lethal-weapons-apt-for-use-in-galwan-like-clash/articleshow/87123331.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

He was speaking during a ceremony organised to flag off a 723-km cycle rally from the Raithanwala border outpost on Sunday. The rally, organised to mark 75 years of independence and the National Unity Day, will conclude on October 26 at Kevadia in Gujarat. Several distinguished people attended the ceremony. Jamwal said terrorists were being sent to the Jammu and Kashmir border from Pakistan border through tunnels, while weapons and drugs were being sent through drones, adding that narcotics were also being sent from the Rajasthan border. He said the locals had a very important role to play in keeping the borders safe by remaining vigilant. The additional director general also took stock of the security arrangements. Deputy inspector general Anand Singh Takshak briefed Jamwal about the area. He also inaugurated a women’s Barrack in Raithanwala and planted trees. It was Jamwal’s first visit after taking charge of the Western Command. On Sunday minister of state for agriculture and farmers' welfare, Kailash Choudhary, who was also present during the ceremony, seconded Jamwal and lauded the efforts of the BSF and all paramilitary forces in keeping the borders safe in all extreme weather conditions. The BSF jawans will apprise people of the contribution of freedom fighters in India’s freedom movement and various government schemes during the rally. The cycle rally members will take part in the National Unity Day programme on October 31 at Kevadia, wherein PM Narendra Modi will be present. Kevadia houses the world's tallest statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, which is called the Statue of Unity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/support-bsf-to-check-cross-border-terrorism-top-official-tells-locals/articleshow/87121210.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Mother to the rescue of kid suffering from bone ailment||NEW DELHI: A 12-year-old girl suffering from chronic osteomyelitis, a rare-but-serious infection of the bone, recently underwent surgery in which the infected bone was removed and replaced with a new bone graft taken from her mother. The girl’s mother donated 15cm from her calf bone, doctors at Aakash Healthcare, where the surgery was carried out in two stages, said. Dr Aashish Chaudhry, director of orthopaedics, joint replacement and spine surgery at the hospital, said chronic osteomyelitis affected about two out of every 10,000 people. “If left untreated, it can become chronic and cause sepsis, necrosis (loss of blood supply) to the affected bone and bone tissue death by disrupting the flow of blood to the affected area, which could be life-threatening,” he said. In this case, Dr Chaudhry added, an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the femur was a definitive procedure that facilitates early mobilisation and reduces the risk of further infection — other conservative treatment would have required intensive medical care and prolonged bed rest. The patient’s mother was the best donor as she was the closest relative with minimal chances of histogenetic incompatibility, which could lead to complications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mother-to-the-rescue-of-kid-suffering-from-bone-ailment/articleshow/87121223.cms||---

---||Chennai||Iruvar: How a shared passion parted two men||Two score and nine years ago, on this epochal day, matinee idol and DMK’s third leader and party treasurer, M G Ramachandran (MGR) announced the formation of the Anna DMK. Four days earlier, MGR had been thrown out by the DMK. His sin: On October 8, 1972, he had publicly called out the DMK when he demanded that ministers, legislators and party functionaries from top-down account for their income and assets and those of their families. Chief minister, party president, and 27-year-long friend Karunanidhi’s new moniker for MGR, whom he had once christened Puratchi Nadigar, was "Judas", a "tax evader" and "quisling". MGR responded in kind by dubbing him an "evil force." A DMK propaganda song that once had celebrated MGR as ‘our son,’ now sang a different refrain: Our pet ‘ram’, rammed our heart; And fell flat to traitors’ plot. A euphemism that suggested MGR had fallen prey to the machinations of Congress-I. In their better days, only a year earlier, Karunanidhi had eulogised MGR as "an invincible hero before and after," and wished for his fame alongside the South, so that "The hearts of those like me who had risen because of you, exult!" In 1970, MGR had seen Karunanidhi as "Another Anna." What had gone amiss? In 1946, Rajakumari had brought the dashing hero and the gifted scriptwriter together. Its success saw a spate of movies such as Abhimanyu, Marudhanaatu Ilavarasi, Mandhirikumari, Naam, Malaikallan, Kanchithalaivan, Engal Thangam, Pudhumaipithan and Arasilangkumari and some others to great acclaim. Thanks to Karunanidhi, MGR, a Congressman, was won over to the DMK. Unable to compete with the formidable duo, E V K Sampath and his followers exited the DMK in 1961. In 1969, Karunanidhi succeeded Anna as chief minister and party leader, courtesy MGR. MGR had been made treasurer. Karunanidhi had become Kalaignar and Thalaivar. He wished to be his own man, but the masses went into raptures for one man like no other: MGR. The scriptwriter, therefore, chose to craft a different script for his hero now. As each dealt slights to the other, matters soon came to a head. By expelling MGR, Karunanidhi had unwittingly repaid his debt to his friend in full: forcing MGR the caterpillar to metamorphose into a butterfly; turning him from an actor-politician to a political leader. MGR was no more his Puratchi Nadigar. He had catapulted him to Puratchi Thalaivar. The next 15 years saw the two accuse each other of villainy and venality. MGR’s charges led to the Sarkaria Commission denting Karunanidhi’s image. As chief minister, MGR itched to slap criminal charges using the commission’s findings. Day in and day out, Karunanidhi derided MGR as a ‘buffoon’ and alleged he was on the take. The Ray Commission and the dismissal of MGR’s government followed – thanks to Karunanidhi’s renewed ties with Indira Gandhi. Yet, the first 27 years of their friendship proved stronger, resilient, and sometimes tender. Ambitious, both shared a past of singular struggle. In their do-or-die early years, their mothers treated the other child as their own; the bond was so thick that they sometimes ate from the same plate. During their humble beginnings, they had lived under the same roof and had shared joys and sorrows. Each, therefore, had a grudging respect for the other, often leaving their followers confounded. They smiled at each other, engaged in reunification talks, showed up holding hands at Tamilisai’s wedding (now governor) where MGR exhorted the couple to learn from their friendship. And what a friendship it was: MGR would send Karunanidhi an ambulance even as he led a long march against him. Karunanidhi would advise Duraimurugan to ‘propose or second’ MGR’s candidacy for a honoris causa doctorate. An atheist he would ‘supplicate’ when his friend fell seriously ill. In the 1984 elections, Karunanidhi said he would step down if elected and turn over the government to his friend being treated in the US even as he seriously questioned MGR’s recovery and his ability to govern. A triumphant MGR abolished the Legislative Council to pre-empt Karunanidhi becoming the Leader of the Opposition. Yet, in the early hours of Christmas eve, on December 24, 1987, a sorrowful Karunanidhi repaired to Ramavaram to pay his final respects to his most charismatic friend, MGR. A moving eulogy befitting their deep friendship followed even as DMK flags flew at half-mast to mark their unsevered bond.

The woman was presented before a court and was sent to 14-day judicial custody. Her two children — aged 7 years and 1.5 years — have been sent to a government observation home. “The deceased has been identified as Naresh Kumar (35), a native of Jharkhand, who had come to Kudashi around 10 years ago along with his wife Surekha,” said assistant police inspector Sachin Salunke of the Pimpalner police station where the case of murder has been registered. “Kumar worked as a mason at construction sites.

---||Mumbai||Only 7% breakthrough Covid cases in 9 months, mostly not severe: BMC data||MUMBAI: In the nine months since mass vaccination started in Mumbai, roughly 28,000 people got Covid despite being fully or partially vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to data maintained by the civic health department. “These 28,000 people account for only 7% of all the Covid-19 cases that occurred in the city between February 1 and October 17,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “This can also be interpreted as 93% of those who got infected hadn’t taken the vaccine at all,” she said. Between February 1 and October 17, the city registered over 4.6 lakh Covid cases due to the second wave caused by the highly transmissible Delta strain. When a person gets infected despite vaccination, it’s called breakthrough infection. The BMC’s public health team isn’t too worried about the breakthrough numbers for two reasons: the numbers are low, and a majority of these 28,000 patients didn’t suffer from severe Covid. The BMC collates information about breakthrough infections through its ward-level Covid war rooms: they get information about every positive patient and a local official calls up the patient for medical details, including his/her vaccination status. The latest data sheet from BMC shows that 16,029 people who had taken the first shot got Covid. “This accounts for 0.43% of all those who have taken the first vaccine,” said Gomare. Of those who have taken both the doses, 0.26% got breakthrough infections, accounting for 2 cases in every 1,000 fully vaccinated individuals. With 97% of its 92.3 lakh adult population having taken one shot, Mumbai has one of the highest first dose coverages in the country. Breakthrough infections have been noted across the world, and while it was initially a cause for worry, doctors have realised that these infections are milder than those suffered by unvaccinated people. The BMC on Sunday released data of its third genetic sequencing that clearly showed that unvaccinated people had more severe disease and even faced death in comparison to vaccinated patients. Of the 343 Covid-positive samples studied, 121 patients were not vaccinated. Of them, 57 needed hospitalisation, including ICU, and three died. Another 168 were fully vaccinated and 46 of them needed hospitalisation. Of the 54 who had taken a single vaccine shot, only seven needed hospitalisation. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the vaccinated people had mild infection, less hospitalisation and no mortality. The third gene sequencing survey showed the Covid pandemic is now under control due to vaccination, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-7-breakthrough-covid-cases-in-9-mths-mostly-not-severe-bmc-data/articleshow/87121280.cms||Malathy Iyer

Recently, National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the administration and the municipal corporation (MC) to carry out the job. The directions were issued during the recent hearing through videoconferencing. The officials apprised the NGT panel that they have re-started the process to construct a new STP at Kishangarh. Initially, the work was to be completed by Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL). It had even floated a tender but failed. Recently, the work was given to the UT engineering department. It has now floated a fresh tender. The STP would not only solve the problem of sewage entering the Sukhna forest area, the treated water would also fill the lake. The new STP would fulfil latest norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and have 2 MLD capacity. Effluent from the STP at Kishangarh would be used for filling up of Sukhna during dry weather and latest membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology would be used for producing effluent of very high quality. Besides the STP at Kishangarh, the administration has also decided to spend Rs 808 crore on the upgradation of five sewage treatment plants. A senior official said these STPs would meet all norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The agency which would be allotted the work would also have to maintain these STPs for 10 years, he added. In August 2018, taking suo motu cognizance of media reports on pollution in the Ghaggar, the NGT had directed the chief secretaries of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh to constitute a special task force (STF) to clean the river. The NGT committee in Chandigarh, along with officials of Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), had visited various points of Sukhna choe in Chandigarh and had observed the level of pollution there. BOD level high in 2 STPs The functioning of STPs has not improved. The CPCC had detected shortcomings in the functioning of two of six sewage treatment plants (STPs) The two plants are releasing treated water with much higher bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) than the permissible level of the maximum 30 mg/litre The latest report was compiled by CPCC on directions of National Green Tribunal, which has been keeping an eye on water pollution in the city The STPs situated in Raipur Kalan, 3BRD, Maloya and Diggian are managed by the engineering department of the MC, while the engineering department of the administration maintains the STPs in Raipur Khurd and Dhanas||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/upgradation-of-all-stps-by-end-of-2022-environment-panel/articleshow/87119116.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The accused even got the fake rubber stamps of police commissioner, IPS and IAS officers to dupe people. The accused Kaluram alias Rahul Shekhawat (25) conned people in a fashion reminiscent of Hindi films. “The accused started purchasing grocery from National Kirana store situated at Jhotwara three months ago as a regular customer. In his every visit, he was paying for the things he had purchased to win the trust of the wholesale dealer. However, as per his plan he came a few days ago with a letter with the fake stamp of superintendent of police and was in police uniform,” said Richa Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (west). “He told the grocery store owner, the complainant in the case, that he got a job as police inspector and is presently posted as inspector at the Rajasthan police lines situated at Chandpol. He told the store owner that he needs grocery for the mess of the police lines where more than 5,000 police jawans eat everyday and gave him a written letter with fake signs of SP and other senior officers, asking the store owner to provide him grocery items worth Rs 10 lakh,” Tomar added. The accused promised that the payment for the items would be made through cheque three days after the delivery, she added. The store owner initially believed him but thought that in Jaipur, which has commissionerate system, why was the seal of the senior officer of SP, which is a rank. “He first enquired about the accused from the police officers he personally knew. Finally, after suspecting a fraud, he intimated us. Thus, as per the plan, we asked him to say a yes to the delivery of the grocery items worth Rs 10 lakh. As the accused came to get the delivery, he was arrested,” the DCP (west) added. The police have found fake rubber stamps of excise inspector, IB inspector, police inspector, additional director general, ACB, secretary Raj Bhawan and many others from the possession of the accused. “It was found that the accused had carried out similar frauds in Kapurthala of Punjab, Sriganganagar, Hisar of Haryana and other parts of Rajasthan, by preparing fake letters of senior police and excise officers,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/inter-state-conman-poses-as-cop-to-dupe-grocery-dealer-held/articleshow/87121290.cms||---

Meanwhile, respite in the rainfall has given some relief to the people of the area as the water level in Chalakkudy river reached only 4.75m in the afternoon whereas the warning level was 7.1m. The level of discharge of water from Parambikkulam has been reduced to 4,000 cusecs in the afternoon from 6,000 cusecs in the morning, said Suresh, the KSEB assistant executive engineer in-charge of the Poringalkuthu dam. One of the shutters of Sholayar dam was raised by one foot in the morning. The authorities have warned that water level in Chalakudy river will shoot up first in areas like Athirappilli, Meloor, Pariyaram, Karukutty, Annamanada, Kuzhoor, and Poyya areas. District collector Haritha V Kumar said people in the low-lying areas must be ready to relocate. Water levels in Peechi and Chimony dams are also increasing fast, aggravating the flood threat downstreams of Manali, Karuvannnur and Kurumali rivers. Twenty-two relief camps have been made operational in the district and 138 families have been housed there. At least two people have lost their lives in rain related incidents in the last two days in the district. A toddy shop worker, Kulathingal Sudarshan, 42, was found dead in a canal near Mala on Monday while the body of a retired school teacher, Embrampurath Joseph, 72, was found at Kundukad.

While rural colleges under Mumbai University’s jurisdiction had held classes for a bit in February, this is the first time BMC has given its nod to restart classes in colleges after they shut on March 17 last year. Most colleges plan to start classes and practicals for PG students from Wednesday. In a letter to MU, additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide approved the reopening of classes with 50% capacity. Only fully vaccinated students can be called back to campus, but the rule won’t apply to those under 18. BMC to facilitate special vax camps for students on college premisesThe BMC directed Mumbai University and its affiliated colleges to follow all Covid precaution when they restart physical classes from Wednesday. In case of unvaccinated students, the the college principal should contact the nearest ward office for a special camp on college premises. In its resolution on re-opening college campuses last week, the state government had recommended an attendance of 50% or more based on the Covid situation in particular regions. The BMC has chosen the safest option of half attendance. Many colleges started practicals for junior college students early this month and, therefore, are hoping to start degree colleges in phases too. With exams underway for undergraduate (second and third year) students, they are planning to call their postgraduate students first. After a survey, N M College in Vile Parle found 45% of its senior college students are vaccinated. “We are currently calling only first year UG and all PG students. From our side, we will be allowing only fully vaccinated students. We have to wait and see how the turnout will be,” said principal Parag Ajgaonkar. St Xavier’s College will be calling their postgraduate students from Wednesday. The MSc students will be called for practicals and the MA batch for lectures, said principal Rajendra Shinde. Since the university had announced online semester-end exams, there is no point in conducting those from college campuses, said another principal. A suburban college principal said more than 80% of their non-teaching staff from laboratories is on election duty and they may find it difficult to conduct practicals with limited staff. MU registrar Sudhir Puranik said colleges were concerned about students’ vaccination, but the BMC has directed them to hold special drives on campus. “A circular will be issued on physical classes for university departments too. A list of SOPs has been sent to all colleges,” he said. Most of the department students are from outside the city and without hostels, the attendance could be poor. But we intend to start our batches in blended mode, he added. The government has directed the higher education director to release guidelines for re-opening hostels in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-facilitate-special-vax-camps-for-students-on-college-premises/articleshow/87121325.cms||Yogita Rao

The last day saw 400 immersions in the Hooghly river. According to a KMC parks and squares department official, had rain not delayed the immersions, the entire process would have ended on Sunday. However, inclement weather prevented the community Puja organisers from carrying out the immersions at the ghats along the Hooghly river. Only 600 community Puja organisers turned up for the immersions on Sunday. “We expected at least 300 Puja organisers to turn up by midnight. But rain played spoilsport,” said a civic official on duty at Baje Kadamtala ghat. “We had a foolproof arrangement for the community Pujas at the major ghats and expected the process would come to an end on Sunday. But, consistent rain spoiled all plans. We were ready with arrangements on Monday too,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/400-immersions-in-hooghly-on-last-day/articleshow/87119175.cms||Saikat Ray

The average wholesale price was recorded at Rs 3,100 per quintal on Monday as against Rs 3,700 per quintal on October 12. According to traders, the demand for onions in some states have dropped due to Navaratra but it may pick up again over the next few days. “The demand for onions in states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Assam has reduced drastically during the last week due to Navratra festival,” Manoj Jain, an onion trader, said. “Many people fast during this time and do not eat onions. This is the reason why demand for onions has reduced during the last few days. Now that the Navratra festival is over, we are expecting rise in demand for onions. The average wholesale price of onions may also increase during the next fortnight,” he added. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 900 and Rs 3,660 per quintal, respectively. Around 7,300 quintal of onions was auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday. Currently, the onions arriving in the markets are summer produce harvested in March and April. The summer onions have a shelf life of six-seven months and are stored by the farmers for selling when the prices go up. There is no fresh crop until the arrival of fresh kharif onions that begins from mid-October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/average-wholesale-onion-price-falls-16-at-lasalgaon-in-a-week/articleshow/87114576.cms||Tushar Pawar

The directions were issued during a visit of the adviser on Thursday evening. He stressed on examining the proposal of setting up of the museum and heritage furniture museum and fast-track the work. He further directed the officials to dispose of the unwanted materials and equipment at the earliest. The administration and Indian Air Force (IAF) had recently signed an agreed in principle (AIP) for setting up of the centre, the first such in the country. The Air Force Heritage Centre would be an iconic place which will attract tourists from within India and abroad and be one of the most educative and informative centres for people, according to the UT. The IAF will showcase its vintage aircraft, armaments and memorabilia and other IAF artefacts, including audio video displays. The centre will also include a simulator where in the public can experience the flying of IAF aircraft. This will also act as the platform to motivate and facilitate youth to join the force, as this will resultantly provide not only employment opportunities but also strengthen the force and further reinforce national integration, according to the UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/examine-layout-plan-for-iaf-heritage-centre-adviser/articleshow/87119163.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

It is suspected that their mother may have been poached as a leopardess never moves away from her cubs.Locals who first noticed the cubs had handled them and clicked videos and photos.Talking to TOI, Gadchiroli conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar said, “The cubs were found on October 14, and for three days we had made all attempts to reunite them with the mother, but to no avail.”Mankar ruled out the possibility of the leopardess having been poached. “People have heard growling of the animal and we suspect it to be very much there.” However, not a single picture has been recorded in the camera traps deployed in the area, he said, adding after the failed attempts, we decided to hand over the cubs to the rescue centre. “On October 1, a male leopard was trapped in a cage from the paper mill area and sent to Gorewada. The leopard is said to have a conflict history. The animal had injured four persons and killed an 8-year-old boy last month, besides lifting goats,” said Mankar.Sources said, “Considering the flared up conflict near the paper mill area, the idea was to trap the mother leopard and then send the entire family to Gorewada. Even now attempts are being made to trap the leopardess.”“If there is no conflict after the male leopard has been captured, why the female is being trapped. This means, the forest department is not sure which leopard is the problem animal,” said locals NGOs.Meanwhile, Gorewada divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai said, “The cubs are stressed and are not in a good condition. However, they are responding to goat milk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopardess-missing-2-cubs-shifted-to-gorewada/articleshow/87116507.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported the lowest single-day case count in 17 months. The daily Covid chart, however, showed four deaths and 371 cases in Mumbai on Monday. For the second time in three days, the state caseload was at a 17-month low at 1,485, and reported 27 deaths. In Mumbai, the weekly caseload was 2,903 on September 20-26, but it rose to 3,224 in the October 4-10 week. Cases in Mumbai had dropped to 195 (August 16), when restrictions on local trains was eased, but started rising 15 days thereafter. In the October 11-17 week, the number of cases dropped to 2,842. Some doctors felt the October 11-17 week drop coincided with the Navratri festival when people were reluctant to get tested, but BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said it reflected the overall drop in infection rate across the state. “Hospitalisation rate is going down across the city. Most patients are stable enough to be treated at home. Our jumbo facilities, which would be filled to capacity during the peak months, barely have 5% to 10% occupancy now,” Kakani said. The only blip in the graph is the slight increase in the number of critical patients. From 308 critical patients between October 4-10, it’s 336 a week later. However, BMC officials said the critical patients are nowhere near the 10-time the figure it was in April-May period. With the drop in testing due to the weekend, Maharashtra reported 1,485 cases, a 17-month low Covid tally on Monday, lowest since May 12, 2020 when 1,026 cases were recorded. However, the tests conducted by the state also fell below one lakh for the first time since March 15 this year. Maharashtra conducted 95,890 in the last 24 hours, which is much lower than the average state of 1.3 lakh conducted during weekdays. Officials said the long festive weekend had led to the drop in testing. Maharashtra for the fourth day in a row reported under 30 deaths. The 11 districts of Vidarbha region together reported only three new cases, which is the lowest tally in both the waves. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the administration to ensure th-at people do not drop their guard as the cases are dipping and has asked for awareness campaigns to be ramped up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-citys-wkly-tally-dips-maha-case-count-at-17-month-low/articleshow/87125551.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High fuel rates, festive season lead to spike in fruit, vegetable prices ahead of Lakshmi Puja||KOLKATA: The continuous rise in diesel and petrol prices and the ongoing festive season have led to a steep hike in fruit and vegetable prices across retail markets in the city and districts on the eve of Lakshmi Puja. According to retailers, the festive period restrictions and higher cost of transportation widened the demand-supply gap, leading to an escalation of costs.  “Since the demand for fruits has increased quite exponentially, prices of cucumber, pomelo, coconut, pineapple and guava had a sharp rise. However, this rise is puja-specific. Once the festive period is over, the prices will come down,” said Nayeem Gazi, a fruit vendor at Mechhua, the fruit wholesale market of the city. Vegetable sellers too shared their concerns. “Damage of crops due to excessive rain and release of barrage water had an adverse impact on the supply. Most farmers are yet to recover from the massive losses they have suffered over the last one month. The demand-supply gap is pushing the prices up,” said Kamal De, president, west Bengal vendors association.  Subal Saha, a vegetable vendor at Lake Market said, “Our suppliers are still facing problem in supplying vegetables to retail and wholesale markets. But the diesel price rises seem to have hit us badly.” Another vendor Dilip Mondal of Gariahat market said, “The wholesale prices of commodities have increased a lot. The impact on the retail markets is thus unavoidable.” Vegetable and fruit prices have also gone up substantially in the districts. Prices of flowers too is on an upswing, said Ranjit Mandal, a flower trader at West Midnapore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-fuel-rates-festive-season-lead-to-spike-in-fruit-vegetable-prices-ahead-of-lakshmi-puja/articleshow/87119232.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Three days later, another four-year girl was killed in a leopard attack at Dabur village in Dindori — around 10km from Wadgaon.  The forest department had put up three cages near Wadgaon and four near Dabur in order to trap the leopards. A forest department official said it is difficult to say whether it is the same leopard that had attacked both the girls. “We have sent a swab sample of the big cat to a laboratory to know whether the leopard is a man-eater” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/leopard-rescued-near-girnare/articleshow/87114615.cms||Tushar Pawar

The statement came during a review meeting on the shortage of DAP at CMR. “The state government is in constant touch with the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers for the supply of DAP. For October, we demanded 1.10 lakh metric tons DAP while the Centre has supplied only 68 lakh metric tons leading to the shortage,” said Gehlot. Considering the scale of shortage, Gehlot said officials should reach out to farmers creating awareness on the alternate to DAP. “The officials should tell farmers that Single Super Phosphate (SSP) is better alternate to DAP and very useful for oilseeds and pulses,” said Gehlot. State agriculture commissioner Om Prakash said the state demanded a total of 4.50 lakh metric tons DAP from April to September while it received 3.07 lakh metric tons.

---||Kolhapur||Single screen theatres from Kolhapur unlikely to open from Friday||Kolhapur: While the administration has allowed cinema halls to open from October 22 (Friday), most single screen cinema halls across Kolhapur district are unlikely to open until their demands are not met. The state government has allowed reopening of cinema halls with not more than 50% of the seating capacity. The cinema halls were shut due to Covid pandemic since last two years. Hence, most cinema hall operators are in bad shape financially. Some operators have even approached the Bombay high court to let them shut down their theatres and start some other business at the same site. As per urban development rules, the purpose of the site cannot be changed and it has to be utilised for entertainment by allotting at least one third of the size of the plot. Surykant Patil-Budhihalkar, president of Kolhapur district cine exhibitors association, said, “Due to pandemic the cinema hall operators are struggling financially. They do not have enough money to resume their businesses. Also their is uncertainty on arrival of people once the halls are open. Also, the production houses do not have any big budget movies for release. In such situation the single screen theatre owners are likely keep the cinema halls shut for some days.” Patil-Budhihalkar said that the government has responded positively in favour of the demands made by single screen theatre operators. “The demands are basically to waive property tax, electricity charges and provide concession in goods and services tax (GST). We met finance minister Ajit Pawar recently who responded positively to our demands, but the government is yet to take any concrete decision and operators are not ready to resume business only on oral assurances. Those who are strong financially may resume operations,” he said/ The government has laid down standard operating procedures (SOP) for resuming operations of cinema halls. Since the government has capped the number of audience, the cinema halls are unlikely to recover the maintenance cost per show. Also, to abide by the rules, the cinema hall operators will have to hire additional staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/single-screen-theatres-from-kolhapur-unlikely-to-open-from-friday/articleshow/87119279.cms||---

Bank Depositors Protection and Welfare Society has made the Centre – through the finance ministry – the Reserve Bank of India and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation respondents. It has also urged HC to direct that section 16 (liability of the Corporation in respect of insured deposits) of the DICGC Act,1961 is ultra vires to the limited extent of imposing restrictions on refund of the entire deposit amount by use of the nomenclature ‘specified amount’, which is specified from time to time. Currently, the specified amount for refund is Rs 5 lakh. The petition is in respect of The City Co-op Bank Ltd. RBI placed it under restriction in April 2018. In August 2021 the bank issued an expression of interest for its reconstruction. In September 2021 the bank issued a circular that the RBI had asked it to create a basic claim list of depositors for withdrawals up to Rs 5 lakh. There are 91,000 depositors and a majority of them have over Rs 5 lakh deposit. “.. accepting the said specified amount will be tantamount to causing grave loss to the life saving of depositors of the bank,” the petition adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-depositors-must-get-full-refund-if-a-bank-winds-up/articleshow/87123610.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The accident has raised questions on how bikers are having access to the Maa flyover post 10 pm (bikes are not allowed to climb on to the flyover after 10 pm) despite the huge number of prosecutions by traffic police. According to police, it was in the wee hours of Monday morning - around 12.45 am - that the victim, identified as Pratik Kumar Singh, somehow lost control and skidded on the flyover. The impact, claimed cops, threw him off balance and landed on the road. Singh had managed to get on the flyover from the Park Circus end. "He sustained multiple injuries and was removed to CNMC Hospital for necessary treatment. Duty officer of Pragati Maidan police took charge of the motorcycle involved in the accident," said DC (East) Gaurav Lal. The bike had an Army sign on it. "We came to know that the bike belongs to his elder brother who is in the family," said an officer of Tiljala Traffic guard. Sources at Topsia police station and east traffic guard said that some bikers sneak through the guard rails at night and take the Maa flyover whenever they find no cops manning it at the Park Circus end. "We have men posted there. But since it was raining, the rider might have managed to sneak through.While these occasional bikers are fined, the fact that there are more accidents now will make us decide on a tighter vigil in the area at night," explained an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-maa-flyover-acci/articleshow/87119254.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kochi||Kerala: Bride, groom turn cooking vessel into coracle in Alappuzha||Kottayam: A couple in Alappuzha faced an unusual hurdle in reaching their wedding venue as the temple premises was waterlogged on Monday. They ultimately tied the knot floating in a copper vessel provided by the temple authorities. Aakash Kunjumon, 26, a Thakazhy native, and Aiswarya A, 22, an Ambalappuzha native, both working in the Covid ward of a private hospital in Chengannur had adjusted their hospital duties to be free on Monday to get married. However, the Panayannarkavu temple in Thalavady was affected by unexpected floods. The two were determined to get married on the day and the temple authorities provided a copper vessel for the couple to sail till the kalyana mandapam in the water-filled temple auditorium. They sailed around 300m in the vessel through the water. Luckily for them, the flood waters had not entered the kalyana mandapam. After the marriage, the couple circumambulated the sanctum sanctorum in the vessel. Speaking to TOI, Aakash said that when he contacted the temple authorities on Sunday, they assured him all support for the conduct of the marriage. Aakash is a cleaning staff of the hospital while Aiswarya is a nursing assistant. They were in courtship for many years and on October 15 both registered their marriage as Aiswarya’s family was against the relationship. Subsequently, both decided to get married as per Hindu traditions. Though they had approached other temples, according to Covid protocol they had to apply 15 days in advance. “This was not possible for us. We had applied for leave on the same day well in advance. We were not in a position to get the leave on the same day again,” Aakash said. Luckily for the couple, the temple in Thalavady agreed to conduct the marriage. The couple visited Edathua Church before proceeding to Aakash’s house. “We had fallen in love while working at the health centre in Edathua. So we prayed at the church here,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bride-groom-turn-cooking-vessel-into-coracle/articleshow/87121441.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

ZyCov-D, which has already been approved for emergency use by the government, is now to be tried on a two-dose regimen at Pulse Clinic and Hospital, Dhantoli. Dr Rajesh Mundhada, who will lead this trial, told TOI that trials will start from October 20 onwards. “The three-dose regimen of ZyCov-D has already received approvals. But the makers are now trying for the two-dose format as most Covid vaccines have the same regimen. The already approved vaccine with a good efficacy will be administered to at least 300 participants here in Nagpur,” said Dr. Mundhada, adding that anyone at/above the age of 12 can take this vaccine free of cost. He has appealed to interested parents to contact Pulse Hospital for online registration. They may also contact Dr Mundhada (9373103196) or Dr Atul Rewatkar (9822571411). There are many firsts associated with ZyCov-D vaccine. It is the world’s first DNA vaccine and is administered into the skin without an injection. It has been found to be 67% protective against symptomatic Covid-19 in clinical trials. The three-dose regimen will probably start this month in the country. “We have decided to host this trial because it has become most important to bring normalcy in children’s lives too,” said Dr Mundhada. According to him, children are facing severe learning and behavioural problems as schools are closed for the last one-and-a-half years. “I believe we can prevent the projected third wave fully if our kids are vaccinated. If the two-dose regimen of ZyCov-D brings good results, more schoolgoing kids can get vaccines and schools will reopen soon,” he added. Prior to this, Nagpur hosted clinical trials of Covaxin (for adults and kids), the intra-dermal and nasal variants of Covaxin, as well as phase-III trial of Covishield for adults. Covaxin has a two-dose regimen for both adults and kids while ZyCov-D needs three doses to be administered in a gap of 14 days each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-dose-zycov-d-regimen-trial-for-adolescents-to-start-from-oct-20/articleshow/87121430.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Rajkot||Married woman ended life due to torture||Rajkot: The husband and in-laws of a 20-year-old woman, who committed suicide in Gondal on October 16 night, were arrested on Monday for leading her to take this extreme step. Postmortem of Bhavika Baldaniya revealed that she died of hanging. Her mother Mamta Sharma, who lives in Rajkot, had initially alleged that Baldaniya had ended her life due to the harassment and torture by her husband and in-laws over household chores. Police were, however, waiting for the post-mortem report to verify Sharma’s allegations. Sharma had also said that on the evening before she took the extreme step, Baldaniya had told her on phone that she was being harassed a lot. On the midnight of October 16, Baldaniya’s husband Chirag had brought her in unconscious state to Gondal hospital and she was declared dead. He had told Sharma Baldaniya was feeling uneasy and had complained of chest pain due to which she became unconscious. Police said that the postmortem report also exposes Chirag’s lie, so based on Sharma’s complaint, he, his father Sanjay, mother Sonal and younger brother Hritik were booked for abetment to suicide. Baldaniya had married Chirag around three months ago after a brief relationship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/married-woman-ended-life-due-to-torture/articleshow/87119294.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Min rules out smaller gap between Covishield doses||Pune: Union minister of state for health and family welfare Bharati Pawar on Monday dismissed the possibility of reducing the gap between two doses of Covishield vaccine, citing scientific studies. “There is scientific evidence behind the existing gaps stipulated between the Covid vaccine doses in India, and we have to stick to them. We shall go by science. We need to respect these studies rather than issuing political comments,” she said. Maharashtra governm-ent is planning to allow citizens vaccinated with the fi-rst dose to participate in activities in the opened-up secto-rs post-Diwali primarily because of the long gap between two shots of Covishield. Backing the Covid task force members’ expertise in guiding different states, including Maharashtra, Pawar said, “In addition to vaccination, observing Covid-appropriate behaviour continues to be the key preventive measure.” Drawing attention to state-specific issues pertaining to containment of Covid-19 across the country, Pawar said, “In northern states, Covid cases have registered a sharp decline, but some states, like Kerala and Maharashtra, are still reporting comparatively more cases than others. Hence, the Union government has not issued blanket guidelines and has asked states to take state-specific measures.” She also emphasised on the Centre’s continuous support to state governments to bolster preparedness in view of any rise in cases anywhere. “The central government has released a fresh instalment of an emergency response package to all states to help them boost health infrastructure for the possible third wave of Covid-19 in India. This fund is to be used to create paediatric units in districts and increase the number of oxygen-supported beds and ICU beds. It is a part of the centrally sponsored Emergency Covid Response Plan,” the Union minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-min-rules-out-smaller-gap-between-covishield-doses/articleshow/87121476.cms||---
