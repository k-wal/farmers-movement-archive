During passenger profiling, the sleuths intercepted a 53-year-old traveller from Tamil Nadu and questioned him. It was established that he had traveled from Tiruchirappalli to Sharjah only on Monday and returned to Bengaluru airport on Wednesday. Since his answers for returning to Bengaluru was unconvincing, officials scanned his check-in baggage and found gold powder, worth Rs 8.4 lakh, hidden in between paper foilsAnother flyer, a 47-year-old man from Andhra, was intercepted after he got off the same flight. On frisking him , a gold biscuit and three gold bangles, worth Rs 11 lakh, were found concealed inside plastic covers and trouser pockets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gold-worth-19-5l-seized-at-kia/articleshow/86850331.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC to BBMP: Ensure potholes don’t reappear 2-3 months after repair||Bengaluru: While directing Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to ensure that filling up of potholes in the city is completed at the earliest, the high court on Thursday said the civic body should also ensure quality is maintained in these works so that the same craters do not reappear two to three months after they are fixed.A division bench headed by acting chief justice Satish Chandra Sharma gave this direction while adjourning the hearing on a 2015 PIL regarding Bengaluru city’s potholes.Earlier, KN Putte Gowda, counsel for BBMP, submitted that the civic body had entered into an agreement with a single agency and is attending to the task of filling up potholes every day. He added that because of heavy rain during the past 10-15 days, they (BBMP) were not able to meet targets and, wherever necessary, potholes are being attended to. However, the petitioner’s advocate claimed that earlier orders have not been complied with yet.At this juncture, the bench remarked that it couldn’t comprehend through what lens the BBMP was seeing the pothole problem. It also observed that the civic body doesn’t seem to be seeing the localities where common man lives.The court is hearing a PIL filed in 2015, wherein petitioners Vijayan Menon and others have sought for a series of directions, including a direction to the Palike to submit an action-taken report on repairing potholes and also providing a mechanism to enable citizens to file complaints about poor condition of streets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-to-bbmp-ensure-potholes-dont-reappear-2-3-months-after-repair/articleshow/86850497.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Alternative road to KIA may get revamped look by Nov-end||Bengaluru: The alternative road to Kempegowda International Airport, locally known as Hennur-Bagalur Main Road, is being blacktopped to remove the several potholes and craters that dot the stretch. The road will get a new surface once the rainy weather clears out, BBMP officials said.The Hennur-Bagalur Main Road was developed as an alternative road to facilitate easy access to the airport for east and southeast Bengalureans, but a host of civic works taken up on this road rendered several parts of it unmotorable.TOI had published a report — Link road to airport pockmarked with potholes — in the these columns on October 4, 2021, highlighting how a three-km stretch of the road from Hennur Junction to Kothanur police station was riddled with 406 potholes. Within 48 hours, BBMP swung into action to fix the road.A senior infrastructure official from BBMP confirmed that work to fix the road commenced from Wednesday and it will be completed soon. “Because of continuous rain it is becoming difficult to specify a completion date,” he added.“On some roads we can’t just fix the potholes. They have to be completely redone. Hennur-Bagalur Main Road is one such example,” he explained. As of now, the Palike has started levelling the road with asphalt from their hot- mix plant. “Resurfacing work can commence only once the weather improves. Once we start resurfacing and rehabilitation work, we will be able to complete in 20 days max, that is if the weather permits,” the official added. The civic body intends to spend an estimated Rs 2.5- RS 3 crore for the resurfacing and rehabilitation work. The stretch that will be taken up for work immediately is about 1.4km long.BBMP plans to level the road until November 10 and then carry out resurfacing and rehabilitation work, which is likely to be completed by November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/alternative-road-to-kia-may-get-revamped-look-by-nov-end/articleshow/86850515.cms||---

It had announced the first version of guidelines on Wednesday.According to the new guidelines, BBMP removed the 4-foot cap on height of Durga idols. The earlier limit of only one idol per ward was also relaxed; now organisers can seek permission from joint commissioners and police to install more idols. It also said that during prayer rituals, musical instruments like drums can be played. But only 50 people can be allowed at a time in batches for Pushpanjali and Sandhi Puja with everyone following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.Earlier, Surya said the curbs were not only unscientific, but the BBMP chief commissioner was unnecessarily targeting the Hindu festival and restricting celebrations.“Many Bengali organisations and associations in Bengaluru South approached me about this order. I immediately spoke to BBMP chief commissioner about it,” he said. “There is a tendency to issue arbitrary and whimsical guidelines on Hindu festivals, while not doing the same for other communities. This is a colonial relic,” he added.Surya said he didn’t understand the logic of restricting the idol height. “Some feel it’s okay to restrict anything in any manner as long as Hindus are concerned, thinking we’ll meekly accept it. But post-2014, there has been a serious renaissance in the country. There will be a very serious pushback from people if rules are laid down arbitrarily and in a discriminatory manner against Hindus,” he said.“Certain rules and regulations are selectively enforced only on Hindus and not other faiths in the country, which is a very serious cause of concern... The same kind of restrictions were put during Ganesha festival... This time, they have said dhol or dhak must not be drummed in front of the deity. This will take away all celebratory fervour from festivities and kill the festival itself. How can an administrative body decide as to what kind of rituals must be carried out? This is to be exclusively decided by the devotees,” he said.He added: “With a BJP government in the state, the interests of Hindus will be given primacy and they will be protected...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-backs-down-on-navratri-guidelines-after-suryas-outburst/articleshow/86850516.cms||Nithya Mandyam

However, no casualties were reported as the occupants evacuated in the nick of time. Around 12:30pm, residents of Sunshine Apartment felt a sudden impact as one of the pillars in the structure began leaning to the right.Residents evacuated the building within half an hour, and the ground floor gave away around 1pm; the structure threatened to crumble on the adjacent building.The eight-year-old building stood on a 60ftX40ft plot and had eight residential units, only three of which were occupied.Joint commissioner (east) K Pallavi blamed the building contractor for flawed construction resulting in the collapse. She said there could be no other contributory factor as neither the soil in the area was loose, nor were there any stormwater drains nearby.“The building stood on an A khata site in a BDA Layout. The owner had taken permission to construct a ground floor on stilts and two upper floors, but there were violations,” Pallavi told TOI. According to BBMP’s complaint to local police, the apartment was a joint venture of AN Builders, Ayesha Baig, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Iyasuddin. The collapsed structures comprised of a basement, ground floor and three upper floors.“We have lodged an FIR against everyone, including the site owner...,” added Pallavi. Ankush, a tenant in the building, said: “The security guard rushed to my house and told me that one of the right extreme pillars of the building was sinking and that the tiles of the ground floor were cracking,” said Ankush. Ankush rushed out and alerted the others. In 30 minutes, everyone took whatever essentials they could grab and rushed out of the building. BBMP said it received information about the building collapse only between 2.30pm and 3.30pm. Ramamurthynagar police and fire brigade personnel rushed to the spot. The buildings on either side were also evacuated to prevent further collapse. “ BBMP officials prepared the complaint based on findings of violations from the building owners...,” said SD Sharanappa, DCP (east).Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner, BBMP visited the spot later in evening and directed his officials to start demolition and complete the exercise by Friday.“As the building is leaning to a side, there are chances of neighbouring buildings suffering damages. We will do a thorough check before allowing occupants to get back,” Gupta said. Three families that lived in the collapsed building were trying to reach out to their relatives and friends to arrange for shelter. All of them lived as tenants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-storey-building-leans-collapses-no-casualties/articleshow/86850517.cms||Nithya Mandyam

After having celebrated Navratri last year only with family at home, she feels it is safer this year to venture out. “I feel confident because I am vaccinated and the event will only have limited participants following all the Covid guidelines,” she says.Nimesh Chhag’s NM Events is set to organise the Neon Dandiya festival after a gap in 2020, when the festival was held virtually. In 2019, the festival had seen over 3,000 people participate, while this year, Chhag expects 200 people each day on October 14 and 15. “We are getting back to celebrating the divine goddess while abiding by government and BBMP. These baby steps towards a new normal are satisfying,” he says. Yakeen Vaghela, a resident of Rajajinagar, who is organising a garba night at a play arena in the area along with his four friends, says tickets to their two-day event (Oct 9 and 15) are selling fast and the one for October 9 is already sold out. He says they are a community of garba enthusiasts and are seeing a lot of excitement among people to go out and enjoy the festivities. Both organisers say they have communicated to participants that it is preferable to attend the event if they are vaccinated and ask them to fill out a self-declaration form before entering.However, not everyone is confident about venturing out for the festivities. Preeti Jain, an IT professional, says, she is one of the few in her circle who hasn’t even dined outside yet. “Even for the festival, my siblings and I will participate in a virtual event. We are worried about my grandfather and ageing parents,” she says. Jyoti Ashok Khiraiya, chairperson of Ladies Wing, south India, Shree Dakshin Bharat Lohana Samaj says the community with 4,000 households in the city, continues to have virtual events all through the year. Lohana Samaj is a Gujarati community. “This year too, we will participate in Durga Puja installed in a Kolkata pandal. We will all participate in the aarti via Zoom and sing bhajans from our homes,” she says.“A coordinator will also play audio to which we will all perform garba in our homes in front of the screen. Each of us, dressed in our best for Navratri, will be put in the spotlight for a while. We will be able to see our friends dance while we join them. We will also feel less lonely, even if we are not next to our loved ones,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/garba-to-daniya-this-navratri-its-safety-first/articleshow/86850553.cms||---

I know where the keys are kept.” This query was made by a high school student to home minister Araga Jnanendra when the latter interacted with a few students at Police Traffic Park, St Mark’s road, on Thursday.Jnanendra replied: “Your father will be legally punished for allowing you (a minor) to ride the two-wheeler. You can do so when you get a proper driving license.”The boy was among 50 high school students who interacted with the home minister. Another boy asked why police use vulgar language and snatch keys immediately after stopping a motorist. “Vulgar language is used sometimes due to work pressure. Those cops will be handling a big junk of traffic, catching the violators. Many a times, cops resort to foul language only after the public misbehaves with them,” he said, adding, “Keys are snatched to stop motorists from fleeing,” he said.Another student asked about the means to curb the corruption to which Jnanendra said: “No one should encourage corruption. When people stop bribing, corruption will come down,” he said.Lastly, a girl said fine for riding without (Rs500) was too costly, to which the minister replied: “Earlier, when the fine was Rs100, many preferred giving the amount over wearing a helmet. Now, since it is Rs500, many are wearing helmet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/home-min-fields-questions-from-students/articleshow/86850578.cms||---

The minister's son, Ashish Mishra, has been summoned by the SIT. "Among the unnamed accused in the (farmers') FIR, six have been identified so far. Three of them had died on the spot. Two others - Lav Kush from Banbirpur and Ashish Pandey from Taranagar - were arrested on Thursday," a police statement said. ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI, "They will be produced in court." Earlier in the day, IG (Lucknow) Laxmi Singh said, "They revealed the names of three persons involved in the incident. We cannot arrest them because they are dead. We have gathered important leads from the two persons we are questioning." Click here for Lakhimpur Kheri live updatesOn Thursday morning, the Supreme Court had asked the UP government to file a report on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence by Friday. A single-member judicial inquiry panel of retired high court judge Pradeep Kumar Srivastava was announced on Thursday. It will submit a report in two months. The SIT initially announced, meanwhile, had six members - Kheri additional SP Arun Kumar Singh, who was at Banbirpur village that day, two deputy SPs and three inspector-rank officers. In the evening, a new setup was announced - the SIT will have eight members, led by DIG Upendra Agarwal, with PAC commandant Sunil Kumar Singh as a senior member and ASP Singh as a member, along with the others. “Ashish Mishra has been summoned for questioning,” IG Singh said. A notice, asking Ashish to be present at the Kheri crime branch office at 10am on Friday, was pasted outside his house. A media report quoting a relative of the minister had said Ashish had left Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. When asked, ADG (Lucknow zone) S N Sabat said, “The investigation team is looking into it.” While the families of farmer Gurwinder Singh and journalist Raman Kashyap, killed in Sunday’s violence, said the bodies had bullet holes, the autopsy report did not mention any gunshot wounds. Eyewitnesses TOI spoke to — and reported by this newspaper — had said “over 10 shots” were fired, that those in the convoy were the ones who fired and that the sound of bullets went off for hours when the two cars were burnt down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-two-arrested-sit-summons-ministers-son/articleshow/86851017.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Complainant R Puttaraju,52, a resident of Urdigere village, stated that his daughter P Inchara had cleared the physical test held for the SI post on August 21 this year. “A friend of mine, Krishnappa, a resident of Yeshwantpur, told me that he knows one Srinivas, who deals with government jobs, police department in particular.

These grand parties that went on till the wee hours were definitely missed last year, but the good news is that they are back this year, but with certain restrictions. Event organisers say that they have been flooded with requests to organize dandiya nights and these are mostly from condominiums and societies who want to organize events with a very limited number of guests. Gaurav Bansal, who is organising around six dandiya nights in NCR, says, “At most parties, the entry is only for fully vaccinated people and guest list is limited to 100 people. Even with a limited guest list, some venues have allotted different time slots to people to avoid crowding. A lot of budget is being spent on sanitization of venues, and most people want packed food or live counters only by those vendors who can send vaccinated staff to the venue.” Unlike pre-pandemic years, there will be hardly any dandiya nights with star performances and the evening shall wrap up by 10-11pm DJ Naveen, who is organising and performing at a dandiya night at a club in Rajouri Garden, says, “To maintain safety, entry will only be by invitation. Guests will have to do prior online registration for entry and share details about their vaccination status, etc. It is a good sign that people now want to come out and celebrate with friends and family, but nothing is like before. Masks will be mandatory for everyone at the party.” Organisers also say that they are preferring open air venues and a large space where social distancing can be maintained. “We have rented a place with the capacity of over 500 people and we have invited only around 100 people for our dandiya night. Dancing with the masks on is the new normal and guests will have to follow that,” says Bharat Vatwani, who is organising a dandiya night in Delhi.

But the good news this year is that at least there are small dandiya nights happening in the city and we are getting a good number of queries. However, these parties won’t be going on all night long. These dandiya nights will start early in the evening and we have requests to wrap them up by 10-11pm.” Adds DJ Gaurav, “I haven’t finalised anything yet, but I have been getting a lot of queries to perform at dandiya nights. I am not rushing to say yes as I first want to ensure that all the guests would be vaccinated and all safety protocols will be followed.

The birthday girl chose a yellow embroidered dress to celebrate her ‘golden’ day. “My friends have been telling me that you are a golden girl as it is my 50th birthday.

---||India||Maneka, Varun, Swamy out of top BJP body; Scindia in||NEW DELHI: BJP on Thursday dropped Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, the mother son-duo of Maneka and Varun Gandhi and former Bajrang Dal firebrand Vinay Katiyar from the party’s national executive, in what is seen as a loud assertion of the leadership’s authority. The exclusion of Swamy and Varun as well as that of Birendra Singh, a prominent induction from Congress post-2014, was seen in the context of them being at odds with the party’s stance: both had strayed from the official line to criticise the Centre’s response to protests against the three contentious farm laws. Bengal has found a significant representation with Nadda bringing Mithun Chakraborty, Bharti Ghosh, Swapan Dasgupta, Anirban Ganguly and Mukutmani Adhikari to figure among members of the body, in what is a clear indication that the party continues to look the state as land of promise despite the setback it suffered in the polls this May. In keeping with the trajectory where she had earlier made it to the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs, women and child development minister Smriti Irani has been brought back in the new national executive, the first one to have been set up by BJP chief JP Nadda. Prominent imports, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Dinesh Trivedi, former Trinamool MP, also figure in the 80-strong committee which, along with the parliamentary board, is considered a key decision- making body. Swamy had for the past several months been taking pot shots at the government’s decisions, besides attacking the party’s office-bearers. Though he steered clear of PM Modi, the carping had clearly sapped the patience of the leadership that had exercised restraint in the face of similar provocations in the past. Union ministers Rao Inderjit Singh and Prahlad Patel have failed to find a seat this time. Dushyant Singh, son of former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje, and former Union minister Vijay Goel are two other significant exclusions. Besides Modi, Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah and Nitin Gadkari, who all served as party chiefs, and party veterans LK Advani, M M Joshi are members of deliberative body. Harsh Vardhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar, who were recently dropped as Union ministers, have been retained. Senior leaders like Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan and Nirmala Sitharaman have kept their position. The exclusion of Swamy and Varun Gandhi as well as that of Birendra Singh, a prominent induction from Congress post-2014, was seen in the context of them being at odds with the party's stance.

Later the Pakistani terror outfit claimed responsibility for killing the teachers of Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Eidgah, Sangam, in a statement released on Thursday. “Shaheed Gazi Squad (TRF) carried out today’s (Thursday) target attack in Srinagar," read the statement, adding that they were killed because the teachers had asked the school students to attend this year's Independence Day programme at the institution. According to the staff members of the school, the deceased principal, Supinder Kaur, was a Kashmiri Sikh woman and hailed from Aloocha Bagh Bund in uptown Srinagar while the teacher, identified as Deepak Chand, belonged to Kashmiri Pandit community. A staff member said the principal and a few teachers, including Chand, had just arrived at the school around 10:30 am when the three terrorists barged in and asked for their identity cards, albeit to identify their religion. The duo was taken out and shot at, one of the eyewitnesses said. While Chand died on the spot, the principal died on way to a hospital, the staff member said. Chand was appointed under a PM package in October 2018 and was living in Jammu with the family since the time his family migrated during early 90s’ mass exodus. He is survived by a newborn girl and wife. Kour, whose husband works at a J&K bank as a probation officer, is also survived by two children — a son who is a Class 6 student and daughter, a student of Class 4. The terrorist outfit’s statement claimed that the teachers were targeted because they had urged students to attend the August 15 Independence Day function of the school. Calling it a “filthy function”, the Pakistan terror outfit said that despite their warning and threat, these teachers had “harassed and warned the parents with dire consequences if any student didn’t attend the occupier regime’s 15th August filthy function at their school”. In the statement, the TRF also threatened the residents of Jammu and Kashmir that no one would be spared if they chose to become “a pawn of occupier’s dictates or implement occupier’s dirty commands only to placate the occupier”. Despite choosing to kill two teachers from minority communities of the Union territory, it claimed that the killings had nothing to do with religion and warned those elements who try to give this a religious angle. “Our fight is to safeguard our Freedom,” the terror outfit’s statement read, adding that the “domicile holders, stooges, and collaborators”, regardless of religion, are “enemies of the Kashmir struggle and will not be spared”. The Resistance Front also warned people against installing CCTV cameras at shops and residences, “otherwise, our wrath will have no limit so shun these”, further read the statement. The Resistance Front is the same Pakistani terrorist organisation that had last June threatened to kill all Indian civilians who are not from Kashmir and plan to settle in the valley. Thursday’s targeted killing of two more civilians took the toll to seven, including three Kashmiri Muslims, in the last five days. Majid Ahmad Gojri, a resident of Chattabal, Srinagar, was killed at Karan Nagar, Mohammad Shafi Dar of Batamaloo was shot at SD Colony Batamaloo and Mohammad Shafi Lone of Hajin in Bandipora. Last Tuesday, three civilians, including Makhan Lal Bindroo, owner of a reputed Srinagar pharmacy, were shot dead by terrorists within two hours in separate incidents in Srinagar and Bandipora districts of the UT. Mohammad Shafi Lone, who was militants shot dead at Naidkhai in Bandipora district in north Kashmir, was among Tuesday’s victims. Director General of J&K Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh said that killing of unarmed civilians in Srinagar is a move to damage and attack the age-old traditional communal harmony in Kashmir. “Police have already got some clues about the previous killings and have started a probe into the fresh incident too.” Talking to reporters outside the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Eidgah, the DGP added that killing innocent civilians reflects frustration and barbarism. “This is an attempt to defame the local Muslims of Kashmir. Killing innocents is a conspiracy to target the local ethos and values, which will be defeated by the police and people collectively. Police will nab the killers very soon,” he said. Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi Thursday said that those who killed the members of the minority communities in Kashmir will be tracked down and punished sternly. “Those killing innocent members of minority communities in Kashmir want to put a break on the ongoing development. Wherever the killers are hiding, they will be tracked down and punished,” Naqvi told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-teachers-shot-dead-in-srinagar-pak-terrorist-outfit-claims-responsibility/articleshow/86852039.cms||M Saleem Pandit

During passenger profiling, the sleuths intercepted a 53-year-old traveller from Tamil Nadu and questioned him. It was established that he had traveled from Tiruchirappalli to Sharjah only on Monday and returned to Bengaluru airport on Wednesday. Since his answers for returning to Bengaluru was unconvincing, officials scanned his check-in baggage and found gold powder, worth Rs 8.4 lakh, hidden in between paper foils Another flyer, a 47-year-old man from Andhra, was intercepted after he got off the same flight. On frisking him , a gold biscuit and three gold bangles, worth Rs 11 lakh, were found concealed inside plastic covers and trouser pockets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gold-worth-19-5l-seized-at-kia/articleshow/86852468.cms||---
---||India||SC empowers green tribunal to initiate action on its own||NEW DELHI: Taking a serious note of the impact of environmental damage on climate change, the Supreme Court has empowered the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with suo motu power to initiate proceedings on its own in case of environmental exigencies and pass its order without waiting for someone to file a petition. In an important ruling that now gives more teeth to the NGT, and which would have wider implications on environmental issues, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and C T Ravikumar on Thursday said that the tribunal cannot afford to remain a mute spectator to environmental damages and has to act to address the problem. “Institutions which are often addressing urgent concerns gain little from procedural nitpicking, which are unwarranted in the face of both the statutory spirit and the evolving nature of environmental degradation. Not merely should a procedure exist but it must be meaningfully effective to address such concerns. The role of such an institution cannot be mechanical or ornamental. We must, therefore, adopt an interpretation which sustains the spirit of public good and not render the environmental watchdog of our country toothless and ineffective,” the bench said. The court accepted the plea of a batch of advocates, including senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta and Sanjay Parikh, who argued for expanding the power of the tribunal. It also rejected the Centre’s plea which took the stand that the NGT should not have suo motu power. “The NGT, with the distinct role envisaged for it, can hardly afford to remain a mute spectator when no one knocks on its doors. The forum itself has correctly identified the need for collective stratagem for addressing environmental concerns,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-empowers-green-tribunal-to-initiate-action-on-its-own/articleshow/86852909.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

I-T also searched premises connected to three of Ajit Pawar’s sisters in Satara, Kolhapur and Pune and offices of three construction firms in Mumbai. The searches will continue for a few days. Ajit Pawar described the action as politically motivated. Parth Pawar was unavailable for comment. I-T sources said they are probing some sugar mills and their links with a few shell companies. On Thursday morning, I-T teams arrived at the premises in Mumbai, Pune, Satara, Kolhapur and other places accompanied by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel. In Mumbai, I-T teams initiated a search at the premises of Ananta Merx Pvt Ltd, Nirmal Building, Nariman Point. According to the officials, the firm has three partners and Parth Pawar is one of them. The company was incorporated last year, and is in wholesale trade and commission trade. An I-T source said they are examining the fund flow of the company and its business activities. The company was included in the search due to its association with Parth Pawar, said the source. The premises of firms associated with Ajit Pawar’s sisters are also being searched. It is learnt that I-T is examining details of Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sugar Karkhana which is linked to Ajit Pawar. Recently, the Enforcement Directorate attached Jarandeshwar mill in a money laundering case linked to the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scam. I-T said it has already examined details of several shell companies and are trying to trace their connections with the firms they covered during the search.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/i-t-searches-premises-of-ajit-pawars-son-sisters/articleshow/86853164.cms||Vijay V Singh

Earlier, more than 20 people were killed in back-to-back accidents in Ramsnehi Ghat and Nawabanj areas of the district. The bus with 70 passengers on board was on its way to Bahraich from Delhi, when the crash took place early Thursday in Dewa police limits. While bodies of nine men, two women and three children were identified, the identity of a dismembered body could not be ascertained, police said. Of the 26 injured 11 were rushed to Trauma centre, Lucknow, four others sent to Barabanki district hospital and the remaining discharged after first aid. Police said, all passengers had boarded from Delhi and were headed to their homes in Bahraich, Gonda and Barabanki districts ahead of Dussehra. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences and announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each to kin of deceased and Rs 50,000 to injured. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath too announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to tragedy-hit families and Rs 50,000 to the injured. He also directed officials to expedite relief work. Superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad, said, the driver of the Lucknow-bound truck lost control while swerving past a stray bovine and crashed into the bus. An eyewitness, Chetram, of Baburi village told TOI he was awake at the crack of dawn, when a thud shattered the early morning silence. Chetram, who made the first SOS call to UP 112, said, “My house is located across the highway and when I walked down to the street, I heard screams from the mangled heap of the doubledecker bus.” Police swiftly began rescue operations and extricated bodies. Another villager, Shadab, used gas-cutters to cut through the wrecked metal to pull out the dead and injured. An FIR was lodged against unidentified persons for causing death by negligence and rash driving. “Accountability will be fixed after a technical inspection both vehicles,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/15-dead-25-hurt-after-truck-rams-bus-in-barabanki-dist/articleshow/86853223.cms||---

Three pistol-wielding terrorists barged into Sangam Eidgah Boys' Higher Secondary School around 10.30am and singled out 44-year-old Supinder Kour and her colleague Deepak Chand after confirming who among the staff were from any community other than Kashmiri Muslims, eyewitnesses said. Both were escorted out of the building and shot multiple times before the assailants walked out of the campus, they said. Chand died instantly while Kour succumbed to her injuries en route to hospital. Read AlsoKashmiri Pandit businessman, Bihar vendor among 3 shot dead in Jammu &amp; KashmirA 68-year-old Kashmiri Pandit businessman running one of Srinagar’s landmark medical stores was among three people shot dead by suspected terrorists in J&amp;K on Tuesday, taking the number of civilian casuaties in terror attacks this month to five in four days.No students were present as offline classes have not resumed; only staff members are required to be present for a few hours every day. Five civilians killed by terrorists over 2 days in KashmirDGP Dilbag Singh termed the wave of terror attacks on civilians in Srinagar — six people have been killed in a week, two of them Kashmiri Muslims — part of a strategy "to damage the age-old traditional communal harmony in Kashmir and defame local Muslims". Pak-backed LeT affiliate claims responsibilityPakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba affiliate TRF claimed responsibility for the killings, but claimed these had nothing to do with the victims' religion. "Our fight is to safeguard our freedom...Domicile holders, stooges, and collaborators, regardless of religion, are enemies of the Kashmir struggle and will not be spared," it said, specifying that the school principal and her colleague had been targeted because they pressured students to attend the Independence Day function on the campus on August 15. The outfit had also issued a statement after shooting dead Makhan Lal Bindroo, the owner of Srinagar's landmark Bindroo Medicate pharmacy, and bhelpuri vendor Virender Paswan in the city on Tuesday. The outfit's third victim that day, Mohammad Shafi Lone of Hajin in Bandipora, was a native Kashmiri. The renewed cycle of attacks targeting non-Muslim minorities in J&K, starting with Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita being shot dead in his orchard in Anantnag in June 2020, bears the stamp of the early 90s, when thousands of Pandits were forced to flee a cleansing by terror outfits. You can only fire bullets from the back, have no guts for debate: Daughter of Kashmiri Pandit shot dead by terroristsSlain school teacher Chand's family had been among the hundreds who migrated from the Valley to Jammu during the exodus three decades ago. He returned to Srinagar after getting his job in October 2018 as part of a special recruitment drive announced by PM Narendra Modi. Chand recently became father to a baby girl. School principal Kour, a mother of two school-going kids, hailed from Aloocha Bagh in uptown Srinagar.

He added that because of heavy rain during the past 10-15 days, they (BBMP) were not able to meet targets and, wherever necessary, potholes are being attended to. However, the petitioner’s advocate claimed that earlier orders have not been complied with yet.At this juncture, the bench remarked that it couldn’t comprehend through what lens the BBMP was seeing the pothole problem. It also observed that the civic body doesn’t seem to be seeing the localities where common man lives.The court is hearing a PIL filed in 2015, wherein petitioners Vijayan Menon and others have sought for a series of directions, including a direction to the Palike to submit an action-taken report on repairing potholes and also providing a mechanism to enable citizens to file complaints about poor condition of streets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-to-bbmp-ensure-potholes-dont-reappear-2-3-months-after-repair/articleshow/86853486.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Alternative road to Bengaluru airport may get revamped look by November-end||BENGALURU: The alternative road to Kempegowda International Airport, locally known as Hennur-Bagalur Main Road, is being blacktopped to remove the several potholes and craters that dot the stretch. The road will get a new surface once the rainy weather clears out, BBMP officials said. The Hennur-Bagalur Main Road was developed as an alternative road to facilitate easy access to the airport for east and southeast Bengalureans. But a host of civic works taken up on this road rendered several parts of it unmotorable. TOI had published a report — Link road to airport pockmarked with potholes — in these columns on October 4, 2021, highlighting how a three-km stretch of the road from Hennur Junction to Kothanur police station was riddled with 406 potholes. Within 48 hours, BBMP swung into action to fix the road. A senior infrastructure official from BBMP confirmed that work to fix the road commenced on Wednesday and it will be completed soon. “Because of continuous rain it is becoming difficult to specify a completion date,” he added. “On some roads we can’t just fix the potholes. They have to be completely redone. Hennur-Bagalur Main Road is one such example,” he explained. As of now, the Palike has started levelling the road with asphalt from their hot- mix plant. “Resurfacing work can commence only once the weather improves. Once we start resurfacing and rehabilitation work, we will be able to complete in 20 days max, that is if the weather permits,” the official added. The civic body intends to spend an estimated Rs 2.5-3 crore for the resurfacing and rehabilitation work. The stretch that will be taken up for work immediately is about 1.4km long. BBMP plans to level the road until November 10 and then carry out resurfacing and rehabilitation work, which is likely to be completed by November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/alternative-road-to-kia-may-get-revamped-look-by-nov-end/articleshow/86853489.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP backs down on Navratri guidelines after Tejasvi Surya’s outburst||BENGALURU: Hours after Bengaluru South Member of Parliament Tejasvi Surya (BJP) took exception to restrictions imposed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Navratri celebrations in the city, the civic body late Thursday night rolled back some measures he had called “discriminatory”. BBMP chief commisisoner Gaurav Gupta issued fresh guidelines and according to a media release, the revision followed discussions with a few Durga puja associations and officials. It had announced the first version of guidelines on Wednesday. According to the new guidelines, BBMP removed the 4-foot cap on height of Durga idols. The earlier limit of only one idol per ward was also relaxed; now organisers can seek permission from joint commissioners and police to install more idols. It also said that during prayer rituals, musical instruments like drums can be played. But only 50 people can be allowed at a time in batches for Pushpanjali and Sandhi Puja with everyone following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Earlier, Surya said the curbs were not only unscientific, but the BBMP chief commissioner was unnecessarily targeting the Hindu festival and restricting celebrations. “Many Bengali organisations and associations in Bengaluru South approached me about this order. I immediately spoke to BBMP chief commissioner about it,” he said. “There is a tendency to issue arbitrary and whimsical guidelines on Hindu festivals, while not doing the same for other communities. This is a colonial relic,” he added. Surya said he didn’t understand the logic of restricting the idol height. “Some feel it’s okay to restrict anything in any manner as long as Hindus are concerned, thinking we’ll meekly accept it. But post-2014, there has been a serious renaissance in the country. There will be a very serious pushback from people if rules are laid down arbitrarily and in a discriminatory manner against Hindus,” he said. “Certain rules and regulations are selectively enforced only on Hindus and not other faiths in the country, which is a very serious cause of concern... The same kind of restrictions were put during Ganesha festival... This time, they have said dhol or dhak must not be drummed in front of the deity. This will take away all celebratory fervour from festivities and kill the festival itself. How can an administrative body decide as to what kind of rituals must be carried out? This is to be exclusively decided by the devotees,” he said. He added: “With a BJP government in the state, the interests of Hindus will be given primacy and they will be protected...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-backs-down-on-navratri-guidelines-after-suryas-outburst/articleshow/86853490.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Five-storey building leans, collapses in Kasturi Nagar; no casualties||BENGALURU: A five-storey building collapsed in Doctors Layout, Kasturi Nagar, east Bengaluru, on Thursday. However, no casualties were reported as the occupants evacuated in the nick of time. Around 12:30pm, residents of Sunshine Apartment felt a sudden impact as one of the pillars in the structure began leaning to the right. Residents evacuated the building within half an hour, and the ground floor gave away around 1pm; the structure threatened to crumble on the adjacent building. The eight-year-old building stood on a 60ftX40ft plot and had eight residential units, only three of which were occupied. Joint commissioner (east) K Pallavi blamed the building contractor for flawed construction resulting in the collapse. She said there could be no other contributory factor as neither the soil in the area was loose, nor were there any stormwater drains nearby. “The building stood on an A khata site in a BDA Layout. The owner had taken permission to construct a ground floor on stilts and two upper floors, but there were violations,” Pallavi told TOI. According to BBMP’s complaint to local police, the apartment was a joint venture of AN Builders, Ayesha Baig, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Iyasuddin. The collapsed structures comprised of a basement, ground floor and three upper floors. “We lodged an FIR against everyone, including the site owner...,” added Pallavi. Guard alerted tenantsAnkush, a tenant in the building, said: “The security guard rushed to my house and told me that one of the pillars of the building was sinking and that the tiles of the ground floor were cracking.” Ankush rushed out and alerted the others. In 30 minutes, everyone took whatever essentials they could grab and rushed out of the building. BBMP said it received information about the building collapse only between 2.30pm and 3.30pm. Ramamurthynagar police and fire brigade personnel rushed to the spot. The buildings on either side were also evacuated to prevent further collapse. “ BBMP officials prepared the complaint based on findings of violations from the building owners...,” said SD Sharanappa, DCP (east). Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner, BBMP visited the spot later in evening and directed his officials to start demolition and complete the exercise by Friday. “As the building is leaning to a side, there are chances of neighbouring buildings suffering damages. We will do a thorough check before allowing occupants to get back,” Gupta said. The three families that lived in the collapsed building were trying to reach out to their relatives and friends to arrange for shelter. All of them lived as tenants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/5-storey-building-leans-collapses-no-casualties/articleshow/86853495.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Garba to dandiya, this Navratri it’s safety first||BENGALURU: As Navratri celebrations begin across the city, some are heading out to participate in close-knit events, while others are staying cautious and sticking to virtual celebrations. Chhavi Bagrecha, a homemaker, plans to join her friends in a dandiya event organised on a small scale at an apartment complex in Hebbal. After having celebrated Navratri last year only with family at home, she feels it is safer this year to venture out. “I feel confident because I am vaccinated and the event will only have limited participants following all the Covid guidelines,” she says. Nimesh Chhag’s NM Events is set to organise the Neon Dandiya festival after a gap in 2020, when the festival was held virtually. In 2019, the festival had seen over 3,000 people participate, while this year, Chhag expects 200 people each day on October 14 and 15. “We are getting back to celebrating the divine goddess while abiding by government and BBMP. These baby steps towards a new normal are satisfying,” he says. Yakeen Vaghela, a resident of Rajajinagar, who is organising a garba night at a play arena in the area along with his four friends, says tickets to their two-day event (Oct 9 and 15) are selling fast and the one for October 9 is already sold out. He says they are a community of garba enthusiasts and are seeing a lot of excitement among people to go out and enjoy the festivities. Both organisers say they have communicated to participants that it is preferable to attend the event if they are vaccinated and ask them to fill out a self-declaration form before entering. However, not everyone is confident about venturing out for the festivities. Preeti Jain, an IT professional, says, she is one of the few in her circle who hasn’t even dined outside yet. “Even for the festival, my siblings and I will participate in a virtual event. We are worried about my grandfather and ageing parents,” she says. Jyoti Ashok Khiraiya, chairperson of Ladies Wing, south India, Shree Dakshin Bharat Lohana Samaj says the community with 4,000 households in the city, continues to have virtual events all through the year. Lohana Samaj is a Gujarati community. “This year too, we will participate in Durga Puja installed in a Kolkata pandal. We will all participate in the aarti via Zoom and sing bhajans from our homes,” she says. “A coordinator will also play audio to which we will all perform garba in our homes in front of the screen. Each of us, dressed in our best for Navratri, will be put in the spotlight for a while. We will be able to see our friends dance while we join them. We will also feel less lonely, even if we are not next to our loved ones,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/garba-to-dandiya-this-navratri-its-safety-first/articleshow/86853511.cms||Farheen Hussain

I know where the keys are kept.” This query was made by a high school student to home minister Araga Jnanendra when the latter interacted with a few students at Police Traffic Park, St Mark’s Road, on Thursday.Jnanendra replied: “Your father will be legally punished for allowing you (a minor) to ride the two-wheeler. You can do so when you get a proper driving licence.”The boy was among 50 highschool students who interacted with the home minister. Another boy asked why police use vulgar language and snatch keys immediately after stopping a motorist. “Vulgar language is used sometimes due to work pressure. Those cops will be handling a big chunk of traffic, catching the violators. Many a times, cops resort to foul language only after the public misbehaves with them,” he said, adding, “Keys are snatched to stop motorists from fleeing.”Another student asked about means to curb the corruption, to which Jnanendra said: “No one should encourage corruption. When people stop bribing, corruption will come down.” Lastly, a girl said fine for riding without helmet (Rs 500) was too high, to which the minister replied: “Earlier, when the fine was Rs 100, many preferred shelling out the amount over wearing a helmet. Now, since it is Rs500, many are wearing helmet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/home-min-fields-questions-from-students/articleshow/86853522.cms||---

Mega-cap stocks, including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, jumped and were the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.  The US Senate took a step toward passing a $480 billion increase in Treasury Department borrowing authority, which would put off another partisan showdown until December.  Uncertainty over the debt-ceiling negotiations was one concern investors cited in September as the S&P 500 logged its biggest monthly percentage drop since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.  "Today's (market) is driven by a slight move in Washington towards rationality about being able to pay their bills, write some checks," said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.  Meanwhile, data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped last week by the most in three months, suggesting the labor market recovery was regaining momentum as the latest wave of COVID-19 infections began to subside.  The closely watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Friday.  "Today's numbers reinforce the expectation that employment will take a significant step up in the coming months, and I think that's positive for the economy," said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger.  "The market climbed its wall of worry today as fears of a debt-ceiling impasse receded and hopes for an acceleration in employment gains were reinforced."  Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% to end at 34,760.34 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83% to 4,399.82.  The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.04% to 14,653.38.  The S&P 500 materials and consumer discretionary indexes were among the strongest performers of 11 sectors.  US-traded Chinese stocks including Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings surged as concerns around US-Sino trade relations and Evergrande's debt crisis appeared to ease.  Investors will soon turn their attention to third-quarter earnings reports that start to arrive in earnest next week. Analysts on average estimate S&P 500 companies' earnings per share rose 29% in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.  Levi Strauss & Co shares jumped after the jeans maker beat third-quarter revenue and profit estimates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/wall-street-ends-with-solid-gains-investors-hail-us-debt-ceiling-truce/articleshow/86853620.cms||---

The travellers who have had their second doses — of Covishield or another UK-approved vaccine — at least 14 days before landing in the UK will not be required to take a pre-departure Covid test or the day 8 test following their arrival. The UK government on Thursday released a statement reducing the number of ‘red list’ countries to seven and said cleared travellers only needed to take a Covid test on day 2, which also can be the less expensive “lateral flow” test instead of an RT-PCR test. The decision came hours after MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi described the UK’s earlier decision to quarantine fully vaccinated Indians as “discriminatory”. British high commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeted on Thursday night: “No quarantine for Indian travellers to UK fully vaccinated with Covishield or another UK-approved vaccine from October 11. Thanks to Indian government for close cooperation over last month.” In a video message, Ellis said, “We have been actually open for Indian travellers for months. We have been issuing thousands of visas to students, business travellers, tourists.… Some of the noise about this issue over the last few weeks just shows how keen people are to travel to the UK.” He added, “Let’s open up more flights between the two countries. Let’s get British tourists able to come into India, they are desperate to do so. Let’s facilitate business travellers who are trying to come into India with e-visas.” UK’s secretary of state for transport Grant Shapps tweeted: “I’m making changes so travellers visiting England have fewer entry requirements by recognising those with fully-vaccinated status from 37 new countries and territories, including India, Turkey and Ghana.” The UK had so far not accepted India’s Covishield certification due to which travellers were treated as unvaccinated and required to undergo 10-day quarantine with expensive Covid tests on day 2 and 8 of arrival. India had on October 4 reciprocated by imposing similar conditions from arrivals from the UK.

Under the PSA technique, oxygen can be produced from ambient air by concentrating it. According to the Central government, the 1,100 oxygen plants that have been commissioned are providing an output of over 1,750 MT oxygen per day. The PM said the newly inaugurated oxygen plants were “vital healthcare infrastructure for larger public benefit.” During the peak of the second wave of Covid-19, hospitals across the country had reported oxygen shortage, resulting in several deaths. Lauding the country’s fight against Covid-19, the prime minister said it will be a matter of pride for every citizen that over 93 crore people have been vaccinated and the figure will soon cross 100 crore. “India has shown the way to the world by building platforms like the CoWIN platform and how vaccination is carried out on such a large scale,” the PM said. Modi said the country had fought the pandemic courageously. “From one testing lab to the establishment of a network of 3,000 testing labs and from import of masks and kits to its manufacturing, India is quickly moving forward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-soon-have-4000-o2-plants-output-raised-10-times-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/86853853.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Households cooked in kitchen as LPG burns a hole in budget||HYDERABAD: The common man’s kitchen is on fire in city. After high fuel prices and costly vegetables, the sharp hike in domestic LPG has doomed household budgets. An LPG domestic cylinder now costs Rs 952 in the city. Add another Rs 20-50 to delivery boys seeking extra for transportation or festival ‘bonus’, many are shelling out almost Rs 1,000 for their most basic commodity. “It’s better to switch to electric stove. Or we may as well go back to using firewood,” a seething housewife, P Hymavathi, told TOI. To cut monthly expenses, many are now opting to book only one instead of two cylinders. “We can’t afford this, we will manage with one cylinder a month now,” said V Tulasi, a private school teacher. In January, the price in city was Rs 746.5 which rose to Rs 821.5 in February after a steep hike of Rs 75. In March, another Rs 50 increase made it Rs 871.5. “In 2021 (between January and October), the price of 14.2 kg LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 215.05,” an LPG distributor with over 10,000 gas connections told TOI. “We cannot rule out LPG cylinder prices going over Rs 1,000 soon as it all depends on global price surge,” he added. The hike has hit small businesses too. Those hot breakfasts and snacks from road side eateries may soon burn a hole in your pocket as vendors are feeling the heat too. Most use domestic cylinders instead of the commercial one as per rule. With consumers also complaining about charges by delivery boys, distributors urged them to book and pay refills through mobile apps to avoid extra payment. “All oil companies have toll-free numbers and consumers can lodge complaints related to delivery boys demanding extra amount,” an LPG distributor from Balkampet said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/households-cooked-in-kitchenas-lpg-burns-a-hole-in-budget/articleshow/86850943.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||World||No firm tally of how much oil leaked off Southern California||HUNTINGTON BEACH: It's been nearly a week since oil from a ruptured underwater pipeline first appeared in the waters off Southern California and there's still no confirmation of exactly how much of it leaked.  The company that owns and operates three offshore platforms and the pipeline has said publicly that no more than 126,000 gallons (477,000 litres) leaked. But Houston-based Amplify Energy also told federal investigators the total amount may only be 29,400 gallons (111,300 L).  David Pettit, a senior attorney at Natural Resources Defense Council who worked on the response to the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, said the amount of oil spilled into the ocean should be easily and quickly known to Amplify.  "If they know what the flow rate was in the pipeline, and how much the pressure dropped, and for how long, you could calculate that in a matter of minutes," Pettit said.  "This is money to them," he added. "They know how much they lost, I am certain of that."  Local officials, who feared an environmental catastrophe at first, have more recently voiced hope that the total spillage will be less than initially feared when a putrid smell swept the coast south of Los Angeles last weekend and blobs of crude began washing ashore.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom offered some optimism about the size of the spill when he visited the site on Tuesday. But he cautioned the cleanup still requires massive resources and residents still can't fully use their beloved beaches or swim and surf in the waters in the affected area that stretches about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from Huntington Beach to Laguna Beach.  "You still have the spread, even if it's substantially less gallons, that have to be cleaned up," Newsom said. "So this is going to take time to clean up."  The Coast Guard is investigating whether a ship's anchor might have snagged and bent the pipeline owned by Amplify that shuttles crude from the offshore platforms to a facility on shore in Long Beach. A slit in the pipeline occurred about 5 miles (8 kilometers) offshore at a depth of about 98 feet (30 meters), investigators said.  Officials have been cleaning up the spill by skimming oil off the surface of the ocean, erecting protective booms to keep crude out of sensitive wetland areas and dispatching workers to collect blobs of oil on beaches. So far, they have collected 5,544 gallons (20,986 liters) of crude, according to the Unified Command, which includes federal and state officials and Amplify.  But many say the miles-wide area of oily sheen on the water's surface off the Orange County coast doesn't reveal the size of the spill as much of the crude may remain beneath.  "That is just a hint as to what the volume was," Pettit said. "Most of the stuff is below the surface and looking at the sheen doesn't tell you how deep this stuff is."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/no-firm-tally-of-how-much-oil-leaked-off-southern-california/articleshow/86854171.cms||---
---||India||Govt says infrastructure ready to tackle Covid surge of 4.5-5 lakh cases per day||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday said the preparedness in terms of beds and health infrastructure is pitched to be ready to tackle a daily surge of 4.5-5 lakh Covid-19 cases a day. At present, there are 8.36 lakh beds available with 9.78 lakh additional isolation beds for Covid-19 patients. Besides, around 4.86 lakh beds are oxygen supported and 1.35 lakh ICU beds are also available, NITI Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. However, the government maintained that the preparedness is only to ensure there is adequate headroom to ensure that people receive treatment and care in case of resurgence. “It does not mean we are saying that it (resurgence in terms of number of cases) will happen or should happen or can happen. The preparedness is pitched to be ready to face a daily surge of 4.5-5 lakh cases,” Dr Paul said. He added, it is difficult to estimate a resurgence after vaccination and natural infection. “The dynamics of the virus after vaccination or infection which can lead to herd immunity...we do not have a straight formula for that, to estimate escalation of virus after vaccination or infection. As one can see, despite the administration of vaccines, cases are being reported and we are still learning. It is technically not possible to fit it into an equation,” Dr Paul said. The preparedness is robust, sustained and being accounted on a daily basis, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-says-infrastructure-ready-to-tackle-covid-surge-of-4-5-5-lakh-cases-per-day/articleshow/86854178.cms||---

The Centre has said that it is working with states that have low coverage to sort out issues related to logistics and supply-shortage and speed up coverage. While overall positivity has dropped below 2%, five states — Mizoram, Kerala, Sikkim, Meghalaya and Manipur — still have weekly Covid-positivity of above 5%. Officials said at present there is adequate supply of vaccines and urged people to come forward and get inoculated. Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul also urged people to get their second dose on time and not delay it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/low-vaccination-rate-in-5-states-may-hit-first-dose-plans/articleshow/86854203.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||Undercounting of Covid toll in South Asia, including in India: World Bank||NEW DELHI: There is a growing feeling that official counts of Covid-19 deaths have been underestimated in South Asia, including India, and do not reflect the actual scale of the pandemic, the latest World Bank report indicated on Thursday. “The undercount of deaths can be especially severe for developing countries,” said the World Bank’s Fall 2021 economic update for South Asia. A portion of the main report titled ‘Alternative measures of Covid -19 deaths’, highlighted in a box, carried recent studies that have tried to estimate the undercounting of fatalities, which is also a global issue. Citing official data, the report said the South Asia region accounts for 17% of global Covid-19 cases and more than 11% of deaths caused by the pandemic. It also said that the total official death count from Covid in the region has exceeded half a million. The report cited several reasons for the probable undercounting of deaths in South Asian countries. First, because of overwhelmed health systems, many Covid deaths occur at home or are indirectly caused by the crisis conditions, and these are excluded from the official counts. Second, because of inadequate testing, especially in rural areas, the official counts in many countries exclude Covid victims who did not test positive for coronavirus infection before death. Third, the system for keeping vital records is outdated. It may take hospitals and civil registries days or even weeks to process death certificates, creating lags in the data, the report said citing several studies. The box in the report also carried a graphic based on the IHME database titled ‘India’s excess Covid-19 deaths are growing more rapidly than other South Asia countries’. It said the Covid-19 pandemic revealed many shortcomings in the health systems in South Asia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/undercounting-of-covid-toll-in-south-asia-including-in-india-world-bank/articleshow/86854227.cms||Surojit Gupta

The Centre highlighted that an average 4.5 lakh cases are still being reported globally and various countries like US and UK are reporting a high daily count of infections, which if estimated as per million population are close to the peak witnessed in India during the second wave. Urging people to take required precautions during the upcoming festival and wedding season and not let their guard down, Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said many pockets in India also have high Covid positivity. “We cannot take the current stable situation for granted. We have to be mindful of the fact that the pandemic is going on and can take an untoward turn if we are not careful,” he said. Currently, 34 districts in the country have more than 10% Covid-19 positivity. This includes 13 districts in Kerala, seven in Mizoram, four in Sikkim, three each in Meghalaya and Manipur, and one district each in Assam, Puducherry, Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-as-festive-season-starts-govt-says-dont-lower-guard/articleshow/86854295.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||India to issue tourist visas from October 15||NEW DELHI: Announcing the opening up of the country to international tourists almost 19 months after tourist visas were suspended due to outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the home ministry on Thursday said it will begin issuing fresh tourist visas in a phased manner, starting with foreigners arriving on chartered flights, from October 15 onwards. The facility will be extended to foreigners coming in flights other than chartered ones from November 15. An officer explained that ‘other than chartered flights’ meant that fresh tourist visas may initially be granted to foreigners coming in from countries with which India has an ‘air bubble arrangement’. As and when demands builds up and commercial flights also start operating, tourist visas will be issued for those entering India by commercial flights. “All due protocols and norms relating to Covid-19, as notified by the ministry of health & family welfare from time to time, shall be adhered to by the foreign tourists, carriers bringing them into India and all other stakeholders at landing stations,” the home ministry said in a statement. During a virtual event with a cross-section of people from Goa last month, PM Modi had said that the central government was taking steps to welcome back foreign tourists. “The government has taken a decision to give five lakh tourists free visas. Travel and tourism stakeholders will be given loans up to Rs 10 lakh with a 100% guarantee by the government,” he had announced. The decision to welcome back foreign tourists — which is expected to revive the tourism, aviation, hospitality and other related sectors that have been badly hit on account of long suspension of foreign travel — comes after representations were received by the home ministry from several state governments as well as other stakeholders to revive tourist visas. The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FAITH) welcomed the announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-issue-tourist-visas-from-october-15/articleshow/86854319.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Pens-only and extra blank circle: CBSE’s plan for Board exams in November||NEW DELHI: Candidates appearing for the MCQ-type Term 1 CBSE Board Exams this November will be allowed to use only pens to mark answers. The OMR answer sheets will, however, have an additional blank space/circle for the students to use if they decide to change their response to a question. “If four options to answer a particular question are provided, there will also be an additional blank space. If the students, during revising or for any other reason, realise that they have marked the wrong choice, they can strike it off, darken the correct circle and write the same (like 1, 2, 3 or 4 or a, b, c or d) in the additional blank space. A combination of intelligent character recognition (ICR) and optical mark recognition (OMR) techniques will be used to evaluate such responses,” CBSE controller of examinations Dr Sanyam Bhardwaj told exclusively to TOI. He also said the practical exams will be conducted by own schools of the candidates. He said, “Marks scored in the practical exams have always been questioned and very often we have seen significant variations in marks obtained by the same student in theroretical and practical exams. CBSE wants the school to be responsible and assess students on actual performance. The Term 1 practicals are to be conducted by schools themselves. Based on the present Covid situation and the vaccination drive underway, we are expecting that Term 2 practicals would be conducted by the CBSE”. With around 40 days for the exams to begin, schools and candidates are eagerly waiting for the schedule and guidelines of the exams. To that, Bhardwaj said, “CBSE will issue the instructions after it finalises the complete scheme (of the exam) and we will apprise all the stakeholders with all aspects of the exam.” TOI has learnt that students can expect the announcement of exam dates and guidelines in another four to five days once the Board gets the complete list of candidates (the last date is October 9, 2021). The CBSE has split the board exams into two parts — Term 1 and Term 2. A candidate’s final score will be calculated on the basis of his/her performance in both Terms. As per the new scheme, Term 1 will be a 90-minute objective-type exams, while Term 2 will be a 120-minute subjective tests. Both will have practicals. On the marking system, Bhardwaj said each question will carry equal marks and candidates will get options as well. “Number of questions will vary for different subjects. However, each question will carry equal marks. Also students will get options, for example a candidate may need to attempt 30 questions out of 35.” On the merit of assessing half the syllabus only with an MCQ paper, he said, “The objective type questions will also test critical thinking and analytical ability. There will be paragraphs from where the candidates will have to draw answers. The questions will be based on the requirements of the syllabus.” Taking note of the Covid situation, the CBSE is also studying the feasibility of allowing candidates to take exams in their schools or at nearby centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pens-only-and-extra-blank-circle-cbses-plan-for-board-exams-in-november/articleshow/86854382.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

The raids took place in over 50 places across Bengaluru, Bagalkot, Belagavi, Vijayapura and Davangere. A source said contractors in the irrigation department were the prime target of the coordinated searches, based on a piece of information obtained from an insider in the department. In Bengaluru, the residence of Umesh Ayanur, who was personal assistant (PA) to B S Yediyurappa during his recent tenure as the chief minister, was searched by the I-T officials. Sleuths have reportedly recovered four bags of documents from Umesh’s residence, located near Bhashyam circle. Six other locations linked to Umesh’s relatives were also raided. Umesh, who was once a BMTC crew member, joined Yediyurappa’s team after being referred by his partymen in Shivamogga. At that time, Yediyurappa was the opposition leader. ‘Umesh had links to water resources dept contractors’ Umesh’s house was reportedly searched after the I-T sleuths found that he had amassed wealth beyond his means. Umesh allegedly had close links to some contractors associated with the state water resources department, an I-T dept source said. Yediyurappa said the raids were “not politically motivated” and he got to know about it “only through the media”. “Umesh had worked for me during my tenure as the CM. He was also working for CM Basavaraj Bommai. I am waiting for his (Umesh) reaction before making any statement,” the former CM said. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said he did not know anything about the searches. He said he would react only after obtaining proper information. Residences and offices of some chartered accountants and industrialists located in Chamundeshwari Layout and Sahakarnagar were also raided. An I-T team searched contractor D R Uppar’s residence in Bagalkot city, 575km from Bengaluru. Raids were continuing in all locations when reports last came in. The tax officers are reportedly looking into discrepancies in the major irrigation schemes in Cauvery and Krishna basins, implemented by the state water resources department over the last two years. These projects involve thousands of crores of rupees.  Towards the end of Yediyurappa’s tenure as CM, the opposition Congress had demanded a thorough inquiry into all irrigation contracts awarded during his regime. Senior I-T officials remained tight-lipped and did not react to media queries. Meanwhile, former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy said, “The raids on Yediyurappa’s assistant suggest all is not well within the BJP. I would not like to comment on the raids per say, as it may be happening with certain information available with the I-T department ahead of the bypolls. But the raids on a person who was close to Yediyurappa’s son is quite evident that there is an internal crisis which may be coming to the fore.” Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah commented: “The income tax department can raid anyone but why did they raid Yediyurappa’s close aide is something which only he can answer. You (media) should ask the former CM (Yediyurappa) why his aide was raided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tax-officials-search-house-of-bsys-aide-in-bluru-50-locations-on-radar/articleshow/86854633.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||11 engineering colleges get Telangana HC interim nod for new-age tech courses||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court in an interim order has allowed 11 private engineering colleges to have more seats in computer science and affiliated courses after a tussle between the institutes and state seeking to affirm its right to take policy decisions to control mushrooming of courses. The continuation of these courses in these colleges would be subject to the final court order. The group of 11 colleges, which includes Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology, CMR, VNR and Vardhaman among others, challenged the regulations of JNTUH and state making it mandatory to take their permission despite the colleges getting the nod from AICTE for the academic year. Last year, 125 engineering institutes had got permission from the state to start new courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cyber security and internet of things (IoT) introduced by JNTU-Hyderabad. Cutting down on traditional engineering streams might be a short-sighted decision, feel a section of academics and industry representatives. Instead, they propose a creative combination of courses _ traditional and new-age _ to improve the employability quotient of students. “Dropping these courses is not the best idea. They are important for holistic development of engineering students. The problem right now is that every course works in silos. That needs to change, and we need to find a way to integrate them like it is done internationally where students are allowed to opt for a mix of traditional and other courses,” Prof NV Ramana Rao, director, National Institute of Technology, Warangal. He added: “If colleges do not have the demand right now, they can shrink the intake, but it must be a temporary arrangement.” That students from these courses have limited demand in the job market is an argument some dismiss. “For instance, in a country that has so much of construction underway, we certainly need good civil engineers…These disciplines were introduced after much thought and to say that everybody wants to pursue computer science might not be correct,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary, IT who doubled up as VC of the Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University (JNTU) for close to two years. “During my stint I took a decision that every student, irrespective of their stream, must study one module of artificial intelligence and cyber security. Such initiatives, while continuing with all traditional courses, can be looked into as an option. Discontinuing them is a short-sighted decision,” he reiterated. For Ajit Rangnekar, director general at the Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad, the problem lies in quality and not quantity. “They can cut down on seats if they have to. But if colleges are going to use them to increase the computer science pool, they need to ensure there are enough well-trained faculty to teach it,” said the former dean of ISB while also urging college managements to reflect on why there’s reduced demand for traditional courses. “Often times, colleges have very poor connect with the industry. Hence the employability rate of their students is very low. This is one area they need to look into, before deciding to do away with certain courses,” Rangnekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/11-engg-colleges-get-hc-interim-nod-for-new-age-tech-courses/articleshow/86854682.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao orders CID probe into irregularities, encroachment of waqf land||HYDERABAD: With allegations of encroachment of thousands of acres of waqf land in the state cropping up regularly, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has announced an inquiry by Crime Investigation Department (CID) into irregularities and encroachment of waqf land. The CM said orders will be issued soon. The Telangana high court had taken up encroachments on the waqf land parcels and the case was pending with it. AIMIM leaders, especially its floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, have been demanding an inquiry on waqf land. “When Dharani land web portal was launched a year ago, the government froze all endowment and waqf land registrations to stop malpractices. We are not registering the endowment and waqf land and not permitting buildings on those land parcels,” KCR said in the assembly on Thursday. Replying during a short-discussion on Palle Pragathi in the assembly, the CM gave an elaborate reply on measures being taken by the state government for the development of rural areas, which resulted in transformation of gram panchayats. Taking potshots at Congress floor leader Bhatti Vikramarka, KCR said during the Congress rule, the state’s share per capita was just 4 (funds devolution per person to gram panchayats), while the TRS government has been giving 669 (per person every month). Every month, the government has been releasing 227 crore to gram panchayats, he added. Asking the opposition members to go and see development in rural areas, which were completely neglected earlier, the CM said: “Under Mission Bhagiratha, we have been providing drinking water every day to the villages. Our plan is to give drinking water 24x7 in future.” Buoyed with the success of Basti Dawakhanas in Greater Hyderabad, the CM said village clinics (Grama Dawakhanas) would be started soon. On AIMIM MLA Ahmed bin Abdullah Balala’s request on farmers’ agitation on shifting Gaddiannaram market, the chief minister ruled out withdrawal of the government’s decision. The high court had ordered status quo on shifting of the market and allowed farmers to continue trading till October 18. “The government will provide infrastructure at the new market at Batasingaram. A new super-speciality hospital will come up at the present market at Gaddiannaram. Three more hospitals will be built— in Alwal on the northern side, TIMS, Gachibowli on western part of the city and on the premises of chest hospital, Erragadda— in the city,” KCR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chief-minister-orders-cid-probe-into-irregularities-encroachment-of-waqf-land/articleshow/86850973.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||India||To admit girls in military schools, start process in 2021 itself: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: As the Centre agreed to open the gates of military-run schools and colleges for girls, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre to start the process from this year itself and not wait for next year as pleaded by the government. On the line of its direction for allowing women candidates to take NDA entrance examination from this year, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said the armed forces establishment is capable of doing the required task and would be able to do the needful to convert ‘all-boys’ educational institutions into co-education by putting in place the infrastructure. It said a beginning had to be made from this year itself and directed that girls be allowed to appear for entrance examination for Rashtriya Indian Military College, scheduled in December. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said there is need for authorising additional vacancies along with other associated infrastructure and administrative support in RIMC before admitting girls which would be done in a phased manner. The government said girls will be allowed to appear in the all-India entrance examination to be conducted next year. But the bench directed that the process be initiated from this year. “We put to the ASG that the respondent has walked a mile and should walk a step ahead. We do believe that six months is more than enough for a disciplined organisation like the respondent to arrange their affairs. Insofar as the examination scheduled on December 18 is concerned, what is stated is that the preparatory work is over,” the SC said. “The necessary modified advertisement be issued within two days without changing the schedule,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-admit-girls-in-military-schools-start-process-in-2021-itself-supreme-court/articleshow/86854571.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Bhubaneswar||EOW arrests LIC agent for bid to swindle firm of 1.18 crore||BHUBANESWAR: The economic offences wing (EOW) of the state Crime Branch on Thursday arrested a Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) agent for allegedly trying to cheat the insurance major of nearly Rs 1.18 crore in the name of ghost policy holders. The accused was identified as Kabiraj Behera (56), a resident of Kanas area in Puri district. Between 2013 and 19, Behera had fraudulently opened 23 policies in the name of four dead persons by falsely showing them as alive. Each policy had a sum assured of around Rs 7.8 lakh after death. The accused had been paying monthly and quarterly premiums towards the 23 ghost policies. After some years, he prepared fake death certificates of the four and claimed insurance to the tune of Rs 1.18 crore in favour of the nominees, whose authenticities are being verified. “He attempted to avail financial benefits against the 23 ghost policies,” a senior EOW officer said. During verification of some insurance claim applications, the LIC suspected fraud and conducted an internal investigation. The LIC teams visited the houses of the four beneficiaries and came to know they had died years before the policies were opened in their names. The LIC then lodged a complaint with the EOW last month. In all the policies, the sum assured was deliberately kept less than Rs 10 lakh to ensure easy and quick settlement of the claims at the level of the branch manager. To avail claims of more than Rs 10 lakh, the files would be referred to the divisional office for further verification before clearance. During investigation, the EOW came to know that the LIC office had released payments of over Rs 30 lakh against five policies in the past. The EOW officials seized many incriminating documents, including voter identity cards, ATM cards, bank passbooks, cheque books and Aadhaar cards of the fake nominees. Some papers containing the fake signatures of the ghost policy holders and their nominees have also been seized. Behera had been working as an LIC agent since 2003. “We are verifying whether Behera had committed any other fraud earlier,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/eow-arrests-lic-agent-for-bid-to-swindle-firm-of-1-18-crore/articleshow/86846833.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Taking the representation of Secretariat Employees’ Federation into consideration, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy directed chief secretary Sameer Sharma to take measures to provide relief to the employees. Several employees working in the secretariat, commissionerates and directorates have been requesting the government to allow them to go back to Telangana on spouse and nativity grounds. The chief secretary directed special chief secretaries, principal secretaries, secretaries and commissioners to compile the information within 30 days. He had issued a format to be secured from the employees, who wanted a transfer to Telangana government.“The government has decided to collect information in respect of employees allotted/deemed to have been allotted to AP, who are interested in exercising the option to go to TS on a permanent basis. Accordingly, all such employees should submit their option form to their HoD by November 11,” a government order issued on Thursday said. The chief secretary directed the HoDs to submit the entire data to the department heads after completing the verification within 10 days on receiving the forms from the employees. Subsequently, secretaries should complete the verification and submit the data to General Administration Department (GAD) one week from the date of receipt of information from the heads of departments. “Many employees, who were allotted to AP during the bifurcation, are native of Telangana. Several others were struggling to work in AP as their spouses were allocated to Telangana government. The chief minister had positively responded to resolve the issue when we took the grievance to his notice,” said K Venkatrami Reddy, president, Secretariat Employees’ Federation. He said that anyone, who wanted to go back to Telangana, could also file their applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-govt-to-take-options-from-staff-who-want-to-migrate-to-telangana/articleshow/86851807.cms||Samdani MN
---||World||Heat exposure: 4 India cities in worst 10 list||India contributed to more than half of the global increase in urban heat exposure since the 1980s, according to a study published this week. The trend, concentrated in south Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa, was caused by urban population growth as well as rising temperatures, the study said. Globally, urban exposure to extreme heat and humidity saw a threefold increase from 40 billion ‘person-days’ in 1983 to 119 billion person-days in 2016, researchers found in their analysis of high-resolution data for 13,115 cities around the world. (‘Person-days’ refers to the number of extreme heat days a year multiplied by the exposed population.) India contributed to 52% of the increase, with four cities - New Delhi (2), Kolkata (3), Mumbai (5), and Chennai (7) - in the top 10. Dhaka topped the list. Two-thirds of the overall increase in heat exposure was due to increased urban population while a third was due to rising temperatures. Cities are warming due to climate change as well as the ‘urban heat island’ effect — the increase in temperatures caused by concretisation and reduced green cover. Population growth was unsurprisingly the main cause of increased heat exposure in Asian cities, for instance, while warming played a bigger role in stable-population cities in western Europe. More surprisingly, such variations were also seen within India. Population growth was the main cause of the trend in New Delhi, while temperature increase was a bigger factor in Kolkata. In Mumbai, too, higher temperatures contributed to almost half of the increased heat exposure. These spatial variations highlight the need for local-level analysis and planning for global warming, said the study led by scientists from the University of California. The study defined extreme heat as ‘wet bulb’ temperatures of more than 30 degrees centigrade, associated with reduced productivity and increased heat-related illness. The wet bulb index combines heat with humidity, which lays a role in physiological comfort. Over 2,000 cities experienced an additional month of extreme heat in 2016 compared to 1983, the study said. “Increased extreme heat is potentially elevating mortality rates for many of the planet’s urban settlements, especially among those most socially and economically marginalized,” said authors. Even some traditionally drier cities in India are seeing increases in humidity, said Lubaina Rangwalla, associate director of urban resilience and planning at the World Resource Institute in India, which is not connected to the study. “As humidity increases, the body’s ability to cool down on its own reduces,” she said. “Governments aren’t understanding public health implications of climatic changes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/heat-exposure-4-india-cities-in-worst-10-list/articleshow/86855196.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar

The USS Connecticut, a nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine, "struck an object while submerged on the afternoon of October 2, while operating in international waters in the Indo-Pacific region," the navy said in a statement.  It said there were no life-threatening injuries, but USNI News, a site specialising in navy news, reported that about a dozen sailors were hurt "with moderate to minor injuries".  USNI News also said the submarine was operating in the South China Sea, where the US Navy has sought to challenge China's disputed territorial claims on small islands, reefs and outcrops.  The navy said the extent of the damage is being examined and the incident investigated.  "The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition. USS Connecticut's nuclear propulsion plant and spaces were not affected and remain fully operational," it said.  USNI News said the vessel is now headed to the US base at Guam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-nuclear-sub-damaged-in-underwater-collision/articleshow/86855262.cms||---

East Central Railway (ECR) chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said Patna Junction is the main hub of passenger trains from where several special passenger trains either originate or pass through. “Additional forces have been deployed at Patna Junction to ensure safety of passengers and keep a strict vigil on the activities of anti-social people during the festive season,” he said. Security has been beefed up at Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction and Danapur station too. Hundreds of passengers board special passenger trains or arrive from long-distance special passenger trains daily at these stations. According to CPRO, around 130 additional security personnel have been put on 24x7 duty at the crowded stations of the Danapur division, including Patna Junction. “RPF and RPSF personnel are escorting at least 70 special passenger trains. Security personnel are also being deployed in long-distance trains to check alarm chain pulling and hose pipe disconnection at vulnerable places in the division,” Kumar said. Crowd management system has been introduced more vigorously at Patna Junction and other major stations of the division with an aim to avoid any stampede-like situation during the festive season. ECR hails announcement of bonus for railway staff: East Central Railway general manager Anupam Sharma has welcomed the decision of the Union cabinet to give productivity-linked bonus equivalent to 78 days’ wages to railway employees on the occasion of Durga Puja. Altogether 84,767 railway employees of the ECR will be benefitted by this announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/security-beefed-up-at-railway-stations/articleshow/86847015.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Business||NBFCs continue to dominate mass market loans||Mumbai: Mass market loans are turning out to be the biggest lending opportunity for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). All product segments in the mass market, except business loans, are dominated by finance companies. These include small-ticket personal loans, loans for consumer durables, two-wheelers, affordable houses and commercial vehicles. According to a report by credit bureau CRIF High Mark, private banks have built up their presence in these mass market advances. The biggest inroad they have made is in two-wheelers where they have 29% of the market. Public sector banks on the contrary have a minuscule share in mass market products except affordable housing, where they have a 37% share and business loans where they have a 59% share. According to CRIF the middle class account for 28% of India’s population. India is also one of the youngest countries in the world with more than 62% of the population in the working-age group (15-59 years), adding around 12 million people to this section every year. However, nearly 40% of India’s population remains unbanked today, presenting a huge opportunity for mass consumer banking. As a result, lenders are increasingly turning their focus on middle- and lower-income strata of the population and young borrowers who have small but often regular credit needs. “This segment of lending referred to as mass market is small in terms of value in overall lending but caters to large and growing middle class/lower-income sections of the society. However, this segment is expanding exponentially in terms of volume or count of loans. Lenders, especially non-traditional ones, are leveraging this opportunity to reach borrowers far and wide, thereby strengthening their borrower base,” the report said. The highest delinquencies in mass-market loans are in the commercial vehicle segment which has seen 14.7% of borrowers by value failing to make timely payments. This is followed by small ticket personal loan borrowers (12.7%), two-wheeler loans (11.8%), business loans (7.6%), consumer durables (4%) and affordable housing (3.7%). The study finds that those in the age group below 25 and in the 26-35 age bracket account for a larger proportion of small-ticket loans, consumer durable loans and two-wheelers. However, affordable housing, business loans and commercial vehicle loans are availed by older borrowers in the 36-50 year category. Interestingly, 69.4% of two-wheeler loans are taken by borrowers who have never availed of any form of credit. As against this only 28% of those taking small-ticket loans are first-time borrowers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nbfcs-continue-to-dominate-mass-market-loans/articleshow/86852884.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Met predicts sunny weather during Puja||PATNA: People can expect soothing weather conditions during the Durga Puja celebrations as weathermen have ruled out rain and thunderstorm in Patna and other parts of the state during the festival. The weather would remain mostly dry across the state, with slight possibility of rain at isolated places owing to low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said light rainfall would occur at one or two places in northern parts of Bihar in the next 24 hours due to low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal. “This low-pressure area over central Bay of Bengal will bring light rainfall and cloudy weather conditions in some districts of Bihar after October 14,” he added. Sanjay Kumar, a weather scientist at Patna MeT office, said weather in the state would remain calm, fair and dry till Durga Puja as the monsoon withdrawal has started from north-west India and it will also begin in Bihar soon. “Due to monsoon withdrawal, there will be no large change in day and night temperatures in Patna and other parts of the state. There will also be reduction in atmospheric moisture and humidity,” he said. Kumar added, “Presently, there is westerly wind movement at 1-2km above the earth surface, but there is an easterly wind at the ground level. After the monsoon withdrawal, westerly wind would be felt at the surface as well.” The weather scientist said a low-pressure area in Bay of Bengal has become well-marked, which may lead to landfall in south Odisha or Karnataka by October 13 or 14. “Bihar may witness an induced effect due to this system in the form of rain, cloudy sky and windy conditions. This effect will only occur after Durga Puja celebration,” he said. Maximum temperature at most places in the state is expected to remain above 31 degrees C and the minimum temperature above 23 degrees C. Meanwhile, light to moderate rainfall occurred at one or two places in north-west and south-east parts of Bihar during the past 24 hours. Chief amount of rainfall was witnessed at Gopalganj (21.4mm), Ramnagar in West Champaran (17.2mm), Triveni/Valmikinagar in West Champaran (16.6mm) and Chatia in East Champaran (11.2mm).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-predicts-sunny-weather-during-puja/articleshow/86847127.cms||Faryal Rumi

The proposed fund-raise will value Tata Motors’ electric vehicle unit at $8 billion and has attracted multiple private equity funds from the US, Middle East and Southeast Asia. TPG, California Public Employees’ Retirement System, Temasek, among others, have held conversations to lead or co-lead the financing exercise, sources told TOI. A Tata Motors spokesperson said the company was unable to offer any response regarding the fund-raise. In July, Tata Motors chairman N Chandrasekaran had told shareholders that the company would look to raise capital for the electric vehicle business and that it expects a quarter of sales to come from this business in the near future. In fiscal 2021, electric vehicle sales were just 2%. The investment would come into Tata Motors’ step-down electric vehicle arm, which plans to have at least 10 electric car models by 2025. Currently, Tata Motors has three electric car models, Nexon, Tigor and Xpres T sedan. It may also look to launch an electric SUV called Punch. Nexon is currently the top seller in India’s electric passenger vehicle market with sales of more than 7,000 units since its introduction in January 2020. In fact, Chandrasekaran too got himself a Nexon in August 2020. Tata Motors currently commands around 70% of the electric four-wheeler space. Tata Motors has been leveraging sister companies’ strengths — Tata Power (charging infrastructure), Tata Chemicals (battery cells), Tata Motors Finance (financing) and Croma (retail) — to boost its electric vehicle play. Tata Motors rival Ashok Leyland too had hived off its electric vehicle division into a separate entity, called Switch Mobility, which focuses on electric commercial vehicles in India and globally. In a Chennai International Centre organised virtual conference on Thursday, Mahesh Babu, CEO, Switch Mobility India, said legacy OEMs like Ashok Leyland are trying out the structure of having their electric business as a separate entity so that it is nimble like a startup but has the systems, processes and experience backup of the mother company as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-motors-to-raise-1bn-to-push-ev-play/articleshow/86852598.cms||Reeba Zachariah

These three oxygen plants have been installed at Danapur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Dhanbad divisional hospitals. Modi lauded the railways for installing the oxygen plants on its own. Development of infrastructure at hospitals was the need of the hour to meet the challenges in the health sectore,” the PM said. “The newly installed PSA oxygen plant at the Danapur divisional railway hospital was built at an expenditure of Rs 60 lakh, with the capacity to generate 250 litres of oxygen per minute which is equivalent to 60 jumbo oxygen cylinders per day. The new plant is equipped with the modern technology,” the CPRO said. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi was present at the Danapur railway hospital on the occasion. Oxygen plant installed at the Pt Deendyal Upadhyaya divisional railway hospital would fulfil the need of 115 indoor patients. Union heavy industries minister Mahendra Nath Pandey was present at the railway hospital during the inauguration. At Dhanbad divisional railway hospital, MP Pashupati Nath Singh and MLA Raj Sinha were present. In another function, state road construction minister Nitin Nabin laid the foundation for PSA oxygen plant to be set up at the railway superspecialty hospital at Karbigahiya in Patna with the capacity to produce 500 litres of oxygen per minute. The CPRO said the proposed oxygen plant would cater to the needs of 100 indoor patients at the hospital. ECR GM Anupam Sharma, superspecialty hospital medical director Dr R K Verma, railway doctors and nursing staff were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-railway-hospitals-get-oxygen-plants/articleshow/86846929.cms||Kumod Verma

Chanda Bharti and Varun Kumar have bagged the second and third spots, respectively. Gourav, who had been preparing for the exam for the last three years, told this reporter over the phone from Pune, “I was offered a job in the social welfare department of Bihar, but did not join it because I wanted to become a civil servant. I could not crack the prelims in my first attempt, but secured the 142nd rank the second time. Becoming the BPSC topper came as a surprise to me.” After getting a mechanical engineering degree from KIT, the 28-year-old tried cracking the exam of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), but did not succeed. He has, however, decided to give it a shot again in 2022. Gourav, whose mother, Sati Singh, is a government schoolteacher in Sasaram, said he solved online test series and relied on self-study. He, however, did not follow any syllabus. On the other hand, Chanda, an assistant engineer working with the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited in Gaya, secured the second position in her second attempt. Born to Vivekanand Yadav, an assistant engineer in Jharkhand, and Kundan Kumari, a government schoolteacher, she had not expected to perform so well. “Instead of joining a coaching institute, I followed a strict study plan. However, I had no fixed time or duration. I simply set a target of finishing the syllabus and achieved my goal,” Chanda said, adding that she wanted to crack the UPSC exam next year. While Varun from Nalanda got the third rank, Sumit Kumar from Madhubani stood fourth. Avinash Kumar Singh from Samastipur (5th), Aditya Shrivastava from Jharkhand (6th), S Prateek from East Champaran (7th), Aditya Kumar from Bhojpur (8th), Anamika from Gopalganj (9th), and Ankit Kumar from Bhagalpur (10th) also cracked the exam. The chairman of the BPSC, R K Mahajan, claimed that the results of the 64th and the 65th CCE were released in record time. “As many as 422 candidates have cleared the exam this year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rohtas-boy-tops-bpsc-exam-assistant-engineer-bags-2nd-spot/articleshow/86848607.cms||Faryal Rumi

After giving a sit-in, all the Congress leaders and workers marched on foot to the Uttar Pradesh border where there was a brief tiff with the Uttar Pradesh Police, after which the Congress leaders came back to the state border after burning the effigy prime minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Aditynath. Addressing a gathering at Uncha Nangla, Dotasra said farmers were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri and when Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi was heading there to express solidarity with the dead farmers’ families, she was detained by police. “We decided to go to Lakhimpur Kheri to express solidarity with the farmers. Those who murdered the farmers have not been arrested,” he said. “UP police misbehaved with Priyanka Gandhi. We strongly condemn it,” he said adding that "We condemn the UP government and also demand that the Union Minister should resign and his son should be arrested and punished." He said the Narendra Modi government at the Centre came to power by making false promises in 2014 and after five years, the government returned to power by using the bravery of the Army. The state education minister said PM Modi did not give an account of works he did in five years and returned to power by misleading people. Dotasra said farmers had been agitating for the last 10 months against the Centre's farm laws, but Modi and home minister Amit Shah have no time to meet them. “Who had demanded the laws? No farmer leader, no political party had raised the demand for the agriculture laws,” he said. Minister in-charge of Bharatpur and Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, former minister and sitting MLA from Deeg-Kumher Vishvendra Singh and other leaders of the party were present at the meeting. Eight people were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Sunday with four of them being farmers, who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya for an event in the area. The other four comprised two BJP workers, a driver of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra and a journalist working for a private television channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/up-police-stop-cong-leaders-heading-towards-lakhimpur/articleshow/86853830.cms||---

Amid unpacked goods and cramped space, Raju Kumar Lal, district programme coordinator (DPC), was found working in his office. “Office furniture and steel almirahs were sent by the Bihar Swasthya Suraksha Samiti (Patna) for this office several months ago. But, we don’t have space to unpack and use them. We are also unable to utilise the space of the adjacent room because the sadar hospital authorities have dumped their goods,” Lal said. “Apart from lack of basic amenities, the lone Ayushman Mitra of this office was deputed on Covid duty and he joined the department just five days back,” Lal said, adding, “Since there is no computer operator, I double up as data entry operator.” Asked about the status of the project in the district, Lal said, “Despite lack of proper office space and basic facilities, 1.51 lakh golden cards were prepared for distribution. Recently, six private hospitals came forward for the empanelment under the Ayushman Bharat project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ayushman-bharat-office-lacks-basic-facilities-in-katihar/articleshow/86847518.cms||---

The NGT had directed the state government to complete the CZMP by August 30, but an extension was till February 28, 2022. The state submitted that the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority will require an additional 60 days to complete the entire exercise of physical verification and ground truthing of all objections and suggestions, which will be forwarded to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) for finalisation and verification. “Once the draft CZMP is received by the state from the NCSCM, the same will be sent to the environment ministry for approval and the final notification, which will require another 60 days,” the state government had said. Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares said, “We had asked the NGT to give the GCZMA six months in a review application. This was dismissed. We appealed in the Supreme Court. That was dismissed. In view of the dismissals, it became difficult to entertain a new application this time from the GCZMA or the Goa government for an extension of six months.” The mangroves committees of both North and South Goa have started site inspections with respect to the objections or suggestions received by them taluka-wise, and scheduled site inspections till the end of September. Similarly, the water resources department and fisheries department have also started their site inspections and scheduled their site visits in the upcoming weeks. In South Goa, the mangroves committee carried out an inspection of four objections and suggestions in Quepem taluka on August 26. In North Goa, the mangroves committee inspected 14 objections and suggestions in Bardez taluka on August 31, and five on September 21, also in Bardez.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-cant-give-6-more-months-to-ready-czmp/articleshow/86852901.cms||---

---||Business||Give Zee reasonable time to reply: Appellate Tribunal to NCLT||MUMBAI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday held that in the feud between Zee Entertainment and its top investor Invesco, the NCLT had “committed an error in not granting reasonable and sufficient time for filing a reply’’ to the media company. “Not granting sufficient time is a complete violation of rule 37 of NCLT rules and principles of natural justice,”, the NCLAT said. The ruling was passed in an appeal filed by Zee against an October 5 order of NCLT to move a ‘simple counter’ by Friday. Senior counsel Navroze Seervai and Krishnendu Dutta said a petition filed by Invesco was being finally heard by NCLT within six days “from its filing without issuing any notice”. For Invesco, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Janak Dwarkadas had argued earlier that the company board had no powers to deny a requisition which is called for by eligible shareholders, which they were. Invesco had moved NCLT against Zee for orders to get the company to hold an EGM as requisitioned by it on September 11, to remove company MD & CEO Punit Goenka and add six new independent directors. The NCLAT said, “It appears undoubtedly, a petition was filed on 29 September 2021, and after that, it was listed on September 30.’’ Arguments were heard on both sides. “Because petitioners seeking final reliefs, at an interim stage which was impermissible,” Zee sought time to file its reply. “Granting such a sort span of less than two days’ time has in effect denied (Zee) an opportunity to effectively present its case, thereby grossly violating principles of natural justice,” said the NCLAT in its order disposing the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/give-zee-reasonable-time-to-reply-tribunal-to-nclt/articleshow/86852673.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai University serves notice to SRA for project near V-C home||MUMBAI: Mumbai University has served a legal notice to the Slum Redevelopment Authority (SRA) against a project proposed on 3.5 acres of its campus. The varsity woke up to this development when it came across an advertisement seeking objections against the construction on June 30, 2021. Incidentally, the redevelopment project is coming up right behind the vice-chancellor’s bungalow. On Thursday, senate members slammed authorities for being caught unaware about the goings-on on the campus. Senior senate member Pradeep Sawant, who flagged the issue about the project, said, “Slums had encroached on the university land, and now they have formed a co-operative and appointed a realtor, Ambit Realtech, to carry out redevelopment on this land. But the university authorities woke up when they noticed an advertisement in the newspaper. It speaks a lot about the attention being paid to the campus.” Sawant who shared with TOI a copy of the advertisement and a picture of the realtor's hoarding on the campus, added that 9,300 huts have come up over time. The gravity of the situation was shared by another senate member, Supriya Karande, when she told TOI most residents who had encroached on university land had their Aadhar and PAN cards. “The situation is grave and it is shocking that no one in the university had taken cognisance of what was taking place right under their nose in their very own backyard,” said Karande. In 2008, former pro-vice-chancellor A D Sawant with the local police had evicted the residents and broken down the encroachment. “We wanted to protect the land by putting barbed wires. However, there was no political support and the hut dwellers came back in a few days. But we always maintained a watch on them. Clearly, the encroachment has increased and the current authorities have been caught napping,” Sawant told TOI. MU registrar Baliram Gaikwad said the university noticed the ad and immediately informed the state government and the SRA that the proposed project was coming up on their campus. “We then followed it with a legal notice that was served to the SRA. We also have a BMC audit report and as per that, our university measures 243 acres,” said Gaikwad. SRA officials said they had received the university’s objection. “A hearing was scheduled, but no representative from the university came for it. Another’s being planned.” Earlier, senate member Sudhakar Tamboli alleged an ambulance was parked in MU during the NAAC assessment team’s visit. “For years I’ve been crying foul regarding the pathetic situation of the university’s health centre and harping on the need for an ambulance. But when the NAAC team came to visit, I suddenly spotted an ambulance. Where is it now?” he asked. To that, vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar said, “We have received a donation from Rotary Club. However, they gave us a used ambulance. We have hence returned it and asked for a bigger and new ambulance. It should arrive in a week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-univ-serves-notice-to-sra-for-project-near-v-c-home/articleshow/86853819.cms||Hemali Chhapia

---||Patna||No high court relief for DSP accused of raping minor girl||PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday disposed the anticipatory bail petition of suspended senior DSP Kamlakant Prasad, who was accused of raping a minor girl, without granting any relief to him. The petition was disposed as it was withdrawn by the petitioner after high court granted the liberty for it. A bench of Justice Ashutosh Kumar was hearing the anticipatory bail plea in the form of criminal appeal filed by Prasad in the rape case. The bench, while disposing the matter, also withdrew the provisional bail which was granted to Prasad during an earlier hearing held on August 25. A special POCSO court in Gaya had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail petition of Prasad on July 5. Senior counsel Yogesh Chandra Verma, who represented Prasad, withdrew the anticipatory bail plea as the bench was of the view that it was not filed as per law. Verma submitted that the case was registered against Prasad on the basis of false allegations levelled by his wife, who lives separately. He also argued that the girl was not a minor and medical examination revealed that she was not sexually assaulted. Appearing for state, additional advocate general S D Yadav and special public prosecutor (SCST Act) Usha Kumari submitted that there are strong materials against Prasad with the police to prove that the minor girl was sexually assaulted by him. Yadav also submitted that police have materials to show that the petitioner is threatening witnesses in the case. “Prasad also has criminal and he should not be granted anticipatory bail,” he told the court. The AAG also argued that since the case has been registered under POCSO Act and SC/ST Act, a criminal appeal in the matter is not maintainable. Instead, a regular bail petition under Section 439 CrPC is maintainable. Prasad is accused of raping the girl inside his official residence at Gaya during Dussehra in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-high-court-relief-for-dsp-accused-of-raping-minor-girl/articleshow/86847589.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Congress leader Ashok Ram meets Tej Pratap Yadav, sets tongues wagging||PATNA: A day after RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari’s statement that party chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav dissociated himself from the RJD by floating a new outfit, Congress state working president Dr Ashok Ram met the latter here on Thursday. The impromptu meeting between Tej Pratap and the Congress leader has set tongues wagging in state’s political circles.  Though Tej Pratap’s close associates tried to downplay the meeting by describing it as a routine affair, political observers feel that it is an indication of the growing differences between the two brothers – Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. The meeting assumed significance in the wake of a rift between the Congress and the RJD over fielding candidates for Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats in the bypolls to be held on October 30. While Ram’s son Atirekh Kumar is the Congress nominee for Kusheshwar Asthan seat, Ganesh Bharti is contesting on the RJD’s symbol. Ram later claimed that Tej has promised to campaign for his son at Kusheshwar Sthan. The Congress is an ally of the Mahagathbandhan or Grand Alliance. The RJD is a major partner of the Grand Alliance in Bihar. Tiwari had said at Hajipur on Wednesday that Tej Pratap had been barred from using the RJD’s poll symbol, lantern, for his new students’ wing, Chhatra Janshakti Parishad. He had also said Tej Pratap was no longer associated with the RJD. “There is no point taking action against him when he has floated a new outfit,” Tiwari had said. Tej had earlier got his organisation registered with ‘flute’ as its symbol. Chief spokesperson of Chhatra Janshakti Parishad, Mohit Sharma, however, said Tej was still in the RJD. “Some people are trying to create a rift in the RJD’s first family by making such statements,” he added. Meanwhile, parishad’s state president Prashant Pratap Yadav said the organisation’s functionary, Sanjay Kumar, may contest the bypoll from Tarapur as an independent candidate. Kumar is the president of Munger division of the parishad. Taking a potshot at RJD, JD(U) spokesperson Nikhil Mandal on Thursday tweeted, “Is it true, Baba? Why are you so calm? Tejashwi is also maintaining silence (sic).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-neta-meets-tej-sets-tongues-wagging/articleshow/86847278.cms||Ramashankar

He was speaking at a rally to protest the recent killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri of Uttar Pradesh and the arrest of Priyanka Gandhi at the Uttar Pradesh border. He said that people supported the Congress government, but were still facing issues like bad roads, power outage and shortage of water in Bharatpur district. He said it was time the government took care of people. Singh claimed that the farmers were not getting manure and they were reeling under financial loses. Singh asked Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Govind Singh Dotasra and minister, Dotasra, "Where is the fertilizers for farmers?" Vishvendra Singh is known for his outspoken nature. Singh was a part of the Sachin Pilot group earlier, but now he said to be in Gehlot's camp. Taking a dig at Dotasara and district in-charge and minister, Mahesh Joshi, he said, "Today the problem of roads, electricity and water continues to be a serious issue in Bharatpur, due to which nobody is ready to marry off their daughters to Bharatpur." Congress officials and ministers under the leadership of Dotasra reached the Uttar Pradesh border for the agitation.

Justice Pandey was earlier registrar general of Patna high court. Both Pandey and Panwar have been elevated to high judiciary from subordinate judiciary quota of the state. Chief Justice Sanjay Karol administered oath to both in a simple ceremony organised inside centenary building of the high court. Other judges were also present on the occasion. It is nearly after one-and-a-half-years that new judges have been appointed in the high court. The strength of judges here had depleted to 18 which has now increased to 20 with fresh appointments.

Bihar State Bar Council chairman Ramakant Sharma congratulated the new judges and said the bar is highly optimistic about clearance of the six names by the Centre for their appointment as judges soon.

---||Business||Piramal to demerge financial services & pharma business||MUMBAI: The Piramal Enterprises board on Thursday approved a proposal to demerge the pharmaceutical business, which would result in two separate listed entities exclusively in the pharma and finance business. Shareholders of Piramal Enterprises (PEL) will get four shares of Piramal Pharmaceuticals (PPL) for every one share they hold. Two operating subsidiaries of PPL will also be amalgamated with their parent. The consolidation follows the group’s acquisition of DHFL. Piramal Enterprises will transform into a large listed NBFC with PHL Fininvest Private merging with the parent. The merged housing finance company, after the DHFL acquisition, will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises. “PEL is transforming itself from a multi-sector conglomerate structure into two separate sector-focused listed entities in financial services and pharmaceuticals. The demerger is expected to unlock significant value for PEL shareholders. Both listed entities will have a leadership position in their respective sectors,” the group said. “This will firmly empower both entities to be future-ready and enable them to independently pursue their growth strategies with sharper focus and identity,” said Ajay Piramal, chairman, Piramal Group. Currently, PEL owns the financial services business through four investments verticals - housing finance, lending, alternatives and investments (Shriram group companies). PEL also has a 80% stake in Piramal Pharma which owns Convergence Chemicals Hemmo Pharmaceuticals and stake in a joint venture with Allergan. PPL also has overseas subsidiaries. Post-restructuring, PEL’s shareholders will directly own PPL which will absorb the two subsidiaries and own the joint venture with Allergan and overseas subsidiaries. PEL will absorb the NBFC lending business and own the housing finance company, alternatives business and investments in Shriram. Piramal Alternatives, the fund management business, provides customised financing solutions to high-quality corporates through – ‘Piramal Credit Fund’ and ‘IndiaRF’ (a distressed asset investing platform with Bain Capital Credit). The financial services business contributes Rs 7,033 crore or 55% of the group’s revenues with Pharma contributing the balance 45% (Rs 5,776 crore). The financial services business post-consolidation will have a Rs 65,000 crore loan book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/piramal-to-demerge-fin-services-pharma-biz/articleshow/86852731.cms||---

However, the names of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap, state president Jagadanand Singh and national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari were missing from the list. Lalu’s name appeared on the top among the 20 star campaigners for the bypolls. If the list is to be believed, Lalu will campaign in favour of the party's official candidates Ganesh Bharti (Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga) and Arun Kumar Sah (Tarapur in Munger). Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Shyam Rajak, Jay Prakash Narain Yadav, Uday Narayan Choudhary, Bhola Yadav, Anil Kumar Sahni, Manoj Kumar Jha, Brishin Patel, Ashok Kumar Mehta, Lovely Anand and Shiv Chandra Ram were prominent leaders among others named as star campaigners.

He also asked them to identify the main features that could be included in these schools, besides the kind of facilities that would be required. Nitish said this during the review of the progarmmes, schemes and activities taken up by the SC and ST welfare department for the uplift of these sections. At the review meeting, department’s secretary Diwesh Sehra made a detailed presentation on various schemes. Those present included SC/ST welfare minister Santosh Kumar Suman, principal secretary to CM Deepak Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan and other senior officials.

Besides, he urged motorists and pillion riders to wear good quality helmets while driving two-wheelers. Laying stress on the importance of wearing helmets, transport minister, Sheela Kumari, said, “The absence of helmets increases the risk of death in case of road accidents. As many as 525 people, who were travelling without helmets, lost their lives in 2019 and 347 people in 2020.” Rule 138 (4) (f) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 makes it mandatory for manufacturers to supply protective head gears to customers at the time of purchase of two-wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dealers-to-provide-helmets-to-buyers/articleshow/86849123.cms||Faryal Rumi

Despite the restrictions imposed by the district administration to check the spread of Covid-19 during the festival, a large number of devotees, mostly women, flocked to temples and pandals for worshipping Goddess Durga.  They also visited different ghats for collecting ‘Gangajal’ before performing religious rituals at home. According to priests, Goddess Durga is believed to have arrived in a palanquin this year. Pundit Bhup Narayan Pathak, a priest at a temple near DPS Mor, told this reporter that the arrival of the goddess in a palanquin spelled widespread epidemic. However, her departure on an elephant would be auspicious as “it is an indicator of prosperity”. Pathak added, “Quite a few devotees reached the temple on Day 1 of Navaratra to seek the blessing of the goddess.” The Mahavir Temple near the Patna Junction also witnessed huge footfalls on Thursday. The secretary of the Mahavir Mandir Trust, Acharya Kishore Kunal, performed ‘kalash sthapana’ along with the other priests. “With a view to curbing the spread of Covid-19, we are using loud speakers to request all the devotees to follow social distancing norms. We have also made hand sanitisers available for them,” Kunal said. Rajesh Sharma, the secretary of a Durga Puja committee on Gola Road, pointed out that banners and posters, urging people to follow Covid safety protocols, would be put up at his pandal.

Health minister, Mangal Pandey, told this reporter on Thursday that all the district magistrates and the civil surgeons had been asked to set up Covid vaccination camps at large pandals with the help of Durga Puja organisers and committees. “The health department will depute doctors, auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), and data entry operators at the camps and get the visitors tested for Covid,” the minister said, adding that all the districts had been asked to send a list of all the big pandals where vaccination camps could be put up. The government has set a target of inoculating 1 crore people by the end of October. “If this happens, our target of vaccinating 6 crore beneficiaries in six months will be achieved in only five. We have already inoculated 5.95 crore people with the first dose of the Covid vaccines,” Pandey claimed. Talking about the ‘Teeka Utsav’, the civil surgeon of Patna, Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, said the sub-divisional officers had been directed to prepare a list of pandals where the camps could be set up. “There are 1,100 ANMs and more than 500 data entry operators in the district. If we require more health workers, we will hire them from private health facilities,” she added. Each vaccination camp will have a doctor, an ANM, and a data entry operator. Dr Vibha said, “The people visiting the pandals will have to give their Aadhaar number so that their names can be uploaded to CoWIN.” Meanwhile, the Durga Puja organisers and committees in the city welcomed the decision of the health department to set up vaccination and testing camps at pandals. Santosh Kumar, a member of the Vijay Vahini Durga Puja Samiti in Anandpuri, asked, “Can anything be better than getting vaccinated in the presence of Goddess Durga?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-set-up-vax-camps-at-pandals-to-keep-covid-at-bay/articleshow/86847085.cms||Faryal Rumi

The promoters of Srei, Adisri Commercial Private and Hemant Kanoria had in their petition accused the RBI of acting in haste and an arbitrary manner. The promoters’ counsel also argued that the company had been following the RBI directions and had lined up investors who would be bringing over Rs 4,000 crore in the company. The petition sought a stay on initiating insolvency proceedings against Srei Infrastructure Finance (SIFL) and Srei Equipment Finance (SEFL). A bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar dismissed the plea, saying it will give detailed reasons later. “We have heard the counsels. For reasons to be dictated separately, we are not inclined to entertain the writ petition. The writ petition is dismissed,” the HC said. The RBI had superseded the boards of the company, citing governance issues and other lapses. An RBI-appointed administrator assisted by a three-member advisory committee has already taken charge of the company. The RBI’s counsel said that the regulator had found governance issues with the two NBFCs, which had been given enough time. He also pointed out that the NBFCs were found to be evergreening their loans and were engaged in related party transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bombay-hc-dismisses-sreis-plea-against-rbi/articleshow/86852757.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The bench of Justice Vikash Jain and Justice Anjani Kumar Sharan, while hearing her appeal, however, ordered that counting of votes and declaration of results for the post of mukhiya in the panchayat from where Hirawati will contest, cannot be declared till further orders. The bench also directed the authorities concerned to allot election symbol to Hirawati. Earlier, a bench of Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice Anjani Kumar Sharan had granted relief to Hirawati on October 1 by directing the Kaimur DM to accept her nomination papers for contesting the election for the post of mukhiya from Lohdan. Hirawati had earlier filed a writ petition challenging her sacking on grounds of procedural irregularities by a single bench, which had not granted her any relief earlier this year after which she filed an LPA. Hirawati was the mukhiya of Lohdan panchayat in Chand block in Kaimur. She was sacked by the panchayati raj department principal secretary after an inquiry on October 28, 2019 on charges of misconduct and misappropriation of funds. She was later barred from contesting panchayat elections for five years as per Section 18 of Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006. The action was taken after Hirawati allegedly defalcated Rs 33.97 lakh while being mukhiya. The fund was meant for developmental projects under state government’s seven-resolve scheme. However, she later repaid Rs 35.22 lakh, including simple interest against the defalcated fund. The department had ordered charging compound interest for the period during which she had defalcated the amount. The election for the post of mukhiya for Lohdan panchayat is scheduled to take place on October 20. The bench has fixed October 21 as the next of hearing in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/high-court-allows-sacked-mukhiya-to-contest-polls/articleshow/86847248.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Being built at a cost of Rs 39.7 crore, the school would be ready within a year. The school would have a semi-Olympic-sized swimming pool, while the terrace would be utilised for building basketball, tennis and volleyball courts.

Unique in itself, basketball, tennis and volleyball courts will be made on the roof to facilitate outdoor sports activities,” added the statement. Sisodia said, “The school has been designed keeping in mind the overall development of children. This building will be different from normal schools and the entire premises will be used in the learning process of children.” There would be smart classrooms suitable for digital learning. An auditorium with a seating capacity of 800 and an open amphitheater with a capacity of 1,000 people have also been planned within the premises. The length and width of the swimming pool would be 25m and 12.5m, respectively, to allow maximum children to practise swimming at the same time.

However, they were stopped during the pandemic-induced lockdown.He said they had been batting for the resumption of train services from Coimbatore to Madurai via Pollachi, which were discontinued 10 years ago. “Coimbatore must be connected to Tirunelveli by an intercity day express train and Rameswaram by an overnight express train daily as in the past. Both the trains used to cover Pollachi, Palani, Dindigul and Madurai.”J Sathish, coordinator, CDC, said they decided to run the signature campaign to make the railway authorities understand the importance and necessity of the suspended train services. “The campaign will go on till they re-introduce the six trains.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao ups the ante against Centre on states’ rights||HYDERABAD: After criticising the Union government for ignoring Telangana’s heritage and culture and in Padma awards on the floor of the assembly a couple of days ago, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao lashed out at the Centre again alleging that the BJP government at the Centre was infringing upon the rights and powers of states. KCR said Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin had written a letter to him a couple of days ago talking about states’ rights. “We will fight for the rights of the states and protest against the attitude of the NDA government,” he said. “Being chief minister of the state and also president of a regional political party, I am saying this clearly. Both BJP and Congress are same as far as taking over powers of states are concerned. Recently, the Centre tried to bring petrol and diesel under GST after bringing several taxes under the GST regime. Even BJP-ruled states opposed this during the recent GST council meeting in Lucknow,” KCR said. Under the BJP government, it was Deen Dayal Grameen Yojana and the Congress government had earlier named it Jawahar Yojana, but the essence of the scheme was the same. For that matter, even the labourers’ wages under the MGNREGS, the NDA government wanted to deposit in their accounts from Delhi, he said. “Recent RBI report clearly said Telangana is one of the four states which contributes more for the country’s GDP. Devolution of taxes by the Centre is our right,” he said. Apart from granting the mandatory funds, the Centre was not cooperating much with Telangana, KCR said. “Whether it is Mission Bhagiratha or Mission Kakatiya, the Telangana government did not get a penny. Instead of enhancing allocations every year, 25% cut was imposed on rural development funds on the recommendation of 15th Finance Commission,” he said. Earlier, the state was getting Rs 1,847 crore a year which has now fallen to Rs 1,340 crore. The Niti Aayog had praised Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya and recommended an assistance Rs 24,000 crore, but the Centre had not given a single rupee and merely gave some awards and praised the state in Parliament, he said. He said the state government would come out with a plan in November first week on the procurement issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-ups-the-ante-against-centre-on-states-rights/articleshow/86850268.cms||Koride Mahesh

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh made the observations while hearing a public interest litigation by a lawyer. It also noted that the government has provided adequate healthcare facilities and is presently providing free vaccines to the public, so nothing much survives in the plea. The Centre’s counsel, Anil Soni, said that the petition, filed in March 2020, was now infructuous as adequate measures had already been taken by the authorities against the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-reason-for-us-to-track-covid-steps-as-govts-doing-enough-hc/articleshow/86850279.cms||---

---||Lucknow||6 OBCs, 1 Dalit & 2 Brahmin leaders from UP inducted in BJP nat’l exec||Lucknow: The BJP brass carried out a deft caste arithmetic by inducting six OBCs, one Dalit and two Brahmin leaders from poll-bound UP in its national executive committee announced on Thursday. As many as 42 members from Uttar Pradesh, including PM Narendra Modi are part of the party’s apex decision-making body. Among key most-backward caste faces in the list are state minister Swami Prasad Maurya, an MLA from Padrauna, and Dara Singh Chauhan, MLA from Madhuban in Mau. Chauhan hails from ‘Nunia’ backward sub-caste, which has a sizable presence in eastern UP. Significantly, both Maurya and Chauhan defected to the saffron camp from the Mayawati-led BSP. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh is the other big name from the OBC bracket to be inducted in the national executive committee. Cabinet minister Anil Rajbhar too has been accommodated as a special invitee — a move seen as a counter to former ally and SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has been flexing muscle to challenge BJP. Likewise, party’s Fatehpur MP and Union minister of state Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, too, has been named in the national executive for the first time. Jyoti hails from Nishad (fishermen) community, which has significant electoral presence in 60 assembly seats in east UP. Her induction in the national executive comes close on heels of BJP cobbling up an alliance with the Sanjay Nishad-led NISHAD party in run-up to polls. BJP MP from Dhaurahra, Rekha Verma, a Kurmi, too finds a place in the list by virtue of being party vice-president for over a year. In 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Verma defeated Congress turncoat Jitin Prasada, who joined BJP in July and was recently inducted in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet. Bareilly MP Santosh Gangwar, a prominent Kurmi leader in Rohilkhand region, too has been accommodated as a member. The development once again brought the spotlight on BJP’s concerted attempts to consolidate the OBC vote-bank, which accounts for 42% of the voting population in UP. This is also seen as a saffron outfit’s counter to regional political outfits, including SP and BSP’s aggressive attempts to woo Brahmins, who otherwise have traditionally voted for BJP. BJP also played the upper-caste card by inducting UP minister Brijesh Pathak as a member. A BSP turncoat and Brahmin, Pathak is considered to have played a key role in Mayawati’s social engineering formula that propelled her to power with full majority in 2007 assembly elections. BJP has also included former Meerut MLA Laxmi Kant Bajpai, a Brahmin, in the national executive as a special invitee. Similarly, former Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya, who was recently appointed BJP vice-president will be a member of the national executive. A former mayor of Agra, Baby Rani is being projected as a Dalit face of BJP. Earlier, BJP had appointed Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, a prominent OBC face in the Modi cabinet, as in charge of UP elections. This, besides the induction of three OBC leaders — BL Verma (Lodh), Pankaj Chaudhary (Kurmi) and Anupriya Patel (Kurmi) — in the Union cabinet .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/6-obcs-1-dalit-2-brahmin-leaders-from-up-inducted-in-bjp-natl-exec/articleshow/86853849.cms||Pankaj Shah

He urged the Coimbatore corporation to collect the dues with an iron hand since the civic body has been reeling under a financial crunch, forcing it to abandon projects to improve public amenities.Following the development, corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara instructed revenue officials to issue notices to the defaulting companies and institutions.Subsequently, TPCL, which has a total of Rs 4.92 crore pending as on September 24, paid Rs 1.64 crore for the first and second half of 2019-2020 financial year.Although several defaulters featured in the top defaulters list have approached courts, the civic body failed to collect pending dues even after the court cases concluded in its favour, Thiyagarajan said. “As of September 24, a total of Rs 42.30 crore is pending from top 17 defaulters. Many of them have moved court seeking exemption. While a case ended in favour of the assessee, four cases ended in favour of the corporation. Three assesses have to pay Rs 4.18 crore to the corporation. I request the civic body to check the status of the cases and expedite the process,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-firm-pays-rs-1-6-cr-property-tax-dues-as-corpn-cracks-whip/articleshow/86850239.cms||---

DRI officials, on specific intelligence, detained a container that had arrived from Iran at Nhava Sheva in Navi Mumbai and carried out a search on October 4. “We found a packet containing white powder purportedly to be heroin, weighing around 25.6kg, between the groundnut oil and other items. We seized the packet,” said an official. On learning that the container was imported by Sandeep Thakkar of Vaibhav Enterprises, which has an office at Masjid Bunder, the officials questioned him. Thakkar reportedly told the DRI officials that Sanghvi had offered him Rs 10,000 per consignment to import goods from Iran on his firm’s IEC. Thakkar further stated that since he had been doing business with Sanghvi since 15 years, he trusted him, said an DRI official. DRI officials then arrested Sanghvi and booked him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psyhotropic Substances Act. On Thursday, he was produced before metropolitan magistrate’s court, which remanded him to DRI custody till October 11. While seeking Sanghvi’s custody, the DRI claimed he is part of a syndicate and they need to question him to get details of all those involved. The DRI suspects that similar consignments may have been smuggled in earlier too. In July, the DRI Mumbai unit had seized 293kg of heroin from a Mumbai port and had apprehended Prabhjit Singh, the proprietor of Sandhu Export Punjab, which had imported the consignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-125cr-heroin-concealed-in-consignment-of-oil-seized-bizman-held/articleshow/86852234.cms||Ahmed Ali

However, each household of 10 districts of Bundelkhand and Vindhya region will become equipped with tap water by December-end, he added. Addressing the valedictory session of a conclave under The Times of India’s ‘Make UP a water positive state’ initiative at hotel Taj Ganges here on Wednesday evening, the CM said, “Most of the government programmes have multiple purposes. We ensured the planting of 100 crore saplings in the recent plantation drive, and only trees and plants like peepal, banyan, pakad, neem, desi mango, which have medicinal quality and are beneficial for nature, earth and human beings, were preferred.” “Third party verification of the plantation drives in the past three-four years has shown that green cover of the state has improved,” said Yogi adding, “The improved forested area will improve the life of rivers as it is a known fact rivers passing through jungles have a better flow of water.” The tap water supply of each household in seven districts of Bundelkhand and three of Vindhyachal region under Jal Jivan Mission will be completed by December, while in other parts of the state this project will be finished by 2023, he said. The CM further stated that the water crisis in Bundelkhand is over with hectic efforts of restoration of water bodies. We are also going to ink an agreement for linking Ken and Betwa rivers soon, he added. Referring to the apathy of previous governments that lingered 12 ambitious irrigation projects like Bansagar for four-five decades, he said, “After coming to power in 2017, I ensured completion of Bansagar project within a year, which helped in improving irrigation facilities in 2.5 lakh hectare area.” “Other major irrigation projects will be completed soon to make an additional irrigation facility for 22 lakh hectare land by incorporating advanced technologies of irrigation like sprinklers to avoid wastage of water,” he stated. The CM praised the Kashi model of groundwater recharging, and said that officials in Varanasi decided to utilize defunct hand pumps for rainwater harvesting by fixing filters. “This experiment brought down the cost of installation of the rainwater harvesting system,” he said adding, “By spending only Rs 15,000-Rs 25,000, one model of rainwater harvesting was prepared and the result also proved to be outstanding. Chitrakoot model of rainwater harvesting also yielded good results,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/record-plantation-by-us-hasimproved-ups-green-cover/articleshow/86852232.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

A team comprising collector G S Sameeran, district educational officer Geetha and regional transport officers Sathiyakumar, Kumaravel, Balamurugan and Sivagurunathan inspected 309 school buses on PRS Ground here on Thursday, when 33 buses were found to have minor defects. A transport department official said there were 1,226 school buses in the district. “They are operated by 230 private schools. Today (Thursday), 309 vehicles were checked for safety aspects. Most of them were new buses and structurally fit. The minor defects that were detected in the 33 buses included absence of fire extinguishers and first aid boxes, among others. The remaining school buses will be inspected in a few days.” He said the school buses were checked for the height of footsteps, window size, emergency exits, speed governors, partition for driver, first aid box and fire safety equipment. Referring to the buses with defects, the official said the schools were asked to ratify the issues and take the vehicles to the regional transport office for approval. “Otherwise, the buses can’t be used to transport the students.” While the schools were already operating buses to ferry students of classes IX to XII, the official said only 25% of the 1,226 school buses was utilized for the same. It is to be noted that school buses are inspected for safety aspects every year. However, it was not done in 2020, as the schools were shut because of the pandemic situation.

These organisations, though, have assailed them, saying HC “has effectively, expanded the circle of silence on sexual harassment of women, prevalent in society, to itself”. Their letter states the order operates on the assumption that the parties in sexual harassment cases are equal. “The court has failed to consider that often it is the lone voice of one aggrieved woman, pitted against large corporates and their powerful male seniors and/or their bosses.” It points out the POSH Act provides confidentiality for the survivor but “the court has extended protection to the accused as well”. It also states that the blanket prohibition on the disclosure of identities of the parties forces the survivor “to hide her identity and the identity of the person who harassed her without taking into account her choice and her freedom of speech”. It also keeps her or the media from discussing any part of the proceedings and invites contempt of court. The letter states that with anonymity of records, in-camera proceedings, ban on upload and publication of orders and judgments, it will make a survivor’s access to justice prohibitive, especially if she does not live within the jurisdiction of a court. It asks what is so “specific” about POSH Act and those accused under it that “the accused require the court to carve out this veil of anonymity which is not accorded to any other accused under any other laws”. The letter says the ripples of the order may not be confined to cases under the POSH Act. Taking a cue from this, the courts may start issuing gag orders in matters of sexual harassment or other sexual offences which may have no connection with this Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-urged-to-remove-posh-rules-on-hiding-accuseds-id/articleshow/86853860.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The road, connecting Vilankurichi and Avinashi Road, has been in bad shape for more than a year. As the width of the road shrunk, traffic snarls became frequent. The stretch turned slushy and posed risk to commuters whenever it rained. Several people met with accidents at night due to poor illumination, residents said.Residents and commuters were bearing the brunt while the work taken up by Gail delayed due to various reasons. They lodged complaints to officials, including the corporation commissioner and also took to social media platforms.Recently, corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara conducted an inspection to assess the condition of the road and instructed officials to repair it.An official with the civic body’s east zone said that Gail had promised to complete the work by September. “Now it looks like it will take one more month. Considering the suffering of commuters, the corporation commissioner ordered us to begin work to level the surface,” he said. “Men and machinery were roped into to carry out the work, which started on Monday. It will be completed in a couple of days. However, work to lay a proper road will begin only after the project is completed by Gail.”Another official said that they cannot lay a bitumen road immediately as the road would get damaged frequently. “We will have to spread gravel at the places where digging took place and spread concrete mixture. Only then the stretch would be ready for laying a new road. It might take anywhere between four to six months after the pipe laying project is done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vilankurichi-road-gets-ready-for-smooth-ride/articleshow/86850292.cms||V Devanathan

The move will make holding such events more easier in the city. People can now apply for the licence seven days in advance, which will give them more room for planning. Earlier, only two days were given to people to apply for the licence. P10 licence is needed for serving liquor in any party, function, weddings and similar events at specified premises, including farmhouses, banquet halls and other such premises anywhere in the capital. In a circular issued earlier this week, the excise department announced that people concerned can apply for P10 permit seven days before the function or party and the applicant can purchase liquor from six stores. An official said that earlier, anyone willing to apply for P10 licence was supposed to apply only two days before the event and could purchase liquor from only three liquor stores. The relaxations are aimed to make it convenient for people to organise parties and the relaxations may help many because it has come at the height of the festive season. Application for grant of P-10 licence can be made online or through the excise department. The relaxation has been provided till November 30. An individual who wants to serve liquor to his guests at his residence does not need a licence provided the liquor served is within the permissible possession limit of nine litres, said an excise official. Meanwhile, the excise department has also invited applications for various categories of licences for 'onsite' consumption of liquor in hotels, clubs, motels and restaurants in Delhi. Under the new excise policy, the government has already awarded licences for 850 vends of retail liquor sale in 32 zones across the capital. Under the same policy, the existing licences for ‘on-site’ consumption of liquor will be renewed after the applications are made. All 260 private liquor stores have been shut down in the city from October 1 onwards under the new policy and the government liquor shops will shut down from November 17 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/licence-norms-for-procuring-liquor-for-parties-eased/articleshow/86850263.cms||---

The TWC was organised in association with the Uttar Pradesh government to focus on water quality, its conservation and supply, highlight the work done in the state in this area and to discuss the way forward. Through this summit, TOI tried to connect and bring the best minds and decision-makers together at one single platform and make a long-term sustainable water roadmap for the state. “TWC is an eye-opener. It’s pleasant to see that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other ministers focussed on the subject. I have attended many forums in different parts of the country and abroad. In most of the events, the presence of politicians deviated from the subject of the event but here all remained focused on water,” said GI expert Dr Rajnikant while expressing his experience of attending TWC. The context setting presentation by Prof Venkatesh Dutta in the inaugural session of TWC was followed by the addresses of UP minister of state for Jal Shakti and flood control Dinesh Khatik and UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and religious affairs Neelkanth Tiwari, who explained how the upcoming tourism projects are being linked with ecological and water tourism. In the next three sessions, experts presented details on a clean Ganga, groundwater, wetlands and other issues. Before the CM’s address, his cabinet colleague and UP Jal Shakti minister Dr Mahendra Singh highlighted the work being done in the state for improving the condition of water resources. The TWC came to an end with cultural events performed by local music artistes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/twc-mulls-a-sustainable-water-roadmap-for-state/articleshow/86852243.cms||---

---||Delhi||Let juniors visit schools once a week: Plea to Delhi LG||NEW DELHI: Over 60 parents of students studying in the lower classes in private schools have made a representation to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking permission to allow their children to visit school at least once a week for music and fitness sessions and for educational and recreational activities. Three mothers, whose children have missed 550 days of school till Thursday since the Covid-19 outbreak, started this initiative and were joined by others similarly inclined. The letter to the LG says, “Primary and middle schools have been closed for 1.5 years in Delhi, the third longest school closure in the world behind those in Uganda and Nepal as per UNESCO data. The cost to children's health of remaining at home is extremely high (especially for younger kids). Given that everything else in Delhi is open (and crowded), Covid cases are at a historic low, and DDMA has even permitted festive gatherings, reopening schools should become a priority.” At present, students of classes IX -XII are attending school. Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), of which the LG is the chairman, has said it would consider reopening for other classes after the ongoing festive season.  The representation to the LG says, “There are abundant reports of health problems among children –physical health issues such as rickets, eyesight issues, decreased attention spans, disrupted sleep routines, anxiety, anger/aggression, depression, mood swings, psychological trauma, and emotional dysregulation. Reduced physical activity is leading to problems such as low muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness, slow metabolism, obesity and eye problems." Tanya Aggarwal, lawyer and mother of a Class I student, said, “As an interim measure, students of up to Class VIII should be allowed to attend schools at least once a week for music, fitness and other educational or recreational activities. These can be conducted in well-ventilated spaces, subject to Covid protocols.” Dharini Mathur, another lawyer and mother of a KG student, added, “For primary school children, long-term denial of social play could potentially be a precursor to social isolation, loneliness, and serious developmental issues." The parents are questioning the hesitancy of the government in reopening the schools for lower classes when domain experts, including from AIIMS, ICMR, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, Niti Aayog, UNICEF and WHO have spoken in favour of opening schools. Simran Khara, startup founder whose kid studies in Class I, said, “Media reports say the Delhi education department has found, consistent with worldwide evidence, that reopening of classes IX-XII since September 1 hasn’t led to a surge in Covid cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/let-juniors-visit-schools-once-a-week-plea-to-lg/articleshow/86850325.cms||Shradha Chettri

In Dhariawad, speculations were that the BJP would field the candidate keeping in consideration the sympathy wave. To everyone’s surprise, the ticket was given to Khet Singh Meena. Kanhaiya Meena, son of former MLA Gautam Meena who was considered a strong contender was denied ticket. Supporters of Kanhaiya gathered in large numbers at his house in Lasadiya and shouted slogans against the system. The supporters alleged that if Kanhaiya was denied ticket by BJP on grounds of discouraging dynasty politics, then why was Dipti Maheshwari, daughter of former MLA Kiran Maheshwari, given ticket from Rajsamand. Kanhaiya is expected to file his nomination as an independent candidate. In Dhariawad, after the Congress denied ticket to Nathulal Meena, he filed his nomination as an independent. Randhir Singh Bhinder of Janata Sena and his wife Deependra Kunwar, too, filed their nominations from Vallabhnagar as independent candidates. Deependra was expecting a ticket from the BJP.

---||Jaipur||Cong, BJP declare candidates for Vallabhnagar, Dhariawad||Jaipur: A day ahead of the last date for filing nominations, Congress and BJP declared their candidates for Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad assembly bypolls on Thursday, much on expected lines. From Vallabhnagar seat, Congress has nominated Preeti Shaktawat, wife of late MLA Gajendra Singh Shaktawat, while BJP has picked Himmat Singh Jhala, a local businessman. Gajendra’s brother Devendra Shaktawat, who was seeking a Congress ticket, might oppose Preeti in the election. From Dhariawad, a seat reserved for scheduled tribe (ST) candidates, Congress has nominated Nagraj Meena, a two-term ex-MLA, while BJP has selected Khet Singh Meena, a former sarpanch. Both candidates have already started facing opposition within their own parties from aspirants who failed to get tickets.In nominating Jhala from Vallabhnagar, BJP has tried to avoid upsetting former chief minister Vasundhara Raje and Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria. Raje was supporting former MLA Randhir Singh Bhinder, while Kataria wanted the ticket for Udai Lal Dangi, said sources. Bhinder, who finished second with over 62,000 votes in the 2018 assembly election, is likely to remain a formidable opponent for both the Congress and BJP candidates in the bypoll too. Both Bhinder and his wife have filed nominations as independent candidates from the constituency. Congress candidate Preeti would depend on the sympathy factor for her late husband who was the sitting legislator till January this year. BJP candidate Jhala has been associated with RSS but is relatively new to politics. He was active in helping people during Covid pandemic in association with Chittorgarh MP CP Joshi. In Dhariawad, BJP has preferred a veteran in Khet Singh Meena, who has been active in panchayat politics since 1995. He was a sarpanch twice and, currently, his wife is a sarpanch. Late legislator Gautam Lal Meena’s son Kanhaiya Lal Meena was among the ticket contenders hoping for sympathy votes, but the party picked up an old timer supported by Kataria. MLA Gautam Lal Meena, who died of Covid infection in May this year, was from the Raje camp. The Congress, too, has fielded a veteran from Dhariawad. Nagraj Meena, who would be contesting the election for the fifth time in a row, has been a legislator twice in 1998 and 2008. He, however, faces opposition within his party since the Congress has been repeating him despite the voters rejecting him thrice, two times in a row in 2013 and 2018). In the run up to the candidate selection, Congressmen from Dhariawad met party senior leaders seeking opportunity for a fresh candidate. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, his former deputy Sachin Pilot, AICC general secretary Ajay Maken and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra would be addressing election rallies at Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad when Congress candidates file their nominations on Friday. BJP candidates would also file their nominations in the presence of party senior leaders on Friday. Voting would be held on October 30 and results would be out on November 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-bjp-declare-candidates-for-vallabhnagar-dhariawad/articleshow/86852262.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC re-tenders works worth Rs 1,200 crore for roads across Mumbai||MUMBAI: The BMC on Thursday re-tendered road works worth close to Rs 1,200 crore in cement-concrete, asphalt and mastic asphalt. These works had been red-flagged by the department head last month after road contractors quoted up to 30% below estimates. Officials said that in the coming days roads in Mhada layouts will also be tendered for repairs and the total cost of road repair works are expected to cross Rs 2,000 crore. On Thursday, the tenders were invited under three different categories for roads in eastern and western suburbs and city areas. The BMC gave interested parties time till October 28 to fill in their bids. Corporators said they feared that with the stringent conditions that are being laid this time, if interested parties seek an extension in filling of bids the road works are only likely to be delayed. A civic official said that several key tender conditions have been modified in the new tenders, like contractors who take part in the tenders must have previous road work experience instead of having any civil work experience. “Similarly, it has been mandatory for contractors to sign memorandum of understanding (MoU) with owners of ready mix concrete (RMC), asphalt and mastic asphalt plants. The contractors will have to give an MOU for machinery and equipment with the plant owners. There will also be deferred payment. Only 80% of payment will be released when the work is completed. The remaining 20% payment will be released during the defect liability period (DLP) in instalments,” the BMC’s modifications to the tender conditions read. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said that the BMC had tweaked the tender conditions to favour the old cartel of contractors. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects) said that the 80:20 deferred payment is to ensure quality. “Twenty per cent will be paid on 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th year after checking the quality of roads each year. Undertaking with material suppliers is to ensure the suppliers supply the designated grade of material. Undertaking can be given within one week of opening financial bids,” said Velrasu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-re-tenders-works-worth-rs-1200cr-for-roads-across-city/articleshow/86852264.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||Cong tops ZP, PS by-polls due to Kedar’s aggressive push||Nagpur: Aggressive campaigning by Maharashtra animal husbandry and dairy development minister Sunil Kedar helped Congress sweep the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti by-polls held on Tuesday and strengthen its position. The results were declared on Wednesday. Congress won nine seats and BJP only three. Overall, Congress improved its tally by two seats, while BJP lost one seat as compared to earlier elections. In PS polls, Congress won 21 seats while the BJP could manage just six. The saffron party was expected to do better on the issue of cancellation of OBC reservations by the Supreme Court, which it blamed on the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. It also pointed fingers towards the MVA constituents – Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP – for failure to defend Maratha reservation in the apex court. None of the party’s bigwigs took the polls seriously or campaigned for its contestants, unlike Congress leaders led by Kedar. As per the poll analysts, this is yet another setback for BJP stalwarts like Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on their home turf, even as efforts were made to revive the party after the 2019 assembly election debacle. Both leaders did not address even a single rally during the entire campaigning, said BJP workers, who claimed that it was one of the reasons for the party’s poor performance. Congress’s old ally, the NCP, also suffered as its tally was reduced by two seats. Analysts attributed the loss to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, who was missing from the campaign due to the alleged extortion case against him lodged by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). BJP’s friend-turned-foe Shiv Sena was once again rejected by the voters, as the Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit failed to open its account despite contesting all 16 seats. In comparison, smaller outfits like the Gondwana Republican Party (GRP) and the Peasant Workers Party (PWP) maintained their existence by grabbing one seat each. Congress workers attributed the party’s success to Kedar, who led the campaigning from the front and laid emphasis on personal relations with voters. Even MPCC chief Nana Patole, district president Rajendra Mulak and Nana Gawande helped the contestants by addressing some rallies. The BJP's campaign was led by state general secretary Chandrasekhar Bawankule, MLA Sameer Meghe, MLC Parinay Fuke and district president Arvind Gajbhiye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-tops-zp-ps-by-polls-due-to-kedars-aggressive-push/articleshow/86847966.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Jaipur police commissionerate cited the home department’s order issued on July 10 which prohibited all kinds of rallies, processions, cultural events etc in the state. “Ahead of the festive season, we had reiterated the home department’s circular that clearly banned all gatherings, whether religious or political. If anyone is still found to be flouting the norms, then strict action will be taken against them,” an official said. Jaipur police, however, did not explain why protests and dharnas were allowed to take place in the past few days despite prohibitory orders being in place. An official admitted that monitoring the entire city for violators was not “feasible”. “We had told all police stations to inform cultural and social associations in their areas that they have to abide by the pandemic protocol. But if someone is still caught with a violation then legal action will be taken. However, we cant not deploy cops in every colony, people also need to follow guidelines for their safety,” the official claimed.

---||Thane||Even as Mumbai schools open gates, classrooms see more absentees||MUMBAI: While 78% aided and unaided schools in the city have reopened from Monday, student strength has not crossed 22%. Civic schools that got good response from students on day one, too saw a dip a day later. Education officials have urged schools to ensure those who started their physical schooling continue to go to their classrooms. Parents who have not given consent are also being persuaded to reconsider their decisions. Students attending civic schools in the city dropped by 24% on Tuesday. On Monday, when schools reopened after 18 months of closure, 30,250 class 8-10 students were present. In aided and unaided schools, of the 7.27 lakh higher secondary students, only 1.78 lakh are attending physical schools. With class 11 and 12 students unable to travel to their colleges due to unavailability of trains, junior colleges are continuing with online teaching. Across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, urban areas of Thane have managed to reopen 63% of schools that have 40% or 1.14 lakh higher secondary students. Rural Palghar that had been at the forefront of schools reopening in July, saw a poor response of 15% from urban students in getting back to schools. In the state too, urban schools have not been able to attract more than 35% students to class. Almost 99% of schools in urban areas of Nashik division have now reopened, but the student strength is just 39%. In Kolhapur, all schools in rural and urban areas have reopened with 86% and 68% students from rural and urban areas attending, while in Sangli, 100% schools from classes 5-12 have reopened and 85% students are attending. Principals said physical attendance is likely to go up by mid-November when schools reopen after the Diwali vacation. Schools will shut for Diwali from October 30 to November 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-even-as-city-schools-open-gates-classrooms-see-more-absentees/articleshow/86855897.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Jaipur||Monsoon begins to withdraw from western Rajasthan||JAIPUR: South-west monsoon, which already had a month-long extended spell, now withdrawn from western Rajasthan. On Thursday, Jaipur Met office stated that monsoon will completely withdraw from the state by the next week. The extended spell has cleared all the deficit of rainfall in the state as majority of the districts have recorded a surplus rainfall. TOI on Thursday spoke to the authorities of the Jaipur Met office to know how monsoon fared in the state so far and on the changes in the climatic conditions. Rajasthan usually gets an average rainfall of 521mm but this year so far a rainfall of 588.82 mm has been received. “The state so far has received almost 12% higher rainfall compared to last year which is good for the state. It has also given new lease of life to the water reservoirs as majority of the dams and reservoirs in the state are almost full to the capacity,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. However, the south-west monsoon has started withdrawing from the state and from the western Rajasthan it is completely been vanished. “The rising humidity levels which are catalysts for the monsoon rainfall are dipping continuously. The humidity levels in the state are on and below 65% in the state which shows that monsoon has started withdrawing. By the next week it will completely vanish from the state except for some rainfall that may occur due to the upcoming cyclonic circulation,” the officer added. Winters have also started creeping in at some places in the state as Sikar remained coldest in the state with a minimum temperature of 19°C. A dip of almost 3°C was witnessed at many places in the state. In Jaipur a minimum temperature of 25°C was recorded which was 3 degrees above the normal notch. In its forecast, Jaipur Met office stated that the weather would mainly remain dry in the state in the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-begins-to-withdraw-from-western-raj/articleshow/86852280.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Panellists: Forge a bond with rivers, curb overexploitation of groundwater||LUCKNOW: If we want to save and rejuvenate rivers, it is important that we develop a sense of ownership of rivers and stop overexploitation of groundwater. We will have to come out of the notion of ‘jal aseemit hai’ (water is unlimited) if we want potable water in future. These views were expressed by scientists, hydrologists and stakeholders at the ‘Make UP A Water Positive State’ initiative. Experts said that conservation of wetlands and real-time monitoring of water supply in the state is the need of the hour. “It’s important to build a sense of ownership and pride for rivers among the people. Namami Gange campaign is based on four pillars – ‘nirmal Ganga’ (unpolluted Ganga) wherein the focus is on solid waste management and rural sanitization, ‘aviral Ganga’ where work is carried out on ecology and flow, ‘jan Ganga’ under which people’s connection is established with the river, and ‘gyan Ganga’ which works towards research, policy and knowledge management,” said executive director (projects), National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) Ashok Kumar Singh. “Under Namami Gange, we have achieved success in rejuvenating the river by working on these four pillars. The common perception that we have unlimited availability of water needs to be changed. People must understand that we have limited water resources and that too are polluted,” said director, UP State Groundwater Board, VK Upadhyay. He said every three years, the UP groundwater department conducts an assessment of groundwater in 10 cities which have a population of more than 10 lakh. The assessment of Aligarh, Moradabad, Bareilly, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Ghaziabad, Agra, Meerut, Lucknow and Kanpur revealed that groundwater situation in these cities is alarming. Director, Rivers, Wetlands & Water Policy, WWF India, Suresh Babu, emphasized on the importance of wetland conservation. “We have roped in Wetland Mitras, student volunteers who have done a wonderful job by conducting surveys and making a checklist. Water budgeting (measuring the quantity of water entering and leaving a system) and minimizing the loss of wetlands can make us water sufficient,” he said. Programme officer, Centre for Science & Environment (CSE), Dhruv Pasricha said urbanization was inevitable and urban built-up area had increased drastically in UP leading to an increase in water demand across sectors. “This has resulted in stretches of rivers with non-existent flow, overexploited aquifers, urban lakes and ponds which are being encroached upon. This has left an alarming impact on both quantity and quality of water. There is a need to protect local water bodies for supplementary resources, and stormwater management in public places should be promoted,” he added. Team leader, WASH, Tata Trust, Pankaj Papnoi said monitoring of water consumption could help in improving the water management system. “Real time monitoring can be effectively done by using advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IOTs),” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/panellists-forge-a-bond-with-rivers-curb-overexploitation-of-groundwater/articleshow/86853870.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Varanasi||Community must lead, administration should follow||Varanasi: Contrary to the thought that the administrative machinery must work to mobilise social changes, the community must lead and officials should follow to ensure sustainability of the idea, its effective implementation and maintenance of the system evolved. This was the key takeaway from the post lunch session of the event, which was dedicated to the role of community in water conservation. In this, models and community leaders from different parts of Uttar Pradesh shared their prototypes with the vision that it may show the way to others. To bring out the best from these case studies, a panel of experts comprising Prof Prabhat K. Singh, department of civil engineering, IIT-BHU, Farrukh Khan, technical specialist, WaterAid and Prof Venkatesh Dutta, faculty, School of Earth Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University moderated the session and gathered the takeaways. Real life stories from Gonda, Barabanki and Siddhartnagar were used to speak about the need, potential and role of the community in water conservation by Nagendra P Singh, WASH specialist, Unicef UP in the opening session. He spoke at length that the community needs to be convinced about something to embrace the cause and commit their contribution in it. Former district magistrate of Banda, Heera Lal shared how only community can translate vision into action. Citing his journey in this parched Bundlelkhand district, Heera Lal — presently serving as additional mission director National Health Mission UP — said that his biggest learning was that contrary to the belief that officers lead campaigns, it is community that is the true harbinger of change. “Banda’s story of change became a model because people took it forward… as a system or as the administrative leader of the district (read DM), we can just be facilitators,” he said. Recalling Mahatama Gandhi’s thought that empowering women accelerated social change, Sanjay Singh, national convenor of the Jan Jal Jodo Abhiyan, shared the story of Jal Saheli — women committed to water conservation in the parched Bundelkhand. Presently active in 93 villages, the Jal Sahelis work on all aspects of water conservation which has also made their own lives simpler. Stating that water conservation required indirect methods as well, Prof. VK Tripathi, department of Agricultural Engineering, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University spoke about what farmers can do to save water. Citing precision irrigation as the means, he said that switching from traditional irrigation methods to drip irrigation can help in irrigating larger area, increase crop yield, enhance nutrient efficiency to as high as 90%. The session concluded with the thought that water security was directly linked to food security and both the elements were crucial to human survival which makes community participation indispensable. The thoughts on this were presented by Mohd Afjal Ahmad, UN Awardee on Water Cooperation and assistant professor in department of physiology, institute of agricultural sciences, BHU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/community-must-lead-administration-should-follow/articleshow/86852282.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Even as Mumbai schools open gates, classrooms see more absentees||MUMBAI: While 78% aided and unaided schools in the city have reopened from Monday, student strength has not crossed 22%. Civic schools that got good response from students on day one, too saw a dip a day later. Education officials have urged schools to ensure those who started their physical schooling continue to go to their classrooms. Parents who have not given consent are also being persuaded to reconsider their decisions. Students attending civic schools in the city dropped by 24% on Tuesday. On Monday, when schools reopened after 18 months of closure, 30,250 class 8-10 students were present. In aided and unaided schools, of the 7.27 lakh higher secondary students, only 1.78 lakh are attending physical schools. With class 11 and 12 students unable to travel to their colleges due to unavailability of trains, junior colleges are continuing with online teaching. Across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, urban areas of Thane have managed to reopen 63% of schools that have 40% or 1.14 lakh higher secondary students. Rural Palghar that had been at the forefront of schools reopening in July, saw a poor response of 15% from urban students in getting back to schools. In the state too, urban schools have not been able to attract more than 35% students to class. Almost 99% of schools in urban areas of Nashik division have now reopened, but the student strength is just 39%.

---||Visakhapatnam||Rising fuel prices hit transport sector hard in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: The rising fuel prices have come as a blow to the freight transport sector in the state, particularly in the north Andhra districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. The stakeholders say over 50% of their income is spent on fuel due to the continuous rise in its prices. Closure of some companies, like Ferro Alloys and the jute mills in the region have also hit the transport sector hard. Lorry owners of Salur town in Vizianagaram district, which is one of the major road transport hubs in the state after Vijayawada, say they are struggling to pay even salaries to their workers. G Madhava Rao, secretary of Salur lorry owners association, said while the price of diesel has increased by over 30% since March 2020 and has now touched Rs 100 per litre, the fright charges have remained the same as customers are not willing to pay more. “For instance, freight charge per tonne from Vizianagaram district to Raipur in Chhattisgarh has remained Rs 1,300 for the past two years despite several hikes in fuel prices. Many lorry owners have decided to sell their vehicles and quit the business altogether as it is no more sustainable,” Rao told TOI. Same is the situation in Vizag. “The increase in fuel prices and decrease in construction activities have hit the industry hard. When the real estate sector is active, it boosts freight activities due to transport of cement, iron, electrical, and plumbing material. But the sector is dull in the region. The pandemic has shattered our business. We have not handled any new vehicles since the lockdown. We are struggling to even pay salary to our workers. The situation is only getting worse by the day,” said Arjun, secretary of Visakhapatnam lorry owners association. To add to people’s woes, vegetable prices have also spiralled across the state due to incessant rains which have caused widespread damage to the crops. The massive demand-supply mismatch has led to prices of vegetables increasing by nearly 30% in the last few days. A vast stretch of vegetable farms, which supply veggies to wholesale and retails market across the state, were inundated in the aftermath of cyclone Gulab in the last two weeks of September. “Standing vegetable crops in hundreds of acres were damaged due to continuous rains. We are not getting sufficient quantities which has led to the rise in prices,” said GK Naidu, a wholesaler at Gnanapuram market in the city. The demand-supply mismatch may continue till November-end on account of Karthika masam, the auspicious month during which a majority of people stay off non-veg food. “Low quality items are coming to the markets but the prices are high. Tomatoes are being sold at Rs Rs 36 per kg in rythu bazaars and around Rs Rs 40-50 in the retail markets. Same is the case with onions. Nagpur, Solapur, and Ahmednagar onions are being sold at Rs Rs 40-45 in the retail markets,” says Y Madhu Babu, a local vegetable vendor. In fact, the prices of most of the vegetables, which were being sold between Rs 20 to Rs 40 a few days back, have more than double in the last one week. The state caters to nearly 11.8 per cent of the country’s total vegetable production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rising-fuel-prices-hit-transport-sector-hard/articleshow/86852286.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Kanpur||Manish Gupta case: SIT recordsstatements of wife, two friends||Kanpur: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has initiated a probe in Kanpur, the home district of businessman Manish Gupta, who allegedly died due to police torture during a raid at a hotel located in Ramgarh Tal, Gorakhpur, recently. The second team of SIT, led by DCP South Raveena Tyagi, arrived at Manish’s house in Barra on Wednesday and recorded the statements of his two friends, residents of Gurugram who went with Manish to Gorakhpur, besides his wife Meenakshi in the presence of police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun. The recording of the statement started at 1 pm and continued till late evening. On the day of the incident, Manish was accompanied to Gorakhpur by his two friends Harbir Singh and Pradeep Kumar, both residents of Gurugram. The police commissioner also reached Manish’s house along with the SIT. In his presence, verbal statements of both the key witnesses and wife Meenakshi were recorded. During this video clipping was also prepared. After this, the process of recording the written statements of the three was started. Manish’s friends, however, refused to talk to the media. Meenakshi’s written statement was recorded in 15 pages by SIT. Meenakshi told reporters that the SIT has questioned her on several points. “Like, the police questioned about the developments after Manish went to Gorakhpur. Many other questions were asked including when did I came to know about the incident, about my going to Gorakhpur from Kanpur, about meeting with persons in Gorakhpur, what were their answers with regard to queries made by me,” said Meenakshi. On the question of how satisfied she is with the investigation of the SIT, Meenakshi said that it would be too early to say anything. “At present, the investigation is going on. Let the final report come, only then one can draw conclusion over the SIT probe,” she said. Sources informed TOI that Harbir and Pradeep were summoned by the SIT to reach Gorakhpur to record a statement, but the two did not reach there. “They told the SIT that they did not trust the Gorakhpur police, that’s why they didn’t go there. When they were asked to come to Kanpur, they agreed,” added sources further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/manish-gupta-case-sit-recordsstatements-of-wife-two-friends/articleshow/86852304.cms||---

During questioning, he has admitted that all the videos which have gone viral were of his, SIT sources said. “However, he is not ready to accept that what he did was wrong. On being asked, he narrated the verses of the holy Quran to the officers and said, tell me what is wrong in this. What he said is all written in the Quran,” they added. All throughout questioning he, however, tried his best to deny the allegations against him. To recall, the state government had on Tuesday last ordered a probe by Special Investigating Team (SIT) into the videos that went viral on the social media wherein Mohammad Iftikharuddin, presently posted as chairman of UPSRTC, can be seen telling people benefits of adopting Islam as a religion. The video is said to be a religious event that took place when IAS was posted as divisional commissioner, Kanpur. The videos also feature a religious leader sitting beside the IAS officer. In another video, Iftikharuddin is seen sitting on the ground while a Muslim speaker is purportedly giving radical lessons at his residence. The government took serious cognizance of the videos and sought a report within seven days for the formation of a two-member SIT headed by director general CB-CID GL Meena and ADG Zone Bhanu Bhaskar. The SIT on Wednesday last visited Kanpur and stayed for four days and collected the controversial videos, around 80 in number. About 30 people were questioned, including the employees of the divisional commissioner’s office and residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ias-officer-in-conversionrow-appears-before-sit/articleshow/86852326.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NIT rejects part occupancy certificate to Glocal Square Mall||Nagpur: Glocal Square Mall, a multi-storey shopping mall coming up in Sitabuldi has violated the sanctioned plan. Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has rejected its request to issue part occupancy certificate citing 14 discrepancies in the building. Even though NIT has not issued any certificate, many shops in the mall have already started operating. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) too had started a drive-in Covid-19 vaccination centre in the building’s parking area. Even Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) too has come under scanner for launching at this mall the first lactation cuboid, a dedicated pink cabin, to help lactating mothers feed children while out shopping, at the mall. The cuboid was inaugurated by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari. TOI has been highlighting and exposing several violations in the construction of the mall since beginning. Sources said NIT’s refusal came after several complaints of irregularities and violations of sanctioned plan of the mall by civic activists. One of the major violations is that the construction for which the part occupancy certificate was sought, is not yet complete in all respects. Store rooms have been constructed in the basement of the parking space, says the NIT letter issued to Goyal Ganga Infrastructure and Real Estate Private Limited. Sources pointed out that the construction firm had allegedly misled NMC’s fire and emergency services department. It had shown height of the building as 22.5 meter to avail relaxation in firefighting arrangements. The fire department also issued no-objection certificates on July 22 this year. But in reality, the height of the building is above 25 meter, NIT observed in its refusal report. Sources also pointed out that as per one of the conditions, the construction firm was supposed to rehabilitate shopkeepers outside its vicinity. Unless it shifts them it would not be able to show a refuge area, which is mandatory for firefighting compliance. Even provision of rain water harvesting is not provided at the site. Sewage network plan showing proper sewage network duly signed by the concerned architect along with the calculation of sewage disposal too was not submitted. The construction firm has also failed to submit a structural stability certificate. Another grave violation NIT team found is that the mall has started the elevator without a lift installation certificate issued from the electrical department of public works department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-rejects-part-occupancy-certificate-to-glocal-square-mall/articleshow/86848012.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Member of the redressal commission Rajendra Singh in his order stated that flight operator IndiGo had to pay Rs 35 lakhs as compensation, Rs 50 lakhs for mental agony and harassment and Rs 50,000 as the cost of the case along with interest at the rate of 10% per annum. One Vinay Kumar Tiwari had booked an air ticket from Lucknow to Delhi through Cleartrip on April 15, 2013. His PNR no. was ERBVLS of IndiGo Flight no. 6 E -141 while the departure time was 10.50 a.m. He reached Amausi airport and checked in the flight and occupied his allotted seat No. 5 A. Just before the take-off, the cabin crew of IndiGo informed him that his ticket had been cancelled and rudely deported him from the flight at Amausi airport. Tiwari inquired from Cleartrip and was informed that on their side there was no cancellation of the ticket. Further inquiry from IndiGo revealed that one Shailendra had cancelled the ticket in the morning at 7.38 a.m. The state commission held that if it was presumed that the ticket was cancelled at 7.38 a.m., then why did they allow Tiwari to check in the flight. IndiGo airlines neither submitted the mobile number of the said person nor a screenshot of any message to Tiwari. After going through the entire circumstances and evidence on record, the state commission reached to the conclusion that there was a deficiency in service by IndiGo airlines and it also committed unfair trade practice with a contractor of national fame, who was going to attend an urgent meeting at Delhi. Thereafter, the state commission awarded total compensation of Rs 85,50,000 with interest at the rate of 10% per annum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/consumer-panel-orders-airlines-topay-rs-85-50l-for-cancelled-ticket/articleshow/86852337.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Give Rs 10 lakh payout to woman for burns in domestic violence case: Bombay HC to Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Holding that the compensation scheme for acid attack victims can be extended to others who suffer disfigurement caused by other corrosive substances, the Bombay high court has directed the Maharashtra government to pay out a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to a Dahisar woman who was a victim of burns more than a decade ago. In 2010, the woman, a victim of domestic violence (DV), said her husband poured “boiling inflammable corrosive substance on her face and body”. She suffered almost 80% superficial to deep burns on her face and body. This year, through advocate Aditi Saxena, she approached the HC for financial support under the state’s Manodhairya scheme and rehabilitation, on par with acid attack victims. Having spent more than Rs 5 lakh and with no more funds, she was unable to get further medical treatment for the burns, said Saxena. The HC bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar, accepting the submissions, held that the legislature has not confined disfigurement due to violent assaults by throwing of acid only. The bench said the law includes disfigurement caused by other corrosive substances as well and hence a socio-beneficial provision of compensation to such victims or survivors “can be extended to persons suffering similar attacks and need not be confined to the strict chemical definition of ‘acid’”. Under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, an acid attack victim will be a person suffering from a specified disability. Here, too, the term “acid attack victim” has been defined to mean a person disfigured due to violent assaults by throwing of acid or a similar corrosive substance, said the high court. It added by the use of the expression “similar corrosive substance”, the legislative intent is quite clear. The disability should not be confined to disfigurement by throwing of acid only; such disfigurement could be due to throwing of similar corrosive substance. The HC also directed the secretary of the Mumbai District Legal Services Authority, through himself or a para legal volunteer, to ensure that the women get all other benefits, such as disability registration, further compensation in terms of NALSA scheme, Prime Minister’s Relief Fund and Central Victim Compensation Fund Guidelines, 2016, and free medical treatment, including for additional or reconstructive surgery, and to ensure that all rehabilitative measures are made available to them in law. “It is evidently clear from the materials on record, including the judgment of the criminal court, that boiling inflammable corrosive substance was poured on the face and body of the petitioner. As per the statement of the medical officer in the criminal trial, the petitioner had suffered 70% to 80% superficial to deep burns on her face and body. The petitioner has stated on oath which has not been denied that she had spent more than Rs 5 lakh in Masina Hospital, Mumbai, for her treatment but because of absolute financial constraints she is unable to undergo further medical treatment including reconstructive surgery,” said the high court. The court also directed her husband to have no access to her fixed deposits and savings bank account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-state-give-rs-10l-payout-to-woman-for-burns-in-dv-case/articleshow/86852365.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi HC takes dim note of ‘unfortunate state of affairs’ at LNJP||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Thursday sought the Delhi government’s response on a petition alleging an “unfortunate state of affairs” at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital (LNJP) and said it needed to “gear up”. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice on a petition by a former patient and asked the government to set out steps to improve the working of the hospital. “This is not the first time that we are hearing it,” the judge remarked as she expressed displeasure over the alleged lapses. “Some of this (allegations) must be true. I don’t want to doubt him. He is not in the business (of medicine). There is no competition. There are limitations, but you need to gear up,” she added after the petitioner claimed several irregularities. The petitioner claimed that no Covid-19 test was conducted at the time of his admission, there were two-three patients on each bed and three people were taken to the ultrasound lab at a time. His lawyer also alleged that “bodies were lying on bed for 15-20 hours” while patients were on the floor. “We are not out of Covid. Every day ministers are saying please take care. This is so-called one of your prestigious hospitals. I expect the hospital to gear up now,” the judge said. The Delhi government sought time to file a response on the petition where it has also been prayed that the court set up a high-powered committee to look into and monitor various lapses at LNJP and take necessary action at the earliest. The plea alleged that the hospital authorities had a “careless, callous and unbothered attitude”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-takes-dim-note-of-unfortunate-state-of-affairs-at-lnjp/articleshow/86850420.cms||---

The bench of Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasuriya, which heard a batch of petitions challenging the mortgage of government properties for getting loans for APSDC, found fault with the terms and conditions included in the loan documents giving powers to the banks to issue notices to the governor in case the state government fails to repay the loan. “The governor is protected from civil and criminal cases as per Article 361 of the Indian Constitution. How can the state government remove that right?” the bench asked. The court also raised objection on inclusion of the governor’s name in the loan agreement, asking the government whether the same person would continue as governor forever. Senior counsel Dushyant Dave, appearing for the state government, argued that the petitions are not maintainable as they are filed with a political motive. The petitioners are obstructing the state from taking loans by writing representations to banks, he said, to which the court asked why banks are hesitating to fund this project when everything is correct. Petitioner and MLA Velagapudi Ramakrishna submitted to the court that the state mortgaged several properties in Visakhapatnam while the petition is pending for hearing in the court. He sought directions seeking not to mortgage any other properties of the state till further orders. The court directed the state to file counter and posted the next hearing of the matter to October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-quizzes-govt-over-seeking-loans-for-apsdc/articleshow/86852349.cms||Venu Lanka

NGOs were welcomed to be part of the ‘Mission Kawach Kundal’ to be held across the state for giving impetus to the vaccination drive. The mission will be held between October 8 and 14. The meeting was held in the backdrop of the formation of the GO-NGO coordination committee at the district-level for a better ‘connect’. Around 50 NGOs participated in the meeting chaired by collector R Vimala who was flanked by resident district collector Vijaya Bankar, district disaster management officer Ankush Gawande, district health officer (DHO) Dr Deepak Shelokar and others. Vimala R said the meeting was prompted by a suggestion from the state disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department for nurturing a more proactive and productive communication with the NGOs during crisis or any other emergencies like Covid. The collector said that several issues of coordination and communication were discussed in which NGOs can more effectively participate. “One of the issues focused on roping in NGOs for stepping up the vaccination drive,” she said. She said adding women self-help groups could be the best medium for spreading awareness about the vaccination drive at grassroots level. During a presentation, DHO Dr Shelokar informed that 72% of eligible population in the district has taken the first dose while 31% are fully vaccinated. In the talukas, 68% has taken the first dose while 23% both the doses. The vaccine coverage has reduced from 29,011 on September 22 to 12,390 on October 6. Devendra Kshirsagar of Sahyadri Foundation said that NGOs have been urged to motivate people at the grassroots level for vaccination. “Vehicles for pregnant woman and elderly would be provided for home pick up and drop but NGOs can play crucial role in facilitating such drives,” he said adding that the district administration is aiming at vagabond and homeless people too for vaccine cover. District disaster management officer Gawande said the NGOs can play role of facilitators to help implement government schemes and reach out to people. “NGOs can play a multifaceted role between government and the citizens,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngos-urged-to-boost-govt-efforts-to-improve-vax-coverage/articleshow/86848080.cms||Soumitra Bose

In his context setting presentation, Dutta emphasised on five Ps — Principles, People, Processes, Practices and Policies — for making UP a water positive state. Elaborating on each P, he said that Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is the key as much as the water positive minds. “There is a need for community oriented practices and participatory and collaborative approach for water resource management to happen,” he said. UP has eight large river basins and rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Rapti, Ghaghra, Gandak, Gomti and others. But, at the same time, it has many challenges which need to be addressed to make it a water positive state. “There is a need to focus on coarse grains and less water-intensive crops like pulses. Bundelkhand was known as a bowl of pulses,” he said. There is also a need to focus on use and reuse of waste water. Dutta suggested engagement of a range of stakeholders, bridging the knowledge gaps, coherence of policies and coordination among the departments as a way forward. UP has already implemented schemes like ‘Har Ghar Jal’ scheme and taken up initiatives like using solar power to supply water in 66 districts besides reviving the lost and endangered rivers. “These are success stories,” said Dutta. The government is also working on flood protection mechanisms, desilting of canals, encouraging people to dig their own ponds in their farms and on telling people to use precise irrigation practices to conserve water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/5ps-mantra-to-make-up-a-water-positive-reservoir/articleshow/86853911.cms||Neha Shukla

The leopard attacked cattle in the shed located on the forest fringe, killed two calves and took away the carcass of one, the forest officials said. “We were informed about the incident by local farmers who noticed in the morning that one of the calves was missing. When the farmers went in search for the missing calf sighted the leopard,” said V Venkateshwar Rao, district forest official, Sangareddy. The forest officials who are monitoring the movement of the leopard have assured compensation to the farmers for the loss. The farmers, however, demanded that the officials set up trap cages to capture the leopard to avoid more such incidents in future. In a similar incident last month, a calf was killed at Kadpal village of Sangareddy district. The forest officials who inspected the area identified the pug marks of a leopard at the site. Farmers from Nagadhara, Krishnapur in Kalher Mandal and Khajapur village in Sirgapur Mandal also reported spotting a leopard in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/leopard-strikes-in-sangareddykills-2-calves-in-cattle-shed/articleshow/86850431.cms||---

The 50-year-old Kalaben will be contesting the election for the first time. On Thursday, Kalaben and her son Abhinav, along with supporters met Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai before her name was declared. “We had approached Shiv Sena for support and after discussion, the party has agreed to declare my mother as their candidate,” Abhinav told TOI. “I will work for the people of DNH with the same spirit as my husband. I will continue the development work in DNH as my husband had dreamt about,” said Kalaben, who is Bachelor in Arts (BA). Delkar was a strongest tribal leader who managed to win the election from different parties and also as an independent candidate. He was probably the only leader from the UT who contested from both BJP, Congress and won. The seven-time MP from DNH Delkar had died by suicide at a Mumbai hotel in February this year. His death had raked up a row in the political circles. The DNH Lok Sabha constituency has remained an important seat for all top political parties. Currently, former minister in Narendra Modi’s government in Gujarat, Praful Patel is the administrator of the UT. It will be the first election for the parliamentary seat after the unification of Diu, Daman and DNH as one UT, which now has two parliamentary seats. Meanwhile, BJP announced Mahesh Gavit (44) as their candidate from DNH seat on Thursday. Gavit was formerly a sub-inspector in the Indian Reserve Battalion and had resigned in 2014 to join politics. He served as office bearer in the party and is contesting for the first time in the parliamentary election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/late-mp-mohan-delkars-wife-to-contest-from-dnh/articleshow/86848160.cms||---

This monsoon, over 430 people died, and crop losses were reported on over 40 lakh hectares across Maharashtra. The state also sought financial assistance from the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-farmers-to-get-rs-rs-365cr-in-flood-relief-from-state/articleshow/86853957.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Way forward: Community must lead, administration should follow||Varanasi: Contrary to the thought that the administrative machinery must work to mobilise social changes, the community must lead and officials should follow to ensure sustainability of the idea, its effective implementation and maintenance of the system evolved. This was the key takeaway from the post lunch session of the event, which was dedicated to the role of community in water conservation. In this, models and community leaders from different parts of Uttar Pradesh shared their prototypes with the vision that it may show the way to others. To bring out the best from these case studies, a panel of experts comprising Prof Prabhat K. Singh, department of civil engineering, IIT-BHU, Farrukh Khan, technical specialist, WaterAid and Prof Venkatesh Dutta, faculty, School of Earth Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University moderated the session and gathered the takeaways. Real life stories from Gonda, Barabanki and Siddhartnagar were used to speak about the need, potential and role of the community in water conservation by Nagendra P Singh, WASH specialist, Unicef UP in the opening session. He spoke at length that the community needs to be convinced about something to embrace the cause and commit their contribution in it. Former district magistrate of Banda, Heera Lal shared how only community can translate vision into action. Citing his journey in this parched Bundlelkhand district, Heera Lal — presently serving as additional mission director National Health Mission UP — said that his biggest learning was that contrary to the belief that officers lead campaigns, it is community that is the true harbinger of change. “Banda’s story of change became a model because people took it forward… as a system or as the administrative leader of the district (read DM), we can just be facilitators,” he said. Recalling Mahatama Gandhi’s thought that empowering women accelerated social change, Sanjay Singh, national convenor of the Jan Jal Jodo Abhiyan, shared the story of Jal Saheli — women committed to water conservation in the parched Bundelkhand. Presently active in 93 villages, the Jal Sahelis work on all aspects of water conservation which has also made their own lives simpler. Stating that water conservation required indirect methods as well, Prof. VK Tripathi, department of Agricultural Engineering, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University spoke about what farmers can do to save water. Citing precision irrigation as the means, he said that switching from traditional irrigation methods to drip irrigation can help in irrigating larger area, increase crop yield, enhance nutrient efficiency to as high as 90%. The session concluded with the thought that water security was directly linked to food security and both the elements were crucial to human survival which makes community participation indispensable. The thoughts on this were presented by Mohd Afjal Ahmad, UN Awardee on Water Cooperation and assistant professor in department of physiology, institute of agricultural sciences, BHU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/way-forward-community-must-lead-administration-should-follow/articleshow/86853945.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kanpur||IIT-K, Univ of Queensland researchers find key molecules to help fight inflammatory diseases||Times News Network Kanpur: The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) and The University of Queensland (UQ) have published the results of a path-breaking international collaborative research on inflammatory diseases. The findings, published in ‘Molecular Cell’, a peer-reviewed scientific journal on molecular and cell biology, throw light on a protein receptor, C5aR2, that plays an important role in the moderation of many immune and inflammatory processes and explores its use as a potential therapeutic target for treating multiple chronic inflammatory diseases. The research witnessed international collaboration between IIT-K Professor Arun Shukla and Asuka Inoue of Tohoku University, Japan and Stéphane A Laporte of McGill University, Canada. IIT-K claimed it to be the first time key molecules within the immune system have been identified which may help fight the inflammation leading to chronic inflammatory diseases. The findings will help further research in novel drug molecules that can act on the receptors for C5a, a potent immune molecule that is linked to immune-linked inflammatory diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis and even Covid-19. Director, IIT-K prof Abhay Karandikar said, “We are optimistic that the findings of the research will lead to new light in the fight against chronic inflammatory diseases.” University of Queensland, professor Trent Woodruff said that the research investigated the part of the immune system responsible for the body’s natural response to pathogens and injury, known as the ‘complement system’. He said, “When activated inappropriately, the system drives inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, COVID-19, stroke, heart attacks, cancers and brain illnesses. It’s been really challenging for researchers to understand how this protein is activated due to its unusual structure.” “Instead of coupling with cell-signalling proteins, C5aR2 relies on signal regulating proteins known as β-arrestin proteins. Our study investigated interactions between the C5aR2 and β-arrestin proteins, while screening for molecules that activated a connection between the two. We found key and specific cell signals present when the C5aR2 was activated, which may boost the immune system’s response in inflammation,” added Prof Woodruff. Co-investigator Professor Arun Shukla said the findings provided a framework for further exploration of β-arrestin proteins for their therapeutic modulation in disease. “We are now working to progress these research findings into disease models and potentially enable scientists to design novel drug molecules targeting C5aR2 to treat inflammatory disorders”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-univ-of-queensland-researchers-find-key-molecules-to-help-fight-inflammatory-diseases/articleshow/86852381.cms||---

AP joint action committee (APJAC) affiliated to AP NGO association and APJAC-Amaravati on Thursday expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s stand towards employees. APNGO president Bandi Srinivas and APJAC-Amaravati chairman Bopparaju Venkateswarlu held a meeting with various associations of employees and pensioners and held a joint press meet. “We have waited for the last two years to give some time to the government to solve the issues of retired employees. “But we are now in financial trouble. Many employees who have retired recently have not received their benefits. The finance department turned a blind eye towards the payment of GPF and other benefits. Not even chief secretary is addressing our issues,” Venkateswarlu said. “YSRCP gave many assurances to employees before it came into power, but no single promise was fulfilled. We are waiting for our DAs, salaries are getting delayed, PRC recommendations were kept aside, we are unhappy with these developments,” Bandi Srinivas told the media. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had assured to abolish the CPS system, but the promise has been ignored by the government and no steps have been taken as yet to keep the promise made by the CM, he added. The employees’ associations also demanded the government to abolish the CFMS system and make payments manually. They requested the chief minister to look into the issue and solve the pending demands of employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/employees-unions-demand-release-of-da-other-benefits/articleshow/86852395.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Allahabad||Houses turning breeding grounds for mosquitoes, find survey||Prayagraj: Officials of the health department are in a catch 22 situation after finding that deserted coolers, flower posts and abandoned or unused articles dumped on roof of the houses have turned breeding grounds for mosquitoes in majority of the houses, particularly in the low-lying belt of Ganga, in Sangam city. After carrying out a detailed survey in over 60,000 houses, particularly located in hotspots area like Chota Baghara and Govindpur, the officials found that over 40 percent of the owners or tenants have not cleaned their coolers, flower pots, or have not disposed off unused articles kept on side of the roof of houses since a month. Moreover, due to accumulation of flood water in the open plots and basements in Chota Baghara locality (low-lying area of river Ganga), the area has become hazardous breeding ground for mosquitoes, giving way to rise in cases of mosquito-borne diseases. With tally of dengue patients crossing 347 mark in the city and its tentacles spreading in trans Ganga and Yamuna pockets, joint teams of health, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) are interacting with residents daily and unabatedly appealing them to take preventive measures to check the spread of vector -borne disease. Out of the total number of patients who contracted dengue in the city in the past one month, the houses of more than 50% of them served as the breeding ground for the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti – carrier of dengue virus –lays eggs in fresh water and even a small puddle can become its breeding ground. District Malaria Officer (DMO) AK Singh told TOI on Thursday, “Our teams found that larvae were thriving in a number of spots inside residential premises, including abandoned object kept on rooftops, flower pots, deserted coolers, and old tyres. Residents in Chota Baghara have not even wiped out flood water from the basements of their houses. Moreover, open plots in low lying areasof Ganga - where flood water accumulated during floods - have also turned breeding grounds for mosquitoes." Currently, over a dozen localities, including posh areas of Civil Lines are under the scanner of health officials and anti-larva spraying exercise has been intensified to keep the disease at bay. Health department claimed to have surveyed over 60,000 and three lakh houses in urban and rural areas of the district in past one month. Singh, meanwhile, claimed that things are under control and health teams are knocking every door in rural and urban area to create awareness. A team of district authorities is also conducting verification of at least 150 houses daily that were being surveyed by the basic health workers in city and rural pockets. Senior medical Officer Dr Anupam Dwivedi said, “Aedes mosquito’s egg hatch into larvae in less than a day and attains adulthood within a week. The breeding cycle is 10-12 days." “House owners or tenants should regularly clean water sites in their houses. If it is not possible to drain out water, a little kerosene can be poured to kill larvae,” he added. With more cases of dengue reported in both rural and urban areas, denizens need to be extra vigilant and check mosquito breeding grounds on an urgent basis. PMC authorities claimed that they have been carrying out extensive anti-mosquito activities like fogging and anti-larvae spraying, but it is also the responsibility of residents to maintain hygiene and they must check the accumulation of water in and around their houses and vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/houses-turning-breeding-grounds-for-mosquitoes-find-survey/articleshow/86852434.cms||---

DCP (Traffic) will ensure that the said lane is not encroached upon and is always free for movement for fire brigade and ambulance,” a bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla ordered. The bench also directed Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Delhi Police and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to ensure that the recommendations/suggestions given to the court by the fire service are “implemented at the earliest.” During the hearing, the bench was examining each of the key areas flagged by the fire service after a drill conducted recently at Nehru Place. On the need to make the area hawker-free, SDMC informed the court that despite a specific area being delineated for hawking, the hawkers are spread across the entire complex. SDMC also told the court that only 95 vendors have interim orders in their favour from the Supreme Court and the high court. A majority of hawkers don’t comply with the terms of tehbazari/conditions of vending, the civic body claimed. “This court directs SDMC, DDA and Delhi Police to ensure that no other individual or entity other than 95 vendors hawks in and around Nehru Place. Even the identities of the 95 vendors shall be verified and the respondents shall ensure that the vendors comply with the terms and conditions of tehbazari/vending,” the bench ordered. It also decided to list pending cases involving 33 vendors before it along with a few contempt petitions. The bench ordered advocates appearing for civic agencies, such as DDA, SDMC, Delhi Police, and chief engineer project, additional CP (traffic), additional CP, South-East and deputy commissioner, Central Zone “to visit Nehru Place within the next fortnight at a mutually convenient date and time and file a status report.” The court also asked Delhi Jal Board to file a status report within two weeks. TOI had reported on Thursday how a mock fire drill revealed that Nehru place is a veritable fire zone and emergency vehicles do not have access to the inner courts of the sprawling commercial complex. In its report sent to the high court and DDA, the fire service said hundreds of shopkeepers, vendors and big businesses were at deadly risk because even rescue vehicles were able to access only the outer portions of the market. The fire service recommended urgent measures like a ban on roadside parking and freeing the market of hawkers. It also suggested a ramp for emergency vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-create-separate-lane-for-emergency-vehicles/articleshow/86850487.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Nashik||Nashik: Dismissed cop threatens family with revolver, fires at police officer||Nashik: A former assistant police inspector, who was dismissed from service by the state government five years ago, threatened a farmer and his family with countrymade revolvers at their house and shot at a sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) at Digras village of Rahuri taluka in Ahmednagar district on Thursday. Fortunately, the bullet only grazed the SDPO’s trousers. The dismissed policeman, Sunil Lokhande, was overpowered and arrested. SDPO Sandip Mitke told TOI that Lokhande, who was dismissed from service for his involvement in two cases of extortion, went to the house carrying two illegal country revolvers around 8am and locked the door from inside. He had been demanding Rs 3 lakh from the farmer for some time now, Mitke said. “The farmer, his wife, their 19-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son were at home when Lokhande went there. Somehow, the family managed to alert the police. We went to the house and used a megaphone to communicate with Lokhande as he was not opening the door. We tried to convince him to allow us inside so that we could help resolve the issue. He allowed us in after a lot of coaxing on the condition that we come in without any arms. We agreed,” said Mitke. Mitke said that when the police team entered, they found Lokhande holding a firearm to the head of the farmer’s daughter. “He became agitated when he started talking to him and fired from his revolver. The girl started screaming. When I moved towards him, he fired at me and the bullet went between my legs, grazing my trousers. I pounced on him and grabbed his firearm. The other members of the team overpowered him,” he added. Deputy inspector general (DIG)-Nashik range B G Shekhar Patil and Ahmednagar superintendent of police Manoj Patil, who visited Rahuri, lauded Mitke for his courage in nabbing Lokhande. “Lokhande was dismissed from service five years ago, while he was posted in Satara, for his involvement in two cases of extortion in Pune city and Shirur in rural Pune. He presently lives at Wanowrie in Pune city,” Shekhar Patil said. The Ahmednagar SP said the court had acquitted Lokhande in the Shirur case but he was jailed in the Pune case after being convicted in 2012. He later challeged that verdict in the Bombay high court and is presently out on bail. “We have arrested Lokhande and are in the process of lodging two FIRs against him. One FIR will be from the family which will include sections 304 (attempt to murder), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. The police will file a separate FIR under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 307,” said Mitke, adding that Lokhande will be produced in court on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dismissed-cop-threatens-family-with-revolver-fires-at-police-officer/articleshow/86846199.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: AICC makes health minister Raghu Sharma Gujarat in-charge||JAJPUR: In a surprise move, health minister Raghu Sharma was appointed AICC in-charge of Gujarat, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli with immediate effect by the Congress central leadership late Thursday night. AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal issued a statement on behalf of Congress president Sonia Gandhi in this regard. Sharma had held a meeting with the top brass of the party in New Delhi on September 24. It is believed a plan to appoint him Gujarat in-charge was discussed then. Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot too had met the Congress central leadership in Delhi on the same day. Initially, there were talks among Congressmen about Pilot being considered by AICC as the Gujarat in-charge. Gujarat would be going to assembly elections by December next year. Before the 2017 Gujarat election, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who was not holding any constitutional or party position then, was sent as in-charge of the state which has been giving a tough time to the party since 1985. Gehlot had brought Congress closer to victory in 2017 but BJP has remained undefeated there since 1995. Sharma’s appointment as in-charge of a state heading for assembly elections puts a question mark on whether he would be able to continue as a minister in the Gehlot cabinet. In the corona times, handling the health portfolio in itself remains a full-time job and may make it difficult for Sharma to also head a poll-bound state. An expansion and reshuffle of the council of ministers has been long overdue in Rajasthan. With pressure building from the Pilot camp, Gehlot is expected to rejig the cabinet by accommodating new faces and dropping a few existing ones this month. Efforts made to contact Sharma for a reaction failed as his mobile phone remained unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/aicc-makes-health-min-raghu-sharma-gujarat-in-charge/articleshow/86852671.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: I’m hurt by I-T action on sisters, says Ajit Pawar||MUMBAI: NCP President Sharad Pawar and his nephew Ajit Pawar, who is deputy chief minister, reacted sharply to the income tax raids on the latter’s relatives who are associated with cooperative sugar factories in western Maharashtra. Ajit Pawar expressed shock saying he had never thought that central agencies would target his sisters. “I am hurt by the income tax department action. My sisters settled in Kolhapur and Pune long back, they have grandchildren, why raid their offices and houses? Just because they are my sisters? I never thought politics would reach such a low level,” he said. Pawar said this was the first time he had seen such action against the relatives of a senior cabinet member. “I am finance minister of the state, I am aware of tax liabilities on myself as well as firms controlled and owned by me, I am an honest taxpayer, I was never a defaulter. The income tax department has the right to raid and search any premises to identify tax defaulters, it must take stern action against erring persons, but I never thought that they would raid my aged sisters,” Pawar said. Ajit Pawar said he has been informed of raids on certain firms controlled by him, but saw nothing wrong in it if the purpose was to detect evasion of tax. “I have no objection. But I do not know why the houses of my sisters were searched and raided. It is high time we understand how the central agencies are being used by the government. It is for the people to ask, how long should we tolerate gross abuse of power,” he said. Sharad Pawar too expressed surprise over the action at the residence of Ajit Pawar’s sisters. “Prima facie, it appears that IT action follows my stringent criticism of the Lakhimpur incident. I had likened it to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. In fact, even the state cabinet had unanimously condemned the Lakhimpur incident. We feel the IT department is exceeding its brief,’’ Sharad Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-im-hurt-by-i-t-action-on-sisters-says-ajit-pawar/articleshow/86852461.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||‘Record plantation drive has improved green cover’||Varanasi: Highlighting how record plantation during his government has improved green cover in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said “plantation is being done for improving the environment as well as betterment of the life of rivers as jungles help in maintaining better flow of water in rivers.” Yogi said that all 30,000 revenue villages in the state will be covered with piped water supply by 2023. However, each household in 10 districts of Bundelkhand and Vindhya region will become equipped with tap water by December-end, he added. Addressing the valedictory session of a conclave under The Times of India’s ‘Make UP a water positive state’ initiative on Wednesday, the CM said, “Most government programmes have multiple purposes. We ensured the planting of 100 crore saplings in the recent plantation drive, and only trees and plants like peepal, banyan, pakad, neem, desi mango, which have medicinal quality and are beneficial for nature, earth and human beings, were preferred.” “Third party verification of the plantation drives in the past three-four years has shown that green cover of the state has improved,” said Yogi adding, “The improved forested area will improve the life of rivers as it is a fact rivers passing through jungles have a better flow of water.” The CM further stated that the water crisis in Bundelkhand is over, with hectic efforts of restoration. “We are also going to ink an agreement for linking Ken and Betwa rivers soon,” he added. Referring to the apathy of previous governments that lingered 12 ambitious irrigation projects like Bansagar for four-five decades, he said, “After coming to power in 2017, I ensured completion of Bansagar project within a year, which helped in improving irrigation facilities in 2.5 lakh hectare area.” “Other major irrigation projects will be completed soon to make an additional irrigation facility for 22 lakh hectare land by incorporating advanced technologies of irrigation like sprinklers to avoid wastage of water,” he stated. The CM praised the Kashi model of groundwater recharging, and said that officials in Varanasi decided to utilize defunct handpumps for rainwater harvesting by fixing filters. “This experiment brought down the cost of installation of the rainwater harvesting system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/record-plantation-drive-has-improved-green-cover/articleshow/86853966.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Rai also launched a dedicated web portal to monitor adherence to dust norms, which would allow any construction taking place in Delhi to make online payments and submit self-assessment data of whether or not government guidelines were being met. Track the pollution level in your cityStating that more construction sites would be inspected in the coming days as part of the anti-dust campaign that would continue till October 29, the minister said complaints regarding generation of dust near Pragati Maidan were received by his office. The site inspection revealed that tarpaulin nets had only been placed around the site for “show”. “We got to know about the negligence by L&T at the tunnel they are constructing at Pragati Maidan. I visited the site to take stock of the situation and found gross violation of the guidelines,” said the minister, adding that the agency had been given two days to respond and take corrective measures following which a fine or Rs 5 lakh per day would be levied. The minister said, “There was dust all around. The tarpaulin net was only put up for show and was torn either completely or in parts. The anti-smog gun didn’t have water in it. All of this shows how the agency doesn’t care about the norms. We are issuing them a show-cause notice with a Rs 5 lakh penalty today. If we don’t receive a satisfactory reply soon, then we’ll take strict action. If they don’t comply within two days, they will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5 lakh per day.” Last month, TOI had reported how travelling on Mathura Road along Pragati Maidan was turning into a nightmare for commuters, with a cloud of dust hanging in the air. After launching the “Dust Pollution Control Self-Assessment Portal”, Rai said training would be provided to both private and government agencies on how to use it. “Through this portal, all construction work going on in Delhi, be it a house or work of agencies and contractors, will be closely monitored. Training will start next week to teach people how to work with the website,” said Rai, adding that municipal corporations, DDA, PWD, CPWD, irrigation and flood control department, DMRC, DSIIDC, NHAI and others would be trained in the first phase. In the second phase, private companies would be given training. Eventually, people would carry out self-assessment with the help of the corporations. “There are two categories under which one can connect to the portal. There are 15 mandatory measures that need to be followed by everyone and 12 desirable measures that will make for a total score of 260 points. While the mandatory measures make up 200 points, another 60 points will be awarded for following the other 12. Based on the total, action will be initiated and payment will have to be made,” said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lt-fined-rs-5-lakh-as-govt-starts-anti-dust-campaign/articleshow/86850552.cms||---
---||Nashik||3 including husband booked for triple talaq, lawyers object||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad city police on Wednesday booked four people, including the husband of the complainant, on the charges of giving triple talaq to his wife. The legal experts here have said that it was contrary to a recent ruling of the Bombay high court. The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court recently quashed and set aside the prosecution of two in-laws of a woman from Beed under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 (for instant triple talaq) observing that the same was “unsustainable” and holding that only the husband was liable to be prosecuted and not his relatives. A man, his mother and sister were booked in the case. The complainant has stated that she was being forced by her in-laws to undergo permanent contraception surgery. After she did not agree, her husband allegedly pronounced oral talaq. HC lawyer Sudarshan Salunke told TOI, “Registration of offence under section 4 of the Act, 2019 against relatives of husband is bad in law, as only husband who pronounces talaq can be prosecuted.” Echoing him, another lawyer Nilesh Ghanekar said that the directives as well as ruling by HC and SC are very clear. However, police said that though the offence has been registered, at the time of filing of chargesheet, specific role of each suspect would be defined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/3-including-husband-booked-for-triple-talaq-lawyers-object/articleshow/86846219.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The family of the elderly man seen being thrown over the bonnet of the car on impact told TOI it was indeed him in the video, adding that they would return the compensation of Rs 45 lakh they have been given by the UP government if the accused are not arrested soon.

Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer,” Varun tweeted. He and his mother Maneka Gandhi were dropped from BJP’s executive council list announced on Thursday. The video has been shared by thousands since Wednesday night. The elderly man in a light green turban seen in the video, tossed up in the air and run over by the car, was identified as Nachattar Singh, one of the four farmers who died that day, by his family. He was 60. “It is him. It is beyond painful to watch my father being killed. I feel helpless and shattered,” his son Jagdeep, a doctor from Ramdanpurva in Lakhimpur Kheri, told TOI.  “My father never harmed anyone. He was a peace-loving man, loved by everyone here. He always wanted one of us to at least join the armed forces. That’s why my brother, Mandeep, is training with the SSB now. Our father was a peace-loving man.” Mandeep got home on Thursday from Uttarakhand. “I wish they (drivers of the Thar and Fortuner seen in the video) had stopped after hitting my father. He may have lived. But they sped up and crushed him. It was cruel. Calling it an accident is a lie,” he said. Questioning the delay in investigation, Jagdeep said they would hand the compensation back if arrests were not sped up. He added, “There are videos, there are eyewitnesses. We don’t want money, we want justice. If the accused are not arrested, we will give back the (Rs 45-lakh) compensation the government gave us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/protesters-cant-be-silenced-through-murder-tweets-bjp-mp-varun-gandhi/articleshow/86848235.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Pune||Worshippers return masked & cautious as Navaratra begins||Pune: The first day of Navaratra, which coincided with the reopening of places of worship after a long gap, saw devotees queuing up at Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Mandir . A calm and cautious atmosphere prevailed inside as people waited— five feet apart — for darshan, a contrast from the traffic chaos outside on Laxmi Road with passersby trying to catch a glimpse of the idol and click photos of the decoration. Ashok Godse, president, Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust, said the temple’s doors opened again on Thursday amid chanting and the sound of the ‘shehnai’. “Darshan was conducted in adherence to all safety precautions as per the state government. Only devotees who wore masks were allowed to inside after checking their temperature and sanitising their hands,” said Godse. Close by, at Shree Kasba Ganapati Mandal, visitors were few and far between. “Apart from Ganeshotsav, there is not much crowd at this temple, which is why I like to come here. But even then, visitors have been cautious. Before the pandemic, I used to sit in the temple for a while after darshan, now we are supposed to just pray and go,” said Nanda Taware, temple visitor. Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar in Camp was abuzz with devotees. “The turnout through the day was 25% more than regular days. Everyone followed safety protocols without us having to tell anyone to comply. We had an elaborate langar where we served kadhi-pakoda, chawal, and jalebi,” said Mohindev Singh Kandhari, PRO, at the gurdwara. Mosques welcomed devotees to offer their daily prayers on the premises. Hazrat Maulana Nizamuddin Fakhruddin, president of the Darul Uloom Nizamia Sufia, Kondhwa, said, “People enjoyed the experience of offering prayers with fellow members of the community at the masjid. We had around 100-150 people come throughout the day. The sense of peace that you feel when you pray at the mosque is different from doing namaz at home and we are glad to have that back.” At St Anne’s Catholic Church, Solapur Bazar, parish priest Father Malcom Sequeira said not too many people were expected since it was a weekday but many worshippers will come on Sunday. “Members of our church are divided into different groups — 30-40 families have a WhatsApp group with one ‘leader’, who will guide them through safety precautions and social distancing protocols on that day. We will also put a few chairs on the loft if the church is full, and when that is also occupied, we will close entry for that service,” said Sequeira Saptashrungi sees highest footfall in Nashik district The Saptashrungi temple on Thursday registered the highest footfall of devotees among all prominent temples in Nashik as the reopening of temples coincided with the first day of Navaratra. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal visited the Saptashrungi Devi Mandir in Vani, a gurdwara in Shingada Talao, and the Badi Dargah at Kazipura in Nashik city. Though the yatra — the annual fair — has been cancelled this year due to the Covid-related restrictions on gathering of crowds, the number of devotees registering themselves online and visiting the temples stood at about 6,500 till Thursday evening. 11,000 people visit Shirdi Saibaba temple Officials of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST) on Thursday said 11,000 devotees visited the temple on the first day of the reopening of Shirdi Sai temple. "The turnout of devotees for darshan was encouraging. We are optimistic that the footfall will further increase. The bulk of the devotees on Thursday were from within the state," the officials said. The SSST management has made the online booking of passes mandatory. No offline passes are being distributed to prevent overcrowding at the pass centres. A total of 15,000 devotees will be allowed per day and 1,150 per hour||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/worshippers-return-masked-cautious-as-navaratra-begins/articleshow/86850538.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

These two PSA plants have a capacity of producing 1,000 litres/min (lpm) and 500 lpm. Union minister of state for health & family welfare, Bharati Pawar, was present at the civil hospital during the online programme. Mayor Satish Kulkarni, MLAs, civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat and others were present at the time of inauguration. “The Union government is dedicated towards the well-being of all citizens. In order to be well prepared to treat the patients who may be suffering from covid infection, assured storage and supply of oxygen is required. Hence, the government has provided these PSA oxygen plants,” said Pawar. With the addition of latest 1,000 lpm oxygen producing PSA plant at civil hospital, it now has two such systems. The newly installed PSA plant will help supply oxygen to the isolation ward – where the patients with symptoms and awaiting Covid test results are kept. It is also where pregnant women suffering from Covid will be admitted. The existing PSA – which has been constructed from district planning committee-funds — has been attached to the intensive care unit. It will also be used for 200-bed Covid facility that will be added if and when required. Similarly, the 500 lpm PSA plant raised at Niphad SDH will help the 60-bed covid and non-covid facility in the hospital. The taluka has 200 covid bed facility at Pimpalgaon, where two PSA plants are being installed, Lasalgoan has 40-bed facility with one PSA plant and Chandori has one PSA plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pm-modi-inaugurates-two-psa-oxygen-plants-in-nashik-hosps/articleshow/86846255.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was speaking after inaugurating the newly constructed 450-bed teaching hospital of Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences. Kovind, who started his speech in Kannada, heaped praises on the erstwhile Mysuru royal family.“This region has been fortunate to have had a line of kings who were ahead of the times in thought and action. Maharaja Chamaraja Wadiyar was a reformer who established Kannada medium school for girls in Mysuru as early as 1881. He was also instrumental in Swami Vivekananda attending the Parliament of Religions at Chicago. This legacy of progressive contribution was taken forward by Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar who was the first ruler of a princely state to sign the Instrument of Accession after Independence. I like to describe him as a monarch-democrat. He blended the rich tradition of Mysuru with the best of Western civilization.....As medical students, and later in life as health-care-providers, you must work with the spirit of service and compassion, demonstrated by the noble kings of Mysuru,” he said.Terming the college a mini India, he stated that around 50% of the medical students and 60% of the nursing students are women which shows daughters of our country are taking great strides. “This reflects a progressive India marching ahead in the 21st century,” he said.Terming the education and health care as the twin foundations for the development of a nation, he requested the students to acquire deep knowledge of life science and also insight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/president-kovind-inaugurates-teaching-hospital-in-cnagar/articleshow/86848304.cms||---
---||Mysuru||CM skirts around jinx, visits outskirts||Mysuru: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai created a history of sorts on Thursday by visiting Chamarajanagar town, breaking the political jinx as he attended President Ram Nath Kovind’s event at the Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences located on the city’s outskirts. The chief minister, who arrived from Mysuru by road, reached the event venue via bypass. However, he didn’t visit the deputy commissioner’s office, which upset the activists who said he should have entered the town.It is feared in the political circles that a sitting CM will lose power within six months of visiting the town, which came to be associated after S R Bommai lost power. On Wednesday, Basavaraj Bommai made it clear that there is no link between his father’s visit and him losing power in 1980s. S R Bommai’s successors Veerendra Patil and S Bangarappa also lost power within six months of visiting the border town which pushed HD Deve Gowda, JH Patel, S M Krishnaand Dharam Singh to abstain from visiting the town. It was 16 years later when HD Kumaraswamy broke the jinx and he headed the coalition government in 2007. But his successors B S Yediyurappa and DV Sadananda Gowda shunned visiting the town. Though Jagadish Shettar and Siddaramaiah took on the jinx, Yediyurappa did not.Progressive farmer Honnur Prakash, who is the Chamarajanagar district president of the farmers’ association said Basavaraj Bommai still has some fear about entering the town. “He disappointed all of us,” he said.‘It’s my duty to visit C’nagar’Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai stated there is no need for any debate on his visit to Chamarajanagar. “It is my duty to visit here. Chamarajanagar is an integral part of the state. If I don’t come, it is equal to dereliction in duty. If we do any work with good thoughts, beliefs, everything becomes good. There is no good or bad time. Everything is in our minds. We must come out of this narrow mindedness. Medical education is based on scientific research. The youngsters must develop scientific temperament. I will go to Chamarajanagar DC’s office next time,” he said.Farmers detained The police detained tens of Raitha Sangha activists led by its state unit vice-president Mahesh Prabhu, who were planning to hold a protest seeking action against Uttar Pradesh government, and three farm acts. Police detained them even before the arrival of the chief minister.“Our activists were not planning to create any disturbance. We were trying to get the attention of the President of India. Our activists wanted to hold banners to ensure that the President is aware of what is happening in our country,” said Badagalapura Nagendra, Raitha Sangha state president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cm-skirts-around-jinx-visits-outskirts/articleshow/86848289.cms||---

The minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, has been summoned by the SIT. “Among the unnamed accused in the (farmers’) FIR, six have been identified so far. Three of them had died on the spot. Two others — Lav Kush from Banbirpur and Ashish Pandey from Taranagar — were arrested on Thursday,” a police statement said. ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI, “They will be produced in court.” Earlier in the day, IG (Lucknow) Laxmi Singh said, “They revealed the names of three persons involved in the incident. We cannot arrest them because they are dead. We have gathered important leads from the two persons we are questioning.” On Thursday morning, the Supreme Court had asked the UP government to file a report on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence by Friday. A single-member judicial inquiry panel of retired high court judge Pradeep Kumar Srivastava was announced on Thursday. It will submit a report in two months. The SIT initially announced, meanwhile, had six members — Kheri additional SP Arun Kumar Singh, who was at Banbirpur village that day, two deputy SPs and three inspector-rank officers. In the evening, a new setup was announced — the SIT will have eight members, led by DIG Upendra Agarwal, with PAC commandant Sunil Kumar Singh as a senior member and ASP Singh as a member, along with the others. “Ashish Mishra has been summoned for questioning,” IG Singh said. A notice, asking Ashish to be present at the Kheri crime branch office at 10am on Friday, was pasted outside his house. A media report quoting a relative of the minister had said Ashish had left Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. When asked, ADG Sabat said, “The investigation team is looking into it.” Significantly, police also said empty cartridges had been found during a sweep at the site of the killings in Banbirpur. “On Wednesday, the site of the incident was examined by the forensic team. Two empty .315 cartridges were found. On Thursday, metal detectors were used at the spot again,” a police statement said. While the families of farmer Gurwinder Singh and journalist Raman Kashyap, killed in Sunday’s violence, said the bodies had bullet holes, the autopsy report did not mention any gunshot wounds. Eyewitnesses TOI spoke to -- and reported by this newspaper -- had said “over 10 shots” were fired, that those in the convoy were the ones who fired and that the sound of bullets went off for hours when the two cars were burnt down, hinting that cartridges inside the vehicles may have combusted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/first-arrests-made-in-kheri-violence-sit-summons-union-mins-son/articleshow/86848294.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad has written a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, suggesting the option of alternative land available at the southern side of the airport. “The acquisition of earlier identified land, located on the north side, will affect around 15,000 locals, whose resistance against giving the land is not waning. On the other hand, the agricultural land available on the south side can be easily acquired as farmers concerned are willing to hand over their land. The alternative option of land will also save cost of acquisition,” Karad, a Rajya Sabha member hailing from Aurangabad, said. Last year, in August, Union minister for civil aviation Jyotiradiya Scindia had established communication with the Maharashtra government to make available the required land to accomplish the long-pending work. The land records department, in June this year, had undertaken a process to measure the land required for the proposed expansion. However, things did not progress further. The proposed expansion involves extending the existing runway to 12,000 feet, building a parallel taxiway, installing sonar panels and providing a hangar for the aircraft, among other works. While the demand for expansion of the Aurangabad airport is quite old, the hopes of stakeholders were rekindled, when the previous BJP-led government in Maharashtra had announced Rs 200 crore to create the desired infrastructure. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached for his comments on exploring the alternative option of land for the expansion work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/min-seeks-alternative-land-for-airport-devpt/articleshow/86846226.cms||Prasad Joshi

Krishna, who flagged off the 411th Mysuru Dasara celebrations at the hill shrine, said, “Sri Chamundeshwari is our refuge and shield in this fight against Covid-19, and she will come to our aid.”Amid the pall of gloom cast on the celebrations by the pandemic, Krishna’s prayers instilled hope among those gathered at the ceremony and the public in general. There is a sense among the people that the worst has passed.Krishna reminisced about his longstanding tryst with Mysuru, an association dating back to his days as a schoolboy. “I was 10 when I came to Mysuru, and I have always watched the Dasara celebrations since then. Today, I had the opportunity of flagging off the event, and I extend my gratitude, in particular, to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai,” he said.Emphasising the contribution of the Wadiyars in developing the Old Mysore region, Krishna added, “Those involved in the freedom struggle opposed the idea of monarchy, but the contributions of the Wadiyars cannot be overlooked or erased from the pages of history. Should we forget history, we will not have a bright future. The erstwhile Mysuru royal family preserved the culture and tradition of the land, and it was the Wadiyars who constructed the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) Dam.”The former CM pointed to the illustrious history of the Naada Habba celebrations, which dated back 800 years, its legacy stretching back to the Vijayanagara kings. Krishna heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he credited with taking India on the right track. “I have never seen anyone working as tirelessly for the nation,” said Krishna, who appealed to CM Basavaraj Bommai to turn Mysuru into a tourist hub.“The Naada Habba celebrations attracts visitors from across the world, and the government must tap into its potential by offering a package that includes visiting various historical sites including Aihole, Pattadakal, Belur, et al. We must emulate Singapore’s model in this regard. Singapore is deriving most of its revenue from tourism,” Krishna said.Defending the government’s decision to have Krishna flag off the Dasara celebrations, Bommai highlighted the former CM’s many contributions to the state including the launching of ‘Yashasvini’ scheme, besides transforming Bengaluru into a technology hub.Bommai assured Krishna of taking his suggestion to enhance Mysuru’s tourism potential, and develop a circuit for international visitors around the Heritage City. “We will have separate budgets for tourism and promotional activities to draw visitors in hordes,” he added.However, not all were pleased with Krishna being the cynosure of all eyes at the event, with most dignitaries in attendance heaping praise on the former CM. There were those who grumbled about the heritage of the Mysuru Dasara being relegated at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/krishna-prays-to-chamundeshwari-to-save-nation-from-pandemic/articleshow/86848318.cms||---

Local residents have claimed that the tripping of power supply has now forced them to get back to village wells, bore wells as well as neighbouring water bodies in order to meet their daily requirement for water. Authorities said that the water supply scheme, started over a decade ago, currently faces an outstanding bill amounting to over Rs 4 crore. Despite repeated reminders and requests to clear the power bills, the gram panchayat (GP) has failed to do so, following which the power supply of the water scheme has been cut. Local MLA Mohanrao Hambarde told TOI, “Of the total outstanding amount payable, almost half of it is the interest component on the outstanding amount.” Hambarde said that he has already raised the issue with district collector Vipin Itankar, who has given an assurance that the matter will be considered, and help will be provided to resolve the issue. The MLA also added that the panchayat would pay the outstanding amount in installments, provided the interest rate is waived off by MSEDCL. When contacted, sarpanch of Dhanegaon village Gangadhar Shinde said that the water supply scheme was started by Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran in 2002-03 for Wajegaon, Tuppa and Balirampur villages, having a total population of about 60, 000 to 70,000 people. It was in 2007-08, the water supply was started. As considerable land was acquired from Dhanegaon village for construction of the scheme related infrastructure, villagers from Dhanegaon started demanding their inclusion in the water supply project. Shinde said that the village gram panchayat was asked to pay 10 per cent of the scheme’s total cost and accordingly the villagers crowd funded about Rs 20 lakh and handed it over to the panchayat, which deposited the amount with the authorities and got Dhanegaon village included in the scheme. The villagers blamed the contractor for running the scheme but failing to pay the power bills. In the year 2012, the Zilla Parishad took over the scheme. The village gram panchayat claimed that they were not aware of the previous dues and they continued to pay the current bills, even as the previous bill and interest continued to pile up. Tukaram Patil, a local villager, said that the four villages are being punished for no fault and demanded that the power supply to the scheme must be restored at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/villages-fail-to-pay-power-bill-supply-cut/articleshow/86846281.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Chandigarh||‘Victory of BJP candidates in elections by huge margins is testimony to people’s approval of govt policies and progs’||Completing four years in office in December this year, Jai Ram Thakur has the unique distinction of facing maximum elections and byelections during the tenure of a chief minister of Himachal Pradesh. After coming to power, he faced the parliamentary elections in 2019 and ensured the victory of BJP candidates on all four seats by a record margin. The same year, he faced two byelections to Dharamshala and Pachhad assembly seats and ensured the victory of party candidates. Then came the elections of panchayats, municipal corporations, municipal councils, nagar panchayats, block development councils, and zila parishads at the beginning of this year. Now, at the yearend, there are byelections to three assembly seats of Jubbal-Kotkhai, Arki, and Fatehpur beside Mandi parliamentary seat. Interestingly, once the byelections are over, Thakur will have to prepare for the assembly elections next year. In an interview with TOI’s Anand Bodh, Thakur spoke extensively on issues confronting the state and his government. Excerpts: Are the byelections to three assembly and one parliamentary seat going to be a referendum on your government before the assembly polls next year? This is for the first time when byelections involve 20 assembly constituencies of the state (three assembly seats of Arki, Fatehpur, Jubbal Kotkhai, and 17 assembly seats under Mandi parliamentary constituency), but it would not be right to describe it as a referendum on the government. We are contesting to win in all four byelections. After assuming the office, we have maintained the BJP’s winning streak and this trend would continue in the byelections, followed by assembly elections next year. Our basic objective is to consolidate our position in the state. Mandi parliamentary seat was of BJP and it would remain so in the future too. Congress had won Arki and Fatehpur seats in 2017 but we will try to reclaim these two assembly seats also. Development in the state ensured in the last around four years by my government would be highlighted before the people and they would be told what we have done for them after coming to power. During the Covid pandemic, my government ensured that developmental activities continued, and I am confident that in 2022 BJP will repeat the government in the state. Congress is accusing your government of failing to control the prices of essential commodities and for increasing unemployment. Did inflation and unemployment end under the Congress rule? It is Congress that is responsible for unemployment as it ruled the state and country for the longest period post-independence. It is not correct on the part of Congress to blame BJP for this. It has no other issue because it is struggling for survival and facing a Punjab-like situation wherever it is in power in the country. Even in Himachal, the party is without a leader who could lead it and under such a situation, everyone has become a leader in the state. The situation for Congress in Himachal has worsened following the demise of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh. Himachal is celebrating 50 years of its statehood. Can you give us highlights of this journey till now and what are your government’s plans? The state has made unparalleled progress in all spheres of development during the last 50 years. It has not only emerged as a pioneer among the hill states but also become a role model for other developed states of the country. Progress made by it in the field of education, health, horticulture, social welfare and infrastructure has been remarkable. At the time of statehood, there were only 4,693 educational institutions and about 587 health institutions to cater to the needs of the people. Today, there are over 15,553 educational institutions and about 4,320 health institutions. Similarly, the road network has increased from 10,617 km in 1971 to 37,808 km today. All this was achieved despite difficult topography and limited resources. The present government, during the last about four years, has ensured that the pace of development has remained uninterrupted and got further impetus. Its main focus during all these years has been on making the state self-reliant, create quality infrastructure, provide ample opportunities for employment and self-employment to the youth, increase the income of the farming community, ensure empowerment of women and weaker sections of the society, provide incentives to entrepreneurs to set up their units and ensure that the state actually achieved the target of ‘Shikhar ki Aur’. Himachal has topped in administering the first dose of the Covid vaccine in the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated this achievement. What is being done to achieve the target of 100% success of second dose coverage? The state achieved this despite geographical constraints and limited resources. The credit goes to the hard work and dedication of our doctors and para-medical staff, who ensured that no one was deprived of vaccination. The state has set the target of achieving cent-percent vaccination by the end of November this year, which would be a big achievement. Health infrastructure is inadequate in the state and most patients are being referred to Chandigarh, Punjab, or Delhi for treatment. What are your plans to strengthen health infrastructure in the state? My government is committed to strengthening infrastructure by providing specialty health care facilities to people nearer to their homes. Facilities in all six government medical colleges are being strengthened. In fact, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda, and Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College, Mandi, have emerged as the best medical colleges in the region. All these medical colleges and zonal hospitals, as well as district hospitals, are being equipped with the latest technologies to cater to the needs of patients. Besides, specialist doctors are being deployed in major health institutions. For the last one-and-a-half years, the Covid-19 pandemic almost stalled the normal functioning of governments, including yours. How much has the pandemic affected your government’s performance? No doubt, the pandemic has adversely impacted the pace of development the world over, but the state government ensured that it remained uninterrupted. During the peak time of the pandemic, I virtually inaugurated and dedicated developmental projects worth over Rs 4,200 crore in 42 Vidhan Sabha areas of the state. This was mainly aimed at ensuring that developmental projects do not get affected due to lockdown. What are the plans to strengthen health infrastructure at district and sub-division levels as we regularly hear about patients being physically carried from remote areas to Shimla or Tanda hospitals? As I have already said, the government is committed to strengthening the health infrastructure at the lowest level. The main focus of my government is to strengthen health institutions at district and sub-divisional levels as this would lessen the burden on major medical colleges and hospitals in the state. All these institutions have been equipped with specialist doctors, trained staff and machinery, besides providing them ambulances to transport critically ill patients to district and state hospitals. New medical colleges opened at Nerchowk in Mandi district, Hamirpur, Nahan in Sirmaur district and in Chamba but some posts are still vacant. Why has filling of posts become challenging? A few posts could not be filled due to the non-availability of specialist doctors in these medical colleges. The government is striving to fill up such posts at the earliest in a phased manner so that people benefit. Is there any plan to increase epidemiology seats in medical colleges, especially after the pandemic? The government is contemplating increasing posts of epidemiologists in medical colleges to meet any future challenges of Covid-like situations, as the pandemic caught the whole world unaware and unprepared. Your government organised Global Investors Meet in Dharamshala which was also attended by the Prime Minister besides many business groups. What is the positive outcome of this meet? Organising the Global Investors Meet was a major initiative of the state government, which turned out to be a big success. The event was blessed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who invited the investors to invest in the state. Himachal was able to attract MoUs worth over Rs 96,500 crores and within two months, ground-breaking ceremonies of projects worth over Rs 13,500 crores were done and graced by Union home minister Amit Shah. Projects worth Rs 10,000 crores are ready for ground-breaking ceremonies and the event would be held any time in November. The tourism sector is the main source of employment and livelihood of the people in the state, but the unregulated flow of tourists is throwing up several challenges and raising environmental concerns. Nature has blessed Himachal with immense tourism potential. The tourism sector is a major contributor to the state’s GDP and gives direct and indirect employment to lakhs of youth of the state. My government is committed to promote tourism in a big way. We have prepared a comprehensive tourism development plan for sustainable tourism by laying thrust on developing lesser-known tourist destinations. We started the Nai Raahein Nai Manzilein scheme to develop Chanshal as winter sports destination, Janjehalli as eco-tourism destination, Bir Billing as an adventure tourism destination, and Pong Dam as a water sports destination. Shiv Dham is being developed in Mandi at an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore. Does the government plan to limit the number of tourists to a destination or divert flow to newer locations? So far, the flow of tourists has been witnessed towards Manali, Shimla, Dharamshala and Dalhousie, irrespective of the fact that the state has many other attractive destinations. Himachal is a world-acclaimed tourist destination and attracts tourists from all over. Tourism is also a major revenue contributor to the state exchequer. The government’s focus is to create tourist infrastructure in lesser-known and virgin tourist destinations to lessen the burden on already crowded destinations like Shimla, Dharamshala, Manali and Kullu. This would not only equitably promote tourism in the state but also provide gainful employment and self-employment to the local youth. What steps has the government taken, or will take, to increase air and rail connectivity in the state. Since Independence, rail connectivity has reached only up to a small stretch of Una district and the Heritage train has been unable to sustain any increase in speed. The government strived hard to construct a greenfield airport in Mandi, besides expanding the existing airports in Shimla, Dharamshala, and Bhuntar. The 15th Finance Commission has recommended Rs 1,000 crore for this greenfield airport. This would not only provide better air connectivity to the state but also facilitate high-end tourists to visit the state. Similarly, the government has empathetically taken up the matter regarding rail connectivity to the state with the Union government. We are expecting that in the coming time, Himachal will definitely get its share in rail connectivity. In the absence of good air and rail connectivity, roads are the only mode of transportation in the state. But now traveling by roads has become risky due to frequent landslides and sliding boulders. Can you detail your government’s strategy to tackle this? Also, what is being done to make the road journey safer? How will the government deal with the challenge of frequent landslides along Shimla-Kinnaur, Kalka-Shimla and Chandigarh-Manali highways? In absence of better air and rail connectivity, roads are the only and major mode of transportation in the state. This has resulted in a heavy flow of traffic, particularly during the peak tourist season. All major roads such as Kalka-Shimla, Kiratpur-Mandi-Aut-Manali, Shimla-Dharamshala, etc are being upgraded as four-laned to facilitate commuters. Since road widening requires the cutting of hills, which at times results in landslide and soil erosion, we are going for scientific cutting and land excavation to ensure minimum damage to the ecology. Retaining walls and breast walls are being built to stabilise the hillside and minimise incidences of landslides. Another issue is the lack of motorable roads in rural areas. The government had ambitious plans to create a record number of highways and increase lanes in the existing ones. However, the work pace is slow. That is not true. The state today has a strong road network of over 37,000 km and out of 3,615 panchayats, only a few remain to be connected. Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee started PMGSY during his tenure as prime minister of the country, which proved to be a boon to the state in creating a strong road network in rural areas. The present Union government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also given due importance to road connectivity in hill states like Himachal. A record number of national highways and four-lane projects have been sanctioned for the state. During his recent visit to the state, Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari assured the government that the work on all these projects would be expedited. National Green Tribunal is not happy with the poor waste management, illegal mining, and pollution of rivers. Several directions have been issued by it in the past. What is being done to ensure proper collection of waste and its systematic and scientific disposal, especially in rural areas, besides stopping river pollution and illegal mining? The government is committed to the conservation of the state’s pristine environment. We have prepared an action plan for effective waste management. Plastic waste shredders, plastic waste baling machines and plastic waste compactors are being provided to urban local bodies to collect and manage plastic waste on a sustainable basis. In addition to this, ULBs will also be provided technical support to make plastic bricks and tiles for permanent plastic waste management. The state government is also launching special campaigns from time to time to motivate the people to take an active part in sanitation campaigns and ensure proper management of domestic waste. Door-to-door waste collection of garbage is being ensured in all urban areas and effective steps are being taken to check illegal mining and river pollution. Following the landslide at Batseri in Kinnaur in which nine persons died and another landslide at Nigulsari in Kinnaur which killed 28, hydel projects are being blamed and opposition to power projects has started. What is the strategy to overcome this local opposition, especially in Kinnaur and Lahaul Spiti districts? Both these incidents were unfortunate, and steps must be taken to ensure they don’t reoccur. The government will judicially look into the matter and ensure that no developmental projects are executed at the cost of the safety of the people. Since the topography of tribal districts of Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti is different from other areas of the state, the government would be extra cautious while allocating hydropower projects in these districts. Is Himachal taking any steps to harness natural energy like wind or solar? Nature has blessed the state with immense power potential and as per estimate, Himachal has identified hydropower potential of over 25,000 MW, out of which approximately 11,000 MW stands harnessed. The government has decided to also explore possibilities of harnessing natural energy potential such as wind and solar. This potential could be effectively harnessed particularly in the tribal districts of the state. Providing safe drinking water to residents is set to become a major challenge as climate change is affecting natural sources and creating drought-like situations in summers. What is being done to meet the future challenges of water shortage? Climate change has no doubt posed a big challenge to humanity, therefore providing potable water would become a major challenge in times to come. The state government is aware of the situation and is laying special stress on water conservation and maintenance of traditional water sources. Jal Jiwan Mission is being effectively launched in the state, under which about six lakh households have been provided water connections. The government has also banned unscientific mining in riverbeds and check dams are being constructed for water conservation. The Congress claims that Himachal has failed to witness the level of development it should have in the last four years despite having BJP governments at the Centre and the state. Has the state failed to make gains despite having a “double engine” government? This may be their perception, but there has been witnessed unprecedented development during the last about four years despite the Covid pandemic almost ruining two years of the present government’s tenure. The state has benefited immensely from the ‘double engine’ government, as schemes like Ujjawala Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna, etc. have benefitted lakhs of families. The assembly elections are due next year, and your government has just about a year left. What is your agenda for the remaining period of your term? The main agenda for the next year would be to further accelerate the pace of development, create resources of employment and self-employment for the youth, make the state self-reliant and give a human face to development. The government would lay special focus on the completion of ongoing projects so that people could benefit from these projects. The government would also ensure optimum exploitation of tourism, power, industrial and agro potential of the state. Efforts would be made to double the income of the farmers by 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/victory-of-bjp-candidates-in-elections-by-huge-margins-is-testimony-to-peoples-approval-of-govt-policies-and-progs/articleshow/86852638.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

To start with, city police commissioner G Karthikeyan implemented the system at some key junctions like head post office, Major Saravanan roundabout, K T junction and old Palpannai roundabout. The instrumental music of Tamil numbers being played through the small loudspeakers mounted on these traffic signals has come as pleasant surprise for motorists in the past couple of days. “As I stopped at the head post office roundabout, I heard music coming from somewhere nearby. It was quite soothing for someone like me who finds riding through this maze a nightmare,” said a motorist, K Balasubramian.Though the wait at traffic signals in Trichy may not be longer than that in cities like Chennai, the increase in vehicle population in recent years makes it a bit lengthy at some signals. According to traffic police, the duration of waiting at the signal is based on the vehicle volume on the stretch. Head post office and Mannarpuram signals have the maximum duration of up to 100 seconds while the rest have smaller wait time. The city traffic police handle around 20 signals and whenever the fixed duration and vehicle movement don’t match, they switch to manual mode of signal. Besides film music, awareness messages on traffic regulations and Covid-19 SOPs are also played. Commissioner of police G Karthikeyan told TOI that the system will be implemented at all traffic signals in the city for which work was going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/music-to-soothe-your-wait-at-signals/articleshow/86852585.cms||Gokul Rajendran

In a meeting last week, which was chaired by transport minister and DTC chairman Kailash Gahlot, a decision was taken to get 1,015 electric and 230 CNG-run buses in the financial year 2021-22. DTC has a fleet of 3,762 buses, out of which 2,644 were procured between 2007 and 2010 and are nearing “end of life”. As per procurement contracts under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the lifespan of these buses is 12 years or 7.5 lakh km, whichever is later. To cater to Delhi’s public transport needs, the corporation had to request State Transport Authority to allow its buses till 15 years from the date of registration. The current proposal will be sent to the Delhi government for sanction and approval of funds required for procuring the buses, besides the same for setting up the infrastructure, such as charging stations, needed to operate electric buses. The e-buses will be inducted under the operating expenditure model, under which the operator is paid operating cost per kilometre, of FAME India Phase II Scheme — Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II — issued by Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises. The second phase of the central scheme aims to support 7,090 e-buses with an incentive of up to Rs 50 lakh each. DTC is already carrying out the process of engaging 300 electric buses, which are expected to roll out from next month and the rest are likely to hit Delhi’s streets by next February. In a meeting on October 1, the DTC board also decided to appoint Delhi Integrated Multi Modal System (DIMTS) for piloting the tendering process for induction of buses. The corporation has been unable to procure buses for nearly a decade primarily due to the issue of annual maintenance contracts. Delhi should have at least 11,000 buses even before Covid-19-induced social distancing norm slashed the capacity of its public transport system. The combined fleet of DTC and Cluster Scheme is more than 6,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-board-approves-induction-of-1245-buses-operator-to-be-paid-cost-per-km/articleshow/86850623.cms||---

While PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the one at Gangauri Hospital digitally from Rishikesh, 41 others were virtually inaugurated by health minister Raghu Sharma. The plant installed at Gangauri Hospital has a capacity of producing 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. The oxygen plants were installed with the support of PM Cares. Modi digitally inaugurated 35 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants in different locations across 35 states and UTs from AIIMS-Rishikesh. “Today, inaugurated 41 oxygen generation plants through videoconferencing from the district collectorate Rajsamand,” Sharma tweeted. With the inauguration of 41 oxygen plants, the state is now inching closer to achieving the target of producing 1,000 metric tonnes of oxygen daily. The state had faced severe shortage of oxygen during second wave of Covid in April and May. Following the harrowing experience, the health department had set a targeted to develop facilities of oxygen generation across the state including oxygen concentrators. Health secretary Vaibhav Galriya said after the second wave, the state government was ensuring availability of oxygen through oxygen generation plants and oxygen concentrators. Out of 546 oxygen plants proposed, 250 plants are not ready to function. Apart from the plants, as many as 40,000 oxygen concentrators have also been made available. Since the health department is anticipating the third wave, it has worked in the direction to make the state self-resilient in oxygen production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/42-oxygen-plants-inaugurated-in-a-day-in-the-state/articleshow/86852554.cms||---

The mobile application was dedicated to the state police by chief minister M K Stalin, two days ago. The application can also be used on the computer with internet connectivity. The purpose of the software is to identify a photograph of an individual with a data uploaded on the crime and criminal tracking network system (CCTNS) of Tamil Nadu police. The state crime records bureau (SCRB) of Tamil Nadu police has already uploaded 5.30 lakh photographs and profiles of criminals and anti-social elements in the state. The system will help the police to check the criminal background of the person in question by using his or her photograph. The search using the photograph in the FRS will reveal the cases against the person in the police stations across the state. Besides helping the police to track the criminals, the software can be used to verify the background of the suspects and to check if any warrant is pending against them. It will also help the police trace the missing people and ascertain the identity of the unidentified bodies. In case of a suspect involved in criminal cases in other police stations, the police can pass on the information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-police-to-use-frs-to-nab-suspects/articleshow/86852572.cms||---

The theme this year was ‘Cotton for Good’Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute director Ambethgar said that cotton is a global commodity grown in over 75 countries across five continents and traded worldwide. “Cotton is creating jobs and maintaining economic stability not only nationally, but also in rainfed based districts like Perambalur and Ariyalur. Recent technologies developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University like new variety of CO 17 cotton has several features,” he added.“Perambalur and Ariyalur districts are the cotton hub of Tamil Nadu. Mechanization of cotton farming and yield improvement is important to increase the cotton area and to reduce drudgery faced by cotton farmers in these districts,” joint director of agriculture (Perambalur) S Karunanidhi said. Head of the station Somasundaram said productivity can be improved through high-density planting, mechanical sowing using pneumatic seed drills, growth retardant spraying etc. “Cotton for good means good done by cotton in terms of fibre and food for farmers youth, labourers and industry. Cotton gives employment to lakhs of people. Moreover, cotton also gives food in the form of oil extracted from cottonseed, which is largely used in western countries as topping on salads,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-encouraged-to-cash-in-on-high-demand-for-cotton-by-products/articleshow/86852629.cms||---

---||Trichy||Trichy health officials want ward-level Covid vaccination survey done||TRICHY: Even as 69% of the eligible population in the city have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the civic body is now facing challenges in sustaining patronage for the vaccination drive. Trichy corporation had planned to vaccinate 40,000 people in the mass vaccination camps on October 3, but managed to achieve only half the target. At this juncture, health officials pitched for a ward-to-ward survey to scale vaccination coverage so that less-covered localities can be focussed. “Through the study, we can rationalise the conduct of vaccination camps by covering localities where the reach is poor. Perhaps, we can analyse the reasons for the low coverage,” a medical officer under the condition of anonymity said. The civic body is conducting vaccination camps in 10-12 locations daily. Only in Srirangam zone ward 16 have officials conducted a pilot survey to ascertain vaccination coverage. The result is yet to be disclosed. “We may require the support of field workers and volunteers for a survey covering all the 65 wards. A decision will be taken,” a senior official with Trichy corporation said. In rural parts of the district where around 10 panchayats have completely covered the eligible population excluding those with contraindications. As 2.23 lakh eligible population is yet to be covered, the health officials for the past two weeks have been facing the heat to sustain the patronage for vaccination drives including mass vaccination campaigns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-health-officials-want-ward-level-vax-survey-done/articleshow/86852602.cms||Deepak Karthik

The drive, being carried out in association with Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), aims to clean the entire stretch of the Yamuna falling under South East district in the next 20 days, officials said. It will end on October 27. Known as the “Waterman of India”, environmentalist and Magsaysay awardee Rajendra Singh flagged off the campaign, saying each small effort made a difference. More such efforts are needed to clean the river, said Singh, shouting the slogan, “Yamuna nadi ke jung mein hum sab sang hai”. The drive, which is part of Clean India Programme by the Union sport and youth affairs ministry, saw volunteers from RWAs and NYKS. The south corporation used nets to clean up large parts of the river, removing water hyacinth and other waste floating on top. Earthmovers were also called in, while groups removed solid waste strewn across the floodplain. The drive will continue along the floodplain in different parts of the district, officials said. Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar and district magistrate Vishwendra asked volunteers to make all-out efforts to make the Yamuna cleaner. Apurva Shinde, programme director of NYKS, East district magistrate Sonika Singh and her Shahdara counterpart, Sanjeev Kumar, were also present. A 2% stretch of the Yamuna in Delhi accounts for nearly 76% of the total pollution of the river, studies have shown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-week-clean-yamuna-campaign-kicked-off/articleshow/86850658.cms||---

A similar amount was released in mid-July as the Centre helps states and union territories meet the shortfall in tax revenues. This is in addition to the normal GST compensation being released every two months out of the actual GST cess collection. The Centre advised states to used the funds to meet their public expenditure particularly improvement of health infrastructure and completion of infrastructure projects through proper planning. Goa’s GST collections have improved over the last two months. Aided by resumption in tourism and industrial activity, the tax collections in September hit pre-Covid levels. Goa has agreed to the Centre’s funding arrangements to meet the GST compensation shortfall. The Centre has borrowed the funds through five-year and two-year bonds. No additional market borrowing by the Central Government is envisaged on account of this release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-gets-rs-213cr-gst-compensation/articleshow/86852711.cms||---

The activicts, who recently audited the worksite, claimed that the terminus once reopened after reconstruction, will cause more traffic woes than resolving the issue. They are now planning to approach the ministry of housing and urban affairs to revise the design.With 90% of the city buses accessing the bus stand, the activists questioned the plan to go with a ‘bay’ design, most suited for halting mofussil buses for five or more minutes. “City and suburban buses will not halt beyond five minutes. Even in the Koyambedu city bus terminus, there is no bay arrangement but lanes to halt the buses on the go. No city bus will prefer to park in the bays,” said N Ramakrishnan, founder secretary, MGR Nalpani Mandram. Because of the design flaw, city buses may park outside the terminus.They also complained about the narrow entry and exit points of the bus stand. Claiming that only one bus can access the points at a time, they said that such restriction may create traffic bottlenecks. “It is better if the bus stand reopens after undergoing minor modification. Trichy Corporation has to hear the public opinion,” P Aiyarappan, a road safety activist said. “The lane type of design was not accepted by the committee that okays our proposals. Only bay type design was approved and sanctioned after scrutiny,” a source with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/design-of-chathiram-bus-stand-flawed-say-activists/articleshow/86852616.cms||---

The card scheme includes parents having one or two daughters only. Even couples having one son and a daughter have been excluded. Card bears the name of the girl(s)’ mother and father and their address and other details. Pink card holders will not have to stand in a queue, or if necessary make a separate queue, in all government offices — be it panchayat, revenue, or municipal corporation. The mamlatdar office is distributing these cards after verification of all details. Talking to TOI, district collector of Junagadh, Rachit Raj said, “We want parents of girl child to feel proud of their daughters and get priority treatment in all government offices.

In a statement, Palaniswami alleged that prices of all commodities for agricultural inputs like fertilizers have gone up in the last five months of DMK rule. It has been reported in the last two days that fertilizers are not available in the state. Cooperative credit societies don’t have sufficient stock, leaving farmers in the lurch. Taking advantage of this, private traders and agencies have jacked up prices, he said. The government should address the grievances of the farming community on a war footing and stock the required volume of fertilizers, he added.PMK leader S Ramadoss said samba cultivation in Cauvery-irrigated districts has been affected due to shortage and increase in prices of fertilizers. Both urea and diammonium phosphate should be sold only through co-operative societies until the shortage is over. Action should be taken against those who sell fertilizers at an exorbitant price, Ramadoss stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/state-must-ensure-supply-of-fertilizers/articleshow/86852630.cms||---

The action was taken on the basis of inspection conducted on October 1. A report submitted by DPCC to National Green Tribunal (NGT) stated that it had issued directions to the SDMs concerned to ensure compliance with dust pollution control measures and see to it that no trading activity took place till the measures were in place. A plea was filed in NGT demanding remedial action against pollution arising out of the illegal business of building materials and use of heavy machinery. The tribunal constituted a joint committee comprising CPCB, DPCC and the district magistrate to look into the matter and take action. The joint committee found dust-related norms being violated and building materials being stored and traded. DPCC then asked the agencies concerned to take action. “As no concrete report was received, DPCC carried out the inspection of both the sites on October 1,” said the DPCC report. The major violations included lack of a wind breaking wall of sufficient height, no water sprinkling system to control dust pollution, the entire fine aggregate was not fully covered with green net or tarpaulin, the internal pathway for movement of vehicles was not concretised and workers were not provided face masks.

He said that at present TNCSC is procuring kuruvai paddy with a moisture of up to 17% as stipulated by the Centre. However, the produce brought by farmers to procurement centres had 20% moisture due to the rain. This has hampered procurement and harvest, OPS stated. Farmers cannot wait till crops ripen till the state government gets permission for enhancing the moisture content.

Considering the number of devotees who visit the Badrinath temple in Uttarakhand, at least this one Durga Puja pandal here has chosen to depict the Badrinath Dham temple. A team of 15 artisans and technicians are working round the clock the complete the Puja pandal at Kashiraj Nagar in the city on or before October 10. The Puja at Kashiraj Nagar Puja pandal will begin on October 11 and the visarjan will take place on October 15. Nayan Jaiswal, organiser of the Puja committee told TOI, “a major chunk of devotees visit Badrinath Dham every year from the city but due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the past two years, the devotees were not able to visit Badrinath Dham.” He further added, “Realising that devotees have to wish to visit Badrinath Dham to offer prayers to deities, the committee members decided that this year, they would depict their Puja pandal as Badrinath Dham temple”. Nayan further added, “When the devotees will visit the Puja pandal at Kashiraj Nagar, they would feel that they are standing on the campus of Badrinath Dham”. While the state government has asked for strict compliance for the prevention of the Covid-19 pandemic because of the upcoming festive season, Puja pandal samiti members reiterated that Covid safety protocols would be followed strictly. “Ahead of Shardiya Navratri, Vijayadashami, and Dussehra festival, the city-based Durga Puja pandal start working on different themes to erect pandals,” said Nayan. “This time, the idea for a pandal based on the Badrinath Dham came to our minds and we started working on it about a month back,” he added. He, however, said that it takes more than a month to erect a pandal and complete all decorations and both artisans and technicians work round the clock to get the work finished on time. “All in all, a pandal is a good example of teamwork and adequate funds were spent on it to make it grand pandal,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/07-oct-kashiraj-nagar-durga-puja-pandal-to-be-based-on-badrinath-temple/articleshow/86852633.cms||---
---||Allahabad||HC summons director of EOW in Shine City case||Prayagraj: In a recent progress in Shine City siphoning of multi-crore funds fraud case, the Allahabad high court has directed the director, Economic Offences Wing (EOW) to remain present before the court on October 22, which is the next date of hearing. However, the court exempted the personal presence of director general of police (DGP), UP, saying that since the matter has been sent to the director, EOW, therefore, the presence of DGP, UP is exempted. Earlier, on January 19, 2021, this court had passed a detailed order showing the default of UP Police and Economic Offences Wing in regard to the FIRs registered in the year 2019 onwards involving 1,647 investors. The total amount involved in those FIRs is amounting to Rs. 237 crores and for which 284 FIRs have been registered. During the court proceedings, when it was informed to the court that two main accused are out of the country and passport of one accused has been cancelled by the ministry of external affairs, the court said, “We fail to understand that why the request for cancellation of passport was not made immediately when 284 FIRs were registered against the accused and why the ministry of external affairs has cancelled only one passport out of two while requests was sent by the police simultaneously.” “In any case, we find that despite cancellation of passports, the information to the embassy of foreign country, where the accused are residing, has not been given so as to deport them. It is also that one accused, who is represented through the counsel in this proceeding and is available in India, has not yet been arrested.” the court added. The court intended to make serious observation about the working of the UP Police and Economic Offences Wing, however, on the request of additional advocate general Manish Goyal, who is representing the state government, the court adjourned the matter for two weeks to see further efforts of the police / Economic Offences Wing to arrest the two main accused apart from others against whom warrants of arrest have been issued. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Shriram Ram, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Piyush Agrawal directed that the respondents UP government and others would be expected to send a copy of this order to the ministry of external affairs to know about the proceedings and the order passed therein. “It is to take immediate action for cancellation of passport of other accused and information be sent to the concerned embassy," the court added. It is alleged in the PIL that accused persons of Shine City Group have cheated and defrauded more than 10 lakh investors of Uttar Pradesh of amount exceeding Rs 60,000 crore (approx. 8 Billion USD) and approximately more than 2,500 FIRs have been lodged against them and their companies in the conglomerate. One of the accused is allegedly absconding from India since July 2019, and no action has been taken by the government machinery since then to bring him back. The court passed these directives on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-summons-director-of-eow-in-shine-city-case/articleshow/86852667.cms||---

---||Kochi||Forest team monitoring Padayappa, the wild elephant||Munnar: The forest department has sent a rapid response team to Mattupetty to track the movement and health of the popular wild elephant fondly called “Padayappa” by local residents. For the past once week the jumbo has been camping on the premises of the Kannan Devan Plantation Company’s R &T Manager’s Bungalow. Local residents have raised concerns that the elephant could be suffering from some health problems as it has been found standing at the same spots for hours. M N Jayachandran, district secretary of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said that it is the normal behaviour of wild elephants to regularly move from one place to another. “Padayappa, it seems, has stopped moving maybe because it is facing some health issues. The forest department must immediately send a fully-fledged medical team to the spot and provide treatment to the elephant,” said Jayachandran. District forest officer Raju Francis told TOI that a rapid response team has been deputed to monitor the wild elephant. “The RRT team is closely monitoring the movements of the tusker. If needed we will provide treatment to the elephant,” said Francis. Padayappa, named after Rajinikanth’s hit film, has many admirers in an area known for man-animal conflicts primarily because of his calm nature. He makes “friendly” appearances on the road sides helping itself to foods stored in shops without making any damages to them. The elephant, believed to be around 60 years old, can be easily identified with his limp due to an injury on its hind leg and unusually long tusks. The tusker had gone missing from Munnar for several months in 2016 causing concerns among local residents thathe had migrated to deep forests. But in 207, the elephant returned to Rajamala in Munnar on the Thiruvonam Day. Since then it has been in and around Munnar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-team-monitoring-padayappa-the-wild-elephant/articleshow/86850725.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh plans register for drug traffickers from November 1||SHIMLA: At a time when Himachal Pradesh has shown trend of increasing drug abuse along with its neighbouring states, the police is planning to introduce a new register No. 29 for drug traffic operators (DTO) in all police stations from November 1. This register will contain details and particulars of persons involved in criminal cases regarding drugs and psychotropics. Since the state has problems related to illicit cultivation and trafficking of poppy and hashish along with other drugs like heroin (chitta) and synthetic drugs, a need was felt to monitor DTOs more closely and comprehensively. Himachal DGP Sanjay Kundu said this new register would allow police officers to monitor drug trafficking and trade more effectively and also help in bringing down the incidence of drug-related cases. He said this register was in continuation with those registers started to monitor sex offenders, unidentified dead bodies, suicides and missing women and children that had yielded useful information and data. “This new register 29 will also be included in the curriculum for new police recruits,” he added. According to the national survey conducted by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (AIIMS), New Delhi, prevalence of current use of charas/ganja is 1.2% in India and in Himachal Pradesh it is 3.2%. Similarly, the use of opioids is 2.80% in Punjab, 2.50% in Haryana, 2% in Delhi and 1.70% in Himachal Pradesh against the national average of 0.70%. Survey clearly indicates that North Indian tates have higher usage of drugs than national average. Kundu said Himachal Pradesh had three aspects of drug problem, including illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy and the production of respective narcotics drugs; illicit trafficking of drugs so produced that is supplies to interstate and international destinations; and drug consumption that is the market within and outside the state. He added that consumption trend is on the rise with newer drugs like “chitta” and other synthetic drugs. Th DGP said presently there was no mechanism to maintain exact data of offenders of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at police station, district and state levels. Though details of offenders are entered in the village crime register (register No. 9), there is no exclusive data available pertaining to offenders of the NDPS Act at police station level. He said that with the introduction of new register No. 29, proper and up-to-date data of offenders who have committed crimes under the NDPS Act would be maintained at police station level irrespective of their native state or country. “All offenders entered in the register will be put under surveillance periodically and entries will be made by officers not below the rank of head constable once in three months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-plans-register-for-drug-traffickers-from-nov-1/articleshow/86852710.cms||---

Solanki had sought bail on the grounds that the inquest of Kaniyo’s body revealed just one injury mark which disproves the police version that several persons had attacked Kaniyo. Solanki also stated that no murder weapon used for killing the gangster was found from him and he was falsely implicated in the case. Solanki’s bail application was opposed by the additional public prosecutor K P Chavan, who argued that Solanki was equally involved, along with other attackers, and he has criminal antecedents. The court also noted that during the hearing of a previous bail application, witnesses had deposed that Solanki along with the kingpin Sunil alias Sahil Parmar had attacked Kaniyo and another prisoner named Mohsin Khan Pathan. The court of principal district judge M R Mengdey upheld Chavan’s arguments and also considered the depositions of witnesses to deny bail to Solanki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/accused-in-ajju-kaniyos-murder-case-denied-bail/articleshow/86847681.cms||---

The count of fresh cases has come down so has the testing numbers in the state. The weekly moving average test per million population slipped below 1,000. As per the data of the state health department, the average seven-day testing numbers were recorded at 989 on October 5 and 999 on October 6, much below the 1,454 tests conducted on September 1. About 41% of the 22 districts had a lower testing average than the state’s weekly moving average test per million population on October 6. Against the state’s seven-day average of 999 tests per million population, only 292 tests per million population were conducted in Fazilka, 546 in Mansa, 598 in Sangrur, 621 in Moga, 698 in Bathinda, 865 in Patiala, 890 in Barnala and 924 in Amritsar. Punjab uses both conventional RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests for detecting the virus. As the second wave of infection is not yet over, the central government has been asking the state government to ensure adherence of Covid appropriate behaviour during the three-month festive season that kicked started with Navratri on October 7. The other major festivals falling in the next three months are Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali, Gurpurab and Christmas. In a communication dated September 28, the Punjab government was asked to issue directions to the district authorities to take necessary measures with a continued focus on test-track-treat-vaccination. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (SIPHER) said that special efforts need to be put in for ensuring high testing numbers, especially during the festive season, when there is a high gathering of people. "There is no room for laxity as we can’t say with certainty that the pandemic is over," he added. Targeted testingTo ramp up testing for timely detection and isolation of infected individuals during the festive season, the Punjab government has decided to focus on targeted Covid testing. The civil surgeons have been issued instructions to focus on areas where the risk of transmission is high. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, "The team of health departments will reach markets, malls and various other locations." Mobile testing vans will be pressed into service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-high-risk-festive-season-covid-testing-in-punjab-plunges/articleshow/86852677.cms||Vinod Kumar

With several Covid-19 restrictions still in place and organising committees requiring administrative permissions to hold Ramlila and Dussehra celebrations, many of the organisations are refraining from holding the event. “We have been organising the Ramlila at Hanuman Chowk for around 150 years now but last year, no celebrations were held given the Covid-19 situation. This year, too, we have decided not to organise the Ramlila to prevent any likely spread of the virus,” said Mohan Jaiswal, media spokesperson, Shri Ramleela Kala Samiti.In addition, one of the largest Dussehra celebrations that takes place at the city’s Parade Ground has also been shifted to a school at Race Course. “Earlier, the celebration would last two days but this time the event will be symbolic, which means people will get to see the event on Dussehra only. The administrative permission for the same is still pending. If it comes through, we will take all necessary precautions to ensure that there are no violations of any Covid guidelines,” said Santosh Nagpal, chief of the Dussehra Committee.

The process of closing the illegal cuts started in October last year. As per official figures, total 91 cattle fatalities were recorded from October 2019 to October 2020 on the Gandhidham-Samakhiali highway. Thanks to the closure of the illegal cuts, the fatality figures this year came down to 20 in the corresponding period. Busy traffic is a regular feature on the 56 km six-lane Gandhidham-Samakhiali highway as it connects Deendayal port in Kandla to Mundra port. Most of the 70,000 vehicles that ply on the highway are heavy trucks. “The villagers make illegal cuts on the highway which results in the animal fatalities due to the movement of heavy vehicles. We have closed down these cuts and if anybody reopens it, we will file an FIR against them,” superintendent of police Kutch (east) Mayur Patil said. The closing of the illegal cuts was done under police protection and L&T Company Limited, which also manages this road, carried out the work. The villagers made the illegal cuts on the highway to create shortcuts. Also, owners of the road-side ‘dhabas’ and petrol pumps too made the illegal cuts. Domesticated cattle and other animals stray on the highway because of these cuts, and many were mowed down by the heavy vehicles. Prakash Nayak, project head of this highway, said that hardly any human fatalities were reported due to the vehicle hitting the animals. “When a truck hits cattle, the driver is hardly hurt while the animals succumb to the injury most of the time. We wanted to reduce these cattle fatalities which used to go unreported,” Nayak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/illegal-highway-cuts-closed-cattle-fatalities-in-kutch-fall/articleshow/86848539.cms||---

He appealed to both the Centre and UT administration to beef up security to instil confidence in the minorities to prevent another bout of migration from the Valley. Expressing shock at the gunning down of two teachers in Srinagar, the SAD president said it was shocking that the two teachers – Satinder Kaur and Deepak Chand — were separated from members of the majority community after terrorists barged into their school and subsequently shot dead. He said an attempt was being made to create a sense of fear among the minority communities besides encouraging communal strife in the valley. He expressed his deep condolences to the family of Satinder Kaur, who was the principal of the Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, Idgah and her colleague Deepak Chand. Badal said it was shocking that seven civilians had been killed in the last five days in Kashmir. He urged the centre and UT administration to plug loopholes and strengthen security arrangements in the valley to put an end to the killing spree. “It seems members of the minority community, as well as outsiders, were being targeted as part of a new terrorist action plan. The UT administration needs to re-evaluate its security strategy immediately to meet this new challenge”. Badal also condemned the new onslaught on the Kashmiri Pandit community in Kashmir. He said the attack on leading businessman Makhan Lal Bindroo, while he was dispensing medicine at his pharmacy, was a cowardly act that had no place in a civilised society.

The remaining (14,534) Covid patients are undergoing care at hospitals and have moderate to severe illness,” said state surveillance officer Pradip Awate. Among the 14,534 hospitalized Covid patients, as many as 5,454 have developed severe illness and 9,080 patients have moderate illness. “Of the 5,454 patients with severe Covid, as many as 3,249 are on oxygen support and 2,205 are critically ill. They are being aggressively treated in various hospitals’ ICUs,” Awate said. Most of the Covid patients developing a serious illness in Pune and Mumbai are young patients aged below 50 years. Most of them have not taken the Covid shot, indicating that fully vaccinated people are less susceptible to coronavirus-induced serious illness. “The ICU admission trend coincided with the lowest vaccination numbers in the below-45 age bracket and underlined the importance to hasten Covid immunization in this young, productive and highly mobile category,” said Pune-based Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe. Infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid said, “The vaccine is really protective in terms of avoiding hospitalization or death, and a majority of people we are seeing that are sick and ending up hospitalized and on ventilators, are unvaccinated ones.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/57-of-active-cases-in-maha-showing-mild-illness-report/articleshow/86850717.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He appealed to both the Centre and UT administration to beef up security to instil confidence in the minorities to prevent another bout of migration from the Valley. Expressing shock at the gunning down of two teachers in Srinagar, the SAD president said it was shocking that the two teachers – Satinder Kaur and Deepak Chand — were separated from members of the majority community after terrorists barged into their school and subsequently shot dead. He said an attempt was being made to create a sense of fear among the minority communities besides encouraging communal strife in the valley. He expressed his deep condolences to the family of Satinder Kaur, who was the principal of the Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, Idgah and her colleague Deepak Chand. Badal said it was shocking that seven civilians had been killed in the last five days in Kashmir. He urged the centre and UT administration to plug loopholes and strengthen security arrangements in the valley to put an end to the killing spree. “It seems members of the minority community, as well as outsiders, were being targeted as part of a new terrorist action plan. The UT administration needs to re-evaluate its security strategy immediately to meet this new challenge”. Badal also condemned the new onslaught on the Kashmiri Pandit community in Kashmir. He said the attack on leading businessman Makhan Lal Bindroo, while he was dispensing medicine at his pharmacy, was a cowardly act that had no place in a civilised society. Badal said a SAD delegation would visit Srinagar shortly to meet members of the minority community, who had been singled out for elimination as well as meet the union territory administration to request for increasing security cover for members of the minority community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/sukhbir-condemns-systematic-targeting-of-members-of-minority-community-in-jk/articleshow/86860278.cms||---

The woman in her complaint alleged that Dr Ranawat frequently called her to his office for work. However, for the past few weeks, he was allegedly insisting her to come to his house for tea. She repeatedly declined his offer. On October 1, Dr Ranawat called her to his office around 4pm on the pretext of discussing some work. She alleged that he grabbed her hand and tried to push her. Police said she quickly informed her husband who arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes. The doctor ran away from his office when the complainant’s husband arrived to corner him. The woman wrote in her complaint that she was traumatized by Dr Ranawat’s behaviour. She sent a complaint to her department through an e-mail. Sources said senior officials were informed about the incident and an FIR was filed against the accused on October 3. Dr Ranawat was booked under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC. The health department also removed Dr Ranawat and set up an inquiry against him. A member of the panel constituted by the medical education department to investigate the matter said, “We will start conducting our inquiry and take the statements of Dr Ranawat and the complainant. We will present our report in 7 days.” Dr Ranawat is also holding the post of the registrar at Rajasthan Medical Council (RMC). A senior police official told TOI that they were currently collecting evidence against the accused. “We have to record statements of the woman. Ranawat will also be quizzed and may be arrested soon if allegations against him are found to be true,” the official claimed, adding police will also examine if the doctor, used his position as a senior official of the hospital to browbeat or intimidate the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/axed-jaipuria-hospital-superintendent-to-be-quizzed-for-harassing-female-staffer/articleshow/86852742.cms||---

The court noted in its order that one of the prosecution witnesses had stated about two other accused people but no investigation regarding them has been conducted in the case. “The investigating officer (IO) was confronted with this position. He has no answer to the same,” additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said in the order. An explanation was sought from DCP (northeast), following which a letter was submitted by the police on the following day seeking more time to file the report. The SHO of Gokalpuri police station also submitted that there was nothing in the police file that could even remotely establish that investigation with respect to the alleged two accused people was conducted in the matter. The court noted that the IO was not in a position to answer to why one complaint was the basis for registration of two FIRs. It said that whether the complaint could form the basis of two different FIRs was a question which was required to be answered by the prosecution. The case pertains to alleged vandalism of properties during the communal violence in February last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-face-flak-over-riot-probe-again/articleshow/86850716.cms||Usha Das

---||Delhi||CWC slammed for not giving kids’ custody to grandparents||New Delhi: A court has pulled up a child welfare committee (CWC) for entrusting the custody of two minors, whose mother allegedly died under mysterious circumstances, to a children’s home instead of their grandparents. The decision was “erroneous” and “cannot be sustained”, the court said. The children, aged 3.5 years and 5 months, were also found unconscious with burnt marks, police had said. Their father is in judicial custody. The children were produced before CWC, which sent them to a children’s home on July 2, 2021. The paternal and maternal grandparents then moved court separetely for their custody. The court has now granted the custody to the maternal grandparents and visitation rights to the paternal grandparents. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said an ounce of personal love and care for the wholesome growth of the minors was worth more than tonnes of professional services rendered at any public institution. “The kids on account of their tender age require special care, attention and affection… I fail to understand as to why the children’s home was chosen by the child welfare committee over the grandparents,” the judge said. The court further observed that even the best of care and attention provided in a formal, institutionalised and alien environment of a shelter couldn’t be an appropriate substitute for personal love and care of the grandparents. “Personal care and affection is...also essential for helping the kids overcome the grief of losing their mother and company of their father. The younger infant all the more needs to be in personal care of the grandparents as he is not even in a position to express his agony and grief,” the judge added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cwc-slammed-for-not-giving-kids-custody-to-grandparents/articleshow/86850771.cms||Usha Das
---||Pune||Pune: Flower business blooms, traders look forward to next week||PUNE: The flower business has begun to boom at the Gultekdi wholesale market, with vendors reporting a 15-20% increase in trade and in flow over the past couple of days as devotees geared up to visit religious places, allowed to open from Thursday. The surge in demand has also caused an increase in flower prices in the retail market. Retailers also attributed the price rise to recent rain, which damaged ready to harvest flowers. Mohini Karla, who purchased flowers ahead of Navaratra, said the price rise was unexpected. “I expected a drop in prices as flowers are available in abundance, but retailers told me that more than 50% of the flowers were damaged by the recent rain. Marigold was being sold for at least Rs120 per kg — a Rs20 increase,” Karla said. “The market is in revival mode now. There has been an increase in the inflow of flower consignments in the past few days. Prices of all types of flowers are stable. We are positive that the market will see more business; next week is crucial. From Sunday, we are expecting a rise in business leading up to the last day of Navaratra,” Arun Veer, head of the flower sellers’ body at Gultekdi, said. In the wholesale market, marigold was sold at Rs35-Rs. 40 per kg, while wet flowers were available for Rs20-Rs25 per kg. “The inflow of marigold and chrysanthemum (shevanti) has increased, but a large portion of the stock is damaged. People do not like buying wet flowers. Footfalls at the flower market have certainly gone up after the government’s move to open religious places for devotees,” Santosh Patil, a retailer of flowers, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flower-biz-blooms-traders-look-forward-to-next-week/articleshow/86850751.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||EDMC to engage RWAs in upkeep of green areas||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) is trying to revive its public private partnership (PPP) scheme to hand over at least 15% of the 950-acre green areas under its jurisdiction to residents welfare organisations (RWAs) or non-government organisations (NGOs). To make sure that quarterly payments to the RWAs are made on time, mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal has given an advance approval to the scheme and asked the finance department to keep the payment on the “priority” list, said officials. Some changes have also been made to make the scheme successful, they added. “We have approximately 950 acres of parks and 350 acres of it will be given to RWAs for maintenance. EDMC will make quarterly payments,” said an official. The scheme was launched in 2011 by the late external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj. “But after the trifurcation of Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the scheme became dysfunctional in the EDMC areas due to shortage of funds. Eventually parks started losing their sheen,” said horticulture director Raghwendra Singh. “We appealed to commissioner Vikas Anand to revive the scheme and he agreed. Later, the mayor also gave the anticipatory approval. Now we will start getting letters issued through councillors,” he added. Only one RWA in each ward will be chosen following the local councillor’s suggestion, Singh said. “Earlier, only parks of one acre and above could be offered under the scheme, but now we will give all parks and remove gardeners. However, supervision will be carried out frequently by section officers.” The RWAs will be paid Rs 2.14 per square metre per month to appoint gardeners and maintain the parks, its irrigation system, greenery and beautification steps. The plants and other facilities will be provided by EDMC. “The maintenance rates will be revised from time to time as per Delhi Schedule of Rates specified by the Central Public Works Department guidelines. These rates are based on the prevailing market rates of materials in Delhi,” said the mayor. If an RWA is not willing to do the maintenance work, an NGO having three years’ experience in the related field in the same zone can apply for the same, Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-to-engage-rwas-in-upkeep-of-green-areas/articleshow/86850758.cms||Vibha Sharma

Around 29 lakh beneficiaries have received the first jab in Pune rural, while the target is around 36 lakh. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The special drive will prove helpful to give a temporary boost to the drive concerning first dose beneficiaries. The earlier instruction from the state to us was to focus on the second dose beneficiaries. But now that the state and the district are close to achieving the completion of the first dose, this will make sure the remaining beneficiaries get their shots at the earliest.” The district is aiming at administering at least the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to all the eligible adult population by October end following the immunization of almost 87% beneficiaries till now. The district health office data stated that in the Pune civic limits, over 30 lakh beneficiaries had been given at least the first shot of Covishield or Covaxin, followed by 28 lakh in rural areas and 13 lakh in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits. Deshmukh said almost all the departments had been involved in the ambitious weeklong special drive to make it a massive success. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune Zilla Parishad, told TOI, “We shall adhere to the instruction passed on to us by the state government regarding the programme and will make sure that the drive results in maximum vaccinations.” On Thursday, around 22,473 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district in over 400 vaccination sites. According to Deshmukh, the shortage of syringes experienced earlier has now been resolved. The district has received around 2.5 lakh syringes, ranging from 0.5mm to 3mm, for the Covid-19 vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/7-day-special-vax-drive-from-today-to-clear-backlog-in-rural-pockets/articleshow/86850756.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The chief secretary was also told to find out if the petitioner’s claim that 240 Merino sheep bought for Rs 14 crore from Australia despite being unproductive held any ground. Maulekhi had alleged that Uttarakhand Sheep and Wool Development Board procured fodder for goats and sheep from Punjab at hefty prices, against the ones sanctioned by government, ignoring the fact that fodder was available at lower rates in Uttarakhand. The other issue that was brought up was that of 240 Merino breeder sheep from Australia and the amount (Rs 14 crore) spent on their purchase. The petitioner said that the Merino sheep were past their productive age and did not carry any health card. The PIL further alleged that Uttarakhand Livestock Development Board officials spent huge sums on purchasing official vehicles for themselves. The bench of Justices Manoj Kumar Tiwar and Alok Kumar Verma was informed by the petitioners’ counsel, Pragati Sanwal, that an inquiry has already been ordered by government into the purchase of fodder but the officials are yet to complete the investigation. Sanwal added that despite several representations by Maulekhi highlighting these issues, government is yet to take any decision. The bench said since an inquiry is already under way, the court will not interfere in the matter. But it asked Maulekhi to make a composite recommendation before the chief secretary within two weeks. “It goes without saying that before taking any decision, the chief secretary shall hear all persons, who are going to be affected by his decision,” the court said in its order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chief-secy-told-to-act-on-pil-over-corruption-in-fodder-procurement-sheep-purchase/articleshow/86848592.cms||Prashant Jha

An FIR was registered against the bus conductor at Harmara police station on Wednesday. The officials alleged in their FIR that the conductor took money from 144 passengers but issued them tickets reserved for freedom fighters. The embezzlement racket was unearthed when the department’s inspection team, also known as the flying squad, matched passengers’ tickets with the conductor’s record sheet and found multiple discrepancies. As per the FIR, four passengers were found to be travelling without the ticket while the rest 144 paid normal passenger fare which the conductor had pocketed and instead handed them tickets meant for free travel of freedom fighters. “The incident took place last month. An FIR was filed by the department on Wednesday. We are examining the note sheet prepared by the department about the contradictions discovered by the flying squad,” an official said. Jaipur police said that the bus driver is named in the FIR as one Lokesh Chopra. “He will be summoned for the enquiry. Besides embezzlement of fares, the department has also alleged that some of the tickets rolls to the tune of Rs 18,000 were missing,” a police official said, adding that the bus depot manager has also handed over ticket records to the police for the investigation. “It looks like an elaborate scam to cheat the transport department because, besides fraudulent tickets issued to 144 passengers under freedom fighter beneficiaries, some of the passengers did not have any ticket at all,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/conductor-pockets-fares-issue-freedom-fighter-tickets-to-144/articleshow/86852834.cms||---

Sunil Kulkarni, one such yatri niwas owner from the Khari corner area, said, “In the past one-and-a-half years, I have incurred losses of around Rs 30 lakh. The business was completely shut. I managed the bank EMIs and other expenses somehow by taking a personal loan. Now, with the temple reopening, we have already got advance bookings for our yatri niwas. A heavy turnout is expected even after the Navaratra festival.” Satish Vhatkar, a Kolhapuri chappal shop owner at Chappal Lane, said, “When the Mahalaxmi temple was closed, there was no tourist footfall in the city. On most days, not even a single pair of chappals was being sold from our shop. However, today (Thursday) we have had more than 10 customers till noon. Hopefully, the Covid situation will improve and we will be able to recover our losses.” Meanwhile, the florists in the temple area, are unhappy as the devotees will not be allowed to take Oti, saree or flowers with them. Anil Patil, a florist at Ghati darwaja, said, “It’s during Navaratra that we get most out of our business. But the devotees are not allowed to take flowers, oti, prasad or saree inside this year. Our shops are deserted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/businesses-cheer-temple-reopening/articleshow/86846537.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Maharashtra police to recruit trained drivers after more than a decade||PUNE: The state police have decided to recruit in the driver cadre more than a decade after such recruitment was stopped in 2009. As of now, constables with driving licences are put on the task of driving police vehicles for varied purposes, ranging from patrolling to transportation of heavy / light motor vehicles etc. However, these constables lack the skills required in specific situations like driving along the highways, chasing vehicles in cities, speed-regulated patrolling, and proper maintenance of vehicles. This leads to frequent breakdown of police vehicles. Prior to the 2009 restriction, candidates recruited in the police driver cadre were put through a six-month training at the state police’s motor transport (MT) department at Aundh in Pune. This included three-month training in driving skills and another three-months in maintenance of vehicles. Candidates formally inducted into the police services on completion of this course, were referred to as trained drivers. Additional director general of police (training and special unit) Sanjay Kumar told TOI, “The decision to revive the recruitment of trained drivers was taken in view of problems posed by unskilled drivers, lack of vehicle maintenance, and also a general reluctance among candidates joining the force as constables to take up the driving task.” Kumar said, “As per the last assessment made in 2019 (prior to the outbreak of the pandemic), the state police required over 1,000 trained drivers for its units across Maharashtra. We have asked all our units to provide a fresh report on their requirement of trained drivers. As per the requirement orders, the units concerned will recruit police drivers after taking driving test and letting them undergo the six-month training module at the Aundh MT department.” A senior police officer told TOI, “Police vehicle drivers are normally required to endure longer working hours compared to regular police constables and this also causes resentment among constables who are put on the job of driving vehicles. A properly trained driver can help resolve all these issues.” The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police are recruiting for other posts as well. On Tuesday, more than 12,000 out of the total 38,441 enrolled candidates appeared for Pune police’s recruitment exam for 214 constable posts. Meanwhile, the Pimpri Chinchwad police have received 1.9 lakh applications for the posts of 720 constables, the written examination for which would be held at different examination centres on October 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-police-to-recruit-trained-drivers-after-more-than-a-decade/articleshow/86850826.cms||---

The AAP functionary said, during AAP MLA’s interaction with the public, the common problem that arose was lack of sanitation. “If the garbage finds its way to dumpyards, it can be seen overflowing with huge piles of waste, which animals land up eating,” he said.  “The absence of workers from their duty checkpoints is because most of them are working for BJP members — serving them tea and snacks, or washing their cars. The high court wants this to be investigated on an urgent-basis too,” said the AAP member. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “In an attempt to politically malign the municipal corporations, the AAP government does not release adequate funds due to which the corporations are unable to hire increased number of sanitation workers needed to ensure 100% cleanliness”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-targets-bjp-run-corpns-for-garbage-pile-up-in-city/articleshow/86850807.cms||---

---||India||SC: What is basis of fixing income limit of Rs 8 lakh for EWS category?||NEW DELHI: Questioning the Centre on the basis for fixing an annual income limit of Rs 8 lakh for the economically weaker sections (EWS) category, which is the same for determining the creamy layer for OBCs, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked if it had conducted a study or exercise before taking the decision. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna, which is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Centre’s decision to implement OBC and EWS reservation in the All India Quota for medical admission, raised the question on how the same income criteria could be applied across the country. How can a person’s earning in a small town or village be equated with those earning the same income in a metro city, it asked. The petition said per capita income of states are different and applying the same criteria may not be reasonable. It said even House Rent Allowance given to a government employee is not same and depends on place of posting and suggested that income criteria for EWS reservation should be linked to cost of living of a place instead of making it uniform across the country. It said the income limit fixed for the OBC category for determining creamy lawyer could not be mechanically implemented in the EWS category as well. It said that there was no concept of social backwardness for the EWS category . The doctors who filed the petition have approached the SC through advocate Vivek Singh and sought an interim stay on the notification issued by the Centre on July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-what-is-basis-of-fixing-income-limit-of-rs-8-lakh-for-ews-category/articleshow/86855377.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Kochi||Kerala: No seats for many A+ students, govt clueless||KOCHI: The second allotment to higher secondary courses began on Thursday but there is no respite to worries about Plus-One admission as many students who scored A+ in all subjects are yet to get seats. Those who secured seats are also disappointed that they have not got the stream or school of their choice. Parents and teachers criticized the government's inability to resolve the seat shortage, with many of them posting critical comments below education minister V Sivankutty’s Facebook post on admission. Some of them ridiculed the liberal evaluation system and sought a thorough revaluation to reduce the number of top performers. The government should increase the seats or add new batches, they said. The minister says all students will get admission but students like me who scored full A+ are worried whether we will get admission to the course we need. I have applied for science stream in seven schools and commerce stream in one school but my name is not there in the second list too,” says Hiba Yasmin, a student from Kollam. Hiba says many students who scored less marks have secured admission on the weightage of nativity, panchayat, NCC and the like. “If we don’t get admission as per our choice, what is the use of the full A+ we secured?,” she asks. Many criticized the minister’s statement that those not getting higher secondary seats can go for VHSE, ITI or polytechnic courses.  “Earlier, he said all issues will be resolved in the second allotment, but now he suggests taking admission elsewhere. Students who studied hard to get admission in science or other streams with specific higher education plans are facing injustice due to the seat shortage. The government has the responsibility to give a sensible reply to them,” Elizabeth Susan, an FB user, commented. Many teachers, meanwhile, said the admission web portal was very slow and this leads to a delay in accessing details and uploading statistics of the second allotment. Many admission documents have to be downloaded from the portal. “Schools were directed to update admission details regularly but it is very difficult now. The server capacity needs to be augmented to ensure smooth access and use,” said Anil M George, state general secretary of Higher Secondary School Teachers' Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/students-raise-concern-over-getting-admission/articleshow/86855571.cms||---

The gang hijacked a truck carrying a cigarette consignment to Ahmednagar and later stole the boxes. Anil Wagh (32), the truck driver, approached the Shikrapur police on October 2 and filed an FIR. Wagh told police that he had collected the consignment of cigarettes from a godown at Shikrapur and was on way to Ahmednagar district for delivery. “Around 3am, when he reached near Vadagaothan, five men, travelling in a pickup truck, forced him to stop.

He said that the suspects then dropped Wagh along the Pune-Ahmednagar highway and drove away. Wagh found the empty truck abandoned some distance away. Shelke said that while investigating the case, constable Mangesh Thigale received a tip-off that Santosh Pawar and Swapnil Kandrup from Shirur had executed the robbery with the help of their three accomplices. “We laid a trap and took the duo into custody along with the pickup truck,” Shelke said.

---||Aurangabad||Marathwada lets out 509TMC water towards Telangana||AURANGABAD: Marathwada, known as a drought-prone region, has released a record 509 TMC of water towards Telangana state from its different overflowing dams so far this monsoon, said the officials of the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) on Thursday. This has been attributed the surplus showers in the region this year. The water release is the highest-ever from Marathwada and is almost one-third of the entire combined designed live storage of different dams in Maharashtra (1,440 TMC). The record release of water is also more than six times the live storage of the Jayakwadi dam, which is one of the largest dams in the state, and almost twice the cumulative storage (260.3TMC) of different dams in Marathwada. S K Sabbinwar, the superintendent engineer of the Command Area Development Authority of the GMIDC, said the Babhali barrage in Nanded district alone has released around 483.9 TMC of water towards the southern state since June 1. “Discharge of water from some of the key major irrigation projects in Marathwada — including the Vishnupuri dam, Yeldari dam, Siddheshwar dam, Lower Dudhna dam, Manar dam, Majalgaon dam and the Jayakwadi dam — along with several other reservoirs and barrages goes towards Telangana via Babhali. Heavy to very heavy rainfall activity, especially in September, had initiated water release from these dams. In the majority of the projects, water release is continuing even now,” he said. Sabbinwar said other significant dams catering to Marathwada, like Manjra, Lower Terna and Isapur together with other reservoirs have released at least 25 TMC water towards Telangana via routes other than Babhali. Marathwada, comprising eight districts, has received 1,066 mm rainfall since June 1, which is 153% of the normal showers here. All the 11 major irrigation projects in Marathwada were simultaneously releasing the water by Thursday morning. The GMIDC officials said further water release from Marathwada to southern regions of the country is likely given that more rainfall is expected during the withdrawal phase of the monsoon. “GIMDC’s flood management system has been working round the clock as per the rainfall forecast and alerts to ensure smooth operations of reservoirs,” the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mwada-lets-out-509tmc-water-towards-telangana/articleshow/86846630.cms||Prasad Joshi

The team was released after the PM’s departure. Dobriyal told TOI, “Protesting farmers have been mowed down but neither the PM nor the home minister is willing to comment on the issue. While the PM takes to social media over almost every issue, he has completely ignored the blatant act of crime, in which senior members of his party are involved.” Elsewhere, social activists questioned Modi’s visit to AIIMS-Rishikesh on Thursday and inaugurating the oxygen plants across the state when assembly polls are due in a few months. The oxygen plant is for “BJP which is lying on ventilator”, said Praveen Singh Kashi, a social activist who raised his voice against exorbitant fee being charged by AIIMS Rishikesh in 2017 and forced a reduction in treatment rates. He claimed that lakhs of people died due to lack of oxygen when the Covid pandemic was at its peak, then why inaugurate the oxygen plants now.

Wherever the option for going with the KV’s is not feasible, these schools would be handed over to the state government or be developed under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. This follows the recommendations of the principal economic advisor of the Union ministry of finance, Sanjeev Sanyal and its approval by the Cabinet. The Cabinet Secretariat has sent the recommendation to Railway Board for implementation and which in turn has sent them to all zonal railways including the North Central Railways (NCR) headquartered in Prayagraj. The Indian Railways presently runs 94 schools providing education to children of railway employees as well as to the children of non-railway employees. In fact, as of 2019, only 15,399 railway wards were enrolled in the schools which is less than half of the total number of non-railway wards enrolled (34277). Besides, Indian Railways also supports 87 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV’S) where 33,212 railway wards and 5,386 non-railway wards are enrolled. It is to be noted that the total number of railway wards in the age bracket of 4 to 18 years is 7,99,703 i.e., less than 2 per cent of railway wards attend railway school. Historically, the schools were needed to be set up because there was a market failure in the areas where new railway lines and workshops were being built. The geographic concentration of the Railways schools is not necessarily concentrated in the most deprived parts of the country. Moreover, other schools including private ones now exist in places where there are railway colonies. Sanyal’s recommendations say that operating the railway schools takes up a large amount of time of the railway management where core competence is running and maintaining the railway service. "Thus, we recommend minimising the time of railway management in running schools except where they are necessary. The committee recommends that wherever possible, Railway schools be brought under KVS with a quota for the children of railway employees which is the most preferred option," suggests the report. Closing down of railway schools was also recommended by the Bibek Debroy committee on restructuring railways (in 2015) which was of the view that so far as the needs of railway employees are concerned, there are efficient ways of subsidizing the education of their children in alternative schools including KVs and private schools. Sanyal recommendations also say that where KVS cannot run the railway schools, they could be handed over to respective state governments with the preference to children of railway employees. Besides, where appropriate, the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model may also be explored. The recommendations come with a rider that there may be certain remote areas where Indian Railways need to run schools, and there it may continue to do so. Commenting on the development, chief public relation officer (CPRO), NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma said, “We have received the letter from the Board and would be taking suitable steps as and when required as per the instructions of the Board."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/indian-railways-to-merge-its-schools-with-kvs-or-state-schools-across-country/articleshow/86819895.cms||---

Bus driver Sudhir Mohan Kagade (38), a resident of Katraj, sustained a head injury after the men hit him using a blunt object, said police. Kagade later lodged a complaint with the Sahakarnagar police for offences under Sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his/her duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. Senior inspector Swati Desai told TOI on Thursday that police accessed CCTV footage from a camera close to the spot and obtained the registration number of the car. “We have sought details of the car from the Regional Transport Office and are searching for the two suspects. As of now, we have no clue about who they are,” said Desai. She said the bus was heading towards Swargate from Katraj and stopped at the Ahilyadevi bus stop under the Dhankawadi flyover. The two men in the car were driving behind and about to overtake the bus, which then began moving to the right to get into the BRTS corridor. This left little room for the car to manoeuvre as the bus driver failed to spot it. The two men then drove ahead and stopped the bus. “They pulled the driver out and assaulted and abused him,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-in-car-stop-pmpml-bus-assault-driver/articleshow/86850981.cms||Gitesh Shelke

District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal visited the Saptashrungi Devi Mandir in Vani, a gurdwara in Shingada Talao, and the Badi Dargah at Kazipura in Nashik city as these religious places had also reopened on Thursday. Though the yatra — the annual fair — has been canceled this year due to the Covid-related restrictions on gathering of crowds, the number of devotees registering themselves online and visiting the temples stood at about 6,500 till Thursday evening. The district administration and the Shree Saptashrung Niwasini Devi Trust at the Saptashrung Hills, which has the shrine of the Sapatshrungi Devi, had made elaborate arrangements for the pilgrims visiting the temple on the first day since the reopening. “Early in the morning, rituals were performed in the temple by Vardhan Desai — the president of the trust who is also the district judge and the additional sessions judge — and his wife. This marked the ghata sthapana of the Navaratra festival. People from across the state and country visit the shrine during this period,” said Sudarshan Dahatonde, the manager of the trust. Bhujbal and MLA Kalwan Nitin Pawar also visited the temple in the morning. The administration has made arrangements to allow 1,200 visitors per hour by issuing online passes. The pass-holders should carry fully vaccinated certificate or the negative report of an RT-PCR test done within the past 72 hours. If they do not have either of these documents, they will have to undergo rapid-antigen testing (RAT) for Covid. “We conducted more than 400 RATs on Thursday. Two people were found to be positive and they were sent to the Covid care centre,” said Kapse, the tehsildar of Kalwan. The flow of the pilgrims to other temples — like Trimbakeshwar and Kalaram temples — was relatively on the lower side. The Shri Trimbakeshwar Devasthan Trust had made arrangements for 500 pilgrims per hour, but there were very few devotees visiting the temple on Thursday. “We saw very low footfall on Thursday. Perhaps people are also cautious considering the spread of the infection. Throughout the day, about 500 people visited the temple,” Santosh Kadam, one of the trustees, said. The number of pilgrims visiting the Renuka Mata mandir at Chandwad and at Bhagur, the Kalika Mata mandir in Nashik city was considerably on the higher side. All these shrines had made arrangements as per the government guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-shrines-reopen-most-visitors-at-saptashrungi/articleshow/86846697.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the latest set of instructions issued, the association has said store owners must avoid crowding at their counters and insist on use of masks by their employees as well as customers. PDRA head Sachin Nivangune said, “We appeal to customers and all citizens to ensure that Covid rules are followed diligently.” Nivangune said that shopkeepers in the areas near religious places should be more alert. “Shops should refrain from occupying additional space on footpaths and roads and should not indulge in acts that can attract unnecessary crowds. Entry in shops should be given to a limited number of customers only. We have been issuing fresh instructions to local associations of shopkeepers. Their officer-bearers will be asked to take regular follow-ups,” he said. PMC officials said squads have already been constituted to keep a watch at marketplaces. But shopkeepers have urged the PMC and police department not to target them. Prakash Baheti, a shopowner from Somwar Peth, said, “Many times, shopkeepers are held responsible for crowding on footpaths outside shops. Shopkeepers cannot take any action against people standing on footpaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shopkeepers-told-to-increase-vigilance-as-festive-season-starts/articleshow/86850939.cms||Sarang Dastane

We have been given priority in the Mercedes-Benz global supply chain for semiconductor chip supplies, but we still expect waiting periods of around 8-16 weeks for some of our models, if not more. We hope to see the situation ease out, but we will not be able to completely eliminate the supply challenges,” Schwenk said, while speaking on the sidelines of the launch of the new S-Class, the first of which rolled out from Mercedes-Benz’s Chakan plant on Thursday. The diesel and the petrol versions of the new model have been priced at Rs 1.57 crore and Rs 1.62 crore, respectively. The firm announced that its retail-of-the-future set-up, where the company would handle all sales directly, with its dealers handling only deliveries and services, will be rolled out fully in the ongoing month. Schwenk said all of its franchise partners were supporting the company in the new set-up. On the recovery, Schwenk said, “When the situation eased out in June, we decided to go all out and give a push to the market by launching new vehicles. We have seen very good business in both new vehicles and customer services, which indicates pent-up demand. The July-September period was one of the best quarters that we have had.” On the e-vehicle market in India, he emphasized on the need for proper infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/recovery-swift-but-chip-shortage-can-hurt-volumes/articleshow/86850931.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

SC asks UP for report||NEW DELHI: Taking up the violence and deaths in Lakhimpur Kheri, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the UP government to furnish information on action taken by it in the aftermath of the incident that claimed lives and on how many people have been booked and arrested in the case. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli asked the state government for a status report by Friday after UP additional advocate general Garima Prashad informed the court that the state had already appointed a Special Investigation Team to conduct a probe as well as a judicial commission of inquiry headed by a retired Allahabad high court judge. Recording the statement of the state government, the bench also asked it to inform how many people have been named in the relevant FIR and how many were arrested so far. The court said it will first go through the response of the state government before proceeding in the case which has been initiated on the letters written by two Supreme Court advocates in which they brought the incident to court’s notice. Eight people were killed in the violence on Sunday. Of them, four were farmers who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles allegedly driven by BJP workers, some of whom were beaten to death by the agitated farmers. Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish was alleged to be in the vehicles or driving one of them. During the course of hearing, the court was informed that the mother of one of the victims Lovepreet Singh was in critical condition, due to the shock of the loss of her son, and an oral prayer was made to provide her best medical treatment. Accepting the plea, the bench passed the order and said, “In view of the above, we direct the additional advocate general to look into the matter personally and provide best medical treatment to the mother of the deceased in a reputed government medical college/hospital in UP.” The bench during the hearing clarified that the apex court did not take suo motu cognisance of Lakhimpur Kheri violence as had been reflected in the Supreme Court cause list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-many-booked-held-for-kheri-violence-sc-asks-up-for-report/articleshow/86855584.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Under the PSA technique, oxygen can be produced from ambient air by concentrating it. According to the Central government, the 1,100 oxygen plants that have been commissioned are providing an output of over 1,750 MT oxygen per day. The PM said the newly inaugurated oxygen plants were “vital healthcare infrastructure for larger public benefit.” During the peak of the second wave of Covid-19, hospitals across the country had reported oxygen shortage, resulting in several deaths. Lauding the country’s fight against Covid-19, the prime minister said it will be a matter of pride for every citizen that over 93 crore people have been vaccinated and the figure will soon cross 100 crore. “India has shown the way to the world by building platforms like the CoWIN platform and how vaccination is carried out on such a large scale,” the PM said.

It will be ready within a month’s time, said a senior official involved in the ward restructure. Earlier, the state government had declared one-member ward system for municipal corporation elections scheduled across the state early next year. After revision to the the three-member ward system, the civic body from Thursday again started work for preparing the rough plan. “The three-member ward structure will add 12 new wards to the city,” said the official.Currently, NMC has 151 corporators representing 38 wards (prabhags). Ward no. 38 has three corporators, while 37 prabhags have four corporators each. In the new three-member ward system, the 50th ward will have four corporators. The restructuring of prabhags will be done as per the 2011 population census. Population of a ward is expected to be up to 45,000. But in the last 10 years, the number of houses and population has increased significantly. All these factors will be considered while forming the ward, said the official.Sources, however, said that looking at the current status, it seems very difficult that the polls will held in February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-may-have-50-wards-for-civic-polls-next-year/articleshow/86846785.cms||---
---||Nagpur||No Durga idol immersion in lakes, only 2 tanks provided||Nagpur: Like Ganesh idols, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to ban immersion of Durga idols too in water bodies. Idols can be immersed in artificial tanks along Sonegaon lake and Gandhisagar, confirmed solid waste management’s nodal officer Dr Gajendra Mahalle. Green activists feel that providing only two artificial tanks will prove inadequate to promote eco-friendly immersion. Like Ganesh idols, the NMC has restricted the height of sarvjanik Durga idols to 4 feet while for homes it is 2 feet.However, organizers said that the NMC has issued the notification very late while they have already started preparations. Many mandals have installed more than four feet tall idols. Dr Mahalle said that the NMC had issued the notification about height restrictions and other dos and dont’s for the nine-day Navratri celebrations just two days ago on October 5. The civic body was waiting for the state government’s notification in this regard. “The government issued the order only on October 4. Hence, the civic body got delayed in issuing the orders,” said another senior official. On the lines of Ganeshotsav, the NMC has also banned any cultural events including dandiya and other cultural events and instead appealed to the Mandals to conduct health related activities like blood donation camps etc.Arrangements should be made for darshan of goddess through local cable network, websites and social networking sites, the civic body has said.Dr Mahalle said that the two artificial tanks will be sufficient for immersing about 1,000 idols. He also pointed out that the Nagpur city police have given permission to 465 mandals to install idols.Sources said that as heights of most of the idols will be more than four feet, it will be herculean task for NMC to ensure immersion in only artificial tanks. Environmental activists too are of the same view.Calling for separate strategy for goddess idol immersion, green activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “In case of Ganesh idols, 80% are from homes, which can be immersed in artificial tanks. In case of Devi immersion, most of the idols are of mandals which are of 4 feet height, if not more. Hence, we need huge artificial tanks.”Temporary steel tanks will not be able to take the load of water column plus weight of idols. Many such tanks had started leaking after immersion of small Ganesh idols.“We need bigger artificial tanks of RCC structure, but currently there are only two. If all lakes are barricaded, immersion of goddess idols will be a challenge,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-durga-idol-immersion-in-lakes-only-2-tanks-provided/articleshow/86846817.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, the couple started living separately from April 26, 2019, owing to differences of opinion and incompatibility. After all reconciliation measures failed, the couple presented a joint and voluntary petition through their lawyers, Mayur Salunke and Ajinkya Salunke, 14 days ago seeking divorce by mutual consent. Judge M R Kale observed in her ruling on September 29 that both the parties have already undergone a period of separation for more than 18 months. As such, there was no need to make them wait a further six months for the cooling-off period as stipulated under Section 28 of the Special Marriage Act, the judge said. The judge further observed that the wife had waived off her right to maintenance, and that both husband and wife will not have any claim on each other’s property, both movable and immovable. The judge said that there was also no dispute regarding stridhan and other articles, and that there were no claims pending against each other. The judge said the marriage counsellor too had filed a report stating there was no possibility of a reconciliation between the couple. As such, this was a fit case for grant of decree of divorce by mutual consent, the judge ruled. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that the six-month cooling-off period can be waived in case there is absolutely no chance of a reconciliation between an estranged couple. The marriage can be legally terminated in just a week, especially in cases where the couple had been living apart for more than a year, the Supreme Court’s order had said. The Supreme Court order had stated, “The amendment was inspired by the thought that forcible perpetuation of status of matrimony between unwilling partners did not serve any purpose.. The Supreme Court order further added, “The object of the cooling off period was to safeguard against a hurried decision if there was otherwise possibility of differences being reconciled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/techie-couple-get-divorce-within-14-days-of-petition/articleshow/86851032.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Dehradun||'Coach' dupes cricketers promising spot in Uttarakhand teams, held||DEHRADUN: The owner of a cricket academy and coach in Dehradun, Kulbeer Rawat, was sent to judicial custody on Thursday following his arrest earlier this week for allegedly being part of a gang that duped budding players on the pretext of securing them a spot in state teams, including the Uttarakhand squad. Online chats of the gang members with each other that are being investigated mention names of some Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU) officials. “We are yet to find any link between CAU and the accused. It is being probed,” said Umesh Kumar, investigating officer and sub-inspector in Gurugram police. CAU spokesperson Sanjay Gusain said that its officials had no links with the gang. “No one in the cricketing circles has heard of Kulbeer Rawat,” he said. The arrest, however, has revived concerns raised by former Uttarakhand coach Wasim Jaffer of irregularities in team selection. Jaffer had written to the association in February, claiming interference and bias from CAU officials and “promotion of undeserving players”. The officials had then accused Jaffer, the all-time highest run-scorer in Ranji Trophy, of choosing players based on their religion. Several players had sprung to Jaffer’s support. Following the controversy, Jaffer had resigned. The investigating officer told TOI they were yet to find an instance where a person managed to secure a place in a state team with the gang’s help. “But we did find that a few years ago, Rawat had used his connections with a selector to help two players make it to the Sikkim domestic team. The selector has been served a notice by the Gurugram Police to join the investigation,” he said. Rawat was arrested on October 3 after a case was registered in a Gurugram police station on August 24 following an investigation by the Economic Offence Wing (EOW) against directors of Secure Corporate Management (SCM). The company would tell players that they worked with cricket bodies. The case was filed on the complaint of Anshul Raj, a resident of New Palam Vihar, who alleged that he was duped of Rs 10 lakh by the accused promising to secure a place in the state team. On September 4, police had arrested three directors of SCM — Ashutosh Bora, his sister Chitra Bora and another director Nitin Jha. During investigation, police found that the accused had transferred Rs 10 lakh to Rawat’s account. Rawat has a criminal history and has been to Tihar jail in connection with a fraud case. He was also arrested in 2019 by Uttarakhand police with an illegal pistol. His bail application in this case is pending before Gurugram court.

On a number of herbivores being put in one enclosure, Wildlife Research and Training Centre (WRTC) director Dr Shirish Upadhye said, “As the enclosure is big enough, these herbivores fighting for space is unlikely.”The animals were part of the exchange programme between National Zoological Park (NZP), Delhi, and FDCM. On October 2, Gorewada Rescue Centre dispatched two female tigresses and a pair of sloth bears to the NZP, and all the herbivores were transported to Nagpur in the same vehicles.“As per the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) norms, all the animals have been put in quarantine for at least 30 days. The animals are stressed after around 1,000km journey by road and need rest. All these animals will be released in the safari park after 30 days,” said divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai.“After a month, we plan to bring back four more sambars and eight sangai, called as Manipur brow-antlered deer or Eld’s deer. This endemic deer species is only found in Manipur and is also the state animal,” said FDCM officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gorewada-park-gets-albino-blackbucks-barking-deer/articleshow/86846845.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Sarpanch ‘kills’ newborn tiger cub, held while striking deal||Nagpur: A sarpanch and a graduate working in a two-wheeler showroom were arrested on Wednesday night for poaching a newborn tiger cub which they had allegedly lifted from a forest area in Saoli range in Chandrapur district.The accused have been identified as Chichbodi sarpanch Lomesh Dable and Kalidas Raipure, Masala (Daryapur), who works in Chandrapur. In the last three months, the Nagpur forest officials have arrested 31 accused in separate tiger poaching cases.Acting on a tip-off, a team led by ACF Narendra Chandewar caught both Dable and Raipure red-handed with body parts from Padoli near Urja Nagar on Nagpur-Chandrapur state highway.“Based on intelligence, our team was trailing the accused for the last 10 days. As we learned that they were trying to sell the body parts near Butibori MIDC, a team led by vigilance RFO Fanindra Gadewar arrested them. Both admitted that they were trying to strike a deal in Chandrapur itself,” said deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada.According to forest officials, Dable doubled up as a tantrik and used tiger body parts to earn easy money. His farm is an encroachment on forest land and the cub was picked up from the forest in May when the mother tigress must have been away in the forest for hunting, they said.During interrogation, Dable is learned to have told the officials that he hid the cub in the makeshift hut on his farm and tried to keep it alive. Forest officials are not ready to believe his theory and apprehend the cub must have died due to starvation. The dried carcass of the cub had small nails and whiskers, and its teeth were also intact.ACF Chandewar said, “We are trying to find out whether the accused are linked to earlier poaching cases.”“It is really shocking that how Saoli range forest officer (RFO) Vasant Kamdi and field staff were unaware about the whereabouts of the cubs and tigress. When tigress with cubs is reported, protection needs to be enhanced. The incident occurred in May and the staff was unaware about it for four months,” said Uday Patel, honorary wildlife warden of Gadchiroli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sarpanch-kills-newborn-tiger-cub-held-while-striking-deal/articleshow/86846825.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Dehradun||Modi calls Dhami friend, says brave Uttarakhandis pride of defence forces||Dehradun: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Centre had cooperated with the Uttarakhand government on all matters and asserted that the “double engine” of development will take the state to new heights. In an apparent poll pitch for the BJP, as the state goes to elections early next year, the PM said that joint efforts of the central government and the state would help fulfil dreams of people. He pointed out that it was under the tenure of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee that Uttarakhand was created as a separate state. Uttarakhand was carved out of UP in November 2000. While terming chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami as his “friend”, Modi tried to strike a chord with the youth, saying that the “brave Uttarakhandis are the pride of our defence forces.” “I have been closely connected with the land of Uttarakhand,” said the PM, adding that he was glad to be in ‘Dev Bhoomi’ on a day, when exactly 20 years ago, he had assumed charge as the Gujarat chief minister. Modi also lauded the Dhami government for its vaccination efforts despite the tough geographical locations. “The effective management of Uttarakhand government has ensured that health teams reached the remotest of locations. I’m happy to announce that soon the state will achieve 100% success for the first dose. Vaccination drive in Terai and plains is easy, but carrying it out at fast speed in tough geographical locations is an achievement,” the PM said. Underlining the work done under the Jal Jeevan Mission, Modi said that only 1.3 lakh houses in Uttarakhand had pipeline water connection earlier but in two years, the number has shot up to 7.1 lakh houses. The PM said a number of demands had been fulfilled by the Centre that would benefit the state, including one rank one pension for veterans, and various infrastructure projects. He said good connectivity was the wheel of development and through Char Dham all-weather road project, Karnprayag-Rishikesh rail project and major air connectivity projects, sincere efforts have been made in this direction. “Work done for air connectivity has benefited the people of the state. Dehradun airport had a passenger capacity of 250 and it has been raised to 1,200 passengers. Under CM Dhami’s leadership heliports are being promoted in the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/modi-calls-dhami-friend-says-brave-uttarakhandis-pride-of-defence-forces/articleshow/86846836.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Mauritius ex-PM gets new life at AIIMS, says don’t self-medicate in Covid||NEW DELHI: If I am alive today, it is because of the doctors and nurses at AIIMS and the government of India, an emotional former prime minister of Mauritius, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, told TOI in an exclusive interview on Thursday. Despite being a doctor, Ramgoolam said he had committed the mistake that he had always cautioned others about — self-medicating. “When I developed symptoms of Covid-19, I did not visit the hospital immediately,” he revealed. “I treated myself. It led to complications. The doctors at the Mauritius hospital I was taken to advised me to go to the UK or India for better treatment. I chose India.” Ramgoolam, 74, was brought to Delhi on a special medical evacuation flight on September 9 and admitted to the AIIMS Trauma Centre as advised by the government of India. His condition was serious at the time of admission because he had severe lung damage and required high levels of oxygen support. “My condition was bad. Very bad. But the doctors at AIIMS, especially professor Guleria (Dr Randeep Guleria, AIIMS director), helped turn the situation around,” said the former PM, who is set to return to his country later this week having recuperated from the illness. About his experience and advice to people, Ramgoolam said, “One should see a doctor quickly on developing Covid symptoms and get vaccinated. There are many people who are wary of vaccination but at the end of the day it is important, especially for older people.” The veteran leader wasn’t fully vaccinated when he got infected. In Mauritius, the local government claims that around 100 people have died of Covid since the pandemic began. However, Ramgoolam said the data wasn’t reliable. “The government has been saying a person died in the hospital but it wasn’t due to Covid. I ask people, if you have diabetes and you have a car accident and you die, now would you say the death happened due to diabetes or car accident? That’s what the difference is all about,” he said. With Covid cases decreasing in India and other parts of the world, many people can be seen without a mask in crowded places even. The septuagenarian pointed out that the pandemic was not over yet. “There is always a risk of another wave. The more the virus circulates, the more it will mutate. We may have a new virus,” he added, cautioning again against letting the guard down. “We have to maintain social distancing, wear mask and practise sanitation measures,” said Ramgoolam. The Mauritius national served as the prime minister of his country from 1995 to 2000. He was elected again as prime minister in 2005. He added that prior to the second Covid wave, many people roamed around freely without following the necessary precautions and attending festivals and rallies, leading to the rapid spread of the viral infection. “The governments have to issue guidelines and implement them with efficacy,” he suggested. The former PM has an old connection with India. His ancestors, it is said, hailed from Bihar. In 2008, Ramgoolam had visited the state where he also unveiled a life-size statue of his father, Sir Seewoosagar Ramgoolam, who served as the first chief minister, prime minister and governor-general of Mauritius at various times.

---||Rajkot||Two from Rajkot held for sheltering cheating scam accused||RAJKOT: The Rajkot city police on Thursday arrested two persons for allegedly sheltering an accused involved in credit cooperative society scam in April. Police said that Manish Bera (42) and Vinod Bera (61), both residents of Rajkot, have been arrested for providing shelter to Deepak Kotadiya. Katodiya is one of the accused in the multi-crore Ashish Credit Cooperative Society scam. Police also arrested Kotadiya who was on the run since a complaint was lodged against him and others in April this year. Kotadiya had purchased a flat, two shops and a car from the siphoned off money, the cops said. Interestingly, the two arrested on Thursday — Vinod and Manish — had convinced Kotadiya to transfer these ill-gotten properties in their names. The duo told Katodiya that in case he gets arrested, the property belonging to him would be seized by the authorities. Earlier, in April, an FIR was lodged against administrators and agents of three credit societies in April for allegedly siphoning off over Rs 50 crore invested by mostly daily wagers. The accused targeted sweepers and other lower-middle class people. Police had arrested Pradeep Davera, Divyesh Kalawadia and Hitesh Lukka after a complaint was lodged against them by Rajesh, one of investors, who had lost Rs four lakh. The probe revealed that the accused had duped over 350 investors. “We have initiated the process to seize the property of Deepak Kotadiya which was purchased by using illicit money,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-from-rajkot-held-for-sheltering-cheating-scam-accused/articleshow/86848919.cms||---
---||Goa||12-year-old Curchorem girl codes Gandhiji’s image||PANAJI: Asha Koudi, a Quepem-based school student of Class VII, may look like any other kid enchanted by the world of coding. However, at age 12, she is already ahead of her batch of whiz-kids. Using the technique of free form drawing she has coded a picture of Mahatma Gandhi using a second-hand smartphone, leaving her teachers highly impressed at her expertise. “I had enrolled in a drawing contest for Gandhi Jayanti and was not happy with what I had drawn on paper. I decided to try coding it instead on my uncle’s phone. I realised that coding an image of Gandhi is much easier than drawing it. It took me only three hours to code the image,” she told TOI. Koudi started learning coding this year itself and created the image in her first attempt. She and her batch of 45 coding students were initially taught only how to code shapes like squares and circles on a computer. Koudi on the other hand decided to make an attempt to go beyond shapes and draw free form. There are constant issues with connectivity in her area owing to which Asha and her cousins trek up to the top of a hill near her residence to work on the borrowed smartphone. She is now attempting to draw birds and animals through coding. “She is able to use her own skills to build codes with the basic courses that we have given her. Despite their financial status being not so sound, her parents have arranged for a smartphone for her. Though other students are comfortable with the laptop using a block-based programming language, Asha has managed to do it on an android phone using the pictoblox app,” Koudi’s teacher Pallavi Naik said. She is one of the four computer teachers that trains students at the New Educational Institute, Curchorem. Her parents — Irappa, a factory worker and Anita, a housewife — have little knowledge about coding but are already elated with the response their daughter’s attempt at coding is drawing. Despite her newfound talent that is likely to open new avenues for her, Koudi intends to study law in Belagavi after completing her schooling. “It is my father’s dream to see me become a lawyer,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/12-year-old-curchorem-girl-codes-gandhijis-image/articleshow/86853171.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nagpur||State nod to 615-bed superspeciality hospital at Indora||Nagpur: A year after submission of a detailed plan, the MVA government on Wednesday accorded cabinet approval to the two decades old mega hospital project at Indora.Now named as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Superspeciality Institute of Medical Education and Research (DBSIMER), it was to be built at Rs1,124crore as per the 2020 estimate, but the cost stands revised at Rs1,165cr.Work on the 615-bed tertiary care hospital coming up on seven acre land off Kamptee Road is expected to start by March next year. As per current estimates, construction work for the 11-storey twin blocks, for which Nagpur Improvement Trust is the nodal agency, is likely to take at least three years.Currently, only OPD services are offered at the Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital and Research Centre (BAHRC) which would be called DBSIMER after completion of the project.Multi-departmental involvement and scrutiny, beside the government’s focus on handling the Covid second wave kept the approval pending. On October 27 last year, TOI had reported about the revival of the dream project of district guardian minister Nitin Raut. Five new superspeciality courses, one more PG department and one dental OPD were added in the plan. It also included 47 additional beds which took the final count to 615 beds, 11 superspeciality and 17 PG courses.Also BSC, MSc nursing and paramedical courses under the same project were proposed on another 8-acre land nearby. Cabinet approval for them is awaited.For the last one year, the departments of planning, finance, social justice and medical education reviewed the project which envisioned construction of more than 9 lakh sq ft. The government resolution with regard to DBSIMER is expected in the next couple of weeks. “Once the GR is released, a high-level meeting led by Raut is likely to be held. The planning span is long because of micro-detailing. Ensuring electrical appliances in wards, OTs, maintenance, power load, design is a time-consuming process but it has to be foolproof,” officials said.Originally, a Rs1,280 crore plan was submitted but manpower and other requirements were brought down to make it Rs1,124crore project. During the scrutiny additional grants were allocated which took the final cost to Rs1,165crore.The proposal for nursing and paramedical institute would be worth around Rs250cr as per the current estimate.“During Covid pandemic, an acute shortage of specialist doctors at government hospitals was felt in Vidarbha. To remove this deficiency and offer top class healthcare services to patients, I had been pursuing the project for several years. Today, it has been approved by the MVA government,” Raut said in a press release.Right now, the superspeciality hospital at GMCH is the only facility offering such services to patients from not just Vidarbha but also Central India. The new hospital would be on par with GMCH and the fourth government healthcare facility beside IGGMCH and AIIMS-Nagpur. The project is expected to ease pressure on GMCH and IGGMCH to a large extent.

The minister’s son, Ashish Mishra, has been summoned by the SIT. “Among the unnamed accused in the (farmers’) FIR, six have been identified so far. Three of them had died on the spot. Two others — Lav Kush from Banbirpur and Ashish Pandey from Taranagar — were arrested on Thursday,” a police statement said. ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI, “They will be produced in court.” Earlier in the day, IG (Lucknow) Laxmi Singh said, “They revealed the names of three persons involved in the incident. We cannot arrest them because they are dead. We have gathered important leads from the two persons we are questioning.” On Thursday morning, the Supreme Court had asked the UP government to file a report on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence by Friday. A single-member judicial inquiry panel of retired high court judge Pradeep Kumar Srivastava was announced on Thursday. It will submit a report in two months. The SIT initially announced, meanwhile, had six members — Kheri additional SP Arun Kumar Singh, who was at Banbirpur village that day, two deputy SPs and three inspector-rank officers. In the evening, a new setup was announced — DIG Upendra Agarwal will oversee the probe, with PAC commandant Sunil Kumar Singh as a senior member and ASP Singh as a member, along with the others. A technical consultant is also part of the team. DGP Mukul Goel told TOI, “A nine-member committee headed by a DIG-rank officer has been formed to ensure an impartial and transparent probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident … I sincerely hope that the committee will ensure probity and help expedite the probe as soon as possible.” The reason, IG Singh told TOI, is that the “ambit of the case has turned vast,” adding, “An ASP-rank officer posted in the district was supervising the probe but now this monitoring committee will oversee the probe.” Meanwhile, a notice, asking Ashish to be present at the Kheri crime branch office at 10am on Friday, was pasted outside his house. “Ashish Mishra has been summoned for questioning,” IG Singh said. A media report quoting a relative of the minister had said Ashish had left Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. When asked, ADG Sabat said, “The investigation team is looking into it.” Significantly, police also said empty cartridges had been found during a sweep at the site of the killings in Banbirpur. “On Wednesday, the site of the incident was examined by the forensic team. Two empty .315 cartridges were found. On Thursday, metal detectors were used at the spot again,” a police statement said. While the families of farmer Gurwinder Singh and journalist Raman Kashyap, killed in Sunday’s violence, said the bodies had bullet holes, the autopsy report did not mention any gunshot wounds. Eyewitnesses TOI spoke to -- and reported by this newspaper -- had said “over 10 shots” were fired, that those in the convoy were the ones who fired and that the sound of bullets went off for hours when the two cars were burnt down, hinting that cartridges inside the vehicles may have combusted.

---||Pune||Pune: Man gets five-year RI in rioting, murder case||PUNE: Additional sessions judge G P Agrawal on Thursday convicted and sentenced Old Sangvi resident Vyankatesh, alias Balaji Subramaniyam Mudliyar (45), to five years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) for causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon to the complainant in a case related to rioting, unlawful assembly and murder on September 13, 2001, at Vadgaon Sheri in Yerawada. The judge acquitted Vyankatesh of the murder charge owing to lack of evidence. Along with his brother and main accused Sainath and five others, Vyankatesh was named in the FIR relating to murder of Vadgaon Sheri resident Pradeep Thumbe and subsequent assault on three others, including Pradeep’s brother, Pravin, and mother, Kusumbai. He was on the run for 18 years before being arrested in January 2019. “The court had split the trial against Vyankatesh, subject to his arrest. Sainath died during the pendency of trial. The remaining five accused were acquitted by the court on September 16, 2017. A separate trial was conducted against Vyankatesh following his arrest,” additional public prosecutor Sunil S More told TOI. Apart from the five-year term for the offence of causing grievous hurt, the court handed out RI terms varying between three years and one year on the counts of rioting; rioting with deadly weapon; unlawful assembly and mischief. All these sentences would run concurrently with the main sentence. The judge took a lenient view while sentencing the convict, considering his age and the fact that he was the sole earning member of his family. Vyankatesh is in jail for the past three years. The court referred to the September 16, 2017, judgment that acquitted the five co-accused of murder on the grounds that the deposition by the victim’s brother and another witness were not reliable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-gets-5-year-ri-in-rioting-murder-case/articleshow/86851093.cms||Vishwas Kothari

Meanwhile, he slipped to Ahmedabad and from there he went to Dholera before reaching Palitana. Our team tracked him down at a lodge in Palitana on Thursday morning,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime). Jain was brought to the city Thursday afternoon and he also underwent rapid Covid test that turned out to be negative. “We have arrested him and he will be produced before the court on Friday,” Chauhan told TOI. Investigating officials said that they will now get crucial clues in the rape case as the co-accused and complainant’s statements were contradicting each other. “Jain will be questioned about the spy camera that was installed at the girl’s residence and the memory card that has all the data. He will also be asked about the places where he stayed while on the run and who helped him,” the police added. Meanwhile, bootlegger Alpu Sindhi was nabbed along with his friend Dharmesh alias Golu by the crime branch from a housing colony at Gurgaon in Haryana on Thursday. He was wanted in a prohibition case but the crime branch had been looking for him as Sindhi is a friend of the rape survivor and a key witness in the case. The girl had mentioned Sindhi in her statement to the police earlier. The police have already arrested Raju Bhatt, co-accused in the rape case, along with his friend Kanji Mokariya, who helped him in fleeing from the city. The girl, who is studying law in a private university in the city, had filed a complaint of rape against Jain and Bhatt in Gotri police station last month. She alleged that Jain, at whose firm she was undergoing training, spiked her drink and molested her. He later visited her residence again and raped her. Bhatt too has been accused of raping the girl and threatening her of dire consequences.

The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) standing committee has sent a letter to the state government in favour of the demand. “These funds should be released at the earliest, so that the civic body can complete the pending development works,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the BJP-led PMC’s standing committee. The letter stated that Rs272.32 crore was due in terms of the surcharge from October 2019 to March 2021, while Rs 58.41 crore was pending from April 2021 to June 2021. Besides, the letter stated that around Rs193.11 crore should be given to the civic body as its GST share. Funds to the tune of Rs736.2 crore for the development of 11 villages merged with the PMC were also pending, the letter said. A PMC official said financial aid from the state was one of the key revenue sources and an important aspect of budgetary allocations. The NCP, which is a part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), claimed that the state was awaiting funds from the BJP-led Centre. “The BJP leaders should do a follow-up with their higher-ups. The state’s funds of around Rs1.25 lakh crore are due with the Centre. Once this is paid, it will be easier for the state to clear the PMC’s dues,” NCP legislator Chetan Tupe said. As per the PMC standing committee, Rs8,370 crore was proposed for the municipal budget for the ongoing fiscal year. The budget is inflated by Rs720 crore as compared to the Rs7,650-crore draft budget presented in January this year. Data shows that the civic body has earned around Rs3,000 crore from property tax and building permissions in the past six months. The civic body now hopes to earn Rs6,000 crore from the municipal budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-seeks-rs-1096cr-from-state-govt-as-gst-stamp-duty-share/articleshow/86851139.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

As the South Western Railway (SWR) is likely to eliminate the level crossing - in lieu of which the RUB has been built a few hundred metres away – the road traffic will be diverted through an alternative road leading to the RUB. Deputy collector (revenue) Rochell Fernandes and deputy collector, Quepem, Nilesh Dhaigodkar, inspected the RUB and its approach roads. During the inspection, the district administration officials asked the Railways to explore the possibility of building an additional alternative road with a view to decreasing the density of traffic on the existing village roads following the closure of the level crossing gate. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/officials-inspect-rail-underpass/articleshow/86851166.cms||---

Salaries of September weren’t paid to the employees as the MMC coffers were empty as admitted by the chief officer.  “We struggled with staff salaries as tax collections have dropped considerably due to non-payment of taxes and huge amounts outstanding in the form of arrears,” the chief officer said. However, with business establishments not coming forward to clear their dues despite a public appeal in that regard, Fernandes said that MMC will now act tough and seal shops which have not paid up taxes. He said that the work of serving notices will be completed by October 15, and after a week the process of sealing of shops and business premises of defaulter as well as of those running the trade without a trade licence will be taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-civic-body-staff-get-salaries/articleshow/86851189.cms||---
---||Delhi||Broken dreams: Home is where heart isn’t for Kashmiri Pandits||NEW DELHI: Ashok Trisal, a Kashmiri Pandit and secretary of Kashmiri Samiti Delhi, harboured a wish to return to the valley home he was forced to leave three decades ago. After Article 370 was scrapped in August 2019, he believed that the door to Jammu and Kashmir had reopened. The gunning down of a prominent Kashmiri Pandit on October 5 has killed all such hopes. Trisal, 52, who left Pulwama in Kashmir in the 1990s, recalled, “I was 18 when my family had to flee in the middle of the night. We left everything behind. When I visited Pulwama in 1994 under army protection, I found that my house had been razed by militants.” In a low voice, Trisal said his parents died without fulfilling their wish of making Kashmir their home again. He too has now given up the idea. “How is it possible given the situation in Kashmir?” he asked. For most Kashmiri Pandits, a return home is now a distant dream. Ratan Kaul, 65, president of Public Diplomacy Forum, said, “My heart beats for Kashmir but we have no home, job or security in Kashmir, only bullets awaiting us.” She added, “It is difficult after having rebuilt our lives outside Kashmir to return to a place filled with uncertainty.” The recent killings of civilians has left community members anxious. Bansi Razdan, 64, who lives in Dilshad Garden, asked, “If the terrorists can murder such a prominent businessman as Makhan Lal Bindroo, will they spare us? By killing him, the militants want to send a message to others to stay away from Kashmir.” Some families, however, haven’t ever wanted to go back. Advocate Ramesh Wangnoo, for one, declared, “In the past 30 years, it never occurred to me that I should return. We were betrayed by our friends and neighbours and it is difficult to establish trust again.” For 70-year-old C L Misri, a retired BSF personnel, returning home means being a veritable foreigner among the locals. While posted in Kashmir, militants had barged into his house and he only just escaped from the rear door. “Nearly 30 years have passed since then. Now, the people back there will not recognise us. The children with whom we played will not have any memories of us,” he said. The young people too are alienated from the Valley. Rohini resident Shivani Peshin, 34, was two years old when her family fled Srinagar. “I visited Srinagar for the first time in August and couldn’t relate to the place. All I saw was police, army and CRPF everywhere. I can move freely in Delhi but I don’t know what will happen in Kashmir in the next five minutes,” she said. Likewise, lawyer Aditya Raina, 32, has no memories of his native Seer Jagir village in Sopore and said only his grandparents’ generation hankered to return to Kashmir. “I have no emotional connect with the soil of Kashmir. I can go there on holidays,” he smiled. The much younger Dhruv Wanchoo, 19, a law student, added, “I will think of relocating only if the Valley becomes a safe and peaceful place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/broken-dreams-home-is-where-heart-isnt-for-kashmiri-pandits/articleshow/86851217.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

However heartening as it may sound, the numbers add up to just 28% of the 9.14 crore eligible beneficiaries in Maharashtra for both doses.Uttar Pradesh with 2.29 crore fully vaccinated people comes second, followed by Gujarat, Karnataka and West Bengal. State public health department officials said the vaccination campaign planned in Maharashtra from October 8 to 14 will add to the numbers. The government is also rounding up beneficiaries due for their second dose as well as those who have not started their vaccination schedule. A senior public health department official told TOI, “Discussions are on at the higher levels of the department to increase beneficiary numbers by bringing into the vaccination schedule those who have still not taken the first dose. Getting people to take their second dose is of utmost importance if we have to increase the number of fully vaccinated citizens in the state.” The state is likely to get two crore vaccine doses this month, and higher the vaccinations conducted, greater will be the dose quantity that Maharashtra is likely to receive, he added. State Covid-19 task force member Shashank Joshi told TOI that though the state had done well in some geographies like Pune, Kolhapur and Mumbai, rural Maharashtra is lagging behind. “There are many districts with some degree of vaccine hesitancy, particularly the rural parts. Therefore, Maharashtra still needs to vaccinate aggressively, and try to complete two-dose schedule of maximum beneficiaries by the year-end. Rural vaccine hesitancy must be addressed as soon as possible,” Joshi added. Uttar Pradesh with 2.29 crore fully vaccinated people comes second, followed by Gujarat, Karnataka and West Bengal.

The raid was performed as part of the ‘zero drugs’ campaign launched by SSP Abhishek Yadav on Wednesday. This came almost a year after Muzaffarnagar police caught a gang involved in manufacturing and selling fake protein powder with labels of the top US and European brands in November 2020. According to superintendent of police Arpit Vijayvargiya, “After a tip-off, a police team from city kotwali police station and SOG raided a location in Kidwai Nagar and busted an illegal factory making supplements. They also arrested one accused from the spot. A huge quantity of the raw material and ready supplements worth Rs 50 lakh were also recovered from the factory.” According to sources, the police arrested Asif Saifi, the owner of the factory, while an accused Javed Saifi managed to flee. During interrogation, the accused told the police that they used to prepare supplements for brands and supply them to gyms and shops. Police are now trying to find the gyms where these supplements were being supplied. According to SSP, since the drive against drugs has been launched, drugs worth crores have been recovered and many accused have also been arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/fake-protein-supplements-worth-rs-50l-recovered-in-mnagar/articleshow/86849114.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Kotak added that the release of sewage into the lake must be stopped, new saplings must be planted in place of trees that had been cut, and water hyacinths must be cleared out from the water body. The MP further said the lake was frequented by leopards and was also home to crocodiles. “In light of this, the BMC must take all steps to conserve the lake,” he said. BJP MLA from Charkop, Yogesh Sagar said it was unfortunate that the lake was being ruined despite it being the pride of Mumbai and home to crocodiles and many other animals. “Is this Aaditya Thackeray’s love for environment? Action must be taken against the municipal commissioner and mayor for using harmful chemicals to clear the hyacinths,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-bjp-mp-urges-bmc-to-drop-powai-cycling-track/articleshow/86854205.cms||---
---||Goa||Revise med form, Goa Aids society tells hotel institute||Panaji: Goa State Aids Control Society on Thursday requested the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM) to “revise its format for medical certificate with immediate effect” as the current format seeks disclosure of HIV status of students seeking admission which is “in violation of the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act 2017”. Project director of the society, Dr Geeta Kakodkar said that the act extends to the entire country and requested that the format which seeks disclosure of status of HIV in the medical certificate be revised with “immediate effect” and that the institute update the society over action taken. Goa Human Touch foundation which works in the area of HIV and sexual and reproductive health, TB and substance abuse flagged the discriminatory medical certificate by the institute which makes HIV testing a prerequisite for obtaining education in “blatant violation” of the act. IHM’s principal, in response to the foundation, said that the “institute is governed by the national council for hotel management and catering technology (NCHMCT), Delhi. The matter has been forwarded to the council for their advice and direction”. “The medical certificate form has acted as a barrier for one of our adolescent’s living with HIV who was aspiring to seek admission for her higher education in IHM, Goa,” founder, CEO of Human TouchFoundation, Peter Borges stated in his communication to the society and the institute. “The fear of HIV status being revealed in the process of admission and whether fitness would mean exclusion of those living with HIV created a lot of anxiety for the adolescent, who ultimately did not attempt the admission. We demand that this medical certificate form be revised or withdrawn at the earliest,” Borges stated in the letter. “A certificate of this kind has no merit in the schooling system as it perpetuates discrimination and rejection,” said Dr Bilali Camara, medical epidemiologist, UNAIDS and country director for India stated in a letter to the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revise-med-form-goa-aids-society-tells-hotel-institute/articleshow/86851203.cms||---

Minister of state (MoS) for home affairs, Rai, was in the city to attend a function organised to mark the 29th formation year of Rapid Action Force (RAF). The event was held at RAF Academy for Public Order (RAPO), the country’s first police academy for riot control and public order management. As Rai, who was chief guest at the event, was leaving the stage, the reporters started asking questions about the deaths of farmers. It was then that DG Singh, who was following the minister, turned back and told the reporters, “Aap irritate kyu karte hai? Aap ko yeh karna hai bahar kariye jaakar (why do you irritate. If you have to do it, do it outside).” The 19-second video was widely shared on social media platforms, where it invited criticism. Shiv Sena spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote on Twitter, “Exactly the problem. When CRPF DG ‘defends’ an MoS Home. How can the Lakhimpur investigation be fair while Ajay Mishra Teni ji continues to be MoS Home, same as Nityanand Rai ji & uniformed officers feel obligated to ‘defend’ them. MoS needs to step down or should be asked to.” Meanwhile, during the event, while referring to the terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, MoS Rai said that steps have been taken to prevent such attacks and the security situation in the Valley is under control. “After these attacks, the security situation in the Valley has been reviewed,” he said. The minister also said that soon RAF will be deployed in natural calamities like floods etc. According to the RAF, a total of 30 units with 60 personnel each, have been trained as first respondents for natural or man-made disasters like flood rescue operation, earthquake rescue management, chemical, biological, nuclear disaster rescue operations. They will be deployed in all 15 battalions of the RAF across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dont-irritate-dg-crpf-tells-reporters-asking-minister-about-kheri-incident/articleshow/86849151.cms||Ishita Mishra

The Panaji station received the maximum amount of rainfall on Wednesday of about 176.6 mm, with five other stations receiving more than 100 mm in one day, which can be considered as extreme rainfall category. The lowest rainfall was recorded at the Canacona rain gauge station with 67.6 mm. “Thunderstorm frequency is maximum during the post monsoon period in the month of October and a secondary maxima occurs during the pre-monsoon period in the month of May,” said meteorologist and retired NIO scientist, M R Ramesh Kumar. This monsoon contributed to about 7% of the mean annual rainfall for the state of Goa. The Northeast monsoon (October-November) rainfall was 15% excess in 2020 and 174% excess in the year 2019, which incidentally was also the year of cyclones as far as north Indian Ocean is concerned. “Five cyclones formed in the Arabian Sea as compared to three in the Bay of Bengal. It is these cyclones which travelled parallel to the west coast of India, which caused copious precipitation in Goa and resulted in excess of 174% rainfall in the post monsoon. This is a record in itself,” Kumar said. The year 2018 had 41% deficit rainfall, so was case with the year 2016 when Goa had 51% deficit, and 2015 had a deficit of 38%. The year 2014 on the other hand had 55% excess rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-heavy-showers-excess-rainfall-in-goa-surges-to-168/articleshow/86851244.cms||---

Goa is a happy state and there is not much water scarcity, but we should plan for the future by preserving biodiversity,” he said. He said the National Institute of Oceanography has prepared a detailed report about Goa’s wetlands and will be made available on the website of the wetland authority soon. In North Goa, Dashi Lake in Revora and Toyyar lake in Chimbel and in South Goa, Sarzora lake in Salcete and Nanda, Cottambi, and Xeldem lakes in Quepem became the first six notified wetlands in Goa. “The six notified wetlands is a significant step to conserve, manage and to maintain the ecological character of the wetlands without curtailing and restricting the legitimate and wise use of these ecosystems.

---||Thane||Thane: VGN Jewellers owner arrested for multi-crore deposit fraud||THANE: The managing director of VGN Jewellers has been arrested on charges of duping nearly 20 investors of over Rs 15 crore by promising higher returns on their deposits in various schemes. Virath Gopalan Nair was arrested by the economic offences wing of Thane police on Tuesday. The magnitude of the multi-crore scam is likely to widen --- the total number of victims could be around 50,000 and the fraud could be of well over Rs 100 crore, said Sunil Lokhande, DCP (EOW). In 2019, two Keralite brothers who owned Goodwin Jewellers were arrested for defaulting on similar schemes. V G Nair, also originally from Kerala, established himself as a reliable jeweller in the city in the 80s and is popular among the Malayali community, which trusted and invested with him. VGN Jewellery stores were established in Mulund, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, among other places. As the news of Nair’s arrest spread among investors, they started flocking to the EOW office at the police headquarters here to record their statements, said a police officer. “Presently, around 20 investors have approached the EOW and recorded their statements and more victims will be coming in the next few days,” Lokhande told TOI. A senior police officer told TOI that the scam started in 2006 with the accused luring clients with various schemes that offered good returns on their investment. “In one scheme, a client had to pay Rs 500 for 24 months (amounting to Rs 12,000) and they would get Rs 14,000 or gold jewellery of that value back. Another scheme, which belies belief, was assured 15% annual interest on deposits spanning from 1 to 5 years,” said a police officer. Some of the investors told cops they had invested their life’s savings only to realise they have been cheated. Last month, Nair was booked, along with his wife and son, for fraud and a case was registered with the Kolsewadi police station in Kalyan. The case was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), and 406 (criminal breach of trust), along with other sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act. The police have again urged citizens not to fall prey to such schemes offering unbelievable returns as there is every chance of getting cheated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-vgn-jewellers-owner-arrested-for-multi-crore-deposit-fraud/articleshow/86853302.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Earlier in the day, the convoy of hundreds of vehicles, cars and SUVs coming from Mohali and carrying Congress workers and scores of state ministers, came to a halt at Saharanpur border, where a cordon of policemen in riot gear had blocked the highway with barricades. Senior police and administrative officers, including ADG Saharanpur range and divisional commissioner were also at the check-post. After over two hours of melee in which Congress workers jostled with security personnel to remove the barricades, Sidhu and scores of Congressmen were detained and taken to nearby Sarsawa Air Force station in police vans. Reacting to it, Sidhu said, “I do not understand why we are being stopped. We are not protesting here, though protest is our fundamental right. We just want to go to Lakhimpur Kheri. This government has become autocratic.” Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Saharanpur, S Chanappa, said, “All those who had come here have been stopped in a peaceful manner. We are talking to their representatives.” About six hours later, at 9 pm, Preetinder Singh, DIG of Saharanpur, said, “We have given permission for four vehicles. Occupants will include a few Punjab government ministers, MLAs. Around 300 vehicles that had accompanied this delegation have been sent back.” The cricketer-turned-politician had announced the march a day earlier. He had written on Twitter, “If, by tomorrow, the Union Minister’s son behind the brutal murder of farmers is not arrested, and our leader @PriyankaGandhi being unlawfully arrested, fighting for farmers is not released, the Punjab Congress will march towards Lakhimpur Kheri!” Meanwhile, the motorcade of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was also stopped at Shamli. Hooda along with Congress state chief of Haryana Kumari Selja were going to Lakhimpur Kheri. Later, local police permitted five people to go ahead, triggering a protest. Hooda sat on a dharna protesting the ‘diktat’. “There is a complete ‘goondaraj’ in UP and the government is showing a dictatorial attitude. We demand immediate dismissal of the accused minister,” he said. Later, Hooda returned to Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sidhu-several-pun-ministers-mlas-detained-at-up-border-for-hours/articleshow/86849189.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Ahmedabad||48% hospitals do not have BU permission: Gujarat govt to HC||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Thursday informed the Gujarat high court that its survey has revealed that nearly 48% of total hospitals operational in the state do not have the Building Use permission, which is a pre-requisite for occupancy of any building. The state government has also said that it infers that the BU permission law is likely to be violated by nearly half of the residential buildings across the state. The state urban development and urban housing department has filed an affidavit and stated that for “ascertaining the exact number of such buildings without BU permission, an extensive survey was carried out firstly with hospitals in the state” because it intends to reply to the Supreme Court’s queries in a suo motu PIL, which is scheduled for hearing on October 26. It said, “It was realised that on an average about 48% of the hospitals in the state do not have valid BU permission. It is very much reasonable to infer that similar enormity may prevail as regards other type of buildings including residential buildings in the state, which are without BU permission.” The issue of BU permission cropped up earlier this year during the hearing of a PIL filed by advocate Amit Panchal seeking action against culprits in the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy in which eight Covid-19 patients died in August 2020. The petitioner had also demanded strict implementation of fire safety norms. When the high court turned the heat on the state government for not enforcing the BU permission provisions along with the mandatory fire NOC, the state government said that checking and implementing BU permission provision would be a very lengthy and cumbersome exercise for the state authorities. In August, when the HC insisted on a concrete plan for enforcement of BU permission provisions, the state government came up with a notification saying that it would not take coercive action for violation of BU permission and fire safety norms till March 31, 2020 on account of Covid pandemic. This decision did not go down well with the apex court, which trashed the notification saying that the authorities cannot say that they would not implement the law. The state government came out with a new notification delinking the drive for ensuring fire safety measures from other construction regulations, mainly BU permission, and continued its drive to ensure fire NOC in all buildings that structurally qualify for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/48-hospitals-do-not-have-bu-permission-govt-to-hc/articleshow/86849276.cms||---

While the wastewater study is still in the final phase, the sero-survey is complete. This study can also help predict future waves of viral diseases, before the virus achieves community spread. India’s first large multi-collaborative research project on wastewater epidemiology is underway at the in-house research centre of CIIMS. Initially, this study aimed to know the transmission of Covid-19 but now it is also focusing on other viruses like Rotavirus, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E, Norovirus, Adenovirus, and enteroviruses. CIIMS research team members told reporters on Thursday that initial results are astonishing and they could predict future viral attacks in advance. “We can prepare ourselves for such diseases if wastewater studies get government backing for continuous research,” they said. “This project was conducted between January and August this year. We collected wastewater samples from Nagpur district for a period of six months. We are in the process of finalizing a detailed report of this study. But initially, we have found Covid-19 virus in majority of wastewater samples in all parts of Nagpur,” said Dr Rajpal S Kashyap, senior scientist and director research of CIIMS, who is lead investigator for this study. CIIMS received Rs2.35 crore grant through Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), provided by international collaborative partners University of Nottingham, UK. Municipal wastewater was collected from ten different municipal zones of Nagpur urban, and nullahs, and common effluent points from 13 talukas covering entire Nagpur district. The collected wastewater was processed at B Lal Institute of Biotechnology, Jaipur, which carried out nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) extraction and subsequent analysis for SARS COV-2. CIIMS research team found that the number of wastewater samples with SARS COV-2 was less during January but started increasing from February onwards. Up to 89% of samples were positive during April and May, while this number reduced again from July-end. According to researchers, wastewater analysis gave them an early idea of virus exposure in the population. “The estimation of viral RNA copies of SARS COV-2 in the environment can be taken as an indirect indicator of the amount of population exposed to Covid-19 disease in particular locality, region or city,” said Dr Kashyap, adding that a bigger and comprehensive study can be beneficial for the nation. Dr Lokendra Singh, director of CIIMS Hospital, said the institute also carried a sero-survey analysis of around 1,000 blood samples collected from different municipal zones of Nagpur to correlate community exposure of SARS Cov-2 with wastewater data. BOX HEED IMMUNITY IS HERE * CIIMS study brings Nagpur-specific Covid-19 data * Majority of wastewater samples were positive for Covid-19 before second wave hit hard * Blood sample-based sero survey shows over 70% Nagpurians had Covid-19 infection * Out of 400 non-vaccinated people, 70% had natural antibodies * Out of 600 vaccinated subjects, 85% plus have vaccine based antibodies * Overall, Nagpur is heading towards herd immunity now||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ciims-study-shows-ngp-near-herd-immunity-can-help-predict-future-waves/articleshow/86849280.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Housing society made to pay for breaking court seal on flat||MUMBAI: After office-bearers of a housing society on Napean Sea Road broke open locks at one of two flats sealed by the court commissioner in July 2019 to fix a leakage, the Bombay high court appointed a court receiver to take “actual physical possession” of both flats. Though the treasurer and secretary undertook to tender written apology expressing regret and assuring there will be no such repetition in future, Justice Gautam Patel on Wednesday directed “the society will, as a token of its regret and as a demonstration of the sincerity of that regret” give Rs 1 lakh to NGO Welfare for Street Dogs for its anti-rabies programme. The Bombay Parsi Punchayet had moved the HC on October 1 urgently since the balcony door of one flat at Meherina complex was open and its keys were with the HC prothonotary (a court clerk) and senior master. Justice Patel directed that the keys be handed to the BPP’s advocate. The BPP had been appointed administrator to the estate of Sorab Modi, who died a bachelor in September 2016 and left a will for sharing his estate. In 2019, an inventory was made and the flats sealed. On Wednesday, Justice Patel was shocked when the BPP’s advocate said the commissioner’s seals had been broken. He asked the society’s office-bearers to remain present. The society’s advocate said during the lockdown, there was a leakage. So it broke open the door of one flat. “Most alarmingly, even the commissioner’s seal on the cupboards have been broken. The old teak doors of the cupboards are damaged... some items from the inventory such as crockery, etc are missing,’’ said Justice Patel, after looking at photos. He added: “The assertion that there was an emergency during the lockdown is unacceptable. Even during the pandemic, this court was functioning on all its sides.” Also, the society knew of the BPP appointment as administrator and did not bother to contact it or even move HC. Justice Patel directed the society to pay the court receiver for repairs, including of the doors, change of locks, etc and also for costs of cleaning up the flat strewn with debris and construction material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsg-soc-made-to-pay-for-breaking-court-seal-on-flat/articleshow/86854224.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The bus was on its way from Ghaziabad's Kaushambi to Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh and the accident occurred between Gajraula and Brajghat near Shahbazpur Dor village in Amroha district on Wednesday night. Six passengers were injured. Soon after the bus’s gearbox caught fire, apparently due to a short circuit, passengers broke the windshield and window glasses and most of them jumped out. A woman got trapped in a seat. Her leg was stuck and she couldn’t move. The fire spread swiftly and she was soon charred to death. For Kallu Singh and his young family, it was a narrow escape. He along with his wife Renu and seven-year-old son Prem Kumar from Kasam Nangla of Rampur district sustained minor burn injuries and were provided treatment at a local health centre. Kallu told TOI, "We were on a roadways bus. There were 57 passengers. All of a sudden, smoke started emanating from the gearbox. A fire broke out minutes later. Passengers broke open the windshield and some of them jumped out. The driver also left and the bus veered off and fell into a roadside trench." "A woman was charred to death in front of us. We couldn't take her out," he added. On Thursday, Amroha SP, Poonam (she uses her first name only), said, "A woman died in the bus accident. She seems to be in her 30s and is yet to be identified. At least six passengers sustained injuries. They were admitted to a local hospital for treatment and are out of danger now." No FIR has been no lodged yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-charred-to-death-six-injured-after-bus-from-ghaziabad-catches-fire/articleshow/86849266.cms||Harveer Dabas

Paddy fields was affected in Mayem, Piligao, Mulgao, Karapur, Pale, Nanora and other areas, including Bicholim town. Sakharam Pednekar, a farmer from Mayem, said agriculturists have been facing acute losses since the past two years due to heavy rainfall. “This year as well, paddy cultivation was destroyed due to heavy showers, putting farmers in an acute financial crisis,” said Pednekar. “If the rain continues, then it will be very a tough time for us,” said another farmer Kashinath Mayekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-damages-paddy-fields-in-bicholim/articleshow/86851284.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Merit predominates, comes first: HC on PSI promotions||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has asserted that merit should be the only consideration in the matter of promotion in government department where the candidates have to appear in examination to qualify for promotion. The case before the high court was for promotion of head constables to the post of police sub-inspector. When the high court witnessed the state government’s decision to retain 52 head constables, who apparently did not qualify during re-evaluation, and there were33 odd candidates who claimed that they had scored better than those selected for promotion, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati observed that the government must remember that it is merit only that should prevail. The bench observed, “It is merit and merit alone which should be the sole consideration. Merit predominates. Merit always comes first when it comes to promotion. It is a well-settled principle that equities will follow the law; equities at the most may supplement the law but equities cannot supplant the law.” In this case, in 2017, the state government came up with an advertisement for 376 posts of unarmed PSI,which were to be filled by way of promotion to those head constables who have already spent 15 years in service. The government agency held a test for qualification and the result was declared. The declaration of result led to uproar because many candidate expressed dissatisfaction over the result. The high court ordered re-evaluation of question papers. After re-evaluation, there were 52 candidates who could not get to the qualifying score to be included in the merit list. From these 52, there were 41 candidates who were declared failed altogether. However,there were 33 other candidates who came up before the high court and claimed that they had scored more than some of those whose name had already figured in the selection list. Four years later, when nearly1,660 vacancies appeared for PSIs, the government decided to include the 33meritorious candidates, who could not fine their place in the 2017 selection,in the new list. However, the state government decided to retain those 52 head constables as PSIs, though they did not show merit in the exams in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/merit-predominates-comes-first-hc-on-psi-promotions/articleshow/86849282.cms||---

The foreign ministry also expressed concern over reports about vandalisation of a gurdwara in Afghanistan. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India expects the international community to insist on the fulfilment of objectives mentioned in the August 30 UNSC resolution on Afghanistan. According to reports, Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul was vandalised two days ago. “Obviously it raised concerns not just for us, but I suppose across the world. It is important that the international community continue to insist on the fulfilment of goals outlined in the UN security council resolution,” Bagchi said. The UN security council resolution on Afghanistan was adopted on August 30 and it, among other things, reaffirmed the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities, and encouraged all parties to seek an inclusive, negotiated political settlement. Condemning the “targeted killings” in Srinagar, the official said India was discussing cross-border terrorism at meetings with partners and also steps the international community should take".The official described the resumption of flights from Kabul to India as a complicated and sensitive issue. “There are various factors that need to be taken into account,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/india-slams-pakistan-over-terrorism-gurdwara-vandalisation-in-afghanistan/articleshow/86855628.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp stares at a mammoth task of data cleansing||Thiruvananthapuram: With the opposition emphasising the fund fraud in zonal offices as theft of property tax paid by the residents, the civic body has been forced to undertake a much needed data cleansing exercise covering 4.5 lakh tax assessments. While Mayor Arya Rajendran told the council on Tuesday that the data updation will be completed within 30 days, officials who have long dealt with an incomplete database of tax admit that it is going to be a much harder task than it looks. In 2020, as Covid drove away people from offices and former Mayor K Sreekumar appealed to the public to make use of online services, the TOI had reported as to how numerous residents were in for a shock since dues from previous fiscals were shown in the respective accounts of people who never defaulted on tax payments as they tried to make payment online. The latest report submitted to the urban affairs director regarding the issues in tax data, highlight lack of proper database and delay in proper updation (posting) as two major issues which have led to data inaccuracy regarding tax payment. The addition of wards following delimitation, rearrangement of wards, tax revision which marked a shift from annual rental value to plinth area necessitated huge transfer of data, updation of information. It so turned out that in many cases, the updation and transfer was incomplete which led to a situation where people have to furnish previous tax receipts while paying for a specific fiscal or else their accounts will show arrears of previous financial years. With data cleansing and posting requiring enormous manpower and time, the corporation officials often updated the data whenever people came for other certificates and were required to pay the tax. Now the swindling of funds in zonal offices has triggered panic among city residents despite repeated assertions by the Mayor that nobody will lose money. However, with past arrears still showing up on the system, in spite of payment being done, the corporation has no other way but to update the system and publish the actual arrears. During the data cleansing exercise, the corporation will have to settle with its own team of bill collectors since posting of data is done using authorised username and password. Hiring of manpower on a temporary basis would lead to issues regarding data security and possible chances of tampering with the system. Even during all these years, bill collectors, often reeling from work load, have failed to update daily collections on the system promptly. A 30 day deadline would be a challenging task for the revenue team . The corporation will have to rely on the daily collection register and tax receipt book being maintained in all offices to match the payment records of each resident and then update it on the web. BJP parliamentary party leader M R Gopan has also reported about data inaccuracy. “Prior to the election, I paid around Rs 20,000 and all dues were cleared. When I checked in the office regarding tax for present fiscal, the entire amount which I had paid in 2020 is still showing as arrear. This is not an isolated case,” he said. Union suspends accused staff: The zonal office staff, who were recently placed under suspension for alleged swindling of funds, were suspended pending inquiry by Kerala municipal corporation staff union. A press note issued by the union demanded legal action against those involved in the fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-stares-at-a-mammoth-task-of-data-cleansing/articleshow/86819026.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Cotton damage: Farmers gherao Punjab finance minister’s house at Badal||BATHINDA: Upset that the farmers who lost cotton crop to pink bollworm had neither compenstion nor the sight of any action against the suppliers of spurious seeds and pesticides, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) broke thorugh the security cordon of Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Thursday to lay siege to his village house at Badal. For the last three days, they had been protesting near the minister’s house for compensation. On Thursday, the farmers first asked the cops on duty at 2pm to remove the barricades but when the security team declined, the farmers ran through these obstacles. Sometime after their dharna outside the house, a team from the Muktsar district administration came over to them to seek a day when they’d like to sit with the state government for talks, because for now, most of its functionaries were on the way to Lakhimpur Kheri and they as well needed time to make any decision. Punjab had 3.04 lakh hectares under cotton this year, and 1.70 lakh hectares of this was in Bathinda and Mansa districts, where the pink bollworm had struck. The cotton that survived is fetching more than Rs 7,000 for each quintal, against a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,925 for 27.5-to-28.5-millimetre long staple. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) state secretary Shingara Singh Mann told TOI: “Appeals from the Muktsar district administration has moved us away from the minister’s house till Friday morning. If by then, we don’t have a concrete assurance on compensation, we will lay siege to the house again. On September 26 also, the farmers were assured compensation, there is no sign of which 11 days on. We also want the suppliers of spurious seeds and pesticides brought to book for causing this massive loss to the farmers.” Reports of the pink bollworm attack had brought Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to the Bathinda villages and ask the agriculture department to complete a girdawari (revenue assessment) for distribution of compensation to the affected farmers. A revenue department official said on the condition anonymity that this revenue assessment was in progress and the farmers will not have to wait long for compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-surround-fm-house-at-badal-for-cotton-compensation/articleshow/86851342.cms||Neel Kamal

The accused, Arvind Yadav, 25, told the cops that he was directed by one Raju Patel from Palanpur in Banaskantha to hand over the truck to a person in Ahmedabad whose identity was not known to Yadav. According to Yadav, the consignment was loaded in Jaipur in Rajasthan and was to be delivered in Gandhidham in Kutch. Sources in CID said that they got input that a truck carrying Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) bottles was moving from Mehsana towards Ahmedabad. The cops deployed at Nandasan Crossroads in Mehsana waited for the truck and asked the driver to stop the vehicle when it reached there. But, the driver tried to dodge the police and drove the truck speedily towards Adalaj-Mehsana highway. The cops immediately swung into action and chased the truck in two police vehicles. Finally, the police overtook the truck on Adalaj-Mehsana highway and when they checked the vehicle found around 5,000 liquor bottles inside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-chase-truck-in-filmi-style-seize-liquor-worth-rs-40l/articleshow/86849312.cms||---

Following the state government implementing the policy, the Gujarat high court on Thursday disposed a PIL demanding 4% quota for the physically challenged people. Petitioner, the National Federation of the Blind, had sought HC’s directions to the state authorities for calling for the records relating to the maintenance of roster for giving effect to 3% reservation for persons with disabilities in terms of the Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights And Full Participation) Act, 1995 and the Supreme Court’s judgment, and about the 2016 amendment that included 1% quota for persons suffering from blindness and low vision. The details have been sought since 1996. The demand has been made to quash recruitments in which the rule of 4% quota has not been followed. Petitioner’s advocate S H Iyer said that the government has agreed to their demand of 4% quota for people with disabilities as well as the demand to furnish the records. “The question, however, is about the recruitment drives which have been already over,” he said by quoting a Supreme Court’s order, which called for a special drive to induct those candidates with disabilities who were left out during the recruitment drives which have been completed. The lawyer raised the issue before the HC, but the judges opined that the state government has met with the primary demands raised in the PIL. For other demands, the petitioner may approach appropriate forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-brings-policy-of-4-quota-for-people-with-disabilities/articleshow/86849331.cms||---

Water from the entire catchment area of the Khandepar River turned red on Thursday morning. Opa water works have recorded the water turbidity as high as 530 NTU on Thursday morning. Officials at Opa Water Works have claimed that this is second time the plant has recorded high turbidity since the June flooding when the plants were submerged in the area. On June 22, the turbidity level was at 500 NTU. High turbidity levels, however, increase the workload of plant staff as they have to clean the clogged filters repeatedly. The filters quickly become non-functional due to the density of water sediment and hence the staff needs to backwash the filters. On Wednesday afternoon, the water turbidity level was 62 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit). Prior to this, the plant witnessed high turbidity on June 22 (over 500 NTU). Water containing 1 milligram of finely divided silica per litre has a turbidity of 1 NTU and up to 50 NTU is considered as normal unit. Nivruti Parsekar, an executive engineer of water division who overlooks supply of potable water to Ponda and Tiswadi talukas, said the wash-off from surrounding areas that drains into river with rain water, flows down to Opa catchment area which leads to rise in turbidity. He said the phenomenon is common during the incessant rains along the areas on the banks of Khandepar River, but though there was a rise in turbidity, water is safe for consumption. “Water is released to consumers only after proper filtration at Opa Water Treatment Plant,” he added. After raw water is drawn into a receiving chamber from the river, it flows into sedimentation tanks to allow settling of the silt. Next, the water passes through three stages from sand filter beds to the chlorination plant and into the main balancing reservoir for storage and supply. Sometime consumers get reddish-like coloured water which is because of some fine particles that remain in water even after filtration, but it's not harmful, Parsekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heavy-downpour-in-catchment-area-turns-opa-water-turbid/articleshow/86851312.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Journalist Siddique Kappan files contempt plea in Supreme Court||AGRA: A contempt plea has been moved before the Supreme Court by journalist Siddique Kappan alleging violation of his medical rights and the apex court’s orders by UP government officials who got him discharged from the hospital and shifted him to jail in May though he was still Covid positive and had very high blood sugar levels. The plea filed on Wednesday alleged that Kappan is losing his eyesight as his diabetes had reached a critical stage and that he is in pain and requires hospitalisation. Kappan, a Delhi-based journalist from Kerala, was arrested by Mathura police on 5 October, 2020 while on his way to cover the gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district. He was charged with sedition and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The plea filed by Kappan’s lawyer, Wills Mathews, said that despite the apex court’s direction to officials on April 28 that Kappan be discharged from the hospital only after his recovery, officials got him discharged when he was still Covid positive. “He was shifted to the Mathura jail in clear violation of the Supreme Court’s direction. He had high sugar levels of around 460 mg/dL (normal blood sugar level is less than 140 mg/dL) along with serious dental problems and medical issues,” Mathews told TOI. The plea alleged that he was discharged at a time when he needed treatment for his dental issues because of a fall in the bathroom. “Even now one tooth is hanging and other teeth are displaced and there is serious pain in his veins and nerves," it said. The plea stated that the act of discharging Kappan from the hospital at midnight on May 6 this year and depriving him of sleep amounts to contempt of court. “…The accused is still in need of medical assistance, which was denied to him,” said the plea, adding that the action of the officials in non-compliance of the court is “wilful and deliberate”. After the apex court’s direction on April 28, Kappan was taken to AIIMS from the Mathura prison on the night of April 30. However, just six days later, the journalist was discharged and brought back to Mathura jail hospital on the night of May 7. The discharge summary issued by AIIMS said that he was still positive for Covid-19 and needed 14 days of isolation and treatment. DIG (prisons) Shailendra Maitrey declined to comment on the matter. “I can’t comment on this as I haven’t received any notice so far,” he said. Earlier, on May 9, Kappan’s wife, Raihanath, had sent a notice of contempt to the UP government alleging that it did not comply with the Supreme Court order asking it to provide better medical treatment to the incarcerated journalist at AIIMS or in any other hospital of Delhi. The UP Special Task Force (STF) in its 5,000-page chargesheet had cited stories written by Kappan on anti-CAA protests to claim that his agenda was to “instigate Muslims, stir up communalism and defame the nation”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kappan-files-contempt-plea-in-sc-says-up-govt-denying-medical-rights/articleshow/86849313.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Vishnu also outlined what his priorities would be for the more than 900-member association if he wins as president of MAA for which elections would be held on October 10. “This manifesto also reflects ‘self-respect’ of Telugu film artistes,” he said. Kalyana Lakshmi scheme, old age pensions, KG to PG education, health insurance, life insurance and women’s protection figure in the manifesto. Under Kalyana Lakshmi, Rs 1.16 lakh would be given to the family of MAA members at the time of the marriage of their children. The membership fee for MAA would be reduced from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 75,000 for newcomers. Vishnu said an app would be created with details of all the actors and access would be given to directors, producers, writers and production executives so that roles for actors could be facilitated. A ‘job committee’ would go to production houses, producers, OTT platforms and show the portfolio of artistes for a tie-up with them. Vishnu reiterated that a building for MAA would be constructed with his own personal funds. “We will speak to the chief ministers and cinematography ministers of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana about the needs of MAA,” he said. Health insurance for all members will be paid for by the association itself and a tie-up will be entered into with corporate hospitals for special coverage and benefits to the families of movie artistes in Telangana and AP.

On an average, 1,000 or more people get vaccinated every day with the first dose. A health official, however, said those who are getting their first dose of the vaccines now are primarily outstation employees working in Goa. Among the others are also those who have recently turned 18, while the rest could be people who, despite being eligible, did not get vaccinated. The Goa government drew flak last month after it claimed 100% coverage of its eligible population with the first dose. “All such people are getting their first dose. We will reach near 100% vaccination of the second dose by the end of this month,” the health officer said. On Thursday, over 1,000 people were vaccinated with the first dose, and 6,000-plus received their second dose while a total of 7,447 were vaccinated over the last 24 hours. Between 7,000 and 8,000 people are vaccinated every day. As of Thursday, more than 7.5 lakh people were fully vaccinated, and 4.6 lakh have got their second dose. The state also had around 4 lakh doses in balance. Another official said that Goa is likely to vaccinate much more than its targeted population, as it has a high volume of outstation employees in the organised as well as unorganised sectors. Goa is a tourism state with a large workforce from other states in the hospitality industry. “No sooner than their employees resume work, the employers ensure that they are vaccinated. It is a good gesture, as those workers will be here till the season ends. The same holds true for workers employed on fishing trawlers,” the official said. Tourists and other travellers also choose to get vaccinated in Goa, as the session sites are less crowded, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/outstation-workers-18-year-olds-among-goas-daily-1000-first-jabs/articleshow/86853434.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Cop takes Rs 5,000 to close case, trapped||AHMEDABAD: ACB officers on Thursday caught an ASI of Pethapur police of Gandhinagar for taking bribe from a man to close a missing person complaint. The complainant’s wife had gone to her parents’ house in Dhulia district of Maharashtra but his sister-in-law (his wife’s sister) had an enmity with him so she went to Pethapur police station and filed a missing person complaint. She claimed that her sister was being tortured. The complainant told the ACB that his wife’s sister wanted to harass him over some old dispute, despite knowing that her elder sister had gone to meet her parents. ASI Hasmukh Sharma, who looks after Unava outpost of Pethapur police station, was asked to probe the missing person plea and he called the complainant to record his statement. Unaware of his sister-in-law’s act, he went to the police station and told the cop that his wife had gone to her parents’ place and returned two days back. Sharma demanded Rs 20,000 bribe to close the application filed by his sister-in-law. After rounds of negotiation, the complainant agreed to pay Rs 5,000. He informed the ACB after which a trap was arranged and the accused ASI was caught red-handed taking the bribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cop-takes-rs-5k-to-close-case-trapped/articleshow/86849337.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Doctors who treated ‘injured’ cops, depose before SC panel||HYDERABAD: Doctors who treated the two cops who reportedly suffered injuries during the alleged encounter at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019, deposed before the SC-appointed inquiry commission on Thursday.  Dr G Naveen Kumar, who worked at Community Health Centre (CHC) in Shadnagar, and Dr P Vishwak Sena Reddy of Care Hospital deposed before the commission. Dr Naveen Kumar initially treated the two injured cops —SI Venkateshwarulu and head constable Aravind Goud— at Shadnagar CHC before they were referred to Care Hospital, while Vishwak Sen Reddy treated the SI. The commission’s advocate asked Dr Naveen Kumar on what basis he concluded that the injury Aravind Goud suffered was grievous and he stated that it was based on Care Hospital’s X-ray report. Dr Naveen answered subsequent questions stating that Goud had suffered a fracture of left scapula, but he did not record it in the wound certificate of the head constable. As he did not give a reason for not mentioning the injury in the wound certificate issued by him, the tribunal recorded in the deposition stating that, “in spite of repeatedly explaining the questions, the witness is not prepared to give any reason as to why he did not mention about the injury in the certificate”. Responding to further questions, Dr Naveen stated that he pared down his report based on the report given by an orthopaedic expert of Care Hospital, who had done a CT scan. However, when the commission’s advocate pointed out to him that there was no mention of CT scan in the discharge summary of Goud’s issued by Care Hospital, Dr Naveen said he saw it in the doctor’s notes, which he saw for the first time on Thursday. In his statement before NHRC, Dr Naveen reportedly stated that both the injured cops were conscious, walking by themselves and were not in serious condition. However, in his deposition before the commission, he stated that the injured cops were unconscious when they were brought to the hospital on stretchers. When he was pointed at the contradiction in the two statements, Naveen stated that, “I said before NHRC that they were conscious, able to walk on their own but I stick to what I said before the commission, which is, they were unconscious when they reached the hospital.” Dr P Vishwak Sen Reddy of Care Hospital, who treated SI Venkateshwarulu, after he was referred from Shadnagar CHC, stated that the patient was “conscious, coherent and oriented.” He stated that the SI’s vitals were normal, but he was admitted in ICU for three days as he mentioned about “transient loss of consciousness for about five minutes.” He also said that the Venkateshwarulu suffered simple injury and his fascia bone was exposed. However, the same was not mentioned in his notes or the record for “no particular reason.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/doctors-who-treated-injured-cops-depose-before-sc-panel/articleshow/86851368.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC allows rape survivor to terminate pregnancy||HYDERABAD: Stating that the life of an unborn child cannot be placed on a higher pedestal than that of the life of the minor mother carrying the child, Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana high court allowed the termination of pregnancy in tune with the latest amended version of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act and also the powers of a high court to intervene in such issues. The judge pronounced this order after hearing the plea of a 16-year-old rape survivor who approached the court seeking a direction to a private hospital in Hyderabad to abort the child. The coercive methods of the accused, the threats, and emotional blackmail have restrained the minor from revealing the atrocity to her parents who came to know of her pregnancy at a later stage. The hospital said it needs permission from a court of law as the pregnancy is 25 weeks and is beyond the prescribed gestation period. The DNA samples, blood samples from the mother and fetus shall be sent to a forensic lab for preserving DNA, blood samples, etc. that may be required while trying accused before a trial court, the judge said. If sought by the victim, the HC legal services authority shall assist her in securing compensation, he said. Stating that a woman must have absolute rights in matters such as this, Sravya Katta, the counsel for the petitioner said that the crucial consideration here should be that of a woman’s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity that should be respected. The judge in his order said: “A woman has right to make a choice to carry the pregnancy, at the same time, it is her right not to carry the pregnancy, however, subject to conditions and restrictions enumerated under the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 2021. If the petitioner is not permitted to terminate the pregnancy, there is every possibility of the petitioner undergoing severe physical and mental stress, which may have adverse effects on her future health and prospects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-allows-rape-survivor-to-terminate-pregnancy/articleshow/86851370.cms||---

The court has also directed the police commissioner to take action against the investigator for not putting in efforts to trace out the child. Resident of Sanaval village near Kalol town, Sajanben Thakor, was awarded jail term and was fined Rs 40,000 for the abduction of Tamanna from Kalupur railway station on April 20, 2016. She was arrested on the basis of CCTV footage. She had made acquaintance with Tamanna’s mother Rekha Rajput just a few days before the incident. In punishing her, additional chief metropolitan magistrate B R Rajput said that the child’s mother fell unconscious twice in courtroom during her deposition. “It was heart wrenching to listen to her murmuring when she would get to see her daughter. People like this accused woman send young girls to monsters. There cannot be any place for people like her in this society… Her conscience is dead. Any severity of punishment in such offence is not enough, but to set an example in the society and to give justice to the child’s wailing parents, it is necessary to award maximum sentence the law provides in these offences,” the court said. The court was displeased with the investigator H C Rathwa’s efforts to trace the abducted girl. The court directed the concerned commissioner or superintendent of police to take action against Rathwa for not probing enough to trace the abducted child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-gets-seven-years-in-jail-for-abducting-child-never-found-later/articleshow/86849376.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Gujaratis, Marwaris get set to groove to Navratri beats in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: It was subdued celebrations last year due to pandemic curbs. But this year, the nine-day festival of Navratri has got off to a grand and traditional start. The Gujarati and Marwari communities in the city are gearing up for big dandiya and garba events this year unlike last year’s restricted festivities in small gatherings at apartments. “Since we missed the celebration last year, we are going to make the most of it this time. Dasara festivities every year attract thousands. Most of us are now vaccinated, so we are ready to participate in outdoor festivities and dandiya sessions this year,” said Priyanka Agarwal from the Marwari community. Both the Marwari and Gujarati communities celebrate the festival in a similar fashion, except for a few specific traditions of their own. “One Marwari tradition is that for nine days we keep wheat in a new pot in a corner and add water daily. On the day of Dasara, we use the wheat leaves for puja,” said Bhavna Jain, a resident of Sindhi colony. While it’s well-known that Gujaratis play garba during Navratri celerations, few are aware that there is dance around a garbi at home first. “We place a garbi, which is a decorated matka and with a diya inside, at home first. After puja, every evening the women dance around the garbi and that’s why the dance is called garba,” said Ruchika Kapadia, who organises dandiya and garba events in the city. Prakash Jadeja, who has been organising these festivities for the past several years in the city, added, “According to the ritual, we have been doing ‘Maata ki puja’ and after that start the garba sessions either in our apartment complexes, hotel or convention centre depending on the convenience of community members.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gujaratis-marwaris-get-set-to-groove-to-navratri-beats/articleshow/86851400.cms||---

The minister added that as per FIRs collected from coastal and local police stations, 11 fishermen died in accidents at Muthalapozhi harbour in the past five years (2016-21). The government views the number of deaths seriously, he said. According to the minister, accidents are due to the deposit of sand in the harbour. He informed the assembly that steps are being taken for dredging and increasing the depth as per a memorandum of understanding signed with the Adani group. “Grab dredger has reached the site and dredging will start as soon as the assembling process is completed,” the minister said. An environment impact assessment study will also be carried out to undertake a permanent process of sand bypassing through which sand being deposited in the southern portion could be spread in the northern area which is highly prone to sea erosion. An agreement was signed with a Kochi-based firm and the report will be ready within a year. Detailed project report for sand bypassing will be prepared and work will begin, the minister said. He added that a team of experts led by M V Ramana Murthy will visit Muthalapozhi within a week and prepare a report. The National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, was entrusted with the task of studying the defects in the construction of Muthalapozhi harbour. The minister told the assembly about the loss of shore in the northern portion following the construction of Muthalapozhi harbour. Talking about the sea erosion at Anchuthengu, he said it was up to the Irrigation department to take steps to conserve the shore. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-take-steps-to-solve-muthalapozhi-issue/articleshow/86819048.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 arrested for lynching man; police hunt for 6 others||MUMBAI: Three people have been arrested for lynching a 24-year-old man over suspicion that he had committed a theft. Police said at least six others are involved in the murder. On September 26, police found a nude corpse amid some bushes at Rathodi, Malad West. They did not immediately suspect murder, as there were not many external injuries on the body, apart from a few abrasions. Presuming that he was a pavement dweller and might have died in a hit-and-run, cops sent the body for post-mortem. The autopsy revealed internal injuries, prompting the police to probe the homicide angle. The victim was identified as Chandrakant Vasava. He lived in Nalasopara and was visiting his sister at Malwani. He had spent some time behind bars in a burglary case in the past. Vasava’s family said they did not wish to file a complaint regarding his death. CCTV footage did not produce any leads either. Then, an informant told the cops that a ruckus had been heard from Rajput Marble Compound, which houses dozens of marble shops. “Inquiry revealed that Vasava had gone to one of the shops, Abhinav Marbles, late on September 25. Some workers sleeping in the compound suspected he had stolen a phone and a fight broke out. They summoned others from marble shops in the vicinity and rained blows on Vasava,” said an officer from Malwani police. “The other accused went to their hometowns. Teams have been sent to nab them,” added cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-arrested-for-lynching-man-police-hunt-for-6-others/articleshow/86853544.cms||---

He demanded immediate arrest of Union MoS (home) Ajay Mishra and his son and stringent sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) imposed against them. Chaudhary was in Aligarh on Thursday to address a public rally in Khair area. While speaking to media persons later, Chaudhary said that Mishra should be sacked by the government. “My demand is immediate arrest of the minister and his son and imposition of stringent sections of UAPA against them, as the incident was not less than a terrorist attack.” He added that the “main issue of all elections hereon should be the way the farmers are being martyred by the government”. Chaudhary said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had gone to Lucknow but “did not utter a single word about the Kheri incident”. “It seems that the incident never happened. He thinks that he is the most powerful leader and can never be wrong?” Addressing the public rally, Chaudhary said that farmers were mowed down in Lakhimpur Kheri and police imposed sections of 302 and 120B of IPC against accused “but Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) which was made to stop terrorist activities was not imposed against them”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kheri-incident-no-less-than-a-terror-attack-says-jayant-chaudhary-seeks-uapa-against-min-son/articleshow/86849358.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||DU refutes prof’s claims that Kerala students are being given preference||New Delhi: Following a row over comments on students from a particular state board being given preference by Delhi University during admissions, a statement was issued by the varsity on Thursday refuting the same. DU registrar Vikas Gupta said over 60,000 students had applied to the university under the first cutoff list out of which over 46,000 were from CBSE. At the end of the last day of approvals from college principals, applications of over 31,000 students from CBSE and 2,365 of students from Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education were accepted, he added. There were 1,540 students from Board of School Education, Haryana and 1,429 from Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. The remarks by DU professor Rakesh Kumar Pandey on the “inexplicable rush” of students from Kerala had drawn flak from several quarters. Students’ Federation of India and National Students Union of India announced that they would hold demonstrations at DU’s Arts Faculty and Kirori Mal College, respectively, on Friday. Meanwhile, Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had staged a sit-in protest on Wednesday stating that the high cutoffs had led to students from “only few state boards” being admitted to the varsity. In the statement, Gupta said, “Being a central university, University of Delhi equally and uniformly values the academic credentials of all candidates irrespective of their states and school boards. This year, too, equal opportunity was maintained by accepting applications based on merit only.” Refuting the claim of students from a particular state board being “favoured”, Gupta added, “Being a prestigious central university with a long legacy of quality teaching and research, candidates across the country aspire to study in our colleges, departments and centres. It is our utmost responsibility to maintain justice and equity to all meritorious candidates coming not only from Indian states, but also from abroad.” Nuthan Kiron Raj, a former student of Hindu College and a member of Telangana Students’ Association, said, “Such a statement is derogatory and condemnable. It was a very biased and prejudiced statement. There can be faults in the grading system, but singling out a particular state is unjust. As we don’t have a common grading system throughout the country, there can be differentiated grades. But that doesn’t give anyone the right to give a distorted statement against a particular state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-refutes-profs-claims-that-kerala-students-are-being-given-preference/articleshow/86851576.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Farmers allege 1 hit by BJP MP Saini’s driver when they gathered to protest in Naraingarh||Ambala: While protesting against the visit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Naraingarh of Ambala on Thursday, a farmer, Bawan Preet Singh of Bakala village, allegedly got hit by a vehicle of the convoy of the BJP leaders. The vehicle was allegedly driven by Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini’s driver Rajeev. Bawan received minor injuries in the incident, but angered, the farmers protested outside Saini Dharamshala for about four hours. The farmers did not allow Saini’s brother and many other persons to come out of the dharamshala. Injured Bawan had lodged a complaint against driver Rajeev and MP Nayab Saini and handed it over to Naraingarh deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Anil Kumar. The farmers have given police time till October 10 to take action on the complaint filed. Earlier, farmers had gathered under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni to oppose the visit of MP Saini and Haryana sports minister Sandeep Singh, who was actually scheduled to visit Naraingarh, but did not come and Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma came in his place. The farmers were carrying BKU Charuni and black flags and raised slogans against the government and BJP leaders while demanding repeal of Centre’s three agri-marketing laws and justice for those farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh (UP). According to information, BJP leaders Saini and Sharma came to Saini Dharamshala at Naraingarh to attend an event organised by Saini Sabha to honour Covid-19 warriors. The police had made arrangements to keep protesting farmers at a distance from the event, but they managed to reach near the venue. However, MP Saini and minister Sharma’s convoy had left Saini Dharamshala. The farmers chased the convoy of BJP leaders. Saini and Sharma were in the same car. And the driver of Saini was following when the alleged accident occurred. In his complaint, Bawan alleged, “Driver Rajeev in an attempt to murder him hit him with the car.” He also alleged that after getting hit, he fell on the bonnet of the car and fell down and received injuries. “Rajeev threatened that if we protested again, then they will repeat the incident of Lakhimpur Kheri,” alleged Bawan and demanded action against MP Saini and his driver Rajeev. MP Saini said, “Those people in the garb of farmers chased the convoy and scuffled with the driver. No one was hit by the car. This is false and fabricated. If they have any proof then they should make it public.” Naraingarh station house officer Dhoom Singh said, “Saini Sabha organised an event and the farmers opposed it. They later alleged that a protestor was hit by a vehicle from the BJP leaders convoy. We are investigating the matter, and action would be taken according to law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-allege-1-hit-by-bjp-mp-sainis-driver-when-they-gathered-to-protest-in-naraingarh/articleshow/86851402.cms||---

To ensure maximum vaccination coverage, we have started approaching local religious and community leaders,” said Hitesh Barot, chairman of AMC Standing Committee. Barot said that local religious and community leaders are respected in the areas they belong to and can effectively convince people for vaccination. “The civic body’s health department officials with the help of local councillors are holding meetings with local leaders and we are getting good response,” Barot said. The civic body has held vaccination camps at various religious places. “We have held vaccination camps at Jagannath temple, many Swaminarayan temples, at many smaller temples and now we have started approaching Muslim religious leaders also,” Barot said and added that 96% of the vaccination-eligible population of the city has received first dose of vaccination so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-ropes-in-religious-leaders-to-strengthen-vaccination-drive/articleshow/86849424.cms||---

Five other districts including Raigad, Solapur, Sangli, Nashik, and Sindhudurg collectively have almost 15% of the state's active Covid patients. The number of active Covid cases has drastically gone down in the remaining districts.“That simply means 10 districts have almost 90% of the active Covid patients in Maharashtra,” said state surveillance officer Pradip Awate. Currently, there are a total of 33,637 active Covid patients in Maharashtra. Of them, 24,682 patients (74.44%) are undergoing treatment either at home or in hospitals in Pune, Mumbai, Ahmednagar, Thane, and Satara. And another 4,954 patients (14.94%) are under treatment in Raigad, Solapur, Sangli, Nashik, and Sindhudurg. In 16 other districts, the number of active Covid cases has gone below 100. “In fact, the number has reduced to a single digit in eight of the districts including Nandurbar (1), Gondia (1), Bhandara (2), Dhule (3), Nanded (8), Washim (8), Wardha (8) and Yavatmal (9),” Awate said. Senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “Globally the epicentres of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions have been industrial and education hubs. The five districts in Maharashtra which are contributing the maximum number of cases are either industrial or educational hubs.” “Such cities and towns attract a large number of floating populations with a large number of migrants from neighbouring small towns and villages. Such mass movements affect the transmission dynamics of all contagious diseases including respiratory infections,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/five-districts-have-75-of-maharashtra-active-covid-cases/articleshow/86851435.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh govt orders probe into land leased to AMU by Jat king in 1929||AGRA: The Uttar Pradesh government has ordered a probe into the land leased out to the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) for 90 years by late Jat king Mahendra Pratap Singh in 1929, after a complaint was filed by a local resident claiming that despite completion of the lease period, the land has not been returned by the varsity. Commissioner (Aligarh division) Guarav Dayal told TOI that he has received a letter from additional chief secretary SP Goyal. “I have sought a report from the district magistrate (DM),” he said. Notably, the late Jat king, a freedom fighter and social reformer who donated land to various educational institutes, was an alumnus of the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, which later became the AMU. He had given 3.04 acres of land to the university on lease for constructing a school in 1929. In his complaint filed with the UP CM, president of Aahuti organisation, Ashok Chaudhary, claimed the land which was given to the university on August 14, 1929, through court of ward should be handed over to the state, which is the owner, as per the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1952. He further stated the land should be utilised to construct a state university named after the late king, as a tribute. “Since there was an agreement between the state government and Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh in 1960 that barring lands which were being utilised by him and his family members for personal use, other lands will be owned by the state government,” Chaudhary told TOI on Thursday, adding that as per section 2 (1) C of the Zamindari Act, the state has a right to take possession of the land which is being "misused or is in illegal possession". Incidentally, Charat Pratap Singh, the great grandson of the late king, had served a legal notice to the university in 2018 about the expiry of lease. He had said, “Two pieces of land were given by my great grandfather to the AMU for promoting education. We are donating the bigger land where AMU’s city school is constructed, just to keep the legacy behind and in return the institute will name the school after the king’s name.” Another small piece of land measuring 1.221 hectare had also been freed from the lease. Hence, the king’s family members had demanded that the AMU authorities should either vacate the land or buy it at market price. The AMU's executive council had constituted a committee to look into the matter in September last year. When contacted, AMU spokesperson Prof Shafey Kidwai said, though the executive council was ready with Singh's proposal, a final decision is yet to be taken. “The matter is under process and a decision will be sent to the ministry for its approval.” Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of a university to be named after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh. At least 396 degree colleges in Aligarh division are to be affiliated with this upcoming university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-govt-orders-probe-into-land-leased-to-amu-by-jat-king-in-1929/articleshow/86849401.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Task Force police nabbed the accused at SR Nagar based on a tip-off. Khausurdas Nurmohmad Kholiba and his wife Nahida Khausurdas Kholiba, both Bangladesh nationals, illegally migrated to India. They had stayed in Mumbai and recently shifted to Hyderabad. With the support of an alleged human trafficker, Atiyar Mondal from West Bengal, they decided to carry on human smuggling. Accordingly, they illegally shifted three women from Bangladesh. These three women joined the Bangladeshi couple already residing at Sanatnagar. The couple and the human traffickers allegedly planned to push the three Bangladeshi women into prostitution. The human traffickers were targeting Bangladesh women in financial problems by promising them jobs and good stay. However, after they reach India, they were forced into prostitution. The accused were in touch with local agents, who shift them from one city to another depending on the requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-bangla-nationals-held-for-prostitution/articleshow/86851432.cms||---

Now I live in Gachibowli, but all those years ago it was considered back of the beyond. Also, business ethics and work culture have evolved drastically as have politicians who are now quicker to respond owing to their exposure to modern business practices. Even the bureaucracy I can tell – from the little that I have engaged with it – has an more willingness to act faster now,” said Akbaruddin who is currently the dean of Kautilya School of Public Policy. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/made-the-right-decision-to-settle-in-hyd/articleshow/86851425.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ordinary people’s concerns part of foreign policy today: Syed Akbaruddin||Hyderabad: Foreign policy today is different from the past as it takes into account ordinary people’s concerns like environment, health, digital technology, cyber security among other things, said former IFS officer Syed Akbaruddin on Thursday. His last posting — before he retired in 2020 and returned to live in Hyderabad — was as India’s permanent representative at the United Nations. “Climate change, for one, has become an integral part of foreign policy now. Also, who would have thought health would be so critical,” said Akbaruddin, at the launch of his book India vs UK: The Story of an Unprecedented Diplomatic Win that chronicles the run up to India’s historic victory at the 2017 International Court of Justice elections. It beat UK to win the seat. Borrowing from Hollywood – while speaking about India’s foreign alliances – Akbaruddin said that the phrase ‘frenemies’ coined by them, is how the country needs to work today. Be friends with some nations in some places and “not-so-friendly in some other places”. “Our interests with the US align in many areas like technology, vaccines etc. But then there are areas such as environment where our interests coincide with China’s. India’s approach to climate action, for instance, is very similar to the Chinese. And don’t see any reason why we can’t maintain this balance,” the 1985-batch officer said. Asked if nations, following the Covid-19 outbreak, has become more insular, Akbaruddin said that it was unfortunate that amid such a crisis individuals, states, institutions, international bodies forgot humanity. “Look at how some resident welfare associations behaved during that time. Even my wife was questioned when I returned from New York and stepped into my new house. “She was asked how I was allowed inside the society. And this after being quarantined in a hospital for 10 days and being certified Covid-19 negative. I rest my case there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ordinary-peoples-concerns-part-of-foreign-policy-today-syed-akbaruddin/articleshow/86851406.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Four palace elephants to come to Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Four elephants that belong to the royal family of Mysore will soon be in Gujarat, at the Elephant Rescue Centre in Jamnagar. The four females, in the age group of 27-44 years, will be sent to Jamnagar after the Dussehra festival. The elephants — Rajeshwari (27), Gemini (31), Seetha (36) and Ruby (44) — are owned by the Mysore-Wadiyar dynasty. The royal family has six elephants, of which four are beings sent to the facility in Jamnagar. Vijaykumar Gogi, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Karnataka, said that the forest department has to issue a permit for transportation of the elephant. These are privately-owned animals and the department has only to certify that the elephants are fit to travel. “The forest department has also informed the Gujarat forest about the transfer of these animals.” V Karikalan, deputy conservator of forests, who has asked his veterinary team to examine the elephants, said, “We are to issue fitness certificates after which they will be transferred to Jamnagar. All the elephants were rescued from a circus and the royal family had volunteered to care for them.” Sources said the pachyderms were rescued from a circus a couple of decades ago. The court, acting on a petition filed by animal rights activists, had directed the forest department to take over the elephants. After the court order, the Mysore royal family volunteered to take care of the elephants and they were accordingly sent to the palace. The elephants were a tourist attraction at the palace and were used for “elephant safaris”, where tourists had an opportunity to ride them in the manner of royalty. Forest officials said that in 2017, the royal family wrote to the forest department to take back three elephants as the handlers were not taking proper care of the animals. However, the animals were not shifted due to administrative issues. Now they will finally move to Jamnagar. A team from Karnataka visited Jamnagar to check the facility there, after which it approved the transfer them to Jamnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-palace-elephants-to-come-to-gujarat/articleshow/86849492.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Patients and attendants visiting the hospital are forced to park their vehicles outside the premises, which is causing traffic jams and halting traffic movement for hours. “Vehicles parked haphazardly outside OGH have been a matter of concern for commuters, patients and attendants visiting the hospital on a daily basis,” Vinod, a shopkeeper in the area, told TOI. Drawing attention to the worsening traffic situation, the Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) sought immediate intervention from state officials and hospital authorities and provision of parking facilities for those visiting the hospital. “The general parking facility for the visiting patients and attendants has been removed. Prior to this, visitors were being allowed to park their vehicles in the premises of the old building and later the facility was moved to the new building, but now, even that is removed,’’ said Mohammed Ahmed, minority cell vice-president, GHMC, TTDP. Meanwhile, patients expressed concern over the rules imposed by the hospital authorities for the people visiting the hospital and demanded that authorities allow their vehicles inside the premises. “We are forced to park our vehicle outside and due to this motorists are being issued challans. Also, parking outside the premises is leading to traffic jams and obstructs ambulances. Thus, patients and attendants have to suffer a lot in the absence of a parking facility inside the hospital,” an attendant told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-parking-facility-at-ogh-chokes-road-irks-many/articleshow/86851442.cms||Omar bin Taher

Shetti started the tour by seeking blessings at Jyotiba temple in Kolhapur district. Now, he will visit all religious places located in all sugar cane growing districts. The Jagar Yatra will end on October 15 at Phaltan in Satara district. Currently, the FRP, which is fixed by the central government, is paid in one go. Shetti alleged that the central government is trying to impose “Gujarat model” of FRP payment for the cane farmers in Maharashtra. “Farmers won't be able to clear crop loans and buy seeds, fertilisers and chemicals if the payment is made in instalments,” he said. “We are against the payment of FRP in instalments. The Centre has proposed to do so and to our surprise, the state government has also agreed to the proposal and suggested to delay the third instalment till the arrival of next season which will make the farmers financially weak. I am going to visit all religious places and interact with the farmers. We have already started a missed call campaign and so far lakhs of farmers have supported it,” Shetti added. Meanwhile, Shetti’s demand is getting support from his rivals as well. Recently, Hatkanangale MP Dhairyasheel Mane, who defeated two time MP during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, said he will urge chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to withdraw the suggestion and write to the Centre against the breakdown of the FRP in three installments. “Farmers were consulted before the idea was proposed. I think the proposal has been taken to benefit few private mills,” Shetti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-kickstarts-jagar-yatra-against-breakdown-of-frp/articleshow/86845240.cms||---

The police cracked the case within 48 hours after the body of the boy, identified as Arav, was found outside his parent’s old house in Kapshi village of Shahuwadi taluka on Tuesday morning. Earlier, Rakesh Rangrao Kesare, Arav’s father, had registered the missing complaint about his son and had even taken part in the search operations carried out by police. The investigation was carried by eight teams with expertise in various crime domains — from cyber security to intelligence gathering — before Kesare admitted to the crime. Shailesh Balkawade, the district superintendent of police, who monitored the case, said: “Rakesh Kesare suspected his wife of having extramarital affairs. He doubted that Arav was not his biological son. Due to his suspicions, the couple often faught. recently, when Kesare’s wife was not at home, he strangled Arav and hid the body. It was a clear cold-blooded murder.” Kesare had also beaten up the boy before strangling him. He then hid the body in a pile of dry fodder kept in a shed in the backyard. The police said that Kesare bought ceremonial colours, a coconut, lemons and chillies and put up colours on Arav’s body. He spread the lemons and chillies around after taking the body out. “The accused wanted to make it look like there was a human sacrifice angle. He wanted to divert police attention from the real intention behind the murder. The suspicion of a human sacrifice had sparked tension in the village. We had to take utmost precautions,” said Balkawade. On Wednesday night, each family member was interrogated separately. After strict interrogation, Kesare admitted to the crime at midnight. On Thursday, after the arrest on a charge of murder (302 section of IPC), he was produced before the Kolhapur sessions court. The police were granted five-day custody of Kesare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-police-arrest-man-for-allegedly-killing-his-5-year-old-son/articleshow/86845218.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: 90-year-old Ambedkarite’s dream comes true, becomes village sarpanch for a week||KOLHAPUR: A 90-year-old man is living his dream. Since 1962, he has contested all local village elections for the sarpanch (village head) post of a historic village in Kolhapur. He never won. On Thursday, he was appointed the sarpanch for a week after the state government gave its permission. Bapu Pira Kamble, fondly called ‘Anna’ by the villagers, visited the Mangaon gram panchayat office, bringing along some work of an acquaintance. He is the senior-most resident of the village and has immense belief in democratic institutions and processes. After assuming charge as sarpanch, Kamble became emotional and said he was humbled by the decision. “It is the duty of every citizen to take part in the political process — directly or indirectly. I served people without any position and now as sarpanch I will ensure that poor villagers get justice,” he said. During his week-long tenure, Kamble can call meetings, discuss issues and give orders, but he cannot take financial decisions. Incumbent elected sarpanch of the village, Raju Magdum, said that they would often hear Kamble speak about his wish to be the sarpanch during his visits to the panchayat office. “We decided to make his wish come true. We wrote to Kolhapur Zilla Parishad officials for the permission. They gave us permission to make him sarpanch for a week, without hindering any executive function,” he said. The village has historical significance. It is where Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar made his first public appearance with legendary king Shahu Maharaj by his side. Magdum said that after Ambedkar passed away, the village decided to install his statue. “Kamble was one of the members of the committee formed to monitor the work of installation of the statue then. Now, he is only living member of that committee. A staunch Ambedkarite, he established a residential colony for poor people in the village,” said Magdum. Magdum said Kamble fought the poll against the panel through which he was elected but they did not let political differences come in their way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/90-year-old-ambedkarites-dream-comes-true-becomes-village-sarpanch-for-a-week/articleshow/86845287.cms||Abhijeet Patil

---||Chandigarh||Web of lies, deceit continue by UP govt, alleges SKM||Bathinda: After the Supreme Court order for details of arrests made so far in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, though the UP police stated to have arrested two persons and detained there, junior Union minister’s son Ashish Mishra remained untraced, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has pointed out. UP police’s three teams were trying to nab him but the fact that the police “allowed the prime accused to go missing” reflected the state of law and order in Uttar Pradesh, said SKM. More distressing video footage, including of the original recording of the mowing down of the unaware protesting farmers, had come into the public domain which clearly showed the killing intent of Ashish Mishra and his aides, it claimed. SKM said it was still waiting for action from the Uttar Pradesh government and the Narendra Modi government to show some semblance of morality by sacking Union minister of state Ajay Mishra “as with him continuing to be minister there was no hope for justice in farmers’ massacre”. The one-member judicial commission set up by the Uttar Pradesh government was not as per its demands and did not instil confidence in farmers of the country, the farm bodies’ organisation claimed. The UP government notification setting up the judicial commission of inquiry into Lakhimpur Kheri violence appeared to have been put out due to the SC hearing on the matter, apart from mounting public pressure, it said. The order did not mention anything about the key reason or objective of setting up such a commission, the inquiry should be on whether or not the incidents of Lakhimpur Kheri were pre-planned intentional murders, with the aim to intimidate and quell protests, it said. “In the notification there is no mention of the open threat issued by the Union Minister in a public meeting, about the role of the MoS and his son in the gruesome developments on Sunday and thereafter as there are reports of pressure being put on the journalist’s family to change their complaint and no FIR has been registered on this complaint so far. Further, the notification gives a time window of two months, which could be extended too. It is clear that this ordering of a judicial inquiry is to buy time and to postpone justice for the victims,” alleged SKM in a release on Thursday. SKM has also condemned the statement of Uttar Pradesh minister Baldev Singh Aulakh that Lakhimpur Kheri episode was an accident and demanded that he withdrew it. The apex court sought details of FIRs registered and arrests made and details about petitions pending before the UP high court in relation to the incident. Meanwhile, the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra has announced a state-wide bandh in Maharashtra on October 11 to condemn the incident. SKM also alleged that in Ambala on Thursday, an SUV carrying a BJP leader ran over a protesting farmer Bhavanpreet Singh. Farmers had gathered to protest with black flags against BJP MP Nayab Saini and Haryana minister Sandeep Singh who had come to Naraingarh in Ambala, when the MP’s vehicle speeded towards protesters and ran over Bhavanpreet, who was rushed to a hospital and treated for his injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/web-of-lies-deceit-continue-by-up-govt-alleges-skm/articleshow/86851472.cms||---

The arrival of 40 buses in two batches (19 plus one in first batch and 20 in second batch) will now be completed by December 30, according to the UT administrator’s advisory council’s sub committee on transport. The report will be placed before Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit on October 8. The report said, “In respect to electric buses, agreement has been made with Ashok Leyland for procurement of first lot of 40 electric buses on Gross Cost Contract (GCC) model under FAME-2 scheme”. The report further said, “The trial for electric bus has successfully been completed on city conditions……19 buses are proposed to be delivered by November 15 and balance 20 by December 30.” As per earlier arrangement, the city was to receive a fleet of 19 electric buses on September 30 and remaining 20 by October-end, but the manufacturer later had expressed its inability to supply the buses by the scheduled date. The first electric bus had hit the UT roads on August 11. After completion of a month-long trial run, the transport department had asked the manufacturer to make some technical changes in the bus. Three companies had submitted bids to run 40 electric buses. However, the lowest bidder, Ashok Leyland, was awarded the contract to run the environment-friendly buses for 10 years on the basis of km scheme. As per the agreement, all maintenance expenditure, bus charging stations, suspension, HVAC system and major and minor repair of the buses during the contract period would be the responsibility of the successful bidder. The department will pay Rs 60 per km to the company. The fare collection will be done by the authority. After being charged, the bus will cover a distance of nearly 200-300 km and it would take 2-3 hours to fully charge the bus. In September last year, the Centre had sanctioned 80 electric buses for the UT under Phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme. The procurement of the buses will give a major boost to the plan of the UT to replace its entire fleet of ordinary buses of the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) with electric buses. The transport department has planned to replace all the 358 diesel buses in the Tricity with electric buses by 2027-2028.

His friends, who were shocked, tried to get help. But since there was nobody around, they came to the foothills and sought help from the locals,” the police said. The police said the incident occurred at 10am and they received the information an hour later, after his friends reached the foothills and sought help from the local residents. The police team went to the spot and even a rescue team from Nashik city reached the location, after they were informed. They searched the area and found the body near Mukta Devi temple at 2pm.

---||Nagpur||Places of worship open, without any checks for vaccination status||Nagpur: Places of worship opened for the general public on Thursday, with little regard for Covid norms. The administration had opened up religious places with the condition that full vaccination is mandatory for entry of devotees as well as staff of the shrine. However, TOI’s visit to a prominent temple, mosque and church showed the vaccination norm was not followed in any of them. A TOI scribe later saw that Agyaram Devi temple was checking the vaccination status of all visitors. In some shrines, the only checks were guards holding thermal scanners or sanitiser sprays. Thursday was just a formal day for opening for many places of worship, which had already opened their gates, said locals. Despite the ban, visitors in small numbers could easily pay a visit and offer prayers, said those in the vicinity like flower vendors. TOI reached Mominpura at the time of asar (fourth prayer). “How can we ask people if they have been vaccinated. They come here again and again, it’s practically not possible for us to comply,” said a committee member of a mosque. People slowly started reaching the mosque after the prayer call. “There is not much enthusiasm, as not many know that the mosques have been opened. The numbers are still much lesser than pre-Covid times,” said Sajid Anwar, secretary of Jame-e-Masjid Committee. As TOI moved around elsewhere, people said they have been coming for prayers even earlier. The management members said they were among the limited persons allowed so far. After being closed following first wave of Covid, religious places opened in November last year, only to be shut till now after a brief period. At the Tekdi Ganesh temple, devotees lined up with newly purchased cars to seek blessings for the vehicle. Some had got their registration numbers but had been waiting for the temple to open up, while there were also cars just out of the showroom. Even here, there was no insistence on vaccination. This TOI scribe waited at the entrance and also went inside till the sanctum without being asked for his vaccination status. A temple staffer said they were asking for digital copy of vaccination certificate at the entrance, but TOI could fine no one doing that. Nandkishore Pattewar had come with his one-month-old grand-daughter to seek blessings. “It’s a custom to take the child to a temple a month after birth. We just took a chance and came here, to find the temple open. We did not know that the government had allowed opening of temples,” said the child’s mother. The SFS Church held the first mass after over a year. The benches soon had occupants. TOI also waited on watching people enter. There was no one to check the vaccination certificates. “There was someone to check the certificates earlier, who has joined the worship. Now, we will be closing the door without allowing others during the mass,” said an official from the parish office. Fr Anthony D’souza said, “We have already announced that norms like sanitisation, distancing and double vaccination have to be followed by all worshippers. All these rules will be followed at all times.” A little ahead, the Lady of Lourdes shrine at Seminary Hills was also open. A visitor said it was open even earlier, but congregations were not allowed. Some other temples close by were also reported to have been open since some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/places-of-worship-open-without-any-checks-for-vaccination-status/articleshow/86849568.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Mumbai||Booster for health staff unfair to those waiting for first shot: BMC commissioner||MUMBAI: BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said it would be unethical and even unjust to give healthcare workers a third dose when many haven’t got their first and second doses of Covid vaccine till now. The discussion on whether healthcare workers should be given a third shot gained momentum recently after 31 MBBS students from KEM Hospital tested positive for Covid despite the majority of them being fully vaccinated. The civic authorities had to field calls from the Centre inquiring about the mass infection. Chahal told TOI that officials from the Centre wanted to know what was causing the infections and whether they were vaccinated. “Of the 31 infected, only one student was unvaccinated and that too because he was less than 18 years old. This has nothing to do with the potency of the vaccine or the fact that they didn’t receive a booster shot,” said the commissioner. He said that most students were asymptomatic and were hospitalised only for observation. “It shows vaccines are effective,” Chahal added. Two students from second year MBBS at GS Seth medical college attached to KEM were symptomatic and tested positive on September 27. The contacts of these students were tested. Dean of KEM Hospital Dr Hemant Deshmukh said that nearly 900 students have been tested, of which 31 came positive.

This comes as great relief for both students seeking admission and the college management. Students who could not clear the OCET-CET PG entrance exam held for the 2021-22 session will also get a chance to take admission. With this, all colleges will be able to enroll in courses like MSc (including Chemistry, Physics, Biology), MCom (BE), MCom (Entrepreneur and Family Business) ME and MTech at their own level. Several PU affiliated colleges in Chandigarh and Punjab had raised the issue of vacant seats to be filled under CET at the postgraduate level with the PU administration. The colleges had sought permission to fill all vacant seats at their level. In this case, a high-power committee was constituted on behalf of the PU vice-chancellor, on whose recommendation, PU administration has approved admission to MSc, M.Com (BE) and MTech courses with certain conditions. PG (Science) seats are vacant in many colleges of Chandigarh, as well as in some colleges, including Abohar, Dasua and Ludhiana in Punjab. PU has given permission to the college administration to conduct admission to postgraduate science and engineering courses, but colleges will have to follow prescribed rules for admission. First of all, waiting students will get admission in the merit list of OCET or CET-PG conducted by PU. In the second phase, students who appeared for CET entrance but did not pass will get a chance. In the third and final stage, new students will be admitted only if there is no candidate in the CET merit list. For engineering (MTech) course, GATE score and PU CET (PG) entrance score will be preferred. Admission in MTech course will also be available in Sector-26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-allows-colleges-to-conduct-admissions-on-vacant-seats/articleshow/86849563.cms||---

We want exemplary punishment for the BJP leaders for this gruesome attack.” Congress leader and Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, who accompanied Sidhu said, “We want to stand by farmers when their loved ones have been brutally killed. There is no politics behind this as even our leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi too have met the families.” SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “All those responsible for this massacre should be put behind bars immediately, however high they may be”. Badal said the delegation will also meet Uttar Pradesh government representatives and impress upon them to arrest the perpetrators of this ghastly act immediately.

---||Mumbai||With 1 crore doses in hand, Maharashtra kicks off 7-day mission to jab 15 lakh+ daily||MUMBAI: With over 3 crore people in the state yet to receive the first dose of Covid vaccine, the state government is launching a week-long special vaccination drive — Mission Kavach Kundal — from October 8-14. The aim is to vaccinate over 15 lakh people every day and give priority to those who have not even received their first dose. So far, the state has managed to vaccinate over 15 lakh people in a day only once. The mission’s fuelled by the fact that the state has nearly one crore vaccine doses at its disposal. Health minister Rajesh Tope said of the total 9.2 crore population eligible to be vaccinated, 2.6 crore are fully vaccinated after receiving both doses and 6.2 crore have got the first one. “Nearly 65% of the population has received at least one dose. We want to intensify the drive to ensure that at least 75%-80% population is covered to reduce the severity of the third wave,” said Tope. Statistics put out by the Union ministry of health showed that the 2.57 crore people the state has fully vaccinated is the maximum in the country. But it is only 28% of the eligible population in the state. Maharashtra also ranks second in the total number of vaccine doses given in the country as of Wednesday. Tope held a detailed meeting with health officials and has asked that staff from other departments and even private players be roped in to achieve the target of Mission Kavach Kundal. According to the data on district-wise vaccinations, there are at least 22 districts which have a lower percentage of vaccination than the state average. Tope said the pace of vaccination has been good and so they have thrown open almost every establishment, including religious places from Thursday. “Given the scale of our vaccination, even if someone does get infected in the future, the severity will be less, and there will be no panic demand for ICU beds or oxygen. The fatalities, too, will be controlled as a result,” said Tope. Tope, who acknowledged hesitancy among some sections, said the state will be taking the help of religious and community leaders to bring people to the vaccination centres. Senior officials said there is resistance in the rural areas as the second wave has ebbed and there is the fear of side-effects. Manpower crunch is the other challenge, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-1-cr-doses-in-hand-state-kicks-off-7-day-mission-to-jab-15l-daily/articleshow/86851584.cms||Bhavika Jain

The sunshine state contributes about 92% of India’s charter business as it receives 2-2.5 lakh charter tourists annually. Over the past year, the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) had lobbied hard with various authorities for special permission for chartered flights to land in Goa. It had even submitted a memorandum to Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy during his visit to the state two weeks ago, requesting that charter flights be allowed to restart. TTAG president Nilesh Shah said he was jubilant to hear about the Centre’s announcement. “Opening of the charter market will help all tourism stakeholders; big and small. Even now, over 2,100 small hotels are yet to open,” he told TOI and added that the association is awaiting clarity on the process that will be followed to issue five lakh free visas, and the declaration of standard operating procedures (SOP) for international travellers. While the first charter to Goa generally lands by the third week of October, chief operating officer at Sita Travels, Ernest Dias, said the first one of the current tourism season could possibly arrive in the first week of November from Russia. “There are a lot of preparations to be made. We need to get (plane) parking slots, so we are looking at the first week of November for charter arrivals. Though it will be a month late, it is better than having nothing,” Dias said. Charter tourism in Goa began in the 1970s, with the advent of the flower children. While their arrival spurred charters from the UK, Finland, Poland Germany and Norway, the influx of the Russians began from the 1990s. Up until the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a majority of the charter tourists who had landed in Goa were from Russian destinations. Besides, the state also receives charters from Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The MHA has declared that non-charter foreign tourists will be able to travel to India from November 15. All Covid protocols notified by the Union ministry of health and family welfare have to be followed by foreign tourists and the carriers that will bring them into India. Goa receives a total of 8-9 lakh foreign tourists each year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/green-light-for-charters-gives-hope-for-goas-tourism-sector/articleshow/86853593.cms||---

Shahu Maharaj passed away on May 6, 1922, at the Panhala Lodge palace. Several attempts were made to erect the memorial at the said place. However, the land was sold to a trust that has now built a high-rise building at the same spot. On Wednesday, historians, led by Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil, met state tourism minister Aditya Thackeray, who immediately agreed to setting up of the memorial. Historian Indrajit Sawant, who had accompanied Patil to meet Thackeray, said, “Shahu Maharaj is considered a ‘Rashtra Purush’ and it is a policy of the government to set up a memorial for them. The Panhala Lodge building does not exist anymore, but we expect a memorial pillar to be erected at that place. Shahu Maharaj breathed his last there and his last rites were performed in Mumbai in the presence of hundreds of thousands of people.” Sawant said the duration between May 6, 2020, and May 6, 2021, is being celebrated as the death centenary of Shahu Maharaj and the memorial pillar would be a tribute to him, if built this year. The historians also reminded Thackeray about his promise of building a Kolhapur Bhavan that will provide shelter to youths moving from Kolhapur to Mumbai for jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/memorial-pillar-for-shahu-maharaj-to-come-up-in-mumbai/articleshow/86845394.cms||---

While most other universities in the state are ready with the syllabus, MU is yet to finalise the same. Several professors and lecturers have criticised the delay in finalising the syllabus, as the academic year is set to begin on October 10. A senior undergraduate college professor expressed concern as only a few days are left for the academic year to begin. “Since the content and guidelines are already available, the syllabus can be finalised in one day. We are not aware of the reason for the delay. Last-minute preparations will cause inconvenience to students and teachers,” said a lecturer from a government first grade college. Mangalore University vice-chancellor PS Yadapadithaya told TOI that the syllabus is being finalised. “The syllabus is awaiting final nod from competent authorities including the Board of Studies. It is likely to be finalized in a week,” he said. The VC is also the chairman of the faculty of commerce and management committee to implement NEP -2020 in the state. Yadapadithaya maintained that the university has accepted the syllabus formed by the state committee and a few changes will be made. “The syllabus for second, third and fourth year of graduation will be finalised later. In case of delay in finalising the syllabus for first year students, we may delay reopening of the colleges for first year students by a week,” he said. Mangalore University will hold a day-long workshop for all teaching faculty and student representatives to familiarize them with the syllabus and NEP-2020. NEP’s four-year graduation programme has multiple exit options. A candidate on completion of two semesters earns a certificate, on four semesters a diploma, a degree on completion of six semesters and honours for completing four years or eight semesters. The current UG programme has six semesters and is completed in three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mangalore-university-yet-to-frame-syllabus-under-nep/articleshow/86850264.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Delhi Disaster Management Authority has banned public celebrations of Chhath Puja this year too due to Covid-19 situation. Tiwari has been demanding that Chhath Puja celebrations in public places should be allowed because Covid-19 is largely under control in the capital. “The Kejriwal government has allowed the opening of swimming pools where people are enjoying for hours together every day. When so many people using swimming pools for hours can’t spread Covid then how can Chhath Puja celebrations for which devotees get into knee-deep water only for some time on two days spread Covid.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Teenager throttles woman to death during sexual assault||NAGPUR: A 19-year-old man, Amlesh Kumar Mondal, allegedly throttled a 25-year-old married woman to death after trying to sexually assault her, near cement pipe factory on Sawargaon Road at Dongargaon, in Nagpur rural on Tuesday. Police found that just before the assault and murder, Mondal was watching porn sites on his cellphone, which has been seized and sent for forensic examination now. The victim, who had nail marks on her throat, also bore tell tale signs of violent sexual assault, including bite marks on her lips. The forensic team of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital have collected her vaginal swab for chemical analysis. Mondal was sleeping in his room near the cement factory when cops from Katol police station of Nagpur rural picked him up. The perpetrator was nabbed on the basis of CCTV footage from the factory premises, which showed him entering the victim’s hutment and later also scuffling and dragging her back inside when she tried to escape. Police said the victim, a native of Madhya Pradesh, had come to Sawargaon a few days back to meet her parents, who worked at the cement pipe factory, and stayed in the nearby hutment like other co-workers. The woman usually stays with her husband in Nagpur. It’s learnt Mondal, a native of Bihar, had come to the cement pipe factory site some days ago to seek work. He was staying with some acquaintance who works at the cement pipe factory. Sources in the police said Mondal sneaked into the hutment of the victim, who was sleeping beside her three-year-old daughter. He tried to put his arms around the victim after lying beside her. When she resisted, he tried to force himself upon her. Mondal is learnt to have initially asked the woman not to raise an alarm and also tried to gag her. The stunned woman tried to flee from his clutches and raise an alarm, which appears to have prompted Mondal to silence her throttling her. Police said the entire episode went on for around 20 minutes. SP Vijaykumar Magar said the CCTV footage revealed the victim had tried to flee, but the perpetrator had dragged her back into the hutment. “We have already slapped charges of violation of modesty, as there is direct evidence that force was used wrongly to take the victim inside her hutment. Forensic experts will confirm if there was rape,” he said. “The CCTV footage suggests he at least tried to rape, and it could be one of the possible intentions behind the crime. But there could be some angle of economic gain too, like fast cash or mobile too,” he said. A senior cop said Mondal’s mobile phone’s browsing history showed he avidly watched porn sites. Just before the crime, prima face he was watching porn. “We have seized the cellphone with due procedure and shall now send it to cyber forensic experts for their opinion,” said senior inspector Mahadev Acharekar of Katol police station of Nagpur rural, where offences of murder and molestation were registered.

Thereafter, the estate office wrote to the UT finance department to grant permission for e-auction of these sites and to clarify terms and conditions. According to Chandigarh administration records, these nursing home sites are situated at prime locations of the southern sectors of Chandigarh. Since these sectors lack the facility of nursing homes, the nine nursing home sites will provide major benefit to area residents. Out of these six sites, two each are in sectors 33-C, 46 and 51. These sites have been lying vacant for over a decade. As per records, UT earmarked 16 nursing sites across the city way back, out of which only seven were auctioned and remaining nine could not be auctioned till date. The UT has given permission to auction six sites. Sites vacant for yearsAlthough dedicated nursing sites are still vacant after many years, Chandigarh administration recently issued a draft order for the nursing home policy, enabling conversion of residential sites into nursing homes.

They also locked the main entrance of the grain market and raised slogans against the government, demanding fixed MSP for their produce. After a high voltage drama for an hour, the administration managed to convince the protesting farmer to lift the blockade. However, the commuters had to face difficulties during the blockade. Protesting farmers alleged that rice millers along with government officials were looting the farmers on pretext of moisture and deducting Rs 150-200 per quintal in the fixed MSP Rs 1,960 per quintal. Jagtar Singh, a protesting farmer, alleged, “On the one hand the government claims to procure the farmers produce on MSP, on the other rice millers along with government officials are deducting Rs 150-200 per quintal despite having permissible limit moisture (17%). They are procuring our produce on MSP only on paper.” Meanwhile, rice millers also held a protest in Karnal grain market over slow lifting. Vinod Goyal, president of Karnal rice millers association said, “In the interest of the farmers, we have purchased the paddy up to 22% against the permissible limit of 17% moisture content. But due to the slow lifting, the produce has started to damage. The produce has been loaded in vehicles, but they are not being allowed to shift it to the rice mill because the online system is not issuing gate passes. The government should issue manual gate passes until the process functions smoothly or we will not cooperate the procurement process”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-protest-over-alleged-deduction-in-msp/articleshow/86851612.cms||---
---||Delhi||Forensic scan for all stolen smart devices||New Delhi: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has directed the force to subject all smart digital devices recovered during the investigation of property offence cases to cyber forensic checks. According to police, smart digital devices include mobile phones, laptops and desktops in cases involving snatching, robbery, theft and burglary. “Examination of digital data captured by various devices such as smartphones and laptops after the commission of an offence can provide significant and vital leads to the investigating officers (IOs) about the co-accused and the receivers involved in the disposal of such devices,” the order stated. According to the police chief, the information can be helpful in identifying and dismantling the network of specialised handlers who work in an organised manner to dispose of these devices. They should be subjected to cyber forensic examinations at district cyber cells or through relevant tools available remotely at National Cyber Forensics Laboratory under Cyber Prevention Awareness Detection of Delhi Police. An officer said the cyber forensics might retrieve the data of call logs, messages, including those of social media applications, media files that were added or modified after the offence, browsing history, location data and network logs. “In important cases, a mirror image of the device should also be preserved for reference,” an officer said. According to another officer, even if a snatcher or robber has deleted all data of a stolen item, “with the help of forensics, it can be retrieved”. This can help investigators know with whom the accused was in contact after the offence and trace the receiver of stolen properties, he added. Different kinds of software, called “tools”, are used for opening locks of devices while some are used to retrieve data and hidden files, the officer said. Earlier, police used to scan seized devices. It has been noticed that cases of phone and gold chain snatching are increasing and the force is taking steps to curb them, an office said. In July, Crime Branch of Delhi Police, in a letter to senior officers, had sought data to prepare a fresh compendium of receivers of stolen items. These criminals usually sell these items to their known receivers after committing the crime and the receivers further channel these articles to their known interstate linkages, it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forensic-scan-for-all-stolen-smart-devices/articleshow/86851649.cms||Abhay Singh

The plea alleged that Kappan is losing his eyesight due to diabetes and that he is in pain and requires hospitalisation. Kappan, a Delhi-based journalist from Kerala, was arrested by Mathura police on October 5, 2020, while on his way to report on the gangrape and murder of a Dalit woman in UP’s Hathras district. He was charged with sedition and under the UAPA. The plea filed by Kappan’s lawyer, Wills Mathews, said that despite SC’s direction to officials on April 28 that Kappan be discharged only after his recovery, they got him discharged when he was still Covid positive. “He was shifted to the Mathura jail in clear violation of SC’s direction. He had high sugar levels of around 460 mg/dL (normal is less than 140 mg/dL) along with serious dental problems and medical issues,” Mathews told TOI. The plea alleged that he was discharged at a time when he needed treatment after a fall in the bathroom. Some of his teeth are displaced and there is serious pain in his veins and nerves, it said. Wife meets CM: Meanwhile, Kappan’s wife Raihanat has sought CM’s intervention for her husband’s release. She was speaking to the media after meeting the CM and opposition leader V D Satheesan in the assembly on Thursday. She said that Kappan is a journalist who always took pride about his state and secular credentials. But he is now languishing in prison after being branded as a terrorist, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kappan-files-contempt-plea-in-apex-court/articleshow/86849650.cms||---

Fatalities too dropped for both on Thursday. Maharashtra reported 49 deaths, down from 90 on Wednesday, while the city saw five deaths on Thursday, pushing the death toll to 16,141. On Wednesday, it had reported nine fatalities. Mumbai’s cumulative cases have now risen to 7.5 lakh. Jumbo centres, which are admitting the majority of the Covid patients now, have seen an uptick in admissions over the last few days. At Goregaon’s Nesco jumbo facility, for instance, admissions have jumped from 2-3 in a day to 8-10. Dean Dr Neelam Andrade said the number of hospitalised patients used to be around 20-25 till a week ago. “It has doubled now. We had a few walk-in admissions too. The patients had come with depleting oxygen levels,” she said. The dean added that the centre may be seeing more patients as the western suburbs are still reporting cases. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of the BKC Covid hospital, said the rise is not exponential as of now. “We are recording around 3-5 admissions and have only one patient in the critical care facility,” he said, adding that people must get tested as soon as they get symptoms. A senior official said with cases continuing to decline, the state government is likely to take a review of the situation and loosen some of the restrictions in has for running establishments. Owners of hotels and restaurants have been demanding extension of the deadline to keep their establishments open. Currently they are allowed to stay open till 10pm. “A review is likely this week and a decision may be taken to give further relaxations,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-wednesday-spike-cases-fall-but-admissions-rising-in-goregaon-jumbo/articleshow/86851648.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy lists out pro-women initiatives in Ongole address||ONGOLE: Asserting that he is ready to walk many extra miles for the empowerment of women, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday said the state government will take all measures for their sustainable development.  The CM, who released the second tranche of financial assistance to women self-help groups under YSR Asara at a public meeting at PVR high school grounds in Ongole, said his government set a record by reserving over 60% of all elected and nominated posts for women. “We are only lessening the debt owed to you for your love and affection,” Jagan said, amidst applause and slogan shouting. He said Asara celebrations will be held in all districts except Kadapa from October 7 to 18, taking each mandal as a single unit. The scheme will be implemented in Kadapa district from November 6 to 15 after the Badvel by-election.  “This government has already spent Rs 12,759 crore towards YSR Asara in the last 28 months. The previous government betrayed SHG women by not keeping its promise of waiving off loans. Several lakhs of self-help groups slipped into debt trap as they could not clear the loans just because they believed N Chandrababu Naidu’s words,” said Jagan, adding that the loans piled up due to the accumulated interest took the original dues of Rs 14,204 crore to Rs 25,517 crore. Nearly 20% of self-help groups were notified as non-performing assets (NPA), while many groups performing well and in A grade were downgraded to C and D due to non-payment of loans, he said. “In addition to his failure to clear the debts, Naidu also ditched the women by stopping the zero interest loan scheme from October 2016. I saw your ordeals during my padayatra and decided to clear the dues in four spells,” said Jagan, further stating that the government has not only started implementation of Asara but has also renewed zero interest loan schemes benefiting nearly one crore women. The chief minister said just around 0.73% of SHGs are notified as NPAs now and those with C and D grades have bounced back to A position, registering a recovery rate of 99.5%. “Around one crore women of 9.41 lakh SHGs benefited through zero interest loans as the government credited Rs 2,362 crore. About 44.50 lakh women and 85 lakh children have received Rs 13,023 crore through Amma Vodi. About 61 lakh people are receiving pensions in the state, which only 39 lakh during the TDP rule,” the CM said. He also sanctioned Rs 400 crore for a drinking water project in Ongole and announced that water will be drawn from the first tunnel of Veligonda project by August 2022 and the second tunnel will be ready by February 2023. The women beneficiaries of self-help groups showered praises on the chief minister “for keeping every promise” made before the general elections and said they wanted him to continue as chief minister for “several generations to come”.  “The CM is implementing welfare schemes irrespective of caste and creed,” said Swathi, from Pakala village in Singarayakonda mandal of Prakasam district. She said she got Rs 24,000 through Asara scheme in the last two years at a time when her family was struggling to make both ends meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-lists-out-pro-women-initiatives-in-ongole-address/articleshow/86851645.cms||Samdani MN

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: From darkness to light as temples reopen||MUMBAI: Thursday’s reopening of religious places led devotees from six months of darkness to light. Worshipers and temple trusts were overjoyed to pray together. Footfalls were slow to pick up but the Navratra weekend could draw larger numbers. MVA leaders visited religious places. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his son, cabinet minister Aaditya and wife Rashmi visited Mumbadevi temple. Mayor Kishori Pednekar, governor B S Koshyari, the deputy mayor, politicians Ram Kadam, Rahul Narvekar and Bhai Jagtap arrived too. Cabinet minister Aslam Shaikh and Nawab Malik visited Haji Ali and Mahim dargahs. Ministers Rajesh Tope and Chhagan Bhujbal visited Mahalaxmi Mandir. Thackeray said they prayed to the guardian deity Mumbadevi to end the pandemic. He appealed to devotees and temple trusts to follow rules and conduct disciplined ‘darshan’, and appreciated the initiative of religious trusts to regulate crowds by using technology. Prayer mats in mosques filled up fast as numbers were limited by social distancing. Shuaib Khatib, chairman of Juma Masjid Trust, shared videos of Zuhr (afternoon) namaz, where alternate places on mats were kept vacant. Fr Venancio Mascarenhas, parish priest of St Joseph’s Church, CBD Belapur, allowed two worshipers per bench. Emotions welled over at Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Orlem, as parishioners streamed in. Parish priest Fr Michael Pinto said, “Some were in tears as we opened the church at 6am. We rang the church bells, welcomed people and all were happy to worship the Lord.” Fr John Lobo, parish priest of St Anne’s, Mazgaon, said parishioners are now accustomed to masks. But footfalls at temples remained low on day one. Milind Dalvi, chairman of Shiv Ganesh temple trust in Lokhandwala Complex, Andheri, said, “Wednesday was the last day of Shraadh period, which is Sarv Pitru Amavasya. That is when most people head to temples to offer ‘dakshina’ to the priest as they pray for souls of ancestors. That day we had such a large turnout at Lokhandwala, that it was a sight to see. Footfalls are always low on the following day, which is the start of Navratra. They will gather pace from the fifth day till the ninth day,” Dalvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-darkness-to-light-as-temples-reopen/articleshow/86851742.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Kochi||Attack against girls defeats very concept of gender justice: Guv||Kozhikode: Referring to the recurring incidents of attacks against girls in state, governor Arif Mohammed Khan said that such cruel behaviour defeats the very concept of gender justice. Delivering the convocation address at Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) at Pookode in Wayanad on Thursday, Khan called for a healthier, interpersonal relations on campuses. "I say this in the context of unfortunate attacks on girls due to lack of gender sensitivity. Such cruel behaviour defeats the very concept of gender justice and reminds us of mental slums about which president S Radhakrishnan had warned us long ago," he said, adding that Radhakrishnan had said that it is through educational institutions that the spirit of democracy, compassion and empathy must be developed. Khan said that time has come for men to change their attitude and realize that it is in their own interest and that of the society at large to accept women as their equal. "It is when we ensure the best practices in gender justice that the spirit of democracy and compassion blossoms in our campuses," he added. A 22-year-old student was murdered by her boyfriend at St Thomas College in Pala last Friday allegedly following a strained relationship. Also, in another incident a 24-year-old BDS student was shot dead by her former lover at Kothamangalam in July. Khan reminded that like many civilizations, India had also started with the worship of women and pointed out that in classic prayers like Gita Govinda composed by Jayadeva, one can read verses which idolized women. "We idolize women but we stop there. The trouble is we do not follow it. As in so many other instances, we pass resolutions and we stop there. I should say in fairness to our governments, both central and state, and our private philanthropic and religious institutions that they have brought about a renaissance in women’s education," he said. The governor said that it was heartening to see the impressive women (65%) representation at KVASU. Khan said that KVASU, being the only university located in Wayanad (the only aspirational district identified in Kerala for focused development), the varsity has the additional responsibility of empowering vulnerable sections including tribesmen. Animal husbandry department minister J Chinchurani was the chief guest. VC MR Saseendranath, MLA T Siddique, Vazhur Soman, registrar P Sudheer Babu among others attended the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/attack-against-girls-defeats-very-concept-of-gender-justice-guv/articleshow/86849796.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nesco cites loss, asks for some jumbo hospital space||MUMBAI: Owners of Nesco Ltd in Goregaon have requested the state government and BMC to vacate some of their premises that house the 3,500-bed jumbo Covid hospital. The private entity has cited mounting financial losses, saying it is unable to use the space to host big-ticket exhibitions and is losing events to other cities. Spread over six lakh square feet, Nesco’s Bombay Exhibition Centre was converted into a jumbo Covid hospital in June last year. The BMC has been using five of the six halls in the exhibition centre for the treatment of Covid patients. In the first phase, 2015 beds were started in halls B and C and D, which included a 206-bed ICU and a 30-bed dialysis centre. In Phase-II, another 1,496 beds were added this year in hall E in preparation for the third wave. Hall A has been used for vaccination since February. In addition, Nesco’s banquet hall called Grande, built over 19,000 square feet, served as the control room, office and storage space for medical equipment and drugs. Dean Dr Neelam Andrade said they have started the process of shifting out the control room, administrative office and central stores so that the Grande hall can be returned to Nesco by this weekend. Operations that were conducted out of Grande will be shifted to Hall A. The dean, though, said a decision about vacating or scaling down use of the exhibition centre will be taken by higher authorities. As on Thursday, 118 beds out of 3,511 were occupied in Nesco Covid centre, including 28 in the ICU. She said halls A,B, D, E are operational and C is on standby while hall F was never used by BMC. Situated along Western Express Highway, Bombay Exhibition Centre used to be a permanent venue for conventions, exhibitions and trade fairs. When Covid struck last year, an isolation centre complete with ICUs was proposed to cater to the western suburbs. The facility has till now admitted 24,512 patients and carried out over 2.8 lakh vaccinations. Due to Nesco’s unavailability, Mumbai has been losing out on all major exhibitions to Hyderabad, Delhi and Bangalore, said Dipesh Singhania, CFO, Nesco. “The flagship jewellery exhibition was the latest to be held in Bangalore two weeks ago. We are not asking for the entire premises but whatever is not in use. There is only a fraction of beds currently occupied in the six lakh square feet exhibition halls,” he said. In pre-pandemic 2019-20, the exhibition centres earned a revenue of Rs 165 crore. While Nesco earns rental income from the BMC, he said it didn’t cover their losses. Nesco administrators are believed to have approached Subhash Desai, minister for industries, to resolve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nesco-cites-loss-asks-for-some-jumbo-hosp-space/articleshow/86851779.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The MLC posts representing one each from Vizianagaram, Chittoor, Prakasam, East Godavari and Anantapur districts, two each from Visakhapatnam, Krishna and Guntur districts fell vacant and are to be filled now. With the ruling YSR Congress winning all these ZPs and the municipalities, the party’s victory in these MLC posts is for sure. Similarly, the three vacant MLC posts from the assembly quota too are to be filled.

Hence, requesting you to provide vaccination status of society members, maids, security guards, milkman, laundry person and gardener.” On Monday, BMC launched a logo having a QR code pasted on it. This logo will be given to societies having all adults fully vaccinated. The certificates will be pasted outside housing societies. Medical health officer (R North ward) Dr Avinash Vayadande said special Zoom meetings with housing societies have been held. “We have informed them about nearest testing centres, if required, and the need to get everyone vaccinated.

The Haryana gangsters would insert skimmers in the automated teller machines to steal passwords and other card details on the pretext of helping the elderly and tech-disabled to withdraw money.The cyber fraudsters were caught during routine checking of vehicles on Faizabad-Lucknow national highway under Raunahi police limits. Talking to TOI, Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey, said, “When police tried to intercept an Ertiga car, the driver accelerated and tried to flee. Police gave chase and stopped the vehicle to find three occupants, who were later identified as Praveen Kumar and Sandeep from Hisar and Mukesh Kumar from Jind. Four cloned ATM cards and 200gm of smack was recovered and the car number plate too was fake. During interrogation, the trio spilled the beans .” Police said, the accused would hover around ATM outlets and target uneducated people and elderly, who would queue up to withdraw money. On the pretext of helping them, conmen would insert skimmers and copy card details. “Then they would use the cloned debit cards to empty accounts. Since masking up is common during pandemic, these men would not get identified from CCTV footage, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/atm-cloning-gang-busted-old-unread-were-targets/articleshow/86853689.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Supreme Court grants interim bail to Rana Kapoor’s wife, daughters||MUMBAI: In a relief to the wife and two daughters of Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, the Supreme Court granted them interim bail on Thursday, a week after the Bombay high court rejected their plea for liberty.His wife Bindu Kapoor and daughters Radha Kapoor Khanna and Roshini Kapoor are accused in an alleged case of fraud and corruption of over Rs 600 crore registered last year by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A bench of Justices S K Kaul and M M Sundresh heard the trio’s senior counsel Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Aabad Ponda, who said they were sought to be charged under Section 409 of Indian Penal Code for (criminal breach of trust by a public servant or banker) which carries a life sentence. The three were on interim bail after being summoned on filing of a chargesheet and despite the fact that a supplementary chargesheet filed this year added lesser offences attracting up to seven years’ imprisonment (Section 468 for forgery for cheating), bail was denied, both by the trial court and the Bombay high court, they submitted. The CBI, represented by additional solicitor general S V Raju, sought time to file a counter-affidavit. The Supreme Court granted him four weeks and any rejoinder in two weeks thereafter. The Supreme Court, in its order, said it appears that the bail was sought to be denied even though the petitioners were granted bail earlier with a more serious offence. The SC listed the matter after six weeks and granted interim bail with no specific conditions as they were originally granted bail. The three had argued before the high court that the trial court had gravely erred in observing that the accusations against them prima facie show complicity with the other co-accused in having fraudulently and dishonestly received loans of over Rs 600 crore “as quid pro quo for favour shown by Yes Bank Ltd to DHFL”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-grants-bail-to-rana-kapoors-wife-daughters/articleshow/86853694.cms||Swati Deshpande

As part of the final leg of the RoB construction, the work for re-grading and concreting of approach roads at both Bondel and Vamanjoor sides of the project is scheduled to be taken up between October 10 and November 10. To facilitate the work, the level crossing (No. 6A) at Pachanady will remain closed for road traffic from October 10. The vehicles will be diverted to alternative routes. Accordingly, light four-wheelers can take the alternative route via PWD Bund Road originating from Pachanady. Heavy vehicles like buses and trucks may ply through Kulshekhara to reach Vamanjoor from Bondel. The new RoB will ensure hassle-free access from Bondel and Vamanjoor. The 27.95m long and 12m wide RoB is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 5 crore utilising funds from the track-doubling project. The old RoB was only 9.25m long and 6m wide.

---||Kochi||Seized contraband not MDMA but Meth: CB||Kochi: The excise crime branch team probing into the drug seizure at an apartment in Kakkanad said that the seized contraband was not MDMA but Methamphetamine, a strong narcotic drug popular among party-drug users. The contraband, weighed over 1kg, was sent for a chemical analysis test at regional chemical examiner’s laboratory at Kakkanad, and the results said that it was Methamphetamine also known as Meth, ice or speed in the market. It is similar to 3,4 MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, but has a different chemical structure. “Both MDMA and Meth are popular synthetic drugs among party-drug users for its stimulant and hallucinogenic properties. The contraband sold in Kerala as MDMA are usually Meth. As Meth is also a strong narcotic drug, its possession in large quantities is a crime that attracts almost the same stringent penal measures as MDMA. Meth is used widely among youngsters,” said an officer associated with the probe. Moreover, the investigation team suspects that the drug was smuggled in from Europe and the operations were handled from Sri Lanka. The drug was smuggled into Chennai via international smugglers and the accused persons in the case purchased it from a local dealer in Triplicane, Chennai. More details are being collected by the investigation team to confirm the source. “Though we found that the accused bought the drugs from Triplicane it was suspected to be made in a foreign country and smuggled into Chennai. There was no information about the drug being locally manufactured in Chennai. But the investigation based on some photographs received from the accused and a few labels found on the drug packets suggest that it was manufactured in a European country. We are yet to confirm it and a probe in underway,” said sources. Meanwhile, the crime branch produced Susmita Sujith (40), who is the 12th accused in the case, before the principal sessions court, Ernakulam, on expiry of her custody period on Thursday. She was remanded by the court into judicial custody. She was arrested on September 30 for her alleged close links with the key accused in the case. The crime branch team has so far arrested 12 persons in connection with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/seized-contraband-not-mdma-but-meth-cb/articleshow/86849847.cms||---

Vikash Kumar Dhano, the defence estate officer of Lucknow Cantonment Board, said, “The construction of the plant began in July and was completed by September. This is the second plant in cantonment. We have one oxygen plant to serve a small 20-bed hospital.” “A total of 555 oxygen plants were approved in UP and 392 are operational, reflecting the speed with which the state and central governments have moved to meet the Covid-19 challenge,” said deputy CM Sharma. He added, “Around 1,200 oxygen plants will be inaugurated today across the nation, giving a boost to our health infrastructure.” A 3,000 litre-per-minute oxygen generation plant was inaugurated at King George’s Medical University with the support of PM CARES fund.

The contractor, Bitcon India Infrastructure Developers Pvt Ltd, had been awarded a Rs 17-crore contract in 2020 to maintain service roads from Ghodbunder to Nitin company junction. Over the last few months, a few stretches were dug up to replace utility lines, but these patches were never repaired properly. “This is a rare instance of a contractor being penalised for shoddy work.

The pension was transferred to her as she was an unmarried/unemployed daughter of the freedom fighter.In 2015, the ministry had sent a letter to the district collector to verify the marital and employment status of Joice. The collector had sent a reply stating that Joice was married, due to which the pension was cancelled. She had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2015 and the court in 2018 had remanded the matter back to the authorities for fresh consideration.Pursuant to the court’s order, the ministry had sent a letter to Joice seeking to submit certain documents along with details about her marital status though the state government. Meanwhile, the collector had submitted a report stating that she was married and was deserted by her husband. Instead of submitting the required documents through the state government, she once again filed a petition before the HC and the single bench had directed to restore the pension to Joice from 2015 along with arrears within eight weeks.As per the scheme, married/widowed/divorced daughters of freedom fighters are not eligible to avail the dependent pension. The single bench’s order to award dependent pension to the married daughter of a freedom fighter is not in consonance with the scheme and would set a wrong precedent, the appeal said.A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar granted interim stay on the order of the single bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-stays-order-on-pension-to-freedom-fighters-daughter/articleshow/86851895.cms||---

Jadavpur University closed the vaccination camp one day before the deadline due to fewer students turning up. The JU authorities had submitted the total requirement of more than 3000, but, around 700 students reported for the first and second dose at the campus.

A free vaccination camp was held at Surendranath College campus for the students of Surendranath group of colleges from September 30 till Thursday. The principal, Indranil Kar said, “The whole process went on smoothly and both the doses were administered. The second dose has some date issues.

When TOI had highlighted this issue on September 23, officers of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) had assured to look into the matter. However, another TOI reality check on Thursday, found the situation more or less similar. Several patients and their family members, who are recuperating at home, said that while the health department conducted anti-larvae spray at their houses a day after being diagnosed with dengue, LMC has not conducted any fogging. Also, in a few cases, anti-larvae sprinkle was also not performed. Manasnagar-resident Shyam Prakash, who was diagnosed with dengue on October 1, said that even after six days neither the health department, nor LMC officials conducted any mosquito control exercise. Husainganj-resident Kaushal Kishore Pandey, whose 15-year-old daughter Ruchi Pandey was diagnosed with dengue on October 5, said around seven persons in his locality have been diagnosed with the disease. “The entire area is reeling under mosquito menace, but only anti-larvae spray has been done. ,” he added. Municipal health officer Dr SK Rawat agreed that there was some disturbance in fogging activities for five-six days. “All zonal officers will have to submit reports every day and it will be ensured that there is no delay now.” Mosquito population control is the only way to check vector borne diseases like dengue and malaria. LMC must carry out fogging on priority basis, at least in the hotspot areas. Any laxity may lead to spread of the disease in the entire city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dengue-sting-fails-to-spur-lmc-into-action-cases-soar/articleshow/86853705.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Over 50 villagers donated blood on occasion. Rakshasa, owned by Siddalingesh Wali at Kerimattihalli village in the district, after having won several awards and prizes in bull-taming events, has become famous in the region. Its fans organised the camp in association with the Central Blood Bank of Haveri District Hospital at Grama Devate Temple in the village. Wali and his bull’s fans also brought a 5kg cake, cut it and distributed its slices among the villagers before the blood donation drive was launched.

---||Mumbai||‘NCB’s custody plea has vague grounds’: Bail hearing today||MUMBAI: Observing that police custody cannot be granted on “vague grounds”, the Esplanade court on Thursday rejected a plea by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for continuing its custody of Aryan Khan (23), son of filmstar Shah Rukh Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant (26), and six others. The court remanded them in judicial custody on Thursday. The order is significant as it means that the bail applications filed by the two and the others can and will be heard. The court said since jail authorities would not accept an accused after 7pm without Covid reports, their judicial custody be under custody of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. The court further said it would hear bail pleas on Friday after additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for NCB, said he would argue against their maintainability and file a proper written reply. Khan’s counsel Satish Maneshinde made a bid for interim bail too After a lengthy hearing in the drugs seizure case, additional chief metropolitan magistrate R M Nerlikar said in his order at around 7 pm, “No doubt it is the duty of NCB to investigate, but simply remanding accused to police custody would be violating fundamental right of accused under the Constitution.” The court committed the matter to sessions court. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede had led a team of NCB officers for a raid last Saturday at the International Terminal at Mumbai Port Trust, from where a cruise liner was to depart for Goa. The team intercepted Khan and others, found no drugs on Khan, but claim to have found 6 grams of charas on Merchant and 5 grams on co-accused Munmun Dhamecha’s cabin floor, along with several other recoveries from others. Merchant’s counsel Taraq Sayed said neither his client nor Khan had any connections with the other accused. The NCB sought further custody of Khan and the others, saying the case was one of “criminal conspiracy” and Aachit Kumar, a fresh accused, was arrested on Wednesday based on Khan’s statement. Also, a foreign national had been “intercepted” and the 8 accused needed to be confronted with Kumar as the aim is to probe further to crack down on supply chain and end the gang, NCB said. Kumar, 22, was picked up on October 5 and “illegally detained” by the NCB officers “over-zealously” before they showed his arrest on Wednesday, said his counsel Ashwin Thool. The NCB counsel, Advait Sethna, seeking his remand, said it had recovered 2.6 grams of ganja from Kumar’s house and “he is considered to be the supplier to Khan and is part of the ganja trafficking network.” So a confrontation is needed to “identify all associates,” he said, stressing the court must take judicial note of “what is happening.” The court order for Kumar said NCB has made out a case for his custody for investigation and granted police custody till October 9. Maneshinde said Khan had no complaints against NCB during his custody but argued that NCB had had enough time to confront the accused since October 5. Since the last remand, no interrogation of Khan was done, neither was anything recovered, he said. The NCB cannot rely on confrontation alone now for further custody, he said. Advocate Ayaz Khan for two co-accused, Nupur Satija and Ishmit Singh, added there was no recovery of ganja from the eight accused, so how could Kumar be the “supplier”? Hence, why should all accused be confronted with Kumar, said Ayaz Khan, and the court agreed. Besides, he said, most accused were found with ‘small quantities’, with punishment ranging for a day’s imprisonment to a year or just a fine. Ayaz Khan also said the ship had a few thousand rooms and was like a floating hotel. There may be a sundown party but in their own rooms, nothing collective, he said. He and Sayed stressed the court has to see each case individually and the NCB remand was “misleading the court” as it sought to show seizure of cocaine and other drugs collectively. Advocate Ali Kaashif Khan for Dhamecha, as well as Lakshmi Raman for Mohak Jaiswal, advocate Kushal Mor for Gomit Chopra and Ashish Raghuvanshi for Vikrant Chhokar argued they too have no connection with the other accused, and with NCB already having had their presence for so long, there was no case for further custody. The court said it cannot discuss at this stage what took the probe team so long to arrest the accused with whom they need to be confronted. The court said that as pointed out by defence lawyers and SC rulings, each day of police custody has to be explained, but it is not reflected in the remand plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-simply-remanding-would-be-violating-fundamental-right/articleshow/86851963.cms||Swati Deshpande

Four western countries had filed applications with the Chennai office for GI tag for 12 products. Unlike preceding years when the GI registry would publish the list of newly certified products one by one, this year, it has chosen to publish all 51 on its website in one go. And the presence of at least a dozen products from four western countries points to a new trend. Registration of some of these products are pending since 2018, and now, instead of issuing the certificates to the applicants concerned, the GI top brass has been calling on chief ministers of the respective states and handing them over the certificates ‘personally’. With this list, 421 products ranging from handicraft to agriculture have been given GI tag in India. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka share the top position with 43 GI products each. P Sanjai Gandhi, GI attorney and designated nodal officer for Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation, has obtained GI tags for 25 products so far. In the latest list, out of five, four applications were filed by Sanjai Gandhi. Tamil Nadu has filed at least a dozen more applications for products like Salem mango, Madurai marikozhundu, Myladi (Kanyakumari) statue and Manapparai murukku. They are all pending. In the latest list, nine products, including Banaras hand block print, Mirzapur Pital Bartan and Manu Saree are from Uttar Pradesh. The hill-state of Uttarakhand has six products, including Kumaon Chyura Oil, Ringal craft and Thulma, to its credit. Tamil Nadu has earned GI tag for five products — Kanyakumari clove, Thanjavur Netti works, Karuppur Kalamkari paintings and wood carvings of Arumbavur and Kallakurichi. Kerala’s Kuttiattoor Mango and Edayur chilli are in the list along with Tamenglong orange and Hathei chilli of Manipur. Himachal Pradesh has got GI tag for Lahauli Knitted Socks and Gloves and Chamba chappal. Telia Rumal of Telangana, Sojar Mehndi of Rajasthan, Manjusha Art of Bihar, Sohrai-Khovar painting of Jharkhand, Mizo Ginger of Mizoram, Dalle Khursani of Sikkim, Naga Cucumber of Nagaland, Harmal Chilli of Goa, Judima and Joha Rice of Assam and Pithora of Gujarat are also new entrants to the GI club. Obtaining GI recognition is a complex process. Once applied, a ‘formality check’ report is issued within a month, after due verification of the claim. In case of any defect, it is returned giving the applicant time up to a month to rectify it and resubmit. The second stage concerns the all-important ‘consultative meeting’, where a seven-member body headed by the GI registrar calls upon the applicant or the attorney concerned to make a power-point presentation of issues like historical origin, uniqueness, method of production, specification, description and area of production. If satisfied, the committee forwards the application to the journal for publication. If no public protest is received within a maximum of four months of publication, the product is accorded GI status. If could be rejected in case of objections. The committee can keep it pending and seek further clarifications within a time frame.

As garba had not been held for almost two years due to the Covid pandemic, Amdavadis were determined to organise Navratri this time around, even if it was allowed only in the form of sheri garba. “Navratri is one festival that people of Gujarat enjoy to the fullest, and prepare for months ahead of the festival. Rain or no rain, people have high expectations from the society garba and look forward to making the most of it,” said Ankur Aggarwal, chairman of Orchid Harmony near Shantipura Circle. Had it been a commercial venue, organisers would have been struggling to keep large-scale venues, club lawns and ground dry, ensuring there is no damage to the equipment and sound system and so on. However, this year, since events are on a relatively smaller scale and limited to residential colonies, people are well-prepared. Kalpesh Shah, resident of a society in Vejalpur, said, “It’s the first Navratri in two years and even though it rained, no resident called to complain about anything. The plan is on as usual. We do not usually put the sound system out well in advance, so there is no damage. People are all prepared to start off with the aarti and then enjoy playing garba. Last year, when it rained, people enjoyed garba in the parking area instead of lawns.” In fact, in societies wherever there is no lawn and only a concrete ground, rains came as a boon in disguise as the floor was washed clean with the spell of moderate rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rain-fails-to-dampen-navratri-spirit/articleshow/86850163.cms||---

Water was released on June 4, and the first crop was cultivated on the 45,000 acres in the double crop area from Peranai in Dindigul district to Kallandiri in Madurai. Though it is a 120-day crop, as the nurseries were started early, many farmers had started harvesting the paddy from September 20. If the procurement centres were not opened in time, the farmers would lose about Rs 15,000 per acre, because most of them were selling a 65-kg bag for Rs 800 to traders, whereas the government through the centres would give Rs 800 for 40kg.Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said in a statement that mobile procurement centres would be opened through the cooperative societies, if the farmers were ready to provide 1,000 bags weighing 40kg each.But Thirupathi said that it will not be an easy task. Issues between departments have to be sorted out in time to save our paddy,” he said. In places such as Rangarajapuram in Madurai, paddy crops have started getting submerged in water and farmers are hoping that procurement centres are opened fast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/open-dpcs-to-procure-harvested-paddy-avoid-inundation-farmers/articleshow/86851966.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Durga Puja organizers in Kolkata get rain-ready||KOLKATA: The rain forecast from Ashtami has prompted Puja organisers to take fresh guard. From arranging for pumps, using wooden planks and sand on the ground to covering open spaces with water-resistant sheets —organizers are racing against time to be rain-ready even as diligent pandal-hoppers troop out to “finish their quota early” in case the Puja days are washed out. The weather department has predicted a wet Durga Puja in the city as a low-pressure system over north Andaman Sea may develop into a cyclonic storm on October 14. TimesViewThe weather forecast adds another worry to the list for both organisers and government agencies, particularly cops. unseasonal rains may reduce the number of pandal visitors but may also lead to overcrowding at places and during the dry spells. Everyone should guard against this but, ultimately, the most critical aspect will be the behaviour of visitors to pandals.Some organizers, like Young Men’s Sporting Association on Keshab Chandra Sen Street, whose half-finished pandals went under knee-deep water after showers last month, have written to the KMC, asking for extra pumps. Swapan Mahapatra, treasurer of Ekdalia Evergreen Club helmed by minister Subrata Mukherjee, said, “We will have two pumps to drain out the water and pandal will be covered with tarpauline sheets.” Some organizers have started laying planks if the ground gets sludgy. “We have kept wooden planks and sand ready to stop the ground from getting wet. We have covered the open space this time,” said Sandipan Bandhopadhyay, one of the chief organizers at Behala Natun Dal. Kidderpore’s 74 Pally is also using planks. Notun Dal is using wooden planks and sand;Many organizers are using water-resistant materials. Tarun Dal in Dum Dum Park is one such club. “Most materials being used are water resistant,” said Biswajit Prasad, Tarun Dal secretary. Some, like Thakurpukur SB Park Sarbajanin, are scaling down decorations, as was pointed out by club secretary Sanjay Majumdar. Ashok Dey of Mudiali Club said they would build a shed for visitors to take shelter if it poured. “We would have liked to cover all sides of the shed, but the Covid situation forced us to keep it open,” said Dey. Abhishek Bhattacharya, secretary of Tala Barowari, said, “If we cover the outside, that space might be counted as part of the main pandal. To allow people to see the idol from afar, we can’t put up a cover,” said Bhattacharya.Police have kept 13 pilot cars and 28 trauma-care ambulances and doctors at 14 medical camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-organizers-get-rain-ready/articleshow/86852014.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Bhushan was speaking at an online lecture on ‘Democracy and struggles for justice’ organised by social organisation Sanjhi Duniya. He was joined by activist Teesta Setalvad as speaker. “We are seeing a dismal picture of democracy today where its three pillars -- executive, judiciary and the media -- are not performing their duties. The judiciary, media and election commission which ought to be independent of the government are not behaving so and we have many examples before us be it the recent Lakhimpur Kheri case, the Delhi riots or the Bhima Koregaon case among several others,” said Bhushan. “What we need today is a massive civil society movement whose vision document for the country can also be helpful to the opposition which is devoid of a clear current narrative. Civil society and citizens play a crucial role in restoring democracy,” added Bhushan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/civil-society-movement-a-must-for-justice-bhushan/articleshow/86853764.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

People who have unauthorised shops, petty shops and those who continue to have shops after their licences have expired will be dealt with sternly if they do not voluntarily remove the encroachments, corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan has said.The crackdown comes in the wake of heavy congestion in many parts of the city, mostly due to encroachments on pavements and even on the road at traffic junctions and shopping areas which see a large floating population. Suguna Store junction at Anna Nagar is one such place which sees heavy congestion with vendors sitting near vehicles parked beyond the pavements. ``At many places these pavements are damaged, so the encroachers and the vehicles give pedestrians a difficult time especially during the night,’’ said T Kathiravan, a resident of Anna Nagar.All bus stops in Madurai like Pudur and Avaniapuram have many vendors encroaching the pavements and the roads. Roads in the vicinity of Government Rajaji Hospital witness rampant encroachments on weekdays throwing traffic out of gear, obstructing even ambulances coming to the hospital sometimes. “These encroachments have to be removed permanently. Removing them after a short notice and then ignoring it make it convenient for them to continue encroaching the important places,’’ said R Ganeshan of K Pudur.With Diwali shopping under way, removal of encroachments is very important, said sources at Madurai corporation.Entire Chinnakadai street | Avaniapuram bus stand to Semboorani | East Marret street | Government Rajaji Hospital | Suguna Store - Anna Nagar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/corpn-gives-encroachers-a-week-to-quit/articleshow/86851983.cms||---

The former Telangana health minister had joined BJP only in June after he was removed from the state cabinet over allegations of land-grabbing and growing differences with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Many are seeing this as an indication of the growing importance of Telangana for the BJP ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. It is also a indication that the party is taking the Huzurabad by-poll on October 30 very seriously. Besides Eatala, six other Telangana leaders have been added to the national executive. By comparison, three leaders from Andhra Pradesh made it to the list. Actress-turned politician Vijayashanti is the other special invitee from Telangana. Union minister G Kishan Reddy, and state executive members G Vivek, G Mohan Rao, and Jitender Reddy have been named as regular members of the national executive. D K Aruna, the current national vice president and another prominent leader, has been appointed to the body as an office-bearer. Sources said the party has given priority to leaders who have joined them from other parties. Eatala, DK Aruna, G Mohan Rao, G Vivek, and Vijayashanti have all joined BJP in the last one year. “While this may cause some internal strife between newcomers and old-timers, it is necessary to expand the party,” a top leader remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-6-others-from-t-in-bjp-national-exec/articleshow/86851999.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Festive demand revs up September car sales by 44%||AHMEDABAD: Backed by a good demand during the Janmashtami-Ganesh Chaturthi festive season, car sales showed a 44% growth in September this year. This is the highest volume of car sales in nine months. According to the latest Vehicle Retail Report released by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), 24,992 cars were sold in September, up from some 17,306 cars sold in the same month in 2020. While dealers are rejoicing a surge in demand, they’re concerned over shrinking inventory due to the semiconductor shortage, as the festive season approaches. According to information provided by FADA, dealers barely have inventory that will last over the next 10 days. Pranav Shah, chairman of FADA (Gujarat region) said, “Car sales have shot up significantly backed by the demand during Janmashtami as well as Ganesh Chaturthi. Usually, sales are not as upbeat during these muhurats but both pent-up demand coupled with the delayed deliveries due to semiconductor shortage have caused sales during these muhurats to remain good.” “The increasing preference for a personal vehicle since the pandemic has continuously fuelled the demand. That apart, people did not make expenditures such as foreign travel and luxury purchases and therefore, those who could afford did invest in a vehicle,” Shah added. Besides cars, even two-wheeler sales picked up significantly in September, touching 71,828 units against 44,400 sold in September last year, up 62%. “The demand was good but rise in automobile prices after the BS-VI rollout is significantly impacting two-wheeler sales in general. In the upcoming festive season, we’re expecting good sales in two-wheelers especially,” said Malav Shah, director of a city-based two-wheeler dealership. Dealers also said that the partial reopening of colleges has also propelled sale of two-wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/festive-demand-revs-up-september-car-sales-by-44/articleshow/86850147.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Woman files body-shaming plaint against app-biker||Kolkata: A woman lodged a complaint at the airport police station, alleging body shaming by the rider of a bike taxi she had hired. She claimed the rider asked her to hold him tight or she might fall off due to her weight. At the end of the ride, he reportedly charged her extra—more than what showed on the app bill—saying he had to strive to keep balance as she was overweight. Cops at the airport police station lodged a case of alleged body shaming under IPC 509, which deals with intentions of insulting the modesty of a woman. According to the complaint, the woman booked the bike around 9.20pm on October 2 from Sinthee in north Kolkata to a high-rise at Kaikhali. “As the ride ended, the fare came to Rs 63 but the rider insisted I pay him Rs 70. He could have said it was late at night and so he wanted the extra fare. But what he did say was I was ‘too heavy’ and ran his eyes on me. During the trip, he had even asked me to hold him but I had refused. When I said I would not pay him extra, he did not stop and tried to intimidate me by saying he did not like arguments,” the victim wrote. When TOI contacted her, she said she was yet to hear from police. “But since I have lodged my complaint, I do not wish to comment,” she stated. The woman claimed she tried to take up the matter with the bike app company around 10.50pm that night but the customer care executive not only refused to give either details of the rider, saying it went against their privacy policy, but there was also no response from the company to her complaint on their Twitter account. “I request you to kindly contact the bike taxi company and get the details so that I can file an FIR for making ‘sexually coloured remarks’,” the woman appealed in her official complaint. This is not the first police complaint against bike taxis this month. Another passenger had uploaded a similar complaint of overcharging on the Kolkata Police Twitter handle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-files-body-shaming-plaint-against-app-biker/articleshow/86852075.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ardhanariswar gets a permanent home after 3 years||KOLKATA: The ‘Ardhanariswar’ (half male-half female deity) Durgotsav now has a permanent venue and the city’s trans people opened it with much fanfare on Thursday, with Australian consulate general Rowan Ainsworth as the chief guest. For the last three years, the Puja has been performed in a 9ftX9ft room, within the confines of the apartment belonging to Ranjita Sinha, secretary of transgender support group Gokhale Road Bandhan and Association of Transgender/Hijra Bengal. From this year, it’s being organized at Garima Greh — the permanent shelter home funded by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment. Since August this year, the two-storey building at Mukundapur has been serving as a home for trans people, many of whom were driven away in the pandemic. The Centre tied up with Gokhale Road Bandhan to run this space for 25 homeless people of the community. “It’s only appropriate that we bring our Durga home to this permanent shelter that has been carved out for trans men and women. For, our God is special — an ‘ardhanarishwar’, moulded by trans-persons themselves,” said Sinha. On Thursday evening, celebrities and senior police officials assembled at the launch of the city’s specially inclusive Durga Puja to celebrate LGBTQI and others marginalized in society. Cutting the ribbon, Ainsworth said: “I am always with you, supporting your cause.” Later speaking to TOI, Sinha said: “We have appealed to the state government to provide us with the grant CM Mamata Banerjee has announced for organizers reeling under the Covid crisis. Considering that ours is a small-budget yet unique Puja, we hope the government will not disappoint us. Even the rites will be performed by a transgender priest.” Sinha said utmost care was being taken to follow Covid protocols and only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to participate. “Last year, Covid was raging and we just had a token event with barely four to five persons because we didn’t want to break the continuity. This year, thankfully the court has allowed 15 persons to assemble at a time.” Starting Thursday, they will also observe the Navratri festival, which coincides with Durga Puja. The Puja symbolizes a gamut of metaphors questioning the practice of the class structure that has traditionally barred transgenders and other minorities from taking part in socio-religious events. “Everyone is welcome — from gay, lesbian, bisexual to the heterosexual and not just the gender variants. In pandemic times, the count mustn’t exceed limits,” said Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ardhanariswar-gets-a-permanent-home-after-3-yrs/articleshow/86850065.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

They have claimed that the procedure laid down under the NCB manual was followed. Our contention is that there was serious violation of set procedures in the NCB handbook while arresting the accused. It clearly indicates that the NCB wants to push the matter under the carpet,” Sawant said. Aryan Khan, Arbaz Merchant and the twists and turns of the NCB raidSawant demanded stern action be taken against erring NCB officers as per provisions of Section 59 of NDPS At. “It is the responsibility of NCB to ensure safety and custody of the accused. In the present case, custody of the accused was given to outsiders. At least that is what appears from the video which has gone viral. Violation of Section 59 attracts rigorous imprisonment for not less than 10 years, which may be extended to 20 ,” he added. Sawant said as per the NCB handbook, the drug law enforcement officer is responsible for the safety of those arrested and he must keep the arrested always in sight. “In this case, security of the arrested was compromised when a private individual was taking a selfie with him.” Sawant said while Manish Bhanushali claimed he was an informer, NCB said he is an independent witness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-cong-alleges-ncb-violated-rules-gave-custody-of-accused-to-outsiders/articleshow/86852035.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Coimbatore||Rape case: Coimbatore police move court to regain custody of IAF officer Amitesh Harmukh||COIMBATORE: A week after the September 30 order of a mahila court that handed over the rape case and custody of the accused, flight lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh, 29, to the Indian Air Force, the Coimbatore city police on Thursday filed a revision petition to regain his custody. Amitesh Harmukh was arrested by the Coimbatore police on September 25 after a colleague accused him of raping her. On September 30, the additional mahila court judge (in-charge) Thilageswari acceded to the IAF plea for custody of Harmukh so that he could face court martial proceedings. The FIR filed by the Coimbatore police quoted the woman officer as saying she was subjected to the two-finger test by IAF authorities. This has been denied by the IAF chief. On Thursday, inspector E Nirmala, representing the local all-woman police station, filed a revision petition before the principal district judge R Sakthivel to revoke the mahila court’s order of handing over custody to the IAF. Noting that the rape case is under investigation by the all-woman police and that the accused should be in judicial custody until the chargesheet is filed, the Coimbatore police said the court could decide on handing over the case to the IAF to conduct a court martial only after that. “Only Coimbatore city police or other investigation agency can investigate the rape case. Armed forces cannot investigate the case and the IAF did not appoint any official to conduct the court martial. As per Section 124 of the Air Force Act, 1950 (choice between criminal court and court martial), only when the case is ready for trial, can it be transferred to IAF for court martial. As of now, the city police have not completed the investigation. So, the mahila court’s order should be revoked, and the flight lieutenant should be restored to judicial custody,” said a senior police officer. The petition is likely to come up for hearing after the puja holidays. Amitesh Harmukh from Durg in Chhattisgarh was arrested on charges of raping a woman colleague at the Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) near Red Fields in Coimbatore city on September 10. He was remanded in judicial custody and was lodged at the Udumalpet sub-jail on early September 26 morning.

---||Delhi||Numbers low, but farm fire hotspots same as last 5 years||NEW DELHI: While the number of farm fires so far this year may be lower in Punjab and Haryana compared with last year, the usual hotspots appear to be the same. Over 50% of crop stubble burning incidents in Punjab between September 1 and October 6 were centered in Amritsar and Tarn Taran, while Kurukshetra, Karnal and Ambala districts in Haryana recorded the major chunk of “red dots” captured on Nasa’s satellite imagery. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist at Universities Space Research Association, Nasa, who analysed VIIRS satellite data between September 1 and October 6, said clear hotspots had emerged during this period, with Amritsar showing a high fire count. “Fires detected by VIIRS SNPP satellite data and Fire Information for Resource Management System showed hotspots in both Punjab and Haryana. Overall, the fire count is only expected to increase in the coming days as the monsoon begins to withdraw,” added Gupta. LS Kurinji, programme associate at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said data had shown over 340 farm fires so far in Punjab, while 68 were recorded in Haryana. However, the hotspots hadn’t changed much compared with data of the last five years. “So far, fires have mostly been spotted in Amritsar and Tarn Taran in Punjab and Kurukshetra, Karnal and Ambala in Haryana, similar to the trend observed in corresponding periods over the past five years. Taking cues from historical data, the Punjab government should focus on efficient logistics management of existing crop residue management options in these hotspots to ensure timely access to farmers,” said Kurinji. Amit Banka, founder and CEO of WeNaturalists, an environment-centric social network, said stubble burning was not a recent phenomenon, with states now knowing fully well what the problem was. However, timely solutions were still not being provided to farmers. “It’s now time to focus on the solutions. In countries like the UK and China, it has been banned and alternatives adopted. There are multiple options available, including promoting low lignocellulosic crops, using manure and decomposition techniques or simply using new machines and technologies,” added Banka. Last year, Punjab recorded its highest fire count since 2016, while Haryana showed a significant improvement, recording numbers lower than the last five years. Stubble burning tends to pick up in both states as well as Uttar Pradesh from the second week of October when harvesting season begins. Unable to remove the stubble on time before planting the next crop, farmers often resort to burning the residue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/numbers-low-but-farm-fire-hotspots-same-as-last-5-yrs/articleshow/86850100.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

While the state government, which has rolled out a biofuel policy and attracted investments in the sector, is looking at the new opportunity to popularise the use of the home-made green fuel, petrol and diesel dealers who are losing some business, are complaining about the its retailing policy. Recently, the Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association had written to chief secretary Niranjan Arya that the Centre’s biofuel policy did not allow retailing of the biofuel by the producers. It is only through oil marketing companies of the government that retailing can be done. Surendra Singh Rathore, CEO of Biofuel Authority of Rajasthan, said there are clear guidelines for retailing of biofuel. “The Centre’s guidelines allow private retailing of biofuels and the state policy has adhered to all the guidelines while allowing retailing,” said Rathore. Rajasthan was the first state to roll out the biofuel policy and has attracted investments of about Rs 125 crore with 11 plants already operating. Cumulatively, the 11 plants have the capacity to produce 4.20 lakh litres a day, but the current production is 2 lakh litres a month against the diesel sales of 4.50 lakh litre per day. In fact, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had applauded the biofuel policy of Rajasthan and said, “The state government has constituted the Biofuel Authority under the ministry of panchayat raj and rural development. The government of Maharashtra too can take a decision on the same lines and give permission for the sale of bio diesel in the state.” The petroleum industry body had also raised the issue of base oil being sold in the garb of biodiesel. Base oil and biofuel cost around Rs 70 per litre much less than the price of normal diesel which have risen over Rs 100 recently. A senior official in the Biofuel Authority of Rajasthan said the allegations of base oil being sold under the garb of biofuel is wrong. “In fact, the government should check how much of these spurious base oil is mixed with diesel that we buy from fuel stations. It’s a scam by the petroleum lobby,” he said. Base oil is the waste derivate of the diesel and other oils and used in industrial applications. But after the spike in fuel prices, illegal sale of base oil as a motor fuel has increased significantly. It is not only damages parts of vehicles, but also highly polluting. The official said the government should fix the end-user users of the base oil so that it can be checked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/diesel-price-hike-brings-spotlight-on-biofuel-base-oil/articleshow/86852066.cms||---

Tagging a video, purportedly showing two SUVs ploughing through protesting farmers, Varun tweeted: “The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for spilling farmers’ blood.” The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the in… https://t.co/b8Ij5Vzk04— Varun Gandhi (@varungandhi80) 1633577113000And within hours of his outburst, Varun and his mother, Menaka Gandhi, an MP from Sultanpur, were dropped from the 80-member BJP national executive announced on Thursday. Earlier, Menaka was not repeated as a Union minister after BJP’s thumping victory in 2019 Lok Sabha elections and then not accommodated in the recent reshuffle in the Modi cabinet as well. “The party brass is strong enough to take hard decisions, irrespective of the stature of a party functionary,” said a senior BJP leader. Gandhi’s hardened stand came amid an unrelenting Opposition’s attempts to corner BJP over the gruesome incident, in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed. And, a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and sister Priyanka met the family of deceased farmers, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav too headed to Lakhimpur Kheri. On October 4, a day after the horror unfolded in Kheri, Varun, an MP from Pilibhit, dashed off a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe into the incident, which he said, was “unforgivable in any decent civilisation”. He also sought swift identification and arrest of accused. Varun could not be reached for comment. His staff said, the MP is unwilling to speak to the media at this point of time. His statements, nevertheless, have caused discomfort to BJP. A senior party leader told TOI that Varun’s belligerent tweets were a sign of brewing anguish against the party, which would be taken up by the high command. “His (Varun’s) parliamentary seat has farmers and this could be the reason for his repeated outbursts. The party has a disciplinary committee at the Centre, which would consider his statements and act accordingly,” said UP BJP spokesperson Hero Bajpai. Last month, Varun became one of the few BJP leaders to come out in support of farmers, who gathered at Muzaffarnagar on September 5 to protest against farm laws. Experts said Varun’s recent observation vis-a-vis farmers attained political significance even as UP heads to elections next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/belligerent-varun-again-tweets-against-incident/articleshow/86853791.cms||Pankaj Shah

The pipeline frm Nasirabad storage tank connects to Adarsh Nagar, where the incident took place. The rupture was so powerful residents could hear the sound from a distance and there was water everywhere. The pipeline was buried under the road, but after the rupture, a 20-feet ditch was created, and traffic remained halted for many hours. The supply to the city was stopped from the Nasirabad pumping station and gallons of water was wasted. There was a 4-feet waterlogging in the Adarsh Nagar main road and the police reached the spot to control the situation. A Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) official said engineers had reached the spot and started repairing the pipeline. According to officials, the 20-year-old pipeline was made of cement and was buried underground. It probably could not bear the pressure created due to the plying of heavy vehicles, they said. Ajmer was already reeling under water scarcity with supply in every two days as the water level in Bisalpur dam went down to 311 meters. However, after monsoon it had crossed 312 meters.

---||Kolkata||Mamata, the central Puja theme in her own backyard||Kolkata: At least five Durga Puja organizers in the Bhowanipore have incorporated chief minister Mamata Banerjee in their theme. While one of them is showcasing Banerjee’s humanitarian character and her commitment towards people of Bengal, others are focussing on Banerjee’s successful schemes. In its 73rd year, Bhowanipur Swadhin Sangha on Mahesh Chowdhury Lane in Bhowanipore has based this year’s theme on Mamata Banerjee’s poem ‘Gorje Otho’ (‘Roar’). Banerjee penned the piece after the attack on students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on January 5, 2020, protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “Through our theme, we want to project Didi as a national leader at the 2024 Parliamentary elections,” explained Sanjib Ghosh, who along with fellow club member Uma Dey selected the theme. The pandal will depict the recent farmers’ movement through straw installations. The central theme will be portrayed through a 25ft-tall fibreglass sculpture. Bhowanipur Durgotsab Samity on Bakul Bagan Road has decided to give its pandal a ‘Khela Hobe’ touch. “In the pandal. I will try to create the experience of an open-air stadium with a gallery, football nets and goal posts. The Durga idol will be flanked by players from Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. A golden artwork resembling Olympic gold medallist Neeraj Chopra with his javelin will welcome the Goddess,” said fashion designer turned theme-maker Soumen Ghosh. Hundreds of footballs, cricket bats and balls, and badminton racquets will be used to decorate the pandal. “Though the slogan ‘Khela Hobe’ is political, there will be nothing political in our Puja theme. Instead, we are using the spirit of this slogan for popularising sports,” said Bhowanipore Durgotsab Samity general secretary Subhankar Roy Choudhury. Chakraberia Sarbojanin Durgotsab’s central theme ‘Aparajita’ will be projected through installations and eco-friendly items. The art will showcase the struggle of a woman since the time of Draupadi in Mahabharat. And this will indirectly project Mamata Banerjee’s political career, showcasing her rise from a lower middle class Bengali family to the office of the chief minister. “Due to the restriction imposed for the Assembly bypoll, we decided to keep the theme a closely guarded secret and it will be unveiled soon. After a record setting victory in the bypoll, we are keeping some elements of surprise in the manner Didi’s journey is presented,” said club president Ashim Kumar Bose. Bhowanipore 75 Pally at Debendra Ghosh Road in ward 71 plans to spend more than half the budgets to support Chhau artists of Charida village in Purulia district where many artist families have been reduced to penury by the pandemic. “Our CM was the inspiration behind the theme selection. We have named the theme ‘Manabik’,” said club convenor Moloy Dey. Rupchand Mukherjee Lane Sarbojonin Durgotsab, will showcase Banerjee’s successful schemes like Lakshmir Bhandar, Rupasree, Kanyasree, Swasthya Sathi, Sikshashree and Khadyashree through lightings from Chandernagore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-the-central-puja-theme-in-her-own-backyard/articleshow/86850095.cms||---

It is a unique experience for the children to listen to their voices on radio, as they are not as exposed to the medium unlike those in urban areas. However, this time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we could not take the students to the radio station and they were disappointed,” said L Chokkalingam, headmaster, Chairman Manickavasagam Middle School. Considering the pandemic, the All India Radio station officials reached out and allowed the students to record their voices from their homes and send it to be compiled and processed at the station.The students from classes I to VIII recorded a special programme with the support of their teachers. “The students performed songs, poems, speeches, stories etc. Teachers went to each of the students’ home and helped them record it on WhatsApp audio call. We sent some voice samples first and it was approved by AIR. After that, we had to carefully record the content in a manner it was clear,” said Chokkalingam. The children recorded content for two special programmes of 30 minutes each.P L Ammusri, a Class VIII student, who performed a song on trees, said that though she was disappointed that she could not visit the radio station in Madurai, teachers made up for it by coming to their homes to record the audio. “I’ve been doing this for two years and I was so happy to hear my voice on radio for the first time. My parents are also happy and proud. We are looking forward for the programme to be broadcasted,” said S Mercy, another Class VIII student who recited a poem penned by her.The content by the school students will be broadcast on AIR Madurai on October 21 and 28 around 9pm at night. “Apart from telling a story, I was really happy to compere for all the programmes.

---||Delhi||IIT-Kharagpur undergrad held for stalking teachers, girls||NEW DELHI: A 19-year-old studying metallurgy and materials engineering at IIT, Kharagpur, has been arrested for allegedly stalking schoolgirls and teachers and circulating their morphed pictures on social media. Police said that Patna resident Mahavir even hacking into online classes and joining school WhatsApp groups to access contacts and pictures of minor girls. Police first learnt of Mahavir when they received a complaint about online stalking of girl students and teachers from a north Delhi school on August 8. “The complainant alleged the stalker was sending the girls lewd WhatsApp messages and making obscene calls to teachers on international phone numbers and from the numbers of students and teachers too,” said Sagar Singh Kalsi, DCP (North). “The school also accused the man of entering online classes and joining WhatsApp groups without the approval of the admin. Several pictures of students, morphed to look nude and semi-nude, were also circulated on social media platforms.” Based on the complaint, a case was registered under the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the POCSO Act and IT Act. Kalsi said, “Our teams began following the leads provided by the school. We questioned the victims, teachers and parents and identified 33 WhatsApp virtual numbers, five Instagram profiles and several calls using fake caller ID apps. We also analysed IP details of the WhatsApp, Instagram and fake email IDs and were able to zero in on Mahavir from Patna as the stalker.” Relating how the investigation identified Mahavir, the DCP said that while analysing the mobile numbers, police discovered that one of the numbers was used to contact one of the victims three years back and since then to stalk her. After the suspect was arrested from his residence in Patna, he was interrogated, during which the engineering students confessed to using apps for fake caller IDs and for virtual numbers on WhatsApp to contact the girls and teachers of the Delhi school. A police officer disclosed, "Mahavir also used a voice-changing app when contacting victims to hide his identity. He used an app to morph nude photos of the victims and upload them on fake Instagram profiles created in their names. Several obscene videos and photographs were also found on Mahavir’s mobile phone.” The investigators said that no monetary transactions were made and the accused claimed to have done everything for fun. “We checked the social media accounts and found he blackmailed people into revealing their phone numbers, so he could use them. However, there were no monetary transactions.” An officer privy to the investigation added, “Mahavir claimed that he liked a girl and was infatuated but later started looking for friends on Instagram and creating fake IDs and posting morphed pictures of the girls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-a-stranger-calls-iit-undergrad-used-tech-to-stalk-teachers-students/articleshow/86850213.cms||---

According to railway officials, the train, named as “Trishul” to indicate three trains being operated as a single train, was formed at Vijayawada and operated as a single train up to Duvvada, the last station bordering SCR jurisdiction. Normally, a normal goods train consists of 58 wagons or boxed wagons. This initiative was taken to speed up the operation of goods trains so that the empty wagons can be transported to their loading point in the least possible time. Initiatives like these help in meeting the demands of the customer expeditiously. For example, it helps in expeditiously meeting the demand of power houses for coal. This in turn also helps in reducing the wagon turnaround time so that the empty wagons are available within a shorter period for each loading journey. According to officials, the train, named as ‘Trishul’ to indicate three trains being operated as a single train, was formed at Vijayawada and operated as a single train up to Duvvada||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-division-runs-goods-train-with-176-wagons/articleshow/86852064.cms||---
---||Jaipur||CM directs officials prepare action plan to over come power crisis||Edited 473 words Times News Network Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Ghelot has directed officers to prepare an action plan to ensure power supply in the coming days on the basis of demand and availability. He also directed officials of the energy department to visit Chhattisgarh and monitor the availability of coal in the coal blocks located there and ensure that sufficient coal is available as per the requirements of the state. The chief minister was reviewing the power crisis facing the state due to shortage of coal in thermal power stations. The discoms said they were forced to go for load sheddings because of the coal shortage. It was informed at the meeting that wind power plants were also generating less power than installed capacity. The general public should be made aware about the deepening coal crisis in the country and the reduction in power generation capacity from thermal power plants due to not getting enough coal so that they should be encouraged to save electricity, the meeting observed. The present coal crisis is triggered by the waterlogging of coal mines due to unseasonal rains hampering production. Some units of thermal power plants in the state are not able to generate power at their full capacity causing a power shortage. The chief minister also asked the officials to ensure supply of coal rakes in sufficient quantities by coordinating with the central authorities for the transportation of available coal to the terminal power plants. Bhaskar A Sawant, chairman discoms, informed that due to the change in weather, the power demand had increased and it was at its peak at 3pm. The average demand for power is 12,500MW but only 8,500MW was available. He said power consumption had shown a sharp rise after October 4 and the difference in the peak hour power demand (3pm to 12 at night) is 2500MW forcing power cuts on the roster. He said against the daily requirement of 12 rakes of coal, the availability is only 7.5 rakes, which had affected thermal power units. The Surajgarh thermal power station had reduced generation by 2500 MW per day. Failure of state government:Raje Former chief minister and national vice-president of BJP Vasundhara Raje has said it was clearly the failure of the state government to deprive the people of the state basic facilities like electricity. She said domestic electricity, which used to be 24x7 during her tenure, is not getting even 24 minutes in villages today. Not only in villages, people in the cities are also troubled by powercuts. “Many power plants are closed and many are on the verge of closure. Due to the deepening power crisis, industries are getting affected, agriculture and education of children are also getting hit,” she said. In a statement, she said the state government did not pay for the coal on time triggering the present crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-directs-officials-prepare-action-plan-to-over-come-power-crisis/articleshow/86852132.cms||---

The state power utility Tangedco’s five thermal power stations at North Chennai, Tuticorin and Mettur have an average of just four days of coal stock left with them. Tangedco is in touch with the Union ministry of power and Coal India Limited (CIL) to ensure supply of the fuel. Tangedco, NTECL Vallur and NTPL Tuticorin have fuel supply agreements with Coal India Limited. There has been a fall in supplies from CIL since September last week. “While the consumption of coal by all stations on Wednesday was 60,265 tonnes, we received only 36,255 tonnes. The total stock at the end of the day was 1.92 lakh tonnes, which could last only for a few days,” a source told TOI. “We are hopeful of managing the crisis as we expect better supply in the coming days, he said. The stock in Tuticorin could last for 2.6 days, in Mettur for 3.4 days and in North Chennai for 2.2 days. With the daily supply still happening, though truncated, the plants can run for about four days. The dynamic management keeps the system going as renewable energy sources are coming in handy for the state. Hydropower generation shot up to 12 million units on Wednesday. While the total generation capacity of Tangedco thermal units is 4,320MW, the coal requirement is 62,000 tonnes a day. At 100% (which is not practically possible) plant load factor, the discom would need 72,000 tonnes of coal per day. Blame it on China’s power crisis and its desperate attempt to tap all coal markets, import of coal has drastically dropped in India. The coal price has shot up in the international market and the firms that have signed up long and medium-term power sale contracts are unable to fulfil the commitments. They are getting half of the required supply and have cut down generation. Tangedco is now purchasing about 20 million units of power per day from power exchange at rates ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 15 per unit. The average daily power consumption of Tamil Nadu is 290 million units. Since power consumption could fall during the next three months owing to drop in mercury level, power managers are confident of pulling on till January middle. NTECL Vallur, a joint venture of NTPC Limited and Tangedco, private power producers like IL&FS Tamil Nadu Power Company Limited’s coal-based power plant in Cuddalore, Mutiara Coastal Energen plant in Tuticorin, BALCO, DB Power Limited, KSK Mahanadi Power Company Limited and Jindal Power Limited have all been hit by coal shortage. “Coal India Limited is continuously monitoring it. The situation is precarious, especially this month. Tangedco is urging the Central agency to supply 64,000 tonnes a day but there is an average shortfall of 20,000 tonnes a day,” another official said. Mettur TPS requires 7.17 million tonnes of coal annually, while North Chennai TPS needs 10 million tonnes and Tuticorin 3.8 million tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tangedco-has-enough-coal-only-for-4-more-days/articleshow/86852111.cms||Julie Mariappan

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice over PIL on unsafe billboards||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the state government and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) over a PIL seeking to ensure safety provisions for erection of billboards and hoardings on footpath or superstructures, particularly at a time of natural calamities like the recent Tauktae cyclone. Petitioner Sanjay Joshi has urged the HC to direct authorities to undertake a survey and remove all those billboards, hoardings, LCD and LEDs displayed on roads or buildings once they are found dangerous to public safety. On behalf of the petitioner, advocates Neel and Dhwani Lakhani contended that there is absence of regulations regarding installation, as well as quality check of whether the advertisement materials could cause damage to life and property in case of any mishap. The structures on which such hoardings are placed also at times do not have appropriate stability to hold them. This was visible during the Tauktae cyclone when loss of life and property due to collapse of such hoardings was witnessed. Moreover, pedestrians are also at permanent risk due to erection of billboards because they are placed looking purely at commercial interest and there appears no propriety and regulation in their establishments. The General Development Control Regulations also lacks provisions to monitor and carry out quality check while erecting billboards. After preliminary hearing, the bench headed by Acting Chief Justice R M Chhaya sought reply from the authorities by November 17. The HC also mentioned a litigation of the year 2014 in its order when the Vadodara Municipal Corporation had agreed to ensure that it would not place advertisements creating obstacles for pedestrians on footpaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-pil-on-unsafe-billboards/articleshow/86850140.cms||---

Senior counsel Vikram Chaudhri, who appeared for the NCP leader, told a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and S V Kotwal that the manner in which the central agency issued summons and invoked Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) violated Deshmukh’s fundamental rights. The lawyer urged the bench to quash ED proceedings and sought interim directions to ED and CBI to not take coercive action against Deshmukh. He should be allowed to submit documents and his statement electronically, and ED should be restrained from compelling him to be present before it in person, the lawyer said. The NCP leader was a senior citizen and had come in contact with ED officials without social distancing over the last few months. He did not want to be present before agency officials in view of Covid, Chaudhri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-action-by-ed-mala-fide-says-deshmukh/articleshow/86852129.cms||---

The government said it was seeking allocation of 15 tmcft (with drawals of 75 tmcft) utilisation towards domestic water requirements for projected population up to 2051. “As per the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-1) clause VII of final order, only 20% of drawals made towards drinking water should be counted as consumptive use.  The Central Water Commission, in its latest reassessment of water availability study in India, has considered the consumptive use of domestic water utilisation as 15%,” engineer-in-chief (irrigation) C Muralidhar said in a letter addressed to chairman of KRMB on Thursday. In the letter, the government said with an aim to providing drinking water to all, Mission Bhagiratha scheme was taken up. Water is being drawn from all the old sources and the purpose is only to maintain minimum draw down levels to ensure that the water would be drawn for only drinking requirements below those levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/take-only-20-of-water-for-drinking-t-to-krmb/articleshow/86852114.cms||---

Mahto, a Class IV student of Sapphire School, was found in a pool of blood outside the teachers’ quarters on the school campus on the night of February 5, 2016. Binay’s father Manbahal Mahto had knocked the doors of the high court seeking an independent probe into the death of his son. Initial investigation by police revealed the involvement of Nazia Hussain, a Hindi teacher, her husband Arif Ali Ansari and her children. While the juveniles have already been acquitted by the Juvenile Justice Board, the two adults are on bail. Manbahal’s advocate Jitendra Singh informed the high court that there have been gross irregularities in the investigation which have come to light in course of the trial. The lower court conducting the trial summoned as many as 10 other persons against whom there appears to be a role in committing the murder of the child, Singh said. The court of Justice S K Dwivedi after hearing the case directed the government to file an affidavit in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-directs-state-to-file-affidavit-in-sapphire-school-student-murder-case/articleshow/86850583.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Health department readies plan to curb Covid-19 spike during puja||Ranchi: The state health department is planning to conduct random mask-checking drives and maintain a strict vigil in areas that are likely to record a high footfall of pandal-hoppers during Durga Puja next week to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases during and after the festive season. The department has also planned extensive screening of migrants at all entry and exit points of the state. Although the state government has banned congregations and pandal-hopping this year, the health department officials are apparently fearing massive crowds in pandals. Talking to TOI, state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “We have almost finalised our protocols for the upcoming festive season and they will be in sync with the directions received from the Union health ministry. We are going to be extremely cautious as the next 100 days will be critical and districts have been asked to maintain a constant vigil to prevent any further spread of the virus.” A senior state health department official said that if anyone is found violating Covid-appropriate behaviour during the checking drive, he/she will be penalised. As a precautionary measure, the testing capacity at all entry points has been intensified as migration is expected to go up during the festive period. The department has deployed mobile testing vans as well as static centres at all major junctions like Tatanagar, Ranchi, Chakradharpur, Bokaro and Dhanbad railways stations to screen passengers entering the state. “Currently, we are receiving around 3,500 samples on a daily basis from these centres and it is expected to increase in the days to come. Even testing at airports as well as those entering the state via roads is also being done,” an official said. Asked if the state will allow any kind of congregations during the Puja, Dr Karn said that the disaster management department’s July 31 order will be implemented across Jharkhand. “At the most, the local administration can allow a small number of people to assemble but that’ll only be done by keeping the GOI guidelines in mind which state that areas with a positivity rate of less than 5% can have small gatherings,” he added. According to a directive by the Union health ministry, districts with a positivity rate of 10% or more in a span of seven days and with a 60% bed occupancy in hospitals, be it oxygen-supported or in the Intensive Care Unit, need to enforce Covid-control measures. The states have been directed to enforce restrictions for at least 14 days at districts which cross the threshold limit during the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-readies-plan-to-curb-covid-spike-during-puja/articleshow/86850450.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand Congress leaders bound for Lakhimpur Kheri barred from entering UP||RANCHI: Hundreds of Congress workers from Jharkhand, led by party president Rajesh Thakur, cabinet ministers Banna Gupta (health) and Badal Patralekh (agriculture), who were headed for violence-torn Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh (UP) on Wednesday, were barred from entering the northern state in the early hours on Thursday. The Congress workers, numbering about 250, left for UP on cars under the aegis of the state party president Rajesh Thakur to protest against the detention of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and meet the family members of the deceased farmers who were killed by a speeding car, allegedly linked to Union minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. However, in the early hours of Thursday, they were stopped at Windhamganj on the Jharkhand-UP border by a large force of UP police. Confirming the incident, Thakur told TOI, “Stopping opposition leaders continuously from entering Uttar Pradesh has exposed the Yogi Adityanath government’s fear. First, they stopped and illegally detained our AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi for close to three days without allowing her to go Lakhimpur Kheri and now, we were stopped from entering UP.” Thakur added that a sea of policemen was on the border to stop their cavalcade. “From about midnight, we sat on the streets in protest against such high handedness. Now, we are returning. But we will lead a delegation to the violence-hit area in coming days,” he said, adding that after reaching Jharkhand, the party will continue to fight for justice to the bereaved family members of the deceased farmers and support the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws in all possible ways. In Ranchi, Congress spokesperson Rakesh Sinha described the situation in UP as “killing raaj”. He said, “In UP, the situation has turned into killing raaj, not Ram Rajya. And the culprits are at still at large,” he said, questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his silence over the issue even as the Supreme Court took a suo moto cognizance expressing concern over the incident. A total of eight persons, including a few BJP leaders, had died in Lakhimpur Kheri violence which broke out on Sunday (October 3) after four farmers were reportedly mowed down by a speeding car. Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish, is accused of driving the car even as he and his father had denied the allegations. Ashish has been booked by UP police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-cong-leaders-bound-for-lakhimpur-kheri-barred-from-entering-up/articleshow/86850657.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Power woes to deepen during festive days||RANCHI: Jharkhand may witness severe power outages in the coming festive days with the state’s lone thermal power generating unit — Tenughat Thermal Power Station (TTPS) at Lalpania in Bokaro district — reporting that it has only two days of coal stocks left. Talking to TOI, Anil Sharma, the managing director of state-run Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL), which owns TTPS, said, “Over the past several months, TTPS has been running only on one of its two units. We need at least two coal rakes every day to run our plant but we are receiving an average of one rake only.” He further said, “Even the supply of one rake of coal has not been regular over the past 2 weeks. We are receiving an average of one rake once in two to three days. As our reserve coal stocks are fully exhausted, we have to depend on daily supplies to run our plant.” Sharma added, “The Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) has assured us of regular coal supplies as per our requirements. However, due to heavy rains throughout September, the coal major is in a difficulty to meet our demands.” Moreover, TVNL owes around Rs 920 crore to CCL for buying coal. The entire power generated by TVNL is supplied to Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Ltd,(JBVNL), the state-owned power distribution company. Payments from JBVNL, too, has been irregular, putting TVNL is in great difficulty to clear its debts. JBVNL owes TVNL around Rs 4,700 crores, Sharma informed. Jharkhand needs around 1,200 MW daily, of which TVNL supplies around 154 MW while the Subarnarekha hydel power plant adds another 109 MW. The remaining balance of around 1000MW is met from the central pool and power purchases through the country’s power exchange.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhands-power-woes-to-deepen-during-festive-days/articleshow/86850727.cms||Tapas Biswas

The Bengali community is in a dilemma over organizing the Durga puja this time due to restrictions announced by the police department. The community members are not just upset but they said that their sentiments are being hurt by such ‘illogical’ Covid restrictions. “The police department has said that we can’t have a Durga pandal or celebrate the festival at an open party plot or ‘atithigruh’. So, where can we install the pandal and perform Durga puja? We gave assurance to the police that all the visitors will follow Covid protocols and wear face masks,” said Ritwik Majumder, general secretary, East West Cultural Association that has been organizing Durga puja in the city for the last 35 years. The association had booked a party plot in Subhanpura for organizing the puja. “We have been told that we can perform the puja in residential colonies but not at party plots. What is safer? Performing puja in a big party plot where devotees can maintain proper social distance or packing hundreds of people in a small area in some colony?” questioned Majumder. Every year about 18 Durga pandals are installed across the city and thousands from the Bengali community attend the puja. The community members said that they had expected to get permission for Durga pandal as the cops had allowed thousands of Ganesh pandals across the city this year. “Before Covid, about 1,000 devotees visited our pandal but last year we restricted the crowd to just 100. Even this year, we had decided to allow just 150 persons and follow all Covid guidelines. But the police circular banning pandals at party plots and ‘atithigruh’ is really disappointing,” said Kalyan Chatterjee, general secretary, Dakshin Baroda Sanskriti Parishad. “We have requested the police to give us permission to install Durga pandal at a party plot so that the festival can be celebrated safely,” Chatterjee told TOI. When contacted, city police commissioner Shamsher Singh said, “I have been apprised of their request. We are working out a solution to ensure that the Bengali community can celebrate Durga puja safely in the city.” The cops are likely to give permission for pandals under the category of cultural event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/illogical-covid-curbsupset-bengali-community/articleshow/86848216.cms||Tushar Tere

The PSA plants were constructed under the PM-Cares Fund and public sector undertakings like Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) and railways organised the inauguration by Modi in their respective hospitals. Earlier on Wednesday, state BJP leaders had boycotted the state’s inauguration of the PSA plants, terming it as an attack on cooperative federalism. In Ranchi, two inauguration events were organised — one at the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) hospital at Gandhinagar in Kanke in which state BJP President Deepak Prakash along with Kanke MLA Samri Lal attended the event, and the other at the divisional railway hospital at Hatia, where BJP’s Hatia MLA Navin Jaiswal took part. On more PSA plant was inaugurated at the Dhanbad Rail hospital where local MP P N Singh attended the event. Meanwhile, Ranchi administration officials confirmed that no state programme was organised for the CCL hospital event in Ranchi. DC Chhavi Ranjan said, “There was no programme from the district administration’s side but an event was organised at CCL, Gandhinagar.” There was, however, no clarity from the Deoghar district administration on whether any function was held at AIIMS, Deoghar.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Showers likely to play spoilsport during festival||Ranchi: Rain is likely to play spoilsport during the final days of Durga Puja festivities next week, the weather office here hinted on Thursday. Even though the trough of southwest monsoon has begun retreating from Jharkhand, southern and north-eastern parts of the state may witness rains during next week. “A well-marked low pressure area has formed over the north Andaman region in the Bay of Bengal. It is likely to gather more steam and convert into a cyclonic circulation around October 10 and head towards southern Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh to make landfall,” Abhishek Anand, scientist and IMD Ranchi, told TOI. “Under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, few parts of Jharkhand, namely the south-eastern and north-eastern districts, are likely to receive rain between October 14 and 15,” he added. The IMD’s forecast implied that cities like Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Chaibasa, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Dumka and Deoghar may receive rains during puja, which is scheduled between October 11 and October 15. However, the IMD’s extended fortnightly weather forecast, which was issued on Thursday afternoon, claimed that there would be no significant rainfall this week. “The trough of southwest monsoon is likely to withdraw completely from the state between October 13 and 15. So monsoon-induced rainfall in Jharkhand is unlikely during this period,” Anand claimed. The four-month monsoon season, which lasted from June 1 to September 30, brought normal rainfall to the state this year, courtesy of an active monsoon trough and several cyclonic circulations. The state received 1043.4 rain, which was slightly below Jharkhand’s cumulative normal average of 1054.7 mm. Cyclone Gulab also brought excess rains in the few days of this month. As per IMD'’s statistics, the state received 58mm rain between October 1 and October 7, which is 80% excess from its normal average during this time of year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/showers-likely-to-play-spoilsport-during-festival/articleshow/86850629.cms||Dhritiman Ray

However, the decision on whether to increase or decrease the number of devotees will be taken after a review of the initial days of the pilgrimage. Unlike in the previous season, when the pandemic was raging, this time holy dip in Pamba river will be allowed. It has also been decided to allow devotees above 65 years of age and children below 10 years of age at the hill shrine. It has also been decided to make it mandatory to provide RT-PCR negative certificate or a vaccination completion certificate to proceed to Sannidhanam for darshan. The darshan will be allowed only through virtual queue system. Vijayan said in the meeting that the prasadam of abhishekam (ghee) would be distributed to the devotees. For this, the CM said the Travancore devaswom board should make necessary arrangements, including setting up special counters. Meanwhile, no one will be allowed to stay at Sannidhanam at night. Like in the previous season, devotees will have to return soon after the darshan. The devotees will not be allowed to trek through the forest route of Erumeli and also through Pullumedu. Vehicles will be allowed only up to Nilackal. Special services of the KSRTC buses will be operated between Nilackal and Pamba. More facilities, including toilet facilities, will be developed at Pamba and Nilackal. The CM has asked the health department to increase the number of healthcare centres between Pamba and Sannidhanam. Those who have symptoms or post-Covid issues should avoid trekking the holy path. More oxygen parlours and cardiac centres will be set up along the trekking path. The meeting was attended by devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan, forest minister A K Saseendran, transport minister Antony Raju and water resources and irrigation minister Roshy Augustine along with the senior officials. Meanwhile, devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan said in the assembly that all basic facilities for the pilgrimage season are ready at Sabarimala.

His name was announced by the party high command after BJP formally announced Govind Kanda as its candidate on Thursday. INLD has already fielded Abhay Singh Chautala for the byelection. Beniwal will file his nomination on Friday in presence of senior party leader, and he is considered close to Haryana state Congress president Kumari Selja and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Once a close aide of INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala, Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal, 53, is expected to give a tough fight to Abhay Chautala for the third time consecutively. Beniwal had joined BJP in October 2014 after snapping his long association with Abhay. He then unsuccessfully contested the Ellenabad assembly election but lost from Abhay with a margin of around 12,000 votes.

It wants to be a complete food player by entering new product categories in high-margin segments. The company is hoping to achieve Rs 20,000 crore turnover in 2021-22. Emami Agrotech director Aditya Agarwal indicated that the company would look for entering new categories of food but not yet zeroed on anything. It is also planning to go national with spices on January 22. Now, the spice brand is marketed mainly in eastern region. According to him, the revenue of Emami Agrotech has gone up from Rs 10,000 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 12,000 crore in 2020-21 and has a quantum lip largely because of high edible oil prices as crude prices shoot up. However, he maintained that the margins of the company have rather gone down following high crude edible oil prices. The company has entered into the spices and soya chunks segment just before the pandemic though it now constitutes 2% of its turnover. It is also investing Rs 1000-1,500 crore in brand building and capex in next three years to achieve its target of Rs 25,000 crore turnover. The branded package sale contributes 60% of the revenue of the company. Emami Agrotech now has three refineries in Haldia, Jaipur and Krishnapatnam and is setting up a new unit at Kandla port along with a small unit in Mangalore.

---||World||WHO’s definition of post-Covid condition issued||NEW DELHI: To ensure affected patients get better care, the World Health Organisation has come up with a ‘clinical case definition’ of ‘post-Covid condition’, stating that it occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection, usually three months from its onset with symptoms, lasts for at least two months, and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. “Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others and generally have an impact on everyday functioning,” the definition states. “Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute Covid-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time,” it adds. The WHO makes it clear that a separate definition may be applicable for children. This definition is being cited by WHO as a first necessary step to optimise the recognition and care of persons experiencing ‘post Covid-19 condition’ in community and healthcare settings. The definition covers 12 domains, including the sequelae of well-described Covid complications like stroke and heart attack. The WHO report also states that no minimal number of symptoms are required for diagnosis. It puts out a full list of described symptoms included in the survey. These range from abdominal pain, menstrual and period problems, anxiety, depression to chest pain, cough, new onset of allergies, intermittent fever and sleep disorders among others. Over the course of the pandemic, various terminologies including ‘long Covid’, ‘long-haul Covid’ or the WHO-defined ‘post Covid-19 condition’ have been proposed. Still, a globally standardised clinical case definition of this condition is lacking. Now, this definition seeks to fill that gap in an evolving situation. As of August 2021, over 210 million confirmed cases of Covid and more than 4.4 million deaths have been reported to the WHO. “Most patients with Covid-19 return to baseline after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a proportion report ongoing health issues,” it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/whos-definition-of-post-covid-condition-issued/articleshow/86855798.cms||Ambika Pandit

The seven PSA oxygen plants set up in Goa under the PM Cares fund will ensure Goa is self sufficient and won’t have to depend on other states, he said. “We are fully prepared for any third wave. There won’t be a shortage. The health department has sufficient storage tanks to store extra oxygen in the state,” Sawant said while inaugurating the PSA plants at the ESI Hospital and South Goa district hospital (SGDH), on Thursday. The state of the health authorities during the peak of the second wave was that of waiting for oxygen tankers to come in, waiting for LMO tanks to get filled with IAS officers and various authorities monitoring and coordinating with district collectors in Maharashtra and Karnataka as well as reaching out to central ministers in anticipation of receiving oxygen tankers. The infrastructure in place will help the state deal with any kind of health crisis in the future, health minister Vishwajit Rane said. “Something that never came to our mind was how important oxygen can be and what role oxygen had in this whole pandemic. This is being done today as we are not taking any kind of chances and we will be able to deal with any kind of pandemic in the future, even in the periphery,” Rane said. “We have plants at most large hospitals, but having oxygenated beds in every hospital is very important and we have learnt that importance through the pandemic,” he said. The PSA oxygen plant at the SGDH was virtually dedicated to the state by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Uttrakhand through a virtual function. Similar plants have been set up at Goa Medical College its new super-speciality block, Asilo hospital and Chicalim sub-district hospital. When asked whether the plants are functional, Sawant said all have been commissioned but some await NABL certification from Bangalore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goas-o2-self-sufficiency-up-with-2-more-plants/articleshow/86851065.cms||---

---||Goa||Rane, Godinho spl invitees on BJP nat’l executive panel||Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane and transport minister Mauvin Godinho have been inducted as special invitees to the BJP national executive committee announced on Thursday. Sources said the appointments show the importance the party is giving to the two in the run-up to the assembly polls and also to the strengthening of BJP during this assembly term. Both came from Congress. Recently both were inducted in the BJP state core committee. Godinho joined BJP before the 2017 assembly election and helped it sweep the Mormugao taluka. Despite a Congress whip, Rane remained absent for the crucial vote of confidence moved by then chief minister Manohar Parrikar who had cobbled up a government of three parties and independents. After the floor test, Rane had resigned as Congress MLA and joined BJP. He was later inducted into the cabinet as health minister. Sources said that as the 2022 polls are just 4-5 months away, BJP needs Rane to get the numbers mainly in Sattari and Bicholim talukas. The party is working on strategies to ensure that all its MLAs remain with the party amid speculation that some are planning to quit one to two months before the polls. Similarly, BJP wants Godinho to play a role in retaining all four seats in Mormugao taluka. In Godinho, the party wants to show at the national level that BJP has the support of all communities in the state. For BJP, both Rane and Godinho have performed as ministers and that was also considered for their induction in the 50-member special invitee, the sources said. Other members on the national executive committee include Union minister for state Shripad Naik, chief minister Pramod Sawant, deputy chief ministers Manohar Ajgaonkar and Chandrakant Kavlekar and former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, apart from BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. BJP general secretary (organisation) Satish Dhond is also a member of the national executive. He said that due to the pandemic, the national executive committee was not constituted, and that this committee will continue till the end of national president J P Nadda’s tenure. Both Rane and Godinho said that it is a great honour to be appointed to the national executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-godinho-spl-invitees-on-bjp-natl-executive-panel/articleshow/86851132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: MLA Gopal Kanda's brother gets BJP ticket||CHANDIGARH: Within three days of joining the BJP, Govind Kanda, brother of controversial MLA Gopal Kanda, has been nominated by the saffron party for the Ellenabad byelection in Sirsa district of Haryana. Govind, who was running his own outfit, Haryana Lokhit Party, along with his brother had no affiliation with BJP in the past but his “late father Murli Dhar’s connection” with Jan Sangh has reportedly worked in his favour.  Even in his profile sent to the BJP high command, seeking party ticket from Ellenabad, Kanda had mentioned his family’s “deep-rooted” connection with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and their family’s image of being a “nationalist” and “gau rakshaks” (protectors of cows) as the main grounds seeking his nomination for the high-octane bypoll slated for October 30. As per the dossier sent by Govind for his claim on party ticket, he has relied on his father’s connection with the RSS since 1926. He has also attached the documents showing his father Murli Dhar as Jan Sangh candidate from Dabwali assembly seat of joint Punjab in the first general elections held in 1952 and his works done as “gau bhakt”. He went on to mention his father’s dream — that one day there will be a government led by “gau bhakts” and “nationalists” in the country. Further to highlight the “nationalist” approach of his family, he also stated how his father had fed the military personnel at Sirsa Railway station during the 1965 war, when troops halted at the local station. In his request to serve the saffron party, Govind had also stated that he inherited the qualities of “social services” and “philanthropy” only because of his father’s connection with RSS. To reflect his “gau bhakti”, he also mentioned that he has paid donations to more than 100 cow shelters. His brother Gopal Kanda, who was also accused in cases related to airhostess Geetika suicide case, was elected as independent MLA in 2009 and supported the then Bhupinder Singh Hooda government. However, he lost the ministerial berth after his name surfaced in the Geetika suicide case. Later both the brothers had formed the Haryana Lokhit Party. Govind also unsuccessfully contested two state assembly elections in the state. One was in 2014 from Rania seat of Sirsa district, when he lost with a margin of only 2,000 votes and second time from the same seat in 2019 when he lost the election to Ranjit Singh, who is presently power and jail minister in Haryana. His brother is sitting MLA from Sirsa seat and has been supporting Manohar Lal Khattar led BJP-JJP government from outside. A millionaire businessman, Govind (54) has disclosed his qualification as completed “General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (GCE A-Level) in November 2015 from Cambridge International examinations. During the nominations, he was accompanied by several senior leaders including Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal, JJP state president Nishan Singh, state BJP president O P Dhankar, Ellenabad byelection in-charge Subhash Barala and others. Sources added Govind is well known in the area and has the capacity to spend money in his campaign. Being the nominee of the ruling party would be an advantage for him. However, the biggest challenge before the BJP would be the opposition by farmers against party leaders during the campaign in view of their agitation against the Centre’s agriculture laws. As per the affidavit filed by Govind, he is facing an FIR regarding unauthorised construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kandas-brother-is-bjp-nominee-in-ellenabad-bypoll/articleshow/86852201.cms||Ajay Sura

Researchers at the faculty of family and community sciences had designed the bench keeping in mind the large footfall of people at various public places once the Covid curbs are lifted. “During the lockdown we were deliberating about how social distance can be maintained at institutions and public places. So, we came up with this design which can keep a distance between two people and will also be easy to sanitize,” said Dr Sarjoo Patel, assistant professor. Patel along with Fatema Dahodwala, a teaching assistant, and a PhD student Khyati Trivedi have secured the patent for this design. The bench, made of aluminium, can be easily sanitized for its structure while the cushion seats are made up of foam and rexine. “There is a distance of one metre between the two seats and we have placed hooks so that people can hang their bags, bottles and other valuables without touching any of the surfaces,” Patel said. She added that the bench can be placed at railway stations, bus stations, hospitals, airports, offices among other places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/innovative-msu-bench-bags-patent/articleshow/86848011.cms||---

Considering a petition filed by a restaurant owner seeking police protection against unions demanding ‘nokkukooli’, Justice Devan Ramachandran termed the illegal practice of demanding gawking charges as “militant trade unionism” and said the term ‘nokkukooli’ shouldn’t be heard in the state from now on. The court declared that any demand of ‘nokkukooli’ or any similar demand by any person, headload worker, or union is illegal and unlawful. The court directed station house officers of police to take stringent action, including invoking provisions of Indian Penal Code, against violators and said perpetrators should be brought to book without any leniency, whatever be the colour of the flag they are working under or whatever flag they may hold allegiance to. Unions demand exorbitant amounts as ‘nokkukooli’ from employers engaging own workers, instead of union workers, for loading and unloading citing loss of work or lost wages, on the strength of their right to work under the Kerala Headload Workers Act. For entrepreneurs to be not intimidated from coming and operating in Kerala, a peaceful atmosphere should prevail in the realm of labour and employment, the court said. It would be possible only if the headload workers and the unions act totally within the confines of the Act, the bench said while ordering strict action against those demanding ‘nokkukooli’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-equates-unions-demanding-nokkukooli-in-state-to-militants/articleshow/86850235.cms||---

He was reacting to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s announcement of pothole-free roads in Goa by November 1. Dhavalikar also demanded a white paper on the finances of the state and said that the government has “sold jobs” in the state. “Forget filling 10,000, it would be great if they manage to fill 5,000 vacancies. Newspapers have revealed that jobs were sold and when we inquired we learnt that it is true.” On the upcoming state polls, Dhavalikar said that if some industrialist financially supports MGP then the party can win the 2022 assembly elections. On the auspicious day of Navratri he urged people to defeat “the evil forces that exists in the state” as well the new political parties that have entered the state and are luring people with money to save Goa. Speaking about the government’s promise to provide 10,000 jobs to the people of the state, Dhavalikar said, The MGP leader also said that the party has started work in 12 constituencies and within 15 days MGP will finalize plans for the remaining constituencies. MGP is planning to contest around 24 seats in the upcoming polls. The party will start its election campaign after Diwali and decided on its list of candidates. After November 4, MGP will take out a Rath Yatra and cover every taluka Dhavalikar said, adding that the yatra will be completed in 18 days through November and December. He said that the party will inform people about the work done when the MGP government was in power in the state. Dhavalikar also said that MGP had not started any talks with BJP and that his party is open to alliance talks with regional parties. On aligning with AAP, Dhavalikar said that talks were on for a while but “after that there was no progress”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-wont-fulfil-pothole-promise-by-nov-1-mgp/articleshow/86851262.cms||---

The present government has 27 MLAs from the saffron party. “Somebody asked me why only 22-plus in 2022 when BJP currently has 27 MLAs and the support of one independent legislator. I told the person that we’ve decided to win over 22 seats in the upcoming assembly elections but have not decided how many above that number. It could be 23, 24, 26 or even 28 seats,” Sawant said. The CM went on to say, “With ‘navi sakal’, BJP will win 27 seats,” in an obvious swipe at the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC), which has been making inroads into the state’s political landscape with the catchphrase, ‘Goenchi navi sakal’ (new dawn for Goa). Political observers said Sawant’s statement was indicative of BJP’s confidence that TMC’s re-entry would eat into Congress’ vote bank as TMC, which has decided to contest the 2022 assembly polls independently, has been inducting former senior Congress functionaries and workers. In the 2012 state elections, it had a vote share of less than two per cent. Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao had even contested the Lok Sabha elections on a TMC ticket in 2014. During his recent visit, Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis had told party workers to set a target to win 22 seats in 2022. On Wednesday, Sawant had said that BJP tickets have not been assured to all sitting party MLAs . He said allotment would be based on the MLAs’ performance, indicating that some non-performers may face the axe. He had also said that the job of allotting tickets is done by the party centrally, but that recommendations for tickets would go from the state BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-will-win-22-seats-final-number-undecided-sawant/articleshow/86851231.cms||---

Justice S M Subramaniam ordered the government not to give permission henceforth for putting up structures or statues in highways, public places, and poromboke land parcels, and directed the state to frame guidelines for erecting statues. The court also ordered the government to create ‘leaders’ park’ at several places across the state. Only statues erected with proper permission must be relocated and maintained at the park and the cost of maintaining the statues must be recovered from those who had erected them, the court said. The judge was passing the order on a plea moved by M Veeraraghavan challenging the notice issued by tahsildar of Arakonam taluk to remove an Ambedkar statue erected on a meikal poramboke without permission. Refusing to entertain the plea, Justice Subramaniam said: “Erection of statues is made at the whims and fancies of political parties, communal, religious, linguistic, regional and sectional groups in various forms.” No doubt, they are entitled to celebrate the glory of those leaders. But, while erecting a statue in a public place, regulation is of paramount importance as ideas, ideologies and practices may differ from one group to another group, the judge said. “Unity in diversity is the Constitution’s principle and the glory of our great nation. This being the constitutional mandate, equality, non-discrimination, regulation are of constitutional importance to preserve the unity in diversity principle and to march towards the vibrant democracy,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-more-new-statues-in-tamil-nadu-shift-existing-ones-to-special-parks-says-madras-high-court/articleshow/86855916.cms||Suresh Kumar

As Palolem beach is a popular international tourist destination, the dilapidated road was portraying Goa in poor light, the activists said. The Congress workers filled the potholes with rubble, flattened the stretch and then poured a mixture of cement and sand. Citizens were facing the brunt owing to the decrepit road, while the authorities failed to temporarily take up repair work despite dry weather spells, they said. Those who participated in the exercise were Canacona Congress chief Pralay Bhagat and other party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/youth-cong-repairs-palolem-road/articleshow/86851606.cms||---
---||Business||If Facebook is problem, is social media regulator the fix?||WASHINGTON: Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen told Congress on Tuesday that one option for making social media less harmful would be to create a dedicated regulatory agency to oversee companies like Facebook, which could have former tech workers on staff. “Right now, the only people in the world who are trained to ... understand what’s happening inside of Facebook, are people who grew up inside of Facebook or Pinterest or another social media company,” she said during a hearing before a Senate Commerce Committee panel. How social media companies should be regulated has been a topic of intense debate among lawmakers, regulators and experts. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has been blasted by over a lack of transparency into how its platforms work, its handling of user data and the impact of its sites on users. Haugen, a former product manager at the company who leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal, said the profit motive was strong enough that Facebook, which owns Instagram, would not change without pressure. “Until incentives change at Facebook, we should not expect Facebook to change. We need action from Congress,” she said. Haugen also said that if she were made CEO of Facebook, she would immediately establish a policy that would allow it to share internal research with Congress and other oversight bodies, calling for transparency and public scrutiny of Facebook’s systems and decisions. Read AlsoFacebook fuels division, harms children, needs to be regulated: WhistleblowerThe testimony in US Congress by ex-employee Frances Haugen has fueled one of Facebook's most serious crises yet, and prompted a denial from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said in a post on his account that her claim the company prioritizes profit over safety was "just not true." Haugen testified onNathaniel Persily, a Stanford Law School professor who resigned last year from an effort aiming to get Facebook to share more data with researchers, has argued for legislation to compel social media companies to share their data with external researchers. “The platforms thrive in secrecy and if you subject them to outside review, it will change their behaviour,” he said. Persily said that as action is needed within the next year, he favoured the Federal Trade Commission managing the process. “You go to war with the army you have, not the army you may want,” he said, though he said a new cabinet department could later be created. Former Facebook executive Brian Boland, who was in charge of the company’s partnership data before resigning this year, said improving transparency was “step one in any kind of regulatory regime”. Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he envisaged a new, separate agency with the bandwidth and specialism to establish and enforce standards for Big Tech, including on privacy. Read AlsoFacebook whistleblower's allegations should be investigated by regulators: US senatorUnited States lawmakers pounded Facebook on Tuesday, accusing chief executive officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety and they demanded that regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children andOn Tuesday, Facebook spokeswoman Lina Pietsch said the company had itself long asked for government oversight. “We have been calling for updated regulations ourselves for two and a half years,” she said. Facebook has previously called for regulation of the internet, including a digital regulator. Some commentators raised caveats around the idea: Kyle Taylor, program director for a group of critics called the Real Facebook Oversight Board, said a regulator was essential but cautioned against creating a “revolving door” of former employees from social media companies joining the body. Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St John’s University Law School who studies social media governance, tweeted that such an agency should not be in charge of misinformation as an issue. During Tuesday’s hearing, Haugen also encouraged lawmakers to reform Section 230. She urged the law be changed to hold companies accountable for their algorithms, which often decide what social media users see when they sign in. “They (companies) have 100% control over their algorithms and Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritise growth and virality and reactiveness over public safety. They shouldn’t get a free pass on that because they’re paying for their profits right now with our safety,” she said. Facebook has said it is in favour of a reform of Section 230 to give the companies immunity from liability only if they follow best practices. At the hearing, lawmakers did not push back at Haugen’s suggestions for various reforms but, in many cases, pointed to legislation aimed along similar lines. A bipartisan group of senators, including Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, introduced a bill in June that would require big internet platforms to allow users to view content that has not been decided by an algorithm. Haugen also encouraged raising age limits for users of Facebook’s platforms from 13 to 16 or 18, given addiction issues on the sites and children’s issues with self-regulation. Under current law, children 12 and under have more protection online than teenagers. There is a bill before Congress to raise the age to 15, among other changes. Facebook announced in late September, shortly after a report based largely on documents from Haugen that Instagram was harmful to teenagers, that it was pausing its work on a version of Instagram aimed at younger users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/if-facebook-is-problem-is-social-media-regulator-the-fix/articleshow/86855904.cms||---

---||Goa||Unesco edu report exposed BJP govt: AAP||Panaji: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday slammed the state government over the Unesco report stating it has only confirmed BJP’s complete failure in the eduction sector. Goa AAP’s vice-president and spokesperson Valmiki Naik said that with the report chief minister Pramod Sawant stood exposed on his tall claims on education. The disclosure that 239 schools are either single teacher run or have no more than two teachers is enough evidence to show how BJP has treated eduction in the state, AAP said. “The report stated that Goa was the second worst when it came to single teacher schools and is just below Arunachal Pradesh in the race to the bottom. Sawant’s tall statements of the state being no. 1 in the education sector have crashed to the ground with this report. Along with this, schools are also lacking in future-ready infrastructurewith 84% not even having computer labs.” The statistics skew the student teacher ratio and puts the burden on the teacher to teach multiple classes while children fail at learning outcomes, the party said, asking how Goan children were expected to excel in studies or complete globally. “On top of this 10% of Goa’s teachers are underqualified at the pre-primary level with unqualified teachers being a feature at even secondary and higher secondary levels. With only 16% of schools having a computer lab one must ask, how is the BJP government is making our youth future ready?” the party asked. The BJP has already created a digital divide between urban and rural students of Goa but now it seems they are creating an educational divide as well, AAP said, adding that during the lockdown cases of students having no access to the internet or mobile connectivity became a daily occurrence. “The issue is prominently faced by students in rural areas like Sattari, Sanguem and Cancona. Students had to walk miles in search of range and even climb mountains. They had to sit in rains under umbrellas and attend classes. This puts a huge strain on them and even risks their health. Students in some places had to face problems of wild animals too, like bisons and wild boars, while looking for network. This becomes worse when you consider that girls going in forest areas or isolated areas are at risk of molestation or sexual assault also as such areas are not safe,” the party stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unesco-edu-report-exposed-bjp-govt-aap/articleshow/86851944.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
