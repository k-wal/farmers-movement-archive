---||India||Myanmar refugee influx blamed for Covid surge in Mizoram||GUWAHATI: With Mizoram recording 15,270 active Covid-19 cases as of Monday, the highest among all the northeastern states, border district officials attributed this late surge to the arrival of displaced refugees from Myanmar, amid a fresh offensive launched by the military there, and trading activities across the porous border.  While Mizoram health department has admitted that many of the refugees were infected with the coronavirus before they arrived, border district officials said they are posing a big threat to villages on the Indian side. Champhai and Hnahthial are the two most vulnerable districts in Mizoram as they have had to bear the brunt of the refugees. People in these districts fear more refugees could cross over for shelter. District officials said the two districts currently have around 6,000 displaced people from Myanmar.  There is no opposition to providing shelter to the refugees as the state government is also supporting it, along with local village organisations. But allowing asymptomatic people, who may have passed the RAT screening, to mingle with the local residents has not only posed a threat to public health, it may also have serious consequences on other northeastern states.  Deputy commissioner of Champhai, Maria CT Zuali, told TOI on Monday that refugees are suspected to have contributed to the rise in the Covid-19 cases in the district, along with trade activities among villagers from both sides of the international border. As per official records, there were 3,972 displaced Myanmarese nationals in Champhai, as on September 24. Of them, around 33 tested positive during screening immediately after entering India.  "They carried the virus from the other side of the border and all of them were asymptomatic. We fear that some of them, who were found negative in RAT testing, came in touch with some local villagers and spread the virus," said Zuali.  On Sunday, Champhai had the second highest positivity rate at 6.55 per cent among Mizoram districts. And there is a fear that sympathy from bordering villagers that brought them in contact with the displaced may have a cascading impact.  The local villagers are arranging temporary shelters for the refugees on the outskirts of their localities, though the district administration and health department are making all efforts to vaccinate the 18-plus.  "The refugee factor is there. People here are used to buying onions, garlic and apples from Myanmar traders. Both have contributed to the virus spread," Zuali added. The refugees, who tested positive, are quarantined, but the rest are buying food and other essentials from local shops.  Even if the international border remains sealed now, people living in nearby villages are likely to buy food products through the porous border.  The broader picture revealed that the cases are both from rural and urban areas of Mizoram, with Aizawl district contributing more than half of the cases. The majority of the cases in Aizawl district are from the state capital Aizawl, which is well connected with Assam capital Guwahati and other metros of the country through Lengpui airport.  Dr Pachuau Lalmalsawma, state nodal officer and spokesperson for Covid-19, said that the newly detected cases are mostly from primary high risk contacts of recent Covid-19 positive persons, following aggressive search for cases across the state.  He said possible reasons for the current upsurge is the presence of Covid-19 new variants in the state – Delta, Delta plus, Alpha, Eta and other variants of interests listed under Delta family. "Continuing small scale community transmission in the state is a reason for the upsurge," said Lalmalsawma.  He said aggressive and active search for new cases by Police Contact-tracing Teams in collaboration with local or village-level Covid-19 task forces at the grassroots level has unearthed a large number of hidden cases.  But Lalmalsawma, too, admitted that the displaced from Myanmar are also affected by the pandemic. "Respective district health authorities are doing their best to detect or contain any event in those places and the activities are being monitored," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/myanmar-refugee-influx-blamed-for-covid-surge-in-mizoram/articleshow/86760810.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||India||Bengal's dole politics will not solve poverty, joblessness: Ashok Lahiri||KOLKATA: Noted economist and BJP’s Balurghat MLA Ashok Lahiri on Monday said that the dole politics pursued by the West Bengal government will not pull the state out of poverty and joblessness. The former chief economic advisor to the Government of India has also said that the claim of the state government to have the 7.16 per cent growth in terms of per capita income may not hold true if compared at constant prices.  “The finance minister of the state has pointed out that in terms of per capita income West Bengal has grown by 7.16 per cent in 2020-21. I congratulate the state for the achievement. But, he (state finance minister Amit Mitra) should also remember that the 7.16 per cent growth is measured at the current prices. If we measure it by constant prices (of 2011-12) the growth is just 0.67 per cent,” Lahiri said.  Lahiri also argued that the state’s performance should be compared with the developed states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana. “Bengal has fared well in comparison to these states. But there is nothing surprising in that. Financial year 2020-21 was exceptional due to the pandemic. During the period, the supply chain had collapsed, industrial production was down and migrant workers went back home. The more industrialised states were naturally hit hard,” he added.  Lahiri noted that the state’s rank in terms of per capita income has come down from among the top 10 in 1980 to 20 in 2019-20 — placed just ahead of Nagaland.  Pointing at the flip side of the dole politics, he said that West Bengal government has boosted welfare schemes to increase the demand. “But we have to see if that demand is being met by the developed states (instead of domestic supply). Government can continue giving out dole, but that will not pull the state out of poverty and joblessness,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengals-dole-politics-will-not-solve-poverty-joblessness-ashok-lahiri/articleshow/86761730.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Mumbai||Mumbai to give dandiya-garba nights a miss for second year in a row||Love to don a pretty odhni, swirl in colourful skirts and kediyas and tap your dandiya sticks in sync at Navratri? Well, this time, too, you may have to enjoy that at your own home as celebrations will not be taking place outdoors in Mumbai. With festivals being kept low-key due to the pandemic, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has not permitted garba within city limits keeping safety measures in mind. Mumbai’s revellers, who are understandably disappointed with the news, share how they’re going to miss the usual masti-mazaa for the second year running... ‘Previously, we would go out to play, sleep late and still be fresh the next day’A huge part of the fun is wearing outfits with matching jewelleryFor city folks, the pre-pandemic fun was all about family, friends and bonhomie. Santacruz-based entrepreneur Shital Kakad says, “I understand that safety is crucial in these times, but I will miss playing garba with my friends outside. We used to regularly head to the celebration at Juhu 1st Road and to Falguni Pathak’s event. We’d co-ordinate our steps and it was also fun to watch others playing around us. We had so much josh and energy. We would make impromptu plans to have a late night meal after our dance, sleep in the wee hours and still be fresh for the dance the next day.” A huge part of the festivity is wearing those sparkling chaniya cholis and colourful kediyas as there were competitions for the best dressed players. Tanvi Makim, a digital marketer and avid dandiya player, says, “I’m a die-hard Navratri fan and enjoy dressing up for the dandiya-garba dances. In fact, I always have nine different outfits with matching jewellery and headgear for each Navratri night. It was so disappointing when we couldn’t dress up last year and go out. This year, too, it’s going to be that way. Dressing up and playing at home just won’t feel the same.” ‘There are space constraints when you play at home’Some Mumbaikars have decided to make the most of the situation. Chintan Vora, a Kandivali-based businessman, says, “We are looking forward to playing dandiya-garba at home.But there will be space constraints. Music will also have to be kept low as we cannot disturb our neighbours. Overall, the enthusiasm is low.” Others have been fine-tuning their moves in small practice sessions just to stay in touch with the Navratri dance fervour. Interior designer Krupali Lathia, who is part of a garba group, has been teaching traditional steps to people. She says, “We have been conducting offline classes with all COVID-19 safety norms in place. There are temperature checks, we have sanitising stands and only those who are double vaccinated are allowed in the class. Also, it takes place in a large studio, which has a capacity of 50, but only 20 are allowed at a time. Many have signed up to brush up their moves and some just enjoy the opportunity of playing in the class.” Priti Gala, who won prizes at Navratri for garba, recalls, “In 2020, we played dandiya in a low-key manner with just family. This time, too, we may do that at a relatives’ place. Since I have a large space at my home, I’ve been practising steps with a few friends for a month. Playing garba is in our blood, kuch alag hi bond ho jaata hai.” ‘In pre-COVID times, this would be a packed time for orchestra groups’For orchestra owners, this would be a busy timeA key element of the dandiya celebration is the pulsating music that gets folks grooving. But with a ban on outdoor dance festivities, bands and orchestras cannot play outside. Musician and orchestra owner Nikhil Shah recalls how September-October would usually be a packed time. He says, “Earlier for Navratri, we would play to a 15,000-strong crowd and the preparation would start right from March. We had to get close to 27 permissions — fire, noise, crowd, security, police etc, as well as numerous rehearsals to be done. Then there was stage and ground prep, along with social media and advertising; I would hardly sleep during these nine nights. However, now that no outdoor celebrations are allowed, it is bound to mean a loss for us this year, too. The pandemic situation has hampered our incomes badly.” NOT ALLOWEDAs per the guidelines, no public celebrations will be allowed for Navratri 2021. Dandiya and garba events have been prohibited in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-give-dandiya-garba-nights-a-miss-for-second-year-in-a-row/articleshow/86761655.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||Bengaluru||Man who worked as Bahrain cop and ran international drug ring nabbed||BENGALURU: A man from Kerala, who had worked as a policeman with the Bahrain State Police and smuggled hashish to the Gulf via air cargo, was nabbed by Narcotics Control Bureau sleuths on September 29 in Bengaluru. He had been on the run since September 12. A preliminary probe revealed he procured drugs from Manali and transported them to Kochi via Bengaluru. Sources with the NCB Bengaluru zonal unit said the drug kingpin, only identified as a 52-year-old man from Kerala, was arrested from a train here when he was returning from Manali. “The suspect, who had been running a syndicate for about three years, smuggled drugs mainly to Bahrain. He knew the route and rules very well as he had been a police officer in Bahrain for nearly 20 years and had returned to Kerala around 2014 to settle down. With immense knowledge of law enforcement in the Gulf nation, he clandestinely began the drug trade,” explained an investigating officer. With the NCB Kochi team getting wind of his activities, sleuths on September 12 intercepted a courier consignment in Ernakulam meant to be shipped to Bahrain and unearthed 3.5kg of hashish oil worth about Rs 1 crore that was declared as ayurvedic medicines. Following this, a hunt was launched for the kingpin who managed to elude investigators. It was established that he procured the contraband from a dealer in Himachal Pradesh, brought it to Bengaluru, then took it to Kochi before smuggling it to Bahrain. With specific information, the Bengaluru NCB team tracked him to a train by which he was returning from Manali after meeting his contacts. He was arrested and booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Based on his confession, Kochi NCB team nabbed his accomplice on Monday, sources added. A probe is under way into the smugglers’ Bengaluru links.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-who-worked-as-bahrain-cop-and-ran-international-drug-ring-nabbed/articleshow/86772174.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Delhi||A new mural in Paharganj to mark Germany’s 31st reunification anniversary||On the German Unity Day on Sunday, Walter J Lindner, Ambassador of Germany unveiled a mural created by the Delhi Street Art group celebrating Indo-German friendship at Paharganj, near the New Delhi Railway Station. Walter J Lindner, Ambassador of Germany Walter J Lindner, Ambassador of Germany, said, “It is an important day for Germany, it’s our National Day of reunification and it is when 31 years ago, east and west Germany reunited. Usually, we’d host a big reception but due to the COVID restrictions, we couldn’t do it this year. Last year, we had re-recorded Scorpion’s iconic song Wind Of Change with Indian musicians. This year, we thought, we’d do something different but with an artistic twist. That’s how we got in touch with Yogesh Saini and his team from Delhi Street Art. The idea was to have something, which is typical of Berlin – a wall that is a reminder of the Berlin Wall and of the graffiti that you still find on parts of it. We found an old wall next to a popular cinema hall in Paharganj, and we had Yogesh and his team paint it. What could represent the friendship between the two nations in an eye-catching way? We searched for a wall, not in the Diplomatic Enclave, but in the centre of the city where everyone can look at it.” German Embassy searched for a wall, not in the Diplomatic Enclave, but in the centre of the city where everyone can look at itYogesh Saini of Delhi Street Art added, “German Embassy officials contacted us to paint a wall in the city where it is visible. We found this location in Paharganj and took permission, and worked on it for five days. When I learned that we would have an opportunity to create something meaningful to mark the German unification, my thoughts were on how to represent the friendship between India and Germany. What better way than representing an Indian woman wearing a traditional Bavarian dress and a German woman donning an Indian sari? While this idea was taking shape, I realised the most vivid visuals from the German unification were those of the graffiti and the art on the Berlin Wall. With that in mind, I saw the opportunity to represent a tiny section of a graffiti wall on the lower section of this art wall that we have created.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-new-mural-in-paharganj-to-mark-germanys-31st-reunification-anniversary/articleshow/86761168.cms||Niharika Lal
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka Congress counting on new unity to challenge BJP||BENGALURU: With the infighting in Karnataka Congress dying down, party functionaries are approaching the bypolls in the Sindgi (Vijayapura) and Hangal (Haveri) assembly segments with greater vigour. The discomfiture in BJP over issues such as price rise and change of guard is making them more confident. “People are yearning for change in the state and the upcoming bypolls will possibly give an indication to this effect,” said KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed. The elections are slated for October 30. But Congress has said the same thing before every election in the past two years. Each time, the outcome was not in its favour. And it won’t be easy this year either: the Sindgi and Hangal constituencies are dominated by the Lingayat community, which tends to back BJP. Despite challenges, the saffron camp is unlikely to leave anything to chance. It has already activated its well-oiled election machinery and blood-level management and may rely on the development plank again. “Hangal has been our constituency, whereas Sindgi was a JD(S) fort. We are 100 per cent sure of winning both the seats, largely because ours is a disciplined party that has its cadre from booth level to the national level,” said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. Congress still suffers from a lack of solid organisation at the ground. It is also said that there are more senior functionaries than workers in the party. There was a major factional tussle for prominence in the party earlier, but there seems to be some consensus between DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah now. Congress is also getting some traction among people. Much, however, will depend on caste equations and how many Lingayat votes the grand old party can swing in its favour. “These two bypolls are critical for BJP as they are in north Karnataka. This is in and around the electoral base of Bommai, who is facing bypolls for the first time after becoming the chief minister. It will be a test of his leadership and capacity to get the party cadres galvanised,” said political analyst Sandeep Shashtri. He believes Congress also needs to make an impact to gain some momentum before the 2023 state elections. “The Congress unity will be tested in the October 30 bypolls,” he added. Congress insiders say there is already a race to help supporters of Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah get the tickets. “We did well in the Belagavi Lok Sabha and Maski bypolls held in May mainly because we fielded the right candidates,” said a senior party functionary from Vijayapura. Can the Shivaumar-Siddaramaiah combo get the selection right and upset Bommai and BJP’s plans? The question will be answered on November 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-congress-counting-on-new-unity-to-challenge-bjp/articleshow/86772237.cms||Manu Aiyappa

Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Manoj Mukund Naravane, who is also the Colonel of the SLIR, signed the charter of affiliation with Air Cmde Tarun Chaudhry, Commodore Commandant, 17 Squadron.  The affiliation of SLIR with Rafale’s 17 Squadron of the Western Air Command will assist them in development of mutual understanding of joint ethos, capability, limitations and core competencies of the other service through common understanding of military tactical doctrines and concepts in the contemporary conflict environment.  General Naravane said this enhanced synergy and understanding of each other’s strength will act as “Force Multiplier within our armed forces”.  No. 17 Squadron Air Force – The Golden Arrows was formed on October 1, 1951, which played important roles in the battle during Goa Liberation Campaign, 1965 India-Pakistan War and 1971 operations. The Golden Arrows was resurrected at Ambala in September 2019, which was its birth place in 1951, and became the first ‘Rafale’ Squadron of IAF.  The Sikh Light Infantry Regiment inherits its ancestry from the Sikh Pioneers, which was raised in 1857. After 75 years of service, the Sikh Pioneers was disbanded in 1932. During World War II, the necessity of a tough and hard hitting infantry was felt and thus Sikh Pioneers was re-raised in October 1941 as Sikh Light Infantry. The SLIR has participated in various operations like World War II, Operation (OP) Vijay, OP Orchid, OP Cactus Lily, OP Blue Star, OP Rakshak, OP Rhino, OP Snow Leopard and others.  The ceremony was also marked by an aerobatics display by the Rafale aircraft. COAS visits Kharga Corps COAS Narvane visited Kharga Corps to review the operational preparedness and laid a wreath at Vijay Smarak in Ambala Cantonment.  At a special ‘Sainik Sammelan’ in Raina Auditorium, the COAS lauded the exemplary zeal displayed by all ranks of the Corps during all operations till date. He also motivated all ranks to rededicate themselves for the highest professional and operational standards set by the Corps.  The Kharga Corps was raised to battle the enemy at Krishnanagar in West Bengal under the leadership of Lt Gen TN Raina.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/armys-sikh-light-infantry-signs-affiliation-with-iafs-17-squadron-in-ambala/articleshow/86762238.cms||JK Singh
---||India||Kheri violence: Union min’s son booked for murder, judicial inquiry ordered||LAKHIMPUR KHERI: A day after eight people were killed in violence during a farm protest in UP's Lakhimpur Kheri, a murder case has been filed against junior Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish Mishra. The minister, too, has been booked for criminal conspiracy. A deadlock between protesting farmers, who refused to cremate the bodies of those who died on Sunday, and the administration was resolved by Monday afternoon after a meeting. The government has promised a judicial inquiry headed by a former high court judge, compensation of Rs 45 lakh each to the kin of the dead and a government job each for the bereaved families. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI, “Eight deaths have been confirmed, including that of a journalist. Cross FIRs have been registered at Tikunia police station (under whose jurisdiction the violence took place on Sunday). One, by farmers’ families against Ajay Mishra for criminal conspiracy and Ashish Mishra for murder, causing death by negligence and criminal conspiracy. The second was lodged by the family of the driver who was killed, against unidentified persons, for rioting.” No arrest was made till the time of filing the report. Bharatiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk, however, disputed the numbers. “Two men were beaten to death by protesters,” he told TOI. “Those people had opened fire on farmers. In self-defence, the farmers took action. They were protesting peacefully. There was no intention to kill anyone.” Prohibitory orders have been in place in the district since Sunday night. Internet services remain suspended. Political representatives who tried to visit the village on Monday could not. They were either detained, stopped or prevented from landing in Lucknow. “Do not allow any political representative to enter Tikunia,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had told farmers, protesters said. BKU chief Naresh Tikait, meanwhile, warned BJP members against visiting villages in the area. “I have appealed not to invite any MP or MLA from BJP in the villages. It is better for these leaders to stay away or they will be responsible for any untoward incident.” Farmers initially refused to cremate the bodies of the dead or send them for autopsies. The bodies lay in four freezers at the protest site. After Tikait got there along with other farmer leaders, talks began with the administration. In a meeting at a school in Banbirpur that began at 5.30am, Tikait, Virk and other farmer leaders raised the farmers’ demands — that Ajay Mishra be sacked, all the accused be arrested, the investigation be wrapped up in 14 days and Rs 1 crore handed out as compensation along with a government job for the families of each who died. On the other side of the meeting were ADG Kumar, DM Arvind Kumar Chaurasia and Kheri SP Vijay Dhull. After several rounds of talks over eight hours, a common ground was arrived at. “A judicial inquiry will be conducted, headed by a retired high court judge who will investigate the violence. The families of those who died will get Rs 45 lakh as compensation and one government job each. Those injured will be given Rs 10 lakh each,” ADG Kumar said. “Anyone who has any evidence should approach the inquiry committee.” After the meeting, Tikait told the farmers they should hand over the bodies — which they did around 2.30pm. A panel of five doctors at the Lakhimpur Kheri district hospital is conducting the autopsies of all who died on Sunday. “It is a moral victory,” Tikait said. “If the government does not do justice and stick to its words, we will launch a protest again.” He has announced a mass meeting on the 13th day of the funerary rituals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kheri-violence-union-mins-son-booked-for-murder-judicial-inquiry-ordered/articleshow/86762159.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Biden would discuss a "path forward, which includes the recognition that this package is going to be smaller than originally proposed".  "What he wants to hear from them is what their priorities are, what their bottom lines are, so he can play a constructive role in moving things forward," she said.  Biden initially proposed a $3.5 trillion social spending bill, but some moderate Democrats are withholding support because of the price tag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-biden-to-hold-meeting-with-progressives-discuss-smaller-bill/articleshow/86762351.cms||---
---||Business||Tensions mount in Washington as US debt ceiling crisis draws near||WASHINGTON: Tensions between Democrats and Republicans ratcheted higher on Monday as the United States federal government had about two weeks to reach a deal on its $28.4 trillion debt ceiling or face severe economic consequences, with Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer urging a vote this week.  "We must get a bill to the president's desk dealing with the debt limit by the end of the week. Period. We do not have the luxury of waiting until October 18," Schumer said in a letter to lawmakers.  Senate Republicans have twice blocked action to raise the debt ceiling saying they do want action but refusing to help, saying Democrats can use a parliamentary manoeuvre known as budget reconciliation to act alone.  Late last month the House of Representatives passed and sent to the Senate a bill to suspend the limit on Treasury borrowing through the end of 2022. Schumer was expected to hold a vote on that measure this week.  Moody's last month warned that a failure to act could cause a nearly 4 per cent decline in economic activity, the loss of almost 6 million jobs, an unemployment rate of close to 9 per cent, a sell-off in stocks that could wipe out $15 trillion in household wealth and a spike in interest rates on mortgages, consumer loans and business debts.  President Joe Biden plans to accuse Republicans of voting directly to let the United States default, according to the White House.  "The president will deliver remarks on the need for Congress to fulfill its shared responsibility and address the debt ceiling, after Senate Republicans voted twice last week to default and continue to block Democratic efforts to avoid default," the White House said ahead of Biden's Monday remarks.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who has said for weeks that his caucus will not vote to raise the limit -- shot back at Biden with a letter accusing leadership of allowing Democrats to "sleepwalk" toward catastrophe, Politico reported.  "Your lieutenants in Congress must understand that you do not want your unified Democratic government to sleepwalk toward an avoidable catastrophe when they have had nearly three months' notice to do their job," Politico reported McConnell as writing.  Treasury secretary Janet Yellen last week warned lawmakers that the nation was close to exhausting its federal borrowing capabilities - now set for October 18.  Schumer said the Senate will have to stay in session through the weekend and possibly into a planned recess next week if no progress is made on raising the debt limit.  Last week, the Senate's parliamentarian ruled that Schumer could use the reconciliation process to bring a debt limit bill to the Senate floor, according to a source familiar with the ruling. This would allow the bill to pass by a simple majority instead of the 60 votes normally needed for most legislation.  According to the parliamentarian, doing so would not jeopardise Democrats' efforts to bring a second bill to the Senate floor under reconciliation. That is the multitrillion-dollar bill embracing Biden's domestic agenda expanding social services and addressing climate change that Democrats are now developing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/tensions-mount-in-washington-as-us-debt-ceiling-crisis-draws-near/articleshow/86762372.cms||---

The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders increased 1.2 per cent in August. Data for July was revised higher to show orders rising 0.7 per cent instead of gaining 0.4 per cent as previously reported. Orders have now increased for four straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 1.0 per cent. Orders shot up 18.0 per cent on a year-on-year basis.  "Factory orders continue to climb, a good sign for manufacturing," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. "However, manufacturing is still being tested by the global supply-chain issues."  Shortages held back shipments of factory goods, which barely registered a 0.1% gain in August after advancing 1.5% in July.  Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding inventories, which were depleted in the first half.  An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed manufacturing activity steadily expanding in September, but noted that "companies and suppliers continue to deal with an unprecedented number of hurdles to meet increasing demand."  According to the survey all industries were "impacted by record-long raw materials lead times, continued shortages of critical materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products."  Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose. Slower GDP growth Input shortages and the resulting high prices, worsened by the latest wave of Covid-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, likely caused a sharp slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter.  Data last Friday showed high inflation sharply cutting into consumer spending in July, with a moderate rebound in August. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP growth braking to a 2.3 per cent annualised rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7 per cent pace in the second quarter.  The increase in factory goods orders in August was led by computers and electronic products, fabricated metal products, transportation as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. But there were decreases in machinery and primary metals orders.  With shipments barely rising, inventories at factories rose 0.6 per cent in August after a similar gain in July. Unfilled orders at factories jumped 1.0 per cent after rising 0.5 per cent in July.  The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, gained 0.6 per cent in August instead of advancing 0.5 per cent as reported last month. Momentum has, however, slowed in recent months.  Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.8 per cent. Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have increased 0.7 per cent in August.  Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth. That contributed to hoisting the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.  "Incorporating data from the factory goods report and other related measures, we continue to believe that real equipment spending fell noticeably in the third quarter and that the real change in business inventories was close to zero that quarter," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/us-factory-orders-gain-steam-as-manufacturing-keeps-humming/articleshow/86762651.cms||---

GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company, has not set terms for its listing yet, but it could seek a valuation of about $25 billion, Reuters first reported in August. The IPO, one of the most hotly anticipated deals of the year, is expected to round out a record year for flotations, after several other big names such as Robinhood Markets Inc, Coinbase Global Inc and Roblox Corp capitalised on the capital markets boom earlier in 2021. Alongside electric-vehicle maker Rivian's stock market debut, GlobalFoundries is expected to headline an unusually crowded year-end IPO schedule, as companies look to make the most of sky-high investor appetite for listings of high-growth tech companies. GlobalFoundries filed for an initial public offering on Monday of up to $1 billion, a placeholder figure that will likely change when terms of the share sale are set. During the pandemic, the broader industry that includes automakers and electronics producers has been crimped by a global shortage of chips, which has fuelled manufacturing delays. GlobalFoundries' revenue had been in decline since 2018, but over the past 12 months its growth rebounded as worldwide demand for chips sky-rocketed. "Although the supply-demand imbalance is expected to improve over the medium-term, the semiconductor industry will require a significant increase in investment to keep up with demand," GlobalFoundries said in the filing. The chipmaker has been consolidating its product lines and announced plans to expand into new factories in the US and Singapore. GlobalFoundries plans to build a second factory near its Malta, New York, headquarters, and spend $1 billion to boost output. The company's net revenue for the six months ended June 30 was $3.04 billion, up nearly 13 per cent from a year earlier. Net loss in the same period narrowed to $301 million, from $534 million a year earlier. GlobalFoundries was created when Mubadala bought Advanced Micro Devices Inc's manufacturing facilities in 2009, and later merged it with Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. The company, which makes radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, automotive, and other specialised semiconductors, counts Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom Inc among its customers. GlobalFoundries was initially targeting a listing in late 2022 or early 2023, but moved up the timetable to capitalise on the current IPO boom, people familiar with the matter said. Takeover targetGlobalFoundries' decision to file for an IPO is a clear sign that it is not eager to accept a potential merger with Intel Corp or other potential buyers during the current chip boom. The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Intel Corp was weighing a buyout of GlobalFoundries. It stopped short of making a formal offer, Reuters reported in August. GlobalFoundries was concerned such a tie-up would upset some of its key customers that are Intel's rivals, Reuters previously reported. GlobalFoundries is the world's third-largest foundry by revenue behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, but ranks second when factoring out Samsung's foundry business that makes chips for other elements of the South Korean firm. The U.S.-based chipmaker, which has invested about $23 billion to build five manufacturing facilities across three continents since the company was started in 2009, has about 10,000 patents, according to its filing. GlobalFoundries plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol "GFS". Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Credit Suisse are the lead underwriters for the IPO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/globalfoundries-reveals-revenue-jump-in-us-ipo-filing-as-chip-demand-surges/articleshow/86762685.cms||---

The apex court said that in case the decision of the Committee is not in favour of the claimant, a clear reason for the same shall be recorded by the Committee which is called a Grievance Redressal Committee. It also said that as per the NDMA Guidelines, the ex-gratia assistance to the families affected by Covid-19 deaths shall continue to be provided for deaths that may occur in future phases of Covid-19 as well. The top court also ordered that the Grievance Redressal Committee can examine medical records of deceased patients and take a call within 30 days and order the compensation. "All endeavours shall be made by the District Disaster Management Authority/District Administration and even the Grievance Redressal Committee to avoid any technicalities and all concerned authority shall act as a helping hand, so as to wipe off the tears of those who have suffered due to loss of a family member died due to Covid-19," the bench said. It had said that ex-gratia assistance will also be given to the kin of those who died of the virus due to involvement in Covid-19 relief operations or activities associated with the preparedness for dealing with the pandemic. "Covid-19 cases, for the purpose of considering the deaths of the deceased due to Covid-19, are those which are diagnosed through a positive RT-PCR/Molecular Tests/RAT or clinically determined through investigations in a hospital/in-patient facility by a treating physician, while admitted in the hospital/in-patient facility; "That the deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of testing or from the date of being clinically determined as a Covid-19 case shall be treated as "Deaths due to Covid-19", even if the death takes place outside the hospital/in-patient facility," the bench said. The government had said that NDMA had issued the guidelines on September 11 in compliance with the directions of the apex court given on June 30 wherein it had directed the authority to recommend guidelines for ex-gratia assistance. In its affidavit filed on a batch of pleas by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal and intervenors represented by advocate Sumeer Sodhi seeking ex-gratia assistance to family members of Covid-19 victims, the Centre had said the NDMA has already started discussions/consultations on the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission regarding insurance intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-state-should-deny-rs-50000-ex-gratia-to-kin-of-those-who-lost-lives-to-covid-19-sc/articleshow/86762677.cms||---

In a study conducted at AIG hospitals, comparing RT-PCR positivity from nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) nasal swabs and saliva, doctors found that in hospitalised patients RT-PCR by NP/OP swabs showed 80% positivity. In patients who tested negative by NP/OP swab, if saliva was tested, the per cent positivity increases to 95%. “Emergence of viral variants that are no longer detectable by certain diagnostic tests is a real possibility due to the fact that the virus is constantly mutating. A negative RT-PCR result does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consider negative RT-PCR result in combination with clinical observations, patient history, lab and radiological investigations and epidemiological information,” said Dr Nageshwar Reddy, chairman, AIG hospitals, after releasing a Covid-19 protocol guideline. Other experts say that of the four main variants of concern, beta and gamma can be sometimes missed. “However, cases can also be missed due to timing of tests, vaccination status of the individual as vaccinated individuals clears the load of the virus much faster compared to others, there is a high possibility of missing out the infection,” said Dr Kiran Madhala, healthcare expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/doctors-seek-new-detection-norms-for-strains-that-beat-rt-pcr/articleshow/86762826.cms||Amrita Didyala

According to the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), the water storage level in the 13 major reservoirs is 780 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet). Last year, it was a bit higher at 807 tmcft. “If one takes the average storage level of the past 10 years — 860 tmcft — then this year’s figure is lower. However, it’s ample,” said an official in the water resources department. Another official shared a similar observation. Water resources minister Govind Karjol is confident there won’t be a problem. “The year’s monsoon has satisfactorily improved the storage levels in dams. There is adequate water to cater to drinking water needs, and there won’t be any issue in fulfilling the water requirements of the agricultural sector and industries,” he said. He added that the majority of water bodies, including lakes, were brimming with rainwater, which had also helped recharge groundwater. Rains were weak in the last week of August and first week of September, but they picked up subsequently, augmenting the inflows into dams. “Though the monsoon has officially ended, there is a forecast of rainfall in the coming weeks, so there is still a window for the storage in reservoirs to improve,” said Manoj Rajan, commissioner, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC). Residents of Bengaluru and Mysuru, which rely on Cauvery for drinking water, can breathe easy. The major reservoirs in the Cauvery basin, including Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS), Hemavathi, Kabini, and Harangi, are near-full. In the Krishna basin, the main reservoirs such as Bhadra, Tungabhadra, Ghataprabha, Malaprabha, Alamatti and Narayanapura also have good levels. Almatti dam, the biggest in the state, has a water level of 517 metres as against the full reservoir level (FRL) of 519 metres. It gets water from Koyna dam and some others in Maharashtra. Similarly, Belagavi district’s Ghataprabha reservoir, which had a major role in worsening the flood situation last year after operators waited for it to be almost full, has a water level of 650 metres currently as against the FRL of 662 metres. Malaprabha dam, also in Belagavi, which was one of the worst-hit last year, has storage up to 628 metres compared to the FRL of 633 metres. Linganamakki, Supa, and Varahi reservoirs (hydel) also have better storage levels than last year’s cumulative storage capacity. Revenue department officials said KSNDMC did well in minimising the damage from flash floods in north Karnataka this year. Mismanagement in the release of water from various dams was one of the main contributing factors for the 2019 deluge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/deficient-monsoon-in-karnataka-but-dam-levels-are-up/articleshow/86772292.cms||Manu Aiyappa

Radha Krishna, who met Pawan Kalyan thrice after the 2019 elections, is yet to take a call on joining the party. Radha Krishna, the son of deceased former MLA and Kapu leader Vangaveeti Mohana Ranga, has a huge following among the Kapu community. Despite his defeat in the 2009 and 2014 general elections, Radha Krishna extended his support to the capital cities protests. Though he joined the TDP before the 2019 elections, he has distanced himself from the party. Supporting the call given by Pawan Kalyan, Radha Krishna asked the Kapu community to play the role of a big brother in uniting SC, ST, minorities and BC castes. “Kapu minister’s comments scolding his own community hurt me. We have the power to teach a lesson to the government and we proved it earlier. No one has the right to scold his own community. It is time for us to unite and work together with the castes which never tasted the fruits of power,” Radha Krishna said. Jana Sena cadre have welcomed his comments and said they hope he would soon join the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-radha-krishna-join-jana-sena/articleshow/86760382.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Business||Insurance: Hero eyes rural push||MUMBAI: The Munjal family’s Hero group plans to take insurance to the hinterland by leveraging the familiarity of its brand, which has been synonymous with two-wheelers. The group’s insurance broking arm has integrated its systems with 35 insurance companies and will sell policies and settle claims seamlessly through IT integration. Hero Insurance Broking India CEO Sanjay Radhakrishnan told TOI that the Hero has a presence in 2,700 locations that is serviced by the company, which is more than the reach of any private insurance company. “If you take out crop and group health, penetration of insurance is concentrated in the top 100-150 cities. Our objective is to be present in centres where insurance companies have not got into,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, the company has built a presence in 525 centres, which will nearly double to 1,000 centres by the end of the year. The company is targeting gross premium income of Rs 10,000 crore in five years, of which Rs 2,500 crore will be generated from sales of insurance in small centres through point-of-sale persons. “The two reasons for farm distress are either crop loss due to weather or other events and health emergencies,” said Radhakrishna. He added that insurance could address both issues. Currently, HIBIL covers two-wheeler, auto insurance, tractors life and health by issuing policies through its tech platforms, which are integrated with the insurance companies. According to Radhakrishnan, it was the focus on digitisation that enabled the company to continue its business without disruption during Covid. “We believe that our phygital model will be key. Although insurance companies have gone digital, the policies still have to be physically sold and explained by someone especially in tier-3 and beyond cities,” said Radhakrishnan. “In a small centre like Katihar in Bihar, we have agents who are doing Rs 7-8 lakh of insurance premium every month,” he said. For most agents, insurance distribution is an additional activity. The company is also hiring business correspondents. “In 2-3 years, we should have 60,000 agents in such small locations,” said Radhakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurance-hero-eyes-rural-push/articleshow/86762233.cms||Mayur Shetty

The incident took place close on the heels of Rs11 lakh looted in Supaul district late Sunday night. Four criminals on two motorbikes intercepted one Bal Mukund Kumar alias Mukund Pathak at gunpoint near Israuli petrol outlet on the busy Maraurha-Chhapra road under Maraurha police station area in Saran and snatched the bag containing money at around 3.15pm when he on his bike was on way to load the cash in different ATMs in the district. Two criminals on a motorbike were following Mukund from the Axis Bank branch at Marhaurha from where he had withdrawn the money to load the cash for which he had got the franchisee from the company. A police team headed by SHO Arvind Kumar rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. The victim, stated to be a resident of Patedhi village in Saran district, later reported the incident to the Marhaurha police station. He revealed to the police that the criminals chased him on their motorbikes for nearly 3kms to commit the crime. Saran SP Santosh Kumar also visited the spot and issued necessary instructions to the investigating officers. An intensive vehicle-checking drive was launched after sealing the borders of the district. “Raids are on to nab the criminals,” the SHO said. Efforts to contact the SP proved futile. An investigating officer said the CCTV footage was being obtained from the shops and business establishments along the exit route of the robbers. The police have, however, failed to ascertain the identity of the gang involved in the crime. On Sunday night, a group of armed miscreants raided the office of a private firm engaged in online marketing in Supaul district and escaped with Rs11 lakh. SHO Vinod Kumar Singh said on Monday that the cash collected from the agents was kept in the office shelf as banks were closed since Saturday. The miscreants also took away the costly mobile phones of the employees. In another incident, a gang of armed criminals barged into a jewellery shop — Vijay Jewellers — located at Salimpur under Ujiyarpur police station area in Samastipur district and decamped with jewellery and some cash.The value of the looted jewellery was yet to be assessed. However, one of the criminals was apprehended by some local residents. He was handed over to the police after being thrashed. The arrested outlaw was identified as Amit Kumar Sah, stated to be a resident of Begusarai district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-40-lakh-looted-in-saran-rs-11-lakh-in-supaul-in-24-hours/articleshow/86760560.cms||Ramashankar

In case of sudden closure of business or service by these players will heavily impact the subscribers,” says Supratim Bandyopadhyay, chairman, The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). The on tap window, which is similar to the RBI rules for new banking entrants, was open earlier for a month from July 1 and 30, 2021. Following which, Tata Asset Management Company and Max Life Insurance Company have recently received a nod from the pension sector regulator for setting up pension fund managers.

Though Congress flexed its muscles to contest from both seats in retaliation to the RJD’s decision not to spare the Kusheshwar Asthan for its ally, the grand old party on Monday failed to announce its candidate for either of the two seats. While interacting with the media after a training session of RJD members, Singh said they needed everyone’s support to defeat the NDA. When told about Congress’s anger, as it had contested from Kusheshwar Asthan in 2020 and lost by a margin of nearly 7000, Singh said his party has respect for all, but when RJD becomes strong, it will help its alliance partners too. On Sunday, RJD named Arun Kumar Sah and Ganesh Bharti as its official candidates from Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, respectively. This development came even though Congress had constituted a five-member team headed by state’s research wing head Anand Madhab to interact with the people and get their feedback before finalising its candidate there. Madhab on Monday told TOI that the Congress has finalised the names for both the seats and sent the message to the RJD office. “We have informed them about our decision. If they do not step back, we will contest from both the seats,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-refuses-to-spare-kusheshwar-asthan-for-congress/articleshow/86760617.cms||Sheezan Nezami

According to Swift, the lack of standards is impeding digitisation. “Truly Effective digitisation can only be achieved when it is rolled out hand-in-hand with standardisation and legal harmonisation, technology on its own is not enough,” Swift said in a white paper on digitising trade. “India is already ahead in retail payments. It has the potential to take a lead role in digitisation of trade. However, every bank appears to be pursuing its own digitisation strategy with some using platforms like blockchain,” said Kiran Shetty, CEO and regional head for Swift in India and south Asia. He added that having a common standard need not hamper innovation. “Just like Banks have been innovating on payments after a common platform like IMPS (immediate payment system) had evolved, they can innovate once there are common standards for trade,” he said. According to an analysis of trade data conducted by Swift, India’s trade transactions (payments made in respect of imports) were up 25% in January-August 2021 compared to a decline of 18% in the same period in 2020. At the same time, Asia-Pacific transactions are up 5% year to date and down 5% in corresponding period last year. These findings are based on an analysis of messages sent using the Swift platform. According to the data, the top three corridors that drove growth during the period were China where transactions grew 42% year-on-year, the US (22%) and Canada (38%). In total transactions, the US has the highest weight accounting for 16% of all transactions followed by China (12%) and Canada (10%). Bulk of the cross-border transactions (69%) fall in the mid-value segments where payments range from $2,500 to $1 million. This segment has seen a 32% growth whereas higher values have grown by only 25% and lower values by 12%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/swift-calls-for-standard-trade-digitisation/articleshow/86762300.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Patna City has so far reported 10 cases, followed by nine in Patliputra and three each in Azimabad, Kankarbagh and New Capital circles. “Two cases were registered in Naubatpur block, whereas one each in Phulwarisharif, Sampatchak, Danapur, Barh, Daniyawa and Bhakhtiyyarpur. A task force team has been sent to these areas for fogging,” she said. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, an epidemiologist at NMCH, said the number of dengue cases has been rising since September-mid as its season begins post-monsoon and stays till the onset of winter, which is November-mid. “In the last one week, four people have tested positive with dengue and admitted to the hospital. Of the total eight patients undergoing treatment here, five are from Patna and one each from Nalanda, Hajipur and Madhubani. As far as the seasonal or viral fever is concerned, the cases have declined compared to the September’s first week,” he said. “Twenty-one children are presently undergoing treatment as many of them have developed pneumonia. So far, 103 patients have been admitted in the paediatric ward since September 1. Most of the patients come for consultations in the OPD,” he added. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur told this newspaper on Monday that three dengue patients were undergoing treatment for dengue. “Most of the patients are having symptoms like high fever, cough, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea. The number of patients coming for consultations in the OPD has slightly declined, but many are still coming with viral influenza symptoms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maximum-16-dengue-patients-in-city-from-bankipore-circle-56-cases-reported-so-far/articleshow/86760619.cms||Faryal Rumi

JMC-Heritage commissioner Avadhesh Meena said, “We will digitise all land record maps. After the process is complete, people can access the photocopies while the originals will be kept securely to prevent further decay of paper.” “We will begin inviting tenders soon,” he said. The entire project will cost over Rs 70 lakh. Experts feel the city needed a new survey and the civic body would have to stretch its budget to accommodate it. In 1948, the Jaipur Maharaja had conducted a property survey of the Walled City registering the length, width and owner’s name of every property. Those maps have not been updated according to the growing population. Maps were created of all 10 ‘Chaukaris’ of the Walled City mentioning every household. These maps are useful even today and they help identify original owners of properties. They are also acceptable in court. The JMC Heritage office has around 66 maps are present for the entire Walled City. However, many of these maps are torn from the sides and in the middle making it difficult for people to locate properties. The government did conduct two surveys after 1948, but later those surveys were cancelled for not being accurate enough. Qasi Kudartullah, a map reader at the corporation, said, "Sometimes, we are able to locate the property by identifying its neighbourhood. In the Walled City, properties are usually sold by identifying the chain of owners to know the original owner of the property to prevent tenants from selling properties. If the documents are not found, the files are lost."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/70-yr-old-city-survey-maps-in-a-shambles-jmc-to-go-digital/articleshow/86762162.cms||---

Till now, the pilgrims had to complete both the formalities to come to the state for the Char Dham yatra. Moreover, as per the latest SOP issued by the Uttarakhand government, the Covid curfew has been extended in the state till October 19. For Char Dham yatra, it mentions that those who have spent 15 days after the double dose of vaccination can get their e-pass and undertake the yatra. However, those pilgrims who have not been administered the first or second dose of vaccination would be required to produce an RT-PCR/TrueNat/CBNAAT/RAT Covid negative report (not before 72 hours of the arrival time). However, as the states of Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh still have a high number of Covid cases, the pilgrims from these three states need to complete 15 days after being administered the second vaccination dose and also produce the RT-PCR negative report at the time of arrival. Meanwhile, the Centre has directed the states to remain alert from November 7, which marks the start of Navratri, to December 31, the last day of the year. “Any laxity in implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour could lead to serious consequences and can result in a surge in cases,” states an official letter from the department of health and family welfare of the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/e-pass-sufficient-for-char-dham-pilgrims-tourists-dont-need-to-enroll-on-smart-city-portal/articleshow/86760573.cms||Kautilya Singh

The order could have implications for the board’s role in the selection of senior management for the insurance industry. The order was in a petition filed by a senior executive of National Insurance Company on the ground that the BBB is not a body competent to make the selections. According to the petition, the BBB is a banking body established under the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980. “The very jurisdiction of BBB to make the selections to PSU general insurance boards is questioned and selection and appointments set aside. In my view, this should equally apply to CMD selections by BBB,” said K K Srinivasan, former member of insurance regulator Irdai. Recently, the BBB had shortlisted candidates for the post of MD in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) as well. The petition also stated that the appointments committee of the Cabinet has no role in appointing an employee of a public sector insurance company on the board as these appointments are made ex-officio. It also stated that the board contains banking experts but none from the insurance sector. In its order, the court said that the BBB should exercise its jurisdiction within the four corners of the Banking Companies Act 1980. “If the BBB could not have undertaken the process of selection of GM/directors in public sector insurers, then the selection by BBB would not conform with the law,” the order said. It added that the process of selection must be undertaken in terms of the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of each public sector insurer, through the circulars already issued or validly framed rules relating to the criteria and composition of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-sets-aside-insurer-appointments-by-bbb/articleshow/86762309.cms||Mayur Shetty

Yadav was arrested in the case from Patna on May 11 this year. The additional district and sessions judge-III, Nishikant Thakur, who is also in-charge of MLA/MP special court, pronounced the verdict in the presence of Yadav, who was escorted to Madhepura from Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) where he was admitted for treatment. Yadav's counsel Manoj Kumar Ambastha said his client will be released from judicial custody after completing the legal formalities. Earlier, while deposing before the court, the victims admitted that the case was lodged against Yadav under confusion. “We were never kidnapped, as was claimed in the FIR,” a senior lawyer quoted the victims as saying. As per the prosecution, Yadav was charged with holding Umakant Yadav and Ram Kumar Yadav captive following a dispute over the marriage of a girl in Madhepura. He was also accused of intimidating them to withdraw the case lodged with Murliganj police station on January 29, 1989. One Shailendra Yadav, stated to be the cousin of Ram Kumar, had lodged the case with Murliganj police station in Madhepura district against Yadav, who was known to them. A compromise petition was also filed by the victims in the court, paving the way for his early release. On July 19, a Patna court had granted him bail in connection with a case related to holding dharna and processions in the state capital. The agitation was launched by JAP in support of the farmers' protest against the farm bills. Earlier, the Patna high court had directed the MP/MLA special court to dispose of the case within six months. “I have full faith in the judicial system. I have been absolved of the charges by the honourable court,” a jubilant Yadav told reporters outside the Madhepura court. Back to his political stand on various issues, he said the Uttar Pradesh incident in which eight people were killed would boomerang on the ruling alliance at the Centre. “It is not an ordinary incident. It is a manifestation of the country’s democratic set-up crumbling down. Be it the case of farmers or youths, there is oppression all around,” he said and warned of its dire consequences in days to come. Meanwhile, rumour mills were agog over Yadav contesting the byelection from Tarapur assembly constituency in Munger district as JAP state president Raghvendra Singh Kushwaha had hinted at the party’s move on Sunday. JAP sources didn’t rule out the possibility of JAP merger with Congress in days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pappu-yadav-acquitted-in-32-year-old-kidnapping-case/articleshow/86760651.cms||Ramashankar

The joint director of the Gangetic Plains Regional Centre, Gopal Sharma, told this newspaper that the state had already been celebrating Wildlife Week from October 2 to 8 by organizing various public awareness programmes for people, especially children, so that “they do not harm animals”. “Climate change impacts both humans and animals. In the name of development, we are destroying the habitats of wild animals by making roads and cutting forests,” he said. Satyajeet Kumar, the director of Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, pointed out that October 4 was celebrated as International Zookeeper Day because “they take care of all the inmates”. “Various programmes of their interest, including boat race, tug of war, quiz, and community lunch were organized,” he added. Talking about the Patna zoo, Satyajeet said, “There are more than 1,100 animals belonging to 90 species here.” D K Paul, a member of People for Animals (a welfare organization), pointed out that this year’s theme for World Animal Day was ‘Forests and Livelihoods: Sustaining People and Planet’. “We should take necessary steps for conserving our natural resources like forests and water bodies as well as the environment for safeguarding the lives of animals and humans,” he said. Paul also observed that there was an urgent need to effectively implement the laws made for the protection of animals. He added, “Our children should be educated to have respect for animals and treat them with kindness and love. Food and shelter should be provided to stray animals by the government and the NGOs to ensure their safety.” He also suggested a complete ban on dissection of animals in scientific studies and research. The head of the zoology department in Patna University, Arbind Kumar, said, “Since the United Nations has already declared 2021-2030 as the ‘ecosystem restoration decade’, we must strive hard for saving the biodiversity from being degraded and protecting the lives of all living creatures, including plants and animals. Besides, we should be kind to all animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/treat-animals-with-kindness-and-love/articleshow/86760688.cms||B K Mishra

The former minister had promised to take care of the education expenses of a student from Puttur in 2017. Divith has secured an engineering seat at a private college in Mangaluru, after which the former KPCC chief agreed to take care of his fees. He has also discussed this with the institute. When Divith was in Class VII at Harady Government Model Upper Primary School in Puttur taluk of Dakshina Kannada district, he had approached Parameshwara, then home minister, to save four teachers from his school from being transferred. He had sent a text message to bail out the teachers. The minister then took up the issue with then education minister Tanveer Sait and revoked the transfers. “Ever since, my son has been in touch with the former minister. When he was selected for World Scout Jamboree in Japan, the minister sponsored Rs 1 lakh. Since he secured a free seat for PU, we did not ask for any help. He scored 84% in PU exams. The moment his engineering course seat was confirmed, my son dropped a message to the Congress leader. He asked us to meet him at Tumakuru, and I did it with my younger son Pavith (Class 10 student) on September 30. He enquired them about their health, studies and discussed general topics,” said Prathima, Divith’s mother and a trainer at Abdul Nazeer Saab State Institute of Rural Development. Divith’s father Uday Kumar is a contract employee at Mescom. Divith aspires to crack UPSC exams. The Congress leader has promised to extend financial support to the boy till he completes his education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/parameshwara-sponsors-students-engineering-fee/articleshow/86761419.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Top electric two-wheeler companies like Hero, Okinawa and Ampere are already seeing a 25-30% ‘festival surge’ as urban buyers opt for electric vehicles due to high fuel prices and affordability due to subsidies. Auto analysts said petrol two-wheelers are suffering because they are dependent on rural markets, which are still recovering from the pandemic. In the top 10 cities both EVs and ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles have grown as people opt for personal transport, but the top 10 cities are less than one-tenth of ICE sales while they are nearly 30% of EV sales. “The electric two-wheeler space has observed 20% growth in the last six months due to increased awareness, government subsidies, and better infrastructure,” said Hero Electric MD Naveen Munjal. With the festive season around the corner, Hero Electric, he said, which sells an average of 10,000 units per month, is expecting a 25-30% rise in sales. Okinawa Autotech has already seen a 30% increase in demand in October compared to last month, founder & MD Jeetender Sharma said. Ampere, the electric two-wheeler arm of Greaves Cotton, has clocked its best sales this year in August and September. In contrast, petrol two-wheeler sales were down 16% year-on-year in September with stocks at 45-60-day high. Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj and Royal Enfield sales were down 26%, 11% and 44% year-on-year, respectively. Auto analysts say the ICE slump has been a rural sentiment hiccup. One look at the top 10 city sales graph for petrol and electric two wheelers tell the story. According to JATO Dynamics, top 10 two-wheeler markets (Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Lucknow, Jaipur, Kolkata, Kochi and Gurugram) saw petrol two-wheeler sales increase just under 7% in the January-September period to 7,94,383 units in 2021 from 7,44,191 units in 2020. In contrast, electric two-wheeler sales jumped fourfold from 5,401 units to 21,850 units in the same period. “With relentless increase in petrol prices, total cost of operation for e-two wheelers is becoming favourable. Government subsidies have helped. Companies like Ola and Ather have fanned interest with their attractive pricing,” said JATO president Ravi Bhatia. The demand surge has prompted e-two-wheeler companies to talk ramp up. “We are scaling up manufacturing and by the end of this fiscal year, we intend to double our capacity,” said Okinawa’s Sharma. The surge is sharp in markets like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat, he added. With the Ola and Ampere factories bringing in serious scale into the business, the electric two-wheeler market is expected to expand substantially. Last month, Ola claimed that it had clocked sales worth Rs 1,100 crore in a two-day window. “ICE two-wheelers are facing the brunt of the second wave’s economic impact because of their scale. EVs are less rural dependent too,” added Sohinder Singh Gill, director general, Society of Electric Vehicle Manufacturers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-scooters-ride-on-festive-demand/articleshow/86761151.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The inauguration will be conducted online from Rishikesh AIIMS as part of the launch of over 160 oxygen plants across the country. The oxygen plant of 500 LPM (Litres Per Minute) capacity at GMSH-16 played a crucial role in meeting oxygen shortage during the second Covid wave. A senior UT official said although the plant had been functional for the past several months, its official inauguration was pending. He added that Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and others will also inaugurate oxygen plants at PGI, GMCH-32 and Sector 48 hospital. The UT health department recently submitted an action plan to tackle the situation in the face of a possible third wave of Covid-19. According to the report, UT administration has upgraded medical infrastructure, including oxygen, to deal with an estimated peak active cases of around 10,000. The report says that the UT health department has availability of 53.8MT medical oxygen against peak requirement of 49.5MT. UT administration is also pushing for installation of oxygen plants in private hospitals. Recently, the health department held a meeting with private hospitals to set up oxygen generation plants in their hospitals on priority. A presentation on Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) oxygen technology was delivered by Dr Manjit Singh, medical officer, GMSH-16, about working of oxygen plants and tentative cost for different sizes of PSA plants. To tackle a likely spread of infection among children, Government Multi-specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, has decided to set up a 32-bed dedicated paediatric ICU centre. The Sector-16 hospital already has 20-bed ICU facility for kids. It has eight ventilators and 12 beds with oxygen facility at the hospital’s surgical ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pm-modi-to-virtually-inaugurate-gmsh-16-oxygen-plant-on-oct-7/articleshow/86761315.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This surge in new customer acquisition is much higher than the last three months. With the festive season kicking in, lenders expect disbursement to double in the next two months. ZestMoney’s CEO & co-founder Lizzie Chapman said, “We expect this to be a (festive) dhamaka festive season and the signs are already visible. In September alone, we had 50% more new customers sign up and transact with us.” There is an increase in interest from retailers wanting to enable BNPL at their stores. BNPL offers at physical stores doubled in September, with new customer applications rising by 10X over the last three months, Chapman said. Besides metro cities, tier-2 and 3 markets have recorded three times more demand compared to metros. “As for consumer demand, we expect TVs and smartphones to be one of the largest categories followed by home appliances, online fashion, home decor etc. Demand for electric vehicles is also high and we are expecting to double our electric two-wheeler business next month,” she said. Most borrowers come from the age category of 22-36 years. With a month-on-month customer growth for new loans at a healthy 35%, fintech lender CASHe anticipates the next few months to witness higher demand for products led by the BNPL offering. Its CEO Yogi Sadana said,“We have approved over 40,000 loans in September which has been its best month of the year so far. Around 70% of the demand is currently from metros. However, new customer acquisition from tier-2 & 3 cities is rapidly increasing.” LenDenClub saw the average ticket size of BNPL loans increase from Rs 9,500 in July to Rs 13,000 in September. Its co-founder and CEO Bhavin Patel said, “We have disbursed about 3.5 lakh loans given till now, of which 80% of loans are completely closed or repaid. We have received over 1.60 lakh applications in September month, of which 18%-20% from new customers, higher august growth 10%-15%.” Capital Float’s co-founder & MD Gaurav Hinduja said they saw a 30% increase in new customer acquisition in September. “We find the number of new customers signing up for BNPL very encouraging.

There is a clear direction from AICC leadership not to have any alliance with AIMIM. While there were no details, Akbaruddin and leaders close to Revanth told TOI it was a courtesy call as the latter had come to submit a representation to speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy for allotment in MLA quarters under MPs quota. But sources did not rule out the possibility of two having discussed politics. “We had coffee. Nothing much,” Akbar said, adding that Revanth enquired about his health as they had met after a long time. Sources said Revanth had to be in a Nampally court in the note-for-vote case, but dropped by the assembly as there was still some time for the hearing. CBI must probe HMDA site hacking: RevanthTargeting the TRS government over the hacking of HMDA website, Revanth tweeted: “In the wake of my recent complaint to the CBI over crores of rupees scam in the Kokapet land auction, the hacking of HMDA website has raised suspicion on internal involvement. We demand the Union home ministry order CBI enquiry immediately (sic).” Congress floor leader Bhatti Vikramarka too raised the issue in the assembly and urged the speaker to allow a short discussion on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-akbar-meetcreates-political-buzz/articleshow/86775245.cms||---

In a memorandum submitted to the vice-chancellor (VC), the aggrieved students pointed out that CNLU was the only university to conduct term-end examinations in physical mode. All other national law universities would conduct online exam. The students apprehend that the offline examination may infect them with Covid-19 as many candidates will come from states like Kerala and Maharashtra where the pandemic is yet to be fully controlled.

The byelection is scheduled on October 30 in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies in the state. The counting of votes will be held on November 2, meaning thereby that the proposed meeting would be held after that. To a question, the CM said he would take into account all the existing rules and regulations before reaching any decision on the issue. “I have complete faith that all political parties in the state would reach a consensus on the issue,” Nitish said while reiterating his demand for holding caste-wise enumeration of population during the Census-2021. Nitish further said a delegation of 10 political parties from Bihar had met PM Narendra Modi (on August 23) and explained to him everything in favour of holding a caste-based census across the country. “During our meeting with the PM, We demanded that caste-based census must be held across the country. Now, it is up to the Centre to think over our demand and take a decision,” Nitish said. The long-pending demand was revived in July this year after the Union government informed in the Lok Sabha that it would not enumerate the population caste-wise, except those from the SCs and STs. Replying to a written query in the Lok Sabha on July 20 this year, Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai (who hails from Bihar) said the government of India has decided as a matter of policy not to enumerate caste-wise population other than SCs and STs in the Census 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-all-party-meeting-on-caste-census-after-assembly-byelection/articleshow/86760587.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Vijayawada||In Andhra Pradesh, ‘tradition’ in bypolls hinges on political climate||AMARAVATI: The sudden retreat of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) from the Badvel by-election fray citing ‘honouring the tradition,’ has kicked up a debate in the political circles as the practice is conveniently followed by the arch rivals TDP and YSRC only when it suited their political agenda. Both the parties have broken the tradition when they wanted to show their might. They left the field open to the rivals when they wanted to score some brownie points with the general public while escaping a defeat.  Very recently, Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency faced a by-election following the death of then sitting MP Balli Durga Prasada Rao of YSRC. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy nominated Rao’s son Kalyan Chankravarthi to the legislative council and fielded young medical professional Dr P Gurumurthy for the bypoll. TDP jumped into the battlefield with renewed energy stating that YSRC had not fielded a member of the deceased MP’s family. TDP hotly contested the election as it was held almost two years after YS Jagan Mohan Reddy came to power and it wanted to turn the tables on Jagan by winning the Tirupati LS seat.  TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu pulled all his energies as the constituency was located in his home district. Naidu, his son Lokesh and several senior leaders aggressively campaigned in the constituency. Interestingly, BJP too took the election as a prestige issue as its national president JP Nadda had addressed a public gathering there. The saffron brigade wanted to emerge as the principal opposition. However, their strategies did not yield result as YSRC grabbed the seat with a majority of over 2.4 lakh votes against TDP candidate Panabaka Lakshmi. BJP candidate Rathna Prabha lost the deposit. Similarly, Nadyal assembly went to bypoll following the death of then sitting MLA Bhuma Nagireddy in 2017. It was a tricky political situation as Nagireddy got elected on YSRC symbol in 2014 and joined TDP in 2016. Contending the seat belonged to it, YSRC asked TDP to stay out of the race. However, TDP advised YSRC to keep out of the fray as it was fielding Nagireddy’s nephew Bramhananda Reddy in the by-election. Allegedly miffed over Naidu luring his legislators, Jagan went ahead with fielding his nominee in the bypoll. In fact, Jagan wanted to win the election to push Naidu into corner ahead of the 2019 general elections. Sensing trouble, Chandrababu Naidu moved heaven and earth and bagged the seat in a fiercely contested battle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-ap-tradition-in-bypolls-hinges-on-political-climate/articleshow/86760217.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Srei’s failure to get investor sealed fate||MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: The repeated failure of the Srei management to induct an investor for over a year as well as the findings of the RBI’s special audit has prompted the regulator to supersede the boards of two group companies and send them for insolvency action. Describing it as “pre-emptive” action, sources told TOI that the RBI decided to initiate the move as some of the banks had also approached sharing their concerns, with the DHFL resolution — the first action against a financial services outfit under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) — providing it additional comfort to initiate the move. Banks have an exposure of over Rs 30,000 crore and are keen to ensure that they are not impacted by problems at the Kolkata-headquartered entities. Srei said that it was shocked by the move as banks were already in control of cash flows and have been appropriating funds from an escrow account. They had also not heard about the insolvency action from the banks. The company has been trying to strike a deal with lenders for a stand-still agreement which would give it more time to repay. Since problems surfaced in the non-banking finance companies space nearly two years ago, following the collapse of IL&FS and DHFL, the RBI has been keeping close tabs on the health of the top 100 outfits and working with some of them to resolve their governance and other issues. During this exercise, Srei had emerged as a prominent NBFC, which was facing stress, prompting the regulator to initiate a dialogue with the management. While Srei had been promising to rope in investors, it repeatedly failed to find a candidate, with officials seeing it as nothing more than delaying tactics. “No serious proposal was on the table to provide comfort to the RBI,” said a source. What complicated matters were the findings of a special audit and supervisory assessment carried by a team from the RBI, which pointed to alleged evergreening of loans with some related-party transactions seen to be areas of concerns. “There have been discussions on the issue for several months and the RBI wanted to act on it in a non-disruptive manner,” said a source. Official sources said that the problems at Srei are unlikely to cause any systemic ripples given that the market now finds comfort in the IBC framework for financial services companies after the recent resolution of DHFL. In any case, the RBI’s assessment of the NBFC space has suggested that the situation is not alarming and there may be stray cases of pressure, which is more than manageable. “We had submitted a proposal to pay the full amount to banks under a scheme filed under Section 230 of the Companies Act 2013 in October 2020. However, they have neither accepted the scheme nor proposed a payment schedule acceptable to them. We are also surprised because the NCLT order for all creditors is still in process. There is also an order for “no coercive measures” by the creditors and/or regulators. We will take all necessary steps as advised by our lawyers in this regard,” said a Srei spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sreis-failure-to-get-investor-sealed-fate/articleshow/86762369.cms||Mayur Shetty

The state government told the high court that written orders were given to all district educational officers and regional joint directors not to exert any kind of pressure on educational institutions that are not willing to surrender. The government pleader for education, Raghuveer, told the high court that the scheme introduced by the state government was only voluntary. He said the grant-in-aid to these institutions will be continued as usual. A fresh batch of petitions has been filed before the high court challenging the ordinance brought in by the state government to take over the staff and properties of private aided educational institutions and the consequential GOs issued. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Sudhir Jonnalagadda said the government’s decision will be detrimental to the existence of the aided institutions, some of which have more than 100 years of history. He said the situation was created by the government through not providing sufficient staff for decades. Taking into account arguments on both sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninanala Jayasurya directed the state government to file detailed counters in all petitions. The high court further directed the government not to take any coercive steps against the institutions in the meantime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dont-exert-pressure-on-aided-edu-bodies/articleshow/86760369.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Vijay Vahini Durga Puja Samiti in Anandpuri, for instance, is preparing a pandal which will look similar to Kedarnath Temple. Santosh Kumar, a member of the samiti, told this newspaper on Monday that the streets were being decorated with rainbow-coloured ribbons and colourful lights. “This year we have decided to install idols of Goddess Durga presenting a crown to a doctor, Saraswati crowning a policeman, and Lakshmi giving a crown to a sanitation worker,” he said, adding that a special arrangement for vaccinating people would also be made at the pandal. Explaining the significance of the three idols, Santosh pointed out, “We will pay respect to doctors, policemen, and all other frontline workers, who worked tirelessly during the Covid-19 pandemic.” The Vijay Vahini Durga Puja Samiti will also put up banners asking people to wear masks, maintain distance, and use sanitisers. Ravi Shankar, the convenor of the Puja Samiti Nayagaon in Patna City, said the streets would be decked up with colourful flowers. “Flowers represent new beginnings. Hence, we will use both artificial flowers brought from New Delhi and real ones from Kolkata and Bengaluru for decorating the pandal,” he added. The pandal will have six idols of Goddess Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Tulsi, Lord Kartikeya, and Ganesha. Five priests will come to Patna from Varanasi for the prayer service from October 7 to 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/get-covid-vaccine-shots-at-this-pandal-on-durga-puja/articleshow/86760563.cms||Faryal Rumi

The hospital, however, has denied the allegations.Sources in the Delhi government said the show-cause notice was issued after the hospital’s replies to their questions were not found satisfactory. DGHS invoked Clause 14.1 of the schedule appended to Rule 14 of Delhi Nursing Homes Registration (Amendment) Rules, 2011.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital officials said, “The allegations in the notice are not true. The hospital authorities are replying to the issues raised and hope the misunderstanding, if any, would be resolved soon.”Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Karol Bagh Vishesh Ravi claimed that he had been pursuing this matter with DGHS for years. He claimed that the gross violations included non-admission of EWS patients even when 95% of the 68 beds reserved for them were lying vacant.“The hospital should not look down upon any EWS category patient and the issuance of show-cause notice to it should act as a deterrent for the other private hospitals in the city who show discrimination in the treatment of EWS patients,” added Ravi.The MLA said Supreme Court had clearly stated that private hospitals who got land at concessional rates were bound to give free treatment to EWS category patients. He alleged that the hospital had shown dereliction of its responsibility towards EWS patients by not complying with DGHS guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ganga-ram-hosp-gets-notice-for-violation-of-ews-norms/articleshow/86761318.cms||---

JD(U), an NDA ally, has fielded its candidates from both the seats. While Chandan will campaign in Tarapur assembly constituency in Munger, Prince will seek votes for the NDA nominee from Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga. “I will try to do justice with the responsibility given to me by the party in the bypoll. I am a true ‘sipahi’ (soldier) of the party. It’s my privilege that the top leadership of the party selected me for the new assignment,” said Nawada MP Chandan, who along with Paras and three other LJP MPs had staged a coup against Jamui MP Chirag Paswan to split the party. Earlier, Paras clarified that he along with the other party functionaries would also campaign in favour of the NDA candidates in both the constituencies. “Since I have a busy schedule for being a member of the PM Narendra Modi cabinet, I will not be able to spare much time. But I will definitely take part in the election campaign. That’s why we have asked our two MPs to work for the NDA nominees with immediate effect,” he told this newspaper over phone. On Saturday, the Election Commission barred both the factions of LJP, one led by Chirag and another by his uncle Paras, from using the name and election symbol of the party in the bypolls. The poll panel, in its interim order, asked both to choose the names and symbols, which may be allotted to the candidates set up, if any, by the respective groups. The poll panel’s order came at a time when the process of filing nomination papers is underway. LJP founded by former union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan split in June this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/paras-deputes-2-mps-to-support-nda-nominees/articleshow/86760631.cms||Ramashankar

But due to global warming, the Arabian Sea is also getting active again, said former head of the department of oceanography and meteorology, Andhra University, Prof OSRU Bhanu Kumar. In an interview to TOI on changing weather patterns, Dr Bhanu Kumar said the Arabian Sea has been warming faster to generate frequent storms. “A severe cyclone formed in the Arabian Sea this May apart from several recent weather systems. It was a rare phenomenon to see the remnants of Cyclone Gulab from Bay of Bengal making its way to the Arabian Sea to develop into a cyclone again,” said Dr Bhanu Kumar. The noted meteorologist said the absence of El Nino in the Pacific Ocean, neutral indices of the Atlantic Ocean and positive dipole mode index in the Indian Ocean helped in getting good monsoon rains this year. “It is an unusual phenomenon in recent years to witness good monsoon rains for three consecutive years. Even the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon is delayed this year by about a month. The withdrawal generally commences around September 1. This year, the departure is yet to start. If you take the data from the last 10 years, there were hardly an average one to two depressions or other systems a year. We have 11-12 systems this year as if there was a revival of old monsoon patterns. The monsoon activity is consistently varying from year to year. As timely monsoons are crucial to our agrarian economy, the erratic patterns are affecting all,” said Dr Bhanu Kumar. “The sharp rise in sea surface temperatures and rising sea levels will be a threat to the coastal areas in the future. Mangrove forests like Sundarbans are an example of how the increasing sea levels could devour the coastal areas. It is affecting several parts of the globe. Coal is a huge contributor to carbon dioxide emissions and consequently to global warming. Methane is another primary contributor to climate change. The performance of monsoons is directly linked with the sea surface temperatures and climate change. It is our collective responsibility to work out an action plan to slow or stop global warming. The green cover should be increased and we should opt for renewable energy sources instead of depleting fossil fuels. Otherwise, we may continue to witness more extreme, unpredictable rainfall events in the future,” said Dr Bhanu Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/warming-arabian-sea-stirring-up-frequent-storms/articleshow/86760423.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

It will be for students who wish to join the armed forces. Their physical fitness, personality development and mental development will also be taken care of. For the first time this year, an Army recruitment rally will also be organised at Bawana Stadium. The government also launched an initiative for the children studying in their schools who dream of becoming officers in the Army via UPSC, where military officers, IAS, IPS officers will share their experiences related to studies and preparation with the children through direct interaction. In the fourth session of this series, on Monday, Colonel Rajesh Gupta, an alumnus of Delhi government school and an officer of the Indian Army, shared his experiences with the students. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia presided over the interaction, which was moderated by director education, Udit Prakash. In the interaction organised at SKV No.1 Shakti Nagar, in addition to direct interaction with around 75 children of different schools, around 13,000 children also joined this programme through YouTube Live. “I loved the Army uniform and did not want to do a desk job. Both these dreams of mine were fulfilled by joining the Indian Army. After passing Class X examination, I decided to join the Indian Army through NDA. Nothing is easy in life but nothing is difficult to achieve if you are determined. All you need is passion and hard work, so one should always dream big and set big goals for oneself. Control your fear and make the best use of your abilities,” said Gupta.

---||Patna||Fuel prices hit all-time high in Patna, sales dip by 20%||PATNA: Fuel prices hit an all-time high in Patna as petrol was sold at Rs 105.36/litre and diesel at Rs97.31/litre on Monday. Experts say the rates are likely to increase further due to rising prices of crude oil in international market. The rising fuel prices have adversely affected the middle and lower income groups, which have already been hit hard due to Covid pandemic. Petrol and diesel prices in Patna have been hiked by Rs1.20 and Rs1.40/litre, respectively, in the last 5 days, bringing the sales down by 20%, said Ashok Kumar, proprietor of a fuel station near Dak Bungalow crossing here. The oil companies have revised the petrol and diesel prices for four consecutive days since September 30. “We are expecting the prices to increase further, as the international rates of crude oil may rise. About 20% sales have already been affected,” Ashok said. After a fall of 24 paise per litre in petrol rates in August, there has been an increase of 45 paise per litre in September and 60 paise in October so far. Diesel prices, after declining by 74 paise per litre, increased by Rs1.40/litre in September and 70 paise in October. Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at the Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance, Patna, told the newspaper that this time the fuel prices are increasing because of rise in international crude oil rates. “It has gone up from $73 per barrel on September 20 to $80 per barrel on October 4. It is expected to cross $90 per barrel in the coming days. Therefore, we will see further increase in the petrol and diesel prices in the coming days. Efforts are on to shift from petroleum to ethanol blending and increased use of electric vehicles. But this change will take some time. Till then, cost of transportation is going to be high,” Sudhanshu said. Economist DM Diwakar, however, said if the government failed to follow the economic fundamentals, the chances of revival of the economy would decline. “In such a case, there are limited options for the government for resource generation; that is why the fuel prices are increasing. The government has no other means to cover up the loses as well as to generate funds to run its programmes,” he said. “It is a lame excuse to increase the fuel prices based on speculations. When the prices fell, why did not the government reduce the rates? If they want to change the prices based on international rates of crude oil, then they should let the market decide,” he added. The fuel prices have a cascading effect on other commodities, especially household and kitchen essentials like grocery items, cooking oil, vegetables and fruits, among others. Many families are struggling to grapple with multiple issues, including cash flow and rise in commodity prices. Auto driver Ranjeet Kumar said he earns only Rs100 to 120 per day, which is not enough even to fulfil the basic needs of his family. “Many of my friends left this profession, as the prices of diesel have been increasing at a rapid pace. The prices of LPG and essential commodities have also increased,” he said. Kadamkuan resident Shweta Kumari (39) said monthly budgets have been hit hard by the rising fuel prices. “Unprecedented increase in the prices of LPG cylinders and edible oil has further squeezed the household budgets, especially when the festival season is round the corner. We have kept some savings for medical emergency, by cutting our expenses,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fuel-prices-hit-all-time-high-in-patna-sales-dip-by-20/articleshow/86760537.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||IT cos to post 12%-15% YoY growth in Sept quarter||Chennai: Indian IT continues its growth trajectory and top tier IT companies are expected to post strong revenue growth in the range of around 12%-15% year-on-year (YoY) and 5%-7% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the July-September quarter. This is despite the fact that July-September will be the first quarter in recent times that does not come with the benefit of ‘low-base’ for the sector. While strong uptick in IT spending by clients, increase in large deals and pent-up demand helped revenue zoom in the period, analysts said margins will likely be down or flat on a sequential basis due to rising staff costs and increased fresher and lateral hiring. Increased attrition rates is also expected to be a key theme across major IT service providers in the quarter with talent acquisition and retention efforts adding to cost pressure. “We forecast exceptionally strong revenue growth in the September 2021 quarter with the ‘slowest’ growing company clocking 4.7% QoQ growth,” Kawaljeet Saluja and Sathishkumar S, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, said. The same quarter last year (July-September 2020) were characterized by multiple benefits such as deferment of wage revision, reduction in travel costs and pull back in discretionary spending, but companies have rolled out wage increases twice since December 2020, which is likely to cause a dip in margins YoY, they added. Cross-currency movements (appreciation of USD against GBP, EUR and AUD) are expected to bring average 20-90 basis points headwinds on sequential basis in the quarter. “In the September quarter, we expect the tier 1 Indian IT service providers (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL) to continue on the positive growth momentum they started showing in June quarter,” Prashant Shukla, vice president, Everest Group, said. “This would be driven by significant demand bounce back across key industries; even the directly-impacted industries like travel & hospitality are showing signs of recovery.” Analysts at Emkay Global observe a strong secular demand and expect Infosys to raise its FY22 revenue growth guidance to 15%-17% (constant currency basis) YoY compared to current guidance at 14%-16%. “HCL Tech is likely to retain its double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY22, and Wipro is expected to guide for 2%-4% constant currency QoQ revenue growth for the Oct-Dec quarter,” they said. While velocity of large-sized deals has likely reduced from the previous quarter, the sector is seeing high velocity of mid-sized deals and small digital transformation programs. Kotak also expects top tier IT companies including Infosys, TCS, Wipro and others to increase their revenue guidance for FY 2022 with a strong digital transformation focus across sectors. The intake of deals, digital business growth and attrition levels will be key monitoring parameter to watch out for as companies announce their results for the quarter. The demand environment in the BFSI, manufacturing, and recovering retail sector will also determine the full year revenue outlook, analysts added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/it-cos-to-post-12-15-yoy-growth-in-sept-quarter/articleshow/86761069.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Reinsurance giant Munich Re has come out with new terms for supporting the reinsurance programs of life insurance companies. According to industry sources, Munich Re has also proposed to hike its rates by as much as 50%. Reinsurance rates are one of the inputs for determining the insurance rates on term policies. The increase would not get fully reflected in term insurance premium as only a portion of the risk is reinsured. Besides reinsurance rates, Indian insurers price policies based on the industry’s experience in respect of mortality. In its September 18 edition, TOI had reported that the German reinsurer had asked companies to tighten the process ahead of a review of its contract in October. The company has now officially communicated its intent to hike rates and specified the new process for underwriting. “Insurers have been pricing their term policies on the back of reinsurance support. Even with the increase in rates, the premiums are lower than what the rates would have been if they were based on mortality rates for the general insured population. Companies have been pricing high-value policies aggressively with the expectation that the experience in this category would be better than the general segment,” said Abhay Tewari, MD & CEO, Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance. He added that as insurers expand, their mortality experience tends towards the mortality rates for the general population. Moreover, the Rs 1-crore policy, which was considered high value a decade ago, is now very common. “An individual starting his career should have at least 20 times annual income. So a youngster earning say Rs 6 lakh per annum would require a cover of over Rs 1 crore,” said Tewari. The increase in reinsurance rates could have implications for the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), which has a premium of Rs 330 for a sum insured of Rs 2 lakh. According to insurers, the premium would need to be increased to at least Rs 450. Also, the Rs 40 commission paid to banks for selling the policies could be cut for renewals. Insurance companies have been doing their financial underwriting using substitutes such as credit scores but Munich Re has said that credit scores will not be acceptable. The reinsurer had already tightened medical underwriting requirements in the wake of the pandemic and now more proposals are being subject to pre-medical. Also, companies have put in place a cooling period for those who have recovered from Covid. One private insurer has capped the sum insured for Covid survivors at Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/munich-re-tightens-term-insurance-underwriting/articleshow/86762181.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Delhi||Illegal operation: N corpn re-seals shopping complex||New Delhi: Barely two weeks after a mall in Karol Bagh was sealed again by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and a police complaint lodged for the illegal breaking of the seal, another such case has come to light.An official confirmed that a shopping complex in WEA Block was in operation despite the building’s basement having been sealed in 2012 as its construction was illegal. As soon as the issue came to light, the corporation re-sealed the property last week.Another property next to this complex was found operational despite orders being issued to vacate and demolish the structure a few years ago. “We issued the sealing order in 2012 and demolition order in 2016 because the building plan of the entire complex was not approved, including the basement, ground, first, second and third floors,” said an official.Such incidents that have come to light in the past 15 days have raised questions over the efficacy of the civic body’s actions. The corporation, however, claimed that police had to ascertain if norms were being violated after sealing was carried out.Facing flak after the first such incident, the corporation announced that it would carry out a survey of properties where the seal was broken or tampered with. It expected to detect 10-15 such commercial properties.Leader of the House Chhail Bihari Goswami said they had initiated an inquiry into the matter. “We ordered an inquiry immediately after getting to know about the illegal operation of the sealed complexes. We have filed complaints with police and approached the court to get the defaulters prosecuted. We will ensure that the guilty get punished,” he added.After the first complex was resealed on September 20, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the BJP-led civic body’s leaders had taken crores as bribes from the mall owners.Raising questions over the civic body’s sealing action, AAP councillor and leader of Opposition Vikas Goel alleged that the entire exercise was just a way “to make money”. “Not just Karol Bagh, such violations are happening across Delhi with the connivance of the civic body and local police,” claimed Goel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/illegal-operation-n-corpn-re-seals-shopping-complex/articleshow/86761330.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Business||Sebi looks to split high networth investor part of IPO||MUMBAI: In an attempt to ensure mid-sized investors do not get pushed out of public offers by very large investors, markets regulator Sebi on Monday proposed to segregate the high networth investor (HNI) portion in initial public offers (IPOs) into two parts. Under the first sub-category within the overall HNI segment, only those investors who submit applications of between Rs 2-10 lakh will be allowed. Those investors who want to put in applications of more than Rs 10 lakh will be clubbed into the second sub-category. Sebi has come out with a discussion paper on these proposals and have asked the public to offer their suggestions by October 20. Under the current system, anyone who wants to invest more than Rs 2 lakh falls in the HNI category during the bidding process in IPOs. Applications of up to Rs 2 lakh are considered to be from retail investors. Sebi feels very large applications also can create some extra risk for the market and hence the proposed changes. Sebi also proposed that a third of the HNI portion in all IPOs should be reserved for investors belonging to the first sub-category, that is applications of between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The balance two-third part within the HNI category will be for applications of above Rs 10 lakh. Sebi also proposed that a minimum price difference of 5% should be set between the lower and the upper bands in an IPO. This means that in every IPO at the upper end, the price should be at least 5% more than the floor price. Currently there are no such bands. There have been IPOs in which the difference between the upper price and the lower (floor) price of the band has been as low as just Re 1. Sebi feels such narrow price difference defeats the purpose of bidding and makes IPOs as fixed price ones where the company and merchant bankers actually set the price instead of the investors applying in the offer. Currently Sebi allows fixed price and book building methods in IPOs. Every book-building IPO should have a price band in which investors will be allowed to bid for the prices at which they want to buy the shares. Current rules also say that at the upper end of the band, the price should not be more than 20% of the lower price. The discussion paper was published after detailed deliberations by the markets regulator’s Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC). “The objective of fair and transparent price discovery mechanism in a book-built issue appears to have been diluted over time due to evolving market practices,” the paper noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/sebi-looks-to-split-hni-part-of-ipo/articleshow/86762336.cms||---

Significantly, AAP’s remarkable vote share had opposite effects on the prospects of the BJP and Congress. While it reduced the Congress’s tally to just two seats in the GMC, it catapulted the BJP’s seats to 41. The Congress’ vote share, which was an impressive 46.93% in 2016, fell by a massive 18.96 percentage points to 27.97% this time. AAP’s vote share in its maiden entry in Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation election was 21.3%, directly cutting the vote share of Congress and smaller parties. In at least four wards, AAP panels bagged more votes than Congress candidates. These were Mahatma Mandir, Ambapur-Sargasan, Kudasan and Koba. In three other wards, three AAP candidates had more votes than the Congress candidates. In Koba, the four AAP candidates got over 16,000 votes while the Congress candidates got only 6,069 votes. One Congress candidate in the ward got only 900 votes. A BJP leader said the party increased its tally from 16 to 41 despite a marginal 1.73% increase in vote share. The leader said that with opposition votes divided between Congress and AAP, the BJP bagged many seats. “The triangular contest between BJP, Congress and AAP ensured that BJP was the sole gainer in terms of seats,” the leader said. AAP leader Isudan Gadhvi said, “Our vote share of 22% was impressive given that we campaigned only for 15 days. The people of Gandhinagar wanted change, but we failed to ensure that turnout was high. The people wanted a change from BJP and Congress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aap-gets-just-one-seat-but-carves-out-21-of-votes/articleshow/86792781.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The decision has been made after the wooden bridge, built by Pathans from Peshawar over 150 years ago as one of the routes for reaching Tibet from India, was defaced by some miscreants last month. The bridge, which comes under the purview of the Gangotri National Park (GNP), opened for tourists on August 23 after a gap of 60 years. But in early September, it was found that some of the visitors had scribbled their names on the sheesham railing of the 136-metre-long bridge. Videos had also emerged of youngsters standing on the edge of the bridge and performing stunts. In order to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, officials of the district administration and GNP said that it was decided to install CCTV cameras on the structure. "On the suggestion of district magistrate of Uttarkashi, Mayur Dixit, we have decided to install eight CCTV cameras in Gartang Gali. Public Works Department (PWD) has been assigned the task on a budget of around Rs. 10 lakh", said R N Pandey, deputy director of GNP. He added that the cameras will be monitored from an outpost being set up at Lanka Pul near Bhairon ghati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cctv-cameras-at-gartang-gali-soon-to-keep-an-eye-on-miscreants/articleshow/86760591.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

For this, we have eminent people as honorary mentors. Under their guidance, the scientists and students are inspired and get ideas,” said Prof Anantha Ramakrishna, director of CSIO. “We are in the process of getting more people on board for the same,” he added. Also, to have diversity in research and collaboration, the research committee is chaired by Dr Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises. The other members include vice-chancellors, top DRDO scientists and engineers. For instance, during Covid-19 pandemic, CSIO in collaboration with other institutes developed UV disinfectant system for HVAC ducts, which has wide applications for disinfecting mechanically ventilated indoor spaces with a view to prevent the spread of Covid like viruses, fungi, mold and bacteria. There is also a plan to flatten the landscape where hierarchy will not remain a roadblock in development of any technology. “Previously, scientists used to depend on the heads for taking up projects. Now, independence is granted to them now. Also, in case a prototype developed is not being scaled up by any manufacturer within a time period, the same is aborted so that resources are not wasted,” said a scientist at the CSIO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/csio-steps-up-initiatives-to-diversify-research/articleshow/86761349.cms||Shimona Kanwar

SVC SP Rosie Kalita said, “We have issued summons to 124 candidates, who had allegedly been involved in the scam. We have started interrogating around 10 to 15 of them every day and have initiated the investigation today.” On September 30, Kalita had quizzed a professor, Dilip Borah, and Gauhati University registrar Hemanta Nath in connection with the case. The SVC team also interrogated APDCL officials Daisim Hazarika and Sanjay Bhowmik. “Investigation is underway. We will make arrests if we find adequate evidence against those whom we are interrogating,” Kalita added. So far, 11 people, including prime accused Mohammed Ataur Rahman, have been arrested in connection with the case. Rahman is the chief general manager of APDCL. All of them are currently in judicial custody. Kalita said many APDCL officials are under scanner. The alleged scam pertains to recruitment exams held on February 17 and April 28 in 2019 for the posts of office-cum-field assistant, sahayak and light vehicle drivers. A racket was allegedly involved in demanding bribes ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh from candidates to clear the written examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/svc-questions-15-candidates-in-apdcl-recruitment-exam-scam/articleshow/86770604.cms||Mukut Das
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: One family has been ‘ruling’ this Ramnad panchayat for 28 years||MADURAI: In its agrarian setting, M Karisalkulam panchayat appears like any other in Ramanathapuram district. There is a difference though. This panchayat has scant regard for the democratic process. And, few, if none, have challenged this audacious violation of the Panchayati Raj system. The by-election to choose the new panchayat president for M Karisalkulam is slated for October 9. But S Vilvasanthi, 34, has been already elected unopposed. The story goes a long way, in fact 28 years to be exact. The panchayat has been electing its council, from president, vice-president to ward members, unopposed for the past 28 years. That too, from the same family. Dominated by the maravars, a sub-sect of the thevar community (MBC), with a minor representation of the vellalar and yadava communities, this local body has been ‘choosing’ its president from the same family right from the inception of the Panchayati Raj system. When the local body election is announced, the villagers get into a huddle at the local Vilva Viswanathan, Vanapetchiamman or Nondi Karuppasamy temples for a meeting. The elders decide who would represent them in the next council. It is a unanimous decision to elect the council, including the six ward members. The chosen members file their nominations and at the end of the scrutiny, they are declared elected. Pandi Thevar of M Karisalkulam was elected panchayat president in 1996, when the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act came into force. This panchayat has three villages, M Kariselkulam, M Thaniankottam, and M Usilankulam. There are a total of 825 voters in the three villages. M Karisalkulam has 280 houses, M Thanian Kootam 150 and the smallest M Usilankulam about 50 houses. When the term of Pandi Thevar ended, his relative Kalimuthu was elected president. Uthravalli, daughter of Pandi Thevar was elected president in 1999, and Kalimuthu’s daughter Sandhanamari in 2014. Karuppasamy, son of Pandi Thevar, was elected panchayat president in the local body elections in 2019. When he fell ill in October 2020, the seat fell vacant and he died subsequently. So, his sister Vilvasanthi has now been elected unopposed in the by-election. “Such practices make a mockery of the democratic process which aims at making women and dalits and all sections of the society leaders,” said Dr G Palanithurai, former professor in the department of political science and development administration, Gandhigram Rural Institute and Deemed University in Dindigul district. President elect, Vilvasanthi said she would endeavour to do her best for the people of her panchayat as it was her duty. “We are here to do our best for the people, and I will do it with the help of the panchayat council and the support of my husband,” she said. “Such practices of choosing panchayat presidents is something that cannot be checked by legal means,” said Palanithurai, a Panchayat Raj expert. “This is prevalent in many villages, where a dominant caste topples or destroys the democratic process by design. The State Election Commission may be helpless, but political parties can stop it,” he said. There is a lack of political will though and the villagers don’t complain either. They are accessories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/one-family-has-been-ruling-this-ramnad-panchayat-for-28-yrs/articleshow/86762163.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

It is the responsibility of the government that any child who is progressing in the field of higher education should not stop his studies due to lack of money,” said Sisodia. Sisodia appealed to the beneficiaries to become “Desh ke Mentor” and help children of Delhi government schools who have talent but need guidance to give direction to their talent.  Under the scheme, 100% financial assistance is given to the children of ration card-holding families. Students whose annual family income is less than Rs 2.5 lakh receive 50% financial assistance. Students whose annual family income is more than Rs 2.5 lakh but less than Rs 6 lakh receive financial assistance of 25%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-gives-rs-48cr-aid-to-nearly-7k-students/articleshow/86762164.cms||---

Tourists will soon be able to avail the taxi helicopter service. Haryana tourism department officials said that on September 29, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar visited Morni in helicopter during the launch of aero and adventure sports facilities. Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta accompanied him during the single engine helicopter ride, with a capacity of six. The helicopter started the ride from a private hotel in Sector 3 and reached Tikkar Tal in Morni in 10 minutes. By road, it usually takes about one and a half hours to reach Tikkar Tal. The private taxi service will cost around Rs 3,000 for a 10-minutes ride. While the private helicopter taxi operating firm has received permission from the DC, permission from the aviation ministry is yet to be received. Private firm officials said that they have two helicopters, single and double engine, both of which are stationed in Noida. They will be brought here when the facility is launched. The private helicopter firm also plans to offer a separate helicopter ride with hotel room tariff package and another package of hotel room with lunch and dinner facility. Aero and water adventure sports initiated by Haryana Tourism at Tikkar Tal includes parasailing, paramotor and jet scooter. While inaugurating it, the CM said the department would train local youth in adventure activities, which would not only generate employment opportunities but would also give a major boost to the state government’s efforts to develop tourism in Morni hills. The CM has also launched home stay and farm stay policies to promote Haryanvi culture. These policies are aimed at giving tourists an opportunity to stay with local families instead of hotels and experience the native culture and cuisine. A list of revamped farm houses was also shared for tourists.

Many were sitting on the benches after a gap of 13 to 18 months. The maximum buzz was in government, zilla parishad schools while a majority of the private schools decided to reopen in the second half of the month. Students queued up eagerly at the gates for temperature and oximeter checks. The four-hour session was mainly spent interacting with teachers and friends and sharing their thoughts about the education system. Some students narrated the loss of a near one and there were a few moments of emotional bonding, but many were happy to get back to school for a new beginning. At Manorama Memorial English Medium School in Kedgaon, in Daund, in Pune’s rural areas, the school started for Std V to X. The entire school was sanitized and the surroundings were cleaned and consent forms were collected from the parents and each student was checked with a thermal gun. Principal Sujata Hiwale said, “There was a general assembly with social distancing. Covid rules were explained in detail. The students were welcomed with music and applause. They sat one on each bench. They seemed happy and excited to come to school, meet their friends and teachers. The teachers were also enthusiastic to hold offline classes. On the first day, we had around 55% students present. We hope to see it reach 100% soon.” At the Rajiv Gandhi Academy of E-Learning, the school started at 8.30am and students were given a flower each after doing the mandatory temperature checks. Director of SCERT Devendra Pal Singh visited the school. He was heartened by the enthusiasm of the students. Singh said the day was like a celebration of admission. Commissioner of education Vishal Solanki also visited the school and went to every classroom. Solanki interacted with the students and popped a few puzzles to them. Many schools in the city had decorated the premises with flowers and balloons to welcome the students. At the civic school in Yerawada, students entered the gates with a bright smile as their teachers greeted them with a rose each. Students settled in the class on alternate benches. Class teacher Dilip Kate, while interacting with the students, said that the task would be challenging now to shift back to offline learning. He told the students that they would start slowly and initially do some revision of the concepts taught in the first half of the year. “We will not be in a hurry for any exams so all of you can take it easy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/its-meet-greet-as-in-person-classes-begin/articleshow/86761371.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||Pune: Ward offices to look for other vaccination sites||PUNE: Vaccination sites in civic body-run secondary schools will shift to alternative sites in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation areas. Instructions have sent to the ward officers to look for other places with the required infrastructure. As per the daily vaccination report released by the PMC and the PCMC, more than 100 vaccination sites are being used as the Covid vaccination sites for the past few months. A teacher at the Annasaheb Magar secondary school in Pimple Saudagar said that they have written to the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to move the vaccination site. When contacted, Suryakant Devkar, chief immunisation officer in PMC, told TOI that most vaccination sites operating are in primary schools. Since they have yet to reopen, they will continue to operate the sites, however, the ones, which are in secondary school premises, will be shifted. “We have told corporators and ward officers to look for alternative venues with the required infrastructure to host vaccination centres,” he said. Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner of PCMC, said, “We are aware of the current condition and the instructions have been passed on to look for the alternative sites.” According to PMC officials, the civic body had permitted vaccination centres in schools after local corporators demanded it. “These centres were started to increase the number of vaccination sites and ultimately the total number of vaccinated citizens. Civic schools in areas, which had less number of vaccination centres and high demand, were selected for makeshift vaccination centres,” a senior PMC official said. Meanwhile, on Monday until 6pm, around 61,470 beneficiaries got their shots across 700 government and private vaccination sites in the district. The Kartavya Social Foundation gave 15,000 free jabs to citizens. The drive was conducted at Late Malati Kanchi Nursing Home (Gadikhana). The drive was organised by senior vice-president of Pune youth Congress Saurabh Amrale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ward-offices-to-look-for-other-vax-sites/articleshow/86761381.cms||Piyush Bhusari

With the court issuing notice to the CBI investigating the death case of Swami Narendra Giri, clouds of uncertainty loom over the ceremony scheduled for October 5 to anoint his disciple Balbir Giri as the math's next chief, sources said. The notice was issued to the investigating agency after hearing the petition filed by Swami Madan Mohan Giri, a Niranjani Akhara seer at the math. The court's hearing in the case will continue on Tuesday. When contacted, Niranjani Akhara secretary Swami Ravindra Puri said he had "no knowledge of the notice or the petition". He, however, admitted that there were "murmurs from sadhus of the decision to anoint Balbir Giri, mainly due to the fact that he did not belong to the Girinama branch of seers." About the ceremony on Tuesday, he said, "It will be held as scheduled. All preparations have been made and seers have reached to take part in it." He added "the court's order, if any, in the case will be respected." The decision to appoint Balbir Giri as Narendra Giri's successor and anoint him on October 5 was announced by Niranjani Akhara acharya mahamandaleshwar Swami Kailashanand Giri on September 30 following consultations with the akhara seers both at Prayagraj and Haridwar for two days.

The cell had received information about the two shooters coming to Dwarka More to commit some crime. Cops laid a trap and arrested the duo after an informer identified them. During interrogation, accused Abhishek revealed that he and his associates had fired upon a man who turned out to be a gangster, Priyavrat, linked to Lawrence Bishnoi and Kala Jathedi. To save themselves, they joined the Pradhan gang and started committing crimes on his instructions. Last year, he had allegedly bumped off one Shakti, a cousin of gangster Neeraj Bawana on Pradhan’s instructions in Jhajjar.

The number of hospitals administering Sputnik in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits has gone up to eight because of better stock against three in July. Hospitals administering Sputnik said its supply eased in August, but the demand for the first dose had fallen significantly. Dr Anant Kulkarni, deputy medical superintendent, Shatayu Hospital, Hinjewadi, said, “About three-four months ago, there was a shortage of Sputnik. We placed an order a few months ago but we couldn’t get it. The supply has eased now and the company (Dr Reddy’s) recently supplied us three lots of first doses —each containing 1,200 first doses — and two lots of 1,200 each second doses, besides ice-lined refrigerators.”  “A bulk of district’s 18-44 population — the age group that showed high demand for Sputnik — took other vaccines as the first dose when Sputnik was in short supply. They cannot take Sputnik now because the second dose will have to be of the same vaccine. Hence, Sputnik’s demand for has fallen, with some centres reporting only three-four beneficiaries a day during weekdays,” he said. Hospitals said unused Sputnik doses would be diverted to corporate tie-ups as the citizens’ demands had fallen. Dr Bhagyashri Pujari, in-charge, admin, New Life Child Care Clinic & Hospital, said, “We got Sputnik stocks in August. We have so far got only first doses.” Dr Pujari said the demand for Sputnik was high in July. “Now, several hospitals started administering it, which is why the demand has fallen significantly,” she said. Dr Madhav Chavan, managing director, Phoenix Hospital, said, “Earlier, Sputnik first doses given per day at the hospital were 300-plus, which have now dropped to 30-40 .” Abrarali Dalal, CEO, Sahyadri Hospitals, said the Sputnik V doses supply was now stable. “About 2,000 first doses and 350 second doses are available in Sahyadri across Pune, Nashik and Karad.

---||Pune||Maharashtra focuses on ramping up test infrastructure in Ahmednagar district||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said the state government would now focus on improving the Covid-19 testing facilities in Ahmednagar district because of its high weekly positivity rate of 4.3% and samples would be dispatched to government laboratories in Pune, Nashik and Aurangabad districts. He said currently the focus of the state government was on Ahmednagar because there was an overall decline in Covid cases in other districts. “As of now, we are seeing an increase in cases mainly from Ahmednagar. There is a decline in other districts. Nearly 17 districts recorded less than 100 daily cases though we are not reducing testing,” Tope told TOI. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday had told the divisional commissioner of Nashik as well as the Ahmednagar collector, RB Bhosale, to focus on testing during the weekly Covid review meeting held in Pune. The testing in Ahmednagar district has been scaled up to 25,000 daily. Over 1,000 samples were being dispatched to Pune district for testing from Monday, said Bhosale, the Ahmednagar collector. “Our weekly and daily positivity rate continues to be below 5%, but we are increasing testing,” said Bhosale. Sources in the health department stated that districts with few government laboratories would soon have tie-ups with private laboratories to scale up testing. A target of two lakh daily tests has been set by the public health department ahead of Navratri and Diwali. State additional chief secretary health Dr Pradeep Vyas had last month issued a detailed directive to ensure that the testing figures did not slide. He had observed in his note that the testing in most districts had dipped. According to the data available with TOI, nearly 13 districts were conducting just about 5,000 tests in a week because of lack of available infrastructure. “Districts such as Akola, Amravati, Dhule, Bhandara, Buldhana and Gadchiroli registered low testing last week too,” said a public health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-focuses-on-ramping-up-test-infra-in-anagar-district/articleshow/86761390.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kanpur||IIT-K and ICCT study suggest adoption of EVs to improve air quality, health benefits in every state by 2040||Done/ALVI Times news network Kanpur: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) with robust power plant emission controls and power sector decarbonisation policies will yield net air quality and health benefits in every state in India by 2040. The study carried out by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur) and the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates vehicle and power sector emissions, air quality, premature mortality, and avoided health damages in India under an ambitious EV sales scenario between 2020 and 2040, with and without robust power sector emission control and decarbonisation strategies. *The findings for 2030 and 2040 suggest that stricter emission control strategies tend to be more effective at avoiding premature deaths than ambitious decarbonisation strategies apart from various benefits. Combining the two strategies maximizes the benefits of EVs and brings improved air quality in every Indian state in 2040 compared to the baseline in 2040. This results in as many as 70,380 avoided premature deaths, equivalent to avoided health costs of up to $80.7 billion (2020 U.S. dollars) in 2040 alone. “This study is a clear indication that EVs are the future and are here to stay and the benefits of its usage can lead to a better quality of life by 2040. We at IIT are proud to be associated with a landmark research and would like to thank ICCT for this wonderful and path breaking collaboration.” said Prof Abhay Karandikar, director IIT-Kanpur. “EVs are the future, but we must be careful about the transition phase and source of energy for charging the EVs. Our simulations on air quality show stringent emission controls at power plants and their decarbonisation in a phased manner is the way forward,” said Mukesh Sharma, professor at IIT-Kanpur and co-author of the study “Indisputably, there are benefits from decarbonizing the electricity grid and improving power plant emission controls, and we see those policies are valuable irrespective of the level of vehicle electrification,” said ICCT India Lead Anup Bandivadekar. “The idea that electrification without cleaning up the grid would backfire in terms of air quality is largely untrue. These findings highlight the societal benefits of EVs, and they can be maximized not by delaying electrification, but when policies for power sector emission control and decarbonisation are implemented in parallel with vehicle electrification strategies.” said Arijit Sen, an associate researcher at ICCT and the study's lead author The study takes the national and gridded emissions output data from various vehicle and power sector scenarios to generate national and state level air quality values using the WRF-Chem model, particularly focused on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration. In 2030 and 2040, there are PM2.5 concentration decreases for all scenarios, which indicates improved air quality nationally. At the state level, barring a slight worsening in air quality in Ladakh that is within model error tolerance, air quality improves or is steady for all states in all 2030 and 2040 scenarios compared to baseline of the same year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-and-icct-study-suggest-adoption-of-evs-to-improve-air-quality-health-benefits-in-every-state-by-2040/articleshow/86761393.cms||---
---||Dehradun||HC to hear Yatra plea today||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Monday agreed to hear the state government’s plea seeking modification of its earlier order where it limited the number of pilgrims to the shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. The plea was mentioned before the Bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma by the government on Monday and the bench listed the case for further hearing on Tuesday. The court is likely to pass its orders on the issue on the same day. The state government had approached the HC last week arguing that since September 18, when the shrines had been opened to pilgrims, no Covid case had been reported. Besides, with only a month-and-a-half left for the Yatra to conclude, the HC should do away with the limit on pilgrims to each of the shrines or extend the limit to at least 3,000 a day to Kedarnath and Badrinath, 1,000 for Yamunotri and 700 for Gangotri. The modification plea was moved as a large number of pilgrims at the shrines were turned away once the sanctioned limit was reached. Locals and traders had also made similar demands, saying due to the limited number of mandatory e-passes being issued, people were wary of travelling as hundreds had been turned away. The police and district administration of Rudraprayag informed TOI that nearly 4,000 people had been turned away from Kedarnath in the last fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-to-hear-yatra-plea-today/articleshow/86760622.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Kanpur||UP: 3 junior scientists in soup for fake RT-PCR reports in Jalaun||JHANSI: Three molecular biologists-cum-junior scientists, including two women working on ad-hoc basis in the microbiology lab in Government Medical College in Orai, Jalaun, have landed in soup for faking a number of RTPCR test results by deliberately showing them positive when they were negative. So far, 15 reports have been discovered from the college. Giving details, principal, Medical College, Dr D Nath told TOI that during routine observations it was found that while cases at rest of the places were declining, here they were proportionally increasing. When the matter was discussed with the administration, along with DM Jalaun Priyanka Niranjan, it was decided that the reports should be cross-checked. As a result, all the samples were then simultaneously sent to Jhansi Medical College, King George’s Medical College (KGMU) and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Lucknow, where the samples turned out to be negative. Taking the matter seriously, the administration has recommended appropriate departmental action. The three junior scientists have been identified as Neha Tiwari, Sachin Ranjan and Priyanka Singh. The report also alleges that the trio, in order to cover up the matter, went to local media with false claims in an attempt to mislead everyone. “On the basis of recommendations given by HOD Microbiology Lab Dr Gopal, and consulting DM Jalaun and CMO, I have sent details to my seniors recommending stern action. Meanwhile, we are initiating departmental action here at the college level,” said Dr Nath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/3-junior-scientists-in-soup-for-fake-rt-pcr-reports-in-jalaun/articleshow/86761403.cms||---
---||Pune||No vaccination site redness among ZyCoV-D trial participants in Pune||PUNE: Some of the common side-effects of the Covid vaccine — redness or soreness at the site of vaccination and low-grade fever/fatigue within 24 to 48 hours post-immunization — were not observed in the advanced trials of ZyCoV-D vaccine among adolescents in Pune. None of the 47 adolescents receiving the three-dose needle-free intra-dermal vaccine at Dr D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital as a part of the countrywide trials complained of these commonly seen side-effects, trial researchers told TOI ahead of the ZyCoV-D’s nationwide rollout this month. Dr D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital, and Bharati Medical College and Hospital in Pune were among the 50 trial sites in India where a total of 1,600 adolescents in the 12-17 years age bracket had participated. While Bharati Medical College and Hospital carried out the trial in eight adolescents from Pune, Dr D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital carried it out in 47 adolescents mainly residing in Baner, Balewadi, Vimannagar, Wadgaonsheri, Pimpri, Chinchwad, Nigadi and rural parts of Pune. The ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the first vaccine in the country that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) for being administered to people aged 12 years and above. Zydus Cadila, in association with the Nashik-based HCG Manavata Cancer Centre, also performed clinical trials of the vaccine on 300 adolescents in the 12-17 years age group in Nashik city. A company official said the trials were successful and there had been no reports of adverse effects. D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital’s trial research consultant Shalaka Agarkhedkar said, “Typically, a small amount of pain or redness is expected with an intramuscular (IM) vaccine having a needle. But this common vaccination site complaint was not at all reported even by a single adolescent trial participant at our trial site in Pune. ZyCoV-D is a needle-free vaccine given just below the skin and not deep into the muscles with a specially designed jet injector. Few adolescents reported only a slight pinching sensation while receiving the shot.” A subcutaneous shot is one into the fatty tissues just beneath the skin. These injections are shallower than those injected into muscle tissues. As for ZyCoV-D, the needle-free intradermal vaccine is a shallow or superficial injection into the dermis, located between the epidermis and the hypodermis. This route was relatively rare compared to injections into the subcutaneous tissue or muscle, resulting in zero pain or redness/soreness at the site of the injection, Agarkhedkar said. Besides, none of the adolescents in Pune complained of fever, fatigue or any other flu-like symptoms hours or days after receiving the ZyCoV-D shot. “Some of the commonly seen side-effects post-vaccination like fever, fatigue and other flu-like symptoms were not at all observed in the trial adolescents who received three doses of ZyCoV-D 28 days apart,” Agarkhedkar said. The trial enrolment of adolescents began in early March and the last trial participant received the last (third) dose on September 23 this year. The adolescents are from different socio-economic strata. Some of the families have an annual income of Rs2 lakh and a few have an annual income of Rs 70 lakh. The trial researchers reached out to these families through the trial participants and hospital’s patients’ database.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-vaccination-site-redness-among-zycov-d-trial-participants-in-pune/articleshow/86761395.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Six of the victims, who have been duped of Rs38.90 lakh, filed a complaint with the police. “The suspects issued us fake appointment letters. They even organised a 45-day-long training session at a Ranchi institute in Jharkhand,” Mayur Kasbe (34) of Malavli in Maval taluka, who is among the complainants, said. Kasbe said he came in contact with the main suspect in 2019. “The man had then introduced himself as a section engineer with the railways. He even showed me his identity card,” Kasbe said. He said when he approached the man, he offered him a job as a TTE and took Rs6lakh from him. “My brother, too, gave him money for the job,” Kasbe said. He said after the first lockdown, the suspects told him to come to Ranchi for training.  “We were among over 20 people, from Maval and Pimpri Chinchwad, who went for the training. After the 45-day long training, we were sent appointment letters. We did not suspect anything as the letter was supposedly sent from an official email address,” Kasbe said. After that there was hardly any communication from them. “When we started pursuing them, the kingpin of the gang called us to the Jasidih Railway Station in Jharkhand in August,” Kasbe said. “While the trio was talking to us about the job profile, officers from the Railway Police Force (RPF) spotted us. One of the suspects showed them his identity card, which ultimately turned out to be fake. The RPF personnel detained him and six of us, too. The kingpin and his accomplice fled from the spot,” Kasbe said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/13-booked-for-cheating-over-20-railway-jobseekers/articleshow/86761409.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The Airport police later arrested 12 people, including women, from either groups following cross-complaints relating to rioting, molestation, causing hurt and abusing, among other charges. Senior inspector Bharat Jadhav of the Airport police on Monday told TOI, “We have registered two complaints of rioting, read with molestation charges, against the two groups of persons from the housing society”. According to police, the incident occurred around 9.30pm when a woman (24) took her pet dog out for a stroll on the society premises and a group of residents confronted her. A society resident told TOI, “We had cautioned all the residents, who own dogs, to clean the poop if they are taking their pets out for a stroll on the society premises. We had also asked the residents to have a discussion if they want to raise the issue instead of fighting or arguing among themselves”. The police said they had registered two cases. A 55-year-old man lodged a complaint claiming that seven-eight members of the housing society kicked and punched him after he confronted the woman dog owner. They also kicked and punched his wife and three-four local residents, the complaint stated. The police arrested seven local residents on the basis of the complaint. Similarly, the woman dog owner lodged a complaint with the police stating that five local residents confronted her after she took out her pet for a stroll on the society premises.

Gaikwad, in a tweet on Monday, said, “Have called for a report on this matter. Appropriate action will be taken.” The incident was reported to the district education officer. An education officer said that many parents have not been able to pay the fees for various reasons such as loss of job and salary cuts. “No school has any right to stop the child’s education. If the event is true, then action will be taken against the school,” he said. A letter from the Yuva Sena to the Maharashtra education department sought a helpline to address these issues. Lapesh Yadav of the Yuva Sena said, “There are incidents reported from some schools that students were made to wait at the gate for not paying fees. The students and their parents had to face embarrassment and mental stress because of this.” “Action must be taken against such schools immediately and we demand that a government helpline be set up to address this problem,” Yadav added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/school-sends-back-pupil-over-fees-under-fire/articleshow/86761416.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Talking to TOI, vice-chancellor, BU, Prof JV Vaishampayan said that a committee comprising two persons from university and two from administration has been constituted to look into the matter in details after which further decision will be taken. The students said that since the final year results were evaluated on basis of the previous year exams in which they were promoted without any examination due to the Covid pandemic, they will be considered failed in the previous year exams as well. District magistrate Jhansi Andra Vamsi and SSP Shivhari Meena had to intervene to calm the agitating students and assured that their problems will be heard and amicable solution will be provided. Ironically, university authorities were missing during the negotiation. The girl students present in a large number said that they were paying for the technical mistakes of the university. According to sources, the university faced some technical snags during checking of the OMR sheets, which affected the results. The students further alleged that earlier they were informed about theoretical exams which were later converted into MCQs-based exams and two exams were held in a day. “In the last moment the decision of holding a theatrical exam was changed to MCQs with two exams in a day which led to total chaos. Later on we came to know that there were technical snags during checking of the answer sheets too”, said one of the protesting girl, a student of BSc IInd year. “This is a very serious issue which should be taken up on the priority basis as there have been many instances where the result of students were first shown as pass and after a few days, they were declared as fail. It is a matter of future of hundreds of students. What if someone commits suicide, who will be held responsible?”, questioned Prashant Gupta, a BCom second year student from Banda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bu-students-protest-against-mismanagement-during-exams-leading-to-mass-scale-failures/articleshow/86761411.cms||---
---||Pune||After months, rickshaw drivers see hope as schools reopen in Pune||PUNE: Autorickshaw driver Salauddin Shaikh has been praying for schools to reopen in the city so that he can go back to picking up and dropping students. But, even though schools have resumed in-person classes from Monday, he has not been called to resume duty by even one of his clients from before the pandemic. “I would pick up and drop students full time. But for a year and a half, since schools shut and online classes started, I was driving in the city catering to regular customers. When I did not receive any calls from parents, I reached out to them myself. They said they would consider hiring me back after accessing the situation for another week or so,” he said. Ayaz Kawde, who also provides a school rickshaw service, said, “Most students I would pick up and drop were from junior classes. Since classes have started only for senior students, we have not been called back. If they resume for Std V onwards, we will be able to get back some business even though we will have to cut down on the number of students we take in the vehicle to just two at a time.” Mohammed Yusuf, another school rickshaw driver, said, “We have already been following all safety precautions such as putting up a partition between the driver and passenger area, sanitising the seats before every ride, and so on. We will also tell the students to wear masks on the ride. Though we will have to decrease the number of students to two, we can increase the number of trips.” He is hoabout resuming services in the next few weeks. For many parents, safety concerns and skepticism over sending their children to school, there are hardly any takers. Priyanka Khase, parent of a std X student, said, “There is a lot of uncertainty about schools staying open, so we don’t want to hire the school rickshaw service just yet.” Anil Trivedi, another parent, said,”Today I dropped my son to school to assess the situation, but he came back home on his own in a rickshaw. The same auto driver has been picking up and dropping him from school since he was in Std II till the schools shut before the pandemic. But now he says that he has outgrown the rickshaw service and wants to commute independently.” Shafiq Patel, Pune City president, Maharashtra Rickshaw Panchayat, said, “About 15% of the rickshaw drivers in Pune would earn an income by providing school pick up and drop service, but have had it tough as they had to switch to earning through regular fares. But even then the condition is miserable with expenses and dues piling up as they cannot cover it with their current income.” With schools reopening, there will be more people with a reason to commute and some of them who do not have their own vehicles or do not want to travel by bus, will take rickshaws, thus bringing about at least some increase in business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/after-months-rickshaw-drivers-see-hope/articleshow/86761408.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

A spate of sexual offences against minors were reported in the state in recent times. NGO representatives said each child must know of the helpline numbers and other available avenues where they can call to report problems. Vaishali Tribhuvan, assistant commissioner of child welfare department and superintendent of the Government Observation, Special and Children’s Home for Girls, said, “Sex education must start right from Class I. Both boys and girls should be made aware of good touch and bad touch from a very young age. We need awareness and open talks about this important subject.” Rama Sarode, advocate and a socio-legal consultant with experience in women and child welfare laws, said it was crucial that children know their rights and responsibilities. “It will help them grow up as better and responsible individuals because it is during the childhood that our belief system and our moral code are formed and cor education is needed if we need a better society tomorrow,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ngos-for-sex-education-from-primary-classes/articleshow/86761412.cms||Ardhra Nair

He said the price drop would take place as panels become more efficient and new materials come into play. “The fact is that the marginal cost of solar power is moving towards ‘zero’ and this is both transformative and disruptive,” Adani said while addressing participants virtually at the TiE Sustainability Summit being held in Hyderabad. In fact, the Adani Group is increasing its solar power generation capacity three-fold over the next four years. “Our renewables portfolio has reached the initial target of 25GW, a full four years ahead of schedule. Today, we are already the world’s largest solar power player,” he added. Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), on Monday completed the $3.5 billion (Rs 26,000 crore) acquisition of SB Energy India, that has 5GW renewable assets across four states in India through its special purpose vehicles. Overall, the Adani Group will be investing over $20 billion in the renewable energy space over the next decade. Meanwhile, talking about green initiatives of the state, Telangana IT and industries principal secretary, Jayesh Ranjan said 3,000 MW of the state’s energy requirements are fulfilled by solar power. He also highlighted Telangana's afforestation drive Haritha Haram as well as the Kakatiya Mission, wherein the minor irrigation tanks and lakes are being restored. Ranjan said that nearly 85% of the 47,000 tanks have been restored till now. The TiE Sustainability Summit 2021, that has seen over 40,000 people register on its platform, will feature 225 speakers, 65 sessions and 200 investors over a three-day period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/solar-sector-will-see-high-innovation-disruption-adani/articleshow/86761406.cms||---

Most of the degree colleges in the state have adopted the annual examination cycle while there are some which are holding exams in semester mode. This has led to confusion among students as well as teachers. The officials of the higher education department have responded by saying that soon all degree colleges will have the semester cycle being implemented once the UGC releases the guideline to form a ‘higher education commission’. Currently, around 10% of the degree colleges have implemented the semester system. Earlier, more than 100 colleges used to have semester examination cycles, but after protest from the members of the ABVP student union group, it got removed. Meanwhile, several students have raised the issue that they are beingdenied entry into their college campuses if they are not fully vaccinated.

As per an FIR registered on Sunday, the woman received a phone call from a man, who claimed to represent a cellular service provider. He told her to update her ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’ details with the company or her SIM card would stop working. The suspect sent her a link via SMS and told her to fill a form through the link. The unsuspecting woman filled the form, which sought all her financial details. Once she filled the form, the suspects used the details to transfer Rs7.32 lakh from her account. As per the FIR, the fraud occurred in July, following which the woman had submitted a complaint application to the cyber police. Post-verification, the Koregaon Park police registered a formal FIR on Sunday. “The woman received the call from the suspect man on July 30. He claimed he was the representative of a cellular service provider and told her she had not completed her KYC formalities. He said her cellular connection would be deactivated if she did not update her details. He told her to update the details via an online link, sent through an SMS,” senior inspector Rajendra Mohite of the Koregaon Park police told TOI. “The woman, who is busy most of the day, received a text message containing a link. She filled the online form, which sought her bank and debit card details,” Mohite said. After she submitted the form, the suspect called the complainant back, seeking a one-time password (OTP) that she received via SMS. “This way, she shared seven OTPs with the suspect, who transferred the money from her bank account using her debit card details,” he said. The KYC update trick is increasingly being employed by cybercrooks to target people. In August, fraudsters targeted an elderly Wakad resident with a similar trick and siphoned off more than Rs 12.6 lakh from a bank account she jointly operated with her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crook-uses-kyc-trick-dupes-kp-resident-of-rs-7-3l/articleshow/86761424.cms||---

Nitin Prajapati, a resident of Anand’s Chikodhra village, continued this practice even during the Covid-19 induced pandemic after the unlock phase began. Now, Prajapati has embarked on another mission to teach children the basics of Sanskrit while he is himself learning Japanese so that he can teach it to students from poor financial backgrounds. “My target is to learn and teach 11 languages to these children,” said Prajapati, a native of Vagosana village in Gandhinagar’s Mansa taluka. Prajapati who is now more than 50 years old has developed 1,008 teaching and learning material including flashcards, drawings, figures, sketches among others to educate the slum children at four places in Anand. “To learn Japanese, I am going through tutorials and talking the help of my friends abroad. I want to develop learning material in Japanese even for the visually disabled so I will have to develop the material in Braille format as well,” said Prajapati, who set out to impart education to these kids to fulfil the wish of his father who had retired as a teacher in 1998. “When my father — Atmaram Prajapati, who was a government teacher at V J School retired from service as a drawing teacher, he wanted me to continue the tradition of teaching which I have religiously done,” said Prajapati, a graduate from Sardar Patel University affiliated N S Patel Arts College. Prajapati otherwise runs a language centre in Anand where he provides IELTS coaching for students and job aspirants wanting to go abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/teacher-gives-slum-kids-languages-of-hope/articleshow/86760616.cms||Prashant Rupera

The journalist with a local news channel had left home early in the morning to cover the farmers’ protest — Nighasan is about 30km from the site of the killings — and had gone “missing”. News finally did arrive around 10pm, from the mortuary at the Lakhimpur Kheri district hospital. He was dead. Read more stories from Lakhimpur Kheri While counting those killed in Sunday’s violence, Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni had included Kashyap, 32, in his toll of four BJP workers. His family, however, said he was doing his job as a reporter and accused Mishra’s son Ashish and his aides of murder. “He was not a BJP worker. He was a journalist,” SDM Om Prakash Gupta told TOI. “His family has lodged a separate complaint (besides the two FIRs that were lodged on Monday).” “My son was a reporter with Sadhna News (channel) at Nighasan. On October 3, he was at the Maharaja Agrasen Sports Ground to cover the farmers’ protest where Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya were supposed to come,” wrote his father Ram Asre Kashyap in his complaint to the police. “The MP’s son Ashish Mishra and party workers killed my son.” Those at the site said he was shooting a video interview with Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leader Tajinder Singh Virk when one of the cars in the convoy sped towards him. “Eyewitnesses said he ended up shooting the footage of a car that was mowing down farmers, which was why my journalist son was shot at. The footage reportedly recorded the gunshots, too,” his father’s complaint added. Ram Asre is a farmer. His sons Raman, Pawan and Rajat lived together in their house at Nighasan. Raman’s wife is 30 and they had two children, a daughter, 11, and a son, 3. “After completing his graduation, he became a teacher at a private school here,” Pawan, 24, told TOI. “During the pandemic, he lost his job and took up work as a stringer for the news channel. He had been covering the farmers’ protest in these parts for a while now.” When the family saw Raman’s body at the mortuary, Pawan said, they were certain he had been shot dead. “There were bruises on his shoulder, massive head injuries and bullet holes on his chest and right arm,” he said. On Monday morning, after they got the body home, they refused to cremate him in protest. When SDM Om Prakash Gupta met them in the afternoon and agreed to take their complaint, they cremated him. The postmortem had already been conducted but the report was not in at the time of filing. The complaint was addressed to the SHO of Nighasan police station, Ram Lakhan. The officer told TOI he had received it, adding, “The complaint has levelled allegations against Ashish Mishra and his aides for murdering the journalist. Since the incident was reported in Tikunia area, I will be forwarding the complaint to the SHO there.” Watch Lakhimpur Kheri: Kin of journalist Raman Kashyap demands action against culprits||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-listed-as-dead-bjp-worker-by-min-was-journo-say-kin/articleshow/86760681.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

On Monday, a meeting was called by the VMC to discuss the issue. Besides officials of the VMC and city police, top brass of the city unit of the BJP remained present for the meeting. It was decided at the meeting that all cattle owners will have to get RFID tags on their bovine within 30 days. Any cattle impounded without tags later will not be released. The civic body will also increase the number of teams to impound cattle. From three teams a day, the number will be increased to five teams a day. In the two shifts from 7am to 11pm, two teams will be operating in each shift. The fifth team will operate in the night shift thus ensuring stray cattle in impounded throughout the day. A meeting of representatives of cattle owners in the city has been called on Tuesday.

---||Pune||Maharashtra government will disburse funds to kin of Covid-19 victims soon, says Aseem Gupta||PUNE: State principal secretary of relief and rehabilitation, Aseem Gupta, told TOI on Monday that the Maharashtra government will soon start the process of disbursing financial assistance to pay ex gratia to kin of those who died of Covid-19. This will take place after the software for the process is ready, and funds will be disbursed through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), as per Central guidelines. While the cash-strapped state government has already reached out to the Centre for funding, it has now decided to start this disbursal without waiting for the Centre to respond. Gupta said, “We are in the process of developing the system for disbursal of Rs 50,000 each to kin of Covid-deceased. As soon as it developed and rolled out, we will start paying these applicants.”  Authorities assured that the application process would be made simple and a web portal will enable them to keep track of district-wise applications. Gupta added that the disbursal is as per Supreme Court directives and will not be delayed. In the meantime, the state will continue reaching out to the Centre. “Its delays or denials will, however, not affect our disbursal plans,” Gupta told TOI, explaining that this is a directive mandated by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which has clearly recommended that Rs 50,000 be given each to kin of those who died of Covid-19 through the respective SDRF funds of each state. During the course of the pandemic, the state registered 1.38 lakh Covid deaths, which would mean nearly Rs 750 crore would have to be disbursed, even extending up to Rs 1,000 crore. Gupta admitted, “The state is cash-strapped so a letter will be forwarded to the Centre seeking funds. We are requesting NDMA to allocate funds for ex gratia payments. Otherwise, we will be hard-pressed to take up work related to pandemic requirements and other calamities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-will-disburse-funds-to-kin-of-covid-victims-soon/articleshow/86761439.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||‘Criticising govt not cause for sedition’||NEW DELHI: JNU student Sharjeel Imam, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly giving inflammatory speeches in various parts of the country, told a city court on Monday that the prosecution was more of a “whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law”. Imam’s counsel submitted before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that he cannot be allowed to be prosecuted just because he was critical of CAA or NRC. “This is not how the government or executive have to respond. At the end of the day, dispensation will change. Nothing is permanent,” said advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, appearing for Imam. He sought Imam’s bail and subsequent discharge in the case in which Imam has been arrested for allegedly giving seditious speeches at Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia area. During the arguments, Mir referred to the recent Bharat Bandh called by the farmers to protest against the new farm laws, and asked, “Will we call for sedition in all those cases?” The counsel claimed Imam was not a terrorist and not a part of a criminal gang. He further argued that being critical of the government cannot be the cause for sedition. “Since when does the government need the affection of the people? It’s only the monarchs and kings who need the affection of the people. We are not here to bow down before the government…This country is a democracy and stands on the principles of constitutional values. Those values we’re committed to protect today in Sharjeel Imam’s case. He cannot be allowed to be persecuted just because he’s critical of CAA or NRC,” Mir claimed. Referring to the prosecution’s stand that Imam knew how to cause riots since he wrote his thesis on topics related to it, Mir asked whether the prosecution was now going to lay their foundations as to what kind of research was being done in the universities. “Are those the constitutional goals that we set for ourselves?” he further argued. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea and argued that the fundamental right to protest cannot go beyond an extent that causes problems to the public at large. “In a situation which is already violent, the speech is made. The fact is that he wanted to give a secular colour when he said, ‘we should keep a bookstall with the book ‘Why I am a Hindu’ by Shashi Tharoor’… Immediately after his speech on 13th December, various violent incidents have taken place,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/criticising-govt-not-cause-for-sedition/articleshow/86762244.cms||Usha Das

Of these, 20 were related to illegal firearms.The data of previous years shows the Arms Act cases in Ludhiana CP were the highest (49) in 2014; were 37 in 2015; 45 in 2016; 35 in 2017; 29 in 2018; 20 in 2019 and 22 in 2020.The last year’s figure puts Ludhiana CP, along with Hoshiarpur and Tarn Taran district, at second position in Punjab. Amritsar rural has the maximum number of such cases (55). Barnala has just two cases, the lowest. In 2019, Ludhiana was second among the state’s CPs and districts.Ludhiana CP is at number four spot in cases of illegal arms. Amritsar rural is at the top, followed by Hoshiarpur and Bathinda.Residents say the police must check inflow of illegal arms into the city.“There should be better screening at gateways, especially bus stand and railway station, and more checking at the state boundaries to stop the entry of illegal weapons. This will help check crime graph too. Many of the licensed arms holders use weapons irresponsibly. This aspect should also be addressed,” said Amandeep Bains, a social activist and founder of RBS (Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev) roots.A senior cop said, “The number is slightly more as we have recovered more illegal weapons last year as compared with 2019. Besides carrying out checks, we are enforcing norms related to licensed weapons as well.” Ludhiana police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar couldn’t be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-registers-slight-rise-in-arms-act-cases/articleshow/86760684.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Kolkata||Restaurateurs in Kolkata fear footfall dip, pin hopes on order-ins||KOLKATA: The ban on entry into pandals could result in a 20% dip in footfall at restaurants. With pandalhopping no longer the in-thing, restaurateurs expect lunch and dinner hours to shrink while demand for home delivery to shoot up as people gather for parties and adda sessions in homes and housing complexes. During Durga Pujas prior to the pandemic, people either came to restaurants around noon-12.30pm, had a quick lunch and headed to see pandals. Or they came very late, around 3.30pm, absolutely famished and weary after a tour of the pandals. With curbs on pandal entry this year, restaurant owners expect most of the customers to walk in between 12.30pm and 2.30pm, leading to long waits to get a table. “Usually during Pujas, the first group would quickly wind up lunch and leave for pandal-hopping while those who came in late after doing the pandals were weary and hungry. If there is no pandal-hopping involved, people will come in around regular lunch hours and eat leisurely,” said Manthan and Songhai owner Sudesh Poddar. While there would hardly be any gap between lunch and dinner during Durga Puja earlier as lunch time almost spilled onto dinner with customers walking in for lunch even at 5pm, restaurant owners expect lunch to wind up latest by 4.30pm and dinner to start around 7.30pm. “The final walk-in would depend on whether the government extends the closure hours beyond 10.30pm. If people are not roaming the streets, they may walk in latest around 11.30pm,” felt Trinca’s coowner Anand Puri. However, Mocambo and Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari is confident dining at a restaurant will be unaffected by the pandal entry ban. “I have told the person who deals with excise for my restaurant to look for additional licence hours and to take it for as many Puja days as possible. People are fed up of sitting at home for a year and a half and want to enjoy it. We have protocols in place, everyone is vaccinated and it is safe,” said Kothari. Many restaurants also expect many people to stay indoors and organise parties and adda sessions at home during the Puja and are bracing for a sharp spike in order-ins. “We have doubled our own delivery fleet and set up a separate home-order dispatch section,” said Debaditya Chaudhury, MD of Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2. Monica Lieu, who has multiple Chinese restaurants, including Beijing, Kim Ling, Tung Fong and Mandarin, expects a good turnout at the restaurants as well as high demand for home delivery but said the latter will depend a lot on how much support restaurants get from delivery partners. “We are all hoping and praying for great business this Puja,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurateurs-fear-footfall-dip-pin-hopes-on-order-ins/articleshow/86761483.cms||Subhro Niyogi

This important fact of the case was revealed by police first time on Monday while opposing Jain’s anticipatory bail application in the court. The investigating officer submitted an affidavit to oppose the bail plea in which it has been mentioned that Jain had offered the rape survivor the position of CEO and 50% share of profit in the land deal so that she does not go public with the crime and approach police. However, the company in which she was offered the CEO post has not been stated. Incidentally, police have also not revealed much about what deal was going to transpire regarding the Sahara land. The land in question was taken over by the state government in January this year. Investigators also informed the court that Jain had beaten her up and forced her for physical relations. It has also come to light through the statement of Rahil Jain, the owner of the apartment at Nisarg building in Diwalipura, that Jain had paid the last month’s rent on behalf of the woman to him and used to keep an extra key of the apartment with him. Police have, however, not revealed whether Jain used the extra key to visit the apartment in the woman’s absence. The apartment owner Rahil also told cops that the rent agreement for the apartment with the woman was done through Jain’s reference. “The bail applicant’s lawyers had sought another date for the hearing so that they can study the affidavit and put forth their arguments based on it,” said district government pleader Anil Desai.

Tower B will be a completely commercial space and Tower A will be a hotel. Officials said both towers will be connected by the metro, Sabarmati railway station, the HSR station and a BRT station via three foot overbridges. Officials said on the eastern side of the Ahmedabad railway station, towards Saraspur, the HSR station will come up over platforms 10, 11 and 12. Earlier, the station was to be over platforms 11 and 12 only. The bullet train platform will be elevated with walkways connecting to all platforms of the Indian Railways. Officials said in the past it was decided to have underground walkways connecting the platforms, but now they have decided to give the existing walkways a fresh look. The integrated station building in Kalupur station will be equipped with escalators and elevators and will have facilities like booking offices, a passenger lobby, and others.

Earlier in the day, Singh, his aides, and hundreds of villagers of Lohari village (on the outskirts of Dehradun) took out a protest march to demand adequate rehabilitation in lieu of their land being taken for the Lakhwar-Vyasi project. The march commenced from Badawala and was supposed to conclude at the Judo village but police stopped the protesters and subsequently, several of them were taken to police lines. This comes a day after 17 villagers of Lohari village were picked up by the police from the Lakhwar-Vyasi project site and sent to jail under sections 107, 116 and 151 of the CRPC for obstructing the construction of the hydel plant and for failing to abide by court directions to not conduct protest within 200 metres area of the plant. Kulwant Singh, sub-inspector of Vikasnagar police station, said, “The 17 people nabbed on Sunday have been put behind the bars for the next 14 days. However, protestors detained today (Monday) were released later.” The Lakhwar dam is proposed to be the highest dam (206-metre) on the Yamuna river. The project was announced in 1976 and after several glitches, the state government is now pushing to start all the pending hydropower plants. A heavy police force has also been deployed at the Lakhwar-Vyasi project site to stop protesters from hindering the ongoing construction works. Pratima Tomar, pradhan, Lohari village, said, “Instead of giving us our genuine rights, the administration is simply oppressing us.” Meanwhile, Haat villagers, whose houses were demolished by the Chamoli district administration and hydropower company THDC, also conducted a protest against the demolition on Monday. Their houses were demolished last month for the construction of the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti hydropower project even as the matter is sub-judice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pritam-singh-aides-detained-for-joining-protest-against-lakhwar-dam/articleshow/86760709.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Ahmedabad||Honour killing: Gujarat HC orders action against police||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has ordered action against the Banaskantha district police for their inaction to probe a case of suspected honour killing in which a 22-year-old man, Chandubhai Samaratabhai Chenabhai, was found hanging from a tree. His in-laws were against the marriage. Justice Geeta Gopi has directed the district police complaints authority to take “necessary action” under Section 32-I of the Gujarat Police Act against Banaskantha’s superintendent of police, ASP Pooja Yadav, and Dhanera’s police inspector for dereliction of duty and grave misconduct. The high court has ordered the CID (crime) to register an FIR within 15 days and start investigation into the death of Chandubhai. According to the case details, Chandubhai was employed in Ahmedabad as a diamond polisher. He fell in love and married one Pinaben in September 2020. After the marriage, the couple settled in Rajasthan. They got their marriage registered in Panchmahal district on October 3. Pinaben’s family members abducted the couple from Rajasthan and held them hostage in Jadi village. Chandubhai managed to escape and returned to his native village Bhatib. A few days later on October 16, Chandubhai disappeared and his body was found hanging from a tree on October 18. His family members went to register a complaint with Dhanera police, but an entry for accidental death was registered. The family insisted that there were antemortem injury marks on his body and that his death did not appear to be caused by hanging. They insisted that an FIR for murder should be registered. However, the Dhanera police and the superior officers did not budge. This led one of the family members to approach the high court demanding registration of an FIR under Section 302 of IPC. The ASP of Tharad division, Yadav, submitted a report which showed primary evidence of unnatural death, but did not direct Dhanera’s police inspector to register an FIR. The high court found this “quite unfortunate”, and ordered CID to register an FIR and launch a probe into the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-action-against-cops/articleshow/86761462.cms||---

Eight people had died in violence during farmers’ protest here on Sunday. By the following morning, it had turned into a fortress. Read more stories from Lakhimpur Kheri Every 10km along the 80-km stretch from Lakhimpur Kheri to Banbirpur village, farmers had set up barricades. Each vehicle was stopped, the purpose of visit asked and then a decision taken if it could be allowed to pass. The police barricades along the way — there were barely five — did no such checks. The road where the killings took place — four farmers, three BJP workers and a journalist — is just outside the village and close to the India-Nepal border, leading to Tikunia. The track marks of the vehicles that allegedly ran over farmers were fresh, slippers and shoes pressed into the mud, perhaps of farmers trying to flee. The road was littered with flags, posters and banners, remnants of the peaceful protests that took a bloody turn in seconds on Sunday. The two burnt down vehicles that were part of the Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s convoy still lie there — a Fortuner and a Thar. Right next to the road stand four buildings — three single-storey houses and a power sub-station office. “I was outside my house...around 3-3.30pm I heard shouts and screams for help. Two cars were speeding mercilessly ahead, crushing everyone in their paths. Had a bus not come in the way of one of the cars, many more would have been killed. In the confusion, gunshots rang through the air. Four people came out of one of the cars, a Fortuner, and I saw them open fire,” said a fish farmer who lives in one of the three houses. “I ran inside into my house. The gunfire continued. When I stepped out after half an hour by the back gate of my house, I heard a man had run away with help from the police. That man had fired into the group of farmers twice.” Five cops — two women constables and three policemen — had taken shelter at his house when the violence escalated. “They, too, were scared because of the gunfire.

The accused had escaped with the cash by cutting the ATM with a gas cutter. Despite such incidents, many ATM kiosks are not safe.When a team from TOI visited various ATMs in the city on Saturday night, it found that some banks have not taken sufficient safety precautions to prevent more such robberies as many kiosks were unmanned and open. The team from TOI had visited Gill Road, Dugri Road, Model Town, Shastri Nagar, Bharat Nagar Chowk and Kochar Market after 9.30pm to check for the safety of ATM kiosks. Several ATM robberies have been reported in the city. In most cases, the accused have used gas cutters to break open the kiosk and in couple of cases the accused had even uprooted the kiosk and escaped. On September 25, car-borne miscreants first broke open the shutter of ATM kiosk in Bhutta using a gas cutter. After entering the kiosk, the accused sprayed something over the CCTV camera, then using the gas cutter broke open the ATM and escaped with the cash. According to information, the machine contained approximately Rs 18.38 lakh.In April 6, 2020 a case was reported in Kesar Gunj area when a security guard deployed at ATM kiosk had foiled the robbery bid. When the robbers tried to rob the ATM, guard Sadanand resisted them. The accused also attacked the guard with a sharp-edged weapon, however, the guard kept fighting. The accused eventually escaped empty handed. Last year., when ATM robberies were reported, then commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal had organised a meeting with the representatives of the banks. Agarwal had then told TOI that the banks had no funds to hire full-time security guards. He added that the police had started patrolling around ATM kiosks. Commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said, “We are concerned about the security of ATM kiosks. A meeting with the lead bank manager is scheduled this week over it. We will come up with some solutions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/despite-loot-cases-many-atm-kiosks-are-without-night-guards/articleshow/86760703.cms||Payal Dhawan

In her complaint to the police, the 15-year-old survivor said she was raped times by people at various locations between January 29 and September 22. When an accused first raped her in January, he had made a video recording of the act. He used it to blackmail her into meeting his friends who raped her too. The Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing the case, produced the accused in court on Monday, demanding an extension of their custody for two more days, stating that they needed to take the accused to the crime scenes for further investigations. Lawyers representing the accused opposed the demand, claiming the SIT was dragging its feet on the probe. The judge denied SIT’s demand for further police custody and remanded the accused to judicial custody.

---||Nagpur||On Day 1, schools in Nagpur urban record 21% attendance||Nagpur: Seven months after they had shut down in the last week of February due to Covid restrictions, schools in urban areas finally reopened on Monday and registered 21% attendance. Overall, almost one lakh students (29% of total eligible) were present in the classroom in the entire Nagpur district on Monday. While urban schools (Std VIII-XII) got permission to reopen from Monday, the same segment was operating in rural areas since July. From Monday, rural areas also got permission to restart Std V-VIII classes. Chintaman Vanjari, Nagpur district’s education officer, clarified that urban schools do not mean only those within city limits. “They also include those run by municipal councils. They too had been closed along with those from the city. On Monday, total 134 schools reopened under this category. While under city limits, we had 576 schools reopening,” said Vanjari. If past reopening trend is considered, then school attendance has always risen steadily as the days progress. With Nagpur district overall showing 29% attendance on Day 1, education officials predict that the halfway mark will be breached soon. Vanjari said, “In fact, the statistics you see today are a bit low because many schools, both government and private, are closed because they are being used as centres for the local body by-polls scheduled for Tuesday. Also, local holiday has been declared in all these talukas for polls.”Some big brand CBSE schools, however, have decided to ‘wait it out’ for now. A principal, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Parents are not willing to give consent, so the numbers we are getting are too low. Many parents feel that we should wait till Diwali and then reopen after assessing the Covid-19 situation.” In Chandrapur district, 157 schools in the urban areas resumed their physical classes. On Day 1, 25,950 students attended the classes,” said education officer (middle school), Ulhas Naral. In rural areas, 1,066 schools were already functioning. “Here, 67,401 students attended classes on Monday,” said Naral.For Amravati, final attendance figures were not available till the time of filing this report. Here, guardian minister Yashomati Thakur, who visited a few schools, said that proper instructions have been given to the managements.Speaking to students, Thakur stressed the importance of wearing masks, washing hands and using sanitizer.(With inputs from Mazhar Ali & Anil Jadhav)STATS FOR NAGPURUrban area schools (city + mpl councils)Schools reopened | 710Attendance | 46,516Rural area schoolsSchools reopened | 945Attendance | 52,896||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-day-1-schools-in-nagpur-urban-record-21-attendance/articleshow/86760725.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||After schools, academics demand reopening of colleges in state||Nagpur: After the schools restarted in Maharashtra, demands are coming from all quarters to reopen the colleges, which have been closed for one and half years since March 2020.Many principals have approached the Nagpur University administration with a request to resume physical classes, as they were getting requests from the students everyday. The demands grew multi-fold ever since the Maharashtra government announced reopening of the schools.The Bajaj Group of Institutions, which runs many institutions in Wardha and Nagpur under the aegis of Shikshan Mandal, including the GS College of Commerce, had sent a letter to Wardha collector seeking a permission to resume physical classes in their colleges. “We had taken an initiative to inoculate our students in all our colleges. Now, a majority of them are fully vaccinated and therefore, we had requested the collector to allow us to restart the colleges. She clarified that the government was yet to come out with any directives in this regard,” Shikshan Mandal chairman Sanjay Bhargava told TOI.A demand in this regard was also made by many Management Council (MC) members during its recent meetings, but NU administration pointed the fingers towards the government stating that they were instructed to wait till further orders.“Being autonomous bodies, the universities can take these decisions on their own. NU officials told us that education minister Uday Samant had convened a meeting with all vice-chancellors and instructed them that the government would take a decision in this regard, probably by November. It’s surprising that schools are reopened without vaccinating even a single pupil, while colleges are shut even though a majority of students are inoculated,” MC member Vishnu Changde said. Senior MC member Rajesh Bhoyar, who also runs Bhoyar Group of Institutions in Wardha, said that the government must be concerned about outstation students as the hostels across all state universities were occupied by the government for treating Covid patients. “Even as the situation is under control in Vidarbha, the condition in Mumbai and Pune is yet to be normalised. On the other hand, there is a huge backlog of examinations in Mumbai University. The government is wary of the deadly virus striking back if colleges are reopened, so it is adopting a wait and watch approach. Undoubtedly, the students are suffering, particularly those from the engineering and science faculties, who were practical in their courses,” he said.Academics speakExcept 1st year, college students usually over 18 years of ageMost have taken jabsMany educational groups like Bajaj have inoculated studentsUnlike school kids, college students are matured, follow SOPsStudents can maintain social distancing, wear masks in classesMake it mandatory for students to have both jabs before attending classes||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-schools-academics-demand-reopening-of-colleges-in-state/articleshow/86760711.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Pune: Authorities mull measures to curb crowding at airport||PUNE: Airport authorities are considering a reduction in the number of flight movements every hour to reduce crowding at the terminal. Since September 2020, civilian flights at the airport operate between 8am-8pm due to runway re-carpeting work. The airport handles 114-120 flight movements between this 12-hour window. Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke told TOI that the number of flights being operated per hour is beyond the current capacity. “We can tconsider limiting the number of flights but that will mean flyers will face even more issues. Crowding is mainly due to bunching of flights,” said Dhoke. “There is no shortage of CISF personnel and additional manpower has been deployed. The number of flights has gone up and the airport is currently operational for civilian flights for 12 hours only,” added Dhoke. A flyer on Sunday complained of chaos during security clearance. “It seems that the security staff is not adequate to handle such high passenger volume. ,” said the flyer. Hashim Shaikh, who was flying to Delhi on Saturday, too complained of overcrowding. “From jostling and shoving to cussing, passengers were doing it all at the security check counters,” he told TOI. Dhoke said flyers were letting tempers fly without being responsible themselves. “According to the instructions given by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, all airports have to be on the highest form of alert,” said Dhoke. According to the airport director, many flyers reach at the last moment. “They reach late and then panic and hurry ,” said Dhoke. Aviation analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar said the Airports Authority of India (AAI), must take the blame to a large extent as it always looks at profitability while clearing new flights without considering the situation on the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/authorities-mull-measures-to-curb-crowding-at-airport/articleshow/86761465.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation urges metro roadwork||AHMEDABAD: A stern direction was issued by the state government to the civic authorities recently to ensure that Ahmedabad city roads are repaired within a set timeline. With that in mind the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has now warned Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation Limited (GMRCL) to ensure that 12 major road stretches along the metro corridor be repaired immediately, as they are currently non-motorable. The AMC has asked the metro rail officials to avoid skipping the periodic road repair meetings and has sought GMRSCL representation for the road repair meeting on October 10 or face consequences. In a sternly worded letter to GMRCL the AMC has said, “It may also be noted that failure to attend the October 10 meeting shall be taken seriously and this notice shall be constrained to attend the same at risk and cost of GMRCL.” A copy of the letter is with TOI. The letter of the deputy municipal commissioner R K Mehta says that a meeting regarding repair works was called on August 12 and yet the metrorail construction companies were not able to adhere to deadlines and ensure timely repairs. “You are aware it has been decided that all roads parallel to Metro routes shall be kept in good condition and be maintained by GMRCL. In this regard It is once again pointed out that below road stretches are repaired on urgent basis,” the letter states. Among the 12 stretches are Helmet-Vijay Crossroads, Commerce Six Roads to Stadium Crossroads, followed by Havmor Junction towards old high court and the riverfront approach road. The AMC has also claimed that in many stretches along the metro corridor storm-water drains and sewer lines are lying silted and broken and need either repair works or complete replacement. Meanwhile, the AMC over the last 10 days has undertaken patching of roads across the city. “Between July 1 and October 3, the civic body has patched up 20,369 potholes on bad road stretches using wet-mix, cold-mix and hot-mix asphalt,” said an AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-urges-metro-roadwork/articleshow/86761493.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad becomes part of alliance of 30 river cities||AURANGABAD: Amid concerns of the ecological damage to the two rivers that flow through Aurangabad — Kham and Sukhana — the Centre has selected the city to be a part of a national alliance of river-basin cities. The ‘River Cities Alliance’, which will be formally launched next month, will serve as a platform for the authorities of the “river cities” to engage in conservation through collaborations and learning from each other’s initiative, the officials said. While the housing and urban affairs ministry, through its nodal organisation National Institute of Urban Affair (NIUA) is working with the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) under the Jal Shakti ministry on promulgating river-sensitive development in the cities concerned, the alliance is envisaged as a platform for the river cities to interact and share best practices for a sustainable unified vision of healthy rivers. Civic body chief Astik Kumar Pandey on Monday said that Aurangabad and Pune are among the 30 cities selected from across India for the formation of the River Cities Alliance. “Experts from NMCG and NIUA will serve as resource persons for the alliance. While we have already undertaken a public campaign for the ecological restoration of the Kham river since January 2021, the participation in a national level alliance will serve as a shot in the arm for the necessary rejuvenation of rivers,” he said. The alliance, which will be a community of river cities in India, is expected to provide a framework and tools for planning and management of urban river stretches. As a member of the alliance, every city will have to prepare a detailed project report for rejuvenation of rivers in its jurisdiction. Pandey said the central initiative has adequate scope for customisation to address local issues of the Kham and Sukhana rivers. “The civic administration is facing a dearth of funds to link the drainage network of the city with different STPs. This is leading to the direct release of sewage into the river stretches. The new avenue of funding through River Cities Alliance could be utilised to achieve the desired linkage,” he said. NMCG director general Rajiv Mishra, while addressing an onboarding workshop for alliance members, said: “There is a need for an urban river management plan to make the cities smart enough to recharge our the waterbodies. A river sensitive master plan must be created and implemented by the cities that must take ownership of their waterbodies, vegetation and riverfronts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-becomes-part-of-alliance-of-30-river-cities/articleshow/86761474.cms||Prasad Joshi

The network of peddlers is now on city police chief Amitesh Kumar’s radar with action expected at several locations soon.Sources said rave parties are usually organized at discreet locations, like row houses and farmhouses on the outskirts, service apartments, hotels booked online, and some hookah joints, where only a handful are invited for the special occasion. “As strangers are not invited or entertained, cops have less chance of getting information of these parties,” said a source. “Drugs flow freely in many high profile parties too, which are attended by influential people and their family members,” the source added.CP Kumar too said he had been receiving feedback about rave parties and drugs available at pubs, but no specific input so far. “Strong legal action would be initiated if any rave parties or such nefarious activities are found within city limits,” said the top cop. Under him, this year MD drugs worth more than Rs50 lakh have been seized, with the arrest of 23 persons till September. Kumar has also urged citizens to share information about drugs and peddlers on 112 or 100 for quick action.Till September this year, there has already been a 209% jump in action against drugs in comparison to 2020. Now, the drive is being pushed further by the top brass with surveillance being stepped up near schools, colleges and hostels. A major component of the drive is to target drug consumers in public places and illegal joints.In the backdrop of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son being arrested in connection with a drug case, the CP said last week a brainstorming session of top cops had already taken place in which cracking down upon drug cartels and racketeers in the city had been the main agenda.“We have now basically formulated a three-pronged strategy,” said the CP. “Firstly, pharmacies have been told to avoid counter sales of drugs like Alprazolam, Nitrazepam and other scheduled drugs without following the norms,” he said. “Secondly, we will crack down upon ganja sale and consumption, and lastly, surgical strike on MD racketeers,” said CP.This year, till September, police stations and crime branch under DCP Gajanan Rajmane and Addl CP Sunil Phulari have ensured arrest of 286 persons in 216 cases, which included 113 cases for consumption.CP said the names and whereabouts of racketeers have already been collected for stringent actions. “We are trying to reach the root of each drug syndicate,” he said.Kumar has also appealed to family members of consumers to seek help of counsellors and psychiatrists, and also police, if necessary, to wean away drug users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rave-parties-under-scanner-cops-prepare-for-surgical-strike-on-drugs/articleshow/86760736.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||Delhi: More measures needed to control vehicular pollution, say experts||NEW DELHI: Experts say the winter action plan announced by the government is not enough to combat air pollution this year and more steps are needed to control vehicular pollution, waste accumulation, landfill fires and strengthening the monitoring network. Track the pollution level in your cityPriyavrat Bhati, sector head, climate, environment and sustainability at Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, said while efforts were being taken to reduce air pollution, one of the keys polluting sectors, transportation, was being largely ignored with more focus on monitoring than controlling emissions. “Dust and vehicular pollution are key sectors in terms of their overall contribution to Delhi’s air. However, the action plan has nothing on making the public transportation system more robust, promoting its usage and curtailing the use of vehicles. While many teams are being formed, the focus is more on levying penalties and monitoring each site or hotspot. Instead, the focus should be on controlling emissions at these places in the long term,” added Bhati. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said successful implementation of the winter action plan would depend on the ground-level preparedness and robustness of infrastructure for waste management to prevent garbage accumulation and landfill fires, stopping dirty fuels in all industrial units, stringent surveillance of dust control measures at construction sites, intensification of public transport services with restraint measures on traffic, among others. “However, several measures are not included in the action plan and information on system preparedness for effective intervention is not available. We need that planning right away for effective management of winter pollution,” said Roy Chowdhury. Sachchida N Tripathi from the civil engineering department at IIT-Kanpur and a member of the steering committee for National Clean Air Programme said the plan lacked long-term efforts, especially in terms of capacity building and using technology-based approach to tackle air pollution. “Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been understaffed for a while now and in an audit done by us a few years ago, it was functioning at one-third of its capacity. If environmental engineers are being added to the green war room, it would be better to add air pollution experts first to tackle the problem. There is also a need to strengthen the overall monitoring network and use the data generated to tackle each source,” said Tripathi, adding that formation of teams in each head appeared a more short-term solution. A few experts welcomed some steps in the plan, but felt that the government should look into more areas. Anju Goel, fellow, earth science and climate change, The Energy and Resources Institute, said the winter action plan had some good steps, like upgrading the Green Delhi app and strengthening the green war room, but more needed to be done. “To control vehicular pollution, the PUC system needs to be revamped and fleet modernisation of heavy-duty vehicles should be done. Besides, there is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of smog towers. It’s a costly solution instead of focusing on the root cause of the problem,” added Goel. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “In addition to the sources that the winter action plan tackles, the government should also ensure that Delhi’s urban poor have access to alternatives to using biomass for their heating requirements.” Prof Sagnik Dey, coordinator at Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air, IIT-Delhi, said the key was implementation and identifying midway what was working and what was not for course correction. He added that stubble burning without interstate coordination couldn’t be controlled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-measures-needed-to-control-vehicular-pollution-say-experts/articleshow/86761622.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Ahmedabad||Man exonerated in two rape cases||Ahmedabad: Rasik Solanki (24) from Kapadvanj faced rape charges twice and he was exonerated on both the occasions. Now, those who filed complaints against him are facing criminal charges. In this curious case, Solanki was booked for rape and Pocso charges for raping a minor girl and for impregnating her. This happened three months after the alleged victim delivered a baby girl, which was abandoned in October 2020. The DNA test revealed that Solanki was the biological father, but the victim was not the mother of the baby. This proved that the alleged victim was not raped. A special Pocso court in Nadiad acquitted Solanki of rape charges. However, during investigation, the Kapadvanj police found out from the DNA report that the complaint lodged by the alleged victim and her mother was not true. Upon interrogating the witnesses, the cops suspected that Solanki had a love affair and relationship with the elder sister of the alleged victim, and the baby was born to the elder sister. The family was concerned about its social image and therefore it hid the real victim. To set things right, the cops summoned the elder daughter and registered an FIR on February 26 against Solanki for raping he. He was once again booked under Pocso Act. A day later, the police registered one more FIR in this case, this time against the mother and her younger daughter for filing a false FIR. Solanki had to rush to the Gujarat high court to seek bail in the second rape case. He also filed a quashing petition through advocate Vishal Anandjiwala. The victim appeared before the high court and stated that she wanted to live with Solanki and consented to quashing of rape and Pocso charges. The high court has recently quashed the second FIR lodged against Solanki, who now lives with the complainant and the baby, his lawyer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-exonerated-in-two-rape-cases/articleshow/86761473.cms||---

Forest veterinary official CH Praveen Kumar performed the autopsy in the presence of Warangal chief conservator of forest, S J Asha, Mulugu district forest official (DFO) Shiv Asheesh and Mulugu forest divisional officer (FDO), N Jogendra. “ Taking into consideration the size of the bones and the structure, it looks more like a female tiger than a male,” said Kumar. The veterinarians, however, said that a 100% confirmation of the gender can be possible only after DNA analysis. Meanwhile there was some speculation about a tiger cub being killed along with adult tiger in the incident, after some wildlife experts and tiger conservationists claimed that the skin seized from the poachers was too small for an adult tiger. Forest official, however, refuted these claims. Asheesh said: “We apprehended suspects during a vehicle search. They led us to the kill sight from where we recovered the skeletal parts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tiger-killed-in-mulugu-dist-was-female-pme-report/articleshow/86761478.cms||Moulika.KV

Currently, 12 patients are admitted there and the figure has remained the same for last one month. In case NMC has to vacate it, the civic body will have to start a new centre at another facility. “We have VNIT hostel, Vanamati and Law College hostels. But these places don’t have facilities like MLA Hostel, which is also centrally located,” Joshi said.The additional municipal commissioner said that as long as it is feasible, the civic body would continue to place all new patients in institutional quarantine. “The move has helped us keep the spread of Covid-19 under control, better than other cities. When people resist getting quarantined at MLA Hostel, we request them to at least get admitted at AIIMS Nagpur or a civic-run hospital. We are also giving them the opportunity to get admitted in a private hospital,” he said.Joshi added that once again, the trend of more than one member of a family testing positive was evident in daily cases. “Recently, when the city recorded cases between eight and 10, two or three were from the same family. In these cases, when patients were shifted to the CCC, even their neighbours were relieved,” he said.Last month, TOI had reported that some private hospitals had restarted their Covid wards with limited beds after they got several admission queries. As per earlier norms, hospitalisation was not permitted for asymptomatic persons, but NMC revised the norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-rules-out-immediate-plan-to-stop-institutional-quarantine/articleshow/86760732.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Hyderabad||Will visit Lakhimpur Kheri: Owaisi||Hyderabad: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday said he will visit Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh where eight people including four farmers died in violence. He demanded that a sitting judge of the high court or the Supreme Court should monitor the inquiry. It was a state-sponsored violence, and both the Uttar Pradesh and central government should be blamed for the incident as the union minister of state for home had made a provocative speech a few days ago that they can finish off things (farmers protest) in two minutes which led to this incident, he alleged. He also demanded that the Uttar Pradesh home minister should step down until the inquiry is completed. His visit to Lakhimpur Kheri would be to express solidarity with the farmers who died after being knocked down by a car in which Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar’s Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra was apparently present.. Farmer leaders have claimed that Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son Ashish was in one of the cars which allegedly knocked down some protesters who were protesting against the deputy CM’s visit. However, Ajay Mishra denied that he and his son were present at the spot as alleged by some farmer leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-visit-lakhimpur-kheri-owaisi/articleshow/86761485.cms||Roushan Ali

Read more stories from Lakhimpur Kheri The minister, too, has been booked for criminal conspiracy. A deadlock between protesting farmers, who refused to cremate the bodies of those who died on Sunday, and the administration was resolved by Monday afternoon after a meeting. The government has promised a judicial inquiry headed by a former high court judge, compensation of Rs 45 lakh each to the kin of the dead and a government job each for the bereaved families. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI, “Eight deaths have been confirmed, including that of a journalist. Cross FIRs have been registered at Tikunia police station (under whose jurisdiction the violence took place on Sunday). One, by farmers’ families against Ajay Mishra for criminal conspiracy and Ashish Mishra for murder, causing death by negligence and criminal conspiracy. The second was lodged by the family of the driver who was killed, against unidentified persons, for rioting.” No arrest was made till the time of filing the report. Bharatiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk, however, disputed the numbers. “Two men were beaten to death by protesters,” he told TOI. “Those people had opened fire on farmers. In self-defence, the farmers took action. They were protesting peacefully. There was no intention to kill anyone.” Prohibitory orders have been in place in the district since Sunday night. Internet services remain suspended. Political representatives who tried to visit the village on Monday could not. They were either detained, stopped or prevented from landing in Lucknow. “Do not allow any political representative to enter Tikunia,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had told farmers, protesters said. BKU chief Naresh Tikait, meanwhile, warned BJP members against visiting villages in the area. “I have appealed not to invite any MP or MLA from BJP in the villages. It is better for these leaders to stay away or they will be responsible for any untoward incident.” Farmers initially refused to cremate the bodies of the dead or send them for autopsies. The bodies lay in four freezers at the protest site. After Tikait got there along with other farmer leaders, talks began with the administration. In a meeting at a school in Banbirpur that began at 5.30am, Tikait, Virk and other farmer leaders raised the farmers’ demands — that Ajay Mishra be sacked, all the accused be arrested, the investigation be wrapped up in 14 days and Rs 1 crore handed out as compensation along with a government job for the families of each who died. On the other side of the meeting were ADG Kumar, DM Arvind Kumar Chaurasia and Kheri SP Vijay Dhull. After several rounds of talks over eight hours, a common ground was arrived at. “A judicial inquiry will be conducted, headed by a retired high court judge who will investigate the violence. The families of those who died will get Rs 45 lakh as compensation and one government job each. Those injured will be given Rs 10 lakh each,” ADG Kumar said. “Anyone who has any evidence should approach the inquiry committee.” After the meeting, Tikait told the farmers they should hand over the bodies — which they did around 2.30pm. A panel of five doctors at the Lakhimpur Kheri district hospital is conducting the autopsies of all who died on Sunday. “It is a moral victory,” Tikait said. “If the government does not do justice and stick to its words, we will launch a protest again.” He has announced a mass meeting on the 13th day of the funerary rituals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-union-mins-son-booked-for-murder-judicial-inquiry-ordered/articleshow/86760740.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Singers ready to rock||Ahmedabad: This Navratri, the glamour is finally back to sheri garba which was often overshadowed by the garbas organized at clubs and other venues on a commercial scale. Thanks to the restrictions imposed by the state government in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, this time, garba events will be limited to smaller venues organised within residential colonies and that too with a cap of maximum 400 persons. Since the focus has shifted to residential colonies, many popular garba singers and artists are now collaborating with smaller groups to celebrate Navratri. For instance, popular playback singer Parth Oza, along with his group of musicians, has collaborated with residential societies as well as farmhouse owners to perform. “Sheri garba has been a cultural trend since years and it was overshadowed due to large-scale events. It is a delight to perform at this point in time, because we will be able to bring in the traditional flavours of garba to our performance. It is better that sheri garba is back now, and musicians will benefit in a big way as garba is finally being organized. I look forward to performing my upcoming song too,” said Oza. Singers have specifically picked certain songs to perform to suit the sheri garba flavour. “It’s a delight that Navratri is finally taking place this year and I am all game for performing. This time, we will be able to give a more personal touch to the performance as it is for smaller, private groups,” said Bhumik Shah, playback singer. “We’ve specifically chosen certain garba songs which were traditionally sung at the time of sheri garba. We have also chosen certain specific instruments including flute, dhol and shehnai, among others,” Shah added. Not all artists however are performing this time. Some are taking a break to be able to rather enjoy the revelry. Aishwarya Majmudar, a singer, said, “There are quite a few inquiries this Navratri but it is not likely that I would be performing all days this time around. Instead, I’d rather choose to participate in the festivities and enjoy the nine nights of revelry. It will be a good change I look forward to.” Even though events are limited to smaller groups, khelaiyas and enthusiasts are looking forward to the event. “I’ve not missed a single night of Navratri till 2019, with last year being an exception, and I’ve been to all the popular venues with my friends. But this time, I’ll be participating in the sheri garba at the society with equal enthusiasm. In our busy lives, we often don’t know or interact with people living in our own neighbourhood. Navratri festivity would be a great opportunity to get to know people I live around,” said Bhargav Korat, a software engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tunes-of-sheri-garba-back-singers-ready-to-rock/articleshow/86761495.cms||---

The previous orders regarding imposing NSA in the state were issued in July this year and were valid till September 30, officials told TOI. Additional secretary, home, Ridhim Aggarwal said, “The state has delegated the powers of NSA to the district magistrates. The move is meant to empower DMs to invoke the NSA in case the situation warrants.” The notification states that “anti-social elements are involved in adverse activities to create problems related to safety and law and order.” It further mentions that “considering the existing situation and future threats, the state government has agreed to extend the time limit of imposition of NSA.” Notably, a few days ago, the state government had also issued a communication hinting at possibilities of communal disturbance due to demographic changes in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-extends-nsa-imposed-in-state-till-dec-31/articleshow/86760738.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Vadodara||Road ban on Dalit man, four convicted||Vadodara: Four residents of Ajwa Road were convicted on Monday for stopping a dalit man living in the same neighbourhood from using a narrow lane in the locality, hurling caste-based abuses at him and attacking him in August 2018. The court of special judge (atrocity cases) S C Gandhi ordered the four convicts Gopal Machhi, Bharat alias Revlo Machhi, Jayesh alias Lalo Machhi and Ramesh Machhi to simple imprisonment of two years and fined them of Rs 5,000 each. The court also asked the four convicts to pay compensation of Rs 2,000 each to the complainant Jayesh Parmar. As per the details of the case, Parmar was stopped by the four convicts on August 12 in 2018 when he was going to buy milk pouches on his scooter. They addressed Parmar using a casteist slur and asked him not to use the lane. Later, they beat Parmar using pipes and Bharat alias Revlo hit Parmar with a sickle on his head. Parmar had become unconscious due to grievous injuries and was taken to SSG Hospital for treatment. He had given a statement to cops based on which a case of assault, causing hurt, wrongful restraint and under various sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was registered at Bapod police station. All the four attackers were arrested and later tried in a special court for atrocity cases. “There was much evidence against the attackers and eyewitnesses too had deposed against them. The court upheld all submissions made by the prosecution for convicting them,” said additional public prosecutor B S Purohit. The four convicts’ lawyer had requested the court to be lenient with them considering their economic backgrounds and not punish them. The court, however, turned down the argument by stating that the four attackers had forgotten their moral and social responsibilities by their act. The court also mentioned that the attackers had even forgotten Mahatma Gandhi’s message of compassion and non-violence towards living beings so the defence lawyer’s request cannot be accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/road-ban-on-dalit-man-four-convicted/articleshow/86760750.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colootola fire rages for 9 hours, brings back Bagri nightmare||KOLKATA: The horrors of the Bagri Market fire returned to haunt Burrabazar on Monday morning after flames engulfed a four-storey commercial-cum-residential building on 11, Colootola Street. Till late in the evening, almost nine hours after the blaze broke out, the fire department said pocket fires were still being doused on the second and third floors of the building merely 200m from Bagri Market. Police sources said no life was lost. The floors were stacked with combustible plastic rolls, toys and garments, and it was difficult for firemen to reach the source of the fire due to blocked entrances and overhead wires. Till last reports came in, 24 fire tenders were still working. According to locals, at least two persons had to be rescued from the building. No confirmation of the same, though, has come from the administration. The loss is estimated to be worth crores. According to sources, the building has 60 godowns where garments and plastic items are stored, apart from gas cylinders and other combustible material. The rear of the building houses 20-odd families. The fire reportedly broke out in a warehouse on the second floor a little after 10.30am. The fire department received the distress call at 10.50am and deployed six fire engines. However, seeing how fast the fire was spreading, 14 more were rushed to the spot. By late evening, four more fire tenders were pressed into service. Teams from the Hare Street police station and the disaster management department were also involved in the rescue operation. “We checked for anyone trapped inside,” said an officer. “We cut the grilles and made way for the firefighters,” said a DMG official. Mohammad Ilyas, a local who owns a godown in the building, said, “We saw smoke coming out and reacted quickly. All the people were taken out safely. The magnitude of the fire was such that, within a few moments, the area was filled with black smoke.” Locals alleged that firefighters reached the spot long after getting the news. Fire minister Sujit Bose, however, denied the claim. “Our firefighters had reached on time. The place was very difficult to access. But firefighters have done their best to contain the blaze within the building. There are some pocket fires still raging, but we hope our officers will get it under control soon. There were at least three cylinders that burst while our men were working. Thankfully, none was injured,” said Bose, who reached the spot to oversee the operation. Local MLA Vivek Gupta also visited the spot. “We will ascertain if the firing-fighting equipment were in place here. We will lodge a case once we receive a complaint from the fire department,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colootola-fire-rages-for-9-hrs-brings-back-bagri-nightmare/articleshow/86761508.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Pune: Farmers’ groups plan to expand weekly markets||PUNE: Farmers’ groups are planning to approach the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the state agriculture marketing board to expand the weekly farmers’ markets by identifying locations to organize the same in the 23 recently merged villages. The groups said they would suggest a joint survey be conducted of the possible locations for the weekly markets, which would also give residents an option to buy fresh vegetables and fruits. At present, the farmers’ groups hold such markets at over 60 locations in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. They also deliver to housing societies. Over 1,000 farmers are attached to bigger groups, who supply their produce. The locations have been identified jointly by the farmers’ groups and civic bodies. Narendra Pawar, who has been associated with the weekly farmers’ market for the last few years, said there was a need to review the existing locations and also identify locations in the newly merged areas. Sources from the merged areas said many illegal vegetable markets were operating in their areas and there was a need to regularise these. Deepak Ghule, a Manjari resident, said, “There are vendors on almost every street and most are unregulated. An initiative like farmers’ market would provide fresh produce and reduce footfall at the these markets.” Madhav Jagtap, the PMC’s deputy commissioner, said they would review the farmers’ markets in the city and would check the authenticity and take help of local corporators for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmers-groups-plan-to-expand-weekly-markets/articleshow/86761504.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Now, FIR against Roorkee church pastor, officials after woman's complaint||DEHRADUN: A day after a case was filed against 250 people, including BJP and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) members, for allegedly vandalising a church in Roorkee, police on Monday booked 10 people from the church management after a local woman gave a complaint alleging she was "assured money and a job" if she agreed to convert and then "thrashed when she rejected the offer". This came even as BJP state chief Madan Kaushik waded into the controversy and said "acts of conversion" had been reported in the area. “Conversion by force or by luring any person will not be tolerated in Uttarakhand. We have a strict law for it,” he said. The complainant, identified only as Sonam, alleged that she was offered Rs 2 lakh to convert and promised a house and a job. “They abused us, thrashed us and robbed our cash and jewellery when we refused,” her complaint said. Police have booked the church management, including the woman pastor, under sections 395 (dacoity), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intend to outrage her modesty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 120b (criminal conspiracy), 153 ( promoting enmity between two different religious groups), 384( extortion) and 504 (intentionally insults) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the SC/ST Act. Priyo Sadhna Porter, pastor of the church, dismissed the allegations and said they had sought police protection earlier this week as they had anticipated an attack from right-wing groups. “All allegations of the woman are false. We are the victims in this case,” she said. Circle officer (Roorkee) Vivek Kumar said the investigation has started. “We will take further action depending on what we find in our probe,” he said. A mob had allegedly vandalised the church, attacking five people during a Sunday prayer meeting. Two women had sustained injuries in the attack. Police had registered a case against members of the BJP and VHP as well as 200 unidentified people. The BJP state chief said the party was not involved in the incident. “It was the local residents who expressed their anger,” he said. Congress, however, said BJP was using "polarising tactics" ahead of assembly polls. Former chief minister Harish Rawat said, “An attack on a place of worship is a serious matter and it is politically motivated. Members linked with a political party are involved,” he said, adding that barely few months before the state polls issues like demographic changes and conversion are being raised by the ruling party for political gains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-fir-against-roorkee-church-pastor-officials-after-womans-complaint/articleshow/86760765.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Pune||Heavy rain alert for central Maharashtra and Konkan from Oct 6||PUNE: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an isolated heavy rain warning for Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan from October 6-8, especially in the ghat regions. Five districts, including Pune’s ghat areas, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur and Satara, have been put on an isolated heavy rain alert for Tuesday as well. Most other locations are likely to witness thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds, IMD said. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune, told TOI, “A cyclonic circulation over southeast Arabian Sea between 4.5km and 5.8km above mean sea level will influence the upcoming rain spell in parts of the state by bringing in sufficient moisture. The system is causing moisture incursion especially over southern Maharashtra. This incursion, coupled with high day temperatures and fairly strong sunshine, is likely to lead to local instability, resulting in the formation of cumulonimbus or thunder clouds.” Kashyapi said the upcoming rain spells would, thus, be of convective nature and be accompanied by lightning and thunder. “These spells may, however, not be the typical monsoon season type of showers. The showers are likely to be short and intense in nature,” he said. The current 48 hours, however, will witness of subdued rainfall in all four regions — Konkan-Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha. “The monsoon activity will increase over South Maharashtra around October 6. Konkan-Goa and Madhya Maharashtra ghat areas have an isolated heavy rain warning for all the five days from October 6,” Kashyapi said. Districts like Palghar, Thane, Mumbai, Dhule, Nandurbar and Hingoli are likely to get light to moderate rainfall while Amravati, Buldhana , Bhandara, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli, among others, are likely to get scattered showers over the coming few days. On Monday evening, thunder cells were seen over the Sahyadri ghats and adjoining areas, indicating presence of cumulonimbus clouds, which caused some intense thundershowers in parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-rain-alert-for-central-maha-konkan-from-oct-6/articleshow/86761516.cms||---

The traffic police will get point of sale (POS) machines from the State Bank of India under the CSR activity and switch to the new mode, which is only for the compoundable challans, around Dussehra. In the first phase, the traffic police will get around 25 POS machines. Joint commissioner of police (city and traffic) Deepak Pareek said, “We are trying to make the best use of technology in policing. Earlier, we had started e-challans in which the cameras captured the red-light jumpers and an automated challan was sent to the vehicle owner and the facility of online payment was also provided. Now, we will provide the facility of on-the-spot e-payment for compoundable challans. Some other cities, like Chandigarh, have this facility.”“The regional office of the State Bank of India is providing us with the POS machines, which we will get around Dussehra, after which this facility will start,” Pareek added.There are two types of challans, compoundable and non-compoundable. Non-compoundable challans are those for which the violator has to visit the court and the compoundable are those in which on-the-spot cash payment can be made. If a person fails to make cash payment, (s)he has to visit the regional transport authority (RTA) office to pay the challan. At times, the traffic police send the challans to RTA late and people have to make rounds for the payment. The one-the-spot challan e-payment will make the process smoother and hassle free.Gurdeep Singh, a resident of Harbanspura, said, “I was issued a challan for not wearing a helmet on September 1 and I was asked to appear at the RTA office for the payment on September 28. When I reached there, I was told that there was no entry of my challan in the system. Now, I have been asked to come on December 2.”Another city resident said, “Challan payment at the RTA office is a hassle. A person has to stand in queues, besides the RTA office is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. There are touts too who charge Rs 300 to Rs 500 extra to help in making the payment. Payment through a POS machine is an appreciable initiative, as it will also check corruption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/on-the-spot-challan-e-payment-soon-police-to-get-machines-by-dussehra/articleshow/86760761.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Kolkata||Puja parikrama on cycles in Salt Lake, Sector V & New Town||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is launching a bicycle Puja parikrama on Mahalaya. The app-monitored parikrama will start on Shashthi morning and run on all the days of Durga Puja. Guides will escort each team of cyclists to the popular pujas across Salt Lake via Sector V and New Town. The idea behind this puja parikrama is to promote cycling as a pollution free mode of transport during the festival. Besides, it will also enable the pandal hoppers to maintain distancing, which needs to be maintained in Covid times. However, the NKDA is yet to finalise the time limit for each tour, though the authority has decided that it will start early in the morning and end with lunch. The parikrama will start from the Biswa Bangla gate and also wind up there each day, after which lunch will be served to the participants. “We want to start the parikrama early so that we can avoid the traffic in Salt Lake during peak hours. At Newtown, we have dedicated cycle tracks, so there shouldn’t be any problem. We have worked out a map so that the most important pujas of Salt Lake like the ones at BE, FD, FE blocks and Swimming Pool can be covered,” said the NKDA chairman, Debashish Sen. After registrations, the participants will get cycles from the organisers and be able to download the app that will make them access a voice guided map on their smart phones. After the announcement on Wednesday, people can register for the parikrama by Shashthi. “Our marshals will ensure that the participants take the charted route. The participants will hand over the cycles to the marshals after the tour,” said Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-parikrama-on-cycles-in-salt-lake-sector-v-new-town/articleshow/86761522.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

It appears to be a deliberate act to kill them,” Vissa Kiran Kumar of Rythu Swarajya Vedika said. Although a bigger protest was planned at the Dharna Chowk near Indira Park, Kiran Kumar said they were not able to get police permission in view of the assembly session. Organisations which came under the banner of All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee demanded that an enquiry be conducted by a sitting judge of SC into the incident and the guilty punished. Chief advisor of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association P Chengal Reddy said while the government had come up with the farm laws, its rules were yet to be framed for anyone to oppose them. “The point is that government has come up with what it feels is what should be done. Since this has become contentious, the SC would be right in speeding up process of giving its judgment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-protest-against-lakhimpur-incident/articleshow/86761511.cms||---

The only survivor in the deadly crash was an 8-month-old child, who is battling for life in a hospital in Meerut. 30-year-old Tanzim Khan, the man behind the wheel, may have dozed off, police believe. Tanzim, his wife Ashma (28), his mother Nafisa Khatoon (61) and two other relatives, Zuberia and Fazila, were killed on the spot in Meerut’s Partapur area. Police had to cut the car’s windows and doors to get the bodies out of the vehicle.

The CM, however, clarified that it was technically not possible to waive the academic fees, which was the prime demand of the doctors. “Instead, the chief minister proposed additional ‘academic allowance’ to all of us for the entire pandemic period. This was accepted in-principle by the delegation of resident doctors,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale, president of the central committee of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD). “The second issue was deduction of TDS from stipend. “Exemption from TDS on stipend of the residents working under Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been referred to the commissioner and it will be discussed with chartered accountants and resolved at the earliest. Thirdly, renovation and construction of hostel facilities will be addressed before a month, the doctors were assured,” said Dr Dhobale. Initially, the resident doctors were insisting on written assurance from the state government. But, they settled for the verbal promise by the chief minister. Cabinet minister for environment and tourism Aditya Thackeray also joined the discussion. However, the minister for medical education Amit Deshmukh was not present. Members of central MARD told TOI that secretary of the medical education department Saurabh Vijay also attended the meeting. Deshmukh is likely to meet the resident doctors in the next three weeks as the CM has assured to fulfil the demands in time-bound manner within a month. “CM Thackeray has directed the finance and medical education department to come up with solution within a month. We hope all our demands will be fulfilled. In good faith and for the sake of patients, we are calling off the strike,” said Dr Sajal Bansal, president of MARD at GMCH. Assurances Again MARD members were firm on written assurance, but CM gave only verbal promise Prime demand of academic fee waiver was settled for ‘academic allowance’ TDS on stipend is Mumbai-specific issue, hence BMC commissioner told to resolve it Govt agreed to improve hostel facilities by renovation and reconstruction in a month||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-call-off-strike-on-cms-assurance/articleshow/86760773.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Employment, productivity in Pune region at 18-month high||PUNE: The September results of the monthly regional economic survey conducted by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA) showed that employment and production levels in Pune region touched an 18-month high. As per MCCIA’s report, employment stood at 87% — a bit higher than the 86% in August — and productivity increased by five percentage points to 88%. The previous high was achieved in February this year, when production and employment stood at 85% and 86% respectively, and when the second wave struck, both metrics plunged to 69% and 70% respectively. The numbers improved subsequently, despite concerns over high raw material prices and poor demand, and production and employment increased, as per the July survey’s findings. MCCIA started conducting the monthly survey from April 2020 in a bid to track the changes in the local production and employment scenario. Improvement was seen across the board, with both large industrial units and the crucial micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) recording strong growth in productivity. An increasing number of companies surveyed, including those from the services and manufacturing segments, reported reaching or closing in on pre-pandemic levels of production, while more said that they expected a return to full capacity sooner than previously expected. MCCIA said that it was crucial for the momentum to be maintained in coming months for meaningful recovery. “Almost half the companies surveyed are already at the pre-pandemic level of production and are poised to enter the growth phase soon. This has propelled the return of labour from farms to factories, from rural to urban. If this momentum sustains for another couple of months, we would be looking at overall industry growth from the first quarter of the next calendar year,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of MCCIA. Girbane said better recovery also hinges on the potential third wave of the pandemic, as well as authorities deciding on further easing of restrictions, especially in the food and beverage sector, which is still limited to relatively early closing times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/employment-productivity-in-region-at-18-month-high/articleshow/86761540.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The cops have written to the district collector to act against the concerned officers. The police said that Sindhi was in the sub-jail when the crime branch took his custody on June 3 in connection with the prohibition case lodged against him at Manjalpur police station. After the investigations, Sindhi was sent back to the jail on June 17. However, the police inquiry revealed that Sindhi was set free from the jail on August 13 despite him not getting bail in a prohibition case lodged against him at Manjalpur police station. The jail officials didn’t even make entry of the crime branch, giving them custody of Sindhi. The police will also approach the Gujarat high court to cancel the bail of Sindhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-complaint-against-waghodia-jail-officer/articleshow/86760792.cms||---
---||Kolkata||10 new Labradors to add teeth to Kolkata police’s depleting dog squad||KOLKATA: Come April, 10 new members from Haryana will join the Kolkata Police dog squad. The improved Covid situation has brought back the confidence in cops that the situation is now conducive for new recruitment. The healthy additions will take the squad’s strength to the designated 48 posts, said police sources. Sources said the additions had “become a necessity”. With two members dying and eight others retiring, the squad has been reduced to just 38 dogs. “Our workload has increased and we do not want to tax a highly trained dog too much,” said a police officer. All the 10 dogs to be inducted in the squad will be Labradors. Lalbazar had to reverse one of its decisions taken earlier this year to carry out the tender and subsequent procurement. The cops had earlier wanted to wait for the Covid situation to improve before making any further purchases. The decision was taken since outdoor training had almost stopped during the Covid second wave. “We usually retire the dogs after eight to 10 years of active work. They have to be fit and agile to do the job. The dogs need to be taken out and trained across the city to make them aware of actual working conditions. They also need training on the road to strengthen their feet. Those in the explosives and drugs detection units need to get on-ground training under actual conditions. Usually, a part of this training is done at the Maidan and Rabindra Sarobar. But as Covid second wave turned deadly, we stopped this activity. The training was taking place within the confines of the Police Training School. Thus, it was difficult to train new dogs under those circumstances. But with the situation now improving, we reviewed and then reversed our decision and bought these dogs,” said an officer. The decision to procure the dogs also became important after an experiment — that began in December last year — failed to get the desired results. The dog squad — working under the detective department — had decided 10 months ago to carry out breeding from within its own force, hoping that they can induct the offspring into the force. The two Labradors chosen for this purpose were both experts in detecting explosives. “While we have brought dogs from breeders for breeding, this was the first time both the male and the female were chosen from our force. There were two purposes — one, the belief that their offspring will possess their qualities and two, try and cut down on the entire process of buying the dogs. The experiment was also notified to the state veterinary directorate. But, the offspring has not been born yet,” explained a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10-new-labs-to-add-teeth-to-city-polices-depleting-dog-squad/articleshow/86761545.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Nitish Kumar questions NITI assessment method||PATNA: Questioning the NITI Aayog’s assessment system, CM Nitish Kumar on Monday said Bihar as on date could not be compared with the country’s richest state Maharashtra. “Is it proper to compare the country’s richest state with the poorest state?” he asked. Reacting over the NITI Aayog’s recent performance assessment report on ‘district hospitals in India’, in which Bihar has been shown among the worst performing states in some categories, Nitish said he was not aware as to how and through whom they assess works. “Bihar has done a lot to improve the health sector ever since people gave us a mandate to work in the state. We brought phenomenal improvement in providing medical facilities. But the NITI Aayog makes similar assessments about many states across the country. I have raised these issues (related to faulty assessment) in the NITI Aayog’s past meetings,” Nitish said while responding to a media query after his janata darbar programme in Patna. Expressing his displeasure over Bihar’s poor ranking in the Aayog’s latest report on the district hospitals, Nitish said, “You (NITI Aayog) should know the latest facts before making assessment. How can you compare the country’s richest state with the poorest one? Is it a proper method to do an assessment to know about something?” He also said his government would soon send a point-wise reply to the Aayog on what they have published in the assessment report. Recalling the poor state of hospitals in Bihar before he came to power in 2005, Nitish said very few people used to turn up at the government hospitals for treatment. “But after we got an opportunity to serve the people, the number of patients at different government hospitals swelled by thousands,” he said. The CM also said if he gets an opportunity to attend a formal meeting of the NITI Aayog in future, he would once again raise all these issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-questions-niti-assessment-method/articleshow/86761544.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Pune||Pune: Water release stopped from most dams for now||PUNE: Water release from major dams in the Bhima basin, including the reservoirs around Pune, has been stopped following a drop in rainfall activity in the catchment areas over the last two days. The state irrigation department, however, said it would allow discharge again if there was continuous and heavy showers in the catchments. The stock in the Khadakwasla dam has been brought down to 70% as a part of precautionary steps to accommodate water released from upstream reservoirs. Last week, the irrigation department had released water from seven dams. Popatrao Shelar, deputy engineer at the irrigation department, said, “We have stopped the discharge as water requirement in the rural areas has been met as of now. Besides, the rainfall activity in the catchments of upstream dams has reduced. There are sporadic showers, but the catchments have not received continuous rainfall in the last couple of days. The water release from Panshet and Varasgaon for the power house has also been stopped.” Irrigation department officials said the release of water would begin in case of increase in the rainfall activity in the catchments. “We will initiate release based on inflow of water in reservoirs. We are monitoring rainfall activity in the catchments,” the officials said. The collective stock in the four dams in Khadakwasla circle reached 97.8% on Monday. The elected representatives in the Pune Municipal Corporation have said the irrigation department should take stock of storage every week since the monsoon season is about to end. Ujani storage at 97%With 52 TMC water Ujani’s in storage climbed to 97% on Monday. Ujani is the largest dam among 25 major reservoirs in Bhima basin. The state irrigation officials said they would release water from the dam only after its stock reaches above 100%-mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/water-release-stopped-from-most-dams-for-now/articleshow/86761526.cms||Sarang Dastane

He was on a visit to Joshimath in Chamoli district on Monday to oversee the ongoing search and rescue operation and conducted the aerial survey of avalanche-hit Mt Trishul. As reported by TOI, the bodies of four people — three naval officers and a JCO, were found on Saturday. Speaking about the expedition, vice-admiral Berry said, "The mountaineering expedition, which was named ‘From INS Trishul to Mt. Trishul’ was conducted by western naval command as part of Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebration. The 20-member team was flagged off on September 3 and they were supposed to return back by the mid of October, after summiting the peak.” He added, “All the members of our team were highly trained climbers, each having the experience of at least three to four big mountaineering expeditions. Three out of the five naval climbers who went missing had also scaled Mt Everest.The weather conditions on the day of the summit were perfect for climbing. But unfortunately, the first team got trapped in a sudden avalanche. The last leg of Mt Trishul has an incline of around 60-80 degrees and this was the place where the avalanche happened.” Meanwhile, the last rites of Lt Commander Anant Kukreti were performed with full honours by the Indian Navy in Haridwar on Monday.

---||Nagpur||BJP threatens to shut down Baranj OC mine||Chandrapur: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with the help of villagers of Chek Baranj and Baranj Mokasa, has threatened to close down the private Baranj opencast (OC) coal mine owned by Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) on October 13. Former finance minister and MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar would lead the agitation to press the demands of project-affected people (PAP) and rehabilitation of the two villages, said BJP district president Deorao Bhongale. KPCL had commissioned the Baranj OC mine after acquiring 1,457 hectares of land from 804 farmers from Chek Baranj and Baranj Mokasa villages in 2007. But the mine was closed in September 2014, following de-allocation of coal blocks to private coal mines by Supreme Court. KPCL, however, reacquired the same coal blocks and resumed mining from December 16, 2020. “Coal production formally began in March 2021 and company has excavated over 5.50 lakh metric tons of coal since then. But none of the PAPs working in the mine have been given their salaries since re-commissioning of the mine. The wages of five years of close down period of the mine, between September 2014 and December 2020, too are pending,” said Bhongale. Leader of the PAPs in two villages, Pravin Thengne said that following the protests of PAPs, KPCL had entered into agreement with the state government. The company had agreed to provide jobs to all PAPs or monetary compensation against the job, rehabilitation of the project-affected villages, rightful facilities to the workers, returning 50% of acquired land to farmers concerned after preparing it for agriculture, acquiring 5% of unacquired land of the two villages etc. “However, none of the demands were fulfilled in the last five years. We had approached guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar and district administration, urging them to not allow mining there till the demands are met. Although Wadettiwar assured us in writing, he allowed the company to start the mining,” Thengne said. Bhongale added that after the PAPs approached Mungantiwar, he held separate meetings with division commissioner, company officials and district collector to resolve the issues and followed it up. “However, the company management has not budged and continued the mining with the help of workers from other states. Over 350 workers from other states are working in the mine, violating the 80% local workers’ regulation of the government. Management is threatening and beating up the PAPs with the help of criminals deployed as patrolling squad,” he charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-threatens-to-shut-down-baranj-oc-mine/articleshow/86760782.cms||Mazhar Ali

Harvest in a number of pockets is reported to be delayed by 20 to 25 days as the fields are still wet. This has prevented cotton boll formation to the full capacity, in turn, holding up the harvest.If farmers in Vidarbha are still hoping for some sunshine that may save the crop, cotton growers in neighbouring region of Marathwada are already reported to be in losses due to excessive rains. Once it gets dry, there are chances of pink bollworm pest affecting the crop, said experts.This is the second crop at stake after soyabean. Farmers in both Vidarbha and Marathwada have reported losses as their soyabean output was reduced to 50%. The rates of soyabean too have halved to Rs4,500 from Rs9,000 in the beginning of the harvest season as low quality is one of the reasons.Last year, cotton growers had to face low rates due to Covid pandemic. The pandemic restrictions had also hit the MSP (minimum support price) procurement and there were reports of pink bollworm infestation too.Officials in the agriculture department contacted by TOI said there are losses, but only in low lying areas of Vidarbha. There may be losses, but not as much to create a crisis, said the officials.In Yavatmal, a group of farmers had blocked the road to highlight the situation. Their demand is that state government should carry out assessment of the losses and declare a compensation.Manish Jadhav, a farmer who led the protests, said the losses are severe as the fields are still waterlogged.“Cotton arrivals, which begin by Dussehra, may be delayed by 20 days or so,” said Sudhir Kothari, a director in Hinganghat APMC, one of the major markets for cotton.President of Shetkari Sanghatana Anil Ghanwat said farmers of Marathwada are already in losses. Fields located near dams are already flooded because gates have been opened due to heavy rainfall. “Shortage of soyabean is expected this time, so are the cotton supplies,” he said.Former director of Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) CD Mayee said even as the situation in Vidarbha is under control, there are major losses in Marathwada. There are chances of pink bollworm infestation once it gets dry. There are also reports of cotton bolls rotting, he said.Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist from Wardha, said the crisis may also hit the farm workers’ earnings. In some places, the crops are not even in a condition to be harvested.Farmers TOI talked to in different districts said there are chances that the yield may be reduced to half, if there is no dry spell soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cotton-crop-at-risk-again-vid-farmers-seek-govt-aid/articleshow/86760790.cms||Shishir Arya

The department already has invited tenders for the internal roads, apron (for parking the aircraft), and the regular parking lot, the expected cost of which is also between Rs 20 and 25 crore. The PWD confirms that the work is yet to be awarded to any agency, since that’ll be done after the government gets approval.The tender for the 250-metre taxi-way that will connect the upcoming airport complex the with the Halwara Air Force Station’s runway has been floated and the project’s expected cost is between Rs 20 and 21 crore. The PWD officer said that after they float the tender for the terminal building, it will take a month for the process to be completed and another 15 days before it is awarded. He added that the work on the approach road and the boundary wall was over. Meanwhile, sources in the Airport Authority of India (AAI) said that the proposals (in the form of tender documents) were with their planning department and will be produced before the AAI’s board for final approval. The board might seek clarifications on these proposals. An AAI officer, asking not to be named, said: “We wish to have a 2,000-square-metre Porta cabin on the site so that we can shift the operations from the Sahnewal airport to Halwara, where landings can happen in very low visibility, while earlier the flights used to get cancelled when the visibility dropped. Also Halwara has a much longer runway compared with Sahnewal.”The officer added that airport’s terminal complex will have all the latest equipment, including Cute (common user interface terminal) system, inland baggage, and face-recognition for walk-through identification of the passengers. The local business community of this landlocked industrial city has waited long for this airport.Krishan Kumar, a city businessman, said: “As of now, we have a single flight from Ludhiana to Delhi, which is suspended for many months now. But after the international airport comes up at Halwara, we might get to travel by air to many of the national and international destinations. This will help a cross section of society, including businessmen, professionals, and students.”Box 1: To cover 135 acresThe government had made an official statement last year that it will fulfil Ludhiana’s long-standing demand for an international airport. Also, that the Punjab government is trying to make this airport operational in another two years and six months. The first phase will include developing the international civil terminal area over 135.54 acres for full-fledged operations of up to Code-4C-type aircraft.Box 2:Will operarte 172 Boeing flightsThe AAI officials had said that against Sahnewal’s capacity of holding just 72-seater ATR flight, the Halwara airport will be able to operate 172 Boeing flights. The airport building will have three terminals, one each for international, domestic, and cargo flights.Box 3:For jobs, investmentDuring a visit to city on August 7, the-then Punjab chief secretary, Vini Mahajan, had said that the international airport at Halwara will be ready by January to improve the industrial city’s air connectivity and bring investment and jobs to the Manchester of India and its wider district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tender-for-halwara-intl-airport-terminal-this-week/articleshow/86760781.cms||Shariq Majeed

The gang was extorting money from innocent people in the forest and agency areas. Police seized Rs 13,50,000 cash and four handwritten letters in the name of CPI Maoist leader Damodar, one fake pistol, one MI TV, mixer grinder, a bike, Zest and four mobile phones from their possession.  Speaking to media, Mulugu SP Sangramsingh J Patil stated that a businessman from Eturunagaram told the police that the unknown persons threatened him by giving a CPI Maoist party letter demanding Rs 20 lakhs.  Eturunagaram sub-inspector Srikanth Reddy and staff apprehended the accused and seized a fake pistol. During the interrogation, the accused revealed three other gang members' names. On a tip off , police arrested the other three persons from NH 163 at Roheer. The accused have no connection with leaders of Maoist party. Their sole motive was financial gain in order to ease debts. During interrogation, the main conspirator revealed that as all of them were in financial crisis, in order to get easy money, they planned to commit extortion in the name of CPI Maoist party leader Damodar. Three months ago, he approached the other two accused persons and decided to collect donations in the name of CPI Maoist party. They wrote letters in the name of Maoist party leader Damodar. Over a period of three months, they gave these letters to four persons in Mulugu district and demanded money ranging between Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 20 lakhs. Out of the four whom they targeted, one person fell for the trap and gave them Rs 15 lakhs in cash and did not inform anyone out of fear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-fake-naxals-held-for-extortion/articleshow/86761551.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Pune||Pune: Six held for duping people with cheap forex deal bait||PUNE: The Bibvewadi police on Monday claimed to have busted a gang behind the recent spate of cheatings over ‘cheap’ foreign exchange deals. Six suspects, including a woman, were arrested on Friday. Police are now searching for the ring leader and his aide. The gang would offer to exchange UAE dirhams for Indian currencyat a low rate, summon them to an isolated spot and flee with the cash. Senior inspector Sunil Zavare said the gang was wanted in four such cases — two registered by the Bibvewadi police and one each by the Vishrantwadi and the Lonikand police. “The suspects led the investigators to 10 other spots where they claimed to have robbed their victims,” said Zavare. The inspector pegged the collective amount stolen in 14 cases at Rs35 lakh, and suspected the gang’s involvement in similar crimes in Mumbai too. “All six are natives of Malda in West Bengal and were residing in rented houses in Hadapsar. In between, they also stayed in Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, among other cities. We have recovered Rs51,000 cash, 750 UAE dirhams, 14 cellphones, 12 SIM cards and other valuables from their possession,” said Zavare. The six suspects have been identified as Muhammed Ubeidulla Muddasher Shaikh (30), Babu Fulmiya Mulla (32), Usman Mutalif Ali (27), Mohammed Kamran Khan (28), Ridoi Rahim Khan (23) and Pakhi Subhan Malik (27). On September 16, a 28-year-old had lodged a complaint with the Bibvewadi police stating that two men robbed him of Rs2 lakh cash using the cheap forex lure. As the two men were in touch with this complainant for some days before the robbery, the police took their cellphone numbers and began analysing call detail records. The police came across one number from Vishrantwadi which turned out to be that of the gang’s next victim, who had been called near Dandekar Bridge for a similar deal. The police asked the Vishrantwadi target to follow the gang’s instructions and then laid a trap on Friday, leading to the arrests. According to assistant inspector Usgaonkar, the ringleader and his aide would talk to drivers of businessmen or top officials of private firms. “The unsuspecting drivers would spread word among their employers, who would then contact the suspects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-held-for-duping-people-with-cheap-forex-deal-bait/articleshow/86761553.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Hostel crumbling, BJ Medical students demand new facility||Ahmedabad: Students of B J Medical college held a protest rally on the campus, marching with empty buckets to draw attention to the urgent need for repair and maintenance at the girls’ hostel facility. The existing facility is lying in shambles and is not ‘liveable’, according to a representation made by the Junior Doctors’ Association to the college authorities. In their representation to the college authorities, the students said there were issues related water availability and drainage problems due to which students had to go without a bath for days together at times. Also, the hostel students were at risk of being electrocuted due to faulty wiring, it said. “The college authorities have submitted a proposal to the state government for construction of a new hostel as restoration work of the existing facility is difficult,” said a senior faculty member, seeking anonymity. However, students allege that this proposal has been pending with the state government for the past three years. There are about 300-400 medical students using the hostel facility, and some of them recently shared videos and photographs of the dilapidated condition of the buildings. “The walls and ceilings are damaged and poses great threat to the lives of the students living on the premises,” according to the letter. The letter also raised the issue of the boys’ hostel being located about 1.5km away from the college and the need to bring it within the campus. There are about 700 students pursuing undergraduate medical courses who live in this hostel and faced transportation issues. “As the boys’ hostel building did not have necessary clearances, there is issue of availing drinking water in the buildings,” said sources. The college authorities said they have begun some repairs for now and hope to get a permanent solution by replacing the existing hostel blocks with new ones once they get a green light from the state government. In their representation, the association also said that students from All India Quota pursuing super-specialty courses are not required to sign any bond and the same benefit should be extended for Gujarat students too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hostel-crumbling-bj-medical-students-demand-new-facility/articleshow/86761572.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Propelled by hirings and sub-7% interest rates, realty recovers after second wave||PUNE: Local and national real estate observers have found that housing sales in the Pune area reached or crossed the pre-pandemic levels in the July-September period this year, as well as in the first half of 2021, with more sales in larger homes and launches of large housing societies with open spaces. An observer said the growth in the city’s housing market was primarily driven by a blend of good hiring across the manufacturing and the crucial IT and ITeS sectors. Another factor is the sub-7% interest rates on home loans being offered by nearly all banks and housing finance corporations. This has incentivized more people into the housing market, despite the absence of sops such as a two-step cut in stamp duty announced last year. “The sale of housing units priced below Rs70 lakh per unit was 69% in January-July 2019 compared to 63% during January-July 2021, indicating rise in sales of higher-ticket size housing units this year. Pune witnessed launches of large-sized projects in January-July 2021,,” stated a report commissioned by Credai Pune Metro on housing sales and trends in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad areas. Knight Frank India, in its sales and launches assessment for the July-September period, found that the year-on-year sales increased by almost double (94%) and sales growth over an average pre-pandemic quarter in 2019 being more than double (117%). Launches grew by around 28% (year-on-year) in the city and its surrounding areas, it added. “Pune has been a home for several migrants from across the country. In addition to being an IT sector-driven city, it caters to more than 400 manufacturing plants in Chinchwad alone,” said Rajani Sinha, national director of research and chief economist, Knight Frank India. JLL found that the city’s market grew sequentially as well. The observer stated that the increasing rates of vaccination were helping home sales recover after the shock at the height of the second wave of the pandemic in April and May. “Sales grew in the July-September period over the April-June period by around 67%. This indicates that the market sentiments are improving compared to the previous year,” said Samantak Das, chief economist of JLL India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/propelled-by-hirings-sub-7-interest-rates-realty-recovers-after-2nd-wave/articleshow/86761548.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Pune: Six held on charge of abducting vendor||PUNE: The Hinjewadi police on Friday rescued a 32-year-old herbal medicine vendor abducted on September 28 for Rs25lakh ransom. The police team, led by senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant, arrested five kidnappers, hailing from Thane, as well as the mastermind from Marunji. “The suspect, Pravin Chitodiya (24), hatched a plot to kidnap the victim following an old monetary dispute,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. He said that the victim runs a business of herbal medicines in Marunji area. He has purchased a piece of land there. “Chitodiya thought that the victim had made a good amount of money and decided to abduct him for ransom,” Krishna Prakash said. The commissioner said that on September 28, Chitodia abducted the victim along with his car. “The next day, the victim’s brother received an extortion call. He informed the police immediately,” He said. Police managed to lay traps and arrest the abductors. They also rescued the vendor. He said that the kidnappers revealed Chitodiya’s name during questioning. “He was arrested from Marunji,” Krishna Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-held-on-charge-of-abducting-vendor/articleshow/86761543.cms||---
---||Kochi||Despite getting an extra year, Kochi gas project far from over||KOCHI: The fate of the city gas project which was started in 2016 with much hype is in limbo. The renewed tenure of the project expired in September 2021 and the number of piped natural gas (PNG) connections given so far is less than 4,500, the target is 40,000 though. A couple of months ago, Indian Oil Adani Gas Private Ltd (IOAGPL), the implementing agency, had given an application for extending the tenure to March 2022. But the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) hasn’t given the nod for extending the deadline so far. The IOAGPL had given similar request just before the tenure of the project expired in October 2020 and the PNGRB gave an extension up to September 2021. But the IOAGPL failed to complete the project even after getting an extension of one year. According to the officials with IOAGPL, the project was delayed due to various reasons, including Covid-19 pandemic. “We had to face hurdles like the floods in 2018 and 2019 and Covid-19,” an official with IOAGPL said. “As the pandemic has applied brakes on almost all projects across the country, we are hopeful that the PNGRB will give its nod for extending the project by six more months,” the official said. Even if the PNGRB gives nod for extending the deadline by six more months, completing the project will be a herculean task. The project was launched in Kochi by the then chief minister Oommen Chandy in February 2016. “We have given PNG connections to around 4,250 households so far,” officials associated with the project said. The tussle between the IOAGPL and various local bodies is another reason for delay in implementing the project. There had been dispute between IOAGPL and various local bodies over digging up roads for laying the pipeline as part of the PNG distribution network. As the progress of the project continued to be around five percent even after three years of starting the work, the then district collector S Suhas had convened a meeting of IOAGPL and representatives of Thrikkakara municipality in January 2020. As per the decision of the meeting, the IOAGPL should have completed the pipe-laying works in all the 43 wards in Thrikkakara municipality by April 30, 2020. Another decision was that the work on the project would be started in Eloor, Aluva and Tripunithura municipalities once the work at Thrikkakara is completed. But the IOAGPL couldn’t complete the laying of the pipeline as promised. “Now, the laying of pipeline is progressing in 13 wards in Thrikkakara. We have given around 3,000 connections in the municipality,” officials with IOAGPL said. On Friday, industries minister P Rajeeve convened a meeting to expedite the project. The meeting attended by Hibi Eden, MP, Kochi mayor M Anilkumar, MLAs, heads of various municipalities and the officials with railways, National Highways Authority of India and various departments decided to expedite the works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/despite-getting-an-extra-year-city-gas-project-far-from-over/articleshow/86761547.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Dehradun||Terai farmers demand min’s resignation, death penalty for son; former CM courts arrest||Rudrapur: Hundreds of farmers associated with the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) staged protests across the Terai region of Uttarakhand on Monday, demanding resignation of the Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni and death penalty for his son Ashish Mishra, who has been accused of leading the convoy which allegedly mowed down four protesting farmers in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri. In Dehradun, Congress leader and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat and other party members courted arrest against Sunday’s violence and detention of Priyanka Gandhi, who was on her way to meet affected families in Lakhimpur Kheri. Rawat along with some party members was taken into preventive custody soon after the group staged a protest in the premises of the office of the senior superintendent of police (SSP). “First, the farmers were left to die in extreme winter and when they remained adamant, their voices are being suppressed by running them over. This is not murder of farmers, but that of democracy. This government (UP government) should resign and the Union minister be sacked,” alleged Rawat. In Udham Singh Nagar — the food bowl of Uttarakhand — as well, scores of farmers under the banner of BKU marched towards the district magistrate office. They were stopped at the main entrance of the collectorate by the heavy police force deployed there. The farmers have demanded an ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore for the family of each deceased farmer and government jobs for their family members. A candle march was conducted in Bajpur while Congress workers gheraoed the police station in Kashipur. The protests came even as the president of the Terai Kisan Mahasabha (TKM), Tejender Singh Virk, who was injured in Lakhimpur’s violence, is fighting for his life, according to a friend of his family. Vikramjeet Singh Virk told TOI, “Tejender was admitted to a private hospital in Rudrapur, but he has been referred to a higher centre in Gurugram. He has a skull fracture and a part of the bone has entered the brain. There is clotting in the brain.” BKU state president Karm Singh Padda likened Sunday’s violence to Jallianwala Bagh. “Decades ago, innocent Indians were killed by the British during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. In this case as well, innocent people have been killed to weaken the farmers’ movement against the farm laws. We will not tolerate atrocities of the BJP government. We will seek justice for our companions who lost their lives to the cruelty of a BJP leader. He must resign and his son should be given death penalty,” Padda said. Members of the city traders’ union, Gurdwara Guru Singh Sabha, Sanatan Dharm Sabha and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also participated in protests in US Nagar to extend support to farmers.

---||Pune||CNG prices rise to Rs 59.50/kg in Pune, petrol stays stable||PUNE: The price of CNG saw an increase in Pune on Monday, while prices of petrol and diesel remained stable. The cost of one kg of CNG, which was stable at Rs57.50 since August, rose by Rs2 to Rs59.50 per kg. The last price rice was in August when the price of CNG climbed to Rs57.50 per kg from Rs56.60 per kg. The petrol and diesel prices, which had been on a rise for almost a week, stood at Rs107.95, and Rs 96.50, respectively on Monday. Officials of the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited, which supplies CNG to the state, said that the rise in the cost of raw materials had jacked up the price. The rise in CNG prices will hit autorickshaw drivers the most. Apart from autorickshaws, PMPML buses and private vehicles also run on CNG. “A Rs2 hike is too much. But we cannot raise the fares without the approval of the RTO. Any kind of hike in fuel prices is a concern, considering the financial problems we have been facing,” an autorickshaw driver said. There are around 80 CNG stations of MNGL in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cng-prices-rise-to-rs-59-50/kg-in-city-petrol-stays-stable/articleshow/86761567.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||Missing cat sends Air India, Kolkata airport staffers into a tizzy||KOLKATA: Even as Kolkata airport is looking for an agency to rid the terminal of cats, a different cat-hunt is underway to locate a pet that went missing on Saturday. The 14-month-old Dice, a male cat that had reached Kolkata on Saturday afternoon in an Air India flight, tucked inside a plastic cage in the aircraft’s cargo hold, had gone missing immediately after it was brought down from the aircraft. When the Air India cargo team broke open the cage, the cat reportedly escaped. But the pet owner, Mayurakshi Saha, who works with a social media company, refused to buy the claim and wrote to the animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi, who in turn has written to Kolkata airport authorities that have embarked on the cat-hunt. “This incident shows a blatant negligence on the part of the airlines. How could they be so irresponsible? It was their duty to hand over my pet safely to me. The cat was like my own child and I will not leave the terminal until I get him back,” said Saha, a resident of Santoshpur. On Monday, the cat was reportedly spotted by some ground staff at the old domestic terminal but by the time they reached there, the cat had left. A separate team of officers are also monitoring the CCTV on the airport premises to trace the animal. On Saturday, Saha was travelling to Kolkata from Bangalore with two of her cats. While the airline allowed one of them to stay with her in the cabin, the other one was kept at the cargo hold. “When I got down in Kolkata and went to the cargo hold area to take him, I found the cage broken and my cat missing. It was a clear case of mishandling. The airline officials acted in a way that it was a no big deal. Instead of trying to find a solution, they went ahead and laughed while I was crying,” she said. Saha alleged that while she was crying and looking for the pet, the airline officials allegedly made fun of her and didn’t do anything to search for the pet. The woman herself kept on asking people within the terminal about the cat, holding its photograph when a private airline employee told her that he had spotted the cat sitting inside the cargo hold. Air India officials said they have apologised to the woman for the incident and that they have been conducting a thorough search along with the woman across the terminal. “We are the most trusted airline for carrying pets. We carry 100 pets every day. This is an aberration that the cat escaped from the cage. We are leaving no stone unturned to trace Dice and unite it with the owner,” said an Air India spokesperson. “Air India is putting up a relentless effort and a dedicated team is working tirelessly to trace the pet,” he added. The airport director C Pattabhi said they have also deployed senior officials to oversee the search operation, adding, “We empathise with the woman’s pain and are extending full support to find the missing cat.” “I have already started a social media campaign to find Dice. I have sought permission from the authorities to put up posters outside the terminal with a cash prize to the person who helps me find my cat,” Saha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-staffers-go-on-cat-hunt-after-womans-missing-complaint/articleshow/86761563.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Pune||Pune, Mumbai lag southern cities on office space absorption, rents||PUNE: A report by real estate consultant Anarock has found that three south Indian cities — Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad — are well ahead of their western counterparts like Pune and Mumbai in the office space market. The report found that increase in net absorption, new completions, and rents in office spaces in the former was catalysed by robust hiring and growth in the IT and ITeS sectors in the 2020-21 fiscal. That said, the report added, Pune fared slightly better than Mumbai, especially in year-on-year growth of lease rent, which it attributed to the city’s thriving IT and ITeS sectors. “The remarkable growth in the office space market of the southern cities, when viewed against their western and northern counterparts, is directly attributable to robust demand by the IT/ITeS sector, affordable rentals, and the exponential growth of startups locally over the past few years. The manufacturing and industrial sectors are also driving demand there,” Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, said. Meanwhile, a report by JLL stated that demand for urban logistics in India, driven by so-called “dark stores”, will reach 7 million sqft by 2022, with 74% of the demand expected in Tier-I cities, including Pune. “Urban logistics will play a more pent rominrole as consumers become more tethered to the convenience, and hygiene benefits of online purchasing.The surge in e-commerce has led to increased storage space and logistic delivery needs, giving owners and developers a clear opportunity,” Radha Dhir, CEO and country head of JLL India, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-mumbai-lag-southern-cities-on-office-space-absorption-rents/articleshow/86761557.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Kolkata||Firemen battle narrow lanes, wire mesh & combustibles before fighting flames||Kolkata: Staircases stacked with cartons, shops filled with garments, leather goods and shoes, multiple godowns with plastic and cardboard on the premises and a congested alley difficult for even a single fire tender to squeeze through — obstacles cropped up for the 200-odd firefighters and almost an equal number of locals who joined the operation to douse the blaze on Colootola Street on Monday. “The building is nestled among narrow lanes and was very difficult to reach. The biggest challenge was to locate the seat of fire, right in the middle of the building with all access roads either blocked or stacked with combustible items. Our officials tried multiple times, but failed to gain entry till the afternoon,” said a firefighter. Eventually, the imams of the Colootola Masjid on the opposite side of the building, opened their doors so firefighters could climb to its roof to spray water from above. “The place was stacked with combustible items and the fire spread rapidly. Our officials did a good job in restricting the blaze within the building, but pocket fires are blazing,” said state fire minister Sujit Bose. The mesh of overhead wires, both outside and inside the building, added to firefighters’ problems, as did the lack of a steady water source nearby. “Firefighters had trouble setting up the ladder because of the overhead wires. The fire was further fuelled by at least three gas cylinder that burst. Somehow, our men escaped safely,” said Bose. With no gap between the walls of adjacent houses — which is against the KMC norms — residents of those buildings were evacuated as well. Shop owners in the adjacent buildings removed items from their establishments in fear of fire spreading to their stores. “Our primary objective was to ensure the buildings next to the premises that caught fire were safe. We managed to do that, but this particular building was stacked with so many combustible items that even till night we had to work in turns to douse the flames with the firefighters,” said Sk Aslam, who works at a local garment shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/firemen-battle-narrow-lanes-wire-mesh-combustibles-before-fighting-flames/articleshow/86761570.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Delhi||Will soon pass instructions on Muslim marriage registration: Delhi govt to HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Monday assured the high court that it would examine and pass appropriate instructions on registration of Muslim marriages under the Compulsory Marriage Order, which provides for immediate registration without any delay or notice, within two months. Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a petition alleging that Muslim marriages are being registered under the Special Marriage Act instead of the Compulsory Marriage Order, was informed by the Delhi government that presently, the legal format for an application does not mention “Muslim marriage” or “Christian marriage” as one of the options. “We are writing to the authorities to get it corrected. We will rectify for both Muslims and Christians,” the counsel submitted in response to petitions seeking the court’s intervention. In one case, the petitioner informed the bench that in spite of the marriage being a Muslim marriage and not an interfaith marriage, a couple that had escaped from their hometown to solemnise the union in Delhi was being subjected to a 30-day notice period under the Special Marriage Act. The petitioner’s counsel explained the differences between the Compulsory Registration of Marriage Order and the Special Marriage Act. He said Compulsory Registration of Marriage Order is an avenue to provide registration of marriage solemnised in any religion. On the other hand, interfaith marriages are solemnised and registered under the Special Marriage Act, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-soon-pass-instructions-on-muslim-marriage-registration/articleshow/86762311.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt, opposition spar over Plus One seats||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition locked horns with the government over the shortage of Plus One seats, for which the allotment process is underway. A similar demand, for increasing the seats, from the ruling bench raised by KK Shailaja came as an icing on the cake for the opposition, which termed it as a genuine grievance of every member, irrespective of the ruling or the opposition benches. But, general education minister V Sivankutty, who assured that every child will be allotted a seat, added that it cannot be ensured that every student will get a seat for the stream of his or her choice. Seeking a leave for adjournment motion, MLA Shafi Parambil raised the matter saying that the government’s approach of uniformly increasing the number of seats for Plus One courses is unscientific, and would result in children being unable to choose the stream or school of their choice. Sivankutty said that compared to the past five years, the number of students who passed SSLC and applied for Plus One course is less. The number of applicants for Plus One is 4,65,219 while the number of students who qualified with full A-Plus is 1,25,509, which is thrice the number compared to previous years. After the first allotment, there are 1,59,840 applications pending and there are 1,92,951 seats left for allotment. After converting reservation seats that are lying vacant after the first allotment as general seats, all students will be ensured seats with the completion of second allotment and spot admission, he said. The minister said that there will be surplus seats after the admission process is completed. He added that given the current financial position of the government, it cannot allot new batches in schools where there is a shortage of seats, but can only increase the seats in existing batches. Then, opposition leader VD Satheesan said the situation in state is such that despite bagging A-Plus in all subjects, students are denied admission to courses of their choice. Mocking the government, he said that if there are excess seats, government should consider allocating them to students from Karnataka or Tamil Nadu. The education minister replied that since Karnataka or Tamil Nadu has not conducted SSLC exams, students from those states will not qualify for admission. Satheesan countered that government cannot deny seats to students from CBSE or ICSE syllabus even if they are from Karnataka or TN, even though the boards did not conduct exams and the minister should know these things before making statements. He said that with the government’s current approach, those students, who will have to depend on open schools, will be three times higher than last year and the government, which boasts of strengthening general education in public sector, is promoting private sector management seats that are taking huge donations even for Plus One seats. The opposition later staged a walk out after speaker M B Rajesh denied the leave for adjournment motion on the basis of the minister’s reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-oppn-spar-over-plus-one-seats/articleshow/86761593.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Lesson learnt, Kolkata's New Town plans daily litter clean-up||KOLKATA: In an attempt to strengthen the waste-collection system, keeping in mind the recent waterlogging issues in New Town where drainage lines were found to be choked with waste, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has planned to engage about 30 workers to collect litter daily. The workers will be divided into three groups of 10 and will collect daily generated litter and clean the three Action Areas in New Town. “We are trying to take a new approach, engaging agencies according to areas for cleaning and waste disposal, keeping up with the green-andclean city theme,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Each of the three groups of cleaners will be provided with two cycle vans for the job. The agencies will be appointed for a year to look after the township’s daily waste clean-up. Residents have welcomed the plan. During the recent waterlogging, several kilograms of plastic and other waste were found dumped on the road sides, choking the drainage lines. The clogged drains had led to the inundation persisting for days, causing various problems for locals, including keeping them confined indoors. “This will be very helpful for the township. About 2,000kg of waste was found choking the entire drainage outlet of Shukhobrishti housing complex during the recent rain and subsequent waterlogging. Cleaning the daily generated litter from the roads will be a smart move by the authorities to keep New Town free of waterlogging in case of more rain,” said Mainak Kanrar, a resident of Shukhobrishti, which was one of the worst-hit complexes during the recent waterlogging. “This will be a game changer. The main reason the drainage lines are getting clogged is the solid waste dumped by hawkers and others. We will be able to see a clean New Town if this is addressed properly,” said Sameer Sharma, a resident of DLF Heights New Town. “Instead of cleaning big chunks of garbage at intervals, a daily clean-up system will help. But continuity needs to be ensured,” said Kingshuk Chakraborty, a resident of Greenfield Ambition housing complex. “Even garbage from outside New Town is dumped here at times. It is necessary to have such an Action Area-wise waste collection system,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News, an umbrella organisation of residents’ forums. The authorities are also inviting agencies to collect nonrecyclable and non-biodegradable waste, like thermocol, foam materials, melamine and plastic bottles, which are stored at the NKDA Patharghata stack yard at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lesson-learnt-new-town-plans-daily-litter-clean-up/articleshow/86761578.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Kolkata||Stretch flooded a week after rain, sparks dengue fear||Kolkata: A stretch behind the fair ground inside Salt Lake’s Central Park was found to be under ankle-deep water on Monday, seven days since heavy rain. The stagnant water in the relatively less-accessed pocket has now sparked fear of vector-borne diseases. The stretch behind the fair ground is used as an access way from the parking lot to the thoroughfare. With few people using it now, the fact that it was still inundated had not come to the notice of the civic body. “I had gone to the mela ground on Sunday evening and was about to park my car on the stretch when I noticed it was still waterlogged, even a week after the deluge. With fear of dengue looming large, I hope the civic authorities will take immediate note of the matter and arrange to drain the water,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB Block. TOI on Monday also found stagnant water inside the fountains in front of the fair ground. “The water has been there for some time. These are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes and should be removed,” said a local. When asked, civic authorities said they will drain the stagnant water from the stretch. Officials said it has to be seen whether there was a problem with the drainage line at the place. According to latest figures available with the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, the number of persons affected by dengue till the end of September was below 10. “We have been taking all steps to prevent mosquito-borne diseases and have kept an eye out for stagnant water on rooftops,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. BMC has been cleaning vacant plots to prevent water accumulation. Officials said in some cases, workers conducting door-to-door checks for stagnant water were being stopped from entering. “We urge residents to cooperate with civic workers,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stretch-flooded-a-week-after-rain-sparks-dengue-fear/articleshow/86761600.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The accused, the police said, was inebriated and made lewd comments on the complainant. When the woman tried to walk away, the man allegedly followed and harassed her, the police added. A case under IPC sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 354D (stalking) was registered at Manesar police station on the complaint of the woman. Manesar station house officer (SHO) inspector Pankaj Kumar said the accused was arrested and produced before a local court that sent him to judicial custody on Monday. In her complaint, the woman, a native of Uttar Pradesh who also works at a private firm in Manesar, said she was sitting outside her paying guest accommodation with two other colleagues on October 2 when the accused, in an inebriated state, walked towards them and made foul comments. The woman claimed that she had initially tried to ignore the accused and tried to walk away. The accused, the complainant claimed, then started to chase them while continuing to make lewd remarks. When she resisted, the accused molested her, the complaint states. In a separate incident, a shopkeeper from the Bajghera area was booked for allegedly molesting a woman. The woman, in her complaint, said that she was going to dump cow dung on an open plot on October 1 when the accused intercepted and dragged her inside his shop. The accused molested the woman and when she resisted he threatened to kill her, police said, adding that a case has been registered under section 354A (sexual harassment) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC after the woman submitted a complaint at the Bajghera police station. “The matter is under investigation and action will be taken against the accused on completion of the probe,” police spokesperson Subhash Boken said.

Earlier, CPM had cautioned its cadres against this in a report prepared by the party state committee. However, the chief minister disowned this in the assembly. In a reply to Shafi Parambil of Congress in the House, the chief minister said that no such reports were given by the intelligence to the government. “There has been no such attempt to lure girl students to extremism on the campuses. The government has not received any such reports from the intelligence wing,” said the chief minister. Parambil had asked whether this had come to the notice of the government and whether any probe was ordered into this. To this, the chief minister said since there were no such reports, there was no need for any probe into this. Earlier in September, in a note circulated to all branch committees, CPM had warned that there is a conscious attempt to lure educated young women into the path of terrorism in professional colleges in the state. It said that “efforts are being made to lure the youth into communalism and extremism.” This note was prepared ahead of the branch committee meetings and the party had said that it had nothing to do with the controversial remark made by the Pala bishop on ‘narcotic jihad’. This remark was added in the party note “Minority Communalism” prepared by the party for its leaders in connection with the inaugural address at the branch and local committee conferences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-report-of-youths-lured-into-extremism-on-campuses-/articleshow/86761612.cms||---

---||Pune||Thunderstorms trigger spells of intense rain across Pune||PUNE: Active thunder clouds over the Pune region on Monday evening caused intense rain spells in most parts of the city, resulting in waterlogging at chronic spots, power cuts and traffic snarls. The first spell of heavy rain started in areas such as Kothrud and Deccan Gymkhana around 5.30pm and slowed down for a while. The rains resumed around 7pm and continued for 40 minutes. While the quantum of rain was being recorded till the time of going to press, Shivajinagar recorded 26.3mm in just over half-an-hour. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, India Meteorological Department, Pune, said since the upcoming showers over the next few days would be of a convective nature, rainfall amounts were likely to differ from one area to another. “For instance, a small cell of cumulonimbus clouds over one area in the city may cause light rain. But a bigger cell of these clouds can cause moderate rain,” he said. Meteorologist J R Kulkarni said 26.3mm rain in half-an-hour to 45 minutes is considered intense. “This is in contrast to monsoon rainfall, which is usually spread over the day, say 10mm in a 24-hour period. Such convective rain spells are characteristic to the formation of cumulonimbus clouds over the areas of influence,” he added. The IMD has forecast partly cloudy skies (becoming generally cloudy towards afternoon/evening), thundery activity, lightning and moderate rain in the city till October 8. Monday evening experienced similar weather conditions with thunderous activity and intense rain. The day temperature in Shivajinagar on Monday was a high 34.2ºC with 73% relative humidity, which caused the convective rain in the evening. Areas such as Shivajinagar, NIBM Road, Kothrud, Pashan, Kalyaninagar, Camp, Sahakarnagar, Warje, Kothrud, Karvenagar and Bavdhan witnessed intense thunder and lightning, followed by sharp rain spells. In Shivajinagar, the rain began around 7:30pm and continued for some time. The rain triggered traffic snarls on Karve Road, Paud Road and the bylanes of Karvenagar and Bavdhan areas. Major traffic congestion was also reported near Chandani Chowk. Areas such as NIBM Road, Undri, Shastrinagar, Karve statue, Vanaz corner and parts of Karvenagar witnessed waterlogging. Many areas like Wanowrie faced hours of power cuts, while residents also faced issues with the internet and mobile networks. Within half-an-hour of the downpour, many roads and bylanes in the Salunke Vihar Road and Kondhwa areas were waterlogged. Roads in Camp, Swargate, Anandnagar on Sinhagad Road and Vadgaon were inundated in the night. The subway leading to Pune railway station was also submerged after the sharp spells. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol tweeted in the evening, “Considering the intense rain in Pune city, appropriate instructions have been given to the disaster management department. All systems are ready. I myself am keeping a close eye on the situation. Get home as soon as you can and avoid going out if you’re at home!” The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has prepared quick response teams to attend to any calls about flash floods, with 150 people kept on the field. The teams will coordinate with 15 ward offices. Special teams have been deployed for night duty. “Besides the chronic spots, special attention has been given to areas such as Ambil Odha, where flash floods were witnessed a couple of years ago,” said Madhav Jagtap, a senior official of the PMC’s disaster management department. Corporator Yogesh Sasane from Hadapsar said workers were monitoring the situation till late night. Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole said the disaster management system was put on alert and the situation was being monitored continuously. The incessant rain, according to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), resulted in power supply outage in areas such as NIBM Road, Katraj, Wanowrie, Wadgaonsheri and Sasanenagar. Nishikant Raut, public relations officer of MSEDCL, Pune, told TOI that the power company had to keep some small feeder pillars closed due to waterlogging, while there were some incidents of trees falling on the low tension lines as well. “By 9.30pm, we had restored 95% power supply in the affected areas,” he said. The city fire brigade received four calls of trees getting uprooted and falling in the Gultekdi, Vishrantwadi and Sinhagad Road areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thunder-storms-trigger-spells-of-intense-rain-across-city/articleshow/86761611.cms||---

Time and again, young men of this community have left comfort zones and sought their fortunes in perilous endeavours. Often with more plans and ideas in their minds than with money in their pockets. Armed only with the steel of their resolve and the dreams in their hearts. And more often than not, they succeeded. And in their success, they carried India towards greater prosperity, becoming the backbone of the nation’s business.

Cutting across sectors and turnover sizes, TOI’s coverage of the community will range from traditional businesses such as gems & jewellery, handicrafts, education and real estate to new age areas such as renewable energy, tech-based start-ups, micro finance and healthcare. We will go beyond established names and bring you the story of those who have fought disruption, especially in times such as the pandemic, and kept their business going with innovation and enterprise. Speaking on the initiative, state Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said, “It's really nice to know that The Times of India is launching a new initiative on how the gennext has built on their family businesses and expanded footprint by diversification, deploying new-age technologies, and using modern day marketing strategies.

Six Punjab MLAs as well as deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, meanwhile, sat on dharna at UP-Punjab border near Saharanpur after they were stopped from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri. Motorcade of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary, however, managed to break through police barricading at Garh Mukteshwar in Hapur and left for Lakhimpur Kheri. Three Congress MLAs from Rajasthan, including Chetan Singh, were detained for two hours by Agra police while trying to reach Lakhimpur. They were later escorted outside the state borders. As politicians kept trying to troop in, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait warned members of the BJP against visiting villages in the region. “I have appealed to residents not to invite any MP or MLA from the BJP in their villages. It is better for these leaders to abstain from visiting or they themselves will be responsible for any untoward incident.” Farmers sat on dharna across all districts of west UP, including Meerut, Agra, Shamli, Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar, blocking several highways. A large number partially blocked the Mant toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway in Mathura and demanded imposition of President's rule in UP. Superintendent of police (rural) Shireesh Chandra told TOI that vehicles passing through the toll from Noida to Agra had to go at a slow pace as not all toll lanes were operational due to the protests. The Rampur-Rudrapur highway was blocked for several hours, leading to traffic jams on the stretch. Hundreds of farmers were seen leaving in private vehicles for Lakhimpur Kheri from Bulandshahr while in Shamli they lay down on roads, challenging authorities to mow them down. In Meerut, they locked the district magistrate’s office and sat in protest. Farmers in Agra alleged that as many as 500 of them were detained in their homes to stop them from participating in protests. BKU Agra division president Gajendra Singh Parihar said, “We had plans to protest at district headquarters but over 500 farmers were detained in their homes.” Farmer leader Sardar B M Singh was also detained in Hapur and taken to a government guest house. Several memorandums were submitted to respective authorities by district-level BKU presidents. Protestors in Agra submitted a memorandum addressed to the President of India, demanding resignation of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni. They also demanded that Teni’s son be arrested within 10 days. “If he is not held, we will launch an indefinite strike,” said BKU Agra district president, Rajveer Lawaniya. Another memorandum submitted to the President of India through Mathura administration demanded dismissal of the state government “on account of total collapse of law and order”. In Aligarh, Samajwadi Party workers burnt the effigy of CM Yogi Adityanath and demanded an inquiry into Sunday’s violence from a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. Farmers are demanding government jobs as well as Rs 1 crore ex-gratia for kin of the deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-demand-prez-rule-block-highways-pun-mlas-on-dharna-at-up-border/articleshow/86760861.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Case against 2 for fraud in name of the President||T’puram: The state police have registered a case against two persons who had produced an order in the name of President Ram Nath Kovind addressed to Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) CMD B Ashok, ordering KTDFC to return the documents of a property that was pledged with it and refund the Rs 1.27 crore he had paid to the corporation. On the basis of the complaint from Ashok to DGP Anil Kant, Museum police registered a complaint under IPC Sections 465, 468, 471 and 34. “We have registered a case against those named in the complaint. A detailed probe will be conducted and further action will follow,” said city police commissioner Balram Kumar Upadhyaya. IPC sections 465, 468 and 471 deal with forgery, creating forged records and using them for fraudulent purposes that would invite imprisonment for up to seven years. In his petition, Ashok had said that two individuals, Saleem M Kabeer, MD of Grandtech Builders and Developers in the capital, and PPM Ashraf, are responsible for the purportedly forged documents in the name of the President, obtained in favour of the builder. As per the complaint, Kabeer, who had availed a loan of Rs 10 crore from KTDFC, produced a document and claimed it to be a decree issued by the President’s Secretariat. The document said that till the directives are complied with, KTDFC should not initiate action against the company or securities, and if action is taken, the President would exercise doctrine of pleasure against the managing director of KTDFC. Meanwhile, more incidents of production of orders in the name of the President surfaced. In another case, Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC) received a similar order in the name of its CMD Sanjay M Kaul that was produced by a Thiruvananthapuram native who is a debtor of KFC, directing the corporation to ‘exclude usurious penal interest and reduce the interest rate to 7% per annum and provide an extended repayment period of 18 years with a consequential subtraction in monthly instalments’, failing which action will be taken against the CMD. The order is in the same format of the order produced before Ashok, with minor changes to suit the particular case and organization. There were reports that a Kannur native had also produced a similar order before Kannur corporation, when it had served him a notice citing violation of building rules in his construction. Legal experts said the matter should be treated with due seriousness and action should be taken against those producing such orders. “This is an outright forgery, a non-bailable and a cognizable offence.... It is also one of the most-preposterous and foolhardy forgery that one can think of, to issue an order in the name of the President... This is a serious matter and whoever has done this should be dealt with severely,” said former law secretary BG Harindranath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/case-against-2-for-fraud-in-name-of-the-president/articleshow/86761639.cms||KP Saikiran

Shinde made the announcement following a survey and finalising stretches of vacant government land in Uran, JNPT, Kharegaon, Sonale, Dapodi and Dapcheri in Palghar on Thursday. Shinde said he has told the local administration to build temporary termini and parking bays at the designated spots. Heavy traffic will be regulated and allowed to move in batches and cross Thane city between 11pm and 6am, he said. The idea is to avoid heavy vehicles plying between JNPT and Gujarat and passing via Thane from causing jams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumba-truck-termini-at-6-spots-to-decongest-roads-in-thane/articleshow/86762838.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Delhi||Diabetes, steroid overuse fuelled fungal infection||NEW DELHI: Steroids have to be used rationally in Covid-19 patients to reduce the risk of mucormycosis, popularly called black fungus infection, if there is a third wave. Dr Ravi Meher, professor in Lok Nayak Hospital’s ENT division, also told TOI on Monday that diabetes patients needed to take extra precautions because mucormycosis was common among diabetics. Meher said that Lok Nayak Hospital, declared a full Covid facility after the emergence of the infection in April last year, had treated more than 21,000 infected patients during the first and second waves of the pandemic. Among them were 350 individuals who developed mucormycosis, an opportunistic fungal infection affecting chiefly the eye, nose and the brain. According to a study published by the hospital in the online edition of American Journal of Otolaryngology, a total of 131 patients were confirmed to have mucormycosis between May 21 and June 30 alone during the second wave. Of them, 101 known diabetics. Out of the remaining 30, who had no previous history of diabetes when investigated, 23 were found to have raised blood sugars in the diabetic range and hence were included in the newly diagnosed Diabetes mellitus category. Steroid was administered to 67 Covid-infected patients who developed mucormycosis. “Covid itself causes immune dysregulation which predispose to fungal infections but in combination with diabetes mellitus the risk increases many folds,” the doctors pointed out in their research. They added, “Strict blood sugar control, early anti-fungal administration and prompt surgical intervention do reduce the mortality and improve survival outcome as seen in this study which is our ultimate goal.” The Lok Nayak doctors said they did not find any significant role of oxygen therapy or ICU admission as an etiological factor for the fungal infection. Mucormycosis is a deadly disease and its management involves the administration of expensive drugs such as Liposomal Amphotericin B, Posaconazole and Voriconazole. In many cases, surgery is also required to prevent the spread of infection. The doctors said several of the patients admitted in Lok Nayak with the fungal infection lost one of the eyes and a few even died despite all medical efforts. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital, said that a meeting was held with leading doctors recently to discuss ways to prevent complications associated with Covid management and one of the suggestions was to control the sale of steroids. “It is an emergency drug and we felt that the steroids shouldn’t be available over-the-counter,” said Kumar. “It should be given only on prescription to prevent the misuse and, therefore, reduce the risks of complications caused by the overuse of steroids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/diabetes-steroid-overuse-fuelled-fungal-infection/articleshow/86761637.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Six held for killing Dausa woman working in Delhi||JAIPUR: Chomu police on Monday arrested six men who allegedly strangulated a 50-yearold woman working in electricity department of New Delhi. Her body was then and dumped on the national highway (NH52) so that vehicles could run over her and no one could identify her. DCP (West) Pradeep Mohan Sharma said the chief accused in the murder of Gulab Devi is her live-in partner Babu Lal Meena who plotted it after he discovered that Devi was planning to hand over a substantial amount of her property to her nephew. “Gulab Devi was a native of Dausa district. Her husband worked in the power department in New Delhi and died in 1994 following which she got the job in the same department on compassionate grounds. Her son committed suicide last year,” Sharma said. Following the death of her husband, Devi met Meena and they began living together and purchased properties in New Delhi. He made three attempts but fumbled at the last minute. Finally, on September 29, Meena took the help of other accomplices and strangulated her near the Morija flyover. ACP (Chomu) Rajendra Singh said the accused had dumped the body in the middle of the highway, hoping that vehicles were run over her and the police will list the case as an accidental death. However, when SHO Hemraj Singh arrived at the scene, he found some documents near the body. One document allegedly blamed her brothers for her son’s death. “There was something amiss. It all looked staged, including the letters,” he said. Singh said that the accused were identified as Babulal Meena, Jagram Meena, Hari Om Meena, Rohitash Meena, Sunil Kumar Meena and Bhupendra Sain alias Babbad. Rajendra Singh said Babu Lal Meen had promised Rs 2 lakh to other accused for helping him in killing Gulab Devi. During interrogation, Babu Lal claimed that he had married Gulab Devi sometime in 2011. Police, however, are yet to verify his claims of marriage to the victim. They purchased a flat for Rs 17 lakh. But for the past two months, she was planning to leave him and adopt her nephew. The accused thought that he would lose everything and killed her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chomu-police-arrest-6-for-killing-delhi-based-woman/articleshow/86761635.cms||---
---||Goa||Focus now is to ensure that more young players make it to the FC Goa first team: Juan Ferrando||Panaji: FC Goa have many positives to pick from their Durand Cup winning campaign. The tournament came at the right time during pre-season for Juan Ferrando. He landed in Kolkata with a strong squad that included four foreigners. But the Goa coach made sure the youngsters were not ignored. The mix of youth and experience worked well as Goa remained undefeated in six games, a confidence booster ahead of next month’s Indian Super League. “Now we are working with the team. All the time I explain, for me most important is to work with the team and don’t talk about foreign, local or young players. We have a team at the end to improve together,” Ferrando said during an online media interaction on Tuesday. Several youngsters made their debuts for Goa like Christy Davis, Papuia and most notably 19-year-old Muhammed Nemil who scored two beautiful goals from his total four in the tournament. “My target, step by step, is to see young players who can help and participate in the first team,” said Ferrando. “Also, the level of the local players will be better and also the foreign players will help the rest of the team. Success is when everybody wants to do and be the best for the team.” When Ferrando took charge last season, Goa were rebuilding their side after several key departures. They stayed true to their style and philosophy, but succumbed to the might of Mumbai City FC in the semi-finals. Ferrando feels he is better prepared this season to help Goa clinch their maiden ISL title after two failed attempts. “Nemil is perfect to play in the ISL but when there is injury, Christy is equally ready. For me, this is the success for the club,” said Ferrando. The 40-year-old is looking beyond domestic tournaments given the team’s success at the AFC Champions League last season, where they finished third in their group which included Iranian champions Persepolis, Qatar heavyweights Al Rayyan and UAE’s Al Wahda. “The last season in (AFC) Champions League was a great experience and I hope the future of this club is to participate in international cups because season by season the club will improve in difficult tournaments,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/focus-now-is-to-ensure-that-more-young-players-make-it-to-the-fc-goa-first-team-juan-ferrando/articleshow/86793893.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Ahmedabad||Floating restaurant idea fished out again||Ahmedabad: Since 2009, the idea of a floating restaurant has been like a capsized dream. After numerous unsuccessful attempts, Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) has called for another expression of interest (EOI) from private companies and individuals. Since 2009, a series of expressions of interest and tenders, almost seven, have been issued. But no company came forward to operate the restaurant. Private players avoided the project on the grounds that SRFDCL assured water availability for just 10 months. Fresh Narmada water is let into the riverfront stretch infrequently. There was also the issue of illegal drains emptying into the riverfront waters. “Earlier, due to water scarcity, levels on the Sabarmati riverfront could not be maintained across the year,” said an official. “The firms that had expressed interest in the project wanted an assurance from the civic authorities about maintaining sufficient water levels so that the restaurant can be operated without hindrance.” The official added that now with the seaplane project coming up, water levels will be maintained making it feasible for restaurant operators. “We have invited tenders for this project and are positive that it will materialize this time,” the official said. The tender issued by SRFDCL inviting expressions of interest mentions the provision of a high-end boat with a capacity of 100 passengers including crew. The vessel with a length of 50 metres and width of 10 metres has to have a flat bottom and twin propulsion system with a minimum draft of 1.5 metres, and a kitchen and a ticket window. “The firm will also have to build a floating jetty for the project. Earlier, SRFDCL was to build the jetty for the operator,” said the official. In the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2017, the Gujarat tourism department had showcased this project estimating its cost at Rs 25.5 crore which included a vessel, the creation of support infrastructure, salaries of crew, and operational costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/floating-restaurant-idea-fished-out-again/articleshow/86761672.cms||---
---||Delhi||Engr murder: NHAI seeks to bar Ggn firm from bidding||New Delhi: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has issued a showcause notice to E-5 Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, asking the Gurgaon-based construction company to respond why it should not be blacklisted and its contract not be terminated after its managing director was arrested last month for the alleged murder of an ‘authority engineer’ in Jaipur. The NHAI appoints authority engineers for supervising and monitoring works, which are fully funded by the government. Once blacklisted, a firm cannot participate in any bidding process for a specific period. Sources said NHAI issued the notice last week and has set a deadline for the company to send its response. “After getting their response we will decide the next course of action. Every step is being taken considering the legal aspects,” said an highway authority official. Last month, the NHAI executive committee headed by its chairman had taken the decision to send a strong message to the industry by taking exemplery action against E-5 Infrastructure. The highways authority has considered all legal aspects before serving the notice as the matter is now before the court. The murder of 63-year-old Rajendra Chawla and arrest of five persons including E-5 Infrastructure’s MD had sent shockwaves across the construction industry. Police had claimed that the main accused had developed animosity towards Chawla after he had refused to approve a design prepared by the company for foot overbridges on the Gurgaon-Jaipur highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/engr-murder-nhai-seeks-to-bar-ggn-firm-from-bidding/articleshow/86761660.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Ahmedabad||Aryan Khan drug case: Gujarat NCB team to ‘assist’||AHMEDABAD: A team of Gujarat Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is all set to assist their counterparts in Mumbai in the case of seizure of drugs in a cruise party where Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was also arrested for possessing drugs on October 3. A senior officer of Gujarat zonal unit of NCB said, “The case is very high-profile as it has names of various big shots. It is important to find out the exact channel from where the drugs were supplied. Even earlier, our help was taken in various high-profile cases including one involving Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty. We are all likely to join this inquiry too.” The officer said that they will assist their Mumbai counterparts with needed manpower as and when required in the case. It needs mention that Gujarat has become a transit route for entry of drugs into the country due to its long sea route. Also, it has recently reported the biggest seizure of around 3,000 kgsof heroin from Mundra port in Kutch. “There are certain cases in recent past where drug carriers either caught from city airport or railway station were supposed to go to Mumbai. So, it cannot be ruled out that the drugs which was supplied to the rave party in the cruise involving the actor’s son would not have any links to Gujarat,” said the officer. The officer said that it has been established in the Aryan Khan case that the dark web was used for supplying of drugs and crypto currency was used for payment. “The use of dark web has increased amongst peddlers from Nigeria and South Africa and also amongst local drug mafia. They do this to avoid being traced by the cops and agency personnel,” he said. Khan was arrested by the NCB on October 3, along with others for allegedly possessing drugs. According to the arrest memo, 13 grams of cocaine, five gram of MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of Ecstasy and Rs 1.33 lakh cash was seized from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-ncb-team-to-assist/articleshow/86761658.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CM: No need to hold meeting of religious heads||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the assembly that there was no need for convening a meeting of the religious and community heads to ensure communal harmony in the state. “There are no such circumstances prevailing in the state to have such a meeting,” he said. He was replying to a question raised by the opposition members on the need for convening a meeting of religious heads to restore communal harmony that has been allegedly upset by the ‘narcotic jihad’ remark made by Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt. The chief minister said that no issue had been raised to instigate hatred and discord among various religious communities in the state. But there are some media reports that there has been an attempt to create communal hatred in society. The statement by the chief minister in the assembly contradicts the stand he had taken earlier when the narcotic jihad statement had come from the Pala bishop. He had then said that narcotics were a social evil and it had nothing to do with religion. UDF has been demanding a meeting of the religious heads after the remarks from the Pala bishop. The chief minister had then said that such a demand could be considered. However, the chief minister turned down the demand for convening an all-party meet raised by UDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-no-need-to-hold-meeting-of-religious-heads/articleshow/86761653.cms||---

A bench of Justice Jaspreet Singh passed the directives on a writ petition filed by the parents against the order issued by an additional district judge (ADJ) on October 20, 2020, whereby he had set aside the order of the court of civil judge (junior judge) Hawali which on December 7, 2019, had given protection to the old couple from eviction. Allowing the petition filed against the order of ADJ, the bench said, “The order of injunction issued by the court of civil judge on December 7, 2019, is restored with the condition that the petitioners (couple) shall pay the monthly charges for their occupation in the old age home inclusive of the charges for the meals and electricity at a tentative rate of Rs.12,000 per month for both the petitioners, payable at the end of the every month to the respondents by a cheque for which the management shall issue a receipt and the amount so paid shall be subject to the final determination to be made in this regard by the civil judge who shall ascertain the amount payable by the petitioners to the management towards room, electricity and meals charges for the period of their stay.” The parents were forsaken by their own children in 2016. They, hence, approached Samarpan old age home to take shelter. As a requirement, they deposited Rs 75,000 as security money and agreed to pay monthly charges against their stay in room number 108 of the home. Later, in 2019, the parents moved the civil court pleading that the management of the home was adamant to evict them illegally. The management, however, pleaded the bad behaviour of the old couple, especially the woman inmate, for the reason as to why it wanted to evict them. The management also stated that the couple had three daughters who are residing in the city itself and as such they can live with them. The civil judge had granted protection to the parents, but in appeal the ADJ set aside the civil judge’s order. Now, the high court has restored the order of the civil judge with certain additional directions for the civil judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-abandoned-couple/articleshow/86762389.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Candidates in Kolkata vacate ‘unwanted’ UG seats during seven-day extension||KOLKATA: The seven-day extension for undergraduate admissions that the state higher education department has granted is helping colleges and universities get a clear view of seat demands as candidates who had bagged seats in multiple colleges are finally making their choice. With institutes introducing wish lists and first-comefirst-served spot entrance, multiple seats are being vacated as candidates have started cancelling admissions they had taken in multiple colleges. A senior academic also cited another reason for the dropouts. “This year’s admissions have been pushed back due to Covid. After the publication of all-India-based competitive results, several students are leaving for professional courses, cancelling their college seats here,” he said. Colleges have reported multiple vacancies in Bengali, Sanskrit, philosophy and Hindi, where the pace of admissions has rather slow. While Bethune College invited application forms for subjects, like Sanskrit and philosophy, for all categories and some other subjects for reserved categories, Scottish Church received new applications for philosophy, Sanskrit and Bengali till October 2. Scottish Church principal Madhumanjari Mandal said, “Date extension is helping us to fill the vacant seats but at the same time, we are noticing that many students are leaving.” Surendra Nath College has issued a notice for first-come-first-served admission. Principal Indranil Kar said, “We have this last option to fill seats, but time is too short to publish a wish list. So we started first-come-first-served admissions from Sunday.” Around 10% seats are still vacant in UG science at Jadavpur University. Jadavpur University Teacher Association (JUTA) general secretary Partha Pratim Roy said, “We used to hold physical counselling, which was more effective than the online process. Online reporting is held on the basis of a certain number of seats, so the process gets delayed.” This year, given the high scores awarded to Plus-II candidates and the deluge of applications, there were fears of even high-scorers missing out on subjects and colleges of their choice, but the reality turend out to be different with many reputable institutes still struggling to fill a sizeable number of seats. A principal said, “Colleges have enough seats to accommodate a large number of students. This time, out of panic, candidates blocked seats in multiple colleges but did not alert the ones they did not finally choose. It’s not mandatory for them to do so either. Central counselling can solve the problem to some extent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-vacate-unwanted-ug-seats-during-7-day-extension/articleshow/86761662.cms||---

In a letter to the Uttar Pradesh Paralympic Committee, a copy of which was also forwarded to the Chief Minister’s office and the sports department, six Tokyo Paralympics participants from UP – Akash, Jyoti, Vivek Chikara, Deepender Singh, Ajit Singh and Varun Singh Bhati – said that they came to know through media reports that the government was planning to give Rs 10 lakh as cash award to players for participation. “The UP government recently gave a cash award of Rs 25 lakh each to the participants of Tokyo Olympics. We request you to kindly raise the issue with the competent authority so that we can also get the cash incentive of Rs 25 lakh,” the letter said. “Equal treatment on the part of the state will further motivate us to engage with more enthusiasm and energy to win medals,” the players added. Talking to TOI, para-high jumper Varun Bhati said there should be no discrimination between para-athletes and able-bodied players. Meanwhile, sports director RP Singh said though there was no official information yet, Tokyo paralympians were likely to be felicitated at a programme in Meerut. Date, venue and other details of the programme would be announced soon, he added. 5 years on, Rio bronze medalist awaits Rs 1cr promised by SP govt Para-athlete Varun Singh Bhati said that he had bagged a bronze medal in the 2016 Rio Paralympics after which the then Samajwadi Party government, led by Akhilesh Yadav, had promised to give him Rs 1 crore as cash award. “Five years have passed but I have not received any money yet,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tokyo-paralympics-participantscall-for-hike-in-cash-award/articleshow/86762404.cms||Fazal Khan
---||Ahmedabad||Self-financed schools in Gujarat want classes 1 to 5 to reopen before Diwali vacation||AHMEDABAD: The Federation of Self- Financed Schools in Gujarat has made a representation to the state government seeking reopening of Classes 1 to 5. The government should look into reopening school for these children before the Diwali vacation, the federation said. While the number of Covid-19 cases is low presently, and experts are ruling out the possibility of a third wave, it is safe to allow reopening of schools for Classes 1 to 5, the association said in a written representation to state education secretary Vinod Rao. The vaccination drive has also been very successful, covering a large number of people and the risk to children of getting infected with Covid-19 is also very low, it said. Schools should be allowed to reopen before the Diwali vacation so the second term can start in a smooth manner after the holiday period. In a separate letter, the federation said that self-financed schools should be allowed to hold unit tests according to their own time-table and not as set in the government’s schedule. The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board released a time-table for all schools in Gujarat to conduct exams from October 18 to October 27. According to the government’s schedule, exams for Classes 9 and 11 are to be held from 11am to 1pm while those for Classes 10 and 12 are to be held from 2pm to 5pm. It is difficult for all self-financed schools to hold the exams according to the prescribed schedule and they should be given the flexibility of conducting unit tests at their convenience, said sources in the federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/self-financed-schools-want-classes-1-to-5-to-reopen-before-diwali-vacation/articleshow/86761673.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BSP sets up panel of lawyers to fight case of Lakhimpur Kheri farmers||LUCKNOW: After Bahujan Samaj Party national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra was put under house arrest late Sunday night in Lucknow and prevented from going to Lakhimpur Kheri, the party held a prayer meeting for the four deceased farmers and said it would fight for the deceased and injured farmers. On Monday night, BSP announced setting up a team of senior lawyers for fighting the case of farmers on pro bono basis, and ensuring that the guilty do not get away. The MP’s house arrest continued till Monday night. Mishra, who was scheduled to leave for Lakhimpur on Monday initially, had decided to leave close to midnight, but UP Police did not allow him to proceed, following which party chief Mayawati condemned the state government’s high handedness. “BSP national general secretary SC Mishra was put under house arrest on Sunday so a party delegation could not go to Lakhimpur Kheri and understand what had actually happened there. I condemn this action. Since a BJP minister is involved, a fair investigation does not seem possible. Therefore, a judicial enquiry is must to ensure fair probe and justice for the victims in this incident in which nine people have died,” she said. Sources said cops had moved away from Mishra’s house on Monday night, but there was still a strong police presence on the road. Mishra has to appear before the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court on Tuesday and police is likely to escort him. Several senior party workers reached Mishra’s house and party chief Mayawati is expected to issue a strong statement against the government on October 9, the death anniversary of party founder Kanshiram amid hundreds of party supporters visiting his memorial in Lucknow. Mayawati also issued a statement against Haryana chief minister M L Khattar accusing him of inciting BJP workers. “The instigative speech of Haryana CM, asking BJP workers to pick up rods and lathis to give a befitting reply to protesting farmers is condemnable. A video of his speech telling workers to be ready to go to jail and becoming leaders is viral,” she said. First, the minister of state for home affairs threatened to set the farmers right in two minutes after which eight people lost their lives in the violence. And then, the Haryana CM issued a despicable statement. This proves BJP’s anti-people character, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-sets-up-panel-of-lawyers-to-fight-case-of-kheri-farmers/articleshow/86762414.cms||---
---||Delhi||Candidates give Delhi University run for its seats at 100%||NEW DELHI: The qualifying bar for admission might be a daunting 100%. But many students have the marks to meet even this tough benchmark and have already got or are poised to be admitted into the undergraduate courses in Delhi University’s colleges. At Hindu College, 90 full pointers have applied for political science (H), a number that is more than the seats available for the course. The 100% cutoff for the same course at Ramjas College attracted 16 applicants. At Shri Ram College of Commerce, around 60 max scorers applied for the BCom (H) course and eight for economics (H). At Hansraj College, 23 students with 100% have applied for computer science (H). “I think it was right on our part to fix the cutoff at 100% as we have received a decent number of applications,” said Tanvir Aiejaz, teacher in charge of political science at Ramjas. “Right now, we are at a safe point and cannot afford a big reduction in the cutoff.” Aiejaz said 14 of the 16 full percenters are from the Kerala education board, five from the general category, 10 OBC and one in the EWS category. At SRCC too, most students whose admissions were cleared were from different state boards in south India. Anju Srivastava, principal, Hindu College, said, “We received around 150 applications, out of which 90 were students under various categories with perfect scores. All will be converted automatically to the general category.” No admissions were completed for computer science (H) at the two colleges —Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies —where the cutoff was 100%. Similarly, SGTB Khalsa too hasn’t admitted anyone to the BCom Programme with the bar of 100%. At SRCC, eight admissions were cleared for economics (H). The 60 applicants for BCom (H) comprised 30 from the general category, 29 OBC category and one SC. A college official said, “Even at 100% cutoff, we have received so many applications, indicating that DU should now adopt the common entrance test for undergrad admissions. The board results cannot be relied upon to reflect the capability of the students.” At Hansraj College, of the 23 full pointers who applied for computer science (H), 11 were from the general category and 12 from the OBC, to be converted to general now. Even colleges where the qualifying scores were 99-99.75%, such as Miranda House, Kirori Mal and Sri Venkateswara, many top scorers have applied for admission. Siddharth Lahon, admission convenor at Kirori Mal, said, “We have received several applications from students who have an aggregate of 100% in their Class XII exams. There were many applications for BCom and geography (H) and other courses. While several admissions were approved, some are pending and will be cleared soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/candidates-give-du-run-for-its-seats-at-100/articleshow/86761692.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB gets 3-day custody of Aryan Khan, 7 others in drug bust||MUMBAI: The NCB, in its remand application seeking custody of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s 23-year-old son Aryan Khan and two others, said on Monday it has found links in the form of pictures, chats, etc, on Aryan’s mobile phone pointing to an international drug trafficking chain. Officials claimed in the remand plea they have found “shocking incriminating material” on Khan’s phone. The NCB had arrested eight persons following a raid carried out on a cruise liner on Saturday night. The Esplanade court, after a three-hour hearing, extended the remand of Aryan and the two others in NCB custody till October 7. The Cordelia Cruises ship on which Aryan Khan was partying before the NCB raidIn a separate order, it also granted NCB custody of the five other arrested accused till October 7. The NCB said that in its scrutiny of Aryan’s mobile phone, “there are several suspected characters, whose identification is still to be established by accused Aryan Khan”. The application, parts of which were read out by additional S-G Anil Singh who appeared for NCB, said, “Prima facie, investigation conducted reveals that there is incriminating material in the form of WhatsApp chat etc clearly showing the nexus of these respondents with suppliers and drug peddlers on aregular basis.” NCB wants to confront accused with others over ‘info from Khan’In his order remanding Aryan Khan and two others in NCB custody, the additional chief metropolitan magistrate noted the NCB case against the trio was “of involvement, of consumption, sale and purchase of contraband” and they were “arrested in connection with seizure of 13 gram of cocaine, 5 gram of MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of MDMA and 1.33 lakhs in cash.” The NCB wants to confront the accused with others over the “shocking information from Khan and incriminating material from his phone showing pics (sic) chats pointing towards international supply needs to be investigated,” the order stated. It noted Khan’s counsel Satish Maneshinde said whatever was recovered was from the ship and nothing from Khan. Singh who appeared for NCB with advocates Aditya Thakkar, Shriram Shirsat and Advait Sethna said the chats showing links to an international drug chain may need probing, and NCB may take help from other agencies for its probe. He said arrest of a supplier was made after a fresh raid. “In the raid we found commercial quantities of drugs,” Singh said, adding, “nowadays it has become common to see persons and college students taking drugs. Young people consider these high-profile people as role models. Unless we probe the person doing drugs, how can we find the source of the drugs, the suppliers and financiers to break the racket.” Maneshinde denied the chats brought forth any evidence against Aryan from whom there was no recovery of drugs and said no case was made out for further custody. He added, “Khan has cooperated. Has no criminal antecedents. Has shown his good conduct, not run away. Whatever chats they say when Khan was abroad does not show any link to any international drug chain.” The plea was for a probe for corroboration. “On the basis of intelligence information from the accused, the NCB conducted another raid operation... it is imperative for a thorough investigation that these persons are confronted with each other... The above incriminating material coupled with the leads in the investigation given by these respondents in their voluntary statements, needs to be verified and corroborated. All this in the wake of ongoing investigation, the link has to be verified and corroborated,” said the application heard by dditional CMM R M Nerlikar. Singh cited a 2020 judgement of Bombay HC in actor Rhea Chakraborty’s bail order to submit HC has held all offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are non-bailable, even if the defence may say the offences against the accused are bailable. Maneshinde cited several judgments and orders to argue the court is not without powers to grant bail. In this case, Maneshinde said, “whatever chats they had, NCB had two days to probe. Have they found anything? Nothing they have found against Khan.” For Arbaaz Merchant, 26, Khan’s friend, the co-accused from whom NCB said it recovered 6 gm of charas, his advocate Taraq Sayed said “in most cases NCB comes up with cases of small quantity, for which no further custodial interrogation is needed and say that they are going to unearth a conspiracy.”  Sayed said NCB has to show what is the recovery and what evidence it has against each accused. “Does NCB have any connection between the accused and the alleged recovery from suppliers?” He too said his client has cooperated and further custody is not warranted, as did advocate Ali Kaashif for the third accused Munmun Dhamecha, 39. Kaashif submitted, “She has no connection with Khan and Merchant. She was called on the cruise as a guest. Even her room was booked by another person and no incriminating substance was found on her.” NCB said 5 gm hashish was found on the floor and not in her personal possession, he argued. He said she was hardly in the room for a few minutes when the raid happened. “Investigation is needed for the prosecution and also to prove innocence of accused,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-wants-to-confront-accused-with-others-over-info-from-khan/articleshow/86762862.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolkata||North, central Kolkata homes get turbid water||KOLKATA: The Hooghly water has turned so turbid that it has threatened normal functioning of Palta treatment plant. The KMC on Monday failed to provide usual supply of potable water to large parts of north and central Kolkata as it took inordinately long to filter ‘never-seenbefore turbidity” from the water at the Palta plant before being released for supply. According to a civic water supply department official, those at the plant has been talking about “high turbidity” of the Hooghly water and that if it persisted, it could lead to curtailed supply to the city, much less than its daily requirement. The scenes at the Garden Reach and Dhapa water treatment plants have been similar as water supply engineers at the two facilities have also been struggling with murky water. While Garden Reach supplies potable water to large parts of south Kolkata, including KMC’s added areas, such as Garden Reach, Behala, parts of Tollygunge and Jadavpur, the Dhapa plant caters to residents along EM Bypass. KMC engineers, who visited the Palta plant, found tonnes of mud getting stuck in the intake jetty, which draws millions of gallons of raw water from the Hooghly to be treated and made fit for consumption. According to a senior water supply department official, who went to Palta to oversee the filtration process, the plant engineers were struggling to save the facility from the “murky” factor. “I have never seen such a level of turbidity in the Hooghly near our Palta treatment plant. The entire process of filtration is getting abnormally delayed due to the high presence of mud,” he said, adding this delay could mean supply of less water for a couple of days. This should be a wake-up call before the festive season. The last thing that the city needs now is an outbreak of water-borne diseases. TimesViewThis should be a wake-up call before the festive season. The last thing that the city needs now is an outbreak of water-borne diseases.The KMC water supply department realized their fear was not unfounded when residents in north Kolkata neighbourhoods, such as Ultadanga, Bagmari and Muraripukur, complained about murky water on Sunday morning. Later, complaints of muddy water reached the civic headquarters from several south Kolkata neighbourhoods and EM Bypass as well. Though acting on an advice by KMC doctors, the water supply department did add additional alum to the raw water at Palta, Garden Reach, Dhapa treatment plants and all booster pumping stations, KMC ward coordinators and officials appealed to residents not to drink it before boiling it. Already worried about their health during the pandemic, residents of the affected neighbourhoods seemed wary of drinking the water, despite the extra filtering procedure being taken. “We found muddy water flowing out of municipal taps on Sunday morning. We immediately alerted our local ward coordinator. The water appeared cleaner on Monday but I still find some mud in it. I have decided to buy packaged drinking water till the water becomes fit for consumption,” said Ultadanga Road resident Malay Sinha. Local ward coordinator Pranati Bhattacharya on Monday conceded residents were reluctant to drink water from municipal taps. “As advised by the KMC brass, I have requested residents of Ultadanga Road and Halderbagan to boil water before drinking till the turbidity is removed,” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/north-central-kolkata-homes-get-turbid-water/articleshow/86761670.cms||Saikat Ray

And once they do, their eyes are glued to the blackboard, viewing the beautiful sketches of inspiring great personalities, freedom fighters, and soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation. The credit for arousing the interest of the students of Composite School, Malangpuwva in Bahraich’s Balwa block goes to the science teacher Arun Kumar, who draws sketches of warriors, great personalities, particularly those who fought for India’s freedom, on the blackboard as an innovative method to lure students to attend school regularly. “Five years back, when I had joined this school, hardly any students came to classes. Even those who were enrolled didn’t turn up for classes. I then decided to use art as a tool to attract the kids to the school and bring a social change,” Kumar said. In 2017, Kumar bought a blackboard and practiced drawing different sketches throughout the summer holidays. “The icing on the cake was the chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s decision to keep the schools open on birth anniversaries of great personalities and teach children about them, instead of declaring it a holiday,” he added. Now, students themselves keep track of special dates and look forward to learning more about the famous and inspiring people. Kumar’s sketches on the Independence Day and birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the stories he narrated left the students in awe. “We now eagerly wait to come to the school. Through our teacher’s sketches, we learn about famous personalities and forgotten heroes,” said Momina, a Class VIII student. The students pay their tributes, and the stories inculcate a sense of unity and patriotism in them. “In three years, the number of students enrolled and attending classes has doubled. There were only 60 students in 2017 and not even half of them came to school. Today, there are 150 students, and more than 80% attend school,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-sketches-draw-studentsto-govt-school-enrollment-surges/articleshow/86762413.cms||Isha Jain

This time, a 35-year-old woman from Isanpur received obscene messages of two different IDs on the Zoom application when she was assisting her daughter with her online classes, on June 24. She filed a complaint with cybercrime police on Monday. Earlier, someone sent a threatening email to the authorities of Anand Niketan School in Satellite, demanding that the exams be cancelled. The same accused is presumed to have later posted and circulated obscene images of two girl students. In the case filed on Monday, a teacher of an English medium school in Raikhad filed a complaint with cybercrime police stating that the accused sent the obscene messages to his wife. In the complaint, he said that he teaches in a school and his wife helps their two children — daughter, 7, a student of Class 2, and son, 5, a senior KG student — with their online classes as they cannot properly operate the phone for online classes. “On June 24, 2021, when my wife was helping my daughter with her online classes, some person using two different IDs began sending obscene messages to my wife,” he said in the FIR. He said that his wife took screenshots of the messages that the accused sent between 12.31pm and 12.45pm on June 24 soon after the online class started on Zoom. She sent the screenshots to her husband and they sent them to the principal of Hebron School in Maninagar on June 25. They also submitted an application to the school to look into the matter. The complainant submitted an application to Cybercrime police on June 27. Cybercrime police took over three months to register a case against the person who sent the obscene messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/online-class-obscene-messages-sent-to-mom/articleshow/86761676.cms||---

In her complaint, the woman said that the accused, Ketan Patel, a resident of Ghodasar, visited her house on and off for about five years, as he was her friend. On Sunday at around 5.30pm, Patel came to her house and told her that he wanted to teach her daughter how to drive a scooter. At around 7.30pm on Sunday, he dropped her back at the house after which the girl began crying. When her mother asked her about it, she told her mother that Patel had taken her to an abandoned house in Makarba where he raped her. “He first gave her driving lessons near my house and then made her sit pillion and took her to an abandoned house where he raped her,” she said in the police complaint. She told her mother that Patel told her that she would face dire consequences if she told her mother about what had happened. The woman took the girl to a nearby private hospital where she underwent a medical examination.

The ruling MLAs tried to raise the issue relating to the complaint given by the women members of Haritha against Youth League leaders. However, opposition leader V D Satheesan urged the speaker that there is no precedence in the House allowing political questions during the question hour. The speaker reminded the members about the rules on raising political questions and hence said such questions cannot be allowed. But the LDF members tried to raise the queries between several other questions. This led to a protest from the opposition members. However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who replied to the questions regarding the complaints given by the Haritha leaders, did not even mention the name of Haritha in his reply. “All political parties have equal responsibilities in maintaining gender equality and social justice. It is not just the responsibility of the government alone to ensure this in society. All political parties should also come forward in ensuring gender equality. The political parties have a greater responsibility in this,” he said. Even though the state is at the forefront of ensuring women safety and also in women’s empowerment, there are incidents of atrocities against women, said Vijayan.

---||Lucknow||BJP MP Varun seeks SC-monitoredprobe into Lakhimpur Kheri violence||Lucknow: BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi on Monday termed the Lakhimpur incident in which protesting farmers were killed as “unforgivable” in “any decent civilisation”. In a letter dashed to CM Yogi Adityanath, Varun said that the “entire country” was “enraged” and “pained” by the incident which took place just a day after the country celebrated the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi who was a proponent of non-violence. His apparent hardened stance came close on the heels of a high voltage political slugfest that erupted over the incident between the opposition and the ruling BJP in Lucknow. Seeking a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe into the incident, Varun said that the people involved in the incident should be swiftly identified and booked under Section 302 of the IPC. He also demanded a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the families of the victims and an assurance that no such incident would re-occur in future. The BJP MP said that protesting farmers were citizens of the country. “If they had any apprehensions and were staging a demonstration in a democratic way then it is our duty to exercise restraint and endurance,” Varun said in the letter. He asserted that it was the duty of the government to deal with farmers in a “Gandhian”, “democratic” and “sensitive” manner. “I express my grief for farmers who got killed in the incident,” Varun said. Last month, Varun became one of the few leaders in the party to come out in support of farmers who had gathered in Muzaffarnagar on September 5 in protest of farm laws. “Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood,” he had tweeted, insisting that the government needs to start re-engaging with the farmers in a “respectful” manner, understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground. His tweet came on a day when farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and other states gathered in large numbers for a Mahapanchayat at Muzaffarnagar in West UP. Experts said that Varun’s recent observation vis-a-vis farmers attained much political significance even as the state heads for a high stake assembly election due in the next few months. His statements were seen as a strong pointers towards some of the BJP ranks who were sensing the need to re-start a dialogue with the farmers, staging a raging protest for the past 10 months. Varun’s remarks, sources in the BJP said, were also crucial since he represents Pilibhit which lies in UP’s Terai region and is home to a large number of Punjabi origin farmers. Gandhi’s own maternal family hails from the region. Lakhimpur too has a sizable population of farmers. As a matter of fact, Punjabi origin farmers of the Terai regions of UP, too, have been at the forefront of the protests. Gandhi had also demanded that the State Advisory Price (SAP) for the forthcoming cane crushing season in UP be raised to Rs 400 per quintal. The state government last month increased the SAP by Rs 25 per quintal after keeping the rates unchanged for three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-mp-varun-seeks-sc-monitoredprobe-into-lakhimpur-kheri-violence/articleshow/86762416.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Railway projects go off track for want of funds||AMARAVATI: Fate of several key railway projects is hanging in balance as the state government has expressed its inability to share costs. The government is claiming that a majority of these projects were initiated well before the bifurcation of the state when it had cash reserves. Since the ‘unscientific’ bifurcation has left the state with empty coffers, the state government is insisting on the Centre to bear the entire costs of projects.  The state had come forward to bear the costs of land acquisition required for the continuance of railway projects including those that were listed as priority projects by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had reviewed the progress of the key infrastructure projects directly with the then chief secretary and advised him to put the process on fast track. Despite repeated appeals from the PMO, Union cabinet secretary, and the group of ministers (GoM) on infrastructure projects, the state government is not ready to extend funds as promised earlier. The authorities of Indian railways are in a catch-22 situation on going ahead with the works as majority of the projects are held up halfway. Sources said the state government has to clear nearly Rs 4,000 crore as part of its share for the already commissioned projects in the state. For instance, Nadikudi-Srikalahasti new railway line project was cleared by the Centre in 2010 with an initial estimation of Rs 2,500 crore. The state government had agreed to share 50 per cent of the cost. The project cost has now touched Rs 4,000 crore and the state government is reported to have released just around Rs 60 crore in the last decade. The railway authorities could complete just around 46 km work of the 326-km-long new project.  Similarly, the prestigious Bangalore-Kadapa railway project is also not progressing well due to the inability of the state government to fund the project. The railway authorities could complete just around 22 km work of the 255-km-long project. The state government is said to have remitted just around Rs 15 crore. Another key infrastructure project that has been slowed down is Kotipalli-Narsapur line work. The state government has reportedly paid Rs 3 crore against its share of Rs 722 crore to the railways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/railway-projects-go-off-track-for-want-of-funds/articleshow/86760911.cms||Samdani MN

It has been learnt that he took sanyasa deeksha on the banks of river Godavari in Rajahmundry on April 3 this year and has given up his marital and other worldly comforts. Sivaramakrishna Rao first won the seat in 1978 representing Janata Party, and won again in 1989 on a Congress ticket. Son of Vaddemanu Chidanandam, who also won from Badvel in 1962 as a Swatantra Party candidate, he was a close associate of late YS Rajasekhar Reddy. His political fortunes, however, dipped considerably after the emergence of Bijivemula Veera Reddy. Veera Reddy, who won Badvel twice on a Congress ticket, moved to TDP in 1985 and won three more times. He was a cabinet minister in Chandrababu Naidu government and died of heart attack in December 2000. When the by-election was held for the seat in 2001 after his death, Sivaramakrishna Rao lost to Veera Reddy’s daughter K Vijayamma. He stayed loyal to the Congress and shouldered the party’s responsibilities in Badvel while being in opposition. After YSR formed the government in then united Andhra Pradesh in 2004, Sivaramakrishna Rao was made chairman of state health mission (Vaidya Vidhana Parishad). He left active politics following YSR’s death in 2009. After taking sanyasa deeksha, he has changed his name to Swami Sivarama Ananda Saraswathi and has been leading a spiritual life. His wife Girija and son Srinivas Chidananda Kumar stay in regular touch with him and looking after his requirements. It has been learnt that he took sanyasa deeksha on the banks of river Godavari in Rajahmundry on April 3 this year and has given up his marital and other worldly comforts||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/2-time-badvel-mla-takes-a-spiritual-plunge/articleshow/86760931.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Lucknow||Unsure about situation back home, Afghan students join new Lucknow University courses||LUCKNOW: Eight Afghan students, who have recently completed their postgraduate courses at Lucknow University, will continue to pursue their higher education at the varsity rather than going back to their country as they fear that the new Taliban-led government will not give them the liberty to pursue their career. Also, since parents of most of the Afghan students have been associated with the previous government, they fear retaliation from the current regime. To avoid conflict with the hardliner conservative regime, the students got enrolled in doctoral courses soon after they finished the ones for which they had come to India. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) has approved their fellowships. “Eight students enrolled at the PG level will now be pursuing doctoral studies for which they will get a fellowship for the next five years, hostel fees and the course fees from the council,” said the director of international collaboration, international student advisor Prof RP Singh. Also, the students are planning to call their family members here till the situation improves back home. “I hail from Kabul and visited my home four months back when our country was at peace. I completed my MA (Economics) from LU but can't go back for security reasons now. I am happy that I have got the scholarship to pursue doctoral studies from LU,” said PhD (economics) student Shekib Lodin. He said all Afghani students had to change their career plans due to the chaotic situation in their country. “I want to become a lecturer and would love to teach at any university in India and if the situation calms down at my place I can work there as well. But for now, I will focus on my research work and I am planning to call my family here once the international flights from Afghanistan are revived and visa issues are settled,” he added. Another student, Ahmad Iqbal Ghafoori, who did his MSc (renewable energy) from LU and is now in PhD also shared similar thoughts. “I want to make my career in renewable energy and now I might end up setting up my own business related to the field but not sure where and when,” said Ahmad Iqbal Ghafoori. He said he had not visited his home for more than one year and now I will be here pursuing research for the next few years. “I want my family to come down and stay with me here till the time our country is at peace,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/unsure-about-situation-back-home-afghani-students-join-new-courses-in-lu/articleshow/86762418.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Lucknow||Stopped in Sitapur, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra dares police to produce warrant or arrest her||LUCKNOW: Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra defied police cordon in Lucknow to head off towards Lakhimpur late on Sunday night. She managed to reach Sitapur before she could be stopped. A fiery Priyanaka took on the cops for stopping her in Lucknow and Sitapur. Citing provisions of the law, she demanded an arrest warrant to be produced and dared police to formally arrest her. Making her sit inside any police vehicle without these, she said, would amount to kidnapping and assault. Gandhi confronting cops on Sunday night“Where is the order? Show it to me...how can you stop me if you have no order to show,” she asked police officers, who had arranged for her to be restricted to Kaul House, her residence in Lucknow, on Sunday night after she arrived by flight from Delhi. From there, within minutes, she dodged police and sneaked out of the bungalow. Police took help of cellular phone data to track her on National Highway 24, connecting Lucknow with Lakhimpur via Sitapur. Anticipating that police might stall her at Khairabad toll booth, she detoured from Sidhauli and towards Hargaon to take the road to Lakhimpur Kheri 22km away. Despite this, police intercepted her in Hargaon where she dared them again as they reportedly manhandled her. “Don’t think that I do not understand your designs. The way you are behaving invites legal action...this amounts to attempt to molest, physical assault, attempt to kidnap and harm under the law. Show me the warrant. Learn to talk to women,” she warned the officials. Videos of the argument are doing rounds on social media. From Hargaon though, she was taken to Sitapur to a government guest house. While in detention there, Priyanka took to Gandhigiri and decided to sweep the floor of her room. By heading towards Lakhimpur at night itself, she also stumped the SP and BSP leadership who had announced to head for Lakhimpur on Monday morning. Though Priyanka was not freed till late evening, she continued to voice her opinion through social media. “The Lakhimpur incident shows the extent to which the BJP government can go to lay atrocities on farmers. We will not let their voice be suppressed. The anti-farmer plans of the BJP government will not be allowed to succeed,” she tweeted. Holding the Union minister of state for home and his son responsible for the political tension in Lakhimpur, Priyanka said: “Why is the BJP government protecting them? Instead of taking us into custody, the government should be quick to act against the guilty BJP leaders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-stopped-at-sitapur-dares-police-to-produce-warrant-or-arrest-her/articleshow/86762417.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Pune||Pune: Crisis centres for women promised two years ago remain a pipe dream||PUNE: Since its announcement two years back, Sakhi, the one-stop crisis centre for women, which was supposed to function from Mundhwa and Phulenagar, is yet to begin operation. When such a centre was first announced in 2019, two non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were running it from makeshift places. Maher was running it from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run Dalvi Hospital, while Chaitanya Mahila Mandal (CMM) was running one from the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada. Maher left the work over issues regarding payment a year later, while the CMM had to shift to its own premises at Moshi after the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital was converted into a Covid hospital for children and they were not allotted any other place for the centre. Hira Begum Mulla, president, Maher NGO, said that it did operate a centre from Dalvi Hospital in 2019, but discontinued after a year over non-payment and other issues. “We provide shelter and other facilities to poor and destitute women and children. With rising cases of sexual assault being reported, there is a huge need for such centres in the city and it is sad that they are not working,” said Mulla. Jyoti Pathania, founder director, Chaitanya Mahila Mandal, which runs a crisis centre at Moshi said, “We handle between 30-45 cases of women or girls in distress per month. Over the past two years, the cases have increased. It would really help if such a crisis centre gets a permanent office within the city limits,” said Pathania. “The Mundhwa OOSC building work is complete but the water pipeline work remains. We have not yet received a full proposal for a grant from Maher due to which payment is pending. We are appointing another NGO. Till then our protection officers will handle the work of OSC1. The proposal to construct OOSC2 on government land in Phulenagar has been submitted to the Centre,” said district collector Rajesh Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crisis-centres-for-women-promised-two-years-ago-remain-a-pipe-dream/articleshow/86755080.cms||Ardhra Nair

Following a ‘clean air’ theme at eight major junctions across areas, participants held up signs, talked about road safety and held forth on how Pune can be made accident-free. The campaign was organised by social entrepreneurship platform Bee The Lead, in collaboration with a few city-based youth-led NGOs, such as the Swachh Pune Swachh Bharat team at Magarpatta and Amanora junctions, Philants NGO at Jangli Maharaj Road and Fergusson College Road, Tara Foundation at Anand Nagar Swargate junction, WORK Foundation at NIBM Road and Kedari junction, and Swachh Kalyani citizens’ group at Kalyani Nagar.

---||Goa||How an early morning trip to Kalyani helped salvage FC Goa’s Durand Cup campaign||Panaji: FC Goa could have so easily let go of the chance to lift their maiden Durand Cup. Goa won Asia’s oldest football tournament with a 1-0 extra time win against Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday. But when the knockout round was about to kick off, the Indian Super League (ISL) side were in-fact preparing to pack their bags for home. It all started when Goa were drawn to play Delhi FC at the Mohun Bagan ground, but a visit to the venue by coach Juan Ferrando and Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football, made it clear that football was just not possible. “The pitch was water-logged and unplayable,” Puskur told TOI on Tuesday. “We asked for a venue change, or possibly delay the match by a day (due to heavy rains).” The organisers shifted the quarterfinal clash to Kalyani Stadium since the venue was available after Army Red pulled out of the tournament due to Covid-19 cases in the team. Goa, though, were not convinced, with Kerala Blasters coach Ivan Vukomanovic’s scathing criticism of the venue playing heavily on their minds. “We had one player (Jorge Ortiz) who was severely injured and tried to put the safety of our players first. Through the course of the night (September 23), we had senior members of the Durand committee call us. We tried to look and identify alternative venues. “Given the short proximity of time, we felt that perhaps there might be a necessity to pull out of the tournament, keeping the safety of our players in mind,” said Puskur. The players were also hesitant to take the field. On a request from high-ranking officials, Goa agreed to make an early-morning trip to Kalyani on the day of the match and see the ground conditions for themselves. Puskur himself made that long-distance trip, leaving the team hotel at 5am. Three hours later, he told the players in a Whatsapp message that “we should field a team.” “I’ve been here for an hour and looked at the pitch everywhere,” Puskur said in the message, accompanied by pictures of the ground. “I will admit the ground is not going to be Old Trafford, but honestly speaking hand over heart, I was expecting much worse. The weather is also sunny and no clouds around as of now. It’s expected to stay this way. Keeping this in mind, my honest submission is that we should field a team.” Coach Ferrando and the players took Puskur’s advice and after a quick breakfast left for Kalyani at 9.45am. The team bus reached the venue at 12.20pm, less than two hours before their knockout clash. Goa took the field, defeated Delhi 5-1, and the rest, as they say, is history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/how-an-early-morning-trip-to-kalyani-helped-salvage-fc-goas-durand-cup-campaign/articleshow/86794156.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The government has also announced a 180 day long maternity leave, along with 24 days of casual leave and 12 days of medical leave for workers. Speaking at the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee programme on Monday, the CM said that the government would soon be bringing out an HR policy, on the lines of the Uttar Pradesh State Rural Livelihood Mission, which would guarantee leaves etc to the employees. The increase includes Rs 10,000 per month to MGNREGS workers, Rs 10,000 to gram sewaks, Rs 15,656 to technical assistants, Rs 15,156 to computer operators, Rs 34,140 to additional program officers, Rs 15,156 to accounts assistants, Rs 18,320 to operation assistants, Rs 18,320 to helpline executives, Rs 9,000 to class IV worker, Rs 14,100 to block social audit coordinator and Rs 19,900 to district social audit coordinators. “If gram rozgar sewaks are close relatives or family members of newly elected gram pradhans, they will be posted in the nearest vacant gram panchayat but their services will not be terminated. Similarly, after the marriage of a gram sewika, she can be posted in a new district,” the CM said. In addition to this, the CM said that the government is working towards ensuring 100 days of employment under MNREGS to at least 20 lakh families on projects worth Rs 13,000 crore. The consent of the deputy commissioner of MNREGS has been made necessary before terminating the services of rozgar sewaks. The Covid-19 pandemic, the CM said, was challenging for the world, but more so for UP, which had to not just ensure safety of lives and livelihoods of those living in UP but also around 40 lakh migrant workers who returned to the state during the lockdown. “The gram vikas and panchayati raj departments contributed in ensuring that these people had jobs and were made self-reliant. We linked 52 lakh women with the gram ajivika mission. Banking correspondent sakhis were appointed and sachivalayas were constructed in rural areas,” he said. The CM added that in 2020-21, 1.16 crore jobs were generated with 39.46 crore of mandays. Under MNREGS, 103.27 crore mandays of work was generated over the past four years. In 2020-21, 94.37 lakh families got jobs in UP, which is the most in the country while over four years, 246.56 lakh families were given employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-announces-pay-raise-for-job-scheme-workers/articleshow/86762419.cms||---

Three passengers from the ship were detained, with one of them carrying marijuana, officials claimed. One of the suspects arrested after the Juhu and Goregaon raids has been identified as Shreyas Nair, from whom the NCB claimed to have seized an intermediate quantity of Ecstasy pills. The other person is suspected to be the main supplier, officials said. “We have seized commercial quantity of Mephedrone or MD from him,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB. He said that they have also found that these accused have foreign links as they used to buy drugs through the dark net and made payments through the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. NCB officials said that the captain and the security of the cruise liner informed them three passengers had a brawl on board, causing damage to the property.

Colleges for first years opened on Monday after the directorate of collegiate education issued a directive to begin classes for this academic year. “Only second and third year UG and PG students are currently taking offline classes with restrictions on college campus. Today, there was good response from first year students who came to the campus for the orientation programme. We are holding the orientation in batches to avoid crowding,” said Dr S Vanathi, principal, Sri Meenakshi Government College for Women. She said that Covid-19 safety restrictions are in place and that first year students will subsequently continue with online classes until further direction. P Pon Muthuramalingam, regional joint director of collegiate education, said that colleges are allowed to hold only the orientation programme on campus with physical presence of first year students. “The idea behind it is allowing the students to have a feel of the campus environment. Last year, for the whole year, first year students did not even see their college campus at all. By making them come for orientation, we can encourage Covid-19 vaccination among those who are 18 years of age or above as well,” he said. The American College, Lady Doak College and Thiagarajar College of Arts and Sciences, had already held orientation programmes for first year students through online and are not keen on reopening for first year students since they are not vaccinated for Covid-19. “Safety of students comes first. We are allowing even second and third year students now only based on priority and only if they are fully vaccinated. We have to wait for some more time to have first year students back on campus,” principal of The American College, Davamani M Christober said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/first-years-come-to-campus-for-orientation-online-class-to-continue/articleshow/86761697.cms||---

---||Madurai||Madurai: Traffic flow redirected at Kalavasal signal junction||MADURAI: The Madurai city traffic police have redirected vehicles plying between Palanganatham and Guru Theatre to help prevent traffic jams and reduce waiting time at the Kalavasal signal junction. The Kalavasal signal junction is one of the busiest junctions in Madurai city and there are often snarl-ups, especially during peak hours. To reduce traffic snarls, a four-lane flyover was built at the junction on the Bypass Road and was inaugurated in June 2020. However, vehicles, including buses coming from Guru Theatre to Palanganatham and vice versa continued to ply on the road below the flyover causing jams. From Monday, the traffic route at Kalavasal junction has been redirected with barricades and traffic signals changed so that vehicles plying from Guru Theatre to Palanganatham and vice versa will no longer be able to take the road below the flyover. Further, vehicles coming from Guru Theatre will only be able to take the left towards Arasaradi or right towards Theni Road. Similarly, traffic from Palanganatham can only take the right towards Arasaradi or left towards Theni Road. For commuting from Palanganatham towards Guru Theatre or vice versa, vehicles have to take the flyover. The change is expected to ease the flow of traffic at Kalavasal. “With one signal no longer in use due to the redirection of traffic and only three signals in use, we saved a waiting time of 35 seconds, which will help prevent traffic pile up.,” said I Eswaran, DCP, traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/traffic-flow-redirected-at-kalavasal-signal-jn/articleshow/86761700.cms||---

Till 7pm, 2,286 applications had been cleared by the colleges and 795 students had also paid their fees. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the admission process, including verification of documents, is completely online for the second successive year. Of the 790 applications at Lady Shri Ram College, the maximum was for philosophy (H) with 20 seats and a cutoff of 97.5% for general category candidates. “It seems there may not be a second list for philosophy for general category students,” said principal Suman Sharma. “There is also a lot of interest in political science. However, that course had nearly double the number of seats as philosophy.” At Miranda House, around 500 of the 1,100 or so applications were for admission to the BA Programme course. “Seats are filling up quickly, though the first day of admissions is usually slow. For courses like physics, chemistry and political science, it looks like we may face over-admissions,” said acting principal Bijaylaxmi Nanda. Despite a high cut off of 98.5%, political science (H) had a large response at Gargi College. Principal Promila Kumar said, “We received around 600 applications overall, of which we approved 70 today. Though we don’t think we will have over-admissions, the first day’s response was better than expected.” For the 58 political science (H) seats, Aryabhatta College received around 60 applications and approved 40 during the day. At Indraprastha College for Women, principal Babli Moitra Saraf said there was an enormous response, mostly for BA Programme, with some combinations possibly facing over-admission. Aspirant Hitakshi Bedi, who had scored a 100% aggregate in Class XII under CBSE, took admission in economics (H) at Shri Ram College of Commerce. By the end of the day her application only awaited the principal’s approval. “The process was smooth and we were required only to select our choice of college and course,” said Bedi. “I am looking forward to attending offline classes at North Campus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-1-rush-of-aspirants-but-all-online/articleshow/86761702.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Following an initiative by the Union ministry of defence (MoD), a software was developed to cater to services on portals of all 62 cantonment boards across the country, including Secunderabad Cantonment, through the e-Chhawani portal. “While the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is launching various mobile applications using innovative schemes to further good governance, the Cantonment Board could not take up similar initiatives to improve lives of locals,” rued N Jagan, a software profession and resident of Mahendra Hills. To ensure better services to the people, good governance through various initiatives is a key tool. However, except major wings such as property tax, health & sanitation, engineering and water, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board is still lagging behind neighbouring municipal body. “Many are yet to understand the newly-developed software and it will take some time,” a senior Cantonment Board official told TOI. “While the goal of good governance is to provide people a transparent, accountable, and responsive government, initiatives have not reached the people due to a lack of awareness. We are educating them,” the official added.

Justice Battu Devanand, after recording the arguments on both sides, said he will give verdict on Tuesday. The counsel for the petitioners argued that the state government has not paid the amount even after high court orders and in some cases, only 79 per cent of the amount was given citing pending vigilance inquiry. The high court had earlier expressed displeasure over the submission of false affidavit on vigilance inquiry. The petitioners further argued that the state government cannot withhold the amount in the name of vigilance inquiry for the works done in the years 2017 and 2018. They have pleaded for directions to the government for full payment with interest on account of thedelay. As the works were similar to a contractual agreement, the state government is liable to pay interest for violating contractual agreements. Considering the arguments on both sides, Justice Battu Devanand reserved the orders and posted the matter for judgement on Tuesday.

From live orchestras to joy rides, fireworks, and cultural activities the traffic-free road initiative has been receiving a tremendous response, with hundreds of locals thronging the area to enjoy the weekend with their family and friends. This week, the one kilometre long national flag demonstration to commemorate the 152nd birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi was the highlight of the event. Nearly 300 Lions Clubs International members unfurled the tricolour while the hundreds of people who were already present on the stretch raised patriotic slogans. “District 320B of the Lions Club has set a record with a display of the Indian Flag,” said Arun Kumar Guduri, district cabinet secretary, Lions Clubs International. The flag, which was made of satin cloth took three days to stitch and Rs 1 lakh was spent on it. Other key attractions of this week were handicrafts and handloom stalls. A tandoori chai stall set up at the carnival this week was also a huge crowd puller. “This has now become our favourite hangout spot in the city. It is like a celebration. We not only spend time with family but also make new friends. The number activities and entertainment programmes being organised are taking the whole experience to another level,” said Aneesha Singh, a resident of Begumpet. After performances by the Army and RPF bands became a huge hit with the public during the last few weeks, the state police band is also gearing up to impress the crowds. The band will play for the public this Sunday. “I am really looking forward to the live orchestra, music and the food stalls which are being set up here every week,” said P Gyanesh, a resident of Khairtabad. There will be fireworks that last up to at least three minutes, this time as well, authorities said. “People can enjoy it from anywhere on Tank Bund road,” said one official. The urban forestry wing of HMDA will once again set up stalls for free distribution of saplings. SHE Teams have also been deployed at the event to spread awareness among locals on various things. Based on instructions from municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao, HMDA is making a slew of arrangements every week for the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hmdas-sunday-funday-growing-bigger-better-by-the-wk/articleshow/86761616.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Hyd leader in housing, office mkts: Knight Frank Q3 report||Hyderabad: The city’s position as a leader in the national real estate circuit has been reinforced with Knight Frank’s latest quarterly report (Q3), released on Monday. The findings not only put Hyderabad at the top of the charts in residential sales, but also reveal that it recorded a significant 2.1 million square feet of office space absorption during Q3, second highest in the country. Bengaluru led the pack with 4.3 mn sft of office area being picked up in the city during the last three months. “Hyderabad has witnessed remarkable growth in office transactions on the back of robust demand by IT and manufacturing sectors. Strong infrastructure development and socio-economic friendly government policies have been a big boost for the market,” said Knight Frank India chairman and MD Shishir Baijal. Over the last nine months, Hyderabad has closed office deals to the tune of 3.7 mn sft. But while its commercial vertical fared well, the city outperformed most others in the housing segment as it not only sold 5,987 homes — as per the report — but also saw over 9,000 new units launched. “Hyderabad residential market has seen a significant YoY growth in residential sales in Q3 2021, as most end users viewed this to be a good time to enter the property market with low home loan rates as well as improvement in overall affordability. As the economy improves, we can expect further strengthening of demand trends,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director (research), Knight Frank India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-leader-in-housing-office-mkts-knight-frank-q3-report/articleshow/86761632.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad Cantonment Board citizen charter remains on paper, civic complaints pile up||SECUNDERABAD: A missing citizen charter has added to the woes of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) residents. Unlike in neighbouring Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, the charter in Cantonment remains only on paper, with its details not publicly displayed anywhere — inside or outside the SCB office.  Result: Officials have no accountability, which in turn leads to inordinate delays in getting any work done, argue locals. “A charter categorically mentions the time period that SCB can take to complete a task. In the absence of it being available to the public, they cannot question officials if the work is not completed on time,” said Trimulgherry resident, G Dharma Reddy who has been running from pillar to post to get his water pollution issue resolved. He added: “If the charter was in place, officials had to finish the job within the 10 or 15 days earmarked for it. But because it has been reduced to a dummy, there’s no set time frame. I visited the water wing office twice for my problem, but to no avail.” Residents who’ve applied for birth and death certificates — some of whom TOI spoke to — aired a similar grievance. “Getting a birth certificate in the Cantonment is a tough task. Though all necessary documents have been submitted, officials are delaying it for reasons like shortage of resources, holidays etc,” said one of them. As per the charter, the task should not take more than a week. SCB officials, predictably, insist that there aren’t any lags now. “Since we launched the e-Chhawani portal, we have sped up the process of issuing birth and death certificates,” a SCB official claimed, while citing multiple reasons for delay in the other works.  “Multiple duties like tackling Covid-19 pandemic cases, vaccination drives, court cases etc have led to a delay in disposing of applications,” the official added. These delays, locals allege, are occurring in a range of works — mutation of properties in ‘general land record’ (GLR), sanction of building plans, mutation of properties in tax register, to name a few. They also point out how the Cantonment Board office recently spent Rs 13 lakh for facelift and beautification works, in view of VIPs (Parliament Committee) visit, but paid no attention to putting up a printed citizen charter at any of their department offices.  Be it the health and sanitation wing, water supply wing, property tax wing or the engineering wing. “If the missing charter is not enough, even the SCB portal has glitches. One can keep calling on the contact numbers displayed on the portal but is sure to get no response. It leaves people with no other option but to visit the office in person to lodge a complaint. Efforts to directly meet officials and represent our problems is also a major challenge,” said S Yadu Bhushan, a resident of Ravi Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-citizen-charter-remains-on-paper-civic-complaints-pile-up/articleshow/86761566.cms||Sunil Mungara

An officer from the ACB said the complainant’s wife filed a case against an illegal money lender. “Mali had demanded Rs40,000 from the complainant to file a chargesheet in favour of his wife’s complaint. Later, he agreed on Rs30,000,” the officer said. He said after receiving the complaint, a trap was laid near the police station. “We caught him red-handed, accepting the money,” he said. Two PMC employees held in graft case The state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) arrested a foreman and a driver of Pune municipal corporation (PMC) for accepting a bribe of Rs10,000 from a 36-year-old PMC contract worker to allow him to work on night shifts and to stop his transfer. The two were trapped on Saturday evening near the Vishrambaug ward office. The foreman, Ravi Londhe, and driver of a garbage truck, Harshal Adagale, are posted with Vishrambaug Wada ward office, ACB said. According to the ACB, the two demanded a bribe of Rs15,000 from the contract worker but eventually settled for Rs10,000. Adagale accepted the bribe at the behest of Londhe. Last week, ACB sleuths arrested a talathi from Charholi Budruk in Haveli taluka, while he was accepting a Rs 30,000 bribe to update a 7/12 extract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/acb-arrests-policeman-in-rs-30000-bribery-case/articleshow/86755167.cms||---

Venkanna said his team assisted investigating officer J Surender Reddy, additional DCP of SIT in collecting 19 spent cartridges (shell casings) of 9mm pistols, AK-47,SLR rifles, two 9 mm pistols, cotton swabs of blood stains from the spot where bodies of the deceased were found and cotton swabs from the palms of Arif and Chennakeshavulu to collect gunshot residue. The team also recorded 25 videos and 51 photos from alleged encounter site. The panel had posed multiple questions on whether the spot from where police party opened fire at the rape and murder case accused was cordoned off. Venkanna said the spot where the bodies of the four accused were lying had been cordoned off but the spot from where police opened fire was initially not secured but on his advice, the IO secured that spot too. Despite scouring the alleged encounter site for several hours, their team could not find any spent bullets from the spot and as per his advise, a police team used sieve and even deployed BD squad to find spent bullets but none were found.  Venkanna said that he did not have any information from the IO pertaining to the number of rounds fired at the alleged encounter site. As Venkanna also stated that GSR was collected using cotton ear buds and distilled water, the panel asked him whether he knew that as per NHRC guidelines for collection of GSR from victims in police firing cases, only hand wash method of GSR collection is permissible and not any other method. Venkanna stated that he was unaware of such guidelines or forensic guide for crime investigators of National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science which mentions cotton bud method is the least preferred method in collection of GSR and collection with cotton bud should only be done with five per cent nitric acid solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spent-bullets-could-not-be-recovered-clues-team-official/articleshow/86761668.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Daily cases in the district have reduced drastically and the district did not record more than 100 fresh cases in the last one week. Similarly, the weekly test positivity rate was also below 1%, but the health department has not reduced surveillance. Active cases, which was more than 2,200 in the first week of September, is below 900 as on date. However, the district continues to conduct an average of 8,000 – 10,000 RT-PCR tests to keep tabs on all the primary contacts of those who are tested positive. District nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ashok H told TOI that the surveillance mechanism will continue with more emphasis on schools. “We are continuing our surveillance by concentrating on surrounding areas of each positive case. Further, more emphasis is on educational institutions including schools which have reopened now,” he said. Between September 27 and October 3, the district recorded a weekly test positivity rate of 0.9%. While the district conducted 64,817 RT-PCR tests in one week, 610 positive cases were reported. Barring Mangaluru taluk, cases in the other taluks were less than 100.

---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad Cantonment Board and GHMC merger demand echo in assembly||HYDERABAD: The demand for merger of Secunderabad Cantonment Board areas with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation found an echo in the assembly on Monday. During zero hour, Secunderabad Cantonment MLA G Sayanna (TRS) urged CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to speak with the Prime Minister and defence minister to ensure merger of the two areas. The Cantonment areas are with the SCB which comes under the ministry of defence (MoD). The state government has to write to the Centre either requesting or expressing its willingness for the merger. Sayanna said that despite being in the heart of the city, people in Cantonment areas lacked civic amenities when compared to Malkajgiri, Alwal, Kukatpally and other areas under the purview of GHMC. Citing how fund shortage was a major problem in SCB, the TRS MLA pointed out that Rs 650 crore in dues was pending with the Centre. “There is a growing demand from a large number of residents for merger of SCB areas with GHMC,” Sayanna said and urged speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy to take the issue to the CM’s notice who was not present in the House. Municipal minister KT Rama Rao, who had recently spoken in favour of merger, was also not in the House when Sayanna brought up the issue. Sayanna claimed that the merger issue had gained momentum in 1999 after he had raised it in the undivided state. The file pertaining to SCB merger with MCH (GHMC was formed in 2007) was also moved, but the merger did not happen, he said.  As much as 70% of the Secunderabad Cantonment assembly constituency is covered by the Cantonment areas and remaining 30% by GHMC. Responding to Sayanna’s request, labour minister Ch Malla Reddy said he was aware of the problems being faced by Cantonment residents as he had earlier served as Malkajgiri MP and was also a member of the defence committee. “The issue will be taken to the notice of the CM. The state government will look into it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-and-ghmc-merger-demand-echo-in-assembly/articleshow/86762453.cms||Roushan Ali

The court then said in the order, “The Commissioner of Police will, however, specifically keep in mind that the resolve of this Court is to ensure that Police Officers under his command behave well to citizens, as has been directed from time to time. Unfortunately, some officers still do not appear to understand their constitutional obligations while dealing with the citizenry. Certainly, therefore, strict action will have to be pursued against any officer who is found to be erring.” In the petition filed through advocate C Unnikrishnan, the couple had alleged that police officers had created a scene similar to searching for a criminal at the apartment complex at which they were staying. When they appeared at the police station the next day, they were shouted at and verbally abused by the police officers, the petition had stated. On Monday itself, the court criticized police’s behaviour in another case in which it was alleged that a man who sought receipt for a complaint he filed at the police station was handcuffed and beaten up. The police officers were allegedly irked by his attempt to record their video. The court said even treating dogs like this is illegal and asked how can an Indian do this to another Indian. Even the British didn’t do like this to Indians, the court said. Further, the court said it is of the opinion that Section 117 of the Kerala Police Act, which makes it an offence to interfere with police functioning, should be taken away. It is the most misused provision by police and such power cannot be given to our police, the court said. Police officials are public servants and there is no need to address them as sir, the court said. There is no evidence that the person spoke disrespectfully or took videos, the court pointed out. Even if he did record a video, will the sky fall down, the court asked. Noticing that the officers who attacked the person was still in service, the court directed state police chief to file an action taken report by October 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-for-strict-action-against-cops-using-foul-language/articleshow/86761738.cms||---

But do not force the remaining ones to vacate the premises immediately,” the court said, addressing state counsel A Sanjeev Kumar. A bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice T Vinod Kumar gave this direction after going through the report furnished by legal services authority at Rangareddy, who, under instructions from the court, studied the facilities at Bata Singaram and informed about the status of facilities prevailing at the temporary market. His report conveyed a message that a lot of work was yet to be done . The state counsel said there were certain discrepancies in the report.

The plants were about three-five feet tall, which are sold at a price of Rs 2,000 per kg. A release from the Shirpur taluka police said the cops had received a tip-off about the illegal ganja plantation in Mahadev Dondwada village under the Shirpur taluka police station. Acting on the information, officers and personnel of the police station and local crime branch formed a team to raid the place. The police said the plantation was in a very remote and hilly location. The cops had to access it on foot as vehicles cannot reach the exact spot. The plantation was near the foothills of a mountain and on forest land. On seeing the ganja-like plants, the police took the details of the farmer cultivating the same. The land belonged to a farmer who has been booked under sections of the Narcotis Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The raid was carried out under the guidance of Dhule SP Pravinkumar Patil and additional SP Prashant Bacchav. DIG B G Shekhar Patil of the Nashik Range has instructed the SPs of Nashik Rural, Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar to be vigilant of such illegal cultivation of drugs. Quite a few raids have been conducted in the past in which farmers have been found cultivating the banned drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/shirpur-police-bust-ganja-farming-seize-207kg-plants/articleshow/86760190.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Rauf, an eyewitness to the alleged encounter, told the panel that he heard gunshots from his left and right as he lay on the ground but claimed he couldn’t see who among the cops fired as his eyes were covered in mud thrown by Arif. He said Arif had snatched the firearm of CI Narasimha Reddy after hurling mud at cops and the panch witnesses present nearby. “Arif ran forward and started firing. ACP V Surender asked all of us to lie down and told the accused multiple times to stop firing and surrender. Cops also started firing which lasted for about two to three minutes...,” Rauf stated.

At one time there was a flourishing football culture and lots of football tournaments were conducted here, resulting in several internationals and Olympians who played for the country. The names of KP Dhanraj, Peter Thangaraj, Tulasidas Balaram, Dharmalingam Kannan, Anthony Patrick, Janakiram and John Victor still evokes pride among football lovers in the cantonment and throughout India. I have met the CEO of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board, Ajit Reddy, a few times and he seemed to be a sports loving person and said he is willing to develop sports in the cantonment. The need of the hour is expertise at the ground level. The SCB must institute a sports cell (like the one GHMC has), which will consider the matter of organising and developing sports at grassroots level. SCB should also rope in government schools which have grounds to add to the already existing ones like Ammaguda surrounding Bolarum school, Bowenpally, Trimulgherry village and Gymkhana. The Army has some fine grounds at EME centre and AOC campuses. If their cooperation and approval is obtained, plenty of grounds will be available. At one time, famous players like Olympian S.A.Salaam, GM Pentiah (qualified assistant coach of India), P. Ramaswamy, P Thangaraj and John Victor (international) used to regularly coach children during summer coaching camps in SCB area. As a former international and captain of Indian football team, it pains me to see the prevailing situation. Everyone must unite to help football regain its glory in SCB region.

---||Pune||Pune: Commodities to cost more as transport charges to rise||PUNE: Increasing fuel prices have once again become a significant worry for owners of trucks and other transport vehicles. Now, many are mulling an increase in transportation costs — which will affect prices of many basic commodities for consumers. On Sunday, the price of one litre of diesel in Pune stood at Rs 96.50, against Rs 96.19 on Saturday. The price of petrol, too, increased to Rs 107.95 on Sunday against Rs 107.71 on Saturday. Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatana, told TOI, “Diesel is just Rs 3.50 short of the hundred-mark in Pune. Prices have been increasing for almost a week now. It is a cause of concern for transporters. If this continues, transportation costs will surely go up and some of us are already mulling increasing the same by 10-15 per cent. This impacts prices of all commodities.” The rise of fuel prices has been attributed to increasing global crude oil rates by dealers. Shinde added, “We were very hopeful that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) council would bring fuel under GST, which would have controlled the rates. However, that has not happened and things are now going out of hand. In fact, fuel prices have been on a constant rise since early this year. They have gone down very few times and only by a few paise — but keep rising.” A city-based transporter operating from Market Yard, choosing to stay unnamed, told TOI that an increase in transportation costs is imminent. “It will go up by around 15 per cent for now and may increase even further if prices aren’t controlled. The market is almost back on track. Transporters are getting work, unlike earlier. Increasing costs will not affect our business now. Moreover, we have suffered heavy losses for more than a year now due to the pandemic and cannot sustain it any further. My vehicles supply vegetables to retailers in different parts of the city and transportation costs will go up by around Rs 100 soon,” he said. Vegetable retailers said they were aware of this. “It is a bit concerning. Vegetable prices will go up, too. I pay Rs 200 per day for a vehicle-load of vegetables coming to me from Market Yard. If they increase the price by Rs 150-200, vegetable prices are bound to go up, and the same can be said for other commodities as well,” said Ramlal Dhuna, who sells vegetables in Mohammadwadi. K L Sahni, a working professional from Kondhwa, told TOI, “It is concerning for the middle-class as our salaries have gone down.We have had to make many changes and adjustments for 1.5 years in the pandemic. It is sad that we must suffer even more now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/commodities-to-cost-more-as-transport-charges-to-rise/articleshow/86755184.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nashik||Nitin Gadkari: Rs 5,000cr for Nashik-Mumbai highway||NASHIK: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday announced his ministry will spend Rs 5,000 crore within the next two-and-a-half years to upgrade the Nashik-Mumbai national highway. Gadkari was addressing a gathering in Nashik after dedicating and laying the foundation stone of 41 road projects in north Maharashtra at a cost of Rs 2,048 crore. “My ministry will completely overhaul the Nashik-Mumbai highway so that the travel time between these two cities would not be more than two hours. A sizeable stretch of the road would be made of concrete,” he said. During the event, Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal drew Gadkari’s attention towards the deplorable condition of the road due to which the travel time between Mumbai and Nashik is around seven hours. Responding to Bhujbal, Gadkari said the Nashik-Gonde stretch on the Mumbai-Nashik highway would be converted from the existing six lanes to an eight-lane highway. “Similarly, the stretch between Gonde to Wadpe would be made of concrete and converted from four lanes to a six-lane stretch. Apart from this, the road on the Nashik side would be linked with the under-construction Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway,” he added. Gadkari said that he has also approved a 6km-long double decker bridge on the Dwarka-Nashik Road. It would be Nashik city’s maiden double decker bridge. “The top deck would be used for the Neo-Metro trains while the second one would be used for road transport. I have approved the project after seeing a presentation. The project cost would be around Rs 1,600 crore and would be completed within the next three years,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gadkari-rs-5000cr-for-nashik-mumbai-highway/articleshow/86760207.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Lucknow||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: BJP govt akin to Hitler & British regimes, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: For the second time within a year, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and thousands of his party workers hit the road — this time to reach Lakhimpur Kheri — till he was arrested for violating prohibitory orders. He was in police custody for four hours before he was released. Akhilesh described the police action in Lakhimpur as inhumane and worse than what the British did to protestors in the pre-Independence era. He equated the BJP government with German dictator Hitler’s regime. Read more stories from Lakhimpur Kheri On December 7 last year, Akhilesh had hit the road in solidarity with the farmers’ protest against the three farm laws. He was arrested and detained for several hours before he was released. On Monday, with heavy bandobast in place, authorities had set up a four-layer security cordon around Akhilesh Yadav’s Vikramaditya Marg residence. The third layer included steel barricades and trucks parked to obstruct any movement of vehicles outside Akhilesh’s residence. But defying the decree, SP chief stepped out of his home in a fleet. When stopped by the police, he got off his vehicle and staged a sit-in accompanied by senior party leader Ram Gopal Yadav. While Akhikesh condemned the BJP’s handling of the situation in Lakhimpur and demanded removal of MoS Home, arrest of his son for ‘murder’ of four farmers and Rs 2 crore ex gratia to the kin of each of the farmers killed, Ram Gopal sought CM Yogi Adityanath’s resignation for what he described as BJP orchestrated ‘bloodbath’ in Lakhimpur. “The ruthlessness with which the state government is trying to crush the farmers’ agitation is akin to how similar protests by Indians were handled by the British. The Union home minister had first threatened the farmers and thereafter his son unleashed a reign of terror by knocking off farmers protesting peacefully,” Akhilesh said. He went on to state that the manner in which the government is silencing the voice being raised by the oppressed, it reminds one of how Hitler handled resistance under his dictatorship. During the six-hour long high voltage drama which started around 8am with SP workers gathering in large numbers outside the party president’s house following rumours that he has been put under house arrest, SP workers clashed with cops on several occasions but timely intervention of Akhilesh helped contain the situation. A police jeep parked outside the Gautam Palli police station was torched. Akhilesh accused the police of setting the vehicle on fire to exert pressure on the SP workers who, he claimed, were ‘protesting peacefully’. Akhilesh and Ram Gopal along with party workers were arrested and taken to Eco Garden where they were detained for four hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-govt-akin-to-hitler-and-british-regimes-sp/articleshow/86762488.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Nashik||Only 4 DCHCs operational in rural parts of Nashik||Nashik: With constant fall in Covid-19 cases in rural Nashik, the district health department has temporarily shut down 20 of the 24 Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) set up in the rural hospitals during the second wave of the pandemic. The district administration had converted 24 rural hospital into DCHCs to accommodate the rising number of patients. However, from May-end, the number of admissions in these facilities has been consistently dropping due to which a decision of closing down the DCHCs and taking non-covid patients has begun in a phased manner. Civil surgeon Ashok Thorat said, “Out of the 28 rural hospitals, 24 were converted in DCHCs after Covid cases went up from March this year. As of now only 4 rural hospitals converted into DCHCs — Yeola, Sinnar, Pimpalgaon and Malegaon — are operational.” “There are no Covid patients at the Pimpalgaon DCHC. If a patient or two arrive for admission, the patients concerned are referred to the Nashik civil hospital. This is, however, a temporary arrangement. If cases start to increase the rural hospitals will again be converted into DCHC to accommodate the Covid patients,” he added. Various measures are being taken by the district administration keeping in mind the third wave of Covid-19 and the possibility that could affect the children. “It has also been decided to increase the bed capacity of all rural hospitals keeping in mind the third wave of Covid -19. The rural hospitals would again be converted into DCHCs in the event of the third wave, said Thorat. The DCHCs that are operating now have very few patients admitted and at the same time even the district Covid hospital has around 40 patients admitted there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/only-4-dchcs-operational-in-rural-parts-of-nashik/articleshow/86760220.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad IT sector: Few women on top, time to bridge gender gap||HYDERABAD: The city’s IT industry has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years, creating lucrative career opportunities for lakhs of youth but the number of women making it to the top echelons in IT companies is still abysmally low. “If you look at the overall employee pyramid, in the bottom part, you will see a lot of inclusivity around 40-45%, but as you climb up the organisational ladder, and reach top level, there are only a handful of women leaders,” said Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani K Aroll. While this is certainly not a city specific problem, what is heartening is that IT leaders in the city are making a conscious effort to empower more women in tech to make it to the corner office by creating a conducive environment. HYSEA, the city’s apex IT body, has created a women’s leader forum this year with the objective of increasing the gender inclusivity quotient at the top level. The move is aimed at increasing the proportion of women in leadership roles from the current level of around 4-5% to 20% in the next five years by conducting extensive mentoring and networking sessions as well as working with member IT companies to formulate and execute policies that help women grow in their careers. Kiranmai Pendyala, head of human resources-India at Western Digital Corporation, pointed out that one of the challenges observed as women employees move up the organisation’s ladder is that women have a lower aspirational quotient as compared to men primarily because of the culture. “Despite women getting into the workforce in large numbers at the entry level, in the larger patriarchal societal fabric it is considered that the primary job of the women is to take care of dependents after marriage. This is the time women are in the mid-level and they tend to drop off,” she explained. She pointed out that a leadership role demands time and effort and while in most of the cases, a man would be only focussed on that job at hand, women have to shoulder other responsibilities as well, making it challenging for them to grow without adequate support infrastructure. In terms of offering women an equitable career growth and representation at senior levels, Cognizant’s global head of BFSI digital operations and Hyderabad centre head Sailaja Josyula pointed out that her company has launched a women’s global leadership development initiative. “We have already launched 12 cohorts across six geographies and are in the process of putting 1,000 high performing women in leadership roles by the end of 2021,” she said. Like Cognizant, many tech companies are initiating such programmes to not only tick the diversity and inclusion boxes, but also because they are seeing immense value that women bring to organisations. Deepthi Ravula, CEO of women exclusive incubator WE HUB, stressed the importance of mentorship and networking opportunities for women to grow in a career. Besides, she too stressed on the importance of companies adopting best practices such as maternity and paternity leaves as well as creation of support infrastructure and inclusive spaces that can help in closing the gender gap at the leadership level. “We see a higher demand for women looking to get back into the professional field, determined to learn new skills and do well,” Sailaja Josyula, Hyderabad centre head, Cognizant “This issue related to women participation in senior positions is not unique to the city or its IT industry, it is a global problem…Yes there are some constraints which are not easily addressable by a single organisation because a ‘cultural shift’ has to happen,” BVR Mohan Reddy, founder chairman, Cyient “Industry has realised that it is a business imperative to have diversity...If the company has to grow in a balanced manner, they realise that women leaders also have to grow. There is a conscious investment by companies in growing that ecosystem internally,” Kiranmai Pendyala, head of human resources-India at Western Digital Corporation Long road aheadWomen account for around 34% of workforce in IT sector Many tech companies are now encouraging women, who have been on a break, to rejoin the workforce Overall, women representation on boards in India has increased from 11.4% in 2015 to 17.3% in 2021 (Source: Industry reports)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-it-sector-few-women-on-top-time-to-bridge-gender-gap/articleshow/86762543.cms||Swati Rathor

---||Lucknow||Post-Covid disorder in kids harming organs in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Covid-19 cases have declined to negligible level, but the residual effect of the disease is posing a challenge with cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) surfacing after recovery. Doctors said that MIS-C is a serious condition in which organs such as heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs get inflamed leading to malfunction. It can happen due to several reasons, but at present, most cases are associated with Covid-19.  It has been seen that antibodies created in children and teenagers during Covid-19 continue to operate even after recovery. At times, these antibodies go out of control and start attacking healthy cells of the organs which results in inflammation. About 50 cases of MIS-C including five from Lucknow have been reported in the past three months at two big centres of the state capital. The patients were mainly aged between four and 18 years and had recovered from Covid-19 but developed MIS-C a month after recovery. King George’s Medical University (KGMU) received 30 such cases from across the state including five from Lucknow, while 20 patients from east UP came to Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS). Doctors at both institutes confirmed that some of these patients also died due to multiple organ failure, but data has not been maintained because it is not a “notifiable disease”. Medical superintendent at KGMU and Covid-19 expert Prof D Himanshu said that although the exact reason behind this is unknown, initial findings suggest that it happens when the immune system goes haywire and starts damaging healthy cells, which if not addressed timely, can lead to multi-organ failure. Common symptoms of such patients are fever for three to five days, severe abdominal pain, bloodshot eyes, skin rashes, sudden drop in blood pressure and loose motions, he added. Paediatric surgery head and medical superintendent of Covid hospital at RMLIMS Prof Srikesh Singh said that emergency symptoms of the disease include amnesia, loss of alertness, disorientation, unusual or strange behaviour and disruptions in perception, breathing trouble and persistent pain or pressure in the chest, besides change in colour of skin, lips or nails to grey or blue. “Surfacing of any such symptoms should be taken seriously and patients should be rushed to hospital,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/post-covid-syndrome-in-children-causing-organ-damage-50-cases-in-3-months-in-up/articleshow/86762522.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Mumbai||BMC tweaks Himalaya FOB plan, to build a dog-legged staircase||MUMBAI: The BMC has proposed a minor modification in one of the landing staircases of Himalaya bridge that is being reconstructed at the northern end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. A portion of the foot over-bridge (FOB) crashed on March 14, 2019, killing seven persons. Civic officials said the plan is to build a dog-legged staircase, which will take much less area than a straight staircase, following a representation made to the BMC by Anjuman-I-Islam institute last month. The institute had said that its ‘right of way’ must be protected when the Rs 6-crore stainless steel bridge is constructed. TimesViewHimalaya bridge was very popular with commuters moving in and out of CSMT. There is an urgent need to construct the new foot over bridge after the old one collapsed in March 2018. Currently, people are forced to run to cross the busy arterial road below as the pedestrian signal lasts barely 20 seconds. During peak hours, a study found 250-300 people crossing the street in a single pedestrian green time cycle.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said the landing flight of stairs of the new FOB will go down to half step before turning 180 degrees and continuing downwards. “This would ensure that the institute entrance is not affected in any way,” he said. “Earlier, we were pla-nning to take the landing a few feet ahead, but now have finalised a landing at the same spot after turning at a right angle at half-landing." Officials from the bridges department, meanwhile, said they are looking at the feasibility of installing a lift considering that the FOB would be widely used once people step out for work owing to the ease in Covid restrictions. If built, the lift would be helpful for the specially abled. Concerned about the FOB reconstruction plan “dragging on”, activist Kamlakar Shenoy said: “These minor modifications should have been done at the initial planning stage itself. In case of projects, which are of such large public importance, the BMC should hold weekly review meetings to check the work progress so that there is no delay.” The contractor has to complete the new foot over-bridge within 15 months, excluding monsoon months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-tweaks-himalaya-fob-plan-to-build-a-dog-legged-staircase/articleshow/86761752.cms||Richa Pinto

Rana has, however, clarified that he has not quit NC but hinted that he might “join some other outfit for the betterment of Jammu region” as he felt “Kashmir-based parties have not done much for the Valley.” “I am still the provincial president of the J&K National Conference. I will share with the media what I would do,” Rana, former political adviser to Omar Abdullah, told reporters at his Jammu residence while keeping the suspense over rumours of his quitting NC alive. He appealed to all political parties of the Jammu region, including the BJP, to unite and adopt the Jammu declaration to “safeguard the interests of the region in the me way the people of Kashmir and the Union Territory of Ladakh rose above their political and religious affiliations to take a stand on issues concerning their region.” Earlier, several political leaders including former minister Choudhary Lal Singh, who heads the Dogra Swabhiman Sangathan Party (DWSP) and is campaigning for a separate state of Jammu, former MLC Surinder Choudhary and former minister Surjit Singh Slathia met Rana at his residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omar-aide-in-jammu-likely-to-join-bjp/articleshow/86763396.cms||M Saleem Pandit

His maternal uncle was married to a cousin of an accused and after the couple’s relationship turned sour, the nephew was abducted to take revenge, said an officer. His hands and legs were tied with a tape, but he managed to scream for help from a balcony and a passerby informed police. They planned to kill the boy, said Brijendra Yadav, DCP, outer north. The arrested men have been identified as Monu (24), a driver, and Ashok (23), who runs a motorcycle repair shop, police said. Both are residents of Deep Vihar in Rohini. A countrymade pistol was seized. A missing complaint report was filed in Shahbad Dairy on Friday and the boy was rescued on Monday after the arrests on Sunday night. Monu told police his cousin was living at her parents’ house as the couple’s relationship wasn’t good. They even rented a flat at Rs 3,000 to keep the boy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/14-year-old-boy-rescued-two-abductors-held/articleshow/86761757.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Metropolitan Region: CNG price up by Rs 2.59/kg, cooking gas by Rs 2.27/unit||MUMBAI: The price of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) will be hiked by Rs 2.59 per kg, including taxes, from Tuesday morning, while that of piped cooking gas will go up by Rs 2.27 per unit. The revised price of CNG inclusive of all taxes in Mumbai Metropolitan Region will be Rs 54.57 per kg while piped gas rates will escalate to Rs 32.67 per unit (slab 1) and Rs 38.27 per unit (slab 2), respectively. This is the third hike in eight months for CNG consumers in Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai, and rates have gone up by Rs 6.67 per kg (including taxes) this year. Earlier in February, the price of CNG was hiked by Rs 1.50 per kg, while domestic PNG (cooking gas) increased by 95 paise per unit. Subsequently, on July 13, the price of CNG was hiked by Rs 2.58 per kg while cooking gas went up by 55 paise per unit. Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) spokesperson Neera Asthana-Phate said, “The selling price of domestically produced natural gas has been increased by 62% by the government with effect from October 1. Further, regasified LNG prices are at historically high levels. This combination has resulted in a significant increase in the cost of gas being procured by MGL.” “Even after the revision, CNG will be an attractive option as it will be cheaper than petrol and diesel by about 65% and 44%, respectively, in Mumbai,” she added. Petrol and diesel prices have witnessed several hikes lately, with petrol now retailing at Rs 108.43 per litre and diesel at Rs 98.48 per litre in city. Given that the number of CNG vehicles in Mumbai region has now touched 8 lakh, MGL plans to increase its CNG outlets from 272 to 372 in coming months. Automobile companies too have increased production of CNG vehicles, with at least 3 lakh new cars being manufactured by two leading companies in 2021-22, sources said. As for cooking gas, MGL officials said there are over seven lakh households which have piped gas connections in MMR. “It offers 35% savings when compared to domestic LPG, and delivers unmatched convenience, safety and reliability,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cng-price-up-by-rs-2-59/kg-cooking-gas-by-rs-2-27/unit/articleshow/86762888.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena may drop Ramdas Kadam as MLC over his ‘rift’ with minister Anil Parab||MUMBAI: As a result of the ongoing rift between Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam and Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab, the party is unlikely to renominate Kadam to the state legislative council after his term as an MLC ends in January 2022, and may instead opt for a new face to replace Kadam. Over the weekend, a series of audio clips of conversations between Kadam and one of his associates went viral. In the audio clips, Kadam is heard expressing happiness, reportedly over action taken by various authorities against alleged illegal constructions on land owned by Parab in Ratnagiri and Mumbai. Kadam is also heard saying that he was planning to meet BJP leaders Pravin Darekar and former MP Kirit Somaiya. Kadam, however, denied any rift between him and Parab, and said that this was only an attempt to defame him before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Somaiya had filed a complaint accusing Parab of illegally constructing a resort on an agricultural land. The resort is built in Murud village of Dapoli. Somaiya had accused the minister of CRZ violations while constructing the resort. Parab, however, maintained that he did not own the land and he had nothing to do with the construction. Officials said the revenue department had conducted a probe and given a clean chit to Parab. Kadam was a cabinet minister in the earlier BJP-Sena government, but has been sidelined in the present Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “The issue has reached the CM, and the rift between the two ministers seems to have damaged the image of the party and the government. In view of this, it is unlikely that Kadam will be given another term in the legislative council. The party will nominate a fresh face from Mumbai. Kadam is most likely to be dropped when his term ends,” said a senior Sena functionary. The elections for the two seats to the legislative council from the BMC will be held early next year. On Saturday, MNS functionary Vaibhav Khedekar had released eight audio clips in a press conference. The duo alleged the information about the alleged irregularities at the resort linked to Parab was given to the BJP by Kadam. In the audio clips, Kadam is reportedly heard talking to his close associate Prasad Karve about irregularities at the Dapoli resort and Parab’s office in Bandra (E). In another clip, Karve talks to Kadam about arranging a meeting with Somaiya. “All this has been done to defame me before Uddhavji. I have already clarified to the media that the clips are fake. I enjoy good relations with Parab and he is my co-worker in Shiv Sena. I have already filed defamation cases against those who released the clips in the past. I have exposed their corruption so they are trying to defame me. The party has not asked for any explanation from me,” Kadam told TOI. Parab was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-may-drop-kadam-as-mlc-over-his-rift-with-min-anil-parab/articleshow/86761762.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The girl was picked up by the leopard on Saturday evening. This is the second attack by a big cat on a chil in three days as a five-year-old girl was killed in a similar fashion near the Girnare dam in Nashik taluka on Thursday night. Against the backdrop of this incident, the forest department has fixed four cages and deployed its personnel in and around the village. The girl — identified as Rutika Vithhal Vad — belonged to a worker family. Her parents hail from Valsad in Gujarat and have been staying in a room on the farm from where the girl was picked up by the leopard at 7 pm. The incident was immediately reported to the forest department and police following which a search was launched. Despite all the efforts the girl could not be found till 2 am on Sunday. After a break of four hours, the search began again at 6 am in the adjoining fields hwn the half-eaten body of the girl was found. Deputy conservator of forest (east) Tushar Chavan told TOI that four cages in and around the village have been installed to catch the leopard. Chavan said they have appealed to the villagers to take extra precautions until the wild cat is trapped. “We have prepared three teams to tell people to not step out at night and especially not send children out for answering nature’s call. Children should be accompanied by adults who should ideally carry torches and sticks with them,” Chavan said, adding that following these guidelines was important as the village is surrounded by hills, farms and waterbodies making it ideal for wild animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/leopard-kills-four-year-old-girl-in-dindori-taluka/articleshow/86760240.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Addressing the media on Monday, Surendran said it was a serious issue since a fake archaeological record was created to ruin the beliefs of one section. “What has been committed is a grave criminal act to destroy communal harmony and create a divide between people. There is a big conspiracy behind it. Also, the help of some media persons were sought. CPM should give a proper explanation on what was the purpose of the act,” he alleged. Surendran pointed out that Deshabhimani had used the copper plate inscription to undertake a campaign and added that BJP will take out strong protests if the government failed to act against those who tried to create rift among Sabarimala devotees. “The chief minister is maintaining a silence on the fake antiques scam as those having links with Monson are close to him. Monson committed frauds by using his relationships with those in positions of power,” Surendran added. Pandalam temple files plaint A complaint was lodged against Mavunkal at Pandalam police station in Pathanamthitta district on Monday regarding the authenticity of the copper plate inscription on Sabarimala in his possession. G Prithvipal, president of the advisory committee of Valiya Koyikkal temple in Pandalam, in his complaint filed against Mavunkal said that the copper plate, which was mentioned as an authentic document about the Sabarimala temple in a section of media, brought insult to the traditions of the hill shrine, tantri family and to the Pandalam palace. “That was a fake document and it hurt the sentiments of many, especially during December 2018 when there were many controversies related to the temple,” Prithvipal added. He said in the complaint that the ‘fake document’ was the result of a conspiracy aimed at creating religious hatred and hurting religious sentiments. In such a situation those involved should be charged as per the IPC, said his complaint. Speaking to TOI, Prithvipal said that he will approach higher police authorities or move court if his complaint is ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/monson-acted-on-behalf-of-ldf-govt-says-surendran/articleshow/86761771.cms||---
---||India||Pakistani soldier killed in North Waziristan terror attack||ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan army soldier was killed during a shootout with alleged terrorists in the country’s volatile North Waziristan tribal district, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) — the military’s media wing — claimed on Monday. In a statement, ISPR said the terrorists targeted a security check-post in North Waziristan’s Ghariuom area. Security forces responded promptly to the assault and Sepoy Muhammad Amir Iqbal (30) was killed in the ensuing fire exchange. Troops have launched an anti-operation in the area, the statement added. The attack comes two days after terrorists targeted a vehicle of the Frontier Corps — a paramilitary force — in Spinwam, North Waziristan, killing four soldiers and a sub-inspector of the levies force. That strike was followed up by a statement that a clearance operation was underway to eliminate “any terrorist found in the area.” While no group has claimed responsibility for the strikes, it occurred a day after Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of Shura-i-Mujahideen, one of the factions of Pakistani Taliban, announced a ceasefire for 20 days. It followed Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan’s claim that his government would offer amnesty to members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who were willing to lay down their arms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistani-soldier-killed-in-north-waziristan-terror-attack/articleshow/86763398.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Lucknow||Piped supply plugs holes, raises groundwater levels||Lucknow: Ensuring piped water supply to as many blocks as possible and improvement in irrigation schemes have helped in stabilising groundwater levels in as many as 35 districts of Uttar Pradesh since 2017. The centrally-funded Atal Bhujal Yojana was initially implemented in water-stressed areas of seven states, including 10 districts of Uttar Pradesh. These included 26 blocks and 550 gram panchayats in Mahoba, Jhansi, Banda, Hamirpur, Chitrakoot, Lalitpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Baghpat and Meerut districts. Satisfied with the impact of the scheme in these districts, the state government decided to extend the scheme to the remaining 65 districts. From April 1 this year, all 826 blocks in the state are being covered under the scheme for improvement in groundwater levels. The scheme will run till 2026 under which the government will focus on developing a water security plan, followed by work in the 75 over-exploited blocks in the second year, critical blocks in the third and semi-critical blocks in the fourth year. Principal secretary, Namami Gange, Anurag Srivastava said, “Improvement in groundwater levels is the result of a multi-focus approach by the government. Due to this, around 82 blocks that were either critical or overexploited have seen an improvement.” “Conservation efforts like afforestation on a large scale, rehabilitation of village ponds through MNREGA and state funds, and construction of check dams have shown a massive improvement. Another major step taken by the government was to ban new borings by industrial units in overexploited areas. As soon as excessive withdrawal of water from the ground stopped, the resources were replenished,” he said. “The new law requires applications to be made on a specified portal and the rejection rate is about 30-35%,” Srivastava said, asserting that there was absolute transparency in renewal of licences for industrial extraction of groundwater. Meanwhile, UP has also secured top position in the implementation of Atal Bhujal Yojana. Under the centrally-sponsored scheme, the government initiated groundwater conservation measures, conducted awareness programmes and made interventions on the demand and supply side. This also included geotagging of ponds and check dams which are maintained by the government. A government spokesperson said groundwater exploitation had intensified with the spread of hand pumps across the state. “Even now, while piped water is being provided to districts where supply is low, around 27 lakh hand pumps are in operation in UP,” he added. “UP has a large area where groundwater is available in abundance, easily accessible and of good quality. But there are some regions which face issues related to the quality of groundwater, especially the presence of arsenic and fluoride. Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions have hilly terrain where the availability of groundwater is neither good nor perennial. This is the reason why the Har Ghar Nal Scheme started with this region,” he said. Curbing Overexploitation Of Water · Centrally-sponsored Atal Bhujal Yojana implemented in 10 districts · Govt extended similar schemes to remaining 65 districts in April this year · Since 2017, groundwater levels in 35 districts have shown improvement · New law introduced to prohibit fresh borings for industrial use in overexploited zones · Conservation efforts included afforestation, construction of check dams, desilting of village ponds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/piped-supply-plugs-holes-raises-groundwater-levels/articleshow/86762598.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He, however, said things are under control in the district despite having the highest population in the state. He claimed that out of 309 patients, 301 have been recovered, while five patients are still hospitalised. The city has reported only one dengue death so far. "We have been focussing on anti larva spray and the exercise is being conducted at Shivkuti, Govindpur, Naini, Arail, PAC colony, Om Gayatri nagar, Shiv mandir, LIG colony, Income tax colony, Melaroad, CMP degree college, Chaudhary crossing, Chota Baghara, and other adjoining areas," said health department officials. To check the spread of dengue, health teams are also interacting with residents, particularly of those areas which have reported more than five cases within a fortnight, and appealing them to take preventive measures against the mosquito-borne viral diseases. Ironically, increase in number of cases have been detected in urban areas as more than a dozen urban pockets have turned to be a safe hub for mosquito breeding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/10-new-dengue-cases-in-prayagraj-tally-at-309/articleshow/86761770.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Take small steps for a giant leap in water conservation||Drop Cap Many a little makes a mickle. We all know it but seldom practice. But in case of water, if we do not practice it now, our own survival will be endangered because localized exploitation of resources, increasing pollution, urbanization and challenges due to the rapidly changing climate, per capita availability of fresh water has been decreasing. The government currently has in place some efforts to implement solutions. One major programme, Jal Jeevan Mission, seeks to promote universal access to adequate and safe water throughout the year in one’s household through improved management and equitable distribution. Meeting this objective is also critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 6 target for universal and equitable access to safe drinking water by 2030. While drinking water is essential for human life, much of our water footprint results from non-potable, or non-drinking, uses. There is significant potential to save thousands of litres each day through individual action. Treatment of water is important before it can be reused. (Calculation of quantity of water is an approximation based on certain assumptions and data available from different sources available in public domain.) One a Day, For Everyone: If we save just one litre of water everyday, or five litres in a family of five, without compromising hygiene and health, we can save 1.3 billion litres. This is equivalent to creating one Matatila (Jhansi) dam every 18 months or one Dal lake every two years. We can adopt simple practices like repairing/replacing leaking tap, turning off the tap while applying soap and scrubbing, using greywater (water used for washing vegetables) for watering plants or pet/livestock water needs, among others. Use of greywater for toilet flushing: Currently, we use clean water – sometimes of drinking quality – to flush toilets. If we assume about 75% of the Indian population flushes at least once in a day (a very conservative estimate), which uses at least 5 litres each time, it adds up for a population of over 1,300,000,000 people! If we can invest in systems that redirect shower and laundry water to toilet tanks, with some treatment built in, we could save another 1,779 million cubic metres of potable water each year. This is equivalent to creating two-and-half Matatila dams every year or daily domestic water requirement (@ 55 litre per person per day) of half of UP’s total rural population. Conservation through farm bunding: An old age practice of farm bunding before the onset of monsoon in rainfed rural areas has almost disappeared. There are about 77.1 million hectares of rainfed agriculture fields in India. If the farmers put one foot high farm bunds around the periphery of 50% of their field, we can save 115,650 million cubic metres of water every year, which is 163 Matatila dams of Jhansi or daily domestic water need of all people of India (@55 litre per day per person) for four years. Car mopping, not washing: Approximately 36% of Indian families (88.8 million) have at least one four/three/two-wheelers. Maybe one out of four vehicles are washed daily and each effort consumes at least 10 litres. If this habit is replaced by mopping for six days and washing once a week, 60 million cubic metres of water can be saved. This is sufficient to meet the drinking water requirement (@ 1.5 litre per child per day and 220 days of school days in a year) of 84% of all school children (government and private; classes 1-12) of UP. Save water in schools: It is estimated that there are 2650 million children in 1.5 million schools of India (UDISE, 2019-20). Children and school staff wash hands with soap during lunch break and after using the toilet, fill water bottles or directly drink water through tap or hand pump. To balance the loss, it is possible to establish systems for greywater that can be used for watering plants in schools. If 50% of children adopt water-saving behaviour and greywater generated is used for watering the plant after appropriate treatment, the freshwater saved would be equivalent to constructing rainwater harvesting systems in 1.5 million schools, assuming an average room catchment area is of 150 square metres. Schemes like Jal Jeevan Mission, supported by partners like UNICEF, will help with both conservation and minimizing the burden on individuals, especially women and girls, for traversing distances to source clean water.

He has been given the benefit of doubt as the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charges. The accused, Rafique Ansari , was acquitted last week by the additional sessions judge, SP Godhalekar. Another alleged accused Abdul Ajij Chotu Shaikh was also tried along with him but as he died during pendency of trial the case against him was abetted by the court. The prosecutor told the court that it was on October 04,2015 a rickshaw driver had gone for fishing near the Kokni Kabrastan on the Idgha road and witnessed that one person was lying in the Kabrastan badly injured and another person also injured was lying besides him. He alerted the police who rushed the two injured to the hospital where doctors declared both brought dead. One of the dead was identified as Minarul Ilahi Shaikh, resident of Shantinagar, Mankhurd, Mumbai. The other dead man was identified as Laxman Burman. There were injuries on his head, ear, eyes, abdomen. Lemons, black colour doll and nail was found on Shaikh. During the course of the probe, the police arrested the duo and charged them under various sections of the IPC and black magic act. The judge heard the prosecution's version but while acquitting the accused, in his order, the judge punched several holes in the prosecution theory, in his order the judge noted “..the C.A. (chemical analyses) report on record relating to clothes of the deceased and the samples collected from the place discloses human blood detection. However, clothes of the accused does not show any detection of human blood. In short, this C.A. report on record are of no use to connect the accused with the alleged incident.” The judge further added, “..though different articles like lemon, black colour doll, nail and other thins found on spot being a chance to say that those were brought to practice to promote propagate or practiced human sacrifice and other inhuman, evil and aghori practices and black magic, there is no concrete evidence to show that accused persons and deceased had come there solely for that purpose and thereafter some dispute occurred between them and the co-­accused committed their murder.” Ansari, was tried for the offences various offences in including murder of Indian Penal Code along with some other sections of Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-man-held-for-twin-murder-in-graveyard-is-acquitted/articleshow/86761775.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

At a protest at Jantar Mantar, AAP demanded that Union minister Ajay Mishra be immediately sacked and his son be sent to jail. The Uttar Pradesh and central governments are trying to suppress the case of violence against farmers, alleged Bharadwaj. The internet services have been suspended in the area, he claimed. “Ajay Mishra had himself threatened the farmers a few days ago and said you should find out what Ajay Mishra was before becoming a minister and an MP,” Bharadwaj said. AAP’s Gopal Rai said both UP and central governments weren’t ready to talk to farmers, but were always ready to attack them. The party lit candles at the protest site to pay tributes to the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/denied-entry-into-lakhimpur-claims-aap/articleshow/86761805.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Sachin Pilot demands probe by SC judge in Gujarat port drugs haul||MUMBAI: Rajasthan Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Monday demanded a judicial probe by a sitting Supreme Court judge in the seizure of drugs worth Rs 21,000 crore from Gujarat’s Mundra port. “It’s more than a fortnight now since the Narcotics Control Bureau and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence seized heroin worth Rs 21,000 crore, but since then, we did not hear from the investigating agencies. The NDA government must come out with a clear statement on the present status of the probe and who had actually secured the drugs,” Pilot said during a press conference at the party office in Mumbai. On September 17, the Gujarat DRI had seized nearly 3,000kg of heroin from two containers at the Adani-operated Mundra port in Kutch. The banned drug is believed to have been smuggled from Afghanistan. Pointing out that besides the Centre, even the BJP-ruled Gujarat government has maintained a discreet silence on the incident, Pilot said: “Several questions have been raised over the manner in which the Gujarat port received heroin from Afghanistan. While it was delivered in Gujarat, the owners of the firm, who booked the shipment, are from Andhra Pradesh. Then the moot question is why the drugs were received in Mundra port.” He alleged that all efforts are being made to suppress the entire case for obvious political reasons as so far, no action has been taken. “I am doubtful if a preliminary probe has been initiated in the case. We demand that the central government appoint a sitting judge of the Supreme Court for conducting an inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry Act,” the Congress leader said. Pilot alleged that in the recent past, drugs worth Rs 1 lakh crore was imported in India and more shocking was the fact that neither the BJP-ruled Gujarat nor the NDA government at the Centre have initiated stringent measures to halt such imports. “The NDA government must book the mastermind involved in importing the drugs, which is destroying our young generation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pilot-demands-probe-by-sc-judge-in-guj-port-drugs-haul/articleshow/86761793.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The bishop has reminded all Catholic churches of the five districts of Nashik, Dhule, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon and Nandurbar that the pandemic is not yet over and they need to adhere the Covid-appropriate behaviour laid down by the state government. The bishop’s guidelines include restricting the number of participants for the Mass, while stating that sprinkling of holy water must not take place — except for babies during baptism, couples during weddings and funerals. The churches have to ensure that no one is allowed to enter the premises without a mask and the churches must be sanitised and kept clean. They also have to make arrangements for thermal scanning and hand sanitisation. The bishop said the churches should have two-three choir members, who will lead the congregation in singing instead of the regular choir groups. On Sundays and feast days, the gap between Masses in the churches must be at least of one hour. No one should be allowed to touch the statues. According to him, the celebration of the Sunday Mass liturgy in churches should be from Saturday morning to Sunday evening. If required, the churches can increase the number of Masses. For the distribution of communion, the churches have been instructed to seek the help of the volunteers so that physical distancing is maintained. The priest distributing the communion must wear a mask. He said that the Nashik diocese will celebrate a memorial Mass for the departed brothers and sisters of the parishes who died in the pandemic and pray for the repose of their souls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sops-for-catholic-churches-in-n-maha-ahead-of-oct-7/articleshow/86760265.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||BEST buses to be 100% electric by 2028: Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray||MUMBAI: State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday said 100% of BEST’s fleet will be electric by 2028. Thackeray was speaking at an event at BMC’s headquarters, where three MoUs related to Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP) were signed on Monday. The action plan is being formulated by BMC along with the state environment ministry and World Resources Institute (WRI) India, which has been engaged as a technical partner. “The @myBESTBus has 386 EV buses currently and we are looking at 1900 EV buses & 200 double-decker buses, converting 50% fleet to electric by 2023 & 100% by 2028. @WRICitiesIndia & GiZ will optimize a smooth transition for the consumer and last-mile connectivity for BEST. As BMC focuses on making more urban forest thickets, we must ensure that we involve our citizens in planting trees native to Mumbai and cool the neighbourhoods. For us, development and sustainable living in Mumbai go hand in hand. Our policies and initiatives reflect this ethos. Taking this goal ahead facilitated the signing of 3 MoUs, to further strengthen Mumbai Climate Action Plan,” Aaditya tweeted. The MoUs signed include Women for Climate, Cities for Forests Campaign and the e-Bus Mission. The e-Bus Mission is an agreement under Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative (TUMI) to upgrade BEST buses. Under it, best resources will be provided along with technical assistance by WRI India, BMC said. “The number of electric buses is constantly increasing at BEST. The experience of WRI, an international organization, will be crucial in providing technical assistance to BEST administration in planning for infrastructure, performance appraisal and civic policy planning and other issues for charging BEST buses. It will provide easy, easy technical guidance for BEST to convert from traditional buses to electric buses, as well as encourage at least five small towns to adopt electric buses in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-buses-to-be-100-electric-by-2028-aaditya/articleshow/86762902.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The study, which involved closely observing 227 patients of ulcerative colities (UC), was done by Rajkot-based gastroenterologist Dr KK Rawal. The study published in the reputed Indian Journal of Gastroenterology was aimed at finding out the side-effects of UC and the subsequent surgeries, mainly that of appendix, carried out in some patients. According to doctors, the clinical manifestations of UC are not only restricted to the large intestine but a significant number of patients saw their organs like joints, skin, eyes, liver and blood vessels too getting involved. The side-effects prove dangerous even fatal if not diagnosed and treated in time. The patient risks losing an eye, becoming disabled permanently or suffering from very painful arthritis. Involvement of liver can be fatal as also vascular complications which results in blood clotting Importantly, the study has revealed that the side-effects of UC were more common in patients who undergo operation of appendicitis, the inflammation of appendix, considered a vestigial organ that doesn’t carry out any functions. The inflammation in this organ results in extreme abdominal pain following which most patients get it removed. The study suggests that removing appendix from the body is a risk factor for the side-effects which are termed as extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) in medical parlance. A significant finding of the study was that the side-effects were most likely to be found in skin, followed by joints, eyes, liver and blood vessels. Rajkot was chosen for this largest prospective single-center study in India designed specifically to find the presence of EIM in UC and risk factors. According to Dr. Rawal, the most common age group affected by the disease is between 20 years to 40 years, although the disease can occur in a child of 30 days and a person of 90 years too. In this disease, ulcers and inflammation are found in the large intestine and rectum. According to study, out of 18 patients with side-effects of UC, every third had undergone surgery for appendicitis. “Early diagnosis and treatment of side-effects can make life better for the patients.” Dr Rawal added. The other doctors co-authored this paper are Dr. Varun Shukla . Dr. Shabbir Chikani, Dr. Milan Thakkar, Dr. Mukesh Ruparelia and Dr. Rajesh Chudasama.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/intestinal-ulcers-can-affect-eyes-joints-liver-too-study/articleshow/86760274.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Delhi||Supreme Court issues notice to 43 farm groups over blockades||NEW DELHI: As the Centre and concerned states failed to find a solution to end the blockade of roads at Delhi borders by farm unions protesting against the three agriculture laws, the Supreme Court on Monday decided to issue notice to farm organisations as pleaded by the Haryana government. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh that an application has been filed by the state to implead 43 organisations in the petition filed by a Noida-based women for removal of road blockade on Delhi borders. Mehta told the bench that the state government appointed a committee to hold talks with agitating farmers but they refused to participate. The court had earlier asked the Centre to find a solution after holding that public roads cannot be blocked for a long period to cause inconvenience to the general public and there should be free flow of traffic. It had asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to explore the solution in consultation with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments. The court had earlier also said there cannot be continuing inconvenience for people for a long time by the agitators by blocking the roads and some arrangements had to be made so that people do not suffer. The court was hearing a plea of a Noida-based woman who alleged that it took her more than two hours to commute due to the road block. She alleged in her petition that she was a single parent and it had become a nightmare to travel to Delhi. She alleged that agitation was being done to defame the government and the country. The Supreme Court had last year ruled that authorities, in future, should not permit Shaheen Bagh-type protests involving blocking of roads and public spaces, and said that such expressions of dissent should be organised at designated places without causing inconvenience to the public at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-issues-notice-to-43-farmgroups-over-blockades/articleshow/86761823.cms||---

District collector Rajendra Bhosale said the restrictions are into effect and will continue till the midnight of October 13. “All non-essential establishments in these villages, including educational institutes, will remain closed during this period. The chemist shops will be allowed to operate. We have taken this step to curb the spread of the infection,” he added. The grocery shops in these villages will be allowed to operate for three hours from 8am, but the staff has to be fully vaccinated. The milk collection centres are also allowed to function. The positivity rate in Ahmednagar is presently over 5%. The present active cases are over 3,900 and 3.1% of the patients are critical, undergoing treatment in intensive care units of hospitals. The administration is conducting around 15,000 Covid tests a day at present and the daily positive cases hover around 600-800. Of the 61 villages where the restrictions have been imposed, the highest number (24) of villages is in Sangamner taluka, followed by nine in Shrigonda taluka and seven in Rahata taluka. Zilla Parishad CEO Rajendra Kshirsagar said that ZP health workers will continue to aggressively carry out contact tracing and testing in these villages. “If we see a rising trend of Covid cases in any other village, we will impose similar restrictions in those villages too in the future,” he added. The ZP CEO said that bulk of those testing positive for Covid are unvaccinated and some are partially vaccinated. The district collector had a meeting with the ZP CEO and district superintendent of police Manoj Patil, before announcing the restrictions. The local police will be deployed at the entry/exit points of these villages to curb unnecessary movement of people and vehicles into and out of these villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fresh-covid-curbs-in-61-ahmednagar-villages/articleshow/86760287.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: On GMLR flyover, permanent ban on motorcycles likely as month-long restriction sees 0 crashes||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Traffic Police are likely to permanently prohibit movement of motorcycles on the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR) flyover after a month-long ban resulted in zero crashes. Heavy vehicles were banned right after inauguration of the bridge as a high-tension wire runs above it. Other stretches where motorcycles are not permitted to ply include JJ flyover, Eastern Freeway, Bandra-Worli Sealink and BKC-Chunabhatti connector. TimesViewTwo-wheeler riders have been flouting the ban for the past month as the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road flyover cuts travel time massively. If the traffic police intend to implement the ban, enforcement will have to be strict. Simultaneously, the stretch underneath the GMLR flyover, uneven in parts and filled with potholes, needs to be fixed so motorcyclists are not at risk.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the GMLR flyover on August 1. By the end of the month, 30 crashes (seven of them major) were reported. Among them was a fatal mishap of timber trader Yusuf Khan on August 30. Khan was seated pillion on a friend's motorcycle when it skidded and he was thrown off. On September 2, the traffic police came out with a notification restricting two wheelers, pedestrians and cyclists from using the bridge for a month, in addition to heavy vehicles that were already prohibited. While only light vehicles were allowed, some motorcyclists continued to flout the ban. "We started a strict crackdown against those flouting the ban and more than 300 motorcyclists faced action within a week," said a police officer. The BMC simultaneously started work to make the flyover safer. "We carried out milling work besides placing speed breakers," said a civic official. Signage was also placed. Rama Ramchandran, who lives a few yards away from the flyover, said traffic movement is better now compared to earlier. "There have been a series of text messages doing the rounds since the fatal mishap (of Khan) and that appears to have resulted in more cautiousness among motorists," she said. "We are mulling a permanent prohibition on motorcycles as well as heavy vehicles on GMLR flyover as the month-long ban resulted favourably with zero crashes," said Baliram Dhas, senior inspector, Mankhurd traffic police. Two-wheeler riders criticised the decision as harsh. "The road beneath is now used for parking garbage trucks, dumping debris or for other activities. In some sections, the median is also used for parking. The condition of the road beneath the flyover is not at all safe for motorcyclists as it is uneven in some stretches and has potholes," said a regular biker. Incidentally, the area is used extensively by heavy vehicles and some locals were hoping trucks would be allowed to ply on the GMLR flyover. "The BMC is expected to have qualified engineers who should have planned work anticipating that there is a high tension wire above the bridge. We were told during the construction stage of the flyover that vehicles going into the dumping ground would move smoothly once the bridge is ready," said Sharma. BMC needs to construct a pier at the location over which the high tension wire would go. They need an area of 225 sq meters which falls in the jurisdiction of the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-gmlr-flyover-no-entry-for-bikes-likely-as-mth-long-ban-sees-0-mishaps/articleshow/86762915.cms||Nitasha Natu

Accompanied by more than a dozen senior party leaders, including Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap and working president Charansingh Sapra, Patole and Pilot staged demonstrations near Mantralaya to protest against the “high-handedness” of a Union minister and his son who allegedly ran his car over agitating farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. The party also condemned the UP police action of detaining Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi who was heading to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the farmers. “Gandhi was accompanied by only two activists, including Rajya Sabha MP Deependar Singh Hooda. There was no violation of rules, but still police stopped her from reaching the village,” Patole said, adding that ever since Modi took over the reins of the nation, he has consistently taken anti-farmer decisions. “Whatever has happened in UP...reflects the Talibani mentality of the BJP. We demand that both the NDA and UP governments should be dismissed with immediate effect,” Patole said, adding that the Congress will soon give a call for a Maharashtra bandh in support of agitating farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-seeks-dismissal-of-modi-yogi-govts-over-up-violence/articleshow/86761813.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Bhopal||151 cyber-crime cases reported on 24x7 Bhopal helpline in 78 days||BHOPAL: The pandemic-triggered lockdown that confined families to their homes resulting in a sharp decline in thefts and normal crimes however witnessed a surge in cyber crimes as more and more people shifted to online platforms. If police statistics during the last six months are considered at least two cases were reported daily. Complaints of cyber frauds during the lockdown are still being reported to the police daily. Keeping this in mind, cyber-crime branch Bhopal had started a 24X7 helpline three months ago. Since the start of the helpline on July 14, police have received 151 cyber-crime complaints in 78 days. Acting swiftly on complaints, cops blocked Rs 8.41 lakh from the accounts of online fraudsters, which was later refunded to the victims. 16 FIRs have been registered based on complaints received through the helpline. Police officers appeal to the cyber-crime case victims to report the incident on the helpline as soon as it happens, so that the money siphoned by the accused cyber-fraudsters could be traced and accounts freezed. SP (South) Sai Krishna S Thota said, in cyber-fraud cases, the initial 3-4 hours after the incident are very crucial. Once the cyber-criminals withdraw money from their bank accounts, it becomes very difficult to recover it. In many cyber-crime cases reported to police, it was seen that the victims delayed approaching police, which gave ample time to the fraudsters to withdraw the money from their bank accounts. To address this problem, the cyber-crime branch started the cyber-crime helpline for people on July 14. In case of any cyber-crime, people can now immediately inform police on Helpline Number - 0755-2920664, WhatsApp number - 9479990636 or email their complaints on dspcrimebho@mp.gov.in. SOPs have been developed for each modus operandi of cyber-crime cases reported on the helpline, which cyber-police teams follow. The teams coordinate with banks and other payment gateways and freeze money in the accounts it was transferred by the accused, said the SP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/151-cyber-crime-cases-reported-on-24x7-bhopal-helpline-in-78-days/articleshow/86761800.cms||Sudeept Mishra

Teachers and non-teaching staff of schools were excited to have the students back — an indication that things were returning to normal, albeit with new norms of physical distancing, sanitisation and masks. The joy of seeing their friends, classrooms and school environment after many months was visible on the faces of the students. “We saw each other through the mobile screens all these days. Today, we were so excited to meet. To see how we look after almost two years. However, more importantly, I was so happy to get out of home for school. It was a great day today,” Santosh Patil, one of the students, said. It was a quiet affair as the school bell rang on Monday for assembly - as against the usual practice of children shouting their way to the classrooms. Students could not hide their disappointment of not being able to greet friends with a tight hug, or even hand shake. “We miss the opportunity to hug and greet our friends, to huddle and chat. It hurts,” said Sonali Kamble, another student from one of the NMC schools. In some schools, the teachers played the drums to welcome the students, while some held placards welcoming the children on the first day of school. Some teachers performed ‘aarti’ of the students of Class 8 – 10 in the city areas and Class 5 - 7 in the rural areas. “We sincerely hope that normalcy returns at the earliest. We hope schools will soon once again bloom with more children as the classes for the others open up step by step,” said Swamini Wagh, headmistress (secondary), Boys Town Public School. The students themselves appeared to be very cautious by ensuring safe distance and no-hugging right from the first hour. The situation was similar in the rural areas with the children in classes 5 – 7 returning to classes. The teachers welcomed the children with flowers and even decorated their classes. Teachers in Wanarwadi school in Dindori taluka greeted the children of Class VI with the flowers.

Kumar said Congressmen would not allow the sacrifices of farmers go unrewarded. He claimed that over 600 farmers have lost their lives in their fight for justice, but the Centre has been unmoved by their plight. The DPCC chief said the violence witnessed in Lakhimpur Kheri was a bid to break the morale and resilience of the farmers. Alleging that democracy has been murdered as citizens have lost their rights to voice against injustice, Kumar said despite the Supreme Court taking cognisance of the farmers’ agitation, and directing the Centre to find a solution, the Modi government has not yet acted.

---||Pune||Reaction from ZyCov-D Pune trial: no fever, fatigue or pain||Some of the common side-effects of the Covid vaccine — redness or soreness at the site of vaccination and low-grade fever/fatigue within 24 to 48 hours of the shots — were not observed in the advanced trials of ZyCoV-D vaccine among adolescents in Pune. None of the 47 adolescents receiving the three-dose, needle-free, intra-dermal vaccine at Dr D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital as part of the countrywide trials complained of these common side-effects, trial researchers told TOI ahead of the ZyCoV-D’s nationwide rollout this month. The ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the first in the country to have received emergency use authorisation (EUA) for use on people aged 12 years and above. ZyCoV-D is a plasmid DNA vaccine, which produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It provides for ease of manufacturing with minimal biosafety requirements, and doesn’t have any problems associated with vector-based immunity. “Some of the commonly seen side-effects post-vaccination like fever, fatigue and other flu-like symptoms were not at all observed in the trial adolescents who received three doses of ZyCoV-D 28 days apart,” said Shalaka Agarkhedkar, D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital’s trial research consultant. Agarkhedkar added: “Typically, a small amount of pain or redness is expected with an intramuscular (IM) vaccine having a needle. But this common vaccination site complaint was not reported even by a single adolescent trial participant at our trial site in Pune. ZyCoV-D is a needle-free vaccine given just below the skin and not deep into the muscles with a specially designed jet injector. Few adolescents reported only a slight pinching sensation while receiving the shot.” The needle-free intradermal vaccine is a shallow or superficial injection into the dermis, located between the epidermis and the hypodermis. This route is relatively rare compared to injections, Agarkhedkar said. Dr D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital, and Bharati Medical College and Hospital in Pune were among the 50 trial sites in India where of 1,600 adolescents between 12 and 17 years had participated. Zydus Cadila, in association with the Nashik-based HCG Manavata Cancer Centre, also performed clinical trials of the vaccine on 300 adolescents between 12 and 17 years in Nashik city. A company official said the trials were successful and there had been no reports of adverse effects. The trial enrolment of adolescents began in early March and the last trial participant received the last (third) dose on September 23 this year. The adolescents are from different socio-economic strata. Some of the families have an annual income of Rs 2 lakh and a few of Rs 70 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/reaction-from-zycov-d-pune-trial-no-fever-fatigue-or-pain/articleshow/86761840.cms||Umesh Isalkar

We are not in a hurry. We will see and then decide when to start our school,” principal of one of the ICSE schools in the city said. One school has decided to call students for examination only. “We will take a call of opening schools only after Diwali. We have completed our portion through online classes and conducted revisions.

The police on Monday brought the accused for evidence collection at the crime scene and recovered the hammer, knife and other weapons he had used to kill the boy and injure his (the boy’s) mother and grandmother on Sunday. The victim’s family was known to him. The incident took place around 3.30am on Sunday. According to Idukki deputy SP Immanuel Paul, the accused first attacked the mother and then the minor boy. He then went to the house of the boy’s grandmother and attacked her. He also forcefully took a girl related to the boy to the grandmother’s house and attacked her. The girl managed to escape later and informed nearby residents. “The accused dragged the girl to the house where the boy and his mother were lying in a pool of blood and then sexually abused her in a nearby shed. He planned to escape with the minor girl. A Pocso case has been filed against him,” said the officer. The accused and another woman related to the boy’s family were living together. This woman had left him recently and this was the provocation for the violent incident. The accused planned to kill all members of both families and had completed all arrangements, Paul said. Both the accused and the woman had previous marriages. Seven years ago, they started living together. She had evicted him from her home last week. The accused is a resident of Mlamala near Vandiperiyar and had moved here years ago after he and the woman started a new relationship. The accused has another wife and children in Vandiperiyar, said the officer. Meanwhile, the boy’s body was handed over to his relatives after autopsy on Monday.

---||Rajkot||Girl’s attempt to enact suicide ends in her death||Rajkot: An 11-year-old girl’s attempt to enact a suicide scene in front of her younger siblings ended in a tragedy. The girl was killed after she accidentally hanged herself at her home in the city’s Ranchhodnagar on October 2. Police confirmed the incident on Monday after the post-mortem examination showed that the girl had died due to hanging and her younger sisters too confirmed that she was demonstrating the act. The girls’ parents were not at home when the tragic incident happened. The girl identified as Samiksha Lohar told her sisters that she will show them how to hang oneself to death at home on the evening of October 2. According to the deceased’s sisters, the girl tied a ‘dupatta’ to a cross iron bar of a door in the house and made a noose to tie around her neck. The girl then climbed on a vessel and put the noose around her neck. However, the vessel slipped as the girl lost balance and the noose of the ‘dupatta’ strangulated her. Police officials said that the younger siblings failed to realize the gravity of the situation and may have assumed that the girl was merely putting up an act. However, when their parents returned home, they were shocked to find the girl’s body hanging. Cops initially suspected foul play, but when the investigation revealed that it was an accident, they registered a case of accidental death. Police said that the girl’s father works as a security guard and the family hails from Nepal. They had moved to Rajkot and were living in an apartment in Ranchhodnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/girls-attempt-to-enact-suicide-ends-in-her-death/articleshow/86760313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Family businesses master art of diversification||Labour was in plenty and cheap when late Lala Shiv Dayal Kapoor and his son entered the carpet business about 50 years ago. Handwoven carpets commanded a premium and exports were a heady business. When Gaurav, Shiv Dayal’s grandson joined the business, the heydays were just not over then. "We literally had buyers lining up outside the factory. We enjoyed a great monopoly," recalls Gaurav. The carpets were hand-knotted. Rajasthan being a desert state, and agri-activities were limited in scope, labour was always at hand. But it seems a lot has changed despite the Kapoors setting up looms in and around the villages to mobilize more labour. "Instead of the labourers coming to our factories, we started going to them. Production grew. The shift in strategy worked very well for many years and is still a major source but currently getting new labour into the system at an affordable cost has become a challenge," said Gaurav. The pandemic has further strained the carpet demand in exporting markets like the US, Spain, Germany, and France. But being an entrepreneurial family, new ideas are not in short supply. That even extends to Gaurav’s wife, Tina who has recently tried her hands in textiles and is finding traction in the market. "Carpet knotting requires long hours and the new generation of labourers look for quick results. We needed a change and decided to diversify the business into the textile sector. That’s how Kapoor Carpet and Textiles took shape," says Tina, who holds a degree in textiles designing. She brought in a modern and contemporary touch to the traditional art of block printing. The family skills of carpet wool dyeing for creating new shades and combinations found their way into the textile products like garden umbrellas, table linen, bathrobes, quilts and cushion covers, etc. "We worked with the old community of cheepas, traditionally known for their printing skills. Together, we embarked on a new journey taking the family business to a new level. We set up printing tables around the looms in the villages. We roped in the women to carry out checking, packaging and stitching", adds Tina. To win over the workers, the company has also taken initiatives like providing education to their children. "This has become our way of promoting the business and uplifting our artisans," says Tina. During the lockdown, the production did not suffer as workers in their homes continued to produce pieces. "Home furnishing demand surged during the pandemic and we had enough production to cater to the rising demand," says Tina. Today, the fourth generation has joined the family business. "It’s our legacy which has withstood the test of times. Our son Virain has already joined the business and daughter Tanya is all set to do so after her studies in fashion art," says Tina.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/family-businesses-master-art-of-diversification/articleshow/86761875.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The joy of coming back to school was evident not only on the faces of the student, but also of the teachers. Saloni Vibhute, a Class VIII student from a city-based school, said, “It is a great feeling to meet my friends and teachers after a huge gap. Although I have been in this school since kindergarten, I felt a bit nervous today while preparing for the school. I had a new student kind of feeling today.” Some schools had also arranged for drums and dhol taasha to welcome the students. Deepak Kumbhar, a teacher, said, “Our school welcomed the students to the tunes of dhol tasha. A rose each was also given to every student. Thermal screening and sanitizer was also provided when the students entered the school premises and this practice will be continue hence forth.” Sandhya Chougale, principal of Princess Padmaraje Girls’ High School and Junior College, said, “According to state government guidelines, school can conduct physical classes for students from Std VIII to XII. The classes for students from St VIII to X were held in the noon session while junior college commenced in the morning session. Parents have also given consent to start the school.” Most of the parents from the city preferred to to drop their children to the school on their first day.

October 19 being Miladi un Nabi, students may not come to colleges on October 18. This will extend the holiday by two more days. Even if we allow first-year students in hostels, they will have to return home for six days. Instead, we asked them to attend classes on the campus from November. “Meanwhile, final year students will complete their practical work and return home. This will also ensure enough space to accommodate the freshers,” he added.Regional joint director of collegiate education R Ulagi said that the state government has asked colleges to call students for offline classes based on the availability of adequate space and classrooms to ensure that social distancing is maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/colleges-hesitate-to-begin-offline-classes-for-first-year-students/articleshow/86761853.cms||---

While there were 310 such petitions seeking houses, there were 45 requesting for house pattas, 52 seeking employment while the remaining 84 petitions had various other requests. Sameeran asked the officials from the respective departments to address the grievances without delay.A group of nadaswaram and thavil artistes attempted to perform in front of the collectorate to draw the attention of officials about their plight.However, they were asked not to play the instruments and instead submit their petition. Subsequently, they submitted a petition seeking the government to provide them assistance as they have lost their livelihood due to the lockdown.“There are more than 400 artistes in Coimbatore district. We are dependent on orders to perform at temple festivals and weddings. But temple events were made low-key. Restrictions on the number of people in wedding ceremonies left us jobless,’’ president of the association for the musicians Andavan said.He wanted the government to provide them financial assistance, free bus pass and permission to perform in government functions. “If the government permits us to perform in official events, it will be a huge relief for us,” he said.Senior district administration officials and those from other departments were also present.

Buses to various parts of the city and rural areas, Udumalpet, Dindigul, Kothagiri and Vilathikulam in Tuticorin district and various places in Theni district are operated from the terminal, which records thousands of footfalls daily. However, facilities are strikingly inadequate. City buses allow passengers to board them only at the entry point of the terminal, where there are no shelters. A shopkeeper said, “On sunny days, passengers could be seen waiting under the shade of nearby trees. However, when it rains, they don’t have a place to escape the same. They have to take shelter on platform number four or nearby shops.” P Kayalvizhi, a passenger from Sulur, said only limited seating options were available on platform number four. “Most of the passengers have to stand for a long time. And water stagnates in front of it whenever it rains, adding to the woes of the passengers.” V Shanmugam, another regular passenger, said the terminal wasn’t clean as well. “In the absence of dust bins, people throw waste on its premises. While a couple of toilet facilities are available, many use open spaces to relieve themselves, as toilets are not clean. The free toilet at the exit point is badly maintained.” Another passenger said people spitting on the walls and premises of the bus terminal was very common. When contacted, a city corporation official said all the issues would be addressed soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/passengers-brave-rain-heat-as-ukkadam-bus-terminal-lacks-seating-shelter-facilities/articleshow/86761889.cms||V Devanathan

The villa is one of the residential premises of Notandas Jewellers. The report said that on September 23, the fire erupted from the electric duct on the first floor and spread rapidly into the lobby area, where the body of a 40-year-old woman was found later. A fire officer said that had the woman taken shelter in any of the rooms, it could have been possible to bring her out through a window. Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said the flames spread rapidly via the false ceiling and other interiors of the home. “There is more heat and smoke generated in the common areas as the fire was due to a defective electrical circuit in the duct,” he said. “As the windows had no grilles, we could bring out two persons, including the minor daughter of the deceased, using a turntable ladder.” A notice has been served to the residential premises over non-operational fire-fighting systems under Section 6 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety measures Act 2006. The Act states that it is the owners’ or occupiers’ liability to provide for fire prevention and life safety measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/defective-electric-circuit-caused-fatal-khar-blaze-fire-dept-report-in-mumbai/articleshow/86762934.cms||Richa Pinto

The hoardings and banners, installed by real estate developers, educational institutions and hospitals, began to appear a couple of months ago, commuters said. Unlike earlier, most of them are smaller in size. “There were hardly any banner on Sathy Road a few months ago. If the issue is not addressed promptly, it would endanger lives of commuters,” said P Balajinathan, a regular commuter. Given the heavy traffic and congested roads, even a microsecond of distraction is enough to cause accident, said Mohammed Sirajdeen, another commuter. “Authorities should take action if they are concerned about public safety.” Secretary of Coimbatore District Roads Protection Association M Devendran said that illegal banners and hoardings are seen on all stretches in the city. “I saw several of them on the roads connecting Vellakinar and Saravanampatti, Vilankurichi, Kalapatti and Saravanampatti. My complaints to officials, including those of Coimbatore city corporation, fell on deaf ears,” he told TOI. As per Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies Licensing of Hoardings and Levy and Collection of Advertisement Tax Rules, 2003, licence is mandatory to put up advertisements in public places.

Passengers booked on IndiGo departures out of Mumbai, scheduled from November onwards, will have to check their air tickets to confirm the terminal their flight will operate from.  T1-Parle will cater to approximately 156 flights daily, while T2-Sahar will handle about 396 flights, said MIAL. T1-Parle will have lounges, food and beverage outlets and 12 Covid testing booths across arrivals and departures for RT-PCR tests. With the nationwide vaccination drive and increase in passenger confidence in air travel, the airport decided to reopen T1-Parle once again, said the spokesperson. T1-Parle had shut down within a month after the Covid second wave hit air travel, bringing down passenger numbers, forcing the airport to consolidate all flights at T2-Sahar again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-flights-out-of-t1-vile-parle-to-resume-from-oct-20/articleshow/86761905.cms||---

They have decided to boycott the trainings, online meeting and e-Sanjeevani duties. The Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) started its non-cooperation strike by boycotting the extra works and without affecting the patient care. They have also decided to intensify the agitation from October 15 if their demands are not met. The doctors have threatened to boycott review meetings, VIP duty and meetings of the local self government department from October 15 onwards. If their grievances are still not addressed, they will hold a relay standing protest in front of Secretariat from November 1 and thereafter, on November 16 the doctors would go on a mass casual leave, the association leaders said. Since the Covid outbreak, the doctors and health workers have been working hard and sincerely to take care of those infected, despite lack of basic facilities. Despite working relentlessly by facing the challenges posed by the pandemic, not only were the doctors and health workers not provided any risk allowance, when the pay revision came, their salaries were also not increased and instead their various allowances were withdrawn by the state government, said the KGMOA in a statement. Meanwhile, the government medical college hospital doctors have also threatened to go on strike if the anomalies in the pay revision are not rectified. On October 21, they will protest in front of all the principal offices and before the directorate of medical education office in Thiruvananthapuram, demanding the rectification of the anomalies. The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA) in a statement issued here said despite repeated requests the government has not considered their demands. The government had implemented the pay revision in 2020 which was due in 2016. However, till date the government has not issued the pay slips to the doctors with the revised salaries. There are widespread anomalies in the pay revision such that in the entry cadre there has been a cut in the basic pay, said the association leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-doctors-begin-strike-to-intensify-protest-by-oct-15/articleshow/86761912.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Nirmal brings in tech, automation to family bottle biz, reduces labour, raises revenue||When P C Mundra ventured into manufacturing of spare parts for machines and equipment used in container glasses in 1978, he could not have imagined that his company would be one of the few to ride a new wave due to the Covid pandemic. He is no more, but his son Nirmal says that all the success they have earned stems from his father’s unique business idea. Nirmal Glasstech Industries does not make container glasses nor bottles but sells the technology and tools to manufacturers who make them. "We started with liquor bottles first, but then slowly diversified into many other applications. Over the last 15 years, cosmetic and perfume bottles have been our major volume driver. They are high-end products. The design technology fetches a better price," says Nirmal. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, businesses collapsed, economies went into a tailspin. But Nirmal says, the pandemic opened up new opportunities for the company. As demand for vaccine bottles increased, bottle manufacturers queued up at the company. "Before Covid, the vaccine segment was very small for us. As the Covid vaccine manufacturing started, demand for our technology increased. We supplied the technology to 46 countries in the world including three bottle manufacturers in India," says Nirmal. After dropping out of dental science studies in a medical college in Mumbai, Nirmal came to Jaipur to join his father in the business in 1995. He took some years to understand the business working alongside his father. "While working with him, I learnt the finer aspects of the business. During that time I also opted for an MBA course with an aim to expand the company’s marketing reach. But as I grew into the job, I started bringing in innovations in design, technology and automation," says Nirmal. The new systems, processes and automations helped him reduce workforce by over 30% even as the business grew manifold. "When my father was alive, we used to have over 500 employees but now that strength has come down to 300. On the other hand, our revenues have grown manifold to over Rs 100 crore. More than that, now our products are far superior quality-wise and the range has become very large. The time taken to design new tools has reduced significantly. Technology has been the key driver of these efficiencies and the reach. We are now exporting the technology to over 35 countries," added Nirmal. Nirmal says now the third generation has already entered the family business. Aditya, his son, who has done BBA in entrepreneurship from a US institute is now looking after day to day business activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nirmal-brings-in-tech-automation-to-family-bottle-biz-reduces-labour-raises-revenue/articleshow/86761911.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

But for many family businesses, it seems to be a natural path. Sambhav Papriwal, 36, had the comfort of settling into his father’s construction or food processing businesses. After all, he cut his teeth at the family ventures, but decided to branch out in 2007. In 13 years, Sambhav Natural Stones Pvt Ltd has come a long way. Sambhav is not an architect, but has become an architect’s delight. Sandstone wall murals, inlay flooring with decorative stone and metals, hand carved statues, stone carved in tapestry, designer furniture, outdoor vases or fireplaces have won him orders and applause. So far, Sambhav says, he has done over 60 projects, including hotels, temples, bungalows and farmhouses, to name a few. "During the days of grooming in my father’s construction business, I discovered an interest in decorative construction made of natural stones like marble, sandstone, and granite. The creative quest grew in me as I saw a few projects doing this kind of work. That was the trigger behind the venture," explains Sambhav. Today, he has about 10 ongoing projects including a temple in Mumbai and expects to have more of them as the waning pandemic opens up the economy to its capacity. While his younger brother Rishab has joined the family food processing business, Sambhav says family businesses are always alert to creating ventures for the siblings. His father Mani Bhadra Jain along with his two uncles started Sri Edibles Pvt Ltd in 1981. In 1991, his father again ventured into construction and real estate as he found that the family could manage new businesses. "What is important in family business is bonding among the members. That has been our strength. As of now the focus is on growing the existing businesses. Diversification helps. Sometimes, because of macroeconomic conditions, one sector may not always do well. That’s when the other ventures contribute and ensure smooth sailing," says Sambhav. Speaking about the future of the third generation, Sambhav says it is always the interest of the children. "One of my uncle’s (Subhadra Papriwal) children has taken interest in studies. Both his kids (son and daughter) are keen to crack the UPSC exams. We are happy that they are driven for a good purpose. If they decide to join the family business, they will do so and there will be a lot of support for them," says Sambhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sambhav-gives-a-decorative-push-to-construction-biz/articleshow/86761900.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Goa||After 2 FIRs against an accused, HC quashes 1||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has set aside an FIR in the Afghan national abduction case after it found that two separate FIRs with the same allegations were filed against the accused persons in two different police stations. Shapoor Zarifi, an Afghan national who resides in India as a refugee, came to Goa from Delhi on February 7, after he was promised employment in Toronto, Canada, by the accused persons, Rajat Kalyan and Saahil Kalyan, both from Haryana. Once Zarifi landed in Vasco, he was taken to a bungalow in Porvorim and held captive there. On February 11, an FIR was registered at Vasco police station, alleging that offences punishable under Sections 364A, 365 (abduction and confinement), 394, 465, 471 and 120-B, read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), were committed. Two days later, Zarifi’s statement was recorded under Section 161, CrPC. Based on his statement, another person, Karman Preet Singh, was rescued from Porvorim. After this, another FIR was registered, this time at the Porvorim police station, against the petitioners and other accused persons. The second FIR pertained to the same sections of the IPC as the first, against the same persons. The Kalyans’ lawyer, Arun Bras de Sa, submitted that the second FIR’s registration was incompetent because of ‘sameness of allegations’. Public prosecutor S G Bhobe didn’t seriously dispute the sameness, but said the chargesheet filed in the second FIR need not be quashed. Bhobe said that the interests of justice would be met if both chargesheets are consolidated and tried at the Mapusa sessions court. He said that under Section 407 CrPC, the high court has the power to order this. “We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel and also perused the contents of the two FIRs and the chargesheets,” observed a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Sonak. “On such perusal, we are satisfied with the sameness of the allegations in the two FIRs. In any case, the alleged offence forming part of the second FIR arises as a consequence of the offence alleged in the first FIR.” The court thus partly allowed the petition, and quashed the FIR registered at the Porvorim police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-2-firs-against-an-accused-hc-quashes-1/articleshow/86761938.cms||---

The Matheran police launched a search operation with the help of drones, in view of the thick forests, but the missing teenager still could not be located. The cops then took the help of the Sahayadri Range Rescue Team, which trekked the steep valley using ropes and safety gears. They searched for more than 36 hours but could not find Gupta, and called off the search. On October 2, a group of local tribals who had gone to Louisa Point in the valley for cattle grazing informed the police about a stench emanating from the area. The cops restarted the search operation by summoning the Sahayadri Range Rescue Team again. A decomposed body was found in a gorge. “As the body was fully decomposed, it was identified as that of Nishant Gupta from the clothes that he was wearing when he had left home. Also, his mobile phone was found at the spot,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teen-trekkers-body-found-7-days-after-he-went-missing/articleshow/86762936.cms||George Mendonca

---||Nagpur||40 goons to be externed in one day: CP||Nagpur: City police are gearing up for mass externment or tadipar drive targeting almost 40 goons in one day to set a benchmark by the end of this month. This year under police chief Amitesh Kumar, around 65 have been externed so far, and 52 detained under Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act. The CP said crime analytical data has been created for goons who do not qualify for prosecution under MPDA, but may be a fit case for externment or tadipar. “An exercise is underway to identify goons who can be externed from city limits. The aim is to get rid of these goons at one go from the city on the same day, engaging adequate resources and manpower,” said Kumar. He added the objective is to create a fear of the law in the minds of criminals and weaken them psychologically. Apart from the mega plan for externment, Kumar has also drawn up more anti-crime measures which he intended to implement on before the forthcoming festive season and winter assembly session in the city. On Saturday and Sunday, the city police chief supervised two back-to-back ‘all out operations’ in which he instructed all staff, from constables to senior cops, to be out in action against the goons. Around 221 hard-core criminal, mostly offenders in assaults cases and history-sheeters, were rounded up for detailed interrogation about their current activities. Around 75 absconders and wanted house-breakers too were netted during the special action. Nine cases of arms acts were also registered. “For two days, there has been a focused drive for couple of hours against goons, illegal activities and also racketeers,” said the CP. In two days, two cases related to ganja peddling too were registered. Around 76 people were slapped with preventive action under various provisions. Cops also pulled up 251 traffic violators and 43 persons were served warrants against them while another 130 were handed summons for various cases, and asked to remain present before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/40-goons-to-be-externed-in-one-day-cp/articleshow/86761927.cms||---

Anish Christoper, popular as Kevin in the skateboarding community and founder of Weskate Co, said the purpose of the workshop is to encourage more youth to take up the sport. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years and involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard and is also a recreation activity. In India, Holystoked, a skateboarding company is the pioneer of skate culture. “Apart from two sessions on skateboarding every day, the workshop also included a farm tour where participants were introduced to organic farming and other adventure sports such as slacklining and trampoline and swimming,” he told TOI. Kevin is focused on skateboarding coaching and community building including building skateparks and running programmes also for less privileged children. He is a skate camera operator in the film Skater girl released on Netflix recently and has trained skaters across India. Mahin Tandon, a national skateboarder, also assisted in conducting the workshop. Swim coach Partha Varanashi of Varanashi Farms said, seven participants as young as a 12-year-old and a 27-year-old participated. “We had Bollywood celebrity make-up artist Hiral Bhatia also attending the programme. We plan to hold seven workshops around the year. In 2018, 100 Ramps built the skatepark at Varanashi Farms and since then we have been planning to hold a workshop. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, entry to the workshop was restricted to 10,” he said “With skateboarding part of the Olympics and the film Skater Girl doing well, the demand for skateboarding has increased. The community in the coastal districts is also growing with at least 50 skaters. Skate culture is trending now. I would highly recommend that district administration build a skatepark,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/skateboarding-culture-picks-up-in-coast/articleshow/86761365.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The members of Gam Khedut Sangharsh Samiti and Prayvarana Suraksha Samiti, after visiting the site between October 1 and 3, have alleged that the land at the dumping site has sunk by almost 25 to 30 feet.In a letter to the secretary of ministry of environment, forest and climate change, chief secretary of Gujarat, CEO of Gujarat state disaster management authority and other concerned officers, the two samitis have demanded urgent investigation in the matter. “This is to bring to your notice the unfolding environmental disaster at Badi-Hoidad and neighbouring region due to illegal lignite mining and its on-going dumping activities,” the later stated. “We observed that the dumpsite has been sinking since night of October 1. We estimated that a stretch of land around 150m long to have sunk by about 25 to 30 feet,” said Rohit Prajapati of Prayavaran Suraksha Samiti who shot of the letter to the concerned authorities. “At the same time, Maleshree river that flows 350 meters away from the village has been contaminated due to the illegal mining waste flowing into it and is fast being rendered unfit for agriculture and animal husbandry needs. Also, the adjoining pastoral land too has suffered damages due to pollution,” Prajapati added. The environmentalists have also alleged that the earlier letters regarding the unfolding environmental disaster were gone unaddressed by the concerned authorities. They demand that the sinking ground phenomenon need expert assessment and immediate investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/green-warriors-warn-about-sinking-land-at-lignite-mine/articleshow/86760379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said that the state has assured that their main demand of a fee waiver for the academic time lost to Covid care will be analysed as there are technical difficulties in granting it. The doctors said they have also been assured of an ‘Academic Allowance’ for the entire pandemic period. “Renovation and construction of hostel facilities will be addressed at the earliest within a month,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Patil, president, MARD. The doctors had stopped attending to routine work and outpatient services for the past four days and were threatening to intensify the stir by stopping emergency work. The meeting on Monday was attended by Aditya Thackeray, secretaries of finance, medical education departments and Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, director of medical education and research.

---||Delhi||Pay Rs 40 lakh by October-end to homebuyer: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday asked realtor Supertech to pay Rs 40 lakh by the end of October to a homebuyer on whose complaint the national consumer panel has handed the company’s managing director a jail term. Justice Amit Bansal extended the stay on the sentence but directed that besides Rs 40 lakh, which will be used by the homebuyer, Kanwal Batra, to repay his loan, another Rs 17 lakh will have to be paid to him by November-end. The direction came after the court was informed during the hearing that the total amount due to the homebuyer was around Rs 1.79 crore, out of which Rs 50 lakh has been paid following the court’s order on September 24. Since the principal amount involved in the consumer dispute was Rs 1.07 crore, the high court asked the realtor to first clear this, following which the builder would place the payment plan before it. Advocates Shailesh Madiyal and Vrinda Kapoor, representing Batra, said the realtor must pay at least the principal amount in the near future so that Batra could repay the loan. But the court pointed out the pitfall involved. “You must be reading newspapers about how difficult it is nowadays in these matters. He (Batra) should be grateful for whatever he is getting now. Rather than seeing the glass half empty, see it as half full. The bottom line is that you get back your money,” it remarked, listing the matter for further hearing on November 11 when the realtor will submit his payment plan. The court had earlier stayed an order of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) sentencing Supertech’s MD, Mohit Arora, to three-year imprisonment. NCDRC also issued an arrest warrant against Arora for non-compliance with an earlier order in the case. Striking a balance, the high court had directed the realty firm to deposit Rs 50 lakh, out of the outstanding Rs 1.79 crore, in the homebuyer’s account within a week to show its bona fide to the court. On Monday, Supertech’s advocate, Vikas Sethi, submitted that the company proposed to pay the whole amount with Rs 10 lakh instalment every month, but the same didn’t pass muster of the bench, which said the amount had to be substantial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pay-rs-40l-by-oct-end-to-homebuyer-hc/articleshow/86761937.cms||---

Justice N Anil Kumar was considering an appeal filed by Davis Raphel of Kannur challenging a munsiff court’s decision that he has no right to interfere in the possession of property by Hendry Thomas, his father-in-law (FIL). At the high court, the son-in-law (SIL) had contended that by marrying the only daughter of the FIL, he was adopted to the family and has right of residence in the property. He also argued that he had spent money for construction of a house in the property. While declining to agree, the high court said residence of SIL in the property is only permissive in nature. Therefore, SIL cannot have any legal right to his FIL’s property and building, even if he has spent money for the construction of the building, the court held. The court also said it is shameful for the SIL to plead that he had been adopted as a member of the family, subsequent to the marriage with the FIL’s daughter. When the FIL is in possession of the property, the SIL cannot plead that he has been adopted as a member of the family subsequent to the marriage and has right in the property, the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-cant-claim-right-over-father-in-laws-property-rules-hc/articleshow/86761942.cms||---
---||Nagpur||5th person with Vidarbha link arrested in UP anti-conversion law case||Nagpur: Dheeraj Jagtap, the man from Yavatmal arrested by Uttar Pradesh ATS under the state’s religious anti-conversion act last week, had been active in Nagpur too. Jagtap, who was arrested by the ATS on Saturday from Kanpur, is the fifth person with a Vidarbha connect held in the case. The first was Vipul Mohammed — a Unani medicine practitioner with a clinic at Mominpura. He had been arrested for an alleged attempt to assassinate seer Yati Narsimhanand Saraswati, of Shiv Shakti Peeth at Ghaziabad in UP. Vipul was allegedly caught carrying a surgical knife and potentially harmful chemicals inside the temple premises. Jagtap is learnt to have been an associate of Vipul Mohammed. As TOI went around Mominpura, some of the locals could recall having seen a similar person there. TOI had a copy of Jagtap’s picture. However, no one TOI spoke to remembered having ever spoken to him. According to sleuths, Jagtap was in charge of finance and legal aid to the Maharasthra network. He was active in providing legal help to those arrested. After Vipul’s arrest, Prasad Kaware and two others were arrested from a flat in Ganespheth here. It is learnt that Jagtap and others were part of the same network, which has links with the Umar Gautam case, which had gained prominence in UP. Gautam has been accused of converting people using means which are against the law on religious conversions passed in UP last year. Sources say Gautam’s network is also spread in Maharashtra, where members are more educated than the rank and file in other states. The fund trail shows that money has come from foreign sources like UAE, Europe and also America. The outfits that funded the alleged conversion activities did not have any source of income of their own. The accused maintain that the funds came from zakat — one of the religious obligations in the form of charity in Islam. There are also excerpts of messages in which some persons have been threatened with dire consequences if they tried to revert back to their old faith, said a source. Dheeraj, Vipul and Kaware were also recent converts. They followed a typical practice of retaining their original names fully or in part. Vipul was usually known as half Hindu and half Mulsim in Mominpura, where he had checked in only a few months before his arrest. Locals said they were not aware that he was engaged in religious conversions. “We are Muslims but there is hardly any attempt to woo others to the fold, especially by using force. Even those willingly wanting to convert are given a cooling period and proper scrutiny is done to know the real motive,” said a Mominpura resident. Vipul, on the other hand, was known to be a recent convert to many, and also the first of such type. “Even before we asked, he would say that he has embraced Islam and would also offer to teach us the religious way of living,” said a youth. “None of the main stream organizations have any links with such persons. However, they have a high regard in the society and some of the religious outfits have condemned the arrest, saying that it is against the freedom to propagate a religion,” said a social activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5th-person-with-vidarbha-link-arrested-in-up-anti-conversion-law-case/articleshow/86761941.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Oncologists in Mumbai address elephant in room: Gender gap among cancer specialists||MUMBAI: Taking a leaf out of the ongoing discussions on workforce disparity in medicine in the US, the city’s cancer specialists have chosen to highlight the glaring gender disparity in oncology in India. “The proportion of women who join medical schools in India has increased from 20% in 1961 to 51% in 2015, but, like in the rest of the world, women are marginalized in leadership positions here,’’ said medical oncologist Dr Jyoti Bajpai, who is the lead author of the recently published article, ‘Gender climate in Indian oncology: national survey report’ in ‘ESMO Open’ medical journal. For instance, only one of the four major oncology societies in India has a woman president, while in two, the general secretaries are women. Her study found 70% oncology teams in the country had male managers and only 26% of the studies published by those surveyed had a female ﬁrst or corresponding author. Cancer is one of the lead causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, including in India. “By 2040, 1.3 million people are predicted to die of cancer in India, and lack of trained professionals may be one of the major reasons. Hence, optimal use of all the existing human resources by promoting gender equality in oncology departments is imperative,” said Dr Bajpai. On October 2, Tata Memorial Centre as a part of the 19th Annual Conference of Women’s Cancer Initiative invited Harvard Medical School’s Dr Julie Silver to talk about workforce disparities, especially gender gap in leadership. “It is a universal problem,” said Dr Silver, who has been at the forefront of the efforts to highlight disparity in medicine in the US.”For decades, women are not being represented on journal editorial boards.’’ The Covid pandemic, she said, had worsened the situation. She highlighted a study released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in March that found the average academic team size decreased in 2020, and women’s shares of first authorship and general representation per author group decreased in the pandemic.  The association of Indian medical oncologists has decided to work towards making their field a more gender-equal place; the Women for Oncology-India has, for starters, set up a committee that includes leading oncologists, both women and men, such as Dr S H Advani, Dr Purna Kurkure and Dr Sudeep Gupta. Dr Bajpai said the gender skew in India medicine begins right at the post-graduation level. There are only 27,951 postgraduation seats and 3,838 superspecialty training seats available for 77,428 medical graduates. “This implies that <5% are able to attain specialty training. Of these, women occupancy is only one-third,” said the article in ESMO Open. Dr Bajpai said cultural factors in India dictate women are usually responsible for caring for the family, including kids and aged members, leading to a break in career advancement. “Women face a multitude of challenges in advancement of their career. These include maternity, gender stereotype, pay gap and sociocultural prohibitions, leading to a ‘leaky pipeline’ and curtailing professional opportunities. Thus, there are fewer women role models and mentors to support and encourage junior faculty,” said the article.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/oncologists-address-elephant-in-room-gender-gap-among-cancer-specialists/articleshow/86761995.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Senior Congress leader held for duping cooperative society of Rs 85 crore||BHARUCH: A Congress leader and seven others were booked by the Bharuch police on Sunday night for defrauding a sugar cooperative society of Rs 85 crore. Congress leader Surjitsinh Mangrola, who is former chairman of Shri Ganesh Khand Udyog Sahakari Mandal Ltd (SGKUSML), was arrested by the cops on Monday. The police said that it is investigating the role of the other accused and more arrests will follow. According to the complaint filed by Pushpendrasinh Sunva, a member of SGKUSML, Mangrola committed the fraud from 2008 to 2020. Mangrola was the chairman of the co-operative society during this period. Sunva said that Mangrola misused his position to carry out financial dealings of the sugar cooperative and siphoned off the money. Sunva said in his complaint that Mangrola flouted the rules by using his private agency to buy sugar on credit from the co-operative society. Mangrola has been accused of doing such multiple dealings in the name of his agency and selling off the sugar at higher price to other agencies. Also, the accused sold off molasses to different agencies for a low price and also created fake purchase orders. The complainant said that the fraud amounted to Rs 46 crores. Sunva further said in his complaint that the accused also committed fraud in the crop loans that are given to the farmers. The complaint stated that Sunva and the other accused got the loan amount in the co-operative society’s account and the money was disbursed to nominal members who were not eligible for getting the loan. According to the complainant, the total fraud including the loan money amounts to Rs 85 crores. Sunva said in the complaint that they had approached the Valiya police in July and then filed a police application at Bharuch SP’s office in August this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sr-congress-leader-mangrola-arrested-for-duping-sugar-coop-society-of-rs-85cr/articleshow/86760418.cms||---
---||Kochi||Police seek bank a/c details of all staff at Nemom zonal office||Thiruvananthapuram: The police team probing the fund fraud at Nemom zonal office has sought bank account details of all the corporation staff employed at the zonal office in the past one year. The city corporation has started handing over the account details of the staff following the letter received from the investigation team. Unlike the fund fraud which happened in other zonal offices, the extent and manner of fraud at the Nemom zonal office was daunting for the corporation’s accounts wing primarily because they were clueless about the people who carried the money from the zonal office to the bank. An amount of Rs 26 lakh received as remittance in Nemom zonal office during 25 working days has gone missing between February 2020 and June 2021. What made it even more difficult to track the missing funds was the fact that the zonal office didn’t maintain record of the people who carried money to the bank. This was one of the key reasons why the corporation picked the cashier and the charge officer as key persons responsible for missing funds. While it is yet to be made clear whether any of these officials had colluded with the persons who swindled money of daily collection, the corporation mounted supervisory lapses on two staff and placed them under suspension. Even Mayor Arya Rajendran admitted in the news conference held here on Monday that all other staff have denied any association with the funds being received at the corporation zonal office. Informal inquiries have thrown light into the fact that random persons were picked without keeping any record to transport money. It is at this juncture that police are taking details of bank account details of all the staff employed at Nemom zonal office. The civic body’s attempts at getting the assistance of the bank to track down persons who made the deposits have not been fruitful. Police have already gathered all details of the staff employed at the zonal office. The corporation secretary has recently issued a circular to all the staff insisting that proper records of persons carrying money to the bank shall be maintained in respective offices. In the case of fraud in other zonal offices, the corporation was able to narrow down the search as it happened within a brief time period and there weren’t too many staff associated with the transport of collection sum from zonal office to the bank. The corporation had the other day filed a complaint against the cashier and charge officer of Nemom zonal office saying that they forged documents to steal the funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-seek-bank-a/c-details-of-all-staff-at-nemom-zonal-office/articleshow/86761224.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||After fire audit, 70% hospitals in district land in the risk list||Thiruvananthapuram: The fire department’s warning that hospitals have become more vulnerable to fire outbreaks following changed circumstances due to the pandemic seems to have had little impact on hospital managements. District fire department authorities have said that despite conducting two rounds of fire audits in over 100 hospitals, more than 70% of them are yet to take the necessary steps to address the safety concerns pointed out by the fire officers. Regional fire officer P Dileepan said recently the department conducted an audit at as many as 116 hospitals, including those in government and private sectors with in-patient facilities. None of them met the standards set by the department to be considered in the safe category. ''Out of the 116 hospitals, only 21 had portable fire-fighting units installed. But, even those systems were not up-to-date as the management of those hospitals had ignored the need to upgrade the fire-fighting systems on time. The rest of the hospitals did not have fire-fighting systems installed,” said Dileepan. Other shortcomings noticed include lack of proper ventilation, stocking hallways and spaces beneath stairways with combustible materials, which not only increase chances of fire outbreak, but also obstruct emergency evacuation routes. The audit conducted a few weeks ago was in fact a follow-up to another audit conducted in May this year. The regional five office has said that the district collector, who is the head of district disaster management authority, has been apprised about the sad state of affairs in the hospitals. “The fire department can only conduct the audits and give instructions to improve safety measures. The power to take legal action against those who fail to comply with the norms rests with the disaster management authority,” the officer said.According to disaster management experts, chances of fire outbreaks are more now due to the increase in the volumes of materials used in the hospitals. Almost all people carry alcohol-based hand sanitizers and hospitals stock medical oxygen in excess. Alcohol vapour and oxygen rich environments are vulnerable for a fire outbreak. There are factors such as increased electrical load on life-saving electrical equipment, compartments of beds with curtains made of combustible materials and frequent sanitation of beds and equipment, which may contribute in case of an outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/after-fire-audit-70-hospitals-in-district-land-in-the-risk-list/articleshow/86736942.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

---||Kolkata||More volunteers, giant screens to keep Durga Puja crowd moving in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The court’s order barring entry of visitors inside the pandals and restricting them at least 10m from big pandals has prompted organizers to hire more security guards and deploy more volunteers for crowd management and smooth flow of revellers during Durga Puja. Many Puja committees have also decided to set up big screens at strategic points outside the pandals where proceedings inside the pandals will be live-streamed so that people can watch them and don’t crowd near the pandals. The additional guards and volunteers will be used to manage the movement of visitors in front of the pandal where organizers are anticipating some sort of bottlenecks. Saswat Basu of Hatibagan Sarbojanin said they will be increasing the number of private security guards from 30 to 45 this year. “We will need more manpower for crowd management. Earlier, people would enter from one gate of the pandal and exit from another gate. So different flanks were used for this purpose. But this time, we will have to turn people from the same stretch, which might cause bottlenecks,” said Basu, who is also the general secretary of Forum for Durgotsab. The Puja committees have already prepared multi-layered plan for crowd management and shared with the cops. TimesViewDurga Puja organisers must make every effort to provide a Covid-safe environment as far as possible. Balancing crowds and Covid protocols may be tough but a compromise between the two is the best possible solution right now.“Last year, we observed that visitors tend to stop in front of the pandal, click pictures, have a proper look at the deity and the decorations inside. As a result, crowd waiting for their turn starts getting restless. So, we will have two-pronged strategy for crowd management. One will be to keep the people in front of the pandal moving and second would be to create enough buffer zones so that pressure of people waiting doesn’t build up,” said Swapan Mahapatra, treasurer of Ekdalia Evergreen Club, one of the biggest crowd-pullers in south Kolkata. Several smaller pujas like Young Boys Club on Tara Chand Dutt Street will also be taking help of police to manage the crowd. “We have 15 volunteers and four guards,” said Vikrant Singh of the club. Many Durga Puja committees have decided to install multiple screens at various points near the pandal so that people get a better view and they don’t flock to the pandal. “We plan to install many big screens at various points wherea 360° view of the pandal and the rituals inside will be beamed live. We will ensure that visitors get a good view on the big screen. This will also help us prevent crowding,” said Dibyendu Goswami, secretary of the club. Organizers of the Bhowanipore 75 Pally have already started making channels for the movement of visitors. “We will be deploying enough guards and volunteers to keep the movement of visitors smooth. We don’t want crowding anywhere so that social distancing guidelines are not flouted. There will also be big screens near the pandal,” said secretary Subir Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-volunteers-giant-screens-to-keep-puja-crowd-moving/articleshow/86761219.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Residents allege that there are hardly any eviction drives to retain the pedestrian space from violators, while several establishments including the corporation are utilising the platforms for advertising and business operations.Since January 2020, corporation has been renovating the damaged pedestrian platforms in the city spending Rs 69 crore under the smart cities mission. Yet, the platforms on arterial roads and commercial streets, where civil works were completed, are of no use to the pedestrians. While commercial complexes block the pedestrian space to place billboards, pedestrian platforms in Thillai Nagar, Sastri Road, Thennur High Road and Pattabiraman Road commercial streets were encroached upon at several locations. Shoppers who park their vehicles on vacant spaces were forced to walk over the right of way of the roads to the shops amid speeding two-wheelers that squeeze through the space.“Commercial establishments are occupying pedestrian platforms as there is no enforcement. Eateries are keeping their stoves over the pedestrian slabs,” H Ananth Kumar, a resident of Annamalai Nagar, said. Even Trichy Corporation was caught red-handed recently for blocking a pedestrian space just outside their main office on Bharathidasan Road with a flex banner for an official event.While there is no permission to erect banners over pedestrian platforms, the practice continues in various parts of the city. Even encroachments by shops on pedestrian space remain unchallenged. In Pattabiraman Street, two-wheelers were parked on the pedestrian space.However, corporation officials said that they will conduct an eviction drive to clear the walkways. “We will be more cautious from now on in placing the corporation’s flex banners, without disturbing the public. A drive will be conducted to remove the hindrances on pedestrian platforms,” a senior official with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/footpaths-encroached-in-trichy-city/articleshow/86762675.cms||Deepak Karthik

Systematic efforts are being launched by the accused and his friends to pressurize the victim, she said. Mayookha alleged that she had started receiving threats after she held a press conference with the rape victim. According to Mayookha, complaints were lodged with the local police, each time they received threats. But the police were unwilling to take the statements of the complainant or register cases, she alleged. Police had asked the victim to directly appear at Aloor police station to give statement when she gave complaint after receiving telephone calls threatening to finish her off, if she did not withdraw the rape complaint. Accordingly, the victim and her husband reached Aloor police station. However, they were sent back by the officials there claiming that the district police chief had asked the station authorities to record her statement only later, Mayookha alleged. She added that complaints have been given to the DGP and ADGP against the alleged support given by the police to the perpetrators of rape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rape-survivor-being-pressurised-says-olympian-mayookha/articleshow/86761987.cms||---

They said that few unidentified people have been damaging public properties including trees and watering pipes at night despite CCTV cameras keeping a watch on the road.The 800m-long walking track is frequently used by senior citizens for morning workouts. However, the recent incidents have started to worry the users. “Many of the senior citizens are devotedly taking care of the trees and maintaining the track for the past few years. Some elements are damaging the properties; we need to strengthen the surveillance,” said K Janardhanan, a morning walker. In the last few years, the flower pots, trees and pipelines have been damaged by anti-social elements. Multiple CCTV cameras are available in the vicinity at both the ends of the walking track, but recurrence of such incidents is discouraging people from utilising the facility, morning walkers said. Officials with the Trichy Corporation said that they would coordinate with the city police to improve and maintain safety at the walking track.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/walking-track-along-uyyakondan-vandalised-again/articleshow/86762683.cms||---

Cop deployment for the Puja will be finalized by October 6 on the basis of these spot visits to 18 major Pujas. The focus of Monday’s inspection — led by joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar — was on managing puja clusters. The team also looked at possible congestion points and crowd management preparedness — with both manpower and technology and public address system. The cops also checked out contingency measures adopted by Puja committees. The team spent considerable time in Behala where cops had to twice shut down the Behala Notun Dal Puja on Shashthi last year to tackle the crowd surge. “We now have two entrances: one from Behala14 number bus stand and another from Behala tram depot. We have also proposed a crowd circulation plan whereby we will team up with the organizers of Behala Friends and ensure only oneway flow towards the pandal,” said Sandipan Bandyopadhyay, one of the chief organizers. A similar arrangement has been agreed upon by the two biggest organizers in Haridevpur — Ajeyo Sanhati and 41 Pally. “We are not allowing entry into the ground. We will use the lane previously used as VIP entrance to circulate the crowd. Pandal-hoppers will come first to 41 Pally, use the exit road and reach Vivekananda Park puja and then move on to Ajeyo Sanhati. This will help us to keep the crowd flowing one way during the peak hours,” said Dipankar Chatterjee, chief co-ordinator of 41 Pally. Police are also finalizing its strategy on crowd-prevention measures, both outside the pandals and at Metro stations and bus stops. College Square has reduced its pandal size drastically. Ajoy Ghosh of Kumartuli Park said they have been granted permission to allow pandalhoppers inside a portion of the park. “There will be no mela this year. Pandal-hoppers can walk up to the spot from where the main pandal will be 10m away. The pandal has been constructed so that it is visible from a distance. The usual exit routes will be used but no advertisement boards will block the path,” said Ghosh. The police also visited Bosepukur Sitala Mandir, Ekdalia, Babubagan, Deshapriya Park, Badamtala Ashar Sangha, Suruchi Sangha, Mohd Ali Park and Santosh Mitra Square.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/last-round-check-focuses-on-citys-big-puja-clusters/articleshow/86761235.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

As the company has been directed to demolish the towers at its own cost and refund all the remaining homebuyers who had booked flats in the controversial towers, the builder in its bid to protect the structures filed an application pleading the court to modify its August 31 order. There are around 950 flats in the towers and the builder contended that demolition of just 250 flats from one side of one of the towers would remove the illegality in the project which led to the apex court's demolition order. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the company, told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna said that demolition of entire buildings would not be needed to remove illegality on the issue of maintaining minimum distance between buildings and encroachment of green area as held by the court. He said that if one of the towers is sliced from a side then that area could be used for a garden and the minimum statutory distance between towers would also be complied with. The company's plea was stiffly opposed by senior advocate Jayant Bhushan, who on behalf of Resident Welfare Association, contended that Supertech was trying to seek review of the apex court order in the guise of filing modification application which cannot be allowed. He told the bench that there were many other violations of laws and norms by Supertech in addition to breach of minimum distance and encroachment of green area and pleaded the court not to allow the plea of the company. He also cited various judgements of the apex court by which such an attempt by parties to review its verdict in the guise of modification application was rejected. The court after hearing both the sides rejected the plea of Supertech for modification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-rejects-petition-to-modify-order-on-razing-twin-towers/articleshow/86762012.cms||---

The students will be selected through a draw of lots. Headmaster of the Panchayat Union Primary School (PUPS) in K Paramathi village, R Selvakannan, who has announced the initiative, said that this would help prevent students from dropping out after school and also encourage vaccination. The teachers will be funding the expenses towards tuition fees for enrolment into government colleges such as medical, engineering, agriculture and veterinary institutes. The school, which has 210 students enrolled between classes I to V has six teachers, including the headmaster. For the past few weeks, the school has been serving as a vaccination centre. With a section of people around the village not vaccinated yet, the management announced that parents of school-going children in adjoining villages, who get vaccinated between October 1 and 17 can participate in a lucky draw. To enter the draw, a vaccination certificate must be provided as proof. “On October 20, we will select three parents in our school campus in the presence of the local body and parent-teacher association members. An agreement will be signed immediately to assure funding the tuition fee of one child each of the three selected parents,” Selvakannan told TOI. Even if some of the teachers are transferred during the course of time, the headmaster said that he will pool money to sustain the children’s education. The contest applies only to support the tuition fee of three students. All the parents who participate in the contest will be given stationery items as compensatory prizes since schools are to open from the next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/take-the-jab-well-fund-your-kids-higher-edu-karur-school-to-parents/articleshow/86762680.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Surat||BJP MLA raise issues of bad roads on social media||Surat: After facing criticism over conditions of city roads by commuters, BJP’s MLA from Varachha and former minister, Kishore alias Kumar Kanani, also went online to raise the issue. Kanani posted a letter written by him to the city municipal commissioner on Monday raising concerns about the condition of roads in limits of Varachha Zone of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). Kanani also criticised municipal councillors from AAP in his letter posted on Facebook page.The BJP MLA demanded immediate repair of the roads damaged due to rain. He claimed that all roads in Varachha were damaged and people were facing problems. “People are worried due to the condition of the roads. But SMC’s Varachha zone officials and elected municipal councillors are not serious about this. No one is interested in repairing the roads,” he stated in the letter. “They (SMC workers and municipal councillors) are interested in illegal constructions but not aware about where the roads are damaged or where the potholes are,” he alleged. Indirectly, Kanani alleged that the officials and municipal councillors are more interested in identifying illegal construction projects. Kanani had recently posted a letter on his Facebook highlighting the issue of traffic police penalising those carrying textile bales on motorcycles. He had also threatened to launch a campaign against traffic police if the actions are not discontinued. Varachha A zone chief D M Jariwala was not available for his comments despite several attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bjp-mla-raise-issues-of-bad-roads-on-social-media/articleshow/86760444.cms||---
---||Kochi||Corp to seek separate accounts for zonal offices||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation would raise a special request with the state government to operate separate accounts for zonal offices instead of a centralized account, said mayor Arya Rajendran here on Monday. Referring to the irregularities in fund management in zonal offices, she said that a request would be forwarded to the government. The corporation officials have earlier said that technical deficiencies in IKM accounting software and laxity during Covid lockdown months provided a conducive environment for fraud. “One issue with the present software is that daily collection records at zonal offices cannot be monitored centrally. It will take 15 days to reflect. While it is possible to track a particular transaction for a day in a zonal office, it is still a herculean task to cross check it with the bank statement as records from 11 zonal offices come as bulk documents,” officials have pointed out. Regarding the ongoing protest by BJP, she said that it was too irrelevant that sometimes she and her peers don’t even realize a protest was going on. She said that she called for a mediation meeting based on humanitarian grounds. “All the things which they demand are already in practice. Still I called for a mediation considering the health of some of the councillors. If they have some good solutions to suggest, we are ready to accommodate it,” said mayor. Taking a dig at the BJP’s allegations that tax payers’ money has been stolen, she said that the corporation keeps records of all the payment. “I want to allay the concerns of the public. There is no reason to worry. Corporation has records of payments in offices” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-to-seek-separate-accounts-for-zonal-offices/articleshow/86761249.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Fee regulator lens on Ahmednagar college trust’s 10-year accounts over ‘expenses’||MUMBAI: Debunking the explanation given by an Ahmednagar college trust for allegedly “forging” its expenses, the state’s Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) has initiated an in-depth inquiry into its balance sheets since 2011-12. TOI had earlier reported that at least 19 employees held two or more posts in colleges run by the same Ahmednagar trust, Gramin Samajsevi Sanstha. Discrepancies, including showing a peon and a nursing college housekeeper as a lecturer and a department head in their pharmacy college, respectively, came to light while scrutinising a fee hike proposal submitted to the FRA. Their salaries were shown as the institute’s expenses to seek fee revision. While the trust had earlier told TOI that it was an inadvertent mistake in feeding data during the pandemic due to limited staff, the fee authority has reportedly found the trust used the same modus operandi in 2018-19 too. The regulatory body has initiated an inquiry into the fee hike proposals submitted during almost a decade. The trust runs four colleges in Ahmednagar—three for nursing and one for pharmacy. In a recent order, the authority noted, “It is of the view that the explanation put forth (by the institute) is patently false and nothing but an attempt to anyhow overcome the illegality committed... The record reveals that the same modus operandi was followed even in 2018-19.” It further observed, “Such practice is being followed for a long time to get higher fees approved and then to claim reimbursement from the state government cannot be ruled out.” The authority, therefore, ruled that it is necessary to conduct an in-depth inquiry to uncover the truth. The trust was directed to submit all records of income and expenditure from 2011-12, including the fee revision proposals submitted, the audited financial statements and bank statements. In his submission to the FRA, Prakash Kolpe, president of the trust, said transactions relating to the institution were made in cash as it is located in a small village, where there is no nationalised or scheduled bank. He said he was not aware of the FRA norms and the procedure of maintaining account books and submitting online fee proposals. Kolpe further said there was a shortage of qualified staff and he has used government funds for developing the institute, also invested his personal earnings and even secured a loan for the purpose. He added he did not use any money for personal gains. Advocate Dharam Mishra, an FRA member, said the order in this matter will be passed on October 8. “It will be in the best interest of all stakeholders. This order should set a precedent for other colleges in the state that indulge in such manipulation to get fee proposals approved and to get scholarship reimbursements from the government. There should be more accountability on their part,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fee-regulator-lens-on-trusts-10-yr-a/cs-for-forging-college-expenses/articleshow/86762029.cms||Yogita Rao

The elections to Puducherry local bodies are scheduled in three phases on October 21, 25 and 28. Recording the submissions, the court directed the state election commission to keep in abeyance the process of receiving nomination papers for the election till a decision is made by the chief minister. “It is best that the anomalies be addressed first and be removed before the process is undertaken afresh,” the judges said. They then adjourned the hearing to October 5 for the authorities to report the decision of the CM. The issue pertains to two pleas moved by Puducherry MLS J Pregash Kumar and N Periannan alleging irregularities in reserving seats for SCs, women and BCs. According to the petitioners, as per the Puducherry Municipalities Act and Rules, reservation of seats for SCs shall be made primarily by taking note of the population of the community. On August 23, the state election commission notified such reservations for the forthcoming local body election. As per the notification, wards 22 (Colas Nagar) and 28 (Ozhandal Keerapalayam) have been reserved for SCs/women. Wards 24 (Viduthalai Nagar), and 33 (Kombakkam) had been reserved for the SCs, the petitioner said. He alleged that the wards reserved for SCs and women were not in consonance with the population ratio as per the census of 2011. As per the census report, ward no 23 (Nethaji Nagar) has 29.04% of SC population which is the highest followed by ward no 17 (Nelithope) 28.41%, ward no 6 (Thiruvalluvar Nagar) 27.71%, and ward no 13 (Pudupalayam) 25.26%, the petitioner said. Similar anomalies were also pointed out in reserving seats for backward communities also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/pondy-civic-poll-put-off-to-rectify-quota-issues-centre/articleshow/86762035.cms||Suresh Kumar

Months after experts from the Old Goa-based ICAR - Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI) and Goa University developed a prototype for the drone-like device that hovers around coconut palms to pluck its nuts, scientists of the institute have taken a step forward to build the gadget. They have proposed the idea to the central government and are hoping that their request for funds is fulfilled, after which, they intend to launch the device within a couple of years. TOI had reported about the innovation in June. “There is 1.2 million hectares of land under coconut cultivation in India for which there are only 10 lakh padelis (coconut harvesters) in the country. We require sufficient funds to materialise the Fly Cocobot and have requested the government of India to fund us for the same,” director of ICAR-CCARI Parveen Kumar said. He added that they will work with the Goa University and experts from engineering colleges in the state to build the device. “Within two to three years, the working model of the Fly Cocobot can be launched. Soon after that, coconut harvesting will be drone-based,” Kumar said. The device is that it flies to the top of the palm, gets attached to the trunk with grabbing arms, cutting arm then opens up for cutting the desired bunch decided through video displayed on screen of the remote module. The machine is conceptualised to have operational efficiency of 12-15 palms per hour. The drone-based device can be remotely controlled for safe harvesting of coconuts. The prototype design could be even employed for harvesting in other palms like arecanut, palmyra palm, oil palm and date palm as well worldwide, besides its probable modification for other farm operations like spraying and pruning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fly-cocobot-prototype-may-become-a-reality-soon/articleshow/86762055.cms||Nida Sayed

Police have also insisted on creating police booths at the entry and exit points and also an outpost to increase vigil. Since National Highway 210 (Trichy-Pudukottai-Ramanathapuram) passes close to the Trichy international airport runway, alternative solutions – either to build underpass or reducing the height of the road - was discussed at the aerodrome committee meeting held here on Monday. City commissioner of police G Karthikeyan, who is also the chairman of the aerodrome committee, presided over the meeting where airport director S Dharmaraj and senior officials from the various departments from the airport including CISF participated. As per the decision taken at the last aerodrome committee meeting held three months back, 16 new surveillance cameras were installed around the airport to monitor and prevent illegal activities, airport officials said. The cameras would be a helpful in identifying people who are involved in smuggling from outside the airport. The cameras cover the city-side and outer areas of the airport. Police authorities stressed the need to create awareness among the general public as the airport area was a protected one and no one should be allowed to operate drones within a 3km radius. Acquisition of land in Ambedkar Nagar, which has been a hindrance to the runway expansion and providing a suitable alternative place for the people who will have forgo their houses was also discussed at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/police-to-increase-vigil-verify-residents-near-trichy-airport/articleshow/86762690.cms||---

On the other hand, the opposition decided on Sunday to mount more pressure on the LDF and Mayor Arya Rajendran by fielding all BJP local body representatives in the district across panchayats and municipalities for a protest march to the corporation office on Monday. Meanwhile, the LDF has also kick-started ward level campaigns to dispel allegations of corruption being levelled by the BJP councillors. The LDF led ruling council hopes to resolve the crisis without causing further administrative hassles. “There is no opposition in the ruling council as per municipality act. We want to resolve this peacefully and hence we have called for an all-party meeting,’’ said D R Anil, LDF parliamentary party leader. While the BJP councillors who in earlier years had welcomed mediation attempts however, have toughened their stand this time as part of a strategy to portray the LDF leadership as something fraught with corruption. The BJP has been calling for a battery of special councils on a slew of issues and even when none of the demands raised in the council was ever accepted by the council, the opposition believe that they have been able to pitch themselves as crusaders against corruption. Two more special councils are lined up this week - one on plastic waste management and control and another on asset management and revenue income. The special council on revenue income is being convened for the second time as a glitch from the BJP in drafting the letter for special council proved costly for them as LDF councillors pounced on them and demanded that there should be clarity in topics to be discussed in special councils. Official sources said that what unravelled in the council meeting on September 29 was an orchestrated after effect of the persistent campaign of the BJP to fling allegations of corruption on the corporation council. While the initial focus has been on cornering the mayor, she stood up to the BJP councillors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/all-party-meeting-today-to-end-corp-deadlock/articleshow/86737120.cms||---

The MMRDA has been given the mandate to maintain both the Eastern Express Higway and the Western Express Highway since some stretches on the two arterial highways are witnessing Metro-related construction works. Metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivas said, “We will carry out concretization of one lane close to the median on Eastern Express Highway. Gradually, second lane will also be taken and the remainder lanes will not be touched as utilities are passing beneath the surface.” Asked whether concretisation will be taken up on the Western Express Highway as well, Srinivas said that as of now there is only a plan to eliminate the potholes on it by using asphalt. An MMRDA official said, “Western Express Highway is the most busiest stretch and it would not be prudent to block the lanes for road concretisation work as it can lead to total traffic chaos.” The MMRDA official added that concrete roads, unlike asphalt ones, are more durable and less prone to damages as they can withstand higher load emanating from lakhs of trucks and buses using the stretch. The 26km Western Express Highway stretches from Dahisar toll naka to Kalanagar junction in Bandra, while the 23.5km Eastern Express Highway is from Mulund toll naka to Sion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-lane-of-eeh-to-be-concretised-for-a-smooth-ride/articleshow/86762972.cms||Manthank Mehta

In a demi-official letter dated October 1 to the CMs of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, West Bengal and Goa, Stalin said, “We need to put up a united effort to restore the primacy of state governments in administering the education sector, as envisaged in our Constitution. I look forward to your cooperation in this crucial issue.” Stalin enclosed the report of the Justice A K Rajan committee on the detrimental impact of NEET on rural students seeking admissions to medical colleges. Based on the recommendations, the Tamil Nadu assembly recently passed a law banning NEET for admissions to state medical colleges. The law is pending presidential approval. “Our considered position has always been that the move by the Union government to introduce NEET goes against the spirit of federalism and violates the constitutional balance of power by curbing the rights of the state governments to decide on the method of admission in the medical institutions founded, established and run by them. In this regard, we consider that the state governments need to assert their constitutional right and position in deciding the method of admission to their higher educational institutions,” Stalin said in his letter. “I request you to kindly go through the documents and extend your support in this regard to ensure that the students of our respective states, especially those from rural areas and marginalised sections of the society, are not put to hardship in obtaining admission to higher educational institutions,” he said. Stalin said he had instructed a team of DMK MPs to directly hand over the translation of the Justice Rajan committee report to the state governments and seek their support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-drums-up-support-for-anti-neet-law-writes-to-12-cms/articleshow/86762066.cms||A Ragu Raman

Some Station House Officers (SHO) of his range had even written to Union home minister Amit Shah informing him about the officer’s constant demands. In their complaint, the SHOs alleged that the joint commissioner would harass them by sending show-cause notices. “He extorts money from us each month through a man and often forces SHOs to meet him. If we refuse, then he says his wife is an IAS officer with contacts till the top level,” stated the complaint. “First, he calls us on WhatsApp and then asks the SHOs to meet him in person. His man meets SHOs at different locations to ask for money. Since the SHOs are scared, they end up giving the money. The joint commissioner is also getting an independent house constructed in Noida and keeps asking SHOs to send raw materials,” added the complaint. The complainants further stated that after a complaint was filed against him, the joint commissioner stopped asking the SHOs for favours. However, he later started making his SO do this work. “Now the SO calls and asks us for things. We had complained earlier too, but because of his and his wife’s contacts, he was shielded and nothing happened to him.

After returning home, the girl narrated the incident to her parents who rushed to the school with other villagers. An angry mob manhandled the principal Tumde and shut him after calling the cops. A team of Ballarpur police rushed to the spot and arrested the principal. Later, block education officer Varsha Pipre and SDPO Raja Pawar visited the school and took details about the incident. Offence has been registered against the principal under relevant sections of IPC and POCSO Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-principal-arrested-for-molesting-std-v-girl/articleshow/86761254.cms||Mazhar Ali

Now the government has appointed Dr DD Bant from KIMS, Hubballi, again on temporary basis. This has triggered Koppal doctors and activists to question why a doctor from Hubballi should be at the helm of the institute and not a doctor from Koppal itself. Koppal MP Sanganna Karadi has also objected to the appointment of Dr Bant. With these developments, the appointment of a director for KIMS, Koppal has become an issue for the government. Karadi told TOI that he has written two-three letters to the medical education minister objecting the appointment of Dr Bant. “There were many complaints against Dr Bant during his tenure as the director of KIMS, Hubballi. He had also worked as a director at KIMS, Koppal in the past and his service was not up to the mark. The district administration had also complained about his performance. KIMS, Koppal has many eligible doctors for the director’s post and the government should consider them in the interest of the organisation” he added. Gururaj Desai, a social activist in Koppal, said the medical education minister should consider the issue very seriously. “If the government continues with its decision, it may affect the healthcare services of the region,” he said. Meanwhile, sources in KIMS, Koppal said a group of doctors has also approached the medical education minister demanding the appointment of a doctor from KIMS, Koppal itself. “In a letter, they have said that eligible doctors from same organisations are being appointed as directors at other institutions but only KIMS, Koppal, is getting directors from other organisations,” said sources. When contacted, Dr DD Bant said the government has issued a group order but he has not yet been issued the individual order. “I don’t want to respond to one’s statements but will surely obey the order issued by the government,” he added. Medical education minister Sudhakar was unavailable for comment and did not respond to messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/koppal-kims-docs-unhappy-with-outsider-director/articleshow/86760469.cms||---

They also presented a memorandum addressed to the President of India through the DC, Mohali. The memorandum was received by the additional deputy commissioner Komal Mittal. Farmers also demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation for the victims and a government job for the kin of the deceased. They also tried to scale the main gate of the administrative complex. Hundreds of farmers led by Mehar Singh Theri, state vice-president Bharti Kisan Union, Sidhupur along with Narinder Singh Kang, Nachhater Baidwan, Kirpal Singh Seou, Paramjit Singh Kahlon, Harwinder Nambardar, Minder Sohana, Aman Poonia, Gurpreet Singh Niamian, Karamjit Nambardar Moly, Rajinder Singh Dhola Qadian Union, Jaspal Singh Landran and Jaswant Singh Punia and others laid siege of the administrative complex for over two hours. Farmers blocked the road opposite the DC office for hours. Traffic was diverted to the other side of the complex and Mohali traffic police had a tough time managing visitors at the complex. Addressing protesting farmers, Mehar Singh Theri, state vice-president Bharti Kisan Union, Sidhupur said the manner in which the son of a Union minister killed farmers by driving his car over them and opening fire at them indicates a conspiracy by the Uttar Pradesh and Union governments. Farm Leader Parminder Singh Sohana said that a memorandum had been submitted by the farmers’ organisations to President Ram Nath Kovind saying that the country was outraged over the brutal killing of farmers in broad daylight on October 3 in Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh). They said that Union minister of state for home affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra's son Monu and his accomplices carried out the murderous attack. In the letter, they demanded sacking of the minister for inciting violence and communal hatred, besides murder of farmers. They also demanded immediate arrest in the case and said that the case should be investigated by a SIT under the supervision of the Supreme Court. The protesters said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar should also be removed from his post for inciting violence while holding a constitutional post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lakhimpur-kheri-farmers-gherao-dc-office-try-to-scale-admn-office/articleshow/86761258.cms||---

The court asked Muley to cooperate with the ED investigation and deposit his passport with the agency. The court summoned Khadse and his wife Mandakini to appear before it on Thursday, after taking cognizance of the ED chargesheet. Muley’s lawyer Mohan Tekavde said, “He was not directly involved and not a beneficiary in the money laundering case. He is cooperating to the investigation and considering these facts the court granted him bail.” On April 28, 2016, Mandakini and her son-in-law Girish Chaudhari entered into a sale deed for a MIDC plot in Pune. They paid Rs 3.75 crore to ancestors of the original owner of the plot and Khadse’s kin spent Rs 1.37 crore for registration and stamp duty. The stamp duty was paid on Rs 22.83 crore, which was the actual government price of the land in the record, to avoid legal issues. Sub-registrar Ravindra Muley had allegedly helped Khadse’s kin to manipulate government records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dy-registrar-muley-gets-bail-in-khadse-land-deal-case/articleshow/86762074.cms||Vijay V Singh

Six people have allegedly died and more than 150 people have been hospitalised in the last month. Now, there are four active cases among which two have been admitted at KIMS Hubballi and one each in at SS Hospital, Davanagere and the Gadag district hospital. They are all stable. Gastroenteritis broke out in Makarabbi village in Huvina Hadagali taluk recently. The village has about 2,000 people from 450 families. According to preliminary investigation by the district health officer of Ballari, the patients were suffering from gastroenteritis, uneasiness, vomiting and diarrhoea after drinking contaminated water. According to sources, Jal Jeevan Mission water supply pipeline work had started in the village, but it was halted due to some technical problems. It is said that the regular drinking water pipeline was damaged due to the JJM work and dirty water was getting mixed with the clean water at a particular spot. The village has also five borewells, but the health department has certified that water from these borewells is unfit for drinking. “We have stopped the drinking water supply from other sources, now we are supplying drinking water through four tankers to the villagers,” said PDO Sharanappa B. The villagers have alleged that the local gram panchayat supplied contaminated water even when it was unfit for drinking and held it the local body responsible for all the six deaths in the village. “The gram panchayat has been supplying contaminated water for the last one month. More than 150 people have been hospitalised and six have died. Who is responsible for this incident?” said Ningappa, from Makarabbi. DHO Dr LH Janardhan said, “I visited the village on October 2 and advised officials to supply drinking water through RO plant. While one person died in August first week due to this reason, five villagers have died in the last 10 days. The last case was reported on August 28 and our staff started taking preventive action by distributing ORS pouches and examining residents who are still at home.” Quote Will visit village soon: DC According to our officials, four people have died after consuming contaminated water at Makarabbi village. I will look into the matter and also visit the spot within a couple of days and initiate action.

Till a few days ago, the area was infested with snakes which crawled out of piles of waste dumps. Now, a lovely garden has sprung up here, complete with benches and fountain. It is one of the places which underwent a transformation as part of the initiative under the smart city Thiruvanathapuram limited (SCTL) to mark the 75th anniversary of Independence. The Friends Park at Nemom was built four years ago and was maintained by a group of people under the title “Friends”. There are 30 members in the group. They associated with SCTL to install lights, tiles and fountains in the park. There is a pond connected to the park that is used for fish farming. The profits from the farming will be utilised to maintain the park and will also be donated to those in need, said Rajeev, one of the members of the Friends group. Kinavoor was another place where a pond was cleaned in nine days and the adjacent land has been converted into a mini park. The pond was in a bad state due to lack of maintenance and disposal of market waste. The place was overgrown with shrubs with huge grasses grown all over the pond. First, the grass was removed using an earth mover. Later 12 benches and six solar bulbs were installed. A park featuring swings and a see-saw is being built on the property. There are also plans to build an open stage in the compound, which will serve as a medical check-up centre in the future. “We have also planned to come up with entertainment activities for the people. The park will be named as “E K Nayanar Park. We are also planning to do fish farming in the pond,” said Sura Kumari, ward councillor. According to SCTL officials, the initiative is to transform an unorganised or underutilised public area in each ward of Thiruvananthapuram into a lively, clutter-free active environment. The transformation is a low-cost endeavour completed in less than 75 hours with minimum interventions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sctl-initiative-creates-new-green-spaces/articleshow/86737181.cms||---

DSP Prashant Koushik said the crowd tried to enter the collectorate even after the police advised them to submit a memorandum to allow a delegation. However, some agitators climbed the gate after jumping over barricades which resulted in a scuffle. Farmers opened the gate and entered collectorate and police resorted to lathi-charge, he said.

---||Mumbai||Take Nashik IG’s help to map tribal belts, Bombay HC to govt||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday asked the state government to take the help of Chhering Dorje, Inspector General (Nashik range), for mapping tribal areas where deaths due to malnutrition are reported. “We will appoint Dr Dorje to visit the villages and submit a report on what is to be done,’’ said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a clutch of PILs. Earlier, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the HC that officers made a two-day tour of Melghat and its health facilities, and prepared two reports. The judges noted that the officials had visited only primary health centres, and did not go into the villages. “The photographs on record have nothing to do with the tribal population. What is the ground reality in the villages?’’ asked Justice Kulkarni. The judges said they want data in respect of every area so that there can be effective monitoring. “For the purpose of mapping, going to the villages is absolutely necessary,” said the CJ. Justice Kulkarni added, “What we want is details from every area. Otherwise, this would lead nowhere… The prime concern is how we can prevent the deaths.” It was then that the CJ referred to Dorje. “Why don’t you associate Dr Dorje? He is a police officer plus a doctor. He has done wonderful work in prisons. Dr Dorje would be going as our (HC’s) officer. He is from a different (northeast) state with a domination of tribal population,’’ said the Chief Justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-take-nashik-igs-help-to-map-tribal-belts-hc-to-govt/articleshow/86762990.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Schools in Mumbai start day 1 with 35-45% attendance||MUMBAI: Attendance for class 8-12 in many schools in Mumbai ranged 35-45% on day one, and managements were confident that turnout would gradually improve. Officials said reopening in Mumbai is likely to pick up in coming weeks. Lack of parental consent and the online exam schedule have delayed the process, said an official. At Borivli’s Don Bosco school, 141 of 541 students attended physical classes. Principal Flovi Dsouza said efforts are on to instill confidence in parents. But at others like Gopi Birla Memorial in Walkeshwar, parents have not consented to in-person learning. Principal Veena Shrivastava said they will continue with online teaching for the time being. In Mumbai, civic schools had over 45% attendance. Urban areas of Thane district had 40% while rural areas saw 54% students attending. Junior colleges in Mumbai could barely reopen on Monday as class 11 and 12 students, who are below 18, are not vaccinated and hence not allowed to commute by train to their colleges. In all, there are 1,772 aided and unaided schools and junior colleges in Mumbai and 4.46 lakh students between classes 8-12. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a virtual address to teachers and students, urged them to strictly follow SOPs so that schools don’t have to shut again. Unveiling the ‘My Student, My Responsibility’ campaign, he asked teachers to shoulder the responsibility of keeping students and themselves safe. Dr Suhas Prabhu, chief of the paediatric task force of the state, said this was “the right time” to reopen schools. Education officials and politicians also visited schools and issued appeals urging parents to send children for in-person, offline learning. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar visited his alma mater Saraswati High School and conducted a Marathi class for class 10 students. “Physical schools are a must…students have suffered immense learning loss,” said Sushil Singh, supervisor of Swami Vivekanand School, Chembur. The school conducted offline classes in batches from 7.15 am to 6.15 pm for students of 8, 9 and 10. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad who visited a few institutions said a blended approach to education is needed in these difficult times. Teachers, she said, should watch for psychological effects of school closure on students. Schools have now chalked out online and offline timetables. Abhishek Kulkarni of Laxmibai school, Mulund said they have implemented the hybrid teaching method. The school had around 32% attendance.

The chairman said the board was an autonomous body and Meena had put the credibility of state education at stake to gain political mileage. He said there was no paper leak during REET as the question papers were sent to the district committees on September 23 and district collectors were monitoring the movement. Jaroli said the BJP MP’s claims of the REET answer key being leaked were false as no such document existed. He said the original copy of answers for the question papers were kept safe with the board. Jaroli also said, "People of the state trust the education board and it is a professional body which regularly conducts board exams and tests like NTSE and STSE and REET, which can help unemployed youths get jobs." Jaroli said senior BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria was his old friend who knew his professional proficiency. The education board chief said even BJP leader Rajpal Singh Shekhawat knew him well, but Meena had some vested interests behind his false claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/edu-board-chief-refutes-exam-paper-leak-rumours/articleshow/86762070.cms||---

Gehlot would be hosting lunch at the CM residence in honour of Channi. Gehlot’s cabinet colleagues and Congress state leaders have been invited for it. Channi is scheduled to reach Jaipur by air at 11:15am and return around 2:15pm on Tuesday. Rajasthan’s revenue minister and Congress observer in Punjab Harish Chaudhary could accompany Channi. As per the programme released by the Rajasthan CM’s officer on special duty, Gehlot would receive Channi at the residence at 12pm and it would be followed by lunch. A cabinet meeting is scheduled at 5pm and a council of ministers’ meeting is scheduled at 5:15pm the same day. Confirming the programme, Rajasthan Congress president and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra told TOI, “Around 300 Congressmen, which includes all MLAs, PCC office-bearers, heads of party’s frontal organisations, former union ministers and party candidates of last assembly and general elections, have been invited to the lunch in honour of the Punjab CM.” Dotasra, however, declined to comment on the purpose of Channi’s sudden visit. Gehlot played an active role in Punjab politics when he headed the Congress screening committee during the last Punjab elections in 2017. It is likely that Channi and Gehlot discuss Congress strategies for the upcoming Punjab elections. During the political upheaval in Punjab that saw a change of guard in the neighbouring state last month, Gehlot welcomed Channi’s appointment as CM and advised Capt Amarinder Singh to refrain from going against the Congress. In reaction, Singh hit out against Gehlot and reminded him to focus on Rajasthan that was caught up in similar turmoil considering Sachin Pilot’s opposition to Gehlot. Channi’s meeting with Gehlot assumes significance in that light. By supporting Channi, Gehlot sent across the message that he would always stand by the Congress high command’s decisions. Sharing irrigation water from the Indira Gandhi canal has remained a contentious issue between Punjab and Rajasthan. It may figure between the meeting of the two CMs, as farmers in Sriganganagar district are up in arms against the Gehlot-government for the past three days. Dumping of human bodies in the canal in Punjab and Haryana is another issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-channi-to-meet-today/articleshow/86762086.cms||---

He alleged that the unlawful detention of opposition leaders is against democratic values.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab deputy chief minister S S Randhawa were among those prevented from going to the state by the BJP-led UP government, Gehlot said, a day after violence during farmers’ protest there claimed eight lives, including four farmers.“Only a dictator government can do this. Does the ruling BJP in UP want to end democracy? In this way, the violation of civil rights is also against the spirit of the Constitution,” he said.“I strongly condemn the detention of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi ji and other leaders by the Uttar Pradesh police. She is a prominent opposition leader and was on her way to meet the families of farmers who were killed yesterday in Lakhimpur Kheri district... The unlawful detention of opposition leaders is against democratic values,” Gehlot wrote in a tweet on Monday.Priyanka Gandhi’s convoy was briefly stopped by Uttar Pradesh police in Lucknow where she reached Sunday night, a few hours after violence during the anti-farm laws protest. “Priyanka ji was going to stand with the families who lost their loved ones in yesterday’s (Sunday) violence. It is totally unfair to stop them from discharging duty,” Gehlot said.An FIR has been registered against Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra and several others in connection with the violence. Farmer leaders claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the cars that allegedly knocked down some protesters opposing Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit.Gehlot said that the BJP government’s inhuman face has come to the fore. It is undemocratic to ignore the farmers’ demands, stalling their movement, oppressing them and then not allowing any opposition party to stand with them, he said.Meanwhile, the Congress workers staged protest in many districts across the state including Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unlawful-detention-of-opposition-leaders-anti-democratic-gehlot/articleshow/86762092.cms||---

Congress workers said that the incident had left the country shocked and horrified at the “state shelter given by the state and Centre to the criminals.”” In their memorandum, they also demanded immediate suspension of the ministers. Former deputy CM Chander Mohan said that murder of eight persons in Lakhimpur Kheri showed that democracy had been done away with in the country. “We demand strict action against the accused involved in the crime,” said Chander Mohan. Congress party members also accused BJP workers of maintaining silence on the issue. “The government has failed to serve residents of the country and the way peacefully protesting farmers have been killed clearly shows that the government does not care about lives of people,” they said.

Customers at fuel stations do complain about high prices as their budgets have been badly affected over the past six months,” said an Ahmedabad-based petroleum dealer. The continual increase in fuel prices is worrying industry and transporters. “Fuel costs account for a major chunk of our operating costs and we cannot overcharge clients on pre-negotiated contracts and are forced to absorb the higher prices. Diesel prices have been rising every two-three days and these increments are also making it difficult for us to negotiate contract prices with clients,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA). Meanwhile, industry players are also worried about the added cost pressures due to higher fuel prices. “While industrial activity has picked up pace, higher fuel prices are an added cost pressure affecting margins of manufacturers. All our domestic and export shipments will get more expensive. Raw material prices have already increased on account of global cues,” said Bhupendra Patel, former president of Vatva Industries’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/petrol-price-in-city-on-brink-of-rs-100/articleshow/86793320.cms||Niyati Parikh

Moving into hybrid mode with large batches - around 120 students in each class - may not be feasible at this stage, said principals. A few re-opened on Monday, but for science practicals; others plan to add numbers gradually. Travelling without vaccination is a problem for students, and in some cases, even teachers. First-year junior college (FYJC) classes will continue online for the time being.  Around 150 HSC students reported for science practicals at St Andrews College on Monday. "They are being allowed with consent letters from parents. We will gradually increase numbers. Unlike junior colleges attached to schools, which have 30-40 students per class, we have around 120 students in each of the 14 divisions," said principal Marie Fernandes. The college will allow students to log in for lectures, if they are unable to come to class.  St Xavier's called FYJC students on Monday for document submission and to get acquainted with the campus. “Most teachers took online lectures from the campus today. Once our non-teaching staff are relieved from election duty, we will start science practicals," said principal Rajendra Shinde. Junior college vice-principal, Hasnain Naqvi, said the state should provide clarity on train travel for students from far-off suburbs, he said.  Vice-chancellor of HSNC University and Principal, KC College, Hemlata Bagla, said while the college plans to continue FYJC classes online, it will call in HSC students in phases, starting with practicals. "Our outstation students will not be able to join as hostels are yet to start, but we are trying to make use of mobile computer panels to live stream practicals.," said Bagla.  Nagindas Khandwala College, Malad, will also start with science practicals some time this week, said principal Ancy Jose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fyjc-batch-may-not-come-to-class-soon-except-for-pracs/articleshow/86762102.cms||Yogita Rao

According to sources, “the Governor is studying the bill following objections raised by not only the opposition but by activists and constitutional bodies.” The BJP MLAs had petitioned the governor against the bill, which they claimed would promote child marriages. The BJP had alleged that child marriage would be encouraged if this bill became a law. The bill provides for compulsory registration of marriages including underage marriages, which is rampant in the state. A delegation of BJP MLAs had also complained to the governor in the past while Congress-backed Independent MLA Sanyam Lodha had also raised his voice against this bill during debate in the assembly. Due to the controversy, it is believed that the Raj Bhavan has not taken it forward so far and wants to be satisfied about it first. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights also objected to this amendment. Governor Kalraj Mishra has not given his comment on this bill pending in Raj Bhavan. However, the government had announced that registration of marriage not make it legal and the amendment was brought in on the directions of the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mishra-studying-marriage-registration-bill/articleshow/86762103.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Roused economic activity, high prices lift Gujarat’s GST mop-up||AHMEDABAD: As industrial production has returned to full-throttle after the second wave of Covid cases with a massive increase in raw material prices across sectors, GST collection in Gujarat grew by 28% in September 2021 against the same month in 2020. Total GST collection in the state stood at Rs 7,780 crore in September, up from Rs 6,090 crore in September 2020, according to data from the Union finance ministry. Experts say the increased tax collection is primarily due to a revival in demand and the low-base of last year, as tax collection was relatively low due to the post-lockdown effect. J P Gupta, state commercial tax commissioner, said, “Demand has shown revival over the past couple of months and due to this, economic and commercial activity has picked up. Industrial production has improved to meet growing demand for goods and therefore tax collection numbers are up.” “In the run up to the festive season, we anticipate a further surge in tax collection backed by greater demand. Moreover, e-way bill generation increased by 5% from August, which indicates greater movement of goods,” Gupta added. Of the total collection, State GST (SGST) in Gujarat stood at Rs 3,654 crore this September, up 47.5% from Rs 2,415 crore last September. Tax collection, however, grew marginally, by 3.5%, against August’s figure of Rs 3,530 crore, according to figures from the state commercial tax department. Industry players attributed the increase in collection not to demand revival alone but also to the increased prices of raw materials and essential commodities. Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) said “Domestic activity has shown great improvement over the past 45-60 days. The prices of all essential commodities have increased over the past year with steel and plastic prices doubling and cement, chemicals and other raw materials witnessing a 50% increase in prices. This has had an impact on prices of finished goods and may also have fuelled the increased collection of taxes.” Industry estimates suggest that apparel and automobiles, have clearly seen a spike in prices. “Demand for these products is growing ahead of the festive season. Overall, business for restaurants and the entertainment industry also increased, due to which a rebound is expected,” said Patwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/roused-economic-activity-high-prices-lift-states-gst-mop-up/articleshow/86793298.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt set on restoring OBC quota but yet to grant Rs 435 crore for survey||MUMBAI: A month after saying it would direct the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC) to collect empirical data on OBCs as soon as possible in order to restore their political reservation in local bodies, the state is yet to release funds of Rs 435 crore for the survey. The state said the delay is because of a difference of opinion on data collection method. While the MSBCC wants to conduct a full caste census, the government feels random sampling and use of secondary data will suffice. “We have asked the commission secretary to request the MSBCC to consider the request and get back to us,” said a senior official. Another key issue is the ability to define the “political backwardness” of OBCs. Designing a questionnaire for this is more difficult than one which is used to establish the economic backwardness of a community. In March, the SC had struck down the 27% OBC quota for local body polls on the grounds that the combined quota of SC, ST and OBCs could not exceed the 50% cap. The SC asked for empirical data on OBCs in each local body to allow for a restoration of the quota within the 50% cap. The state faces local body elections for six zilla parishads and their panchayat samitis on October 6. The state government decided to issue an ordinance to provide for the OBC quota in rural local body polls by amending the state’s gram panchayat law. The quota had been quashed by the SC in March. The ordinance allows for OBC quota in rural bodies with the rider that once combined with the SC and ST reservations, the combined quota will not cross the 50% limit. Also, the OBC quota will not cross 27% of the seats, in keeping with the existing state legislation. However, the State Election Commission said the ordinance would not apply to the upcoming zilla parishad polls. The quota issue is important because the powerful Maratha community and the OBCs are caught in a struggle for dominance in the state and political parties do not want to risk alienating either group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-set-on-restoring-obc-quota-but-yet-to-grant-rs-435cr-for-survey/articleshow/86763004.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Governor Kalraj Mishra said this while addressing the online meeting of the members of the advisory committee of the Governor’s Relief Fund. There was a suggestion to include the donations given to the relief fund in the CSR activities of corporates. Expressing gratitude to all the Bhamashahs who gave financial support to the fund, Mishra said there has been an increase in the collection of funds in the last two years. In the year 2020-21, Rs 54 lakh were collected in this fund, which increased to Rs 1,85,000 in 2021-22 by the month of September. Mishra said that based on the suggestions of the members of the committee, a letter has been written to the central government to bring donations to the fund under the category of 100 percent tax exemption instead of 50 percent tax exemption now. He said that work is also being done to simplify the process of donating by digitising the relief fund. For this, software is being developed to deposit the donation amount online in the bank account of the fund. When this happens, the online donation receipt will be automatically generated by the system on a real time basis to the donor. The governor called upon all the members to cooperate with their contacts in collecting maximum funds through the migrant Rajasthanis settled in the country and abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/guvs-fund-can-now-be-used-for-flood-famine-relief-too/articleshow/86762109.cms||---

The complainant Shyam Trivedi (23), a third year BCom student, told police that he came in contact with one of the accused Deepak alias Dilip Bhatt through a friend in August 2019. His friend had told Trivedi that Bhatt would help him get a contractual job in the postal department. When Trivedi met Bhatt, he was told that he would help him get a permanent job and not a contractual one, but he would have to shell out Rs 5 lakh. After Trivedi’s father agreed, he paid Bhatt Rs 2.5 lakh. The accused told the complainant to pay the remaining amount once he gets his posting. A few months later, Bhatt sent Trivedi his appointment order on WhatsApp and took Rs 2 lakh from him. Later, Bhatt made the other accused Abdul Kadir Sheikh speak with the complainant to convince him that his job was final. As Trivedi trusted them he paid the remaining Rs 50,000. However, the physical copy of the appointment order never arrived. When Trivedi investigated on his own, he found another victim from Porbandar. Bhatt had also conned Dilip Santhara by promising job to his son. Recently, when Trivedi realized that he had been cheated, he approached police and lodged a complaint on Sunday at Junagadh A Division police station. Police said that Trivedi also mentioned about the accused cheating 24 others. “The accused had shown appointment orders of 24 other people on his phone to the complainant,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lured-by-job-in-postal-dept-college-student-conned-of-rs-5l/articleshow/86760553.cms||---

The case has been registered based on a complaint by the revenue inspector of Nemom zonal office. As per the complaint, the two employees forged documents to siphon off corporation funds received as building permit, licence fee, professional tax and other types of income. The complaint pointed out that the staff acted with an intention to cheat and to steal the funds of the corporation. An amount of Rs 26 lakh received as remittance for various purposes went missing in 25 working days within a year at Nemom zonal office; the inquiry by the corporation’s accounts wing had revealed. The amount remitted at the zonal office from February 2020-June 2021, never got reflected in the corporation’s bank accounts. While the complaint blames officials for forging documents, the corporation has not found any evidence to associate both the employees with forgery. The audit also reported that the corporation did not have any system to keep a record on the carriers who transported money from the corporation to the banks. With the corporation being unable to find the actual persons who may have failed to deposit the money, the onus is being placed on the cashier and superintendent who reportedly failed to check the counter foils and maintain the register. An inquiry at 11 zonal offices had revealed financial frauds in Attipra, Ulloor and Nemom zonal offices. Nemom reported the biggest fraud so far with an amount of Rs 26 lakh missing from the corporation’s accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/forgery-complaints-against-cashier-superintendent/articleshow/86737331.cms||---

As the coal reserves at 15 thermal stations in those states may last for just two to three days, Singareni Collieries Company Limited has decided to produce more coal by fixing targets. However, Telangana Genco officials claimed that they have sufficient reserves for the next one week to 10 days. Telangana generates 3,700 MW of thermal power to meets its requirement. Since the cost of imported coal has gone up by 100%, thermal power stations, sponge iron and cement industries were looking at local coal and the coal ministry is reviewing coal stocks on a day-to-day basis and requesting SCCL to increase coal production and transportation. SCCL chairman and managing director N Sridhar on Monday held a meeting with directors and general managers on on coal production. “Thermal power stations in Telangana, which have agreements with Singareni, have one week to 10 day coal stocks,” Sridhar said. Since rains have abated in October, at least 1.9 lakh tonnes of production and transport must be done daily. All area general managers should completely concentrate on transport and production, he said. Meanwhile, SCCL said it has achieved a turnover of Rs 11,920 crore in the first six months of the current financial year by recording a growth of 67% compared to the last financial year. He said last year during the first six months, coal sales were only Rs 5,573 crore, but this financial year they went up to Rs 10,071 crore, registering a growth of 81% and an increase of Rs 4,499 crore over last year’s sales. “SCCL could achieve the highest sales during the first half of this financial year due to large-scale preventive measures taken up by the company,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sccl-to-hike-coal-output-tocash-in-on-shortage-in-states/articleshow/86761303.cms||Koride Mahesh

On September 28, Arbaz Mullah's body was discovered on a railway track in Khanapur, with body parts strewn about. Later, the railway police registered a murder case and began probe. The case has now been transferred to district police for further investigation. The investigation has been intensified by a special team led by a DySP-level officer. The youth was said to be in love with a girl of a different religion. The railway police had booked father of the girl, and two leaders of right wing organisation identified as Maharaj and Birji.Lateef Khan Pathan, district president of AIMIM, stated that they will wait until Thursday for the police to arrest the accused, and that if they did not, a protest rally will be held in Khanapur. It was originally planned to invite Owaisi to the rally, but due to his busy schedule, he will pay a separate visit to the victim's family. However, the date is yet to be finalised, they said. Anjuman-A-Islam Minority Welfare Foundation protested in front of the tahsildar's office on Monday, demanding justice for the youth's family. Riyaz Ahmad Patel, the organization's president, stated that police should act fast to arrest those involved in the murder.According to police sources, the investigation team has identified some suspects and is working to determine where and when the murder took place. On the day of the incident, Arbaz's cellphone was in the city limits until 6:25 pm, and then it was in Khanapur until around 7:15 pm. Police are trying to ascertain what happened during this 50-minute period. According to the sources, police are also investigating the possibility of the girl's father hiring men to murder the youth. The girl's father had not approved of her love for Arbaz because he belonged to a different community and had sternly warned her not to see him. However, t he girl had refused to listen to her father. According to the sources, money to the tune of RS 90,000 is also missing. Arbaz had got the cash by selling his car in the used car market.

The order was given on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by environmentalist Rajendra Tiwari. Assistant conservator of forests Ghanzansar Ali Zaidi said, “The six-member NGT banned all commercial activities in the reserve forest. Any course of action will be decided after we receive the NGT order.” The petitioner said that the NGT had reprimanded the archaeological department and Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) for commercial activities in the sanctuary. “Both the departments have been ordered by the NGT to immediately stop these activities and get the fort vacated,” he said. In the PIL, listed on January 18 this year, the petitioner had alleged that commercial activities were going on in the forest area, including serving liquor and construction of parking lot, at the fort. The fort belongs to the archaeology department and commercial activities are being run by the RTDC. The NGT took cognizance of increase in movement of people and night tourism activities in the area. “In 1961, the Nahargarh forest was declared as a reserve area, on the basis of which the forest department was given the right of control it,” Tiwari said. In August, NGT had appointed a high-level committee to probe into the matter. The committee included Jaipur district collector, chief wildlife warden of the forest department, and members of the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board (RPCB). The committee was directed to verify the claims made in the petition and present a report. “Tourists coming to Nahargarh were violating forest norms and entering the reserve forest after sunset and before sunrise. Moreover, trees were also chopped without permission to develop a parking space. These issues were highlighted in the report,” sources in the forest department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ngt-bans-bizactivities-atnahargarh-fort/articleshow/86762129.cms||---

The order was issued taking the increase in deaths during the second wave into consideration. “The company which was authorised earlier was not found fit due to service dissatisfaction. We have asked authorities to blacklist the company and start the process of purchase again,” said a faculty in GMCH 32. The walk-in mortuary chamber was approved and the process was initiated in May by the UT health department. The chamber was to have managed around 25 bodies at a time. GMCH asked for the mortuary chamber as only two chambers out of five are functional and the hospital had to keep bodies of Covid deceseased in an air-conditioned hall. “Covid bodies cannot be kept along the non Covid bodies. Therefore, a dedicated mortuary for Covid cases is required. In case we need to do an autopsy for research etc, it is not possible unless there are separate and sufficient chambers,” said a faculty. Sources said that the walk-in mortuary chamber should be operational by next month. “PGI has no dedicated chamber for Covid bodies. Many deaths took place during the second wave. Therefore, at least there should be a mortuary in the city hospital which is only for Covid patients,” said a doctor in GMCH 32. Previously when tendering was started using government e-marketplace (GeM), no vendor approached. The college then took to short notice tender to avoid wastage of time. “However, the vendor who got approval, gave us equipment which was substandard. When we asked him for services, he did not turn up. That is why we would want to blacklist him and re-start the process of buying the chamber,” said a faculty in GMCH. 8 Covid cases reported in Tricity, 1 diesSix Covid cases were reported in Chandigarh while two patients were discharged. The total recovery count is 64,386 and confirmed cases number 652,43 including 819 deaths. There are 38 active cases. One Covid patient died in Mohali and one person tested positive, said deputy commissioner Isha Kalia, adding that six patients had recovered. The active case count fell to 28 from 34 the previous day while recovery rate increased to 98.42%. Health officials said that the sole case surfaced from Mohali urban. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said that the number of positive cases is reducing in the district. “This does not mean that people must get careless and start roaming around in a crowd without reason. People must not slacken on wearing mask and maintaining social distancing. Precautions are yet to be taken lest the pandemic strike back,” she said. Health officials said as of now, 68,747 cases have been reported in the district of which 67,651 persons have recovered and 28 cases are active. A total of 1,068 persons have died. In Panchkula, one fresh case of Covid was reported on Monday. No death was reported.

---||Mumbai||Will fix pits on Mumbai-Nashik highway by October 20: Centre to Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Pothole repair work on the Mumbai-Nashik highway will be completed by October 20, the central government told the Bombay high court on Monday. “Unless there is very heavy rainfall, we’ll try to complete it by October 20,” additional solicitor general Anil Singh told a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. On September 24, the HC had referred to news reports on the potholes on the highway and fatal accidents. The court told the state and central governments to resolve the pothole issue so that lives are not lost. The judges had pointed out that the Mumbai-Nashik highway is a part of the old Mumbai-Agra highway and hence the National Highway Authority, a central agency, should also look into the problem. Singh said work is in progress on the 24-km stretch from Thane to Vadape. “It will be completed by tomorrow (Tuesday) unless there is heavy rainfall,” he said, informing that three teams are working on it. He added that for the 97km stretch from Vadape to Nashik, work will be completed by October 15. There are seven teams on this stretch. “The 3-4km, where there is heavy damage, will be completed by October 20,” said Singh. He assured that NHAI will get the work completed by October 20 with a caution about the heavy rains. The judges posted the hearing on October 25. “Come back and let us know,” said the CJ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-to-hc-will-fix-pits-on-mum-nashik-hway-by-oct-20-in-mumbai/articleshow/86763027.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Rajkot||On his birthday, ex-sarpanch gifts SSY accounts to 149 girls||Palanpur: People usually distribute sweets, chocolates, cut cakes, light lamps, offer prayers or at the most throw lavish parties to celebrate their birthdays. But residents of Mehsana’s remote village — Bhandu — will remember the way former sarpanch Gopi Patel celebrated his birthday. On Monday, Patel ensured that future of 149 girls gets secured. Patel got bank accounts of these girls opened under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) for which he contributed Rs 250 each as first instalment. The initial target was to open account for 500 girls and on Monday parents of 149 took benefit of Patel’s initiative. “As many as 149 SSY accounts for girls have been opened today,” confirmed by RA Goswami, superintendent of post offices, Mehsana. SSY, a savings scheme promoted by Government of India (GOI), can be opened by parent of a girl child who is below ten years of age. The scheme’s tenure is of 21 years or until the girl gets married after the age of 18 years. It is part of GOI’s ‘Beti bachao, beti padhao’ campaign. “I have made the first contribution of Rs 250 for 149 girls,” Patel told TOI. Patel said his effort is to educate parents so that financial future of their daughters gets secured in initial stages of their lives. The former sarpanch called post office staff at his office on Monday. The village has a population of 12,000. SSY requires that at least one contribution is made in a financial year until the girl child attains maturity. “I want to create this awareness so that society shows more interest in bringing up a girl child in a meaningful way,” he said, adding that parents who are willing to contribute more can also do so by adding their contribution in the first instalment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/on-his-birthday-ex-sarpanch-gifts-ssy-accounts-to-149-girls/articleshow/86760579.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Cutting red tape, online push helps Delhi climb ease of business ladder||NEW DELHI: All permits needed for building construction cleared in less than 60 days, electricity connection simplified, dedicated commercial courts and online facility for registration of partnership firms. Initiatives like these of Delhi government, aimed at easing the regulatory compliance burden, have resulted in the city improving its ranking under the State Business Reform Action Plan from 23 in 2017-18 to 12 in 2019. The state government identified 596 government-to-business and government-to-citizen services for simplification and 454 have already been streamlined. These include property mutation, trade licensing and renewal. A government official added, “For getting an electricity connection in Delhi, the number of procedures has gone down from three to two. The process of mutation in utility records is now integrated with the registration process, allowing intimation of mutation as soon as the deed is registered. An integrated portal gives real-time access to updated data and integrates all land and property-related records of ownership and encumbrances.” A senior official said that as reduction in regulatory compliance burden on businesses and citizens has the potential to become the new driver of economic growth, the Delhi government has reduced 454 burdensome compliances related to over 30 departments to boost ease of living as well as ease of doing business. Of the 454 simplified and digitised compliances 72 related to New Delhi Municipal Council, 155 to the three municipal corporations, 22 to the labour department, 24 to the transport department, 17 to Delhi state pollution control body, 16 to Delhi Jal Board, and nine to the revenue department. A government official said that the improvement in the business environment in the capital, being one of India’s key commercial centres, played an important role in helping India leapfrog to the 63rd place in the World Bank's Doing Business ranking in 2020 from 142nd five years ago. Delhi hopes that the business reforms being undertaken will further improve its ranking. “For 2020, the State Reforms Action Plan comprises 301 action points spread across 15 reform areas and a new dimension to the reform agenda. Delhi has submitted evidence for 204 reform points,” an official disclosed. The official said, “Minimising the regulatory compliance burden is an initiative to address and enhance minimum government and maximum governance. As the process of reducing the compliances has fruitfully been executed, several departments have either reduced, eliminated, modified or introduced reforms to provide a hassle-free experience to businesses and citizens.” The government is focusing on digitising the compliance systems to make the processes transparent, robust, and convenient for the users and easily accessible with defined timelines. Despite numerous reforms, however, some traders are facing a few problems. “The new GST registration is available online, but due to an exercise launched by Delhi government to identify bogus dealers, it has become difficult to obtain new GST registration in Delhi,” pointed out chartered accountant Rakesh Gupta. “There are objections about documents and propriety of papers. The government should also simplify this process.” Niranjan Poddar, president, Automotive and General Traders’ Welfare Association of Mori Gate, said business in the national capital would expand further if Delhi government focused on infrastructure development in the markets. “The government should coordinate with different agencies to ensure better structural amenities for the markets such as parking facilities. This will give a bigger push to business growth,” said Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cutting-red-tape-online-push-helps-city-climb-ease-of-business-ladder/articleshow/86761311.cms||AlokKNMishra

The police identified the accused as Deepa, 40, of Andoorkonam. She was working as the assistant branch head of the Kilimanoor branch of a private finance firm. Police said the alleged fraud was revealed following an audit conducted at the branch by senior officials of the firm. They found out that she had allegedly committed frauds through different methods. One of them was to misappropriate the payments made by people who had availed gold loans from the firm. When someone completed the payment and took back the gold ornaments they had pawned, she would not close the loan in the register. Instead, she would replace the gold ornaments that were returned with rolled gold and siphon the cash paid by the customer. It was also found out that she made pecuniary benefits by availing gold loans using identity documents submitted by the firm’s customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-held-for-duping-financial-firm/articleshow/86737377.cms||---

On Sunday night, a thunderstorm hit Ranchi which blew away the makeshift tents that they had built at the protest site. Many of them remained standing with their belongings while the women cops, who were protesting with their children, were in an even worse situation. Frustrated by the situation, the policemen started shouting slogans in the middle of the night asking the government to fulfil their demands. One Ajay Mandal said: “Strong wind and rainfall have blown away our tents and drenched our belongings more than once during the ongoing agitation. Unfortunately the state government has not paid any attention to our demands yet.” The cops were faced with a shortage of food and drinking water. The administration had provided one water tanker at the venue but it is inadequate to meet their requirements. On Monday, state BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash and Ranchi MLA C P Singh visited the protest site and expressed solidarity with their agitation. Prakash said, “You are staging a peaceful and disciplined agitation over your demands. The state government should take immediate decisions for regularization of services. The BJP would raise your demand at various forums.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rough-weather-increases-suffering-of-agitating-policemen/articleshow/86761809.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Villagers block road in protest against abduction of local activist in Godda||Dumka: Thousands of villagers belonging to the tribal communities blocked the Boarijore-Lalmatiya road in Godda district on Monday in protest against the alleged kidnapping of a local anti-displacement activist identified as Ravilal Hembrom (30). The blockade was launched soon after the news of his alleged abduction surfaced at 7 on Monday morning. Hembrom, a resident of Bherenda village, is known for mobilising local residents against the proposed expansion of Lalmatiya-based Rajmahal coal project of the Eastern Coalfield Limited (ECL). Mahagama SDPO Shiv Shankar Tiwari said, “Attempts are on to find Ravilal and a probe is on to ascertain the facts about the incident.” Sources said unidentified persons had earlier abducted Shivnandan Murmu of Bherenda village along with one Ramesh Kisku on Sunday night but later released them. Talking to reporters, Shivnandan Murmu said the kidnappers were five in number and travelling in an SUV with a number plate bearing Lok Janshakti Party on it. “They first took me and Kisku at gunpoint to Boarijore and headed to Barhet (Sahebganj) around 11pm. The kidnappers then handed Kisku to another group of armed men in Barhet and took me back to Boarijore. They asked me to call Ravilal Hembrom near a petrol pump after which they picked him up.” Shivnandan claimed that the abductors were against Ravilal’s move to protest against the ECL's proposed expansion plan. He also maintained that one out of five was called Sonot Marandi of Babupur village. Due to the protest and road blockade, hundreds of trucks and passenger vehicles remained stranded in the area since morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/villagers-block-road-in-protest-against-abduction-of-local-activist-in-godda/articleshow/86761749.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||Ranchi||Farmers’ death: Cong slams UP CM, JMM questions Modi, Shah silence||Ranchi: The violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday followed by detentions and arrests of leaders from the opposition, who were on their way to meet families of the victims, triggered widespread anger and protests in Jharkhand on Monday. In a tweet, chief minister Hemant Soren said, “The heinous incident in #Lakhimpur yesterday is a blot on humanity & a blatant display of majoritarian cruelty by the Ruling Party in UP & at Centre. I strongly condemn their undemocratic attempts to detain all Opposition leaders from meeting the bereaved families of the victims.” Meanwhile, Ruling Congress, other organisations and the Left parties burnt effigies of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP leaders in different parts of the state. JMM, which is leading the alliance government, condemned the violence and questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on the issue. In Ranchi, the city unit of Congress led by state party president, Rajesh Thakur, organised protests at Albert Ekka Chowk and burnt an effigy of Yogi. Thakur said, “Sunday’s incident is an attempt by the BJP government to trample the protests of farmers against the black agriculture laws of the Narendra Modi government. The Yogi government is completely rattled by the farmers’ protest and has crossed all limits of lawlessness. We also protest against the arrest of our leader Priyanka Gandhi, who was on her way to meet the victims’ families. Both farmers and Congress will fight against this BJP government tooth and nail.” Congress spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan dubbed the incident as “murder of democracy”. He said, “In BJP raj, democracy is being killed every day,” he said. Left parties, too, burnt effigies of Yogi and Union minister of state for home, Ajay Mishra Teni. Notably, Teni and his son, Ashish, are accused of triggering violence. The protesters demanded the removal of Teni from the Modi cabinet with immediate effect and the arrest of the culprits. CPI leader Ajay Singh said, “Hearing of the case must be done under the supervision of the Supreme Court and outside UP.” JMM also lashed out at Modi and Yogi. “Union minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Mishra Teni, is not being removed from his post because BJP wants to bank on the votes of the Brahmin community in the upcoming UP assembly election,” the party’s central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya claimed. Bhattacharya also criticized the UP chief minister for not allowing the representatives of opposition parties into Lakhimpur Kheri. “While the UP CM has not uttered a word about the issue, Mishra has termed the protesting farmers as terrorists,” he said. JMM had pledged allegiance to the ongoing protests of the farmers against the Centre’s controversial farm laws. “We have sided with the farmer bodies and supported their bandh calls and took part in it. JMM stands firm in support of their demands and will continue to support them,” Bhattacharya added. Violence broke Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday following the death of four farmers after they were rammed by a car allegedly belonging to Teni. His son was said to be driving one of the cars. Both, however, denied the allegations even as the UP police have reportedly booked the minister’s son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/farmers-death-cong-slams-up-cm-jmm-questions-modi-shah-silence/articleshow/86761698.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Lift ban on bhog distribution or we will breach it: Puja samitis||Jamshedpur: Barely a few days ahead of the Durga Puja, which will start with the Navratra on Thursday, organisers in Jamshedpur (East Singhbhum) have locked horns with the state government over distribution of bhog. The organisers said the government should withdraw the ban on bhog preparation and distribution at pandals or they would break the rule. While the state government’s puja guidelines have banned community fair or distribution of bhog at pandals to curb gatherings in the wake of Covid-19, over 150 puja organisers demand rollback of the clause citing “religious sentiments”. State disaster management minister Banna Gupta, however, defended the government’s move. Bhog is a meal prepared as devotional offering to the deities. However, health minister Banna Gupta took to Twitter appealing to maintain caution. He said, “Puja organisers must know that the government has not banned home delivery of bhog. Hence, there is no point in protesting against it. We all must gear up for the festivities.” Manwhile, Abhay Singh, convener of Thakur Pyara Singh Dhurandhar Singh Durga Puja Samiti, Kashidih in Sakchi, said, “Banning the preparation and distribution of bhog at the puja pandal is like messing with the religious faith. We oppose this particular rule of the government.” Singh said 170 puja samitis attended a meeting over this issue on Sunday. “The government should call off the ban on bhog distribution at pandals or else the puja samitis will be compelled to breach the notification,” he said. Jairam Youth Sporting Club convener Arvind Singh said the government's guidelines are confusing. “Puja without rituals and customs is not done. Offering bhog to the goddess and distribution of the same among the devotees is part of the rituals,” Arvind said. Convener of the Harijan Basti Durga Puja Samiti, Sitaramdera Hari Mukhi said puja samitis have volunteered to organise the rituals in compliance with the guidelines but the ban on bhog is one issue that is not acceptable. Sidhgora Durga Puja Samiti convener Chandragupt Singh also said the government should be sympathetic to the feelings of the puja organisers on the matter. General secretary of the Kendriya Durga Puja Samiti, Ram Babu Singh, said in 2020, puja samitis organised festivities in total compliance with the guidelines and will do the same this year. “However, the ban on bhog distribution is controversial. The government should address the issue at the earliest,” Ram Babu said. There are 360 plus Durga Puja samitis in the two adjoining industrial towns of Jamshedpur and Adityapur.

This project is a small step towards achieving its mammoth target of installing 1,995 MW solar power by 2022, set by Niti Aayog. Jharkhand has been lagging behind in meeting its Renewable Power Obligation (RPO) all these years. Installation work of the canal-top solar power project being constructed over Sikidiri canal under Ranchi district, 20 km from the state headquarters, is supposed to begin this month and once completed, it would be made operational by January 2022. Talking to TOI, Project Director, Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency, Bijay Kumar Sinha said that Kolkata-based Vikram Solar is executing the project. “We have collected data from the irrigation department about available canal length in the state, which is around 1,600 km and after completion of the first project our, idea is to cover as much canal space possible,” he said. The state government has been focusing on canal-top solar power projects to solve the crisis of land for installation of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. Land for installing solar panels is a big challenge in terms of cost and its availability as well. Sinha said that for the 2 MW project, around 750 mts of the canal would be covered using PV panels. “There is always the possibility of augmenting the capacity further by increasing the cover of solar panels,” he said. Power from the solar installation would be evacuated at 33kV voltage level to the grid. While the first canal-top solar plant was commissioned in Mehsana district of Gujarat in 2012, the idea of utilising the space over canals got support of the ministry of new and renewable energy as it helped avoid unnecessary delay in land acquisition for the purpose of setting up solar plants. With support of MNRE since 2014, seven states have already installed around 66 MW canal-top solar plants. JREDA had floated the tender in this regard in February 2019 but in absence of response from eligible parties, the tender was re-issued with a deadline in September 2019 at a slightly reduced project cost. After completion of formalities, Vikram Solar was finally selected for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) with the responsibility of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) for a period of 10 years. JREDA is going to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) for selling the power to the grid, once production starts by January next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/states-first-canal-top-solar-power-plant-to-become-operational-by-jan-2022/articleshow/86761718.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Thousands of litres of water, including Gangajal that are offered by devotees here often flows into the drains. Deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri on Monday said that they are now working to put it to right use. “I have directed the officials concerned to come up with a detailed plan to store the sacred neer in Mansarovar (nearby pond) and sell it to the devotees by properly purifying and packaging it,” Deoghar deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri said after visiting the shrine on Monday. Bhajantri said the flowing the sacred water into the drain also hurts religious sentiment. “Utilising the sacred neer by filtering and recycling it will not only satisfy the religious sentiment of devotees but also provide them the opportunity to purchase it as prasad,” he added. He said directions were also given for utilising different puja paraphernalia particularly belvapatra and flowers for making agarbattis to create job opportunities for locals here. The Deoghar district administration is already working for a GI tag for its pedas, a traditional sweet offered to the deity, as naivedyam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/deoghar-mulls-repackaging-of-sacred-water-for-sale-as-prasad/articleshow/86761767.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Eight councillors of the 15-member civic body, including Kolvenkar, have served a notice of no-trust motion against Dhavlikar. Shantinagar ward councillor Archana Dangui, who had signed the notice against Kolvenkar, played a key role in the move. Dangui has now joined hands with the Kolvenkar team to bring down Dhavlikar, who has been in office for a year. BJP-led Ponda Nagrik Samiti had rewarded Dhavlikar with the post of PMC deputy chairperson on October 21, last year. Dhavlikar joined the BJP-backed Ponda Nagrik Samiti on October 2 after defecting from MGP’s Rising Ponda panel. He was instrumental in ousting councillor Amina Naik from the post of deputy by an 8-4 vote margin on October 13, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-no-trust-motion-against-pmc-deputy/articleshow/86762203.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

The files, unveiled by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), pose a big challenge for Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had knocked out his arch-political rival, former PM Nawaz Sharif, through a Supreme Court order in the "Panama Papers" case that had barred Sharif from holding public office in future. The latest papers have named Khan’s cabinet members and financial backers, politicians, retired generals, media owners and businessmen as possessing secret offshore financial assets. As Khan had vowed that stern action would be taken against Pakistanis if found involved in a scam, his first big test would be to decide on finance minister Shaukat Tarin, minister for water resources Chaudhry Moonis Elahi and his predecessor Faisal Vawda, National Bank of Pakistan president Arif Usmani, the PM’s ambassador at large for foreign investment Ali Jehangir Siddiqui, the managing director of the national investment trust, Adnan Afridi, and others whose names were unearthed by the leaked papers. The names of several retired Pakistani generals and their children have also figured in the "Pandora Papers". According to the leaked files, ex-President Pervez Musharraf’s military secretary, Lt Gen Shafatullah Shah, owns an expensive apartment in London through an offshore company that is in the names of his wife and son. Former ISI director-general (counter-terrorism) Maj Gen Nusrat Naeem (Retd) got a company registered soon after his retirement in 2009.

They also demanded relaxation in the moisture content of paddy. After a high voltage drama for an hour on NH-44, the administration managed to convince the protesting farmer to lift the blockade. However, due to the blockade, commuters had to face inconvenience. The paddy procurement had been officially started by the Haryana government from October 3, but there was no relief as a large number of farmers were not able to sell their produce on the second consecutive day. On Monday morning, farmers even locked the main entrance of Karnal new grain market. Similar protests were held at Assandh, Nilokheri and Indri grain markets. Protesting farmers alleged that on the one hand, the government claims to start the paddy procurement, but on the other, the government agencies had failed to procure even 5,000 quintal of paddy in two days in the district. Manjeet Singh, a protesting farmer, said he came to the grain market with paddy five days ago, but his crop had not been procured so far. Sources said only 4,210 quintal of paddy has been procured till Sunday against around 5 lakh quintal of arrival in the district. Sources said rice millers are not supporting the procurement process and have not started the lifting of paddy from the grain markets of Haryana over their demands. That is the major reason behind the delay of the procurement process. An official on condition of anonymity said it will take two or three days more to streamline the procurement process. Deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “We have talked to the rice millers and they have agreed to join the procurement with deductions as per the moisture content. The rice millers were objecting to the new norms in procurement but an assurance has been given to them that the issue will be resolved in the next two days. We will ensure procurement of a large quantity of paddy by Monday night .” Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, Karnal district president of BKU (Charuni), claimed, “The administration has given assurance of smooth procurement and allowed us to bring the produce without schedule system as well. Besides, the rice millers have also assured us to procure paddy up to 22% of moisture content.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-block-highway-over-slow-paddy-procurement/articleshow/86762315.cms||JK Singh

While talking to the media persons here on Monday, parallel acting jathedar of Akal Takht, Dhian Singh Mand said the Sikh high priests had summoned Amarinder to give a clarification on sending his cabinet ministers and MLAs for lifting the Bargari Insaf Morcha. Mand, who had led the Bargari Insaf Morcha, had said he lifted the morcha on December 9, 2018, after then CM Amarinder Singh had sent his ministers and MLAs to assure them of fulfilling all their demands. “Unfortunately our demands were not met,” he said. Besides Amarinder, Randhawa and Tript, other Congress leaders summoned by the acting parallel jathedar included Harminder Singh Gill Kulbir Singh Zira and Kushaldeep Singh Kikki Dhillon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/jathedars-summon-amarinder/articleshow/86762348.cms||---
---||Business||Srei may move HC; says no defaults||Kolkata: Srei may move to the high court appealing against the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to supersede its board and appointment of administrator in both the group companies — Srei Equipment Finance and Srei Infrastructure. Srei chairman Hemant Kanoria spoke to TOI after the RBI announcement on Monday and said that it has no default nor it has received any communications from banks on any defaults. Srei had submitted a proposal to pay the full amount to banks under a scheme filed under Section 230 of the Companies Act 2013 in October 2020, said Kanoria. “However, they have neither accepted the scheme nor proposed a payment schedule acceptable to them.” He argued that non-bankinf finance companies (NBFC) and their customers witnessed acute financial difficulties due to the overall state of the economy as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the country. In order to provide respite from the debt servicing burden, RBI directed all lending institutions, including Srei, to offer nine-month moratoriums and recast debts of MSMEs and infrastructure players. However, no such respite was provided for NBFCs, and they suffered cash flow mismatch as realisation/collection from borrowers declined. Kanoria pointed out that banks have been controlling the company’s cash flow since November 2020. “Almost Rs 3000 crore has been collected by them, out of which they have been disbursing to themselves. Over the last three decades, Srei has already paid Rs 30,000 crore as interest and another Rs 20,000 crore principal to banks,” he added. Kanoria claimed that there has never been any delay in loan servicing by Srei in the past before Covid-19 ravaged the country. He also added that as banks had control over the company’s cash flow, it could not pay any other creditors. Therefore, the Company had to file separate schemes for other creditors, besides banks, in December 2020 to make payments to all in a structured manner. “We are also surprised because the NCLT order for all creditors is still in process. There is also an order for “no coercive measures” by the creditors and/or regulators. We will take all necessary steps as advised by our lawyers in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/srei-may-move-hc-says-no-defaults/articleshow/86761606.cms||---

The MLA alleged that he was manhandled by the protesters but did not lodge any police complaint. Gupta had reached the rest house for a meeting with party workers to discuss the strategy for Ellenabad byelection. However, as he reached the rest house, he was informed by the rest house employees that the main hall was already booked by farmers for holding a meeting. On seeing the MLA, a group of farmers gheraoed him in the lobby and did not allow him to leave. The drama continued for about half an hour, before police reached the spot to rescue the MLA. Interacting with mediapersons at his home later, the MLA said he was unaware of the farmers meeting at the venue and alleged that he was manhandled and someone even tore his shirt while trying to push him to the main hall of the rest house. He said the behaviour was unbecoming of farmers but he was not going to lodge any police complaint. Ranbir Singh, a farmer leader on the other hand alleged that the MLA had intentionally reached the rest house while they were holding a meeting. “I suspect a conspiracy to provoke the farmers,” he said. Farmers raised slogans in protest but none manhandled the MLA, he said. Hisar DIG Balwan Singh Rana went to meet the BJP MLA at his residence. A police spokesperson said that so far the police had not received any complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-take-bjp-mla-hostage-in-hisar-rest-house/articleshow/86762361.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s pollution plan: Jams to be eased, cracker ban stays||NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced the Delhi winter action plan against air pollution, listing 10 points where the government will be focusing on this winter. The chief minister said while the use of bio-decomposer spray developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) to prevent stubble burning would continue this year, the government will work to ease traffic flows on 64 highly congested roads where jams are a problem. In addition, the chief minister said the government will deploy 250 teams to prevent garbage-burning and 75 units to monitor dust pollution, form teams to work on Delhi’s existing and new pollution hotspots and induct 50 engineers in collaboration with the University of Chicago to upgrade Delhi’s existing green war room to provide more robust data. Appealing to Delhi and NCR states to follow in Delhi’s footsteps to take stringent action against sources of pollution, Kejriwal said vehicles plying in NCR and entering Delhi needed to be converted into CNG, thermal power plants in NCR needed to be either converted to clean technology or shut down, hotspots in NCR needed to be identified and, in addition to stopping stubble burning, states needed to provide 24x7 electricity to reduce the use of diesel gensets. The CM said an upcoming e-waste park spread over 20 acres, the continued analysis of data generated by the anti-smog tower at Connaught Place and the ban on firecrackers were also part of the action plan, which aims to cover different sources of pollution through the winter. “To prevent stubble burning, the bio-decomposer solution will be sprayed throughout Delhi for free by us and if the governments of Punjab, Haryana and UP also use this solution properly, then pollution through stubble-burning can be eliminated. We are running an anti-dust campaign and we aim to strengthen it further by deploying 75 teams which will be visiting different construction sites to check dust norms,” said Kejriwal at a press conference on Monday. “We keep monitoring the number of pollution hotspots through a war room and these pots will be assigned special teams to keep the level of dust and pollution in check. The green war room is also being strengthened with a programme management room created in collaboration with the University of Chicago and GDI Partners. We have recruited 50 new environment engineers for the same,” Kejriwal added. In addition to action on congested roads, Kejriwal said 500 teams will be checking pollution under control (PUC) certificates, with 10-year-old diesel vehicles and 15-year-old petrol vehicles to be scrapped. A senior government official said the action plan will be functioning in addition to the graded response action plan (GRAP), which kicks into effect each winter as an emergency measure to control pollution and includes extreme measures such as stopping entry of trucks into Delhi, shutting down construction sites and even enforcing the odd-even scheme. Some components of the plan will come into force immediately, while others will take some time, such as formation of teams. Kejriwal said while public campaigns will be launched in the coming days that are centred around air pollution, he laid down a seven-point agenda for the Centre and Delhi’s neighbouring states, asking for stubble burning to be checked and polluting thermal power plants to be converted or shut down. The CM said he had been tweeting about Delhi’s AQI figures since September 15 to show that on its own, Delhi’s air wasn’t polluted, but pollution from external sources, especially stubble burning, was leading to deterioration in air quality each winter. “For the past few days, I have been tweeting about the AQI figures of Delhi to show how pollution remains under control in Delhi, barring winter. I have an appeal to the Centre and neighbouring states – that we must stop the burning of stubble. If Delhi can help by providing its farmers with free decomposers and eliminate the need to burn the stubble, then other states can come forward and use the same,” Kejriwal said. “Secondly, vehicles coming from NCR to Delhi should be converted to CNG and, like in Delhi, all industries operating in NCR should switch to PNG instead of using highly polluting fuels. Brick Kilns in neighbouring states also need to change their techniques to reduce air pollution and pollution from DG sets can be eliminated if 24x7 electricity is in supply,” the CM said, asking for hotspots in NCR to be identified simultaneously. “These are our appeals with the motive of coming together and joining hands to make our air purer and cleaner, and our people, healthier.” Watch Delhi CM Kejriwal announces winter action plan to tackle pollution||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cms-pollution-plan-jams-to-be-eased-cracker-ban-stays/articleshow/86763992.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

In the police complaint, both the individuals have alleged that in the viral video, the CM can be heard using provocative words against farmers. They also claimed that the video has now been deleted. “In the video, the chief minister was seen giving a speech to the workers of Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kisan Morcha, and said “Uthale Lath! He also told them that if one stays in jail for two-four months, they will automatically become a big leader,” the complaint claimed, quoting Khattar. The BKU spokesperson said that there is a lot of anger among the farmers over such a statement by the chief minister. Terming the statement as ‘illegal’, Lamba has also forwarded the complaint to Hisar SP, demanding legal action against the chief minister, his media advisor and other officials concerned leveling with the case. On the other hand, Cong leader Khowal said that he and his family are terribly scared by the CM’s statement on Sunday and when he shared this matter with his friends in the court, they too were upset.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/complaints-lodged-against-haryana-cm-khattar-over-anti-farmer-remarks/articleshow/86762378.cms||---

The growth is even higher at 17.2% when matched against 100.3 MT of the Covid-free second quarter of FY’20,” said CIL. According to the PSU behemoth, CIL’s total off-take shot up to 147.3 MT at the quarter ending September 21 which is 9.7% more compared to the comparable quarter of last year when the off-take was 134.3 MT. “The company is responsive to the importance of improving coal stocks at thermal power stations. We are rallying our efforts to restore normalcy as early as possible by pushing additional quantities. The demand is far outstripping the supplies now.” said S N Tiwary, director (marketing) of CIL. It claimed that during the first half of this financial year CIL’s off-take to power sector at nearly 246 MT was highest ever for this period so far but the demand from this sector was even higher as an outcome of a sudden spike in coal based generation to unprecedented levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coal-india-posts-record-q2-despatch-to-power-utilities/articleshow/86761627.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court for standard pan-India builder-buyer agreement||NEW DELHI: To protect homebuyers, often at the receiving end of realtor-friendly purchase agreements, the Supreme Court on Monday stepped in and sought the central government’s response to a bunch of PILs seeking a standard pan-India builder-buyer or agent-buyer model agreement. “This is an important issue in relation to consumer protection. Without a standard/model agreement, the builder can put any clause in the agreement which could be detrimental to the interest of the home buyers,” it said. While entertaining PILs filed by Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, Tarun Kumar Gera, Jim Thomson and Nagarjuna Reddy, the bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna was quick to sympathise with homebuyers forced to sign an unequal agreement in the process of realising their dream of a roof overhead. The court said a model builder/agent-buyer agreement was in the spirit of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), which would go a long way in protecting the homebuyers against exploitation and harassment at the hands of realtors. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocates Vikas Singh, Menka Guruswamy, Anupam Lal Das and Arijit Prasad informed the court that under RERA, state governments are mandated to frame uniform/model builder-buyer agreements, but most are yet to complete the exercise even five years after the law came into force. Singh and Guruswamy said under RERA, the Centre has an overarching responsibility to ensure home buyer interests were protected and hence, it be directed to frame a model agreement, which should incorporate clauses to force builders to compensate investors in case of delay in delivery of possession of flats, ensure protection from getting overcharged under heads like interest and late payment and penalise the builder if there were any deficiency in quality of construction. Justice Chandrachud recalled a judgment authored by him relating to the West Bengal RERA. The SC had foiled the Trinamool Congress government’s attempt to run a parallel regime on regulating the real estate industry as the SC on May 4 quashed the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (WB-HIRA), 2017 as unconstitutional for being either a copy or in conflict with central legislation RERA, 2016. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah in a 190-page judgment had said, "The state law fits, virtually on all fours, with the footprints of the law enacted by Parliament. This is constitutionally impermissible. What the West Bengal legislature has attempted to achieve is to set up its parallel legislation involving a parallel regime." On Monday, Justices Chandrachud and Nagarathna said, "If there was no uniformity in the agreement, the powerful builders will force the buyers to sign a contract containing clauses that would leave the home buyers in an utterly vulnerable position." The petitioners said that even after five years not a single state has framed ‘model builder-buyer agreement’ to infuse transparency and fair play that would help curb frauds and delays in completing the project by realtors and stop them from indulging in unfair practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-for-standard-pan-india-builder-buyer-agreement/articleshow/86764055.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This year, the cases in the state had dipped to 237 till October 3 whereas the cases stood at 1,045 till October 3 last year. According to official figures, out of the total 237 cases reported this year so far, Amritsar and Tarn Taran have reported most cases while a number of districts in Punjab have not even reported a single stubble burning case so far. Punjab Remote Sensing Centre recorded 158 cases of stubble burning in Amritsar, 31 cases in Tarn Taran, 11 each in Patiala and Ludhiana, nine in Faridkot, four in Gurdaspur, three cases each in Ferozepur and Sangrur, and one case in Fazilka. Malerkotla, SBS Nagar, Ropar, Pathankot, Mansa, Moga, Barnala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur and Fatehgarh Sahib have not witnessed any case so far. “In 2019, around 330 cases of farm fires were reported till October 3 whereas last year the number was 1,045 while it is 237 cases this year. The arrival of paddy is far less than last year in the grain markets as rains in the last week of September had hit harvesting,” said a PPCB official. Last year, Punjab witnessed a decline of 5.22% area under farm fire than the area recorded in 2019 though the numbers of farm fire cases were much higher. Last year, 17.95 lakh hectares of area in Punjab witnessed burning, whereas on the corresponding day in 2019 around 18.94 lakh hectares of area witnessed burning of crop residue in agriculture fields. The comparative study was carried out from September 21 to November 24 during which stubble burning was recorded and a decline of one lakh hectares of area was witnessed in comparison between 2020 and 2019.

The idea is to provide Karnataka legislators and visiting MPs a space where they can relax as well as debate issues. Assembly speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri told reporters on Monday that the decision to utilise the guest house as a Constitution Club was taken after consulting the ruling and opposition parties. The chief secretary has been asked to take the necessary steps. Kageri said that the new facility would start functioning after some minor alteration, stressing that no damage would be done to the heritage property. The plan to build the club at the iconic site, spread over 14 acres on Palace Road, was first mooted in 2008 when BS Yediyurappa was the chief minister. In 2014, when Siddaramaiah was the CM, there was a proposal to demolish the building and construct a new one. But it was put on the back burner following stiff opposition from heritage conservationists and civil society members. A public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the government’s decision was also filed. In December 2016, a committee decided to set up a recreation centre on 2.3 acres of prime land near the CM’s official residence on Kumara Krupa Road. The plan was to build a swimming pool, health club, spa, gym, library and badminton and tennis courts (both indoor and outdoor). Subsequent state governments also tried to set up the club at Carlton House, another heritage building housing the CID headquarters, but in vain. Balabrooie guest house is a treasure trove of stories from Bengaluru’s colonial past. Constructed in the 1850s, its earliest resident was Sir Mark Cubbon, a British army officer who became the chief commissioner of Mysore in 1834. In 1881, as part of the Rendition, the British gave Balabrooie to Mysore ruler Chamaraja Wadiyar. The place remained the official residence of various commissioners till 1947. Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore visited the property, which, at one point, was also Sir M Visvesvaraya’s office. Later, it became the home of KC Reddy, the first chief minister of Mysore state. Other CMs, including BD Jatti, S Nijalingappa and Devaraj Urs, also made it their official residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/balabrooie-set-to-be-constitution-club/articleshow/86764355.cms||---
---||Goa||Too little, too late? Congress trying to find its feet in shifting sands of Goan politics||MARGAO: When West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee warned BJP of ‘Goa te khela hobe’ (the game will start in Goa) during her election campaign for her byelection in Kolkata’s Bhowanipore two weeks ago, it was actually Congress in Goa that her Trinamool Congress (TMC) was preparing to strike its first blow at. After veteran Congressman Luizinho Faleiro finally ended his 40-year-old allegiance to the Gandhi family to embrace TMC, the blow was indeed telling. For the jolt came just when the party leadership had just embarked upon its mission to resurrect the near-moribund organisation and transform it into a “fighting election machine”, as veteran Congress functionary P Chidambaram and observer for Goa for the 2022 elections chose to describe his goal. While resurrecting the party two years after 10 of its MLAs deserted it to join BJP is itself a gargantuan task, the shifting sands of Goa’s politics has led the party leadership to shift its immediate focus to strengthening the party’s resilience to endure the blow dealt by its veteran soldier and keeping its flock of the remaining four MLAs together. Already, the buzz is that Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco is seriously considering moving over to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and though Lourenco hasn’t confirmed it yet, he hasn’t denied it either. Besides, while uncertainty prevails over whether its Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane will contest the 2022 assembly polls, the party has seemingly already kept its Ponda MLA Ravi Naik out of reckoning following his growing proximity to BJP. Effectively, the Congress is left with a singular active MLA in leader of opposition Digambar Kamat to take on BJP. Political observers, however, feel that the high profile exit could, in a way, turn out to be a fortuitous advantage for Congress. With Faleiro’s exit, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat is expected to have an upper hand in all decision-making manoeuvres of the party, besides expanding his sphere of influence to Navelim, the space ceded by Faleiro. “Having multiple power centres is not good for a party. Faleiro’s departure from Congress could actually help in aligning the various factions within the party,” Rajendra Kaodkar, a political commentator who recently joined TMC, told TOI. Prabhakar Timble, political analyst and a former state election commissioner, also sought to make the blow to Congress appear less lethal. “Time will enlighten us on whether the weeding out of politicians past their sell-by date will prove to be a good omen and energise Congress, or otherwise,” he said. Congress poll managers are now awaiting Chidambaram’s arrival in Goa to rework its poll strategy after the major jolt. Chidambaram, with his professional, no-nonsense approach to election affairs, had managed to bring about a sense of resurgence in the rank and file of the party. However, it will take some time before Congress can find a revival script to turn around its electoral fortunes — 2022 may be too close for comfort, they say. By declaring that betrayers will not be welcomed back into the party fold, and by making its lowly party worker an important stakeholder in the decision-making process, it’s obvious that Chidambaram’s exercise is aimed at shifting the allegiance of the party’s block committees, which are invariably controlled by the respective MLAs, back to the party. However, after a persistent no-decision-on-alliance-yet posturing, Congress in-charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao has now hinted at the party’s inclination to forge a pre-poll alliance with “like-minded” parties. Veteran lawyer and political scientist Radharao Gracias concurred with the view that Congress’ revival attempts are a case of too little, too late. “Congress doesn’t seem to be interested in reviving itself or doing something worthwhile for the state in the coming election,” Gracias said. “That’s why they have come only now. They should have roped in veteran strategists like Chidambaram and others at least two years ago. They should have built the party when it was down in the doldrums. Any attempt at revival at this stage can only be called election convenience, not a party-building exercise.” Despite a strong anti-incumbency wave in favour of the opposition, political observers feel Congress could lose seizing the opportunity because of its poor organisational strength and failure to take timely remedial measures. “Generally, the people of Goa seem to be fed up with the BJP government,” Gracias said, “and most would prefer to vote in a non-BJP government. So, for the opposition, everything is cooked and ready, and voters are waiting. But Congress just doesn’t seem to be ready to take the plunge yet and convert the voters’ angst in its favour.” Timble succinctly summed up Congress’ predicament: “Things appear to shine for Congress, but the party is also beset with elements that are capable of pulling it to its sunset days. There are challenges ahead, but definitely Congress is also in the smelling range of opportunities to wrest power.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/too-little-too-late-congress-trying-to-find-its-feet-in-shifting-sands-of-goan-politics/articleshow/86761710.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh that an application has been filed by the state to implead 43 organisations in the petition filed by a Noida-based women for removal of road blockade on Delhi borders. Mehta told the bench that the state government appointed a committee to hold talks with agitating farmers but they refused to participate. The court had earlier asked the Centre to find a solution after holding that public roads cannot be blocked for a long period to cause inconvenience to the general public and there should be free flow of traffic. It had asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to explore the solution in consultation with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments. The court had earlier also said there cannot be continuing inconvenience for people for a long time by the agitators by blocking the roads and some arrangements had to be made so that people do not suffer. The court was hearing a plea of a Noida-based woman who alleged that it took her more than two hours to commute due to the road block. She alleged in her petition that she was a single parent and it had become a nightmare to travel to Delhi. She alleged that agitation was being done to defame the government and the country. The Supreme Court had last year ruled that authorities, in future, should not permit Shaheen Bagh-type protests involving blocking of roads and public spaces, and said that such expressions of dissent should be organised at designated places without causing inconvenience to the public at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-notice-to-43-farm-groups-over-blockades/articleshow/86764392.cms||---

We asked for it to be removed, but the contractor hasn’t cleared it. It is posing a danger to motorists and inconvenience to residents, many of whom are senior citizens,” a CCP staffer said. The stones have been dumped at Mary’s Colony, Miramar, opposite the Salgaoncar Law College. “The work was not being carried out by a CCP contractor so we brought it to the notice of Smart City office, but no action has been taken and it is turning into a serious problem for senior citizens in the area. A truck load of the ‘khadi’ has been dumped at six places along the road and hasn’t been removed. Smart City that hires the contractor must clear the road for citizens,” the staffer said. The corporation’s workers collect segregated waste door-to-door and have been working to clear up any black spots in and around the city. Contractors seldom leave the road in the same condition they found it thereby inconveniencing residents and posing a risk to motorists where nobody takes responsibility to clear it up, the CCP staffer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/debris-from-smart-city-work-posing-hazard-to-citizens/articleshow/86761745.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||#BackToCampus: We relish the return to this hustle and bustle, say students||Classroom chatter, period bells, friendly faces that aren’t trapped in boxes on screen, romantic corners, canteen banter… for the past 18 months, Kerala’s college students have been missing them all. When colleges reopened again on Monday — though still in the shadow of the pandemic — their excitement knew no bounds. ‘Thank God the virtual-only year is over,’ is the most commonly shared sentiment, as students tell us what the new campus dynamics are like. In-person learning experience, better any day!While many have now become comfortable with the online mode of learning, students say in-person experience feels a lot more lively and better. Eldho Stanley of Maharaja’s College, Kochi, says, “I am a final-year BA Music student and especially in subjects such as ours, the online mode of teaching and practising can be challenging. The live class is a lot easier and I’m happy that now we are back to the hustle and bustle of live classrooms!” Akshara R of St Teresa’s College says it’s a big relief and break for students, who have been learning from their own individual rooms for about one-and-a-half years. “Due to social distancing, we still miss the chats and jokes in class. But still, that classroom vibe, in which you can see your friends and teachers, is special,” she explains. We miss the canteen and hostel banter, youth festivals, social life…The days when canteens and hostels became fun corners, where students played games, watched movies or even studied together, are just good memories now, students say. Milan George of Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvananthapuram, says, “We had a wonderful canteen in which friends used to sit together and chat, eat, sing songs and while away time. It’s been closed for more than a year now. When we see cobwebs and the like in it now, we feel very sad.” As for Eldho, who joined Maharajas to experience its vibrant presence in youth festivals, the pandemic ruined it all. “In our college, we even used to have a music session in the campus centre space on Fridays, during which students used to sit together and sing. Now with the restrictions it is tough, but we are trying to revive it,” he says. Safety is the key wordThe routine double masking, sanitising, temperature and vaccination checks and more are in place in all campuses, and a few have even gone the extra mile to put in place more of security supervision, to ensure that students don’t violate social distancing norms. A Kochi student who didn’t wish to be named, said, “Our teachers keep reminding us that if we don’t follow the basic safety protocols, we will have to return to our tiny screens again. We aren’t allowed to share anything either… and for people like me who used to borrow everything from pencils to food, it’s sad and annoying. But then, we understand that safety is paramount now… though it completely takes away from us a normal, fun college life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/backtocampus-we-relish-the-return-to-this-hustle-and-bustle-say-students/articleshow/86754015.cms||Deepa Soman

Last year, University Grants Commission had formed a task force and also launched a helpline to hear students’ grievances arising out of the pandemic. Based on the emails and phone calls received, UGC found that students raised concerns related to completion of syllabi, technical glitches during online classes, issues related to back papers, etc. “The grievances require actions on the part of the universities/colleges/state government. As per the guidelines issued by the UGC, every university is expected to establish a cell for handling student grievances related to examinations and academic activities during Covid-19 pandemic and notify students accordingly,” the UGC directives state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/term-of-gus-spl-grievance-cell-for-students-extended/articleshow/86761755.cms||---

Congress said that if it forms the next government it will investigate the road and national highway contracts and initiate action against contractors whose work was substandard. “There is one highway contractor who is building small bridges, flyovers and highways. The deputy chief minister is complaining about this contractor, but the government is not taking any action against the contractor,” Congress spokesperson Mahadev Khandekar said. Khandekar, who is from Sakhali constituency, said that if the roads are not repaired by November 1, then Congress will decide its next strategy to go ahead. “If the government changes and our government is there and if an investigation is conducted, this highway contractor will be put in jail. The chief minister said that by November 1 all the roads will be repaired. I urge the chief minister to ensure this or to release all information regarding the tenders and contracts for road repairs for the last two years,” he said. Responding to Sawant’s claims that Goa’s economy and roads were equally bad during the term of the Congress government, Khandekar said that there was prosperity when Margao MLA Digambar Kamat was the chief minister of the state. “When there was a Congress government, the state treasury was full, there were jobs, there was prosperity in the state. The industries functioned well, the roads were good. In the last nine years, the state’s debt has shot up. Where has the money gone?” the spokesperson said. He said that BJP has thrown the entire state into economic despair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/repair-roads-by-nov-1-or-give-details-of-contracts-congress-tells-sawant/articleshow/86761790.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||Why protest when laws kept in abeyance, SC asks farm unions||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the rationale behind farmers continuing their protests, including blocking of national highways, when none of the three contentious agricultural laws are in force as all have been kept in abeyance for 18 months in January by the court after an assurance from the government to that effect. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, "Why is the protest when the three laws are not in force at all? It has been kept in abeyance by the court. There is a stay. The government is also bound by the law enacted by Parliament, isn't it?" This observation came on a petition filed by Kisan Mahapanchayat, which has sought permission to hold protests at Jantar Mantar near Parliament against the farm laws. It questioned the petitioner for moving the Rajasthan HC challenging the validity of the farm laws and simultaneously requesting for permission to protest. The bench said, "Once a party goes to court challenging an Act or action of the executive, then the matter is subjudice before the court. How can the same party say irrespective of filing the petition, it still has a right to protest. Protest against whom? You can move the court and request for deciding the matter expeditiously. No one else can decide the validity of an Act or executive action except the court. It is not for anyone else to judge. It is only the court which can do it. We want to know how a party which has moved the court, can still resort to protest." Attorney general K K Venugopal said, "The government has made it very clear that it is not going to withdraw the three laws. Therefore, the only choice before them (the farmers) is to take forward their challenge to the three laws before the constitutional court." Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta supported the court's view but reiterated that the government is firm that the three agricultural laws - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act - will not be withdrawn and that the government would await the outcome of the bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the enactments. The AG said, "The court is right. No one can be allowed to ride two horses at the same time... Once he has chosen his forum he cannot indulge in both - challenge the legislation in court and go on protesting on the road. If he feels strongly that he would succeed in getting the legislation invalidated, then he should await the decision of the court." Mehta said, "Once the matter is before the highest constitutional court, nobody can be on the streets on the same issue. They must trust the court." At the commencement of hearing, Kisan Mahapanchayat's counsel Ajay Chaoudhary informed the court that his client organisation and its members have broken away from the road blocking protests by farmers organisations after the massive violence and invasion of Red Fort by protesters during the tractor rally violence on Republic day. However, the SC pointed out that their petition challenging the validity of the three farm laws is still pending before the Jaipur Bench of the Rajasthan High Court. It decided to transfer the writ petition to itself and posted it for hearing along with its petition seeking permission to hold protests at Jantar Mantar for hearing on October 21. Justice Khanwilkar-led bench said, "Person who questions the executive order or legislation enacted, if he has already approached the court, why should that person be permitted by the executive to protest, even if it is otherwise permissible. We would like your (AG's) assistance on this question." "The main question that we will decide would be - When the matter is subjudice, how can you protest about that very issue? That is a legal question which we will decide. After that we will decide about giving permission for the protest." On January 12, the SC hearing a bunch of petitions had put the implementation of the three farm laws on abeyance as the Centre had agreed not to implement it in the hope of resolving the farmers' grievances through negotiations. Appearing for eight agitating farmers unions, senior advocates Dushyant Dave, H S Phoolka, Colin Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan had welcomed the SC decision to keep the farm laws in abeyance but had said that they would get back to the court on the issue of willingness of farmer organisations to participate in the proceedings relating to determination of validity of the three laws. The then CJI S A Bobde had made a personal appeal to the farmers unions to withdraw their protests and the SC had set up a committee to take views of farmers across the country on the contentious farm laws. Later, the agitating farmers had refused to call off the protests and Bhushan had told the court that "What their apprehension is - This is a way of putting pressure democratically on the government through agitations and protests. They (the farmers) fear that if they get up and go because the Supreme Court has stayed the three laws, then the pressure on government will dissipate."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-protest-when-laws-kept-in-abeyance-sc-asks-farm-unions/articleshow/86764610.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Drawing Sawant’s attention to the seizure of drugs aboard a domestic cruise vessel in Mumbai which was headed for Goa, Lourenco said that the attitude of tourists that they can do whatever they want in Goa is “despicable” and needs to be “stopped immediately.” “Let us not forget the luxury cruise ship was headed to Goa and that the youngsters on whom narcotic drugs were found or who were consuming narcotic drugs were coming to Goa for a drug trip,” said Lourenco who is set to leave Congress this week. “It is also imperative to take strict action against all those tourists who are not following the law of the land,” said the Curtorim MLA. The MLA has repeatedly expressed concern about the sale of narcotic drugs in the state and has said that the drug culture must not be allowed to “finish Goa”. “Tourists have been found neither following Covid-appropriate behaviour and SOPs issued by the Centre, be it wearing masks or observing social distancing,” said Lourenco. “It is given to understand that recently tourists were found roaming freely with vehicles on the beaches of Goa which causes destruction to the ecology and disturbance to other people visiting the beaches.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lourenco-urges-cm-to-crack-down-on-drug-trade/articleshow/86761832.cms||---

A letter, signed by several employees, has alleged that UTL failed to pay the Provident Fund (PF) amount for two years and also the Employee’s State Insurance (ESI) contribution for employees. The staff have also alleged that UTL has deliberately allowed GBBN infrastructure to deteriorate while giving priority to private customers who are using the same fibre network. “We would like to bring to your notice that for last two years, from 1 October 2019, the company has not paid PF to all the employees. Also, the company is deducting both the shares of PF — the employee’s and the employer’s — from the employees’ salary. For the last one year, the company has failed to pay ESI contribution of all the employees, as a result of which they are not able to avail of ESIC facilities at ESIC hospitals,” said the employees in a letter to IT director Ankita Anand. Anand told TOI that she had spoken to the UTL manager. “I have flagged the matter to the deputy director and the government will follow it up,” she said. The employees have also appealed to Anand for help in getting their pending dues settled. Two months earlier, chief minister Pramod Sawant had pulled up UTL for the poor internet connectivity at panchayats and urban local bodies. Sawant had demanded that necessary steps be taken to “fix the issues” and to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity at the 191 panchayats and 14 municipalities in the state. UTL employees say GBBN and its commercial project GWave are highly unreliable as the company has refused to allocate financial resources for infrastructure and employee benefits. This, they said, has prompted many customers to either give up the service or take back-up internet connections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-broadband-staff-appeal-for-dues-warn-of-stir/articleshow/86761828.cms||---

Ready-to-eat livestock products like Goan sausage, shrimp and duck curry are also on their agenda for this venture, Kumar said, addressing a press conference at Old Goa. “Work has been initiated in this direction wherein we can preserve these items without compromising on their taste, texture and aroma,” Kumar said. To make mancurad mangoes available even during the off-season, he suggested tetra-packing the king of fruits. For the livestock items, Kumar said they are aiming for a ready-to-eat project wherein microwavable food can be packaged and sold. ICAR, he said, is making attempts to help mango orchards, livestock farmers monetise on traditional Goan food items by making them available round the year. Principal scientist (horticulture), ICAR-CCARI, A R Desai said that there will be special focus on enhancing mango production by expanding the area under cultivation. “We will be helping the directorate of agriculture in establishing orchards to increase the area under mancurad cultivation. Once the productivity increases and the number of products increase, then they can be available for processing. These processed products can be promoted as Goan specialities. This way the mancurad can be made known to other parts of the country by offering these products in the off-season,” he said. Desai said that the popularity of this mango variant can be encashed. “In places like Delhi and UP, the mancurad is not known, but by making it available in the off-season could be one of the parameters to attract people from other states while also proving beneficial to Goa’s economy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/icar-looks-at-making-mancurad-mangoes-available-all-year-round/articleshow/86761858.cms||---

The civic body had taken possession of the lake for three years for its rejuvenation. On the request of corporator and former deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the NMCs’ Pench Project Cell to prepare a proposal for regularization of the encroachments and submit it to the collector’s office. The mayor said that the collector’s office had given possession of the lake to Pench Project Cell for demarcating the lake and measuring exact area under encroachment and under water. “ Proposal should be submitted to collector office for approval of state government,” he said. Pardikar said, “The lake was spread across 28.5 acres. In the last 50-60 years, 744 residential structures and 13 buildings of government agencies were constructed on around 16.5 acres. Now, the lake has shrunk to 12 acres.” The corporator said that since the NMC is not undertaking rejuvenation works for last many years despite repeated demands, it should at least regularize the structures. “The government had issued notification on March 6, 2019, allowing regularization of unauthorized structures cropped up on government’s land till January 1, 2011,” he said. NMC assistant commissioner Milind Meshram said that the NMC Pench Project Cell had sought possession of the Lendi lake land from government for rejuvenation in 2018. “The collector office had given advance possession on June 13, 2018, and restricted division or distribution or lease of land for any other purpose. The NMC’s application for regularization of unauthorized structures in 2019 was rejected by the collector office,” he said. NMC’s proposal seeking funds for rejuvenation of Lendi talao is pending with the government. If unauthorized structures are regularized, the lake area will reduce to a great extent and lead to a setback for rejuvenation plan. In the meeting, corporator Abha Pande exposed serious flaws in Parking Policy prepared by Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC). “NMC had paid Rs66 lakh to UMTC and supposed to give Rs16 lakh more. UMTC was supposed to suggest off-street, on-street parking spots, redevelopment of junctions etc. Not a single spot has been proposed in Satranjipura zone which requires it the most as compared to other localities.

---||Nagpur||NIT board okays 1 to 4 times hike in charges||Nagpur: At a time when government agencies are offering various relaxations to people and commercial establishments to overcome the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) board of trustees has hiked its charges by 2-4 times and also fixed high premium for change of user. In a meeting held on Monday, the NIT board led by chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi doubled the charges for mutation from the existing Rs1,000 to Rs2,000. The Rs1,000 fee was decided on October 21, 2000. Earlier, 0.4% of the total sale deed value was recovered. Mutation is done to update the change/transfer of the ownership in the records of city survey department. There were no charges for registration or renewal of flats or shops constructed on leased plot of the NIT. Now, Rs1,100 will have to be paid by the owner of each flat or shop. First-time registration charges for a plot measuring up to 999sqft have been reduced from Rs650 to Rs600. On the other hand, the charges for plots between 1,000sqft and over 10,000 sqft size were fixed at Rs650 earlier. Now, it has been increased — Rs1,200 for 1,000 to 4,999 sqft plot, for plot size between 5,000-9,999 sqft it will be Rs1,800 and Rs2,400 for over 10,000 sqft area. Similarly, the charges for renewal of plots of all sizes were Rs1,100. The same has been revised and it will be Rs2,200 for a plot between 1,000 and 4,999 sqft, Rs3,300 for 5,000-9,999 sqft area and Rs4,400 for over 10,000 sqft. For the plots in economic weaker section (EWS) and Hudco layouts, the charges have been reduced by Rs25-Rs50. In contrast to the NIT decision, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had given rebate of 5-10% in property tax and also it did not hike water tariff to provide some relief to the people. The NIT board cited state government notification, issued on November 19, 2018, to fix high premium for change of user (conversion from industrial to residential and commercial). The government had fixed premium of 15% of the ready reckoner value for conversion from industrial to residential and 20% for commercial. The board decided to levy premium of 15% and ground rent of 2% for change in user from agriculture to residential/commercial/industrial. Similarly, premium of 15% and ground rent of 2% for conversion from residential to commercial/industrial. However, there will be no charges in case of lowering user especially from commercial to residential / industrial / agriculture. The board also decided to issue regularization letters, sanction building plans and approve other pending applications of plot owners who had paid charges to the NMC. The plot owners had paid charges to the NMC, but as the government had later restored NIT’s authority to regularize, the agency had demanded fee from the owners again. With the decision, applications of over 500 plot owners, pending for the last five months, will be cleared now. Considering the demand from trustees — West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, Sanjay Bangale, Prakash Bhoyar and Sandeep Itkelwar, the board decided to approve applications after seeking copies of the charges paid receipts from the NMC. Instead of demanding the fee collected by the NMC, NIT board decided to adjust the amount, nearly Rs125 crore, later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-board-okays-1-to-4-times-hike-in-charges/articleshow/86761907.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Goa||Agri institute to conduct trials to grow potatoes, apples in Goa||Panaji: Goa-based ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute will conduct trials to grow crops that are not usually cultivated in Goa, among which are apple, potato which are usually sourced from other states. “The production of all Rabi crops is very mild in Goa but attempts must be made to make best use of the area under cultivation and grow such crops. The duty of the institute is to try growing new varieties of crops so that the dependence on Karnataka, especially Belagavi can be reduced,” ICAR-CCARI director, Parveen Kumar said. Goa currently sources 320 tons of vegetables – especially potatoes and onions – per day from neighboring Karnataka and Maharashtra. ICAR-CCARI has signed an MoU with CPRI (central potato research institute) to increase vegetable and fodder production in the state to make Goa ‘swampurana’ or self-reliant. Five varieties of potato have been recommended for cultivation in the state – Kufri Surya, Kufri Lima, Kufri Kiran, Kufri Thar 1 and Kufri Pukhraj. “Traditionally the potato needs temperature of less than 20 degrees Celsius to initiate the tuber but the Kufri Surya which is heat-tolerant can initiate the tuber at 21 degrees Celsius. Similarly even the Kufri Pukhraj is a heat-tolerant variety,” Kumar said. The trials will be held at Sattari and Netravali in mid-November where attempts will be made to yield 1,000 potatoes each to determine which of the five varieties are best suited for Goa. ICAR-CCARI also wants to sign an MoU with the ICAR-directorate of onion garlic research, Pune to promote onion cultivation in Goa. “Tropical apples have a very low chilling requirement. There are farmers in Karnataka who are able to grow apples in Karnataka, an attempt that even we can make. We cannot guarantee that it will be a success but we will try to grow them,” Kumar said. Trials for growing muskmelon and cauliflower have already started in the state. “After finding success in Goa we will explore the possibility of growing these crops in other states.” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/agri-institute-to-conduct-trials-to-grow-potatoes-apples-in-goa/articleshow/86761916.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Goa||HC to hear case of illegal buildings near Goa International Airport today||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa will on Tuesday hear a case pertaining to the constructions within the funnel zone of Goa International Airport. The Indian Navy has been asked to submit a timeline for action against the illegal structures that have been identified. During the hearing, the Chicalim panchayat will also submit an affidavit regarding the 74 structures that have come up within the funnel zone without any permission from the Mormugao planning and development authority (MPDA). “The Flag Officer Commanding to also give us the timeline within which the complaints in relation to the structures that have allegedly come up in the funnel zone, in the survey, other than 60/2, will be disposed of,” the high court had said after it posted the hearing for Tuesday. Similarly, the Chicalim panchayat has been asked to submit a “statement about whether there are almost 74 structures, which might be in the funnel area that have come up without any permission from the MPDA”. Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar said that the panchayat’s statement is necessary because when naval officials went to inspect the site around the airport, they found 70-75 structures in the funnel area. “On inquiry, the MPDA stated that they have permitted only two of these structures. Therefore, the question arises as to how so many structures have come up without the permission of the MPDA. The sarpanch will also have to make a statement as to whether any permissions have been granted by the panchayat for these structures,” observed the high court. In February 2020, the high court directed the Navy and director general of civil aviation (DGCA) to initiate action against unauthorised constructions around Goa International Airport within nine months. Despite the directions, no action has been taken and at the last hearing, the high court said that it will “consider whether any action under the Contempt of Courts Act is necessary”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-to-hear-case-of-illegal-buildings-near-airport-today/articleshow/86762034.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Recover profits from clubs commercially exploiting leased lands: HC to collector||Nagpur: In a setback to several top clubs in the city, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday directed the collector to check whether they were permitted to allow commercial activities on their premises as per their lease deeds, and if not, how profits earned by them could be recovered. These clubs include Gondwana, CP, Ladies, Maharaj Bagh, Officers and Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), among others. “The collector should file a detailed reply on whether lease conditions permitted these clubs to exploit their premises for such commercial activities. If not, then how the government is contemplating to recover a portion of profits earned by their management out of it,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. The judges also granted green signal to Sanatan Dharma Yog Sabha to conduct their annual programme of ‘Ravan Dahan’ at Kasturchand Park on the occasion of Dussehra, after the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) cleared its application by providing a no-objection certificate (NOC). The HC orally suggested the applicant to explore land outside the city for staging such events in future. Earlier, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar pointed out that top clubs in the city were given land on lease for charitable purposes at throwaway prices, but all of them were exploiting it for commercial gains and common man wasn’t allowed there. He informed that these clubs offer membership to citizens at a huge premium, thus defeating the purpose for which the land was allotted to them. They even allow their premises to be let out for marriages, exhibitions and other functions, and charge hefty rent from the customers, but do not pass on any profits to the exchequer. While quoting the panel report that probed into affairs of these clubs along with other charitable, educational and cultural institutions, which were set up on Nazul lands in prime areas offered on lease to them, the amicus added that a majority of them had breached lease conditions and brazenly exploited their properties, primarily due to inaction by authorities. Headed by Bhandarkar and comprising chartered accountant Suren Durugkar and collector’s representative Rajesh Pethe, the committee recommended strict action against these erring clubs and recovering a portion of profits earned by them through commercial activities. As per HC directives, the committee conducted its investigations based on affidavits filed by respective clubs, their audited balance sheets and original documents. Surprisingly, a majority of these establishments had shown either meagre profits or losses in their audit reports filed in the collector’s office. # PROBE PANEL REPORT * Top clubs given land on lease for charitable purposes at throwaway prices * All were exploiting it for commercial gains without govt nod * They even allow premises for marriages, exhibitions & other events * They charge hefty rent, but do not pass on profits to exchequer * They offer membership to citizens at premium rates * It defeats purpose for which land was allotted to them on lease||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/recover-profits-from-clubs-commercially-exploiting-leased-lands-hc-to-collector/articleshow/86761922.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||Goa govt to complete 10,000 recruitments by December 31||PANAJI: With the assembly elections fast approaching, the state government has set December 31 as its target for completing recruitments in all departments and autonomous bodies. In June, chief minister Pramod Sawant had said that the state government would fill 10,000 vacancies in various departments over the next six months. On Thursday, he will hold a meeting with all heads of departments (HoDs) and managing directors of corporations, agencies, and boards at the secretariat. A senior official said that the state government is expecting the model code of conduct to come into force anytime after December, and hence has decided that the recruitments should be completed before that. He said that since the code can come into force at any moment (after December), the government has decided to speed up both recruitment as well as project completion. A political observer said that it is necessary for the chief minister to complete whatever tasks he has in his hands before the elections are announced, else it could backfire on the government as a lot of people are aspiring for the jobs advertised by the government. The official said that the chief minister wants to know the status of how many posts were advertised and how many are filled. He also wants to know when new posts will be advertised and the timeline to complete the recruitment. In the next few weeks, more jobs will be advertised, he added. Thursday’s meeting, apart from discussing recruitments to be carried out before December 31, will also touch upon new reforms, initiatives and schemes to be launched or implemented before the end of the year. The meeting will also discuss new projects to be inaugurated before that date. The chief minister has sought details on recruitments scheduled in departments, which have been given a particular format in which they have to furnish details pertaining to the discussion to be held at the meeting. The state assembly election is scheduled early next year. Political parties have already geared up for the polls and even BJP has launched its election campaign to reach out to the voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-complete-10k-recruitments-by-dec-31/articleshow/86762026.cms||---

Named ‘Post Covid Mucormycosis Maxillofacial Rehabilitation Centre’, it conducted the first jaw implant and replacement surgery recently. GDC dean Dr Abhay Datarkar said a young patient from Yavatmal district was the beneficiary as he got jaws and set of teeth and will be living a near-normal life very soon. “Hundreds of patients lost their teeth, upper and lower jaws during the post-Covid mucormycosis infection. This not only brings abnormality in the looks, but also reduces the living abilities. Patients lose their confidence too. We have decided to restructure the lost parts of their face with the help of latest maxillofacial techniques,” said Dr Datarkar. Not only this, mucor survivors who lost their eyes during the course of treatment will get the eye-like implants too. “GDC has undertaken the task of making artificial eyes for 10 such survivors. These look like the normal eyes,” said Dr Arun Khalikar, head of prosthodontics department. At present, the GDC has list of 70 patients who were operated for post-Covid mucormycosis and now need maxillofacial rehabilitation. The first surgery was conducted with the monetary assistance of a private firm. From now onwards, the divisional administration will be providing the funds for such surgeries. Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma confirmed this to TOI. “Rehabilitation of mucormycosis survivors is a major challenge. It’s a costly process and patients hardly have funds to undergo such surgeries. So, the divisional administration has decided to raise funds and help the needy in Vidarbha,” said the divisional commissioner. Nagpur had the highest number of mucormycosis patients in Maharashtra during and after the second wave of Covid-19. GDC alone has a list of 118 patients who have lost their jaws and teeth. “We have list of 70 patients awaiting total face implant. We have submitted the proposal to the divisional administration. We are ready to conduct surgeries once our proposal gets approved,” said Dr Datarkar. Dr Varsha Mandekar said teeth and jaw implants are constructed using titanium, which easily fuses to the human jawbone. “It looks like normal teeth and jaw. Titanium implant is strong, sturdy enough and acts as natural teeth,” she said. The success rate of a titanium implant is from 95% to 98%, which is very good. A Ray Of Hope GDC Nagpur’s Mucormycosis Rehabilitation Centre will be 1st of its kind in state Initially, maxillofacial surgeries of 70 mucor survivors who lost their jaws, teeth will be conducted Titanium implants, having up to 98% success rate, will be used Patients who got operated for mucor at GMC and AIIMS will get benefit first For needy patients, mucor rehabilitation expenses to be covered by divisional administration||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gdc-starts-mahas-first-post-mucor-rehab-centre/articleshow/86761932.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||India||CBI, ED officers appear before Bengal speaker||KOLKATA: Five CBI and two Enforcement Directorate officers presented themselves before Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee on Monday after the Calcutta HC directed the CBI officials to appear before him and “respectfully seek” an adjournment of his hearing. Banerjee had summoned officials of both agencies and sought their explanation on how they could proceed against MLAs without seeking his permission. The speaker’s action followed CBI and ED chargesheets against Trinamool leaders Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee and Madan Mitra and their arrests in the Narada sting operation case. CBI deputy superintendent of police Satyendra Singh had moved the HC, questioning the speaker’s authority to summon the officials. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha gave the order after CBI officers stayed away from the speaker’s office on the ground that the agency had taken the Bengal governor’s sanction for prosecution of Hakim, Mukherjee, Mitra and former minister Sovan Chatterjee. Singh also wanted to know whether the assembly speaker could question the validity of the sanction for prosecution when the issue was pending before the high court. Justice Mantha wanted to hear the speaker’s views before taking up the matter for hearing again on Tuesday. The officers appeared before the speaker at the Vidhan Sabha at 4 pm, in accordance with the HC order, and stayed there for 30 minutes. Neither the officers nor Banerjee spoke to the media after that. The CBI started the investigation into the Narada sting operation in March 2017 after a Calcutta HC directive. The sting surfaced before the 2016 assembly elections in Bengal; several videos showed prominent Bengal politicians and one police officer being offered cash to further a business proposal and some accepting it. The CBI probe report was sent to the Bengal governor in January 2021, seeking permission to prosecute Hakim, Mukherjee, Mitra and Chatterjee. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar granted the sanction on May 7, 2021, five days after the Trinamool handed out a 213-77 defeat to the BJP in the assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-ed-officers-appear-before-bengal-speaker/articleshow/86765322.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Mere availability of the drinking water would not be sufficient to enforce prohibition of carrying drinking water inside the cinema. Purified drinking water with prescribed standards must be provided, so as to satisfy the requirements, Justice Subramaniam said. He made the observation while hearing a plea moved by G Devarajan in 2016 against management of S2 Cinemas and Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Private Limited. The petitioner had alleged that soft drinks and bottled water were sold at much higher prices than the MRP in the cinemas. Opposing the plea, S2 Cinemas submitted that prior to 2017 dual MRP fixation was permitted considering the nature of place of selling but now the practise has been discontinued. At present, products are sold only at MRP prices, it said. Recording the submissions, the court said: “Undoubtedly, there are many such complaints in the public domain during the relevant point of time and even now.” However, the actions taken by the authorities are undoubtedly insufficient and not made available before this court. When such complaints are made an inquiry is to be conducted and truth must be culled out, the court said. If any prima facie materials are traced out and the allegations raised are prima facie truthful, then the authorities are bound to initiate appropriate actions as contemplated under the law, the court added. Adding that the officials are duty bound to conduct periodical and surprise inspections in all the cinema theatres across the state, the judge said, “This being the statutory duties conferred on the authorities, lapses, negligence or dereliction of duty on the part of the authorities must be viewed seriously.” The court then directed the authorities to ensure immediate action on complaints from the public against such issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/theatres-banning-water-bottle-must-give-it-free-says-madras-high-court/articleshow/86765457.cms||---

Though, published records of odonates indicates 88 species, Goa-based ecologist Parag Ranganekar, who is involved in documentation of butterflies and odonates, has reported the presence of 108 species. Besides these, 20 species have been reported and are under consideration for inclusion in published records of odonate species. Two new dragonflies species — Idionyx Gomantakakensis and Cyclogomphus Flavoanmulatus — have been described from the forests of Mollem in 2013 and 2018 respectively. Both species are endemic to the Western Ghats. In fact, the type locality of the Idionyx Gomantakakensis is adjacent to the proposed expansion of the railway track. Speaking to TOI, Ranganekar said, “Dragonflies are good indicators of clean air and water. They prefer living close to water bodies. We have come across dry land species of dragonflies in Surla of Sattari and Sanguem. We are presently studying whether these species have changed their habitat, or due to climate change are found in forested areas.” The globe skimmer dragonfly, also know as the wandering glider, is capable of regularly carrying out long, cross ocean flights. The scientists studying dragonflies have been awestruck by a flight of over 2,000 km across the open ocean by an insect just 5cm long and weighing just 300mg. In Goa, tribals and forest dwellers consider the presence of a large number of dragonflies during the summer as the indication of monsoonal rain. In Rivon, there was a densely forested area known for diverse varieties of dragonflies locally known as Bhirmutigal. "They are very active predators of adult mosquitoes as well as their larva and thus play an important role in helping human beings. Protecting their habitat is important", said Kasarpal wildlifer Subodh Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-has-108-recorded-species-of-dragonflies-damselflies/articleshow/86762064.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

BJP intended to give the chairperson’s post to former chief minister and Ponda MLA Ravi Naik’s son, Ritesh. With no councillor turning up for Tuesday’s special meeting, the no-trust motion moved against Kolvenkar fizzled out. Deputy collector (revenue) at the North Goa collectorate, Ajay Gaude, the presiding officer for the motion meeting, declared the motion fizzled out. PMC is a 15 member body. Kolvenkar, who was Ponda BJP block president, wrested the chairperson’s post on May 18 by defeating Ritesh. Irked with this, on September 27, BJP-backed seven members of the council, including deputy chairperson Virendra Dhavalikar and councillors Ritesh, Vishwanath Dalvi, Archana Dangui, Yatish Sawkar, William Aguiar and Anand Naik, had issued a no-trust motion against Kolvenkar hardly after four months in office. They asked the directorate of municipal administration to convene a special meeting to discuss and vote on the motion. On May 18, Kolvenkar had wrested the post by joining hands with five MGP-backed and two GFP-backed councillors. He bagged eight votes against Ritesh’s seven. Last year, Ritesh and his brother Roy were inducted in BJP despite opposition by a section of the party. According to sources, Ritesh would get the Ponda ticket for the 2022 polls and prior to that, he would get PMC’s chairmanship. Gaude, however, deferred the meeting twice for the want of quorum. However, since no councillor, including those who had issued the notice turned up, he gave up the motion. Kolvenkar is the fourth chairperson in this term of the council. The first chairperson, who was elected on May 21, 2018, was backed by MGP’s Pradeep Naik. BJP’s first chairperson was Venkatesh Naik, who served between August 29, 2019 and August 17, 2020.

The main grievance of 41 doctors who approached the SC was that though the examination schedule was notified on July 23, the authorities changed the question paper on August 23. This had made the bench make caustic remarks against the authorities and warned them of consequences for playing football with the lives of young doctors. NBE said though the changed question pattern will be advantageous to all 12,000 PG doctors who have registered for the examination, it was ready to postpone the examinations to January 10-11 to give students ample time to prepare as per the changed pattern. But, the NBE presented a picture completely different from the one painted by the petitioner doctors. It said in the earlier NEET-SS question pattern, 40% of questions were from the two opted for super speciality subjects while 60% was from the general feeder course, which each and every doctor studies during the normal course. Because of that "a candidate having pursued a broad specialty which serves as a feeder for multiple super specialties, was imperatively getting restricted to necessarily choose only two super-speciality disciplines for admission whereas he/she would be otherwise eligible and available for various other super-specialty courses also having pursued the concerned feeder broad specialty," NBE said, adding that as against 41 petitioners, nearly 12,000 doctors who have registered for the NEET-SS have no complaints against the change of question pattern. The examination body said it felt the necessity, after consulting experts, to remove this restriction of permitting the choice of only two super-speciality disciplines as this would ensure that such a modified methodology would result in minimizing the possibility of precious super-speciality courses seats going vacant. For NEET-SS 2019, a total of 545 DM & MCh seats remained vacant. This number increased to a huge figure of 805 in NEET-SS 2020 after conducting all rounds of counselling including Mop Up round. All these seats got wasted, it said. There are around 6000 super specialty seats (4421 DM and MCh seats and 1969 DrNB seats). Around 45,000 candidates pass out medical post-graduation every year. Around 15,000 to 17,000 candidates appear in NEET-SS annually (NEET-SS 2019:16,206 Candidates; NEET SS-2020: 16,521 Candidates). "Therefore, even though there is no dearth of meritorious candidates available in the merit list to opt for these limited DM/MCh/DrNB seats, still the seats are lying vacant also for the reason that the choice was getting restricted to only two super-speciality streams," NBE said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nbe-defends-new-neet-ss-pattern-as-student-friendly/articleshow/86765573.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
