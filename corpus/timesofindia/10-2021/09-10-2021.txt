The deal aims to end a four-decade-long "race to the bottom" by governments that have sought to attract investment and jobs by taxing multinational companies only lightly and allowing them to shop around for low tax rates. Negotiations have been going on for four years, moving online during the pandemic, with support for a deal from US President Joe Biden and the costs of the Covid-19 crisis giving it additional impetus in recent months. "Establishing, for the first time in history, a strong global minimum tax will finally even the playing field for American workers and taxpayers, along with the rest of the world," President Biden said in a statement. The deal aims to prevent large firms from booking profits in low-tax countries like Ireland regardless of where their clients are, an issue that has become ever more pressing with the rise of "Big Tech" giants that can easily do business across borders. Out of the 140 countries involved, 136 supported the deal, with Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka abstaining for now. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has been leading the talks, said that the deal would cover 90% of the global economy. "Today we have taken another important step towards more tax justice," German finance minister Olaf Scholz said in a statement emailed to Reuters. "We now have a clear path to a fairer tax system, where large global players pay their fair share wherever they do business," his British counterpart Rishi Sunak said. With the ink barely dry on the deal, some countries were already raising concerns about its implementation. The Swiss finance ministry demanded in a statement that the interests of small economies be taken into account and said that the 2023 implementation date was impossible. Poland, which has concerns over the impact on foreign investors, said it would keep working on the deal. 'Decades of increased prosperity' Central to the agreement is a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and allowing governments to tax a greater share of foreign multinationals' profits. US treasury secretary Yellen hailed it as a victory for American families as well as international business. "We've turned tireless negotiations into decades of increased prosperity – for both America and the world. Today's agreement represents a once-in-a-generation accomplishment for economic diplomacy," Yellen said in a statement. The OECD said that the minimum rate would see countries collect around $150 billion in new revenues annually while taxing rights on more than $125 billion of profit would be shifted to countries where big multinationals earn their income. Ireland, Estonia and Hungary, all low tax countries, dropped their objections this week as a compromise emerged on a deduction from the minimum rate for multinationals with real physical business activities abroad. 'No teeth' But some developing countries seeking a higher minimum tax rate say their interests have been sidelined to accommodate the interests of richer countries like Ireland, which had refused to sign a deal with a minimum tax rate higher than 15%. Argentine economy minister Martin Guzman said on Thursday that proposals on the table forced developing countries to chose between "something bad and something worse". While Kenya, Nigeria and Sri Lanka did not back a previous version of the deal, Pakistan's abstention came as a surprise, one official briefed on the talks said. India also had qualms up to the last minute, but ultimately backed the deal, they added. There was also disatisfaction among some campaign groups such as Oxfam which said that the deal would not end tax havens. "The tax devil is in the details, including a complex web of exemptions," Oxfam tax policy lead Susana Ruiz said. "At the last minute a colossal 10-year grace period was slapped onto the global corporate tax of 15 per cent, and additional loopholes leave it with practically no teeth," Ruiz added in a statement. The OECD said that the deal would next go to the Group of 20 economic powers to formally endorse at a finance ministers' meeting in Washington on October 13 and then on to a G20 leaders summit at the end of the month in Rome for final approval. There remains some question about the US position, which depends in part on domestic tax reform negotiations in Congress. Countries that back the deal are supposed to bring it onto their law books next year so that it can take effect from 2023, which many officials have said is extremely tight. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Paris would use its European Union presidency during the first half of 2022 to translate the agreement into law across the 27-nation bloc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/landmark-global-corporate-tax-deal-finally-wins-agreement/articleshow/86877735.cms||---

The status report speaks about the notice issued to the named accused, Ashish Mishra, who was asked to appear before the police at Reserve Police Lines at 10am on Friday (October 8) for recording of his statement. The report also provides details about the health condition of the mother of one of the slain farmers, Lovepreet Singh, as the apex court had directed the government to ensure proper medical care to her. The other parts of the status report comprise of two FIRs, their translation and copy of the formation of the judicial commission and the measures taken by the government to ensure law and order in Kheri. The report opens with the medical condition of Lovepreet’s mother, Satwinder Kaur. The report says that the CMO of Lakhimpur Kheri sent an ambulance and a medical team to her residence in Chaukada Farm, Pallia, in Kheri on October 6. However, the family members told the team that a private doctor was checking her and they refused to send her to the hospital or allow the medical team to treat her. Acting on the court’s order, a medical team reached Lovpreet’s house again the next day following which Satwinder Kaur was examined by the medical superintendent, CHC, Pallia. She was diagnosed with mild weakness and post-traumatic stress, and was advised treatment. The next part of the report talks about the steps taken by the state after the incident. According to the report, two FIRs were lodged on October 4. The first FIR was lodged by one Jagjit Singh against Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unknown people in connection with the death of four farmers – Lovepreet Singh, Nakshatra Singh, Daljeet Singh and Gurwinder Singh –under charges of murder, rioting, rioting with armed weapons, rash driving and others. The report said Ashish Mishra had been issued a notice to appear before the Crime Branch in Kheri on October 8. During investigations, the names of six more persons surfaced in connection with the incident. Of these, three have died on the spot while two others, Luvkush and Ashish Pandey, have been arrested. The second FIR was lodged by Sumit Jaiswal against unidentified persons on charges of murder, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons and rioting. Jaiswal alleged that protesting farmers resorted to violence and killed four persons, namely Raman Kashyap, Shubham Mishra, Shyam Sunder and Hari Om. The report adds that the postmortem examination of all the deceased was conducted by a panel of doctors. A combined team of senior doctors and specialists from Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute went to Bahraich to conduct a second postmortem examination of one of the farmers, Gurvinder Singh, on October 5 under videography. The cremation of all the four farmers was carried out with due respect and in a peaceful atmosphere, the report says, adding that the families of the deceased farmers have been given the compensation of Rs 45 lakh each. The report says that a special investigation supervisory team (SIT) has been constituted under a DIG rank officer to ensure an unbiased and transparent investigation into the two FIRs. The state has also asked people to contact the helpline number and email publicized in the media to help in the probe. The report says that the government has constituted a single-member judicial commission under retired Allahabad High Court judge Pradeep Kumar Srivastava to probe the incident. In the report, the government has also mentioned the status of the PIL filed before the Allahabad High Court. The chief standing counsel of the Allahabad High Court has said that a letter petition has been filed by email but the PIL petition is yet to be listed for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lakhimpur-violence-up-files-29-page-status-report-in-sc/articleshow/86877642.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The last rites of slain principal Supinder Kaur were performed by her family at a cremation ground in Karan Nagar area in Srinagar. Hundreds of members of the Sikh community assembled at Kaur’s residence in Aloochi Bagh area and took out a protest march from there, carrying her mortal remains on a stretcher. A pall of gloom descended as school teacher Deepak Chand’s mortal remains arrived from Srinagar at his home in Patoli Morh in Jammu. Chand is survived by his wife and a three-year-old daughter. He had joined duty in Srinagar on Sunday after performing the rituals of his father’s first death anniversary. Wrapped in tricolour, Chand’s body was taken to the cremation ground amid slogans ‘Pakistan murdabad, Deepak Amar Rahe’. His family and friends demanded immediate arrest of the culprits responsible for the ‘barbaric act.’ Condolences poured in for the bereaved families. Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh described the killing of the two unarmed civilians in Srinagar as a move to damage and attack the age-old traditional communal harmony in Jammu and Kashmir. He added that the killing of innocent civilians reflects ‘frustration and barbarism’.

J&K Police have maintained that the paramilitary troops fired in self-defence as the car he was travelling in ignored a police checkpoint and tried running into the CRPF personnel on duty. Officials said that a checkpoint was established by CRPF’s 40 Bn at Monghal Bridge when on-duty personnel tried to intercept the suspected vehicle without a registration number but it rushed towards the checking party, which then fired in self-defence. The driver of the car managed to escape and one person was found dead inside it. While police are yet to officially identify the deceased, initial reports identified him as “Yasir Ali”. PDP chief and former chief minister of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti, tweeted: “This appears to be the start of a knee jerk reaction to what has transpired during (the) last two days. Disproportionate force has been used by CRPF which has resulted in this innocent civilian’s death. Will there be any action against the trigger happy personnel?” “Yasir Ali (was) killed by security forces at a checkpoint in South Kashmir last night. A heightened state of alert cannot be a reason to open fire like this. Senior officers of the security forces need to ensure calmer heads prevail & nothing happens to worsen the situation,” tweeted Omar Abdullah. “While condemning this tragic killing, I send my condolences to the family of Yasir. Allah marhoom ko magfirat farmaye, Ameen,” he added in another tweet. “In what seems to have telltale signs of excessive use of force by security forces — one person has been killed. Ominous signs. Hope sanity prevails,” PC chief and former minister in the erstwhile J&K government Sajad Lone tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/firing-death-regional-parties-ask-security-forces-to-exercise-restraint/articleshow/86877857.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||Business||136 countries reach historic deal on global minimum corporate tax||MUMBAI: One can say that history has just been made in the arena of international tax. One of the major reforms finalised today at an Inclusive Framework meeting under the umbrella of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Oecd) ensures that Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) will be subject to a minimum 15% global tax rate from 2023. Following years of intense negotiations, today an agreement on the Two-Pillar solution was reached among 136 countries and jurisdictions (which includes all Oecd member countries and G-20 countries). Four countries - Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - have not yet joined the agreement. The solution will be delivered to the G20 finance ministers meeting in Washington DC on October 13 and then presented at the G20 Leaders Summit in Rome at the end of October. From the very inception, India has been an active participant in these discussions. From India’s revenue standpoint, Pillar One which grants taxing rights and allocation of profits of MNEs to countries where the customer base is, regardless of whether the MNEs have a physical presence, is of paramount importance. To illustrate, highly digitalised companies that do not require a physical footprint such as Google and Facebook have a huge consumer base in India. Under Pillar One, taxing rights on more than $ 125 billion are expected to be reallocated from around 100 of the world’s largest and most profitable MNEs to market jurisdictions (countries where the customer base is), each year. This would ensure that these companies pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits. Developing country revenue gains are expected to be greater than those in more advanced economies, as a proportion of existing revenues, states an Oecd release. But, the extent to which the new approach will benefit India remains to be seen. India had taken the unilateral step of introducing an equalisation levy, more as a stop-gap arrangement, till a global consensus was reached. Equalisation levy was introduced from June 1, 2016. Under it an Indian payer is required to deduct 6% on payments (if in excess of Rs. 1 lakh in a year) to a non-resident entity – say Google or Facebook for online advertisements. The scope of EL was expanded by the Finance Act, 2000, to cover non-resident E-commerce operators (whose turnover was over Rs. 2 crore in a year). They would have to pay tax @2% on the consideration received for online sales of goods or services. To curb such unilateral measures being adopted the agreement provides that no newly enacted digital services taxes will be imposed on any company from October 8, 2021 and until the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the coming into force of the agreement. To point out the nitty-gritty relating to Pillar One, “MNEs with global sales above EUR 20 billion and profitability above 10% will be covered by the new rules. Under it, 25% of profit above the 10% threshold is to be reallocated to market jurisdictions,” states an OECD release. The agreement has come in for flak in some quarters. Alex Cobham, chief executive at the Tax Justice Network, said the Oecd has failed to come anywhere close to its original ambition. “Pillar One ‘beyond’ the arm’s length principle, as was promised, for only a sliver of the profits of just 100 MNEs. The tokenistic measure keeps the century-old principle, widely recognised as unfit for purpose, unchanged for almost all multinational profits.” Pillar Two introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate set at 15%. Ireland, with a low corporate tax rate of 12.5% had emerged as a tax haven for tech firms like Google, Facebook and Apple. The new minimum tax rate will apply to companies with revenue above EUR 750 million and is estimated to generate around $ 150 billion in additional global tax revenues annually. Further benefits will also arise from the stabilisation of the international tax system and the increased tax certainty for taxpayers and tax administrations. “Pillar Two does set a global minimum rate, but so low at 15% that the incentives to shift profit will remain substantial; and with the great majority of revenues captured by the US and just a few others,” states Cobham. In the backdrop of Pandora's papers – a global minimum corporate tax rate elicits interest. However, it should be noted that this applies only to MNEs meeting the high threshold requirements. Senior advocate Porus Kaka said, “This is the most radical global reform in the last century”. However, the dispute resolution mechanism is one of the key points to look out for, he added. “Today’s agreement will make our international tax arrangements fairer and work better,” said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. “This is a major victory for effective and balanced multilateralism. It is a far-reaching agreement which ensures our international tax system is fit for purpose in a digitalised and globalised world economy. We must now work swiftly and diligently to ensure the effective implementation of this major reform,” secretary-general Cormann said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/136-countries-reach-an-agreement-to-distribute-mnes-profits-among-customer-centric-countries-and-introduce-a-minimum-global-tax-rate-of-15/articleshow/86877954.cms||Lubna Kably
---||World||McConnell under fire for debt-ceiling as Democrats claim victory||WASHINGTON: Senator Mitch McConnell, long known as the Republican mastermind in Congress, lost support among some members of his own party this week after offering Democrats a temporary deal to avert a cataclysmic US credit default and safeguard the Senate's endangered super-majority rule.  The 79-year-old Kentucky Republican, who had insisted for months that Democrats use a complex procedure to raise the debt ceiling on their own, offered a temporary fix to extend it into early December after the US Treasury said it would run out of money to pay its bills by October 18.  Democrats readily agreed and declared victory after the agreement passed the Senate by a 50-48 majority on Thursday.  "Somebody got to McConnell and finally said: 'Hey Mitch, you know what, are you really prepared to sink the entire American economy and the global economy with your obstinacy?'," Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told reporters on Friday.  While the deal simply postpones the same battle, McConnell's decision to relent raised questions about whether he had put himself at a disadvantage in future confrontations.  "Republican leadership blinked. I think that was a mistake," Republican Senator Ted Cruz told reporters on Thursday.  But Republican strategists and aides said the outcome could give the party increased leverage against President Joe Biden's multitrillion-dollar social spending package, which Democrats hope to pass in the coming weeks.  Republicans believe the high-stakes debt-ceiling debate could make it harder for Democrats to find common ground on the legislation.  "Forcing Democrats to punt the debt ceiling into the (Biden agenda) fight may prove to be very good strategy," said Republican strategist Alex Conant.  A Republican aide credited McConnell's tactics with safeguarding the "filibuster," the super-majority rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the 100-seat chamber. That has enabled Republicans to block many Democratic initiatives.  In the short term, McConnell faces pressure from Republican allies of former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called on the party to oust McConnell from his position.  Senator Lindsey Graham denounced McConnell's agreement as a "complete capitulation" without naming the leader, adding: "We had a strategy and we abandoned it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mcconnell-under-fire-for-debt-ceiling-as-democrats-claim-victory/articleshow/86877986.cms||---

Lobera spent four years in India, three of which were at FC Goa. He won the Super Cup and the League Winners’ Shield for the Goan club before their bitter parting of ways. He joined Mumbai last season and won a rare double, claiming the League Winners’ Shield and Indian Super League (ISL) trophy. The triumph meant Mumbai are now only the second club to qualify for the AFC Champions League, Asian football’s top-tier club competition. But while many expected Lobera to continue for a second year, CFG and the coach had other plans. “As much as I have loved India, I feel the time is right for me and my family to take up a new challenge within City Football Group,” Lobera said on Friday. “I have particularly enjoyed working with colleagues across CFG and I am delighted that I have an opportunity to continue to work with them on a new project.” Lobera is replaced by Buckingham, 36, who joins from CFG-owned A-League champions Melbourne City FC. The English coach was assistant to Patrick Kisnorbo and helped the club win the double of A-League Premiership and Championship. “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time in Australia, but the opportunity to take control of the defending ISL champions was impossible to turn down,” said Buckingham. The former head coach of New Zealand’s under-20 and under-23 teams took charge of Melbourne City for three games last season -- in the absence of Kisnorbo -- and registered an all-win record. “Des is an exciting young coach who already has years of experience under his belt,” said club CEO Kandarp Chandra. “He is incredibly highly thought of within the game and his background at CFG ensures continuity for our squad as we head into pre-season.” Mumbai are confident they have made the right choice and will kick-off pre-season next week. The Indian players arrived in Goa early this week and are undergoing mandatory quarantine, while the foreign arrivals will be complete in the next couple of days. There is no word yet on where Lobera is headed. “Whilst Sergio’s time in India has come to an end, I am delighted that he chose to continue with City Football Group in a fresh challenge. We are very pleased that we will be able to keep working together,” said Brian Marwood, managing director of global football at CFG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobera-leaves-mumbai-for-new-city-challenge/articleshow/86877978.cms||---
---||World||Biden won't invoke executive privilege on Trump docs||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden is not asserting executive privilege over a tranche of documents sought by a House committee's investigation into the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, setting up a showdown with his predecessor Donald Trump who has pledged to try to block records from his time in the White House from being turned over to investigators. In a letter to the Archivist of the United States, White House counsel Dana Remus writes that Biden has determined that invoking executive privilege "is not in the best interests of the United States". The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter Friday, which was first reported by NBC News. In August, the House committee investigating the January insurrection at the US Capitol asked for a trove of records, including communication within the White House under Trump and information about planning and funding for rallies held in Washington. Among those events was a rally near the White House featuring remarks by Trump who egged on a crowd of thousands before loyalists stormed the Capitol. In the letter, Remus writes that the documents reviewed "shed light on events within the White House on and about January 6 and bear on the Select Committee's need to understand the facts underlying the most serious attack on the operations of the Federal Government since the Civil War". Copies of the documents responsive to the request were turned over to the Biden White House and Trump's lawyers for review for potential executive privilege concerns in accordance with federal law and the executive order governing presidential records. The incumbent president has the final say unless a court orders the Archives to take a different action. Trump has not formally sought to invoke executive privilege over the documents, though that action is expected soon. Officials also expect him to try to take legal action to block the release of the documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-wont-invoke-executive-privilege-on-trump-docs/articleshow/86877987.cms||---

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but it bore all the hallmarks of Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), which had recently attacked a mosque in Kabul, killing several people. Video footage showed horrific scenes with bodies surrounded by debris inside the Gozar-e-Sayed Abad Mosque. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, confirmed the explosion and said there were casualties. However, he did not immediately provide any death toll, saying the Taliban were still investigating. "Today in the afternoon, in the Khanabad Bandar area in the capital city of Kunduz, a blast targeted a mosque belonging to our Shia citizens and martyred and wounded a number of our compatriots," he tweeted. Local security officials said over 300 hundred people had been attending Friday prayers when the attack took place. There are conflicting reports about the number of casualties. Dost Mohammad Obaida, the deputy police chief for Kunduz province, said at least 100 people were killed and many more wounded in the attack. "I assure our Shia brothers that the Taliban are prepared to ensure their safety," Obaida said, adding that an investigation was underway. Earlier, authorities at Kunduz’s provincial hospital said that 35 dead and more than 50 injured were brought there, while health officials at the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital in the city reported that 15 dead and 90 wounded were brought to their facility. MSF hospital workers said they feared the death toll could rise. If the IS-K claims the Friday blast, it would be the worst attack in the war-battered country after the group had targeted Kabul airport in a devastating bombing in August. Afghanistan’s minority Shia Muslims, who make up roughly 20 per cent of the Afghan population, have been victims of some of the country’s most violent assaults. Many of them are Hazara, an ethnic group that has been heavily persecuted in Afghanistan for decades. The IS-K has repeatedly targeted Afghanistan's Shia minority in the past, with suicide bombers striking at their mosques, sports clubs and schools. Kunduz is a key transit point for economic and trade exchanges with Tajikistan. The province saw fierce battles as the Taliban fought their way back into power in August this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/suicide-bomber-kills-100-in-northern-afghanistan-shia-mosque/articleshow/86878040.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

From selling traditional colourful garba outfits to junk jewellery, the market is a haven for people looking for traditional lehenga-choli for dandiya nights. But ever since the pandemic, the sellers have not felt the festivities because their regular customers are still scared to visit the market. No sale because of limited dandiya nights When we visited the market recently, the usually busy sellers were sitting idle. They shared that business has been down since the pandemic. “The market is popular for traditional lehenga-choli that people buy for dandiya nights, but only a limited number of events are taking place this year, so we are selling nothing in comparison to what we used to sell pre-COVID. The festive season has begun, and we have been selling only two-three lehengas per day compared to 20-30 earlier,” shares Mini, who has been a seller at the market for 15 years now. Soni, another seller, adds, “Parents would buy such dresses for school functions, but since those are also not happening, our sale is almost nothing.” Sellers share that the sales have dipped because of limited dandiya nights as well‘People are shopping online’Sellers also say that even if there are a few events taking place, customers are choosing to buy the outfits online. “Street market mein toh log aa kar yahin try kar lete hain. But after COVID, people are not taking any risks. Since last year, we have had low sales during one of our busiest seasons,” says Poonam, a seller at the market. Bharti, who has been a seller at the market for ten years now, points out, “This is for the second consecutive year that the festive season is dull for us. Though we don’t have any expectations from this year, we hope our customers return in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-festive-cheer-at-janpaths-gujarati-market-this-navaratra/articleshow/86872616.cms||Riya Sharma
---||Delhi||Have you gotten a call from Jamtara yet?||Case-1Case-2Case-3What the above cases have in common, is that the person receiving the call lost a huge sum of money, and that most of these calls can be traced to one region – Jamtara in Jharkhand. As Trishant Srivastava, writer of the show Jamtara – that captured the place’s homegrown phishing industry – puts it, “These crimes have become so common, that now people say ‘mere saath Jamtara ho gaya’.” Lately, new Jamtara -like hotbeds have also come up in Haryana, UP, Gujarat and Rajasthan. How Jamtara became the cybercrime hubCyber experts say that such phishing scams originate from smaller towns where the police are not that active or are not able to deal with these criminals, unlike in metros, where police departments keep track and conduct raids related to these crimes. Jamtara only came to the attention of the police when the amount extorted or number of cases became too big to ignore. ‘Greed and lust is why people fall prey to these crimes so often’Mukesh Choudhary, a cyber expert and advisor to Jaipur Police, says, “It doesn’t matter whether a person is educated or illiterate, people often end up sharing sensitive details with callers because they don’t verify. I know about an IAS officer who gave remote access to his phone to a scammer. If you don’t know which mobile application the caller is asking you to download on your phone, then don’t download it just because he/she is claiming to be a bank official. People are often ignorant or careless while dealing with such callers and that’s what makes them gullible. Besides, greed is the main reasons why people are falling victim, as they often share their details for free vouchers or gifts. It could even be lust. You need basic common sense to deal with such calls. Always pause, think, and verify.” Fraudsters learn from online tutorialsRed flags to watch out forAnyesh Roy, former DCP, Cyber Cell, Delhi Police, who has resolved many Jamtara cases shares that people should look for these three red flags: - UNSOLICITED CALLS/TEXTS: Treat your phone like you are touching a live wire. If you click at the wrong place, you may end up opening a malicious link. If you get something that is unsolicited – a mail/message/call which you have no knowledge of, then the likelihood of it being a scam is high. - BEWARE OF OFFERS: Treat offers of cashback and free products with suspicion. As the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch. - STAY CLEAR OF THREATS: No professional entity will use threatening language. If you get a message that says ‘if you don’t do this your account will be blocked’ or ’if you don’t verify KYC, your SIM will be deactivated’, then it means someone is trying to defraud you. Jamatara PosterJamtara boys are capitalising on the mindset of getting things for free’It’s been two years since Jamtara: Sabka Number Aayega, a 10-part series premiered. Its writer Trishant Srivastava tells us, “In 2016, I read an article about Jamtara and how people were being conned over calls. At that time it was at a nascent stage and people across the country were not aware of these cybercrimes. Post demonetisation, people across the country were using different forms of digital payment. You could suddenly see a very visible change in society post demonetisation, and e-wallets and digital payments became popular. And there was a sudden rise in cyber frauds. It was the audacity that sort of interested us, and we thought it could be an interesting story.” Trishant adds, “We went to Jamtara and spoke to locals, police, and anyone who could share any information about the crimes. It is a very small town and close to the Naxalite belt. We got to know that these boys are mostly in the 16-20 age group and they used to make 100-200 calls in a day. ” Trishant shares that the cases mentioned in the show are real but the story is fictional. “In banks’ grievance report sections, people mention their card details, so these guys take the details from there or search for images of Aadhaar and PAN cards online, where they are easily available,” he shares. Trishant adds that one of his friends got duped by Jamtara fraudsters, who promised him online booze delivery. He says, “To understand the essence of Jamtara, one needs to understand the essence of cybercrime. The reason for the huge volume of these small frauds is that they are capitalising on human greed – the whole Indian mindset of getting more in less, discounts, freebies, vouchers, etc. These cyber fraudsters are not the sharpest mind, but they have figured out a way to con people.” Trishant Srivastava, co-writer JamtaraImitating a female voice, sextortion after showing a nude video, offering to update KYC: most common Jamtara techniques to watch out forTHE LADY CALLER: In the series Jamtara, there’s a scene where a male teacher – who is teaching his class an idiom ‘Ab pachhtaye hoth kya jab chidiya chug gayi khet’ – gets a call from a male fraudster posing as a woman. Explains Mukesh Chaudhary, a cyber expert and advisor to Jaipur Police, “When most men hear a woman’s voice, they happily agree to talk and do whatever the caller is telling them to. There is also an assumption that as the caller is a woman, it must not be a fraud. What these men don’t know is that the lady caller offering them freebies is a male fraudster sitting somewhere in a small town.” THE NUDE VIDEO EXTORTION: This is another common and gender-specific form of extortion. The fraudster shows a nude video to the victim over a video call via the back camera of the phone. While the victim is watching the video, the fraudster records the screen and then blackmails him. They might even ask the victim to strip, and record that to blackmail them. Cyber experts say that there have been several cases where the victims – afraid of ‘log kya kahenge’ – paid the fraudsters any amount they asked for. Sextortion calls have gone upTHE KYC UPDATE: This is one of the most common cyber frauds. The caller offers to update KYC details on the victim’s SIM card or bank account, before duping them. Callers also trick victims into sharing card details, or to remote access to the victim’s phone after telling them to download an app. FAKE PROFILES: Fraudsters often impersonate IAS and IPS officers on social media, and send friend requests to people. They then ask for `5,000-10,000, saying, ‘I urgently need it, please send it on this number.’ And very often, people end up sending the money. How to stay safe?Fraudsters get DATA from call centres, mobile companies, shopping websitesSunny Nehra, a cyber expert, adds, “Fraudsters follow the hit and trial method. Advanced hackers are selling loopholes in payment gateways and recharges to Jamtara fraudsters. We have also found multiple loopholes in the OTP system, but banks refund the customer on case-to-case basis, rather than fix the loophole. Secondly, these fraudsters often pose as bank officials because they have all the data. If someone calls you and poses as a bank official and has your address, you may end up believing that the person must be seeing it from the bank’s data base. What you don’t know is that your data was sold.” He adds, “Call centre executives from shopping websites, telephone companies, etc are also selling this data. In one case, we found that executives from Gurgaon were selling data to people in Jamtara. These Jamtara fraudsters have now started buying insurance data because they know that people are not that gullible anymore.” In one such financial trail, the Delhi Police found that SIMs and bank accounts of these fraudsters were created with details of migrant labourers of Punjab. Here’s how: Let’s say you go to buy a SIM card and give your thumb impression. The seller tells you that it was not registered the first time, so you press again, and then again. Three SIM cards are now issued in your name! There are also some small banks where the account is created only on the basis of an Aadhar card, and so your details could be used to create an account and carry out transactions, without you even finding out about it! Treat your phone like you are touching a live wireIn the show, on the pretext of giving training on how to join call centres, youngsters are instead taught how to con people via phone callsReport financial cyber fraud to 155260||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/have-you-gotten-a-call-from-jamtara-yet/articleshow/86871858.cms||Niharika Lal

A 153-year-old conglomerate reclaims an airline behemoth after 68 years and several governments, tracing a policy arc from nationalisation to disinvestment to privatisation. It’s also a homecoming that’s been two decades in the making, with the Tatas first making an unsuccessful bid to buy and the government of the day then making an unsuccessful bid to sell its stake. The Tatas finally got third time lucky, marking the first successful privatisation by a government in nearly 17 years. Tata Sons – which bid through its wholly-owned subsidiary Talace Pvt Ltd – quoted an enterprise value of Rs 18,000 crore for the bleeding national carrier. This includes the debt of Rs 15,300 crore that it will take over and the Rs 2,700 crore cash that will flow into government coffers. The rest of AI’s Rs 61,562 crore debt (at the end of August) will be borne by the government. Tata’s offer was nearly 40% higher than the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore set by the government and 19% more than what rival bidder, a consortium led by Spicejet CMD Ajay Singh, had offered. Seven bidders had initially shown their interest by December 14, 2020 but five were disqualified as they did not meet the requirements set by the government. One of the disqualified bidders had approached the Delhi high court but its plea was rejected in August this year. “The Tata Group winning the bid for Air India is great news! While admittedly it will take considerable effort to rebuild Air India, it will hopefully provide a very strong market opportunity to the Tata Group’s presence in the aviation industry… Welcome back, Air India!” Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata said in a note posted on his Twitter handle. Aviation is widely seen as a passion of his – he has a pilot’s licence – and while the Tata Group re-entered the industry via Vistara (in partnership with Singapore Airlines) and AirAsia, it’s the return of AI to the fold that’s been a long-cherished dream. During Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s term, the Tata Group had joined hands with Singapore Airlines to bid for a 40% stake in Air India, which was then the national carrier only flying overseas. Adding Air India in the hangar will make it the largest player from the country on international routes, while it will be the second largest player in the domestic sector, after IndiGo. “Air India provides a unique and attractive international footprint,” Tata Sons said in a statement, adding that more than two-thirds of AI’s revenue comes from international markets such as North America, Europe and West Asia. The airline’s frequent flyer programme has more than three million members. The salt-to-software conglomerate was seen as the frontrunner once the government restarted the sale process after another unsuccessful attempt in 2018. The transaction marks a return to an aggressive privatisation plan chalked out by the Modi administration, which has made it clear that the government should exit non-strategic businesses. It has taken seven years to complete a major privatization of a state-run entity. The government is looking to use the money being spent on keeping the national carrier afloat for social welfare schemes. Air India had accumulated losses of almost Rs 84,000 crore and the government was taking a daily hit of Rs 20 crore. “If you have year after year after year of losses, all these losses have actually been funded, some part by equity, which was a minor part, and largely through the government-guaranteed debt… Taxpayers have actually put in Rs 1,10,276 crore in Air India since 2009-10,” DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said at a press conference, adding that the transaction will be completed by end-December. The sale came with the assurance that none of the 13,500 employees of Air India and Air India Express will be removed by the new owner during the first year. After that, the 8,084 permanent AI employees can be offered a voluntary retirement scheme, civil aviation secretary Rajiv Bansal said at the press conference. The terms of the transaction allow the Tatas to sell up to 49% in Air India after a year, although they can undertake realignment of the airline during the first year itself. The Tata Group will also sign a business continuity plan for three years. While the brand and eight logos will also be transferred to the Tatas, they come with a five-year lock-in, and the new owner cannot sell them to a foreign entity. “Air India’s return to @TataCompanies marks a new dawn for the airline! My best wishes to the new management, and congratulations to @SecyDIPAM & @MoCA_GoI for successfully concluding the difficult task of paving a new runway for the airline to take off! I hope the airline will continue to deliver on its mission of bringing people closer through its successful operations,” civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-regain-airloom-book-rs-18000-crore-return-ticket-on-struggling-carrier/articleshow/86878292.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court slams UP government on Kheri: ‘Only words, why no accused held?’||NEW DELHI: In a sharp criticism of the UP government, the Supreme Court Friday asked why accused Ashish Mishra, son of Union minister Ajay Mishra, hadn’t been arrested yet in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case. Noting Ashish had been booked under Sec 302 of IPC (murder), the bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said it is not satisfied with the action taken and the state’s claims appear to be “only in words”. It added, “We hope it (the state) will take necessary steps”. Advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the UP government, admitted there were lapses on part of the administration and said “what they have done is a hash”. Remedial action will be taken, he assured the court. The SC also objected to the SIT’s composition, saying only local cops are part of it. It said it will study other investigation modes. A CBI probe is not a solution due to “some reasons”, the SC said, perhaps because senior Mishra is a central minister. Is this how other accused are treated: SC The court wondered when the violence and loss of eight lives constituted a serious case, why the state authorities did not proceed in the manner in which they should have. “Is it the way you treat accused in other cases (murder cases) also: Issuing notice to them to appear and not arresting them,” the bench said, adding there are “straight statements” of eye witnesses in the case. Its message: all accused should be treated in the same manner irrespective of their background. Police must act responsibly and with sensitivity in handling the Lakhimpur Kheri case to inspire confidence among people, the SC said. The bench expressed surprise over the state police summoning the accused to appear before it in such a serious offence instead of arresting them. Their remarks followed Salve saying a notice had been issued to accused, including Ashish Mishra. Salve agreed that there is a very strong case against “the young man” (Mishra) and charges against him are very serious. He said a notice has been issued to him as the postmortem report didn’t show any gunshot injury. He said the accused have been asked to appear by 11am on Saturday, failing which he will be subjected to the “rigours of law”, hinting he can be then taken into custody. While deferring the hearing for October 20 when it will further scrutinise the actions of state government before passing orders, the bench said the state should take all steps to protect evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-slams-up-government-on-kheri-only-words-why-no-accused-held/articleshow/86878415.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||2 journalists battling for freedom of expression awarded peace Nobel||NEW DELHI: Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov, who braved the wrath of the leaders of the Philippines and Russia to expose corruption and misrule, won the Nobel peace prize on Friday, in an endorsement of free speech under fire worldwide. The two were awarded "for their courageous fight for freedom of expression" in their countries, chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen of the Norwegian Nobel Committee told a news conference. "At the same time, they are representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal in a world in which democracy and freedom of the press face increasingly adverse conditions," she added. "Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda." Ressa in 2012 co-founded Rappler, a news website that the committee noted had focused critical attention on President Rodrigo Duterte's "controversial, murderous anti-drug campaign" in the Philippines. She and Rappler "have also documented how social media is being used to spread fake news, harass opponents and manipulate public discourse’', it said. Muratov was one of the founders in 1993 of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which the Nobel committee called "the most independent newspaper in Russia today, with a fundamentally critical attitude towards power". "The newspaper's fact-based journalism and professional integrity have made it an important source of information on censurable aspects of Russian society rarely mentioned by other media," it added, noting that six of its journalists were killed since its founding. Ressa, the first Filipino to win the peace prize and the first woman to be honoured this year with an award by the Nobel committee, was convicted last year of libel and sentenced to jail in a decision seen as a major blow to press global freedom. Currently out on bail but facing seven active legal cases, Ressa, 58, said she hopes the award will bolster investigative journalism "that will hold power to account". Muratov, 59, told reporters he sees the prize as an award to Novaya Gazeta journalists and contributors who were killed, including Anna Politkovskaya, who covered Russia's bloody conflict in Chechnya. "It's a recognition of the memory of our fallen colleagues," he said. "Since the Nobel peace prize isn't awarded posthumously, they came up with this so that Anya could take it, but through other, second hands," Muratov said, referring to Politkovskaya. "Igor Domnikov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Stas Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Natasha Estemirova — these are the people who have today won the Nobel Prize," Muratov said, reciting the names of the six whose portraits hang in the newspaper's Moscow headquarters. He also said he would have given the prize to Alexei Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's fiercest domestic critic, who was jailed this year over parole violations he said were trumped up to thwart his political ambitions. In an interview with Reuters in Manila, Ressa called the prize "a global recognition of the journalist's role in repairing, fixing our broken world". "It's never been as hard to be journalist as it is today," said Ressa, a 35-year veteran journalist, who said she was tested by years of legal cases in the Philippines brought by the authorities over the work of her Rappler investigative website. "You don’t really know who you are until you are forced to fight for it." This is the first Nobel peace prize for journalists since the German Carl von Ossietzky won it in 1935 for revealing his country's secret post-war rearmament programme. Muratov is the first Russian to win the peace prize since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990. Gorbachev himself has long been associated with Muratov's newspaper, having contributed some of his Nobel prize money to help set it up in the early post-Soviet days when Russians expected new freedoms. He congratulated Muratov on Friday, calling him "a wonderful, brave and honest journalist and my friend". Ressa was one of several journalists named Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for fighting media intimidation, and her legal battles have raised international concern about the harassment of media in the Philippines, a country once seen as a standard bearer for press freedom in Asia. Russian journalists have faced an increasingly difficult environment in recent years, with many being forced to register as agents of foreign states, a designation that invites official paperwork and public contempt. "We will leverage this prize in the interests of Russian journalism which (the authorities) are now trying to repress," Muratov told Podyom, a journalism website. "We will try to help people who have been recognised as agents, who are now being treated like dirt and being exiled from the country." Reiss-Andersen said the Nobel committee intended the award to send a message about the importance of rigorous journalism at a time when technology has made it easier than ever to spread falsehoods. "We find that people are manipulated by the press, and... fact-based, high-quality journalism is in fact more and more restricted," she told Reuters. It was also was a way to shine a light on the difficult situations for journalists, specifically under the leadership in Russia and the Philippines, she added. "I don't have insight in the minds of neither Duterte, nor Putin. But what they will discover is that the attention is directed towards their nations, and where they will have to defend the present situation, and I am curious how they will respond," Reiss-Andersen told Reuters. The Kremlin congratulated Muratov. "He persistently works in accordance with his own ideals, he is devoted to them, he is talented, he is brave," said spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The Nobel peace prize will be presented on December 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/2-journalists-battling-for-freedom-of-expression-awarded-peace-nobel/articleshow/86878512.cms||---

The minister said he has also urged the Elon Musk-led company to have its manufacturing unit in India and export from here. Gadkari’s comments reflect a caution on China following border tensions even as trade in several areas continues. “Whatever support you (Tesla) want, will be provided by our government,” Gadkari said while addressing an event. Gadkari said he was holding dialogues with Tesla officials regarding the company’s demand related to tax concessions. Minister in favour of raising speed limit on NHs to 140kmph: Highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday also pitched for increasing the speed limit of vehicles on national highways and expressways, and said his ministry is in favour of increasing the maximum limit to 140 kmph, but the Supreme Court and high courts need to be convinced about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-get-china-made-cars-nitin-gadkari-to-tesla/articleshow/86878737.cms||---
---||World||US delegation to meet Taliban in first high-level talks since pullout: Officials||WASHINGTON: A US delegation will meet with senior Taliban representatives in Doha on Saturday and Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting at a senior level since Washington pulled its troops from Afghanistan and the hardline group took over the country, two senior administration officials told Reuters.  The high-level US delegation will include officials from the State Department, USAID and the intelligence community, and will press the Taliban to ensure continued safe passage for American citizens and others out of Afghanistan and to release kidnapped US citizen Mark Frerichs, the officials said.  Another top priority will be to hold the Taliban to its commitment that it will not allow Afghanistan to again become a hotbed for Al-Qaeda or other extremists while pressing the group to improve access for humanitarian aid as the country faces the prospect of a "really severe and probably impossible to prevent" economic contraction, US officials said.  US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who has for years spearheaded dialogue with the Taliban and been a key figure in peace talks with the group, will not be part of the delegation.  The US team will include the State Department's deputy special representative Tom West as well as top USAID humanitarian official Sarah Charles. On The Taliban side, cabinet officials will be attending, officials said.  "This meeting is a continuation of the pragmatic engagements with the Taliban that we've had ongoing on matters of vital national interest," said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  "This meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions. They need to establish a sustained track record," the official said.  The United States' two decades-long occupation of Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in August which saw more than 124,000 civilians including Americans, Afghans and others being evacuated as the Taliban took over. But thousands of other U.S.-allied Afghans at risk of Taliban persecution were left behind.  Washington and other Western countries are grappling with difficult choices as a severe humanitarian crisis looms large over Afghanistan. They are trying to formulate how to engage with the Taliban without granting it the legitimacy it seeks while ensuring humanitarian aid flows into the country.  Many Afghans have started selling their possessions to pay for ever-scarcer food.  The departure of US-led forces and many international donors robbed the country of grants that financed 75 per cent of public spending, according to the World Bank.  While there was an improvement for humanitarian actors get access to some areas that they haven't been in a decade, problems still persisted, the US official said, adding that the delegation would press Taliban to improve.  "Right now, we are facing some real access issues....There are a lot of challenges in ensuring that female aid workers are provided unimpeded access to all areas," the official said and added that Washington needed to see an improvement by the Taliban on this front "if we are to contemplate even more robust humanitarian assistance". Pressure on women rights While the Taliban has promised to be more inclusive than when it led the country from 1996 to 2001, the United States has repeatedly said it will judge the new Taliban government based on its deeds not its words.  The Taliban drew from its inner high echelons to fill top posts in Afghanistan's new provisional government announced last month, including an associate of the Islamist militant group's founder as premier and a wanted man on a U.S. terrorism list as interior minister. There were no outsiders and no women in the cabinet.  The European Union foreign policy chief said on Sunday its behavior up to now was "not very encouraging."  "We will certainly press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans including women and girls and to form an inclusive government with broad support," the U.S. official said.  He added that there were discrepancies between the Taliban's promises of continued safe passage and implementation.  "As a practical matter, their implementation of their commitments have been uneven. It is true that sometimes we receive assurances from certain levels but then follow through on those assurances has truly been uneven," the official said.  The United States has directly facilitated the departure of 105 U.S. citizens and 95 lawful permanent residents out of Afghanistan since Aug. 31, when U.S. withdrawal was completed, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday.  He declined to provide a precise figure for those remaining, but said the agency was in contact with "dozens of Americans in Afghanistan who wish to leave" but that the number was dynamic and constantly changing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-delegation-to-meet-taliban-in-first-high-level-talks-since-pullout-officials/articleshow/86878858.cms||---

"We're aware that some people and businesses are having trouble accessing Facebook products," a spokesperson told AFP.  "We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience."  Facebook did not provide details on the cause or scope of the problems, which caused users to flock to Twitter to voice frustration.  "What's up with Instagram," read a tweet that included a picture of cartoon character Bart Simpson sitting in a corner in apparent punishment.  "It's not even 4 days and it's already down again."  Website trouble tracker DownDetector showed spikes in reports of problems accessing or using Facebook and its photo-centric Instagram network as well as Messenger and WhatsApp.  "Problems with Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp AGAIN," read a lament in a DownDetector chat forum.  Hundreds of millions of people were unable to access Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp for more than six hours on Monday, underscoring the world's reliance on platforms owned by the Silicon Valley giant.  In an apologetic blog post, Santosh Janardhan, Facebook's vice-president of infrastructure, said that day's outage was caused by "configuration changes" on routers that coordinate network traffic between data centers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/days-after-massive-outage-facebook-says-some-users-struggling-to-access-its-services-again/articleshow/86878863.cms||---

Ashish missed his summons for Friday. Maintaining that Ashish wasn’t involved in Tikunia violence and he has ample proof to establish this, Teni said his son would present himself before the investigative agencies on Saturday. The minister, who spoke to reporters after landing at Lucknow airport, said, “He (Ashish) will present himself in front of investigative agencies with evidence to prove his innocence. The digital record of the phone location will prove that my son was not at the spot when the incident happened. If you have watched the videos of October 3, you would know that disguising as farmers, rioters lynched people. I believe my son, too, would have been murdered had he been present at the spot.” “This is a BJP government led by Yogi Adityanath and there will be an unbiased probe,” said Teni. DIG (Headquarters) Upendra Agarwal, who is heading the probe team, waited for Ashish but he didn’t show up. The latest notice, pasted on Friday, warned Ashish of legal action against if he failed to appear on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ministers-son-skips-kheri-summons/articleshow/86879042.cms||---

---||Agra||20 kids among 25 dead due to fever in Agra in a week||AGRA: At least 20 of the 25 people who died of high fever with dengue-like symptoms in Agra district over the past one week were children, according to health authorities here . Among them, five children below the age of 15 died in the past 24 hours. In the past one month, more than 250 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra district and 52 of the 65 people who died in the district were children, the health department officials said. The high incidence of fever has not only taken a toll on the patients but also stretched the government medical facilities to breaking point. People in rural areas are the worst-hit as the government–run medical facilities at most places do not have a doctor. People have been forced to either pay large sums of money for treatment at private clinics or depend on quacks. Santosh Singh of Sarai Jairam village said, “My 10-month-old son was suffering from fever for the last four days. We got medicines for him from a private clinic as no doctor was available at the government centre. On Thursday evening, his condition deteriorated. He died on the way to SN Medical College (SNMC).” Virendra Singh of Modipura village under Pihanat block said, “Most of the people suffering fromhigh fever are dependent on quacks as the govtcentres are full.” Each family has a member or two suffering from high fever, said Mukesh Chaudhary of Midkoli village. The community health centre at the village is not admitting patients while the district hospital and SNMC are 60 km from there, he added. Meanwhile, three more patients succumbed to high fever over the last 24 hours in Firozabad district, two in Etah, one in Kasganj and one in Mainpuri. The Agra division accounted for more than 5,000 cases of dengue since August with Firozabad district registering the maximum at 4,580 cases, Mathura 610 cases, Agra 250 and Mainpuri 120 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/20-kids-among-25-dead-due-to-fever-in-agra-in-a-week/articleshow/86876194.cms||---

Nobody, irrespective of his or her party affiliation, will be spared. However, as per Supreme Court, we cannot arrest anyone on the basis of mere allegations levelled by someone. A case has been filed on the basis of a written complaint and investigation into the incident is under way,” the Uttar Pradesh CM said when asked about the possible resignation of Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni and arrest of his son Ashish Mishra, who is named in the FIR. “All will be crystal clear. There will be no injustice with anyone. No one will be allowed to take law in his hands but no action will be taken under any pressure,” he said. Yogi said the government’s main job following such an incident was to maintain peace and harmony. Opposition leaders who were making a beeline for Lakhimpur were no goodwill messengers. The CMs of Chhattisgarh and Punjab, he said, had been unable to manage their own states but were targetting his government to hide their failures. “Where were Rahul and Priyanka and Akhilesh Yadav when Covid was on the rampage? Everyone, including the families of the victims, said that they appreciated the government’s work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wont-act-under-pressure-arrest-on-basis-of-proof-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/86879140.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna said a digital divide produced stark consequences during the pandemic as right to education was virtually denied to children belonging to economically weaker sections as they could not afford gadgets. “Needs of young children who are the future of country cannot be ignored. Some solution has to be found out so that access to education is not denied to those who do not have resources and it is the responsibility of both the Centre and states,” the bench said. The bench commended the Delhi HC for passing a comprehensive verdict directing the state to provide assistance to such students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/free-gadgets-for-poor-students-government-duty-supreme-court/articleshow/86879290.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Will dismantle terror ecosystem: LG Manoj Sinha||NEW DELHI: Strongly condemning the recent attacks in Jammu and Kashmir on civilians, including a Kashmiri Pandit and a Sikh school principal, J&K Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha on Friday said the latest trend of terrorist strikes against ‘soft and easy’ targets shall be dealt with an iron hand, with the revised strategy focused on dismantling the entire terror eco-system. “We have posted the best police officers across J&K. A strategy review meeting was held on Wednesday and the revised action-plan has been rolled out. Counter-terror action is underway since last night. We are confident about containing these ‘soft-target’ attacks. We shall not buy peace but instead establish peace. Terror eco-system has to be dismantled whether here or elsewhere. It is our duty and responsibility to secure the people and their livelihood and we shall discharge it with utmost sincerity,” Sinha said in an exclusive chat with TOI. According to sources, one Lashker e Taiba was killed in an encounter in Natipora on Friday evening, while another managed to escape. The dead terrorist is believed to have been linked to the recent attacks. Sinha has visited the grief-stricken families of M L Bindroo, the pharmacist and Kashmiri Pandit killed by terrorists earlier this week, and Sikh lady principal Supinder Kaur, and assured them that government and security agencies would spare no effort to identify the perpetrators of targeted attacks and take strictest action against them. Sources in the security agencies told TOI that the string of attacks this month, which have killed 7 civilians including four from the minority community, were carried out by young Kashmir boys, all neo-recruits lured by Pakistani handlers to go for one-off attacks on easy targets with pistols supplied by other terrorists. They possibly work for drugs or money, and the pistols are taken from them after the attack, allowing them to go back to their normal lives. Among the 28 civilians killed by terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir so far this year, seven were non-Muslims, including 1 Kashmiri Pandit, while 21 were Muslims. In 2020, of the 37 civilians killed, 34 were Muslims and 3 non-Muslims. As many as 38 Muslims and 6 non-Muslims were killed by terrorists across J&K in 2019. Most Muslims were targeted either because of their political affiliation, particularly with the BJP, or their association with the security forces. Of the 7 non-Muslims killed by terrorists this year, five belonged to the local Hindu or Sikh communities and two were non-local Hindu labourers. A source said the terrorists have been choosing their targets consciously to send out a message. Earlier, they were targetting panchayati raj institution representatives and workers. Now, victims of their targetted killings have changed. Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit who had stayed on despite the mass exodus by his community in Nineties, was targeted to protest against the J&K government’s initiative to allow Kashmiri migrants to reclaim their properties in the Valley through a portal. A J&K government functionary said 5,728 applications were received in the three weeks since launch of the portal, of which 2,349 cases have been closed. Virendra Paswan, the small-time street vendor from Bihar, was targeted to send the message that let alone letting industrial investment flow into J&K, an outsider would not be allowed to earn even a measly Rs 100 a day in Kashmir. A source pointed out that inadvertent attempts by some J&K politicians to identify places in the Valley by names like ‘Bihari chowk’ could have exposed outsiders to terrorists’ ire. Also, the school principal was a clear target against the Sikh community. The intention was to kill the principal though another teacher also got killed inadvertently. A police source said the school was recceed earlier by the local terrorists. There was no lining up of victims though. There is clear evidence that the terrorists are acting on directions of handlers based across the border. By hitting minority victims, the design may also be to disturb communal harmony in other parts of the country, said an officer. The J&K police is working on several leads, including one that points to the presence of some Pakistani terrorists in Srinagar downtown ahead of the attacks and their departure just before they were executed. The police suspect that the Pakistani terrorists were ‘handlers’ who had come to deliver pistols to the perpetrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-dismantle-terror-ecosystem-l-g-manoj-sinha/articleshow/86879475.cms||Bharti Jain

Although the airline itself is not listed any more — it was delisted in the mid-1950s after the government took over — punters were picking up select Tata stocks since mid-September, when the final date for putting in bids ended. The recent rally in the Tata stocks has added nearly Rs 1 lakh crore to the group’s combined market value since September 14 this year, with the current tally at Rs 23.4 lakh crore, BSE data showed. The biggest gainer in terms of mcap has been Titan, which added about Rs 26,800 crore to its own and the group’s combined worth. The watches-to-jewellery major was followed by a Rs 25,533-crore addition by Tata Motors and another Rs 18,551 crore by TCS, the second-most valued company in India. In terms of stock prices, the two biggest gainers were relatively smaller companies within the group. The stock price of Nelco jumped 63% in less than a month, while TRF, the group company that is into manufacturing of industrial machineries, jumped 46%. The third-biggest gainer was Tata Power, which jumped 33%. In Friday’s market, the TCS stock added 1.1% ahead of its quarterly results that came after the day’s session closed, while Tata Steel went up by about 1% and Titan closed nearly 1% lower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-cos-add-rs-1l-cr-mcap-since-mid-sept/articleshow/86879412.cms||---

They want to put up a good show through elaborate decorations so that devotees have a lovely time on Saptami when all the pandals will be thrown open to them. A large replica of the Boudha Stupa, a world heritage site in Kathmandu, has been created in Kadamkuan by Shree Shree Navyuvak Sangh Durga Puja Samiti. Painted in shades of red, white, and golden, the pandal has intricate designs made of thermocol, cardboard, and bamboo sticks. The chairperson of the committee, Arjun Yadav, told this reporter that the 40-foot-high and 25-foot-wide pandal looked exactly like the original stupa. “A statue of Lord Buddha will also be put up at the entrance of the pandal which has been barricaded. Besides, the road leading to the pandal will be decorated with LED lights,” he added. Talking about the precautions being taken amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Arjun said, “There will be separate queues for the entry and exit of men and women. Sanitisers and face masks will also be made available.” Yuva Ekta Manch Durga Puja Samiti has replicated Mount Kailash in Rajendra Nagar. The 20-foot-high pandal has a waterfall-like structure on top of which there is a figure of Goddess Parvati. Bablu Sao, the general secretary of the committee, pointed out that waterfalls and mountains had been their pandal’s theme for the last 10 years. “It is believed that Mount Kailash was the abode of Lord Shiva. He lived there along with Goddess Parvati and their children, Lord Ganesh and Lord Kartikeya,” Bablu said and added, “The structure is visible even from a distance as it is 20 feet high and 50 feet wide. It will be ready by October 11 as our workers are working day and night.” The Gorimath Puja Committee, on the other hand, has made an exact copy of a Thai temple in Mithapur because “its vibrant colours will attract visitors”. It is 35 feet high while the idol of Goddess Durga is 10 feet high. The committee’s chairman, Dharmendra Kumar, said the pandal would be a treat for the eyes. “A three-day vaccination camp will also be organized at the pandal with the help of the health department and a selfie zone created here. Our purpose is to ensure that Durga Puja celebrations do not lead to the spread of the virus,” he added. A replica of Kedarnath Temple is being made in Anandpuri and a copy of the Ram Mandir in Defence Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/durga-puja-pandals-temple-replicas-to-be-a-treat-for-eyes/articleshow/86876048.cms||Faryal Rumi

After scaling down their exposure to the mutual fund industry between April and November 2020, especially through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route, retail investors are again investing through this route like never before. On Friday, MF industry trade body AMFI said that in September, total inflow through the SIP route was Rs 10,351 crore, the highest ever number, surpassing the previous high of Rs 9,923 crore in August. In the first half of the current fiscal, in four out of six months, monthly SIP inflows were over Rs 9,000 crore. According to N S Venkatesh, chief executive, AMFI, SIP contributions breaching the Rs 10,000-crore milestone is reflective of continued confidence of retail investors in MFs. “Retail investors are preferring MFs over low-yielding traditional savings avenues like bank FDs, gold and real estate,” Venkatesh said. He expects that on the back of rapidly improving economic scenario aided by conducive RBI policy and easing of Covid-related restrictions, stocks would continue to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. Boosted by strong SIP flows, the total assets managed by the MF industry also went past the Rs 36 lakh crore from the first time, to settle at Rs 36.6 lakh crore, AMFI data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/monthly-sip-inflow-at-over-rs-10k-cr-in-sept/articleshow/86879303.cms||---

Police had raided Sonu’s residence at Khardaha Tola Jalalpur village under the Bheldi police station area in Saran district on Tuesday and recovered Rs 6 lakh of looted money, a country-made pistol and five live cartridges. Sonu’s father Chandeshwar Pandey was arrested. Sonu’s mother Sanju was one of the five accused in Rs 40 lakh loot that had taken place near Israuli village under the Marhaura police station area in Saran district on Monday evening. SHO of Bheldi police station Arun Kumar Singh, however, said police had not assaulted or thrashed the Chandeshwar during the raid. “Though Chandeshwar claimed Sonu had not come home for the last two months, Ruby showed police the place where money, arms and ammunition were kept by her brother. We, therefore, arrested Chandeshwar,” the SHO said, adding no family member initially turned up to take bodies of Ruby and Sanju after post mortem. He said Chandeshwar’s brother Vijay Pandey from Jalalpur and Sonu’s cousin Raju Singh from Kharpur village under the Derni police station area in Saran later took the bodies after police persuaded them and the cremation took place on Thursday. Singh said since no family member came forward to give statement to police in the suicide case, a case of unnatural death was registered based on the statement of the village chowkidar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-didnt-assault-father-of-loot-accused/articleshow/86876846.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Jain will now be sent to Ahmedabad civil hospital, while a local court remanded him to eight days of police custody on Thursday. “We couldn’t collect Jain’s semen samples at SSG Hospital. He will be taken to Ahmedabad civil hospital for the same test for collecting his sperm samples,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime) who is investigating the case, adding that it happens when the person is nervous or scared. Jain, who was on the run after a complaint of rape was filed against Jain and Raju Bhatt at Gotri police station on September 19, was finally nabbed by the crime branch from Palitana on Thursday. Investigators said that Jain has refused to admit his crime and said that he has done nothing wrong. He, however, admitted to visiting the survivor’s residence. The police said that their investigation is now focussed on gathering evidence against Jain and jointly interrogating him with key witness Alpesh Vadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi. When asked about the memory card of the spy camera installed at the girl’s residence, Chauhan said, “The camera doesn’t have a memory card. One can connect mobile phone to the camera and monitor the happenings any time on the phone.” The cops are also trying to recover the mobile phone that was used to send the girl’s nude photos to her friend Alpu. Raju Bhatt, who is a co-accused in the rape case, has already been arrested along with his friend Kanji Mokaria. The investigation will also focus on ascertaining the places where Jain was hiding when he was on the run and who had helped him. “The girl has been mentioning about a property deal which he was handling on the behalf of Jain. She has alleged that he had asked her to keep physical relations with some of the investors in the deal. We are trying to get more details of it,” the police said. The girl, who is a native of Haryana, had stated in her rape plaint that she was undergoing training at Jain’s CA firm and he used to visit her residence often.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rape-accused-ca-fails-potency-test/articleshow/86876504.cms||---

His memories will reside in our hearts forever,” Nitish said. Though leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav was conspicuous by his absence, his elder brother and RJD MLA from Hasanpur, Tej Pratap Yadav, reached the LJP office to pay tributes to the departed leader. Tej said Paswan’s contribution to the uplift of the downtrodden would always inspire leaders from younger generation. “He had familiar relations with our family. I used to see him at our parents’ house when I was a child,” Tej said. State education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Mangal Pandey, Agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh, VIP chief and state animal husbandry and fisheries resources minister Mukesh Sahani, MPs Veena Devi and Choudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser and MLC Sanjay Singh also paid floral tributes to senior Paswan. At 12, Janpath Marg in New Delhi, the departed leader’s son, Chirag Paswan, organised a separate function, which was graced by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and former Congress MP Rajiv Shukla among others. Chirag faction’s Bihar chief, Raju Tiwari, said the function started at 3pm and concluded at 5pm. “Leaders cutting across party lines paid homage to the departed soul. A host of leaders from Bihar were also present,” he added. Chirag had earlier organised a function in Patna on September 12 which was attended by deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, Union minister Nityanand Rai, health minister Mangal Pandey and RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Nitish had, however, skipped the function. Chirag had earlier blamed JD(U) for the coup in the LJP founded by his father. Recently, the Election Commission allotted different names and poll symbols to the warring groups. While Paras group was named Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party with sewing machine its symbol, Chirag faction was named Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) with helicopter as its symbol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-attends-paswans-death-anniv-function-in-patna-lalu-in-delhi/articleshow/86879126.cms||Ramashankar

Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Varla Devasthanam (SDMSD) executive officer D Bramaramba explained that a complaint was lodged and a case registered against a local TV channel and Nizamabad-based LED screen contractor Keerthi Taranga Creations in One Town police station in Vijayawada under sections 295A (deliberate and malicious act, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of IPC. Two persons were taken into custody. Temple officials condemned the claims of “false propaganda” by some political leaders, who alleged the video of a non-Hindu programme was played as part of proselytisation efforts. The incident took place at around 8.30 pm on Thursday when the video of a non-Hindu priest preaching appeared on the screen. An internal inquiry revealed that the operator continued to telecast the video despite being asked to stop playing it. Bramaramba said the local TV channel and the screen operator were contracted to cover the festivities live and telecast it. “It’s purely accidental (the video playing on the screen), and the operator responsible failed to switch off the screen and continued playing the channel after the live programme ended,” Bramaramba said, addressing the media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/furore-after-non-hindu-video-played-at-durga-temple/articleshow/86876187.cms||---

The price of diesel in Mumbai rose to Rs 99.92 per litre, and it seems that in a day or two, the financial capital will have the dubious distinction of becoming the country’s first metro to see diesel hit a century as high taxes amplify the impact of elevated crude. On May 29, Mumbai had become the first metro to see petrol hit a century. It is now at a new all-time high of Rs 109.54 per litre in the city and Rs 109.68 in Thane and Navi Mumbai. While a price of Rs100 a litre has become normal for petrol since February, diesel topped Rs100 on October1 in several cities of Rajasthan, MP, Odisha, Telangana and AP — all states with high VAT. The price stood at Rs106.03 a litre in Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar on Friday, the highest in the country.

---||Business||Digital payments for biz get a boost||Mumbai: Digital payments for business have got a big boost with RBI hiking the limit for immediate payment service (IMPS) to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2 lakh. The central bank also sought to widen the horizons for digital payments by creating a framework to allow electronic payments even when there is no connectivity. To ensure a balanced spread of digital acceptance, RBI made it mandatory for payment service providers to geotag every card swipe machine and QR code acceptance they deploy. According to Amrish Rau, CEO, Pine Labs, the hike in IMPS limit opens the opportunity to bring digital payments into the B2B segment, along with high-value retail transactions. “I see this benefitting in inward remittance transactions too. I can see in future UPI limits increasing too and this will mean a lot of high-value transactions will move especially on collections to UPI or IMPS,” said Rau. He added that outward payments by vendors or business partners will have more digitisation. “With RTGS now operational round the clock, there has been a corresponding increase in settlement cycles of IMPS, thereby reducing the credit and settlement risks. In view of the importance of the IMPS system in the processing of domestic payment transactions, it is proposed to increase the per-transaction limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh,” RBI said. The increase in digital payments has resulted in a corresponding increase in digital frauds. To counter this RBI has decided to rope in fintech expertise to develop fraud mitigation measures. “With a view to preparing the fintech eco-system, it is proposed that the topic for the Fourth Cohort would be ‘Prevention and Mitigation of Financial Frauds’. The focus would be on using technology to reduce the lag between the occurrence and detection of frauds, strengthening the fraud governance structure and minimising response time to frauds,” said Das. The earlier three cohorts were for retail payments, cross border payments and MSME lending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digital-payments-for-biz-get-a-boost/articleshow/86879299.cms||---

Kumar was also awarded three-year rigorous imprisonment for concealing evidences and slapped a fine Rs 3,000. Upon non-payment of fine, he will have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 more days. Kumar was found guilty of rape under Section 4 of POCSO Act-2012, but he was not punished under the same act as the quantum of punishment under Section 376-D & B was bigger than that of offence committed under Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The special judge, Shashikant Roy, also ordered payment of Rs 10 lakh to the family of the minor girl from the “victim compensation fund” through secretary, District Legal Service Authority, Araria. The grandmother of the 16-year-old girl had registered an FIR against Kumar, accusing him of raping and killing her granddaughter on August 5, 2019. According to the FIR, the girl, student of a government school, had gone missing from a fair. She was found naked and dead in the fair ground. The trial in the case lasted for nine months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/araria-man-gets-death-for-raping-killing-minor-girl/articleshow/86879064.cms||L P Nayak

This translates to nearly 68% of all secretariats in the state administering at least one dose to more than 90% of the people in their precincts. The mass inoculation drive in Andhra Pradesh has been scaled up over the months, from administering just two lakh doses of the vaccine in January to jabbing nearly 1.04 crore people in September. The Union government for the first time allocated more than one crore vaccine doses (1.04 crore) to Andhra Pradesh in September. According to health officials, Andhra Pradesh will receive another 80.1 lakh vaccine doses as its October quota. The allocation will depend on a range of factors such as average consumption, speed of administration and extent of Covid-19 infections in a particular state/Union territory. Andhra Pradesh followed a dynamic mapping model to cover vulnerable priority groups before it recently opened up the vaccination drive for the 18+ age group. Even though the drive was extended to the young cohort just about 45 days ago, the first dose coverage has already crossed the 60% mark. Meanwhile, of the 1.33 crore people targeted in the 45+ age group, the state has administered the vaccine to 1.43 crore people, exceeding the 100% target. First dose inoculations among healthcare workers (99.27%) and frontline staff (99.13%) are inching towards the 100% mark. The overall first dose vaccination coverage in Andhra Pradesh currently stands at about 82%, while nearly 43% of eligible beneficiaries have been fully immunised against the pandemic. Even if about 40 lakh doses are administered to second dose recipients out of October’s 80-lakh dose allocation, the overall first dose coverage would exceed 90% in Andhra Pradesh by the end of October. More than 50% of the state’s adult population will have completed their two shots by then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/over-10k-secretariats-in-ap-achieve-90-vax-coverage/articleshow/86876319.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The deceased was identified as Anand Rao (43). Initially, family members alleged that Rao took his life after cops harassed him in connection with the gang rape of a woman at Paladugu that took place a month ago. Speaking to TOI, Guntur Urban SP Arif Hafeez said the suicide has nothing to do with police harassment and explained that the deceased and several others were called to gather evidence pertaining to the case. “He (Anand Rao) was called for inquiry not as a suspect but because he lived in the neighbouring area where the incident took place. The cause of his suicide is yet to be established,” Hafeez told TOI. But speaking to vernacular media, Rao’s family claimed he was repeatedly harassed by police in the name of investigation. A case has been registered under section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) and the body sent for postmortem. The gang rape took place on Sep 8 when unidentified miscreants attacked a couple heading towards Sattenapalli. Cops are yet to make progress in the investigation and have so far examined various suspects, including 70 workers from a local cold storage unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmer-kills-self-family-blames-cops/articleshow/86876177.cms||---

Builders and real estate firms have till December 31 for audit of accounts and submission of annual statement of accounts for the last financial year. The Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry and CREDAI - Goa had requested Goa RERA to extend the timelines for the completion of audit and submission of annual account statements for 2020-21 due to the “hardship faced by the real estate sector” during the Covid pandemic. “The Goa RERA discussed the said matter in detail and after considering the current and previous pandemic situation, the authority decided to extend the time to complete the audit of accounts and submit the annual statement of accounts in Form-6 till December 31,” deputy town planner with Goa RERA Yugandaraj Redkar said. As per the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, every real estate developer and builder needs to submit the audited accounts within six months after the end of every financial year for every registered project. Builders said that the pandemic had affected the sector and firms faced a big challenge financially as well as the loss of staff. “Due the limited resources available with small and medium sized entities and the present hardships, there is a practical challenge for businesses to complete the necessary accounting and auditing compliances within the existing timelines,” GCCI had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/builders-get-3-months-to-file-audit-reports/articleshow/86879341.cms||---

Locals said the elephants damaged paddy, banana, maize, sugarcane and other horticulture crops in villages of Garugubilli. The wild animals were in search of food and water and crossed the villages, destroying the standing crop. The forest department has been mulling creating an emergency elephant holding facility in Vizianagaram district to mitigate the jumbo menace here and in Srikakulam district, which has been a problem for the past decade. The elephants entered the Andhra Pradesh forest area from Odisha in 2007 and have since been venturing into village habitations in the two districts. The forest department has visited some places to identify suitable land for an emergency holding facility. Meanwhile, farmers alleged that they have got little compensation from the government when compared to the scale of crop loss caused by the wild elephants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/jumbo-menace-returns-to-hamlets-in-vzm-dist/articleshow/86876773.cms||---

However, this year seems to be better compared to previous year with some communities planning to observe tradition during the festival. Like last year, there will not be any cultural events or processions in Vizag city and its surrounding areas during the Dasara festival. Durga Puja is usually celebrated with fa great deal of anfare by the Bengali community in Vizag city. The city is home to over two lakh members of the Bengali community. The Kalimata temple on RK Beach Road is the one well-known places for the gathering of the community during Dasara celebrations. Ever year over 10 community pujas are organised, but this year just four to five Bengali associations are celebrating the festival. “This year we are not conducting any cultural programmes in the evening. However, we will serve ‘bhog’ on some days as was done in 2019 and we will follow strict Covid-19 protocols,” said one of the organisers Biswanath Burman, Bengali Association, Waltair Kalibari. “Even the people offering puja will have to maintain social distancing norms. We will serve ‘bhog’ but social distancing will be maintained and all protocols will be followed,” said organisers of other Kalibaris in the city. “Durga puja was performed in 2019 across Vizag city with pandals and cultural events. But, the virus has spoiled the spirit of the festival. It may take one more year to witness the old style of Dasara festival in Vizag,” said D Raghu, a resident of Vizag city. Vizagites and residents of surrounding districtsplan to visit Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada for Dasara Navaratri celebrations. However, very few are likely to observe Bhavani Deeksha this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-fears-dampen-dasara-celebrations-this-year-too/articleshow/86876914.cms||Nalla.Babu

The court directed the government not to proceed with construction of houses under its ‘Navaratnalu-Pedalandiriki illu’ scheme. While acknowledging the scheme as laudable for giving house sites to 25 lakh families, the court observed it cannot infringe the personal right of any citizen. One Podili Siva Murali and 128 others had moved the high court after they were denied allotment of house sites under the scheme. After a lengthy hearing, Justice M Satyanrayana Murthy set aside certain guidelines issued through various GOs. The allotment of house sites only to women is discriminatory, Justice Murthy observed, adding that there can be widowed men raising children languishing in poverty and poor transgenders, who cannot be deprived of their right to shelter. The court also found fault with guidelines on issuance of conveyance deeds instead of D-form pattas. The government allotted house sites for a nominal Rs 1 and issued deeds with a lock-in period of five years after which, as per the guidelines, the beneficiaries can sell the house site. Noting that this provision will defeat the very purpose of the scheme, the HC directed the government to issue assigned D-form pattas which gives right to hereditary only but not to alienate the property. While observing that there are no laws to recognise the right to adequate housing in India, Justice Murthy said there should be an assessment of the health impacts and growth prospects of children in the houses to be constructed on an extent of one cent land. He directed the government to form an expert committee to study the same and also suggested to enhance the extent of land based on the recommendations of the expert committee. On the question of environmental impacts if group houses are constructed in small areas, the court observed there should be an impact assessment on various factors. The court further asked the government to conduct the study by forming expert committees and also publish the committees’ reports to take public opinion and objections, if any, on the recommendations. The expert committee should consist of members from Central Pollution Control Board, ministry of housing and urban affairs, and ministry of health and family welfare, the court said, while directing the government not to proceed with the construction of houses till the impact assessment study is completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-halts-housing-scheme-calls-for-assessment-by-expert-body/articleshow/86876528.cms||Srikanth Aluri

A new set of directors would take charge of the Air India board once the ownership of the carrier is transferred to Tata Sons by the government. The holding company of the Tata Group would also look to install new leadership in Air India, refinance its expensive debt, renegotiate high-cost vendor contracts and refurbish old aircraft, among other moves. It will further tap the capabilities and insights of other operating companies like TCS and Taj Sats to overhaul Air India’s existing operating model and cost structure. “Did you know that TCS runs the IT systems and applications of most national carriers of other countries except India’s?” asked a Tata Group executive. “Once the deal is concluded, TCS would step in to manage the A to Z of Air India’s IT and digital operations.” This would improve Air India’s efficiency and reduce operational & maintenance costs. TCS is the technology partner for Vistara, a JV between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines. It also manages the IT and digital systems of Singapore Airlines, the world’s second-best carrier. Tata Sons would hire a new CEO for Air India as part of makeover plans for the carrier, said a different person. Additionally, Saurabh Agrawal and his finance team from Tata Sons would have to fix the commercial problems at Air India by refinancing costly debt, reducing lease liabilities and re-establishing vendor contracts. “Chances are high that a foreign national will be selected to lead Air India. Chandra (referring to Tata Sons chairman) knows many airline CEOs and their senior leadership on a one-on-one basis,” said the second person. Before Chandrasekaran became Tata Sons chairman, he was the CEO of TCS, which has an envious airline client roster. Read AlsoReturn of the prodigal son: Air India back in founder Tata fold after 68 yearsThe government on Friday announced Tata Group as the winning bidder for Air India, clearing the way for the cash-strapped Maharaja going back to the founder exactly 68 years after India had nationalised its private airlines in 1953. ​​Tata wholly owned subsidiary Talace Pvt Ltd put an enterpriseIt is unknown who would lead the Air India board but the first person quoted earlier said, if the current pattern is followed where Tata Sons chairman is the chairman of key operating companies, then Chandrasekaran would lead the carrier’s board with Ratan Tata as its chairman emeritus. While Tata Sons would take over Air India’s Rs 15,300-crore debt and certain “identified” current and non-current liabilities, in merger and acquisitions (M&As) the devil is in the details, said an investment banker. When Tata Sons took over VSNL in 2002 from the government, the latter, which had retained some equity in the telecom company until recently, supported it but in the Air India acquisition there is no guarantee from the Centre (like the discontinuation of PSU and Parliament officials to use only Air India for official travel purposes after the change in ownership). This would impact Air India’s business as it would have to compete for this pie. Read AlsoNervous employees are on a wing and a prayerNEW DELHI: Delayed, truncated salaries for years had made Air India employees realise long ago that the government will not keep funding the Maharaja indefinitely and that many of them are staring at an uncertain future. Given the massive Rs 1- lakh-crore financial albatross around its neck, notTata Sons could also leverage its ties with aerospace majors Boeing and Airbus for better deals to replace Air India’s older generation planes with more fuel-efficient ones to better compete with rivals (Tata Advanced Systems undertakes aircraft/aircraft component manufacturing and assembling for both the US and French giants). It could also use Air India’s ground-handling business unit to service not just its two existing carriers, Vistara and AirAsia India, but other airlines too, which would increase its revenues. Besides, the company’s flight catering venture, Taj Sats could be tapped to serve meals to Air India passengers at 30,000 feet. Several operating companies assisted Tata Sons to conduct the due diligence of Air India, like Tata Steel reviewed the labour contracts, and their capabilities will be further utilised after the completion of the acquisition, said another group executive. An industry expert said Tata Sons would also have to tweak the schedules of its four airlines in a way that they would provide feed from domestic flights to fill up the wide bodies going non-stop to international destinations. This scissor operation — people getting off narrow-bodied aircraft and then transferring to long-hauls on wide bodies — for flying people in and out of India is at the moment majorly carried out by Gulf carriers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/group-plans-sea-change-in-ai-to-rope-in-tcs-for-tech-thrust/articleshow/86879440.cms||Reeba Zachariah

It will have to allocate more resources to sustain aviation even as it makes ambitious moves in digital, hi-tech manufacturing and healthcare sectors. Though the company’s traditional businesses do not need capital, except for a few, its balance sheet is set to increasingly reflect investments in emerging businesses as it looks to capitalise on growth opportunities and aims to make at least one of them a cash-spewing machine like TCS. The software services major, which was spun off as a separate entity in fiscal 2005, contributes the highest (over 85%) to Tata Sons’s income. Money will, however, not be a problem with Tata Sons to finance acquisitions and invest in businesses as it enjoys the current steel upcycle, consistent performance of TCS and impressive market capitalisation growth of its operating companies. The market value of its investments is over Rs 12 lakh crore as against its debt of Rs 25,396 crore, placing Tata Sons in a comfortable position. This also allows it to raise capital by monetising its investments, something it has been doing whenever required. “Telecom (Tata Teleservices) has been a thorn in Tata Sons’s bouquet for some years, but that’s been dealt with. Shareholdings have been raised in existing businesses (like Tata Communications and Tata Chemicals) and Tata Sons is in a comfortable position now. Besides, growth capital has been infused in units (like Tata Power and Tata Motors) to deleverage their balance sheets. It will not be a problem to push in more funds into aviation and other new businesses to support and accelerate their growth,” said a person familiar with Tata Sons’s moves. Recently, the holding company of the Tata Group has spent considerable amounts to buy BigBasket, 1MG and Tejas Networks, among others, and plans to spend more to outfight competition. Some trackers of Tata Sons, however, have reservations and feel that aviation, known to be a capital-guzzling and money-losing venture, could pull the salt-to-software conglomerate down. Internally, Bombay House, Tata Group’s headquarters in Mumbai, has estimated that the business will not make profit for five years till 2025, when global passenger traffic is expected to return to pre-Covid level. Tata Sons’s existing airline startups — AirAsia India and Vistara, in which it has invested more than Rs 6,000 crore since commencement of operations — have lost over Rs 9,000 crore till date. The aviation business has been hurt by high operational costs and bribery scandals at AirAsia India, among other factors. Air India’s back story too is not in Tata Sons’s favour — the carrier has not been profitable for the last 14 years. While Tata Sons may not put expansion capital into AirAsia India as its Malaysian partner is already in a detachment mode from the low-cost carrier, it will be deploying additional funds into full-service player Vistara, which has Singapore Airlines as a promoter. It may also have to shell out money equivalent to its Air India bid to restructure the carrier, which will be the second-biggest purchase under Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran after Bhushan Steel. But, an industry person pointed out, “A lean cost structure is the key to script a success in aviation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/high-on-e-play-tatas-need-to-refuel-aviation-business/articleshow/86879633.cms||Reeba Zachariah

A new eight-storey building is being built at an estimated expenditure of Rs 39.14 crore on the premises of the old Anjuman Islamia Hall on Ashok Rajpath. Chairing a meeting to review the functioning of the minority welfare department, Nitish said, “Anjuman Islamia Hall is a historic building with which I have a special attachment. Once the new building is ready, it will be a source of income for the Waqf Board.” Earlier, Nitish had laid the foundation for the construction of a new building on the premises of the old Anjuman Islamia Hall on October 15, 2018. The CM also asked the officials to ensure the construction of a multi-purpose building of the Waqf Board in all the 38 districts of the state so that “people belonging to minority communities can use them for different purposes”. While reviewing the welfare schemes of the department, Nitish directed the officials to provide loans to the minorities under the Mukhyamantri Alpsankhyak Rozgar Yojana. He also asked them to expedite the construction of school buildings across the state and adopt different components of the ‘Unnayan Bihar’ model to provide better education to children. Earlier, the secretary of the minority welfare department, Safeena A N, made a detailed presentation before the CM about the implementation of different schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-complete-construction-of-anjuman-islamia-hall-by-feb-next-year/articleshow/86876933.cms||Madan Kumar

Launching the ‘Swachhangini’ at an event jointly organised by the Patna Municipal Corporation and the UNFPA-Bihar, the deputy CM said the group which will run as an independent body would clean the drains and septic tanks in the city in a mechanised manner. “The initiative would help in mobilising women to become their own leader as well as generate the means of earning for their livelihood in a socially and economically-empowered and dignified way,” he said. Prasad handed over the keys of five jetting machines to the representatives of each group of women sanitation workers of the slum areas of Patna. The jetting machines were procured by the PMC under the Centre’s National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation scheme. The deputy CM praised the PMC and the UNFPA for development of slums and capacity building of scavengers. He also appreciated the work done by the PMC during the peak of Covid-19. “The Centre and the state government are working with commitment for the development of urban areas, especially for the uplift of women,” Prasad said, adding many urban areas have been upgraded and new urban bodies formed in the state. As a result, urban population has increased in the state, he added. Road construction minister Nitin Nabin said the enthusiastic participation of women in such work would bring a change in the society. Patna Mayor Sita Sahu said, “As mayor, I want that women should be provided employment opportunities with respect. We cannot imagine the growth of Patna without the development of sanitation workers and their families,” she said. Municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma said special emphasis was being laid on the cleanliness through mechanised way in the city. UNFPA-Bihar’s state coordinator Mohd Nadeem Noor said this small effort would prove to be a big initiative in future. Kumhrar MLA Arun Kumar Sinha, deputy mayor Rajni Devi and other officials of the PMC were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-women-workers-to-clean-patna-in-a-mechanised-way/articleshow/86879127.cms||Faryal Rumi

The chief minister reviewed agri-infra projects with officials at his Tadepalli camp office on Friday. The chief minister told officials to strengthen rythu bharosa kendras (RBKs) and make them contact points for farmers. The RBKs should supply seeds, fertilizers, mechanised tools and marketing facility to farmers, ensuring greater benefit to them, he said. Officials told the chief minister that RBKs will act as sub-dealers from the next rabi season. The chief minister instructed officials to set up community hiring centres at locations where paddy is being cultivated. The chief minister instructed officials to encourage farmers to cultivate alternative crops such as millets instead of paddy in areas under borewell irrigation. He also told them to provide incentives to farmers who cultivate alternate crops. He further told them to establish agriculture processing centres wherever required. Officials informed the chief minister that seed-cum-millet processing units will come up at 33 places in the state, of which 20 units will be ready by this December. The other 13 will be ready by March 2022. Officials informed the chief minister about the progress of works on food processing units. Officials also told the chief minister that works related to fishing harbours in Juvvaladinne, Nizampatnam, Machilipatnam and Uppada are in progress and will be completed by July. On milk collection, the chief minister told the officials to coordinate with Amul and ensure that the farmers are paid better price for milk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ensure-remunerative-prices-to-farmers/articleshow/86876474.cms||Gopi Dara

Aviation activists now hope that south Gujarat and the city will now get much-wanted enhanced air connectivity as the city had to campaign for several years to get basic flights unlike other cities of state.  Navsari being 30 km away from the city, the stakeholders for growth of the city’s aviation sector will now be strongly presenting their case for better connectivity with support of Air India. “Not only Parsis but all over India, people are happy. Now Tatas will bring back the airline’s glory. Surat has potential for international connectivity,” said Kersi Deboo, a Navsari resident and former director of Gujarat Minorities Development Corporation.  Trustee of The World Zorastrian Organisation Trust Funds, Cyrus Vandriwala said, “JRD Tata used to come to Navsari by flight and I hope that the Tata Group contributes in the development of this region as well.” “The whole country will benefit with Tata taking over Air India, not only Gujarat,” said Marzban Giara, a historian from Navsari.  City’s aviation activist Sanjay Jain said, “Tata Group will see the potential of the city due to its thriving diamond and textile industry.”  Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) will lobby for international air connectivity from Air India. “We can now capitalize on the connection between Navsari and Tatas. We will aggressively demand connectivity to Dubai first,” said Ashish Gujarati, president of SGCCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/aviation-activists-upbeat-about-ai-sale/articleshow/86877307.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Business||Three flights up, merger on cards?||Reeba.Zachariah@timesgroup.com Long before Tata Sons even evinced interest in Air India, chairman N Chandrasekaran had sketched a blueprint for the aviation business. He told TOI in 2019 that he would not run a third airline in addition to Vistara and AirAsia India, unless they merged. Which means that an amalgamation of Tata Sons’s aviation interests, on the lines of consolidation initiated by Chandrasekaran in other segments like food and defence, is on the cards. But a person familiar with Tata Sons’s thinking said that the integration of multiple aviation units will be possible only after the chairman spruces up the business. “Air India comes with complexities — the onerous contracts, huge workforce & their employment agreements containing certain benefits and perks higher than industry standards, etc. Several issues need to be handled with care before consolidation moves,” said the person. Moreover, the Air India acquisition comes with a provision restricting the new owner from transferring its shares directly or indirectly to any person for one year from the date of closing the transaction. A merger is, however, allowed provided the new owner holds more than 51% in the carrier during the one-year lock-in period. It will also have to issue 3% of Air India’s shares to employees according to the terms of the deal. Air India has well-served one of Tata Sons’s reasons for bidding, as the transaction catapults the company to the position of the largest player from India on international routes and the second-largest on domestic routes. Tata Sons threw its hat into the Air India bidding ring because it had been looking for a solution for its sub-scale aviation business. In the same 2019 interview, Chandrasekaran said he wanted to scale up the company’s aviation business and needed “to find a solution” for it. Since then, the dynamics at Tata Sons’s aviation business have changed. It had bought Malaysian partner’s 33% share in AirAsia India, increasing its holdings to 84%. Tata Sons now has the option to buy AirAsia’s remaining 16% in the low-cost carrier by next year. Once the share-purchase happens and the brand-licensing agreement with AirAsia ends, the company will be offering a “white-label service”, which could then be combined with Air India or Vistara, said a different person. The Air India acquisition has, however, put the spotlight on Vistara and its co-promoter Singapore Airlines. While Vistara was initially evaluating Air India, Singapore Airlines got cold feet as the pandemic strained its resources. Singapore was also concerned about the investment Air India would entail and the risks that would follow the acquisition. Also, there was a conflict as Vistara, Singapore Airlines and Air India have competing full-service business models on certain domestic and international routes. The acquisition comes with a clause that Tata Sons will have to retain the Air India brand for a period of five years. Nonetheless, Singapore Airlines cancelled the non-compete clause in Vistara’s contract, allowing Tata Sons to participate in the Air India auction. But the island city-state is unsure of consolidation at this moment and is in a wait-and-watch mode. “Singapore would like to wait and see how Tata Sons’s aviation business pans out. It could then decide whether to be part of its consolidation story,” said a third source. At the moment, it is not known what Tata Sons’s brand architecture plan is for the aviation business. It will have five brands — Air India, Air India Express, Indian Airlines, AirAsia India and Vistara — in its portfolio after the Air India acquisition. Consulting firm Arthur D Little’s managing partner Thomas Kuruvilla feels the company could have multiple brands for different segments. “Tata Sons could play a well-known airline practice used in other parts of the world — mainly Europe and Asia-Pacific — by deploying different products under multiple brands for different market segments. India is a huge market with a differentiated demand structure — from domestic volume markets to premium leisure and business long-haul routes to labour markets and to religious traffic. Tata Sons could surely reduce costs and investments by optimising its networks, fleets, landing & parking slots, and ground services, among other things,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/three-flights-up-merger-on-cards/articleshow/86879438.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Business||RBI charts plan to cut surplus liquidity by over Rs 5L cr by Dec||Mumbai: RBI has drawn a roadmap to reduce surplus liquidity by over Rs 5 lakh crore by December 2021 even as the monetary policy committee has chosen to maintain a status quo on rates and its accommodative stance as well as growth projections. This could be as good as it gets for borrowers as the withdrawal of liquidity will put pressure on bond yields, which could eventually get passed on to loans as well. Announcing the liquidity normalisation roadmap, governor Shaktikanta Das said currently surplus liquidity is at an average of Rs 9.5 lakh crore in October so far and the potential liquidity overhang amounts to more than Rs 13 lakh crore. RBI plans to bring down the surplus liquidity so that its borrowings from banks under the reverse repo operation would come down to Rs 2-3 lakh crore by December 2021. It is currently around Rs 8.8 lakh crore. “We do not want suddenness. We do not want surprises. We do not want to rock the boat, more so, because we have to reach the shore, which is now visible and there is a journey beyond the shore,” Das said in his post-policy address, explaining the rationale behind not reducing liquidity. He said RBI would work toward its 4% inflation goal by going forward in a calibrated manner and without creating disruption. Das once again flagged concerns on inflationary impact of high indirect taxes on fuel and said it was for the government to take a decision on the issue. “The gradual and calibrated unwinding of liquidity measures will support growth, while keeping inflation under control,” said CH SS Mallikarjuna Rao, MD & CEO, PNB. The monetary policy committee voted 5:1 in favour of maintaining the status quo on the repo rate at 4%. RBI also decided to maintain the reverse repo rate at 3.35%. Economists saw the governor being circumspect about growth from his policy statements, although all growth targets were retained. “We are looking at the growth signs to become entrenched and show signs of durability. We are closely watchful of the evolving dynamics,” said Das. For the current financial year, RBI on Friday retained its projection for real GDP growth at 9.5%. The RBI however lowered its FY22 retail inflation projection to 5.3% from 5.7%, saying the inflation trajectory has turned out to be more favourable than expected. He re-assured markets that liquidity will be available for growth and the absorption will be through reverse repo where participation is voluntary. He, however, indicated that there was no further need for government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) through which RBI bought back bonds. In the current fiscal, RBI has injected Rs 2.4 lakh crore through bond buybacks including G-SAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-charts-plan-to-cut-surplus-liquidity-by-over-rs-5l-cr-by-dec/articleshow/86879615.cms||---

The bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya dismissed the appeal petition filed by the Guntur district collector seeking to vacate the stay on the election. Shaik Jabeen, who was elected MPTC from Chiluvuru-1, moved the court seeking directions to stay the MPP election till her appeal for caste certificate was decided by the district collector. She filed an appeal challenging the proceedings of the tehsildar, who rejected her application seeking BC-E caste certificate. The court had earlier stayed the election and directed Guntur collector to resolve the issue within one week. Challenging the order, the district collector, panchayat raj principal secretary and D Santosa Rupavani, another MPTC, moved appeal petitions. Government pleader Khadar Mastan urged the bench to vacate the stay on the MPP election as it will take a month for the district administration to take a decision on Jabeen’s appeal, and also as the election process is already set in motion. He also sought more time from the court. The court declined his request, observing that they are not inclined to intervene with the single judge order.

The model road will be developed with facilities for paid parking system, demarcated ‘no parking’ and ‘parking’ zones, prevention of obstructive parking and a smooth vehicular flow. The new road will mainly address the issue of the road stretches that are chock-a-block with traffic, partly owing to the haphazard parking of vehicles along roads. “Parking and walking space for pedestrians are the major issues faced by citizens in our city. There is hardly any space for people to walk on footpaths that are either too narrow or too high. Most of them are completely encroached upon by the public toilets and loo cafes set up by GHMC. A model road will be a good concept if these mistakes are not repeated,” said G Subash Chandra, a civil engineer. As per the officials, the model road concept is seen as a viable option for implementation in the long run while considering the space constraints of the city which does not have sufficient parking lots or footpaths as per the Indian Road Congress guidelines. On the other hand, to ensure smooth flow of traffic, the GHMC is also going to begin construction of about four flyovers near Uppal junction, as part of the SRDP. The flyovers are being constructed in view of the four-lane 6.25km long elevated corridor which is coming up from Narapally up to Uppal junction. However, when asked about the slow pace of works of the elevated corridor, Saroja Rani, chief engineer (projects), GHMC said, “Land acquisition for the Uppal elevated corridor is still in progress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/model-road-to-make-city-more-walkable/articleshow/86879198.cms||Moulika.KV

I told him that if he had to be in my place, Goans would not have even got water. Now he wants to start ‘Rath’ yatra. This is nothing but selfish politics,” he said. Without naming TMC, panchayat minister and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho said, “There are such parties coming to Goa to contest the upcoming polls, whose culture is stabbing and killing for political gain. Our workers have to ask the people of Goa whenever they go for campaigning whether they want such parties to come down to Goa who have violence as their culture."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-hits-out-at-oppn-for-criticism/articleshow/86879287.cms||---

To begin with, selected specialities such as medicine, general surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, orthopaedics, eye, ENT and urology will be open. OPD registration timings will be from 8am to 11.30am, the hospital said. “Emergency lab services will be available for patients requiring urgent investigation in the new emergency block. Pharmacy services will also be available in the OPD building,” the hospital said. The hospital had decided to open the OPD on Sundays for the elderly in 2019. Soon after that, the pandemic struck, and the services got hampered. The new decision is another attempt by the central government to improve health services in the city and address the issue of overcrowding in hospitals. “For months, many people with chronic illnesses avoided visiting hospitals because the pandemic was at its peak.Now that the pandemic situation has improved, people are rushing to get checked. Also, there is a significant surge in cases of febrile illness, which is contributing to increased footfall and the extended OPD timing may help in addressing that,” said a senior doctor. Nearly 8,000 patients visit Safdarjung hospital daily. In a related development, the free drug distribution pharmacy shop of AIIMS will now be open on all holidays and Sundays from 9am to 4pm. The free generic pharmacy shop is managed by HLL Lifecare Limited, a PSU under the ministry of health and family welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safdarjung-hosp-opd-to-open-on-sundays-too/articleshow/86879093.cms||---

BJP’s Eatala Rajender, TRS party’s Gellu Srinivas Yadav and Balmoori Venkat of Congress are the three main contenders in the October 30 bypolls. Several independent candidates staged a protest in front of the office of the returning officer alleging that they were denied their democratic right to enter the electoral fray. They also wrote a letter to the chief electoral officer explaining how police and polling officials saw to it that they could not file their nominations.  As many as 1,000 field assistants had planned to contest the polls as they were removed from their jobs in the MGNREGS. One of the conditions that was put to the independents was that they should produce a certificate stating that they had taken two doses of vaccine in addition to showing the two doses inoculation certificate of 10 proposers, who also should be physically present at the time of filing of the nomination. “These rules violate the democratic right,” Raju, K Sayanna and B Ravi Teja, who sought to contest as independent. From the time the nomination process began on October 1, independents said they had been facing obstacles.

---||Delhi||Delhi: IIT undergraduate says started stalking spree after being spurned by girl||NEW DELHI: The 19-year-old engineering student arrested on Thursday for allegedly stalking minors and teachers of a school in north Delhi has told police that his misadventures started with him wanting to get back at a girl of the school who had stopped speaking to him. Mahavir, the accused BTech student of IIT-Kharagpur, befriended the minor girl on social media, but the 17-year-old later told him that she wanted to focus on her studies and did not want to waste time in conversations with him. Mahavir began his vengeful capers by changing his identity and making friends with the girl’s pals.  He later began morphing their pictures into nude photos. “His initial interrogation paints him as a voyeur,” said a police officer. “In the 2-3 years of doing this, he hasn’t derived any monetary benefits. He only tried to barge into groups, interact with the women and girls and morph their pictures to make them look explicit in order to blackmail other girls and get them to give him the phone numbers of more girls.” The girl told the cops that the accused had become friends on a social media platform under a different name. The officer said, “Later, with her exams approaching, she stopped talking to Mahavir. Sometime later, she learnt that the accused had befriended two of her friends, telling them that he knew her well. During their conversations, the girl must have sent him some pictures that he now used to gain the trust of her friends. Mahavir then sent explicit pictures of the teenager that he had morphed to her and blackmailed her.” The IIT student later started threatening the 17-year-old and asked her to share the online class links. The girl’s family intervened to resolve the issue, but the accused only worsened the situation, creating fake Instagram accounts and posting the morphed pictures of the girl there along with her phone numbers. Mahavir had similarly threatened many girls and managed to get the class links, according to the cops. He would note their names on the screen and later look them up on social media and then send friend requests to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-undergrad-says-started-stalking-spree-after-being-spurned-by-girl/articleshow/86879289.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NHAI plans to complete 3 Pardi flyovers by January||Nagpur: After overcoming all the hiccups, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has set January 2022 as the fresh deadline to open the first phase of three flyovers on the crucial Pardi stretch. The overall project with five flyovers of 6km length will be commissioned by June 2022 benefiting 55,000 passenger car units (PCUs). Sanctioned cost of the project is Rs650 crore, including civil cost of Rs448.28 crore. The work has been awarded to a joint venture of GDCL-SMS. The stone for the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 21, 2014. On Friday during a site visit, the NHAI showcased how the project was being expedited after clearing all the hurdles, barring one patch of 86-metre near Rani Parjapati Square junction where a dispute has arisen with a beer bar owner. It is being resolved through the high court. Explaining the nitty-gritty of the unique project, NHAI regional officer Rajeev Agrawal said, “The mega project is claimed to be the first ‘open to sky’ project in Maharashtra and perhaps in the country. The project was to be commissioned by March 2019.” On the delay, Agrawal said, “There were several reasons. One of them was handing over of 1.18-hectare land needed for the project by NMC/NIT and the state government, and the approval of general arrangement drawings (GAD) from Metro, which finalized GADs in June 2018, and the land was handed over by various agencies in September 2020, excluding 86sqmt at Rani Prajapati Square.” Project director NL Yeotkar said, “The civil works could be possible only after a ban on movement of heavy vehicles for four months on the said stretch. Earlier, it was carried out without stoppage of traffic. Therefore, the project could not take up full pace. Now, traffic diversion permission has been accorded.” Agrawal said, “Also, the project is being constructed in heavily congested city area and there are too many underground utilities like water pipelines, live electrical and telephone cables, and sewage lines. These utilities were too old and their drawings were also not available with NMC due to which several difficulties were encountered during the construction.” This hampered the progress of the project and at times, designs had to be changed to avoid such utilities. Finally, all utilities have been shifted in May 2021. A visit to the sites found that 65% of work on the project has been completed and the remaining work is in full swing. Talking about the project, East Nagpur MLA Krishna Khopde said, “In the last year, the project has picked up speed. Of the total length of the flyovers, till last year only about 0.8km was complete, but now 3km length has been completed.” Earlier, over the years, concrete roads of 3.5km were done but in the last year, work on 7.5km has been completed. Work of HB Town junction has been going on in full swing and foundation work has almost been completed and column and superstructure work is under progress for which of the 24 girders, 16 girders have been cast. “Work of RUB has been taken up. Besides, foundation work at Nag River bridge has been completed and the pile cap is in progress. Till today, we have spent Rs265 crore on the project. We plan to open flyovers from Pardi Naka to HB Town to Kalamna and Itwari in January 2022, and the balance project is targeted to be complete in June 2022,” said Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nhai-plans-to-complete-3-pardi-flyovers-by-january/articleshow/86879680.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

BEST on Friday floated tenders to procure the buses on wet lease along with drivers. Commuters and transport experts have been demanding that Mumbai’s iconic double deckers, whose fleet fell from 120 to 48, be saved. The new double-deckers may have single/double stairs, depending on bids received. The battery and few components will have to be imported by Indian manufacturer, officials said, adding that the first lot of 50 could arrive early next year, followed by 50 more and 100 in the third phase. BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said it will cost Rs68-70 lakh to purchase a normal double-decker bus in Mumbai; an electric variant would mean an increase in cost of 150%, which is over Rs 1.7 crore per bus. Chandra said it was feasible to go for the wet lease model, where a private contractor provides the bus with driver, fuel and ensures maintenance and upkeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-floats-tenders-for-200-ac-electric-double-deckers/articleshow/86879704.cms||Somit Sen

The theme of the three-hour-long summit was ‘India@75: Accelerating the growth of the Indian helicopter industry and increasing air connectivity.’ During the event, Scindia announced that helicopter operators will be exempted from paying parking deposits and landing charges as part of the new heli-policy. Simultaneously, the beta version of Heli Seva portal was launched on the website of the Union ministry of civil aviation as a single-window solution to facilitate all permissions for helicopter operations. A booklet, titled “Heli Disha”, was also released for the guidance of civil helicopter operation at the event. “Heli Disha will be given to every district collector. It will comprise all rules and regulations regarding helicopter operations. This will ensure ease of operation at all levels,” the minister said. During the summit, he said that there were plans to set up a Helicopter Accelerator Cell in the Union ministry of civil aviation. Also, regulatory and policy direction will be provided to ensure ease of doing business for the helicopter industry. Elaborating on the plans of the department to expand heli services in the country, Scindia said, “We will build four heli-hubs in the country, starting from Juhu, Guwahati, Delhi and Bengaluru. We have identified 10 cities and 82 routes to develop as helicopter corridors across the country. To give a boost to helicopter emergency services in India, heliports will be developed alongside three expressways – Delhi-Mumbai, Ambala-Kotputli, and Ambala-Bhatinda-Jamnagar.” He added that helicopters contribute to providing every small and big facility to various difficult areas. “We have emphasised on increasing the number of helicopters in India so that more and more people can avail the benefits,” said the minister. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said helicopters play an important role in promoting tourism in the state. He added, “Our government is working on improving heli services in the state to help people avail of the benefits.” During the event, Union minister of state, VK Singh, said that role of helicopters is even more crucial in the Himalayan region. He added, “Air ambulances, air taxis, and helicopters play a pivotal role in disasters.

---||Delhi||Delhi: New bus depots charged up to welcome first fleet of electric buses||NEW DELHI: With the first fleet of electric buses set to arrive soon, new depots that will house these state-of-the-art vehicles are also nearly ready. On March 26, the Delhi cabinet had approved the engagement of 300 low-floor electric air-conditioned buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC).  While 118 buses were to arrive in October, 100 were slated to come in November and 60 in December. The remaining 20 buses were scheduled to arrive by January 2022. The second Covid-19 wave, however, affected the delivery of electric buses and creation of infrastructure, such as charging stations at designated bus depots, by more than a month. The rollout is now expected to start soon and designated bus depots are being made at Rohini-I and II, Mundela Kalan, Subhash Place, Mayapuri, Rajghat-II, Hari Nagar, Sukhdev Vihar, among other places. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, said two bus depots at Rohini were nearly ready and the one at Mundela Kalan was 90% ready and power connectivity had already been provided. “The depots have been created with a butterfly pattern. The buses will be parked in bays on the periphery and the charging infrastructure will be on a raised slab at the centre. The charging guns will be put in the buses just like fuel pumps,” added Kundra. The 300 buses would be run and maintained by operators, who would be paid per kilometre under the “Operating Expenses” model. They would maintain the buses and provide the drivers, while DTC would depute conductors and bear the cost of electricity consumption. “The depots will be handed over to the operator, who will bring the other paraphernalia,” Kundra said. Delhi government also plans to induct 1,000 e-buses under the Cluster Scheme. The DTC board approved the induction of 1,015 electric and 230 CNG buses in fiscal 2021-22 in a meeting chaired by transport minister Kailash Gahlot.  Eventually, all CNG buses would be replaced with electric ones as part of a shift towards cleaner fuel. Currently, DTC has a fleet of 3,762 buses, out of which 2,644 were procured between 2007 and 2010 and are nearing “end of life”. To tide over the shortage and cater to Delhi’s public transport needs, DTC had to request the state transport authority to allow its buses to run for 15 years from the date of registration. Delhi needed at least 11,000 buses even before the Covid-induced social distancing slashed the carrying capacity.  The combined fleet of DTC and Cluster Scheme is about 6,000. While 3,000 more buses were planned to be inducted, Covid-19 put a spanner in the works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-bus-depots-charged-up-to-welcome-first-fleet-of-e-buses/articleshow/86879322.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The member secretary of TNSLA who appeared before the court, submitted a report on Friday. In his report, he stated that there are a total of 3,538 convict prisoners in central, open air and special prisons for women across the state.

Such details are also being collected. Taking cognizance of the report, a division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu directed the TNSLA to inquire as to whether the 552 prisoners are willing to file an appeal. The judges also directed the TNSLA to collect details with respect to appeals filed by convict prisoners who did not know about their appeal particulars. The judges sought a report in this regard and adjourned the case. The court was hearing the criminal appeal filed by S Pathipoornam of Tirunelveli district in 2018 challenging the conviction and life sentence imposed by the Tirunelveli II additional sessions court on November 20, 1996. During the earlier hearing, the legal aid counsel R Alagumani for the appellant submitted that many convict prisoners are languishing in jail for want of proper legal aid to file appeals against conviction. The court had directed the member secretary of TNSLA to instruct secretaries of all the district legal services authority to visit concerned prisons and collect particulars regarding the convict prisoners who have not filed any appeals against their convictions so far either before the high court or Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/552-of-3538-convict-prisoners-have-not-filed-appeals-tnsla/articleshow/86879330.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Businessman claimed he’s a ‘farmer’ to buy Nashik land on forged documents||MUMBAI: Businessman Sanjay Punamia who had been arrested in connection with two extortion cases involving former police commissioner Param Bir Singh has now been booked in a cheating and forgery case by Nashik police for purchasing agricultural land by submitting forged documents to show him as an ‘agriculturist’. An FIR of cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust has been registered at Sinnar police station in Nashik. Officials said that the fresh case was registered by second registrar of Sinnar, Pramod Waman. In the complaint Waman has alleged that during a course of routine check, it transpired that Sanjay Mishrimal Punumiya had in 2007 submitted documents, including 7/ 12 extract, claiming that he is a ‘farmer’ and purchased property from Kailas Muktasa Kshetriya. “The complainant said that during examination of documents, it transpired that this property was in the name of Babulal Agarwal, Satyanarayan and Ram Agarwal, but Punamia has forged documents and added his name to it on Uttan’s property in Thane and later the Uttan’s documents have been used to purchase agriculture land in Dharangaon and later in Mirgaon in Nashik. It appears to have added false evidence that he was a ‘farmer’ at the time. ‘’ said an officer. In July, two offences, one at Marine Drive police station and another at Kopri police station were registered against Punamia, Jain Param Bir Singh, DCP Manere and DCP Akbar Pathan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bizman-claimed-hes-a-farmer-to-buy-nashik-land-on-forged-docus/articleshow/86879556.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||First charter may reach Goa by mid-November||Panaji: The first charter of the season may land in Goa by mid-November even as the Centre will start issuing visas from October 15. The operators are looking at November since all activities such as finalisation of landing schedules and marketing have normally to be done a month or two preceding the start of the tourist season. “The process has just begun. Aircraft need to obtain landing permissions, secondly, tour companies will have to start marketing the destination. Once that starts, we will know how many tourists are likely to come. Technically, things have started moving. I expect Goa to start receiving charters by mid-November,” said Nilesh Shah, president of the travel and tourism association of Goa (TTAG). With the Centre finally lifting the ban on international commercial flights, all those activities will start now, and operators are optimistic about the good season, Shah said. Abida Kumar, vice-president (operations) at Minar Travels, said that it can’t be said when their first charter of the season will arrive, as the schedules have not been out though they applied a month ago. “Normally, by August we used to get our full schedule. With visas to be issued from October 15, I expect the first charter of the season should land in Goa by mid-November,” said Kumar. Melroy D’Costa, station manager, however, said that it would be too early to give a date as to when charters would start arriving, as the announcement was just made a day ago. The next big task, D’Costa said, would be the protocol that tourists would be required to follow in India. “Once we have a clear picture about the protocol, we can send it to tour operators. Then the sale of tickets would start. We are already running short on time. Normally, the preparation time is of two months. I think we will have the first flight by November 17,” D’Costa said. Shah said that though the charter season is likely to take off a month late, the feedback from operators so far has been positive, and tourists are keen to visit Goa. Normally, Goa receives its first charter of the season by the third week of October. Operators are also happy about the latest announcement by the UK government. After it had declared that it recognises Covishied but not the vaccine certificate issued in India, and made it mandatory for Indians fully vaccinated with Covishield arriving in the UK after October 4 to undergo 10-day quarantine, the Indian government retaliated with similar curbs. With the UK doing away with the restrictions towards fully-vaccinated Indian travellers, India too is expected to loosen entry restrictions for people travelling to India from the UK. “It is a good sign that the UK has lifted entry restrictions for fully-vaccinated Indian travellers. It will help boost international travel and tourism. Good thing is that the issue has been sorted out before the tourist season started,” Shah said. Goa receives a sizable number of tourists from the UK, and tour operators were worried that the ten-day mandatory quarantine will keep away the UK holiday crowd from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/first-charter-may-reach-goa-by-mid-nov/articleshow/86879444.cms||Bindiya Chari

Water from a natural source that’s under the idol of Chintamani has started moving upwards and coming out in the shrine. In the last 24 hours, almost three feet of this shrine, which is situated 30 feet below the ground level, is filled with this water. Residents claim that this phenomenon used to earlier happen every 12 years. The water level rises till the Chintamani idol and then gradually goes down. “Water continues to rise for 20 days, and later recedes in seven days.” said an 89-year-old local resident. “Residents of Kalamb and devotees of Lord Ganesha believe that the water is the River Ganga that appears every 12 years to touch the feet of lord Chintamani and disappears later,” said Chandu Chandore, president of the Chintamani temple trust. “We have been watching this since childhood. It generally happens in the month of Ashwin after every 12 years. However, it did not happen since 1995. We were wondering why it discontinued,” he added. According to Shailesh Kale, SDO of Kalamb, this is a natural phenomenon well mentioned in the district gazettes right from the British era. “Once in 12 years, in the Hindu month of Ashwin (Sept-Oct), water from the Ganesh Kund in the temple begins to rise and partially submerges the 4.5-ft idol. This calls for a grand pilgrimage. But looking at the Covid conditions, we have restricted the entry inside the temple,” said Kale. He also informed that the Yavatmal district administration has already informed the Geological Survey of India (Central Region) Nagpur and a team of experts will visit Kalamb soon to find out the reason behind the phenomenon. Dr Yogesh Murkute from the Geology department of RTMNU, who is an expert of Hydrogeology, said that this natural phenomenon is well-known in geology. “An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock. There are of different types of aquifers. One of them is the Confined aquifer. The catchment areas of these rocks could be hundreds of kilometres away. It may take years for these rocks to recharge with rainwater. Once recharged fully, water starts coming out from one end of such rocks,” he said. Dr Murkute recalled similar incidents in Yeola Tehsil of Nashik district where the catchment area of the aquifer was found 190km away from the source. “We need further study of this source too. This may give us astonishing results,” he added. Piezometric Surface is also a known phenomenon in geology. A senior scientist at the groundwater survey and development Agency (GSDA) Nagpur told TOI that once filled to capacity, water starts releasing with pressure up to some level for some period. “It’s due to the pressure of water between rocks and surfaces. As we are already fetching large quantity of groundwater these days, this exercise may have got delayed by 12 years to 26 years,” the scientist said. Prof DB Malpe, an expert in economic geology, said that this is the best time to find out the source. “A GSI team of experts will soon find the scientific reason behind the phenomenon. The recharging zone of this outlet could be miles away,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ancient-ganesha-shrine-in-yavatmal-goes-under-water-after-26-years/articleshow/86879675.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Asking the secretary to conduct a probe in an impartial manner, a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar directed him to submit the report within four months. While issuing contempt notice to Kumre under Rule 9(1) of the Contempt of Court (Bombay High Court) Rules, 1994, the bench asked commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar to appoint an officer not below the rank of deputy commissioner to investigate the affairs of granting benefit of parole and furlough to ineligible prisoners and refusing same benefits to eligible ones. “The officer appointed by the CP should independently investigate all these issues without taking help of SP. The deputy inspector general (prison) East Region shall extend all cooperation to him. He shall submit his report within eight weeks from today to this court.” The stern directives came after jail authorities refused parole to petitioner Hanuman Pendam claiming he had jumped parole in January. The HC had then appointed Firdos Mirza as amicus curiae to study the case. The petitioner contended that he returned on stipulated date, but was told to bring Covid-19 RTPCR certificate. He visited GMCH and IGGMCH twice but couldn’t get tested due to the huge rush. He said he can’t afford to take tests at private facilities as it costs about Rs700. In an earlier hearing, HC had told SP to provide complete details of all prisoners released on parole on regular basis as well as on emergency basis after Covid-19 pandemic struck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-orders-dept-probe-against-jail-sp-for-misuse-of-power/articleshow/86875994.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||Delhi: As RTOs go online, officials get makeover too||NEW DELHI: With almost all transport services going completely online as part of Delhi government’s ‘faceless’ services, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) and the Motor Licensing Officers (MLO) are on the way to becoming relics of the past. Delhi government has now redesignated MLOs as District Transport Officers (DTOs), and as district-level field officers, their role now far surpasses the traditional duties of issuing licences and registrations to being responsible for tackling vehicular pollution, ensuring road safety, enforcement, etc. in their respective districts. Delhi government said in a statement that the MLOs in Delhi have now been given district-level officer status as DTOs and will now be authorised to perform all transport-related duties at the district level. Although the first ‘faceless’ services began in February this year, the government’s transport department proposed the redesignation of MLOs after most of the department’s services and transactions went completely online in August. “I congratulate all the rechristened DTOs and senior officials of the transport department for making this happen. All our (then) MLOs have been instrumental in public service delivery of the transport department and had stepped up to the huge change in their duties when we launched faceless services, even working extra hours,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot said in a statement. “This is a huge responsibility that is being bestowed upon the entire cadre of MLOs and MVIs (Motor Vehicle Inspectors) and I’m confident that they will set an example for the entire department,” he said. As per the approved order, although the erstwhile MLOs would now be called as DTOs, their pay scale and other conditions of service would remain the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-rtos-go-online-officials-get-makeover-too/articleshow/86879129.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna set aside the order of the Telangana high court that an FIR could not be lodged without holding PE and revived criminal proceeding against YSR Congress leader Audimulapu Suresh and his wife T H Vijaya Lakshmi in a disproportionate assets case. “...since the institution of a preliminary enquiry in cases of corruption is not made mandatory before the registration of an FIR under the CrPC, PC Act or even the CBI manual, for this court to issue a direction to that effect will be tantamount to stepping into the legislative domain. Hence, we hold that in case the information received by the CBI, through a complaint or a source information under Chapter 8, discloses the commission of a cognisable offence, it can directly register a regular case instead of conducting a PE.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pe-not-mandatory-for-cbi-to-file-case-supreme-court/articleshow/86879577.cms||---

The amount will be paid in two instalments — one in October and another in March 2022. The residents expressed happiness over the first demand getting fulfilled. “We are thankful to the state government, CM Thackeray and minister of medical education Amit Deshmukh for this timely and good step,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale, president of the central committee of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD). “This is for the first time in the history of the state, one of our demands has been fulfilled within two days of our agitation and discussion with the CM,” he added. Residents attached to MARD had gone on indefinite strike from October 1. Their prime demand was academic fee waiver. Following the strike, Thackeray had discussed the matter with MARD leaders, but categorically ruled out fee waiver citing technical reasons. Instead, he had offered them a one-time acknowledgement allowance to express gratitude for their work during both the waves of Covid-19 pandemic. Accepting this, the doctors had called off their strike on October 4. Resident doctors in Nagpur are also happy to get the first instalment this month only. They said improvement in condition at MARD hostels is next on the card and they are waiting for the government to fulfil that promise also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cm-keeps-promise-docs-to-get-rs1-21l-in-2-instalments/articleshow/86879175.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Delhi||Uphaar case: Delhi court convicts Ansals of tampering with evidence||NEW DELHI: Real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal were convicted on Friday for tampering with evidence in the 1997 Uphaar cinema fire tragedy with the court saying they attacked the very purity and sanctity of the justice system, thereby making it the “victim”. The court further said the “high handedness” of the accused for securing benefit in the trial by any means demonstrated the scant regard they had for the justice delivery system, which is the bedrock of democracy. During the trial in the main case related to the tragedy that claimed 59 lives, the Ansals, along with five others, including the then court staff, had torn, defaced and obliterated crucial documents of the prosecution evidence to secure their acquittal. The Ansals were convicted in this matter. On Friday, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma also convicted former court staffers Dinesh Chand Sharma, PP Batra and Anoop Singh in the evidence tampering case. Two co-accused — Har Swaroop Panwar and Dharamvir Malhotra — died during the course of the trial. It was observed that the accused did their best to sabotage the trial but, unfortunately for them and fortunately for the judicial system, the legal process was robust and strong, immune from such nefarious attacks and could respond to such situations with resilience. “Although time and swift trial was the cost paid by the system,” said the 275-page judgment. The court observed that the accused “tampered with, obliterated, tore, defaced some handpicked documents of the main case through meticulous planning to escape punishment by scuttling the trial process and fiddled with the judicial system with great impunity”. “The manner in which the process of law was subjected to desecration by the accused is no less than defiling the justice administration system… The brazen attitude of the accused is reflective from their conduct, as after destruction of evidence they vehemently opposed the prosecution plea for adducing secondary evidence,” said the court. It added that their misconception that they would get away with their nefarious design from punishment had been exposed to the world at large. The court noted that the trigger to the conspiracy was the order passed by Delhi high court in April 2002 wherein directions were passed to take up the matter of the main case 10 times a month and conclude the trial by December that year. “...The tampering was detected in July (2002), which makes it plain that when the accused got convinced that trial would proceed in a speedy way, they hatched a conspiracy to remove the most crucial documents to escape punishment,” the court noted. After Sharma was removed from service, he was given a job by the accused to ensure the secrecy of the conspiracy as they felt that if he worked anywhere else, he could spill the beans. The court said he was paid double the monthly salary, which went on to show that he was being rewarded for the crime. “Merely because the secondary evidence was allowed to be led/adduced by the court and trial ended in conviction is no ground to believe that accused have not benefited from the said act of destruction of evidence. Their criminal plot/conspiracy to destroy the evidence was achieved at a crucial time knowing well its repercussions on the outcome of the ongoing trial,” said the judge. Neelam Krishnamoorthy, who lost her two children in the fire, said justice had been served and the judgment would go a long way as it was very rampant that people with money tampered with evidence, which was hardly brought to the notice of the judiciary. “The 59 people who lost their lives have got justice and I’m sure they will get peace. This has been due for a long time. These people with all their money power tried every possible thing… I hope it brings in a deterrent,” Krishnamoorthy told TOI. Additional public prosecutor AT Ansari argued that this case had not only brought a bad name to the well-tested criminal justice delivery system, but also eroded the confidence and trust of a common man in the system. Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for the complainant, Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy, argued that the accused had destroyed the most vital piece of evidence. Advocate Tanveer Ahmad Mir, appearing for Sushil Ansal, submitted that the allegations against him were baseless and illogical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-convicts-ansals-of-tampering-with-evidence/articleshow/86879120.cms||Usha Das
---||Madurai||Students stumble upon ancient Chinese potsherds in Ramnad||Ramanathapuram: Ancient Chinese potsherds, believed to be about 1,000 years old, have been discovered near a school at Thirupulani in Ramanathapuram district. President of the Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation (RARF), V Rajaguru, said that the potsherds were discovered by students of the Suresh Sudha Azhagan Memorial Government Higher Secondary School, Thiruppullani, near their school premises. The students - D Manoj, M Praveena, V.Donika and S.Fathima Shifa - studying Class 10, and members of their school’s heritage club, identified the black and red potsherds and broken pieces of deer antlers from a pit that was dug up for constructing a tank. Rajaguru, who validated their findings, said that the potsherds belonging to the period between 12th century AD and 13th century were made of porcelain and celadon and of Chinese origin. The potsherds contain red and dark green designs on a white background. The celadon potsherd is greyish green in colour. The black and red potsherds contain fine designs which have been created on them, maybe by fingernails on the mouth of the pots. The deer antlers are hollow and are that of Uzhai deer, he said. Earlier, Chinese potsherds had been found in the coastal villages between S P Pattinam to Periyapattinam in Ramanathapuram district.

Plastic waste was strewn at the bus stand and the collector, commissioner and volunteers picked them up. Administering the pledge of the movement, Sekhar said that Mahatma Gandhi had not only dreamt of a free India, but also of a clean India. Keeping the surroundings clean was very important, and so was reducing the use of plastic, which is detrimental to the environment, he added.

---||Delhi||More than half of Delhi University’s 70,000 seats taken in first cutoff||NEW DELHI: Out of the 60,904 applications under the first cutoff list, Delhi University (DU) saw over 35,000 admissions till 7pm on Friday, filling over 50% of its 70,000 seats on offer this year. DU extended the payment timings till 11.59pm to let applicants complete the admission process. Many principals at colleges across the campuses said several courses like BA programme were likely to be closed for the second list, to be declared on Saturday. Ramjas College, which had pegged the cutoff for BA (H) political science at 100%, saw 29 admissions for the 30 seats. “A few hours are still left for completing the payment process and BA (H) political science will see surplus students in the unreserved category,” principal Manoj Khanna said. BCom, with a cutoff of 99.25%, is also seeing over-admissions, while some seats are still left in BCom (H). For BSc (H) mathematics, Ramjas saw surplus admissions in the OBC category — almost three times the number of sanctioned seats, Khanna pointed out. “There will not be much of a difference in the asking score under the second cutoff list.” Deen Dayal Updhayaya College, which had a cutoff of 100% for BSc (H) computer science, will remain open for the course in the second list, principal Hem Chand Jain said. “As of 7pm, the college saw 930 admissions, with another 168 left to pay the fees,” he added. In the second cutoff list, Jain said, BSc (H) mathematics, botany and life science will close for all four categories and only general and EWS categories will remain open for BCom (H). “The maximum dip for the unreserved category for the second list will be around 1% point while it may be up to 2% points for the reserved categories,” he said. At Sri Venkateswara College, 487 admissions were completed till Friday evening and officials said around 60% of the BA programme combinations would be closed in the second list. However, BCom (H) and BA (H) political science will remain open for all categories, they said.

---||Nagpur||63 trees felled in Bhandara in violation of amended Act||Nagpur: In violation of the amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, the Bhandara municipal council chief officer allowed the public works department (PWD) to fell 63 trees through two separate permissions. In municipal council jurisdiction, the chief officer is the tree officer empowered to grant permission to fell trees. Chief officer Vinod Jadhav allegedly bypassed the amended Act which mandates declaring 50-year-old as ‘heritage’ trees to increase forest and tree cover, and if at all these trees are allowed to be cut, the project proponent has to plant trees equal to the age of the felled ones. An inquiry against Akot Municipal Council chief officer is already pending for allowing the PWD to fell 153 trees. Most of them were heritage trees. The PWD deputy engineer on June 21 and July 13, 2021, had sought permission to fell and trim 63 trees in government office quarters in Civil Lines. The chief officer granted permission on October 4, 2021, when the amended Act had already come into force. Nadeem Khan, Bhandara honorary wildlife warden, who received complaints from Dr Suhas Gajbhiye and others, raised alarm and stopped large-scale felling but almost all trees were cut. The felling caused huge ecological damage and many birds lost their homes. Khan alleged that no procedure was followed before felling trees and no public comments/objections were invited by issuing an advertisement in local newspapers. “No permission from the tree authority was sought. Trees were also felled at Circuit House under the garb of same permission,” said Khan. Shailendra Singh Rajput of Wildlife Watch Foundation, said, “Two separate tree felling orders were issued with same outward numbers. In one order permission for 27 trees has been granted and in another with the same outward number nod to fell 36 trees has been granted. Moreover, permission to fell additional 12 trees is hand written, thus raising doubts. These trees were felled in the last two days by contractor Naresh Bhure, who is already blacklisted by the forest department.” TOI has copy of the permission letters. Khan said permission was sought to trim only those tree branches that may pose danger to residents but all trees were cut hurriedly and a tractor-load was even transported. “The remaining felled trees have been stocked in front of the government hostel,” he said. PWD deputy engineer Bharat Meshram gave conflicting replies. “We cut only two trees. The remaining trees were chopped by the government hostel superintendent. Though permission was sought to fell 57 trees, I don’t know who fell these trees.” Chief officer Vinod Jadhav did not respond to TOI calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/63-trees-felled-in-bhandara-in-violation-of-amended-act/articleshow/86879696.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The tank in north Madurai has been overflowing continuously for the past two weeks after the heavy rain brought good inflow to it. However, one of the channels meant to discharge the surplus water to Vaigai river through Mastanpatti is blocked by encroachments causing the surplus water to flood vacant plots in this residential area. Manimaran, a resident of Karupayoorani, says the channel has been encroached by people at the tail end for many years since water does not always flow through it. ``Not just this channel, even the one that flows through Gomathypuram which has now turned into a sewage carrier is also encroached. If you walk along it you will see houses constructed right on top of the channel,’’ he said. Senthil Kumar, another resident, says that when the district administration carries out monsoon preparedness works, it should also take into account the traditional channels of tanks which could cause severe inundation like this one, if not kept ready. Petchiammal of Masthanpatti says that after the water started stagnating, they have been experiencing mosquito menace throughout the day. Snakes, centipedes and scorpions have also started invading the houses during the night. There is a school near the stagnant pool of water where children will start coming soon. All this should be considered and the stagnant water removed, said the residents. When corporation officials inspected the area, they found that the encroachment of the PWD channel was the reason for the inundation. They said that the PWD was now taking action to ensure the free flow of water along the channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/encroached-channel-floods-madurai-ward/articleshow/86879388.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Hunt on to find successorto Abhimanyu for parade||Milton.LawrenceMysuru: With just four years remaining for the selection of the next lead elephant that carries the golden howdah, forest officers have a fresh challenge due to the dearth of second-line Dasara elephants.As per the norms, elephants over 60 years are not to be used for challenging jobs. After the superannuation of Arjuna, the onus fell on Abhimanyu who has been assisting the forest department in various tiger and elephant rescue operations across India. The well-mannered Abhimanyu carried the howdah the previous year and will do it this time too.This is the 13th Dasara for the veteran bull elephant. He is 56 years old and likely to retire after three more Dasara celebrations. This is a cause for worry for forest officials as grooming another elephant to carry the howdah is a demanding task. The elephant carrying the golden howdah has to pass through a sea of devotees for about 5kms from Mysuru Palace to Bannimantapa Parade Grounds. There are usually thousands of spectators on both sides of the route.Earlier, officials didn’t have a problem in selection as there were many bull elephants and almost any one was capable of doing the job.After popular Drona, which carried the howdah for over two decades died from electrocution in a forest, the dutiful Balarama did the honours for 15 times. Then came Arjuna, who effortlessly carried nearly 1,000kgs of the golden howdah and accessories. He did the job for 16 years before the onus fell on Abhimanyu.Abhimanyu has never carried the howdah for the full distance. Due to Covid, the procession was confined to the palace and he carried the howdah for 250 metres from the podium. This year too, the cavalcade will be within the palace premises.Sources said though Gopalaswamy is majestic and can carry the howdah, his gait is not elegant. While Dhananjay will be taking part for the third year and still learning the ropes, 34-year-old Ashwaththama is a first-time participant. Vikrama will retire in two years.“We’re grooming second-line Dasara elephants. New elephants are being introduced in the exercise to check their temperament. We have many bull elephants in forest camps. Due to Covid, the number of elephants brought for the celebration has been limited for the past two years,” said deputy conservator of forest (wildlife) V Karikalan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/hunt-on-to-find-successorto-abhimanyu-for-parade/articleshow/86876134.cms||---

This has come as a setback for the education department as the work on Sainik School in Jakholi, Rudraprayag, too, has hit a roadblock. The plan was to have more Sainik Schools in the state, considering the number of aspirants planning to join defence services. Meanwhile, the state education minister Arvind Pandey has said he will request the Centre to rethink the decision as the CM office seems to be serious about the construction of the Sainik School in Rudraprayag. The plan to construct the Jakholi based Sainik School has been stalled for the past nine years. The project approval was given in 2012-13 and later, a land size up to 52 acres was allotted by the government. The responsibility to build a Sainik School lies with the state education department, but it was passed on to the Sainik Welfare Department. Later, both the departments reportedly passed on to the Uttarakhand Rajkiya Nirman Nigam by giving Rs 5 crore each from their own budget. But, out of those Rs 10 crore, the development agencies have spent Rs 9 crore only on the basic structure of the Sainik School. The proposed Sainik School could not come up due to the “government’s inter-departmental conflicts”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/centre-says-no-to-budget-allocation-for-sainik-schools-in-rudraprayag/articleshow/86876136.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Madurai||2 teen kids reunited with four elder siblings after 8 years||MADURAI: It was an emotional reunion for 10-year-old Vijay and his 15-year-old sister Mary with their four elder siblings after eight years in Madurai on Friday. The two were just two and seven years old respectively when they were found begging in front of Madurai railway junction in 2013.  Rescued by Childline, they were produced before child welfare committee (CWC) and taken to homes for children. While the girl grew up in a home in Gandhigram, Dindigul, the boy was sent to an adoption agency and later to a home at Yanaikal in Madurai. Shortly after their rescue, their nomadic parents Shanmugam and Parvathi, astrologers from Sarkarpalayam in Trichy, approached officials to take the children with them. But CWC officials did not oblige, fearing that they would be back to begging. “Nobody came in search of the two children over the years and they continued their studies and have reached class V and IX respectively. Two weeks ago, S Kumar, 41, of Tanjore approached us and claimed to be the brother of the two children,” CWC member B Pandiaraja said. Kumar informed Pandiaraja and colleague Shanmugam that their parents died a few years ago and it was his father’s wish that they should should not abandon the two younger children. Kumar managed to trace Mary and met her in Dindigul two years ago. Meanwhile Mary and Vijay too had not met. On the request of Kumar, CWC searched for the records, verified Aadhaar and other proofs produced by him and arranged the reunion. Kumar came along with his brothers Rajkumar, 35, and Masanam, 28, of Pudukottai and sister Meenakshi, 30, of Manapparai. Mary and Vijay were brought from their homes. Vijay was elated to know that he was not an orphan and that he had five elder siblings. After spending nearly two hours, the elder siblings expressed their wish to visit the two children often. “We gave them permission letters to produce at the homes to visit them,” Shanmugam said. Kumar and the three other elder siblings, who are also astrologers, told CWC officials that they could not complete schooling and wished that their siblings continue studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-teen-kids-reunited-with-four-elder-siblings-after-8-yrs/articleshow/86879277.cms||---

After a month, he switched off his phone and went incommunicado. Shah contacted his driver and found that he had sold her car to someone. On September 12, Vaidya called up Shah and told her that he did not sell her car and had just mortgaged it with someone about which he would tell her later. On September 18, Shah checked the ownership of the car in an RTO app and found that someone had paid insurance on it. She went to the insurance firm and found an agent named Mukesh Brahmbhatt had handled the insurance. When she called up Brahmbhatt, he told her that her car had been transferred to a Bhavnagar man, Alkesh Bhatt.

During all three rounds, Dhananjaya was nervous. He has been participating in Mysuru Dasara since 2017.During the previous two rehearsals too Dhananjaya appeared frightened. This time, he, along with newcomer Ashwaththama was positioned in the second row behind Abhimanyu and Gopalaswamy. Though Ashwaththama (38), rescued from Sakleshpura taluk in Hassan in 2017, is taking part for the first time, he endured the high-decibel firearm shots this time.

Talking to the media, Singh said that he looked forward to meeting all varsity stakeholders and understanding their concerns. He also said that recruitments in the university would be a more regular affair than a one-time activity. Singh was previously the vice-chancellor of Delhi Technological University (DTU). Stating that he has some plans and ideas which he wants to discuss with stakeholders, Singh said, “I will be meeting principals, heads of departments and others to first understand what issues need to be addressed.” Reacting to concerns raised by students regarding high cutoff marks at the university, Singh said, “I would first like to understand the system as DU has been following this system for many years now. If reforms are required, then the deans, heads and principals need to advise me. Appropriate action will be taken depending on the situation. I will be consulting all stakeholders.” “It is best to meet students, see what their concerns are, and then speak to university officials about it,” added Singh. Assuring that recruitments in the university will gain pace over the next few years, Singh explained, “Recruitments should not and will not be a one-time activity. DU has already advertised for 252 posts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-vc-takes-charge-vows-to-streamline-hiring-at-du/articleshow/86879325.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Delhi||Action sought against Delhi University professor Rakesh Pandey for ‘marks jihad’ remark||NEW DELHI: Various students’ unions protested at the Delhi University (DU) campus on Friday demanding action against professor Rakesh Pandey for his comments on students from Kerala. All India Students’ Association (AISA) demanded that the Kirori Mal College (KMC) professor be suspended for his “islamophobic and racist comments” against Muslim students and students from Kerala.   “Alleging a ‘marks jihad’ in Kerala state board, the teacher has parroted the age-old RSS rhetoric against Muslim ‘merit’ and against the people of Kerala. DU is a central university that works on the principles of the Constitution and no compromise with the ideal of secularism in the university will be tolerated,” said Ritwik Raj, secretary of AISA DU. Students’ Federation of India (SFI) also protested against the “discrimination” faced by students from certain state boards. Utkarsh, vice president of SFI’s Delhi unit said, “As per the circular by DU, only 5% of the total admissions after first cutoff is constituted by Kerala board students. The performance of Kerala students is due to hard work of the students as well as the constant effort by the Kerala government to provide access to education even during pandemic.” National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) also protested outside KMC and submitted a memorandum to the college authorities. Kunal Sehrawat, NSUI state president, said, “We have demanded the immediate dismissal of the professor and also demanded an apology.” Meanwhile, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad also protested against unreasonable cut-off marks and demanded that the admission process at DU be stopped immediately. The students’ group also demanded a mechanism for moderation of marks for all state boards across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/action-sought-against-prof-for-marks-jihad-remark/articleshow/86879119.cms||---
---||Delhi||Unvaccinated Delhi govt staff can’t work||NEW DELHI: No unvaccinated Delhi government employee will be allowed to attend office from October 16. In an order issued on Friday, the government said at least one dose of Covid vaccination is mandatory to attend office. All those who have not received even one dose will be marked absent. Around 2 lakh people, including those in municipal corporations and educational institutions, are employed by the Delhi government. The move is aimed at ensuring 100% vaccination coverage in the huge workforce and making government offices safe. Most of the employee associations have welcomed the decision. “All government employees working in departments, autonomous bodies, public sector undertakings, local bodies and educational institutions under the Delhi government including frontline workers, healthcare workers as well as teachers and other staff working in schools and colleges, should get vaccinated (at least first dose) by October 15,” Delhi Disaster Management Authority stated in an order. Those who do not comply will not be allowed to attend office with effect from October 16 till they have taken the first dose and “the said period of absence from duty shall be treated as ‘On Leave’,” said the order. The head of the departments have been asked to verify the vaccination status through the Arogya Setu application or certificate of vaccination produced by the employee. The DDMA order, which has been marked to the staff officer of cabinet secretary and secretary, department of personnel and training, Government of India, suggested that the Government of India may consider issuing similar directions for its employees working in Delhi. It had been decided at the last DDMA meeting that 100% vaccination of all government employees, frontline workers, healthcare workers as well as teachers and other staff working in educational institutions should be ensured because they have frequent interaction with the public and vulnerable sections of society. Since the Covid outbreak in the capital, several government employees working in the office of the LG, Delhi secretariat and other government offices have tested positive for Covid. More than 1.8 crore doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in the capital till now, including 1.24 crore first doses and 63 lakh second doses. But many government employees are yet to take even the first dose. Some claim they are overburdened and due to lack of time away from work, they have not been able to get themselves vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unvaccinated-delhigovt-staff-cant-work/articleshow/86879658.cms||AlokKNMishra

BJP’s Eatala Rajender, TRS party’s Gellu Srinivas Yadav and Balmoori Venkat of Congress are the three main contenders in the October 30 bypolls. Several independent candidates staged a protest in front of the office of the returning officer alleging that they were denied their democratic right to enter the electoral fray. They also wrote a letter to the chief electoral officer explaining how police and polling officials saw to it that they could not file their nominations.  As many as 1,000 field assistants had planned to contest the polls as they were removed from their jobs in the MGNREGS. One of the conditions that was put to the independents was that they should produce a certificate stating that they had taken two doses of vaccine in addition to showing the two doses inoculation certificate of 10 proposers, who also should be physically present at the time of filing of the nomination. “These rules violate the democratic right,” Raju, K Sayanna and B Ravi Teja, who sought to contest as independent. From the time the nomination process began on October 1, independents said they had been facing obstacles. Speaking to agitating field assistants, he said police were only concerned about enforcing the model code of conduct. “Even sloganeering is a violation of model code of conduct at the time of filing of nomination,” he told them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/independents-fume-as-bypoll-plan-fails/articleshow/86879226.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Hotel receptionist stabbed to death in Gandhinagar||AHMEDABAD: A 25-year-old man from Vadodara, who has been working in a five-star hotel in Sector 14 in Gandhinagar, was stabbed to death by some unidentified person in Sector-27 following a brawl. Inspector M B Bharwad of Sector 21 police said that the deceased Devansh Bhatia was working in Hotel Leela in Gandhinagar as a receptionist for three months and was staying at a rented house in Shivam Society in Sector 7. “After completing his night shift on Tuesday, he was given a day off following the night duty, and his weekly off was on Thursday,” he said. Bharwad said Bhatia took tiffin service from a person named Bharat Maru from the same residential society. When Maru called him up on Thursday evening, Bhatia told him that he would collect his tiffin late in the night. But as he did not call back, Maru called him up again at around 11.30pm on Thursday but the phone went unanswered. At around 7.30am on Friday, Bhatia’s father called up Maru and told him that his son had a brawl at a paan shop in Sector-27 public garden. Maru rushed there and found that Bhatia had been stabbed to death. Bharwad said that they have no clue as to who had killed him and what was the motive of the murder. “According to locals who knew Bhatia, he was very shy and simple man who never indulged into any dispute with anyone. So it has become difficult to find the motive of the murder or the killers,” Bharwad said. Bharwad said that the incident might have taken place during the wee hours on Friday and there was no eyewitness of the killing. Prima facie inquiry suggests that he was stabbed multiple times by the accused. He said that apart from Sector-21 police, the local crime branch of Gandhinagar personnel have also been deployed to crack the case. Lack of CCTV in the area has made it more difficult for the cops to identify the accused persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hotel-receptionist-stabbed-to-death/articleshow/86879473.cms||---
---||Lucknow||60% of UP’s eligible population vaccinated with at least 1 Covid dose||LUCKNOW: At least 60% of the eligible population in Uttar Pradesh has taken at least the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to data from the CoWIN portal updated till late on Friday night. This means that three out of five people in the state are partially vaccinated. Data showed that against a target of 15.04 crore persons, more than 9.05 crore persons in the state have taken at least one dose of the vaccine while the number of fully vaccinated persons reached 2.38 crore. Health officials said that this speaks for an achievement of 60% in the first category and more than 16% in the fully vaccinated group. The total number of doses extended in the state reached 11.44 crore, which is highest in the country. UP is way ahead of its nearest contender Maharashtra where 8.64 crore doses of the vaccine have been given. Madhya Pradesh (6.49 crore), Gujarat (6.37 crore) and West Bengal (6.28 crore) follow thereafter. Experts lauded UP over the milestone but asserted that the state must focus on increasing the proportion of the fully immunised population. Meanwhile, 11 cases and 18 recoveries were reported in the state in the past 24 hours. With this, the total number of cases in UP reached 17,09,928 of which 16,86,887 have recovered while 22,896 have died. This translates into a recovery rate of over 98.7% and a recovery rate of 1.3%. Upon adjustment of the new cases and recoveries, the state is left with 145 active cases across 35 districts. Of these, 63% cases are located across six districts, including Lucknow (35), Prayagraj (16), Bareilly (11), Gautam Budh Nagar (10), Meerut (10) and Ghaziabad (8).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/60-of-ups-eligible-popn-vaccinated-with-at-least-1-dose/articleshow/86879367.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Goa||Goa secretary to lose pay if new CZMP deadline lapses||PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has agreed to extend Goa’s deadline to finalise its Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) till December 31. The tribunal has, however, said that if Goa fails to meet the new deadline, as a penalty, the state secretary concerned will not be paid salary from January 2022 till the time the default continues. “This direction is being issued in the light of the earlier direction in order dated November 27, 2019, which remains uncomplied,” the tribunal said. The last deadline set for Goa was August 31, which the state failed to meet. Goa has been granted three extensions already to finalise its CZMP and the state government had sought a fourth. The state’s request for six months’ extension till February 28, 2022, was turned down. The state government had asked for the latest extension stating that it will require time to consider the objections received from public on the draft CZMP. “We note that there is breach of mandate of finalising CZMP as per CRZ Regulations, 2011, for the last 10 years, causing failure to regulate the matters as per law, to the detriment of environment. Having regard to the long delay which has already taken place, we see no justification for granting the extension sought,” the tribunal said. The state cannot go on in a leisurely manner in carrying out its duties, the NGT observed. An application had been first filed before the NGT in 2015 stating that there was rampant degradation of coastal areas in the country in absence of effective regulation. In 2017, the NGT asked the Union environment ministry to file an affidavit as to why CZMP for different states has not been finalised. The tribunal had also issued notices to 13 coastal defaulting states and UTs. The tribunal observed that already six years had passed by 2017 since the CRZ regulation which required states to have CZMPs. A deadline of April 30, 2018, was set for the different states to complete their plans, the time was since then extended by the NGT twice. On expiry of these deadlines, Goa then asked for further extensions, stating that the delay was from the end of the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai. Earlier this year, Goa Foundation approached the tribunal stating that there had been deficiencies in the public hearing conducted by the Goa government. The tribunal found merit in this argument and extended Goa’s deadline till August 31, 2021, which the state failed to meet yet again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-environment-secy-to-lose-pay-if-new-czmp-deadline-lapses/articleshow/86879442.cms||---

Khan said that when people were fighting for their rights during the anti-CAA protest, the government recovered compensation from protestors for damage caused to both public and private properties. “Was the law applicable for a particular community or for all?” he questioned, adding that the minister Ajay Mishra’s son is accused of killing farmers, so the compensation should be paid from his account only rather than paying from the state government. Earlier this week, the UP government announced an ex-gratia of Rs 45 lakh and a government job for the kin of four farmers who died in the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/make-minister-son-pay-compensation-to-dead-farmers-kin-from-their-pockets-ex-aligarh-mla/articleshow/86879549.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Lost Straw: Lower Rice Acreage May Result In Fewer Farm Fires||New Delhi: Data submitted to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR by the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh shows land under paddy cultivation in these states has reduced by 7.7% this year compared with last year. The total paddy straw generation from non-basmati variety of rice has also reduced by around 12.4%. CAQM said that based on this data, fewer cases of stubble burning are expected this year than in 2020. The air commission had directed states to submit action plans to reduce harvest remnant burning this winter, asking each state to promote short duration and early maturing varieties of crops so as to provide a much larger window for paddy straw management. CAQM said on Friday that the central and the state governments of Punjab, Haryana and UP had worked to diversify crops and to reduce the use of a particular variety of rice. The burning of paddy straw from non-basmati crops was a prime concern for them. In a statement, CAQM said, “Crop diversification and moving away from the Pusa-44 variety with short duration, high-yielding varieties are all part of the framework and action plan for control of stubble burning in these states.” According to data from the three states, paddy cultivation is down by around 1.3 million tonnes in Punjab, from 20.05 million tonnes in 2020 to 18.7 million tonnes in 2021; by 0.8 million tonnes in Haryana, from 7.6 million tonnes in 2020 to 6.8 million tonnes this year; and by 0.1 million tonnes from 0.8 million tonnes in 2020 to 0.7 million tonnes in 2021 in the eight NCR districts of UP. The total quantity of straw generated by three states was 28.4 million tonnes in 2020. It is expected to reduce to 26.2 million tonnes this year. “The decrease in non-basmati variety is expected to be even higher. Paddy straw generation specifically from the non-basmati variety of crops is expected to decrease from 17.8 million tonnes in 2020 to 16.1 million tonnes in 2021 in Punjab and from 3.5 million tonnes in 2020 to 2.9 million tonnes in Haryana this year,” said CAQM. As part of the straw management, the bio-decomposer developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute and tried out in Delhi last year with good results will be sprayed over six lakh acres in UP, one lakh acres in Haryana and 7,413 acres in Punjab. The compound leads to quicker and natural decomposition of the straw remnants, with the additional advantage of fertilising the field. CAQM had earlier said the detailed action plans had been formulated based on a framework made by it for each state and directions have been issued for strict implementation of these plans in the individual states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lost-straw-lower-rice-acreage-may-result-in-fewer-farm-fires/articleshow/86879100.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Surat||Gujarat: Three persons replace 63 tonne high quality coal with dust in Bharuch||SURAT: Three persons were booked on Friday for allegedly replacing 63-tonne high quality coal worth Rs 5 lakh with waste dust during transportation from Hazira to Jhagadia in Bharuch. According to the police, the accused took two days to cover the 86km distance which can be covered in three hours in normal situations. The fraud complaint comes at a time when coal prices have shot up due to short supply. Based on a complaint lodged by Yogesh Patel, owner of Ayesha Transport, cops booked the owner of Kiran Transport, Jitu Patel, and two truck drivers — Sanjay Sahu and Rajesh Sahu — for criminal breach of trust under Indian Penal Code in Hazira police station. Police have detained Sanjay and will arrest him after Covid-19 test. The other two accused are yet to be arrested. In his FIR, Patel claimed that he has a contract to transport coal from Adani Port in Hazira to different locations and for that he hires trucks from other transporters for bigger orders. On October 3, he hired two trucks from accused Jitu Patel and the drivers collected a total 63.46 metric tonne coal in two trucks from the port. They were supposed to reach UPL Limited plant in Jhagadia on the same day, but reached only on October 5 evening. Later, the recipients of the consignment informed the supplier that they received only dirt and waste dust and not the quality coal for which they placed order. Soon Patel was informed about the suspected cheating and he approached the police to lodge a complaint. “It is a case of cheating and the accused replaced the high-quality coal with dirt and waste. It is a matter of investigation that since how long the fraud is continue,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/3-replace-63-tonne-high-quality-coal-with-dust/articleshow/86877352.cms||---
---||Nagpur||City mom among those protesting outside Union environment minister’s office in Delhi||Nagpur: City’s Leena Buddhe was among the group of Indian mothers who stood outside the office of Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav on Friday morning. Their sole aim was to draw the minister’s attention towards rising health ailments being caused due to severe air pollution from coal-fired power plants. TOI has been reporting how Nagpur is facing the brunt of toxic emissions, being surrounded by thermal power plants. The emission levels from local power plants have been found to be much higher than the permissible limits for different pollutants. Highlighting that many households in cities like Nagpur and Chandrapur were forced to breathe toxic air due to pollution from plants, Buddhe said, “Local doctors have confirmed that there has been a steady rise in the number of children suffering from respiratory issues who live in the vicinity of these plants. As a mother, we can’t silently watch this. We want the minister to promise us that there will be an action taken against those flouting norms and strict rules would be implemented across the thermal power plants of the country.” As is being reported by the paper, all coal-fired power plants were asked to implement strict emission control norms in 2015. Most of the plants continue to flout the mandated guidelines. Major power plants of the region including the ones at Koradi, Khaparkheda and Chandrapur have not yet installed the necessary pollution-control technologies. The group of mothers, who stood peacefully holding placards, also initiated an online petition — #NoExtensionsToPolluters — in August this year which so far has been by over 1,000 women from different cities. Speaking about how every mother in the country was worried over the rising air pollution compromising the health of children, Gurgaon’s Sherebanu Frosh, who is a mother of two, said, “A report released by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) in March this year stated that pollution, once emitted from a power plant, travels across large distances and harmful emissions from these 12 power plants located in and around the Delhi- NCR region resulted in 218 deaths annually in Delhi. The same report mentions that operation of the power plants in Delhi-NCR under pollution control measures as per 2015, emission standard notification would have negated over 4,700 preterm births, about 7,700 asthma emergency room visits, and approximately 3,000 COPD cases in 2018.” The group of mothers also emphasised that one needs to understand that this is not just a North India problem alone but an issue across the country. “The children hailing from the weaker economic section are the worst hit as their families end up being overburdened by the high cost of treatment and medicines needed for respiratory issues,” added Frosh. Delhi mother Bhavreen Kandhari explained that several reports stated that it was in December 2015 that the Union environment ministry proposed to bring in tighter emission norms for coal-based power plants. “As the winter season sets in, air pollution will soon be at its peak and the most obvious solution for the government would be to regulate the thermal power plant emissions as notified in 2015. Time and again the power plant lobby has managed to show their might by getting extensions, dilutions and paltry penalties for the past four years and kept getting away with their pollution,” said Kandhari. Actor and filmmaker Nandita Das stated that the need of the hour is to push power plants to reduce air pollution. “Studies conducted by scientists in India have found that areas with poor air quality and higher emissions of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 are more likely to have Covid-19 infections and related deaths,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-mom-among-those-protesting-outside-union-environment-ministers-office-in-delhi/articleshow/86876283.cms||Manka Behl
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government in talks with private firms for restarting power supply||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat government is working towards resolving the looming crisis over the state’s power sector. For this, the state-government run Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd has initiated talks with companies like Tata Power, Adani Power and Essar Power Gujarat Ltd for restarting their imported coal fired power projects that have been shut down for some time due to spiralling global coal prices. “The three companies have signed long-term power purchase agreements to supply 4,000 MW to GUVNL. We are negotiating with these companies so they can restart their supply and will soon reach an agreement with them,” said an official at GUVNL. Adani and Tata have shut down their supply in the last one and half months with coal prices rising 40% in the last few months, said sources. Adani has signed PPA for 1,000 MW while Tata Power has signed PPA with GUVNL for 1,800 MW. Both these plants are located in Mundra. Essar had shut down its 1,200 MW power plant at Salaya in March citing financial viability issues. The state is facing a power deficit to the tune of 20-25% from the last few weeks, said a state government official. In the last few days the state is facing a daily shortfall of 50 million units to 80 million units out the total current requirement of 360-370 million units. “There is a shortage of about 20% during peak hours that is being met by purchasing costlier electricity from power exchanges,” said a state government official aware of the matter. As per an action plan chalked out by the government, GUVNL has recently entered into power purchase pacts with private companies for the supply of 1,500 MW on a short-term and mid-term basis. Also, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has begun the supply of additional 1200 MW of power to GUVNL, said sources. More than half of India’s 135 coal-fired power plants, which contribute around 70% of India’s electricity, are running on low plant load factor (PLF) as their coal stocks are critically low. “There is a recovery in an economy that has led to an increase in power consumption. But it comes at a time when coal mines are blocked due to incessant rains. Also, the generation from renewable energy sources has gone down in the state due to weather conditions,” said an energy expert. GUVNL is engaged in the business of bulk purchase and sale of electricity in Gujarat. Through its owned plants and by way of bulk purchase, the company has a capacity of about 25,000 MW. Of this, 6,500 MW is by way of wind, 4,500 MW capacity is from solar generation, 2,600 is gas-based power plants, about 3,800 by imported coal-fired plants and about 7,000 MW is by domestic coal plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-in-talks-with-firm-for-restarting-power-supply/articleshow/86879514.cms||Maulik Pathak

At its urban post offices, however, consumers are facing many difficulties due to shortage of staff, lack of remapping of post office jurisdiction, need for new post offices, etc. “It may be noted that although the urban areas of Panaji, Margao, Vasco, Ponda and Mapusa have expanded, with many new housing complexes and apartments and thousands of consumers relocating their residences, the postal services have not been streamlined to match this change,” coordinator of the Goa consumer action network (Goacan) Roland Martins said. Goa Posts clarified that they are already in the process of remapping and streamlining all the post offices, for which a committee has been formed. “We will also write to all the municipal authorities to provide us with a list of high-storey buildings. Following which, we will write to housing societies to install letter boxes,” senior superintendent of posts Sudhir Jakhere said. While a new post office was opened in Miramar, the existing Panaji Market post office was shut down while the post office at the old Secretariat was shifted to the new Secretariat at Alto Porvorim.

---||Dehradun||U’khand gets new airport terminal bldg, heli services for seven routes flagged off||Dehradun: Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and chief minister Pushar Singh Dhami inaugurated a new terminal building at Jolly Grant Airport on Friday. Built at a whopping Rs 325 crore, the terminal has increased the passenger per hour capacity of the airport from 250 to 1,200. Besides, Dhami and Scindia also flagged off helicopter services for seven key routes in the Himalayan state. Scindia announced the Dehradun airport will be developed as per international standards, start air service to three more locations and start chopper service on 18 routes. Constructed in the first phase, the new terminal has a total area of 28,729 square metres built at a cost of Rs 325 crore. The second phase of work is in progress. In Phase-II, the building will be further expanded to an area of 14,047 sqm at a cost of Rs 132 crore. The new terminal has 36 check-in counters and four aerobridges. Tourists and travellers can also catch a glimpse of the state’s art and culture, such as Char Dham and Brahma Kamal, in the new building. In his address, Scindia said, “For better air connectivity airports are being expanded, upgraded and beautified. Previously, Dehradun airport had the capacity of 250 people per house. This capacity has been increased to 1,200 passengers. The passenger limit has been increased by six times.” He pointed out that the Phase-II will raise the passenger capacity to 1,800 per hour. “This is a region where there is immense potential for natural beauty, tourism, industry, trade. Together, the Central and state governments will take Uttarakhand to new heights,” he added. CM Dhami said that air connectivity is being strengthened in the state with the cooperation of the Centre. “The state has reduced the weight of Aviation Turbo Fuel (ATF) in Uttarakhand from 20% to 2%. The intention behind this is that more and more heli companies should move to the state.” Chopper service for Dehradun-Haldwani/Pantnagar-Dehradun and Sahastradhara-Chinyalisaur-Sahastradhara was flagged off by CM Dhami and Scindia. With this, heli services have started for seven new routes in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-gets-new-airport-terminal-bldg-heli-services-for-seven-routes-flagged-off/articleshow/86876188.cms||Kautilya Singh

But what I am looking for is to provide an entry point into India, a gateway into India, for the mid-sized, smaller French companies. The reason is because you are guys who are going to grow big and I would like to be a part of that growth story,” Telangana industries and IT minister KT Rama Rao said here on Friday. KTR, who was addressing participants at the 4th edition of Indo French Investment Conclave here, Telangana will either meet its competitor states’ offer or beat it to attract French companies to its shores. The conclave saw a delegation of over 100 French company CEOs, CXOs and diplomats troop in Hyderabad. The Ambassador of France to India, Emmanuel Lenain, said, “Many French groups have already invested in Telangana, particularly in biotech, IT and aeronautics. These Indo-French business endeavours in key sectors in Telangana also help to strengthen the strategic partnership between our two countries.” In February 2020, GMR Infrastructure Limited (GIL) had announced a partnership with Groupe ADP that had acquired 49% stake in GMR Airports. Antoine Crombez, deputy CEO, GMR Airports said, “Around Rs 6,300 crore is getting invested by the Hyderabad airport to increase the airport’s capacity to 34 million passengers.” Even French fruit beverages manufacturing company Georges Monin has doubled investment in its upcoming manufacturing plant in Telangana to Rs 200 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/t-can-be-gateway-to-india-for-french-cos/articleshow/86879398.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Colleges to reopen from Monday, offices can work at full capacity||Pune: Colleges in the city can reopen from Monday for in-person classes after the Pune Municipal Corporation issued a notification based on deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s announcement on a host of further relaxations for Pune district at the Covid-19 review meeting on Friday. The government has not made a state-wide declaration on reopening of colleges as yet. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar’s order also allowed private offices to operate at full capacity, and included an extension of the operating deadline till 11pm for restaurants, food courts and bars throughout the week with food delivery services till midnight. Coaching classes can function at 50% capacity. According to the notification which covers areas under the Khadki and Pune Cantonment boards, the order for restaurants, food courts and bars comes into effect from Friday till further notice. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil and Pune’s collector Rajesh Deshmukh said they would issue orders for the municipal limits and the rural areas respectively, on Saturday. Pawar said that students who have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, and fully vaccinated staff members can start attending college in-person from Monday. “All these institutions have to follow strict Covid-19 protocols,” he added. Students who have taken a single jab will not be allowed, and those arriving in Pune to attend college will have to show a negative RT-PCR test before entering the campus. “This is also the view taken by the administration of the colleges and universities with whom we consulted,” Pawar said. Pune district has registered the second highest vaccination numbers in the state and Maharashtra is first among fully vaccinated states, the deputy chief minister said. “The district’s weekly positivity rate has dipped to 3.01% with PMC registering 2.5%, PCMC at 2.3% and Pune rural at 3.6%. So, we have decided to reopen colleges with full precautions,” he added. Tourist spots will also open from Monday, the deputy chief minister said. Vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University said they will be wait for the official communication before deciding on the course of reopening the university for students. Pawar said they would urge the central government to reduce the duration between two vaccine doses. “In the beginning, the gap was 21 and 28 days, now it is 84 days between two doses. Considering the availability of vaccines now, the duration can be reduced. But it is up to the central government to decide,” he added. The request would be discussed with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, and then put up to the Centre, the deputy chief minister further said. Prashant Girbane, director-general of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industry and Agriculture said that the deputy chief minister’s announcement on more relaxations will speed up economic recovery, but citizens and businesses will have to be more responsible about getting the vaccine and follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Charanjeet Singh Bhogal, chief operating officer of Hinjewadi Industries Association, said the festive season is here and it will be a while before the IT sector operates at full capacity in offices. “Right now, attendance is mostly voluntary, and only for the fully vaccinated. Full capacity offices will probably operate not before early 2022,” he added. Lovely Narang, president of United Hospitality Association, said that the extension of the operational deadline till 11pm would help a great deal. “We can streamline guests and ensure less crowd at any given time. When the guests are spread over an extended period of time, it will prevent any spread of infection. The extension will also help us increase our business. However, we would request the government to extend this deadline to 1.30am as was promised, at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-to-reopen-from-monday-offices-can-work-at-full-capacity/articleshow/86879602.cms||---

Now, the NMC has sought help of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) to repair pothole-ridden roads speedily. “NMC will pay money to NIT for the work,” municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI. “The NMC will repair all bad roads in the city before November-end,” he said. The city has around 3642.08km roads. Apart from NMC, three other agencies — NIT, state’s public works department and National Highways Authority of India — are responsible for maintaining the roads. NMC owns 2482.94km roads, NHAI around 29.80km in the city while NIT and PWD own 965.320km and 148.02km, respectively. The NMC’s hotmix plant at Hingna MIDC is outdated and has 30 tonne per hour capacity. NIT’s batchmix plant can work with 80 to 100 tonne per hour capacity. Sources said that the NMC carries out tar road works at the cost of around Rs100 crore per year. Due to low capacity of its hotmix plant, NMC could carry out repair works for potholes or asphalting worth Rs5 crore only. Major works are being done through private contractors. Extended monsoon has delayed repair works for 15 bad roads. Superintending engineer Ajay Pohekar said that the civic chief and standing committee headed by Prakash Bhoyar had given nod to invite tenders for re-carpeting 15 bad roads. “Asphaltation will take some more time,” he said. There is moisture below the roads due to rains. “If we carry the asphalting work now, the road will wear off soon. At least a fortnight of dry days is needed before starting the work,” he said. Meanwhile, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has organized a special general body meeting on October 13 over proposal for re-appropriation of Rs41.50 crore in NMC budget for sanctioning additional funds required te repair bad roads. Recently, the standing committee meeting had given nod to re-appropriate Rs41.50 crore for improving condition of tar roads. For this, funds have been deducted from 12 heads.

The newly-inaugurated anganwadi centre is equipped with modern amenities and technology-backed platforms, including digital content, structure curriculum, assessment tools to monitor the early education progress of a child, CCTVs, and interactive toys with learning gadgets. The digital anganwadi also has preloaded content to be taught to the students across the centres for six weekdays. The objective of the digitised anganwadi centre — a joint initiative of the department and Ampersand Group, a firm involved in providing sustainable solutions — is to ensure strong formative years for children. “The idea behind digitising the anganwadi is to give a boost to Prime Minister’s Digital India Mission and to achieve the goal of early childhood care and education as per New Education Policy, 2020. We will acquaint some eight lakh children between the ages of six months and six years with technology in their formative years. We want to reduce their educational expense and give them the best study atmosphere at our anganwadi centres,” said HC Semwal, secretary, women and child development department of Uttarakhand. Echoing a similar sentiment, Rekha Arya, minister of women and child development department, said, “We will observe significant improvement in the levels of learning in the students. This will also lead to an increase in the enrolments in anganwadi centres.” She added that such centres will be opened across Uttarakhand and in areas where the internet connectivity is poor, the digital anganwadi centres will be run with the satellite facility. Currently, the anganwadi centres in Uttarakhand have 1 lakh registered pregnant women and 85,000 lactating women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-gets-its-first-digital-anganwadi-in-dehradun/articleshow/86876322.cms||Shivani Azad

It held that the allegations of corruption in the selection process for appointments of AROs could not be substantiated from records. Passing the order, a bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “I find that the petitioners have not been able to substantiate the allegations of corrupt practices, manipulations and illegal and arbitrary exercise of powers, while conducting the selection process for the post of ARO and, therefore, this court cannot permit the petitioners to open a fishing and roving inquiry of the selection, especially when the petitioners could not secure marks above the cut-off-marks in their written examination.” The bench passed the order on the writ petition moved by unsuccessful candidates Ankur Saroha and another. The petitioners had challenged the selections of AROs on the plea that corruption had prevailed in the selection as several near and dear ones of key officials of secretariat and the agencies which conducted the examination were appointed illegally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-junks-plea-to-quash-jobs/articleshow/86879368.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Kolkata||Farmers’ protest, NRC: Political issues enter Durga Puja pandals as themes in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Theme pujas that took Kolkata by storm around two decades ago have over the years offered millions an insight into not only the brilliant minds of artists and their innovation , but also evolved in recent times to present commentaries on more serious and darker sociopolitical issues that haunt our lives. In 2017, demonetisation or ‘notebandi’ was the theme in two Puja pandals in the city and its suburbs. Last year, at least three pandals highlighted the plight of migrant labourers left to find their way back from distant lands on their own after the country shut down for the pandemic. This year, two Puja pandals, situated at the two ends of the city, have again showcased two political issues— the new farm laws and the contentious National Register of Citizens (NRC). Both Rintu and Arniban believe artists cannot be dumb spectators to the troubling times India is passing through. Barisha Club in BehalaTheme artist Anirban Das, who had last year highlighted the pandemic-induced shutdown in the pandal of Dum Dum Park Bharat Chakra with larger-than-life motifs of daily life to showcase a city waking up from a slumber to usher in the Puja, has this time sought to shake the audience’s conscience by putting the spotlight on farmers’ protests and last week’s carnage in Lakhimpur, where a speeding vehicle appeared to mow down protesting farmers. At the very entrance to the pandal is a giant replica of a tractor used by farmers to till the land. This is followed by a wall graffiti of a vehicle and a farmer lying on its path with a line in Bengali that reads “Motorgari uray dhulo, peeshe morey chashigulo (Farmers are crushed under the wheels of cars that speed away, raising a dust storm)”. Anirban said the graffiti had been created to depict how poor farmers were exploited, with the vehicle being used as a metaphor for the wealthy; the Lakhimpur incident added a stark and chilling representation of the horror that had played out at the protest site. “I was working on a theme to showcase the history of farm protests in India, from the Tebhaga movement to recent ones, when the horrific incident happened in Lakhimpur. I have mentioned the name Lakhimpur in one of the several placards that lie scattered, as though abandoned in a hurry, after being lathi-charged by the police,” explained Anirban. A collage of hundreds of sandals also depicts a stampede as a result of the lathi-charge to disperse the protesters using brute force. In Behala, where Puja pandals have exploded into prominence ever since they adopted themes and wowed visitors with installations in confined spaces. Barisha Club theme artist Rintu Das broke away from pure aesthetics last year to present Goddess Durga as a migrant worker, queuing up for relief with her four children. This year, Rintu has showcased the plight of “refugees”, who are now faced with uncertainty again after being displaced during Independence or during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The reference is to the NRC that threatens to uproot people if they are unable to prove their citizenship through documents. “My theme is ‘Bhagir Ma’ (A mother divided). I start from a time in history when acting on a dream, Raja Ballabh Sen unearthed a 2.5ft statue of Maa Durga hidden amid the overgrowth in a forested patch near present-day Dhaka and established the Dhakeshwari temple. After Partition, millions were rendered homeless and had to migrate. Even Maa Durga wasn’t spared and had to be relocated to a temple in Kumartuli, where she is now worshipped. But she has no document to prove she is an Indian citizen. The terror of being forcibly displaced that had spread in Assam and the rest of the Northeast and indeed the rest of the country due to the NRC issue is haunting many mothers, including Maa Durga,” explained Rintu. The artist has crafted a powerful image of a caged Durga on a truck stranded in noman’s land between the India-Bangladesh border with her children and a Dhakeshwari idol in her lap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/farmers-protest-nrc-political-issues-enter-durga-puja-pandals-as-themes/articleshow/86879625.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Delhi||Withdrawal symptoms: Cooler nights & bad air in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department officially declared the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from Delhi on Friday, making it a delay of 13 days from the normal withdrawal date of September 25. Colder winds from the northwest are expected in the coming days, leading to a drop in night temperature but a deterioration in air quality. The overall AQI had already begun to touch the higher end of the ‘moderate’ category on Friday, with two stations in Delhi even recording ‘very poor’ air in the morning. A delayed withdrawal hasn’t been uncommon since 2015. In 2019, the monsoon departed on October 10 and on October 8 in 2016. In fact, based on data for the past three decades, the normal date of monsoon withdrawal from Delhi was recently revised from September 21 to four days later. During the monsoons this year, officially between June 1 and September 30, Delhi received 1,169.7mm of rainfall against the normal 648.9mm — an excess of 80%. To put this in perspective, the city received 404.3mm of rainfall in the 2019 season and 576.6mm last year. With the 3.4mm additional rainfall in October, 2021 had the third wettest season for Delhi, behind 1964 with 1,190.9mm of rainfall and 1933 with 1,420.3mm. “The southwest monsoon has withdrawn from some more parts of Gujarat, most parts of Rajasthan, entire Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and some more parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh today,” said IMD’s bulletin on Friday. A met official explained that the withdrawal ushered in changes in meteorological conditions, including wind direction, with cooler winds expected to blow in from the northwest. While the days may be warm, night temperatures may drop 2-3 degrees Celsius in the next seven days. Air quality will suffer now, with the overall 24-hour AQI on Friday spiking to 167 from 127 on Thursday. In the morning, the two stations at Dwarka and Anand Vihar had the air in the ‘very poor’ category with AQI of over 300. The Shadipur station logged an AQI of 206 (poor). The system of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, a government forecasting body, predicted deterioration in air quality in the next three days owing to a mixture of colder air and stubble burning in northwest India. “Delhi’s AQI is in the moderate category with PM10 as main pollutant due to fusion of cold, dry and polluted air with fire emissions and local road dust re-suspension,” said SAFAR. Delhi’s air would be between moderate and poor levels for the next three days, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/withdrawal-symptoms-cooler-nights-bad-air/articleshow/86879104.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt doing nothing to arrest Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party on Friday sharpened its attack on the ruling BJP over the Lakhimpur incident in which four farmers and a journalist were mowed down by a jeep belonging to the son of Union minister of state for home. Party’s national president Akhilesh Yadav said the government is merely doing formalities and has done nothing to arrest the Union minister’s son. “It seems that the government is sending flowers to the accused instead of ensuring his arrest. How can there be justice when the minister has not resigned from the post. If police will go to the minister’s house to question his son, they will first salute the minister. How can there be justice in such a situation,” Akhilesh said, adding that the minister should resign from the post. The former UP chief minister accused the police of indulging in formalities merely to show that the cops are serious about the probe. “The reality is that it was only after the Supreme Court took up the issue that the government has been compelled to move in the name of action against the accused. It is only because of the Supreme Court that the victim families are now hopeful of justice,” Akhilesh said, while talking to the media in Bahraich after meeting the family members of local farmer Gurwinder Singh of Raghunathpur and Daljeet Singh of Nanpara. He said even the Supreme Court has questioned the government over the pace of investigations. The Samajwadi Party on Friday also tweeted a videoclip of a news bulletin screening a BJP MLA threatening farmers at a public meeting purportedly in Lakhimpur. In the videoclip, the MLA can supposedly be heard saying that the people should not show black flags to them. The MLA can be heard boasting that they can do whatever they want. The SP questioned the statements of the MLA and demanded action against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-doing-nothing-to-arrest-mins-son-akhilesh/articleshow/86879372.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

This followed inspections carried out on food business operators (FBOs) in Trichy city, Mannachanallur and Thuraiyur areas by food safety officers on Thursday and Friday. Designated officer (DO) of the food safety and drug administration department R Ramesh Babu said 15 of the more than 60 units manufacturing savouries in these areas were found to have violated food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI) rules by not printing the date of manufacture, expiry and address of the unit on the packets. The department has issued notice to the units to rectify the mistakes in seven days failing which they will be booked under FSSAI Act, said Babu. It was the rampant display of savouries in shops around the bus stands including Chathiram and in the rural areas that led to the inspections in the manufacturing units. Babu said that by not printing the dates and their address, manufacturers were trying to keep the savouries beyond their shelf life. “Unmindful of the health hazards caused by the consumption of such snacks and savouries, people travelling by bus buy them and end up with health issues,” he said. Since manufacturing and sale of savouries will pick up everywhere ahead of Diwali, the food safety department has asked people to check for the required information printed on the packs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/public-advised-to-check-expiry-date-of-savouries/articleshow/86879170.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Currently, there are a total of 33,637 active patients in Maharashtra. Of them, 24,682 patients (74.44%) are undergoing treatment either at their homes or in hospitals in Pune, Mumbai, Ahmednagar, Thane, and Satara. And another 4,954 patients (14.94%) are on treatment in Raigad, Solapur, Sangli, Nashik, and Sindhudurg. In case of Pune, however, the district health office data on Thursday stated that the active caseload in the district was 5,715 as against the state health department data of 8,593. Officials attributed the difference to delay in recovered patients’ data in the state health department records. In 16 districts, the number of active cases has gone below 100. “In fact, the number has reduced to a single digit in eight districts — Nandurbar (1), Gondia (1), Bhandara (2), Dhule (3), Nanded (8), Washim (8), Wardha (8) and Yavatmal (9),” Awate said. Senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “Globally the epicentres of Covid transmissions have been industrial and education hubs. The five districts which are presently accounting for maximum number of cases are industrial or educational hubs.” “Such cities and towns attract floating population, including immigrants from neighbouring small towns and villages. Such mass movements affect the transmission dynamics of all contagious diseases, including respiratory infections,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-among-5-dists-with-75-of-states-active-cases/articleshow/86879510.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Trichy||Anbumani calls for scheme to clean up Cauvery||Trichy: Citing the latest findings about the presence of contaminants in Cauvery river in the research carried out by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, PMK leader Dr Anbumani Ramadoss, MP, has appealed to the state government to devise a scheme to clean up the river. The Rajya Sabha MP said that the study published in “Science of the Total Environment” pointed to the presence of anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and diclofenac, anti-hypertensive such as atenolol and isoprenaline, stimulants like caffeine, antidepressants such as carbamazepine and antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin in the Cauvery water. This is besides contamination by arsenic, zinc, chromium, lead and nickel. “Cauvery river has medicinal value at its origin but it loses its quality when effluents are mixed with it,” he said. Stating that several pharmaceutical companies, dyeing units, garment factories, chemical factories, sugar factories and other industries thrive on the banks of Cauvery, Anbumani said the discharge of improperly treated industrial effluents was the reason for this state. He warned that Cauvery river will transform into a sewage canal if this goes unchecked. He said ‘Nadandhai Vazhi Cauvery’ launched by the AIADMK government to restore the river has not seen any progress as the central government did not sanction funds. Hence, Tamil Nadu government should come out with a scheme to clean up Cauvery and ensure proper treatment of effluents, and the central government should provide aid to the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/anbumani-calls-for-scheme-to-clean-up-cauvery/articleshow/86879168.cms||---

The concept includes establishing a stall with a temporary roof wherein books will be kept in wooden/metal cabinets and people can get them issued for reading at this place only. One such library was inaugurated at Madhav Park in Rajouri Garden area recently and more will be set up. Standing Committee Chairman Col (retd) BK Oberoi said that the initiative, Sahej, was aimed at helping people access newspapers, magazines and books at these open libraries, especially in the morning when they come for fresh air. “The idea will benefit senior citizens also, as they can enjoy reading books while soaking up the sun during winters. They can sit on benches and chairs to spend quality time,” said the chairman. The facility will be open from 9 am to 5 pm. Deputy commissioner, SDMC (West Zone) Rahul Singh urged residents of the area to donate books for the open library. It has a collection of 350 books as of now. “A guard and some other staff from the horticulture department have been deputed 24x7 in the park to ensure maintenance and safety of the library. This library has been set up with the help of NGO ‘Star Foundation’. More such libraries will be opened in parks in the West Zone,” he said. A library was opened at a park in Punjabi Garden a few months back. “We are selecting the parks, which have a footfall of at least 500-600 people during morning or evening hours, so that more and more interested walkers can avail the facility,” said Oberoi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/read-your-favourite-thriller-as-you-soak-up-the-sun-in-this-open-library/articleshow/86879326.cms||Vibha Sharma

As the lockdown has widened the gap in teaching-learning process, this assessment was aimed at helping teachers know the level of understanding of the subject by the students and train them accordingly. Students appear for the quiz in high-tech labs in high and higher secondary schools. Students appear for objective type questions from all the subjects in the computer-based online test designed by State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT). School education secretary Kakarla Usha visited a few government schools in Erode district on Wednesday to see the progress of these programmes. “While most of the competitive exams are conducted online, these tests can serve as an orientation for the students who wish to appear for competitive exams and also entrance tests,” Erode district chief education officer K Ramakrishnan said. Coimbatore district chief education officer N Geetha said the quiz is conducted in 197 high-tech labs across the district. Four headmasters, each in an educational district in Coimbatore, have been asked to monitor the programmes on Saturday and Tuesday. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/education-dept-conducts-general-quiz-for-class-x/articleshow/86879169.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: 20k daily tests in rural areas ahead of Dasara, Diwali||PUNE: The district administration has set a target of conducting at least 20,000 tests daily in rural areas in the weeks preceding Dasara and Diwali because of higher weekly Covid positivity rate there than that in the civic limits. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Wednesday issued an order to scale up collection of swabs at all rural and sub-district hospitals as well as at primary health centres, besides directing the laboratories to update the reports daily or face action. About 96 rural hospitals, sub-district hospitals and primary health centres in the rural areas have been given a daily target of collecting samples. “Nearly 146 centres in the rural areas have been directed to set a target of testing 100 to 300 persons daily to achieve the target. All high- and low-risk contacts and super spreaders have to be tested,” said Dr Milind Kulkarni, the nodal officer for testing in the district. At present, the testing ranges between 10,000 and 15,000 daily in the rural areas. Of them, 70% are RT-PCR tests and 30% are rapid antigen tests (RATs). The rural areas continued to register a higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) of 3.6% this week also as against about 2% in the city areas. The average WPR for Pune district was 3.01%. “So, we have set a target to increase testing in the rural areas,” said Kulkarni. He said while RT-PCR data was being fed by laboratories, the RAT data update was taking time because of shortage of staffers at many centres. The district administration has extended help to the centres directed to feed the later. District health officials attributed the higher WPR of Pune on ICMR portal to the delay in feeding the RAT data and the negative RT-PCR reports. “Efforts are on to ensure that the data is fed daily by providing all assistance in terms of increasing the manpower,” said an official. An official from the rural health centre said some employees were appointed on contract to key-in the data during the first and the second wave of the pandemic. “Their contracts have been discontinued. So, data entry is being delayed. We have sought additional staff,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/20k-daily-tests-in-rural-areas-ahead-of-dasara-diwali/articleshow/86879603.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Mothers seek clampdown on thermal plants||NEW DELHI: Holding placards to highlight the dangerous impacts of thermal power plants on the health of people, especially children, across the country, a group of mothers from different cities stood outside the office building of the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Friday morning. The group had in August initiated an online petition— #NoExtensionsToPolluters—asking the ministry of environment forest & climate change to strictly ensure that all coal-powered TPPs adhere to the 2015 emission control norms. The petition, which already has over 1,000 signatures, says emissions norms continue to be flouted by TPPs across the country. A copy of the petition was later handed over to the staff of Union minister of state for environment, forest and climate change Ashwini Kumar Choubey by the group. “We want the minister to stand on the side of our children’s future. We hope that he can champion the cause and lead by example by ensuring that all TPPs are made to adhere to the mandated norms,” said Sherebanu Frosh, a mother of two, who lives in Gurgaon. Speaking about how every mother in the country was worried over the rising air pollution, Frosh said that a report released by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in March this year stated that harmful emissions from 12 power plants located in and around the Delhi-NCR resulted in 218 deaths annually in Delhi. As winter sets in, air pollution will soon be at its peak and the most obvious solution for the government will be to regulate the thermal power plant emissions as notified in 2015, said Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist and mother, who is based in Delhi. “Time and again, the power plant lobby has managed to show their might by getting extensions, dilutions and paltry penalties over the past four years. It’s time to introduce them to the most powerful lobby, which includes ‘mothers’ who care for their children,” she said. Leena Buddhe, a mother from Nagpur, said cities like Nagpur and Chandrapur were also breathing toxic air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mothers-seek-clampdown-on-thermal-plants/articleshow/86879110.cms||---

Bhujbal had chaired a meeting of the MLAs, district authorities and health officials over the prevailing Covid-19 situation. “There are instances when people go to Ahmednagar, where the number of cases are very high. Since we cannot ban people from moving around, we have decided to cancel the provision of home isolation. Each patient will be institutionally quarantined,” he said. The minister said the health authorities are doing their best to treat and track down the infected number. However, people should be disciplined and prevent the spread of the disease by implementing all Covid-appropriate norms, Bhujbal noted. “The number of Covid cases is slightly lower than last week, but the seem to be hovering around 1,000 for last few weeks. While cases have gone down everywhere, the rise in cases in three talukas is a matter of concern for us,” he said.

The minister, who spoke to reporters soon after landing at Lucknow airport, said, “He (Ashish) will present himself in front of investigative agencies with evidence to prove his innocence.” “The digital record of the phone location will prove that my son was not at the spot when the incident happened. If you have watched the videos of October 3, you would know that disguising as farmers, rioters lynched people. I believe my son, too, would have been murdered had he been present at the spot,” said Mishra on allegations that his son is involved in Lakhimpur violence.Mishra slammed the opposition and assured that the government would do a fair investigation into the case. “This is a BJP government led by Yogi Adityanath and there would be an unbiased probe.

The court clarified that as an interim arrangement, it is granting permission to the suspended councillors to attend the session, which would be subject to the members maintaining decorum in the House. If EDMC is successful in defending the suspension order, appropriate orders will be passed regarding the presence of the suspended members in the meeting. “It is directed that by way of an interim arrangement, the petitioners be permitted to attend the special session of the respondent today(Friday). However, the same would be subject to the undertaking by the senior counsel for the petitioner that they will maintain the decorum of the House, and it is clarified that the permission granted to attend the session would be subject to the outcome of the petition,” the court said. The court also issued notice on the petition by 17 suspended members and also sought the stand of the mayor of East Delhi, Shyam Sunder Aggarwal. The petitioners said the order of suspension was illegal and contrary to the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, which provides for suspension of a councillor only in the presence of two orders of withdrawal from two successive meetings within fifteen days of each other.

The board said so after admitting that air quality in various places in Gujarat is very poor. It said the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has placed four cities —Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot — in the list of 102 cities of the country marked as “non-attainment cities” under National Clean Air Programme. It also submitted that under the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI), the CPCB has declared Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Vapi, Surat, Rajkot, and Vatva as “critically polluted”. Bhavnagar, Morbi, Junagadh, and Ahmedabad (Naoda-Odhav) have been declared “severely polluted” areas. The GPCB filed an affidavit and revealed this information in response to a PIL filed by advocate Amit Panchal seeking a ban on the use of coal for industrial purpose and to make industries use CNG or PNG. The government has been constantly monitoring the ambient air quality at strategic locations under various Air Quality Monitoring Programmes to check parameters such as PM 2.5 levels. The GPCB said that the use of coal is permitted throughout the country and in manufacturing activities in Gujarat only if industries adopt and implement Air Pollution Control Devices and measures. The GPCB said that it prepared an action plan in 2019 and the CPCB has approved it. The plan includes measures such as controlling pollution by phasing out vehicles after 15 years of use, the installation of air pollution control devices, and ensuring emission standards in industries. There are three state-level committees to implement the measures. Stringent norms are in place for solid fuel-based utilities to reduce particulate matter, the GPCB said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/have-plan-to-cut-air-pollution-gpcb-to-hc/articleshow/86879572.cms||---

Speaking at a conclave organised by a television channel, the CM said that members of the Opposition who wanted to visit the victims’ families were only putting up a show of sympathy and there were several ‘faces’ among them who could be behind the violence. “Everyone is equal in front of law. Nobody, irrespective of their party affiliation, will be spared. However, as per Supreme Court, we cannot arrest anyone on the basis of just someone’s allegations. A case has been filed on the basis of a written complaint and investigation into the incident is under way,” the CM said when asked about the possible resignation of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni and arrest of his son Ashish Mishra, who is named in the FIR. The CM said that the main work of the government after such an incident was to maintain peace and harmony. Opposition leaders who were making a beeline for Lakhimpur were no goodwill messengers. The CMs of Chhatisgarh and Punjab, he said, had been unable to manage their own states but were throwing stones at his government to hide their failures. “Where were Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav during when Corona was on the rampage? Everyone, including family of the victims said that they appreciated the government’s work we and the rest should not do politics in this matter,” he said. On Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s sweeping the floor of the guest house where she was kept after detention by the police, the CM said that people had thought that she worthy of nothing more. Yogi Adityanath also rubbished the claim of Opposition parties that Brahmins were being harassed in the state. “They are not in favour of Brahmins, they are not in favour of Hindus, they are only in favour of Taliban. In Kheri they were on a political tour and wanted to create a rift between Hindus and Sikhs. Asauddin Owaisi is quiet on what is happening in Kashmir,” he said. Referring to the speech of Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra and Haryana chief minister ML Khattar on the farmers’ demonstration, the CM said: “There is a difference between a political speech and threat. There is no meaning of such statements as political speeches are made according to situations. While one should be careful about making such statements, when made they should not be taken seriously. However, no one can take law in their hands and kill someone on the basis of such statements,” he said.” On religious conversions, the CM said that nobody can be induced to convert as “service” was without caste, religion etc. He said that the Opposition was not realising that something anti-national, anti-Hindu was taking place which would create trouble for security and religious demography. “If your name is Ashraf, then don’t become Anil. Don’t create doubt by using Hindu names. First they fool you and then carry out love jihad and therefore we have come up with a strict law. Chhatisgarh and Rajasthan governments should be aware of this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-guilty-wont-be-spared-but-arrest-only-on-the-basis-of-proof/articleshow/86884335.cms||---

He joined the ruling party in the presence of Union minister Smriti Irani, Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni and state president Madan Kaushik. Kaira is the third serving MLA to jump into the saffron camp ahead of the assembly polls. Before this, Congress MLA from Purola, Rajkumar, and independent MLA from Dhanaulti, Pritam Singh Panwar, have already joined the BJP. Welcoming Kaira in the party fold, Smriti Irani said, “It’s a great moment for the party and I hope that Ram Singh Kaira will take forward the government's policy at the ground level in Uttarakhand.” She also said that the party will benefit from his induction as Kaira is a grassroot leader. Ram Singh Kaira, 37, had contested from the Bhimtal seat on a Congress ticket in 2012 and lost. In the next assembly polls in 2017, when he was denied a ticket by Congress, he left the party and contested as an independent candidate and won the seat.

The collective target for the division is vaccinating 2.5 lakh citizens, per day, until October 14,” said Gandal. The districts currently administer vaccines at the rate of about 1.50 lakh, per day, across the region. If smaller districts, like Dhule, can cross the 80,000-mark, then districts like Ahmednagar and Nashik can also cross the 1 lakh-mark. “All districts have the potential to vaccinate a large number of citizens per day. The issue has been about availability of vaccine as well as syringes. Now, both are available and so we will take up massive vaccination drive in the region,” Gandal explained. According to the officer, there are 7 lakh vaccine doses in reserve with the health authorities across Nashik division and the state has assured regular supply of vaccines and syringes.

The status report speaks about the notice issued to the named accused, Ashish Mishra, who was asked to appear before the police at Reserve Police Lines at 10am on Friday (October 8) for recording of his statement. The report also provides details about the health condition of the mother of one of the slain farmers, Lovepreet Singh, as the apex court had directed the government to ensure proper medical care to her. The other parts of the status report comprise of two FIRs, their translation and copy of the formation of the judicial commission and the measures taken by the government to ensure law and order in Kheri. The report opens with the medical condition of Lovepreet’s mother, Satwinder Kaur. The report says that the CMO of Lakhimpur Kheri sent an ambulance and a medical team to her residence in Chaukada Farm, Pallia, in Kheri on October 6. However, the family members told the team that a private doctor was checking her and they refused to send her to the hospital or allow the medical team to treat her. Acting on the court’s order, a medical team reached Lovpreet’s house again the next day following which Satwinder Kaur was examined by the medical superintendent, CHC, Pallia. She was diagnosed with mild weakness and post-traumatic stress, and was advised treatment. The next part of the report talks about the steps taken by the state after the incident. According to the report, two FIRs were lodged on October 4. The first FIR was lodged by one Jagjit Singh against Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unknown people in connection with the death of four farmers – Lovepreet Singh, Nakshatra Singh, Daljeet Singh and Gurwinder Singh –under charges of murder, rioting, rioting with armed weapons, rash driving and others. The report said Ashish Mishra had been issued a notice to appear before the Crime Branch in Kheri on October 8.

A combined team of senior doctors and specialists from Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute went to Bahraich to conduct a second postmortem examination of one of the farmers, Gurvinder Singh, on October 5 under videography. The cremation of all the four farmers was carried out with due respect and in a peaceful atmosphere, the report says, adding that the families of the deceased farmers have been given the compensation of Rs 45 lakh each. The report says that a special investigation supervisory team (SIT) has been constituted under a DIG rank officer to ensure an unbiased and transparent investigation into the two FIRs. The state has also asked people to contact the helpline number and email publicized in the media to help in the probe. The report says that the government has constituted a single-member judicial commission under retired Allahabad high court judge Pradeep Kumar Srivastava to probe the incident. In the report, the government has also mentioned the status of the PIL filed before the Allahabad high court.

---||Ahmedabad||Panchayat member’s arrest: Gujarat high court orders fresh elections||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday quashed the Satalasana taluka panchayat elections and ordered to hold fresh elections in four weeks after a panchayat member of the Congress party was arrested a few minutes ahead of polling after registration of an FIR in an eight-year-old case. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati was upset with the arrest of panchayat member Vasantbhai Joshi on March 17 from outside the panchayat building, where he had gone to cast his vote. The Congress had eight members and BJP had a strength of seven and there was one independent member in the taluka panchayat. The FIR was lodged by a former milk cooperative chairperson on March 16 for alleged siphoning of funds by Joshi in 2012. Since Joshi could not cast his vote, the BJP won the elections. The HC said that this is a gross abuse of power. On this, the high court said, “Today, if we turn a blind eye to what has been brought to our notice, tomorrow, the same thing may be repeated with impunity. We don’t want such acts in total defiance of the procedural requirement of the democratic process of holding the election to precipitate. At the end of the day, the ‘Rule of Law’ must prevail.” To set things right, the judges went on to say, “The power of judiciary lies not in deciding cases, nor in imposing sentences, nor in punishing for contempt, but in the trust, confidence and faith of the common man. We don’t want a common man to lose faith and confidence in the judiciary but rather we should instil confidence and faith by condemning the act and setting it right.” It further said, “As such, casting of vote decides the fate of a country, inasmuch as the ruling of it entrusted in the hands of a set of persons in whose hands, in turn the basic feature of the Constitution, namely the protection of the democratic set up is ultimately invested.” On denial of voting opportunity to Joshi on pretext of his arrest, the HC said, “…infringement of such a right will certainly call for the intervention of this court in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under the Constitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panchayat-members-arrest-hc-orders-fresh-elections/articleshow/86879590.cms||---

Amit alias Bhola, a resident of Gurgaon, was arrested when a special team of Bhiwadi police intercepted his movement in the region. Police said that the accused sustained a firearm wound on his leg and his condition is stable. The accused was part of an inter-state gang that operates in regions close to the Rajasthan-Haryana border. SP, Bhiwadi Ram Murti Joshi said that police teams were already on alert following incidents of firing at a bakery and scrap dealer. A pistol was also recovered from him. As per Bhiwadi police, a team was patrolling the area when they spotted two suspects moving around the city. A police party asked them to stop when the suspects fled on a bike. Cops chased them before their bike skidded and the two suspects fled. The suspects also fired at the police. The team responded and fired around four rounds. While one of the suspects fled from the spot, cops managed to get hold of Amit who could not run after a bullet hit his leg. Bhiwadi police said that another team was constituted to look for the second suspect who is absconding. “Amit was wanted in two firing and extortion cases. He is a notorious criminal who was moving about the Bhiwadi region, possibly plotting another criminal scheme,” an official said. Local police have also alerted all police stations around the inter-state borders to look out for the absconding gunman. “These criminals frequently shuttle between Rajasthan and Haryana to evade police teams of both states.

---||Delhi||...AAP says civic body wanted to pass resolution to sell properties in E Delhi||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, attacked the BJP-run East Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday for allegedly trying to sell civic properties by moving a proposal in a special House meeting. Pathak also thanked Delhi High Court for allowing AAP’s suspended councillors to participate in the meeting that was scheduled to discuss the issue of dengue and other vector-borne diseases. He claimed that BJP was bringing in a proposal in this special session to avoid any protest. “They called the session to bring a proposal to sell properties. This means that their end goal was to pass the Bill silently. AAP went to the high court regarding this issue,” he said. At least 12 AAP councillors and eight nominated members were suspended for 15 days in the last House meeting by the mayor for alleged misconduct. “BJP has made Delhi dirty all around. When our councillors attempted to ask questions, they were suspended,” Pathak alleged. Reacting to the property sale allegation, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Pathak’s statement was nothing but an assumption to malign the BJP-run civic bodies. He claimed the AAP councillors were suspended due to their misconduct and had nothing to do with the agenda of any future session. “Before making allegations, Durgesh Pathak should have confirmed the ensuing meetings’ agenda as no sale or lease of property is scheduled in them,” he said.

The owner of the house in the residential colony put up illegal construction, which obstructed the road also. The members of the society objected to the illegal construction. When the issue reached AMC, the authorities in 2016 said that the owner could file an application for regularisation of the construction and the part, which cannot be regularised under the GDCR norms, would have to be removed.

The Corporation shall ensure that this offending part of construction is demolished within 48 hours, failing which, we shall hold the corporation responsible for the same.” The HC has also asked for a report from the AMC about the demolition, said advocate Chirag Prajapati who is involved in the litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-demolition-of-illegal-structure/articleshow/86879583.cms||---

The message read, “Medicine called Imitinef Mercilet cures blood cancer and is available for free in a hospital in Pune.” When scrutinized by TOI’s Times Verified expert panel, the message was found to be fake. In fact, it was found that messages on similar lines were being circulated in different cities, with a hospital from the respective city being listed as the provider of the free medicine. When contacted, haematologist Samir Melinkeri confirmed that it was a spam message emerging every few years. Further scrutiny revealed that the message first emerged in 2010 and has been going viral every few years since then. In a TOI report published in 2015, Dr Vishal Rao, consultant, head and neck surgery, HCG Cancer Care in Karnataka, clarified that there was no single medicine available anywhere in the world, which could be prescribe for all types of cancers. At a press conference on Imitinef Mercilet, Dr Rao had then said, “We don’t know who are spreading such rumours. People are coming to us and inquiring about it. In allopathic medical system, we only prescribe evidence-based medicine which cures the disease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/miracle-drug-for-blood-cancer-just-a-hoax-experts/articleshow/86879552.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Meghalaya govt to relocate Sikhs from Shillong’s Punjabi Lane||Shillong: There seems to be no resolution in sight to the land dispute between Sikh residents of Punjabi Lane, the epicentre of Shillong race riots in 2018, and the Meghalaya government after the state cabinet announced its decision to take possession of the Harijan Colony, or the Sweepers’ Colony, within a week. The Meghalaya cabinet, based on the recommendation of the high-level committee (HLC) on Thursday decided to go ahead and relocate the Sikhs, described as “illegal settlers” of Punjabi Lane in Them Iew Mawlong area of Shillong. Chief minister Conrad K Sangma said that the HLC had recommended the urban affairs department to find a suitable location for relocation of people who reside in the area as those serving with the state government will be relocated to the official quarters of the concerned departments. The 350-odd Sikh families living at Iewduh (Punjabi Lane) have been fighting eviction from the land where they have been living for over two centuries. The land, they claim, was donated by a Khasi tribal chieftain to them before 1863. The Conrad Sangma government in June 2018 had announced setting up of a high-level committee to settle the land dispute. Violence had erupted in Shillong on May 31 that year after an altercation between a few women from Punjabi Lane area and a city bus driver and conductor spiralled out of control. Rumours circulated on social media had also fuelled mob fury. The Harijan Panchayat Committee (HPC), which represents the residents of Punjabi Lane, rejected the HLC report on relocation. “We will fight tooth and nail and stop all illegal acts of the Meghalaya government,” HPC secretary Gurjit Singh said in a statement issued on Friday. “Challenging the recently submitted HLC report of the Conrad K Sangma-led state government on the ownership of the land of poor Sikhs at Bara Bazar, Shillong, the HPC, representing the interests of the hundreds of families living there for the past 200 years and more, have rejected the report, portions of which were revealed to the media yesterday,” the statement said. Reacting to the statement of CM Sangma that the process of taking over the land at Sweepers’ Colony, which includes a gurdwara, school and a church, will be completed within a week, Singh said, “We will fight for our rights till our last breath. We will die for our land and will not allow any illegal, unlawful, unethical and unjust action by the Meghalaya government.” “The matter is sub-judice in the Supreme Court of India and the Meghalaya government would be committing a breach of procedures if it insists on going ahead with its illegal plans,” he said. “We are the legitimate owners of the so-called disputed 2.5 acres of land, as it was gifted to our ancestors by the tribal chief Syiem of Hima Mylliem. No one else has the right to this land,” he asserted. Singh also alleged that the Meghalaya cabinet has failed to appreciate the genesis of the case, which is that poor Sikhs, who have served the state are now being made victims of forcible eviction under the pressure of land mafia and for the simple reason that the then inaccessible area is now prime property. After the cabinet meeting to discuss the recommendations of the HLC on the Sweepers’ Colony, Sangma had tweeted, “The process of signing the tripartite agreement and taking possession of the land by the govt in urban affairs dept. from the Syiem of Mylliem has started and the whole process should be completed by next week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/meghalaya-govt-to-relocate-sikhs-from-shillongs-punjabi-lane/articleshow/86879224.cms||---

Initially an attempt was made to collect information/details of vaccination percentage among parents when they came to collect ration kits, but it served a limited purpose. Later a survey was conducted and parents were contacted to verify the actual number of people who had not been vaccinated. Congress councillor Abhishek Dutt said that they took the drive seriously as “chances of children getting the infection easily during the third Covid wave was high.” “We made a scheme with the help of teachers and school heads, under which we decided to cover parents of all primary school students in my ward. About two months back, when we distributed free ration kits to the children, a survey was carried out to identify the number of SDMC schools, total children and number of parents. In the survey, it was found that only 25% of the parents were vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-for-parents-of-municipal-school-kids/articleshow/86879125.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi airport: Flight operations set to resume at T1 from October-end||NEW DELHI: As passenger footfall continues to increase, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the Delhi airport operator, on Friday announced that flight operations would resume at Terminal-1 (T1) from October 31 at 12.01 am onwards. Both SpiceJet and IndiGo will be shifting to T1, which has remained shut for nearly 18 months now. With this, all three terminals at the airport will now become fully operational. DIAL said it would continue to provide a safe and healthy environment to passengers flying in and out of the Delhi airport, with similar safety measures to be put into place at T1 as were being followed at Terminals 2 and 3. The first flight scheduled to operate from T1 after its reopening will be an IndiGo flight, which will depart from Delhi for Mumbai at 1.05 am. An airport official said during weekends, footfall in the domestic sector had touched over 1 lakh passengers per day, while during weekdays, it was hovering between 85,000 and 1 lakh passengers. In the international sector, footfall was ranging between 17,000 and 20,000 passengers. “We would like to assure passengers that at the airport, they would be in a safe and healthy environment. We have implemented several measures to ensure passenger safety without compromising their comfort and experience. Our teams have worked round-the-clock to sanitise the vast terminal,” said Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO, DIAL. Commercial operations of domestic and international flights were suspended from March 24, 2020 onwards in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. Terminal-3 was the first to reopen, on May 25, 2020, with Terminal-2 opening up in a calibrated manner from July 22, 2021 onwards. The arrangements at T1 will include six kiosks for passengers to do a web check-in before entering the terminal, while passengers will also be encouraged to use e-boarding scanners for entry to security and frisking entry points to avoid close contact or crowding. DIAL said passengers would be asked not to use seats with cross marks to ensure social distancing. They will have to wear masks mandatorily to ensure the safety of others. “Queue managers deployed at boarding and bussing gates will continuously monitor precautionary measures,” a DIAL spokesperson said, adding that sanitisation of surfaces will continue 24x7. Mumbai airport’s Terminal 1 will reopen on October 13 and its only operational T2 is currently witnessing massive rush due to passenger surge during the festive season. The winter schedule will kick in from October-end. If Covid stays under control, then the government may allow airlines to operate 100% of their pre-Covid domestic flight capacity. At the moment, airlines are allowed 85% of pre-Covid domestic capacity — the highest since the pandemic outbreak last March. Once that happens, Delhi and Mumbai will need all their terminals operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/flight-ops-set-to-resume-at-t1-from-october-end/articleshow/86879108.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Petrol in Kolkata crosses Rs 104; diesel less than Rs 5 short of century||KOLKATA: Petrol price in the city crossed the Rs 104-mark on Friday, three months after it had crossed Rs 100. It has been on an upward rise over the last two weeks with price revisions being done eight times in twelve days. Diesel price has also increased significantly and now stands at Rs 95.19, less than Rs 5 short of a century amidst volatility in the global oil prices. In Kolkata, petrol price had hit the century run across all petrol pumps on July 7 as it clocked Rs 100.29 per litre. It had a steady run for the next 11 days to reach Rs 102.14 and the price remained there till August 21 following which it started dropping and came down to Rs 101.64 on September 7. The price remained constant at this mark for the next 20 days after which the rise started again and it has now crossed Rs 104. “Once the price has crossed Rs 100, these minor changes don’t affect anymore. I had never felt any relief because of the one-rupee price fall but now that the price has started to increase steadily again, I wonder if it will cross the Rs 120-mark by the end of this year. That will certainly hurt us,” said Subhadeep Mitra, who has started riding his bike more often these days keeping his car in the garage to save on fuel cost. Fuel prices in the country have been hovering at record levels on account of 41 increases in its retail rates since April this year. It fell on a few occasions but largely remained stable. Petrol prices had maintained stability between September 6 and September 27 but oil companies finally raised its pump prices last week given a spurt in the product prices lately. Petrol prices have also risen on six of the previous eight days. OMCs had preferred to maintain their watch on global oil situations before making any revision in prices. This is the reason why petrol prices were not revised for the last three weeks. But extreme volatility in global oil price movement has now pushed OMCs to effect the increase. Benchmark Brent crude oil is trading at over $82 per barrel. When the price had crossed Rs100, the Brent crude was selling at $76.20 per barrel and at the start of the year it was about $51.80 per barrel. Sources at an oil PSU suggested the price of crude oil can rise further up to $90 per barrel by December which will certainly lead to further increase in fuel prices in Kolkata as well as the rest of the country. Petrol pump owners’ association has demanded the Centre and state to reduce taxes that constitute over 55% of total price paid for a litre of petrol. “There has been a steady fall in oil consumption by motorists after the constant price rise. Considering a zero tax situation, we can sell petrol at Rs 44 per litre. The Centre and state should seriously consider reducing the tax components else our country will head towards an overall rise in inflation,” said Snehasish Bhowmik, vice president, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-in-kol-crosses-rs-104-diesel-less-than-rs-5-short-of-century/articleshow/86879635.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||Delhi: Epic show to remain muted as Covid leela not over yet||NEW DELHI: The Ramlilas haven’t been blacked out by Covid-19 this year. But the usually grand, nine-day re-enactment of the Ramayana will be mostly symbolic. From digital Ravana dahans to restricted participation of people and truncated celebrations, Ramlila organisers are trying to make the best of the situation. Delhi Disaster Management Authority may have given permission for the holding of the Dussehra event but has placed restrictions like no fireworks, no crowding, not fetes and rides, etc. Accordingly, Nav Shri Keshav Ramleela Committee, Rohini, will organise events on October 13-14, Sri Ramlila Committee, Indraprastha, on October 11-15 and Dharmic Leela Committee on October 8 at Iskcon Temple instead of the regular Red Fort grounds. Dwarka Shriramlila Committee is one of the organisers that has no plans to stage the mythology performances this year, only burn Ravana’s effigy on October 15. Last year, the committee held the event online but the lack of viewer interest dissuaded it from taking the risk this year. Sri Ramlila Committee, which organises the event at Ramlila Maidan every year, too is foregoing the opportunity this year because the ground has been turned into a Covid care facility. Promod Aggarwal, treasurer of Sri Ramlila Committee, Indraprastha, said it will organise the annual event at Ipex Bhawan because permission for the original venue hasn’t been received even till this late juncture. “For the convenience of people, we will install two huge LED screens outside the premises to show the digital Ravana dahan,” said Aggarwal. Rajesh Gahlot, former MLA and member of Dwarka Shriramlila Committee, reasoned, “When melas and food stalls aren’t permitted and only 200 people are allowed to participate, there is no point in spending too much on arrangements. After clarity on DDMA’s guidelines, we will decide whether we will organise the burning of the effigies.” Nav Shri Keshav Ramleela Committee in Rohini will have the Ramlila only on two days. On October 13, it will have the kavi sammelan and the following day stage the entire Ramayana in three hours. “Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra artistes will perform and around 600 members and their families will be allowed into the venue,” said Pushpendra Rastogi, committee chairman. It may also go digital with the Ravana dahan. Lav Kush Ramlila Committee is among the few organisers firm on continuing till October 16. “We will close the gates once 600 people have entered the venue,” said secretary Arjun Kumar. “We are hoping for some liberty in erecting the effigies.” The residents’ welfare associations are also uncertain. HS Bhalla, president of Western Avenue RWA at Sainik Farms, which organises a digital, 45-minute Ramlila in the colony every year, said, “Last year we couldn’t plan anything but this year we have sought permission for the event.” The Lajpat Nagar II RWA plans a laser show on the Ramayana, digital burning of effigies and street plays by colony children over an hour at the C Block park. “But things are unclear and we will take a final decision in a couple of days,” said Ashwani Marwah, secretary, Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/epic-show-to-remain-muted-as-covid-leela-not-over-yet/articleshow/86879397.cms||Vibha Sharma

During a meeting of the monitoring committee set up under PMEGP, he also pointed out that while loans of 3,267 units have been approved, release of their margin money is pending. He said that decision on another 7,720 applications is pending and has asked banks to clear all claims by October 31. “Set up camps across the state and clear all loan applications. In 2020-21, PMEGP scheme margin distribution was 127% more than the target and this year too we will over achieve by 150%. Under the scheme, 9,954 units were established and Rs 327.91 crore was given as margin money. This year, 11,069 units will get Rs 334.35 crore as margin money. So far 37% has been distributed. Due to shortcomings at the banks, claims worth Rs 15.38 crore of 501 units are pending,” Sehgal said. He said that units established under PMEGP between 2017-17 and 2019-20 should be geo-tagged and verified on ground.

Brijesh Singh, circle officer (CO) of Meerut field unit, UP STF, said, “As of now, 20 cases are registered against Naveen Malik, out of which 10 are of murder. There are many more in which his name was not mentioned because of his fear among people. But now that he is in our custody, many more cases will be looked into, including the disappearance of a young woman. He allegedly choked her to death and threw the body in the canal, though the body was never recovered.” Singh said, “His style of working has attracted a lot of youngsters into his gang. Around 150 followers accompany him in and around the village and he calls this gang ‘Gadar’.” Malik, 27, also runs a YouTube channel and recklessly flaunts weapons in all the videos, nicknaming himself ‘NaveenMalikAK47’. Sources in STF said that Naveen allegedly killed a lot of his victims by drowning them. In 2019, Naveen and his gang members allegedly drowned three men of their village in a tube-well reservoir due to an old rivalry in Muzaffarnagar. They later put the bodies in an SUV and pushed it into a Ganga canal, trying to make it look like an accident. But police cracked the case, Naveen was booked for the murders and sent to jail. He had come out on bail last year and was missing since then. In his home town Sonipat, he had allegedly killed a Rohtak youth by forcibly drowning him in a bucket of water. He had dumped the body in a drain in Noida’s Knowledge Park. Haryana Police had declared a reward of Rs 50,000 on any information leading to his arrest. Apart from murders, he has also been involved in abduction and extortion. In August 2020, he allegedly abducted an official of construction firm Larsen & Toubro (L&T).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/haryana-gangster-notorious-for-drowning-his-victims-nabbed-from-noida/articleshow/86876797.cms||Sandeep Rai

Earlier, the number of online pass booking were limited to 700. As many as 10,000 devotees took the darshan on the first day of Navaratra on Thursday. Around 16,000-17,000 devotees visited the Mahalaxmi temple on Friday. Secretary of Paschim Maharashta Devasthan Samiti Shivraj Naikawde said, “The crowd is manageable and hence we have increased the darshan slots to 1,000 devotees per hour. The slots for the first three days were already full and on Saturday, the slots for next three days will be opened for online bookings. On Thursday, when the temple reopened after many months, over 10,000 devotees took the darshan, whereas on Friday, around 16,000 devotees are expected to take darshan till 9 pm. Depending on the crowding, the temple authorities will increase the slots if required. On Friday, the idol of goddesses Mahalaxmi was created in the form of 'Maheshwari Matruka' wherein the idol was shown sitting over a Nandi. Priest in the temple Arun Munishwar, Soham Munishwar and Sukrut Munishwar created the goddess idol on Friday. The devotees were allowed in the darshan queue only after undergoing the thermal screening, sanitisation and checking the QR code of the online darshan pass at the checking counter at Chhatrapati Shivaji chowk and near MLG high school. Owing to the incessant showers on Friday evening, the devotees in the darshan line and in the temple premises faced much inconvenience. As the rainfall increased, the darshan line was almost empty towards late evening. The nine-day festival sees devotees coming to Kolhapur from different parts of the state of darshan of the Goddess. Last year, the temple was shut during the festive period owing to the Covid pandemic. Government has now allowed temples to open with strict protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/more-slots-for-online-booking-from-today-for-mahalaxmi-visit/articleshow/86874635.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Meerut||Meerut bizman suicide: Father held for murder bid on wife of deceased||Meerut: In a twist to Meerut businessman Amit Bansal and his wife Pinky Bansal’s suicide case, city police has now booked Amit’s father for attempting to murder Pinky. On receiving a complaint from Pinky’s family, police filed an FIR against Ramkishan Bansal. They also managed to get CCTV footage substantiating his act. According to cops, Ramkishan Bansal, an advocate, slashed his daughter-in-law Pinky’s neck in front of her 7-months-old daughter. He took this extreme step as he believed Pinky to be the reason behind the death of his son, who ended life by hanging himself from a ceiling fan. Notably, Ramkishan was the one who had called police after the crime took place on Monday evening. He even told cops that his son had killed himself and after seeing his body, Pinky slashed her neck and wrist to kill herself. The theory seemed convincing enough as Ramkishan had just lost his son and there was no evidence against him at that moment. Also, Pinky was unconscious and could not elaborate the events of the day. “We were convinced it’s a case of suicide, but later we found that the major part of the CCTV footage was hazy. We then formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the matter. The team tried to make the footage clearer by using some special software, post which we found that it is true that Pinky had slashed her wrist after seeing Amit’s body, but she was later thrashed by her father-in-law who used the same cutter to slash her wrist. We also found that her mother-in-law was present on the spot, but didn’t make any attempt to stop her husband,” said SP (city) Vineet Bhatnagar. While the family cremated Amit Bansal on Tuesday, Pinky Bansal is still battling for her life in the ICU of a Noida hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-bizman-suicide-father-held-for-murder-bid-on-wife-of-deceased/articleshow/86876845.cms||Ishita Mishra

Gupta’s wife, Meenakshi, alleged on Friday the footage was damning evidence that her husband was murdered by police inside the hotel room. “I want all killer cops to be put behind bars,” she told reporters. Meenakshi also charged police with unnecessary delay in taking her husband to hospital. Gupta died under mysterious circumstances during a police verification exercise in a Gorakhpur hotel on September 28. Two hotel CCTV grabs, each of 9 and 14 seconds, which went viral on social media late Thursday also expose the callous and insensitive handling of an emergency by cops. Another CCTV video shows police taking Gupta to a private hospital, where doctors refuse to admit him. Two hours later, he was taken to a government hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The probe, which is now with Special Investigation Team of Kanpur police, will also scan footage of the night of the police raid.

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Elderly pilgrim climbs Pavagadh hill on cops’ arms||VADODARA: When an octogenarian woman wanted to go to the Mahakali Mata temple on the Pavagadh hill, it was two policeman who carried her in their arms to the temple. The woman had left her home in Madhya Pradesh to visit the temple in Pavagadh without informing anyone. Pavitra Harirao Jadhav, a resident of Sendhwa in Barwani district of Madhya Pradesh, was spotted alone by policemen on duty for Navratri at Pavagadh. When they approached her, she informed them about her wish and gave details of her family. She also had a diary with phone numbers of her relatives. Initially, two Gram Rakshak Dal jawans tried to make the woman climb stairs, but were not successful. The cops even tried to ensure that the woman decides against going to the temple, but could not do so. Pavagadh has a ropeway to reach the temple, but one has to climb stairs both before and after taking the ropeway. On Thursday evening, a senior officer on duty at the hill spoke to constable Riyaz Bharkhani from the Halol police station and constable Ritesh Patel from the State Reserve Police (SRP) group in Godhra. The duo agreed to take the woman to the hill top. Bharkhani and Patel took turns in carrying Jadhav in their arms and ascending the hill. The duo had been on their feet since morning due to the security arrangements for Navratri, but readily accepted the task assigned to them. Bharkhani said that the woman was sitting alone since 11am. “She had categorically said that she will not return without ‘darshan’. We ensured that she visited the temple,” he added. The policemen spoke to the family of the woman and informed them about her. Her sons told the police that she had left without informing anyone. “She had mentioned that she wanted to go to Pavagadh. But we could not take her on the first day of Navratri on Thursday as we had to install the goddess at our home too. Before we could plan to take her, she left on Thursday itself without telling us,” said Kishor Jadhav, her son. Kishor informed the police about the next bus and spoke to the driver of the bus as well. “We left her safely in the bus. The bus crew offered to drop her at a place near our town. They will also make her board a bus to Sendhwa and give us the details,” Kishor said. The woman’s son said that he was indebted to the policemen. “They not only took my mother for the visit to the temple, but took good care of her too. I will be indebted to them. I plan to visit the policemen soon and thank them,” Kishor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/elderly-pilgrim-climbs-pavagadh-on-cops-arms/articleshow/86876952.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Surat||Surat: 7,000 litres toxic waste dumped in drainage line||SURAT: Investigation into the dumping of 7,000 litres of effluent by a truck in a drainage pipeline of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) in Sachin has revealed that the content was highly toxic and acidic material. The truck was seized on September 13 after which police sent the material for testing to Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and forensic science laboratory (FSL) to determine the content and based on the findings lodged a complaint in Sachin police station on Thursday. Amitkumar Patel and Arvindkumar Pal, owner and the driver of the truck, respectively, are, however, on the run. Police had booked the two residents of Ankleshwar based on a complaint lodged by Bharat Patel, an official of Sachin Udhyognagar Sahkari Mandli CETP plant. Locals saw the tanker releasing the waste in the drainage line at night and alerted the CETP officials after which the police were contacted. “Initially it was not clear what material was being dumped by the accused. We got it examined by GPCB and FSL and that confirmed that it is highly toxic material,” said K B Zala, police inspector, Sachin police station. Along with toxic chemicals, dissolves of metals like copper, nickel and cadmium were also found from the waste. Due to its highly acidic nature the liquid could have proved threatening for the life of humans or animals. “The toxic waste is dangerous for the environment. It was brought from Ankleshwar and was supposed to be delivered at some CETP instead of releasing it directly in the drainage,” said the police. Through drainage, the waste goes to the rivulet and ultimately into the river or sea. Police suspect that the accused truck owner signed a contract to dispose of the effluent from some industrial unit in Ankleshwar. “He is supposed to get the waste treated before releasing it in the open. He has to sign a contract with some CETP for treating the effluent. But to save money the accused were releasing the effluent without treating it,” cops added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/7000-litres-toxic-waste-dumped-in-drainage-line/articleshow/86877344.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation to spend Rs 8 crore again on repairing roads in Peth areas||PUNE: The civic body will spend an additional Rs8 crore in repairing roads, which had been fixed just a few months ago, in the central parts of the city (Peth areas). A few months ago, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had spent around Rs8 crore in the road repair works in the Peth areas. Major roads such as Laxmi Road, Kelkar Road and Kumthekar Road are riddled with potholes, despite being repaired just months ago. The PMC would effectively be spending twice on road repair work this monsoon. “People are facing problems while commuting. Providing good roads is necessary, so we are allowing the repairs. The funds for it have been approved recently,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee. A total of Rs12 crore has been sanctioned for the road repair work. Of which, Rs8 crore would be spent in the repair works in the Peth areas. He said an inquiry into the poor quality of roadwork was pending and that the civic administration has been directed to look into the matter. “We had informed the civic administration that the repair work was not up to standard. We sent a letter in this regard in June, but PMC paid no heed. Public funds have gone into the drain,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group. After drawing sharp criticism from commuters, corporators and activists over the poor quality of roads, the PMC had finally decided to take some corrective measures and prioritize the road repairs in July. Road digging was stopped and repairs of already dug up roads were started. “The funds from road department would be utilised for road restoration. All the necessary steps would be taken to resolve the issue,” said VG Kulkarni, the head of PMC’s road department. The PMC had allotted nearly Rs926 crore for road construction and maintenance in the municipal budget for 2021-2022. Nearly 115km roads have been dug up across the civic areas to lay pipelines for the 24x7 water supply project and to replace the old drainage lines. As a special project, these works were conducted even after the regular deadline for the same was over on May 31.Major works were carried out in the Peth areas. The lines in the old city areas were to be replaced after around six decades. The initiative has been taken to improve, the water supply in these areas. Even the works related to the Metro rail are going on at the same time. All this has led to the increase in road digging. Elected members of the opposition said the civic body should have taken timely steps to complete the road digging works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-spend-rs-8cr-again-on-repairing-roads-in-peth-areas/articleshow/86879343.cms||---

Asserting there was no shame sweeping the floor, Priyanka Gandhi spent time with the sweeper community. “There is nothing wrong in cleaning the floor. Scores of women and sewage staff do it every day. It is a matter of pride, exemplifies the desire to serve and stay humble,” Priyanka said after sweeping the floor of the Valmiki Ashram. Later talking to reporters, she said: “The chief minister’s comment smacks of his disregard for Dalits. Congress will not tolerate this attitude.” Earlier, responding to a query on a viral video of Priyanka Gandhi sweeping the room of a PAC guesthouse in Sitapur during detention, the CM said, “Janata unko isi layak banana chahti hai (people want to make her capable of doing such tasks).” Taking offence to the CM’s jibe, Congress workers decided to lodge their protest. But instead of letting them demonstrate or raise slogans, Priyanka reportedly told the cadre to join her at Lavkush Nagar slums, where the sweeper community resides. Priyanka reached the place around 4 pm and was greeted by elders. They took her to the Valmiki Ashram, where she offered floral tributes to the saint’s idol. Thereafter, she apprised the women folk how the CM mocked her for sweeping the floor in Sitapur. Later taking cue from their leader, Congress workers also started cleaning the place where ever they could.

Mahato parked his bike and found that he was bleeding. He was rushed to a local hospital for treatment,” said a traffic cop.

---||Kolhapur||Govt provides Rs 146.5cr for crop damage due to floods in S Maha||Kolhapur: The wait of farmers from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts to get the compensation for the crops damaged due to floods is finally over. The state government has released the compensation to the respective district collectors. For Kolhapur, Rs 85.70 crore have been released, Rs 52.75 crore for Sangli and Rs 8.01 crore for Satara. Crops over 1.5 lakh hectares were damaged in these three districts due to the flood in July. The government order mentions that the compensation amount has been calculated as per state disaster response fund (SDRF) criteria. Large tracts of sugar cane, vegetable and fruit crops were damaged in these districts. The farmers’ leaders and farmers are upset with the government for not accepting their demand for compensation as per the policy adopted by the state government after 2019 floods. The then BJP-led government had granted the compensation triple that of the SDRF rules for the farmers without loan. Also the crop loans of the farmers were waived. Farmers’ leader Raju Shetti had steered an agitation in August and September demanding compensation as per 2019 policy and total crop loan waiver. He had also saged protests and even walked along the Panchganga river to get Jal Samadhi at Narsinhawadi confluence, where he was obstructed and got a message from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to arrive for discussion. “This is sheer betrayal of the farmers. The release of compensation amount was delayed. The amount has come after two and half months of floods. During this period, the farmers, who lost their livelihood, have gone through severe pain. I was right when I hit the streets. I was aware that the MVA government is going to put just a penny in the hands of the farmers for their loss.” He claimed that the the compensation approved is less than the actual estimates the district agriculture department had worked out. For instance, Kolhapur administration had estimated loss of Rs 95 crore to the crop and farm lands. Kolhapur’s agriculture superintendent Dyandeo Wakure said, “Earlier, we received around Rs 3.5 crore for compensating damage to farm land. So far, around Rs 90 crore have been received. We expect the rest of the amount to be released soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/govt-provides-rs-146-5cr-for-crop-damage-due-to-floods-in-s-maha/articleshow/86874725.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Corbett stays: Won’t rename nat'l park, it will hit tourism: U’khand forest min||Dehradun: Uttarakhand forest minister Harak Singh Rawat on Friday said there were no plans to rename the iconic Corbett National Park — named after naturalist Jim Corbett — as Ramganga National Park. The idea had faced backlash from conservationists after the Union minister of state for environment and forests Ashwini Kumar Choubey had suggested renaming Corbett as Ramganga. “Corbett’s name will not change. There is no such proposal by the state government. We are not in its favour. The park is named after a legendary hunter-turned-conservationist. Why should we change it when the park has already established its identity all over the world with this name?” said the forest minister. Rawat said he was not present when Choubey had suggested the name-changing exercise on October 3 during his visit to the park. “A name change will hit tourism in Uttarakhand as the park is popular, including among international tourists, as Corbett,” he added. TOI had reported that during the Union minister’s visit, he had used the name ‘Ramganga National Park’ for Corbett while writing in the visitor’s book. He had also sought a proposal from park authorities to restore Corbett’s old name, Ramganga. Sources said the minister had suggested an “Indian” name for the park "in spirit of the programme — Azadi ka Mahotsav — which he was attending there". Between 1954 to 1956, the tiger reserve was called 'Ramganga National Park’ — after the Ramganga river that flows through it — before it was renamed in a tribute to Corbett. When the park was first set up in 1936, it was known as Malcolm Hailey Park after the first Lt Governor of the United Provinces. The authorities had then said they would first discuss the idea and draft a proposal in this regard. Rawat, however, said the idea of an Indian name was “fine, but not feasible”. “Corbett is not just a national park, but almost like an institution. There is endless infrastructure, foundations and books derived from its name,” said the minister. Conservationists, who had questioned the “futile” exercise and the need to obliterate Jim Corbett’s legacy, welcomed the decision. “Jim Corbett’s contribution to Kumaon is immense and goes beyond that by any hunter or conservationist. It is good that Uttarakhand has decided not to rename Corbett,” Kumaon-based historian and Padma Shri recipient Shekhar Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/corbett-stays-wont-rename-natl-park-it-will-hit-tourism-ukhand-forest-min/articleshow/86876996.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Maharashtra: As malls bounce back, small cities ripe for the picking||PUNE: Commercial real estate observers said around 45 lakh square feet of mall space could be added to the Indian market this year. The mall segment, which has been battered for more than a year by the effects of the pandemic, is increasingly focusing on untapped, secondary markets across Maharashtra, as well as the rest of the country. The new addition, real estate consultant Anarock noted, was still significantly less that the 85 lakh square feet added in 2019, with most of the new additions being projects delayed or held back due to labour shortages and severe restrictions on retail — and the adverse economic climate — brought about by the pandemic. However, with organised retail spaces like malls and shopping centres being allowed to open in most jurisdictions, including the state, about a month ago, industry bodies see some green shoots in a sector affected by both waves of the pandemic, and still operating under some restrictions. “A lot of projects across Maharashtra and the rest of the country had stalled earlier and are now being completed. Malls have been operational now for around four to six weeks, and demand is picking up again. We feel the worst is now over. And the demand for new mall space is not limited to just large cities,” Mukesh Kumar, chairman of the Shopping Centres Association of India, said. The Anarock report noted while most of the space will be added in Tier-I cities, around 15% of the new malls are also expected to be available in Tier-II and III cities. It also noted that the penetration of organised retail is only around 10% in India, compared to mid-80s in the United Kingdom and the United States. Other observers said developers and investors were betting on the large and untapped market in secondary cities due to lower costs. “Malls have recovered around 80% of their pre-pandemic business. Many are happy at the rebound. Developers of malls, as well as retailers, have realized that Tier-II, III and IV cities are better for opening new stores – the market in those cities is untapped, and the population is aspirational. We are seeing new mall developments and deals not only in cities such as Aurangabad and Nashik, but also Jalna in recent weeks,” Shubhranshu Pani, managing director of retail, JLL India, said. Pani, however, added that stumbling blocks remain for mall expansions in secondary and untapped markets, such as lower population, a lack of patience among investors, as well as differing consumption patterns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-malls-bounce-back-small-cities-ripe-for-the-picking/articleshow/86879038.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Preparations are being made by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) for this. However, the UT education department has also announced mid-term exams around this time, prompting SCERT officials to protest. Sources said officials of the two departments did not quite see eye to eye during the NSA examination and their seniors controlled the situation. Schools across the country will be ranked on the basis of NSA exam results. Meanwhile, a separate duty list of teachers has been made for mid-term examinations. A teacher said that the NSA examination officer had objected to the timing of the mid-term examinations and suggested that the exams be held after some time. Sources also said that he used objectionable language for another officer during the meeting. An SCERT official said that the national-level examination was a matter of prestige for all states and UTs but teachers and students involved in the examination would now have their attention scattered. Director, school education Palika Arora denied any unpleasantness on the issue. She said it was an administrative decision and they would work out a solution. Another official pointed out that Class III students are not going to school yet due to Covid considerations while students of classes V and VIII have been directed to take extra time to prepare for NSA exams. This examination will be conducted for the students of classes III, V, VIII and X.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/scert-ut-dont-see-eye-to-eye-on-nsa-examinations/articleshow/86877047.cms||---

At a meeting here on Friday, the alliance decided to ask workers and leaders at the local level to monitor the protest against the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh in which eight people, including protesting farmers, died. “The party workers of the three parties will be asked to urge people to participate in the bandh. The incident in Uttar Pradesh is a crime against humanity. It must be strongly condemned,” said Ramesh Bagwe, the city unit chief of the Congress. “We are appealing to traders, shopkeepers and other people to stop their day’s work. They should keep their business places shut,” said Prashant Jagtap, the city unit chief of the NCP. The alliance leaders said transporter unions, autorickshaw unions, labour unions, hawker unions, vegetable trader unions have given their support to the closure. On Wednesday, the state cabinet passed a resolution expressing regret over the death of farmers and ministers stood in silence as a mark of respect. Three cars, including one linked to a Union minister, allegedly drove into a group of marching peasants, killing four.

The preliminary probe has revealed that the accused belong to an inter-state gang of marijuana suppliers spread across the country. The accused, identified as Lau Amma Aarli (40) and her subordinates Manayya Pille (30) and Govinda Aarli (39), are residents of Todva in Nalankapilli, Visakhapatnam. The police have roped in a translator, as the accused do not understand Hindi or Marathi. The accused have confessed that they have made multiple trips to Aurangabad. Inspector Geeta Bagwade of the Osmanpura police station told TOI that there was specific information that the accused were using carriers to transport high quality marijuana to Aurangabad and other locations in the state. “The kingpin of the racket, systematically ropes in labour contractors and handpicks labourers, who do not understand or speak the native language,” said Bagwade. Earlier the accused would transport marijuana on mopeds by stuffing them beneath blankets, the police said. The transporters would claim to be blanket traders travelling from one location to another. However, after the crackdown of Aurangabad city police on such transporters, the suspects changed their modus operandi to transport marijuana. As per the latest modus, the transporters travel with marijuana in trains and the kingpin pays an amount of Rs 12,000 to three people against delivery of one parcel. In the latest case, the accused reached Aurangabad railway station and were about to board a rickshaw to head towards Baba Petrol Pump, when they were nabbed by the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-arrest-3-seize-40kg-marijuana/articleshow/86879264.cms||Mohammed Akhef

So far, the NMSCDCL has installed around 60 CCTVs at eight locations. An NMSCDCL official said the work on the project was stopped due to the Covid pandemic and monsoon. “The NMC has given permission to dig the roads for laying underground cables at selected locations for installation of the CCTVs,” an NMSDCL official said. “The work had stopped due to rains. But as rains are about to end, we are planning to start the cable laying work from next week,” he added. The smart city officials said they have already procured the poles from Delhi-based manufacturing companies for installation of the 800 CCTV cameras. “Earlier, the work was delayed and slowed due to the pandemic and also due to monsoon. We also faced manpower issue due to the pandemic. But situation has improved during the last few months,” a smart city official said. “We will speed up the installation work from next week and the target to complete the project will be December-end,” said officials. While the NMC administration has identified 110 locations like hospitals, gardens, water treatment plants, among others for the CCTV cams, the city police has identified 225 locations, including 47 junctions, market places and crime-prone spots across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/smart-city-body-sets-dec-deadline-for-cctv-project/articleshow/86879266.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Now, ‘Broga’ catches on among fitness enthusiasts||PUNE: Yoga has for decades now been a favoured Indian export to capture imaginations worldwide, in no small part due to its innumerable health benefits. While versions of this ancient fitness art keep evolving, the latest trend to hit the sector involves a testosterone-fuelled exercise in male bonding, aka ‘Broga’ yoga. Originally conceptualised by American yoga instructor Robert Sidoti, this form of yoga has become a hit among millennial men for being low on meditation and high on machismo. “When my friend told me to join him for an online Broga session, I was curious and agreed to participate to find out what it really was. The up-tempo of Zumba, the flexibility of yoga, and the high energy of cardio were all rolled into one 30-minute session, which was quite fun,” said Rohan Patil, a 28-year-old IT professional. “The energy is quite unique when there is an all-guy gang involved in the workout. For beginners like me, there was less inhibition this way,” said 33-year-old business analyst Nishant Puri. Shweta Singh, a yoga expert, said, “The term says it all — yoga as a guide and friend for men, or as the youth today say, ‘bros’. Though it started in 2014 in the US, it began trending in India after the Covid-19 pandemic hit. This form of workout focuses on enhanced physical fitness rather than the spiritual aspect of yoga.” Physical trainer and coach Sumit Dubey said, “It is generalised that yoga classes, accessories, and clothing are marketed for women. But this form of exercise can be beneficial for all genders. Broga sessions are tailored for men, focusing on strength building poses offering more challenge, giving focus on the upper body, core, and guiding flexibility.” Fitness expert Santosh Pandey said, “Even though they may profess ‘woke’ ideas, not all men are comfortable with the undertones of spiritualism in yoga. This is where Broga yoga comes in. This workout is for every ‘body’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/now-broga-catches-on-among-fitness-enthusiasts/articleshow/86879534.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Coimbatore||Tax arrears adds to corpn’s financial woes||COIMBATORE: The city corporation has performed marginally better in property tax collection this fiscal, when it collected Rs69.96 crore in the first six months, against the total collectable tax of Rs 186.43 crore. A corporation official said this was 38% of the collectable property tax and they had collected only 37% of the target amount in the comparable period last fiscal. However, the worrying factor is the ever-accumulating tax arrears. Given the financial stress that the corporation is under, every pending rupee matters a lot. If the residents clear the arrears, the officer said it would help the civic body provide better amenities and settle the pending amount to the contractors. According to the data available with the corporation, Rs266.79 crore was pending in property tax, vacant land tax, professional tax, water charges and rental collection when the current financial year began in April. And the corporation’s performance in collecting the arrears is still dismal. Out of the Rs96.59 crore property tax arrears, the civic body has collected only Rs12.39 crore in the first half. Similarly, it has collected just Rs4.56 crore of the Rs60.18 crore due in vacant land taxes and Rs6.46 crore of the Rs40.65 crore water tax arrears. A city corporation official said, “We owe the contractors a few hundred crores and are spending every penny judiciously. Public should cooperate with us by paying the pending taxes. Presently, we are carrying out development works with the available resources on a priority basis.” He said the financial crisis was one of the reasons for them to cancel some of the projects after issuing work orders. Another corporation official said they didn’t want to take any stringent measures to collect the arrears, as many people were affected by Covid-19 pandemic. “However, people who are not affected by it should not use it as an excuse to defer payments. Various measures, such as regularisation of unapproved buildings and layouts, are being taken to improve the tax collection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tax-arrears-adds-to-corpns-financial-woes/articleshow/86879262.cms||V Devanathan

Rent from shops, complexes and other facilities is one of the main components of the non-tax revenue for the corporation.A corporation official said while the target was to collect Rs23.47 crore this fiscal in non-tax revenue, they had collected 30% of it in the first six months.

The fact is that many of them have not paid the rent for up to seven years. Now, they are citing the pandemic as an excuse. The civic body is not in a mood to entertain them.

In second instance, NMC will seal such religious premises and also penalise devotees,” municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI. The civic chief pointed out that the first critical time of Ganesh Utsav has passed well with Covid-19 cases under control. However, coronavirus cases have not yet gone away, and we are still at critical stage, Radhakrishnan pointed out, urging citizens to follow Covid-19 guidelines like using face masks strictly. He said NMC will intensify its drive to penalize violators of Covid-19 protocols. On Friday, following directives from the civic chief, NMC formed flying squads of Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) which visited several religious places to inspect whether mandatory Covid-19 protocols are being followed by the management and devotees. NDS commandant Virsen Tambe said that on Friday civic cops found rampant violations at religious places including Ganesh Tekdi, Deekshabhoomi, Meetha Neem Durgah, and Agyaram Devi temple. Most common violation was devotees and even priests moving without face masks, said Tambe. Hardly any management or staff were found checking double vaccination certificates of devotees visiting the temples. “On Friday, NDS team visited temples and other religious places and issued warnings,” said Tambe, and added that from Saturday onwards NMC will start penalizing violators. TOI randomly checked some of the shrines and also spoke to management officials regarding vaccination norms on Friday too. At Sai Mandir, one of the prominent temples of the city, the guard did not ask for any vaccination certificate to those entering the premises. Temple trust secretary Avinash Shegaonkar however said staffers are asking for a certificate, but many devotees also say they have been vaccinated but are not carrying the document. “At times it becomes difficult to turn them away from the gate. Some simply argue saying that if free moment is allowed else where, why should there be a curb at temples?” he said. Maulana Hafiz Masood of Jamat-e-Ulema-e-Hind, a body of clerics, said they have not received any orders saying that only fully vaccinated should be allowed. The crowds, though, remained thin during the Friday prayers. The clerics too are insisting people of the community should get vaccinated, said a cleric. The All Saints Cathedral, Sadar, the oldest church in the city, will open from Sunday. “The worship is normally held on Sunday, so we decided to start from that day. All the norms will be followed,” said Rajshekar Peter, secretary. The municipal commissioner, however, said assistant municipal commissioners of all 10 zones have been directed to keep monitoring religious places in their jurisdictions. “If any repeated violators are found, their premises will be sealed,” he warned. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar said he would ensure mask and social distancing norms are stringently followed. “We intend to coordinate with other agencies to enforce Covid norms at shrines and ensure devotees stick to the safety standards and protocols,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-seal-religious-places-violating-covid-19-norms-civic-chief/articleshow/86879286.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Now, doctors posted in rural health centres across the district will have to click their pictures while examining patients in OPDs and post those on the WhatsApp group of district magistrate CB Singh. The move comes following a number of complaints against the laid-back attitude of doctors. "A lot of complaints regarding absenteeism among doctors have been pouring in. It is learnt that they often come late. The step has been taken to instill discipline among them. Now on, attendance will be marked once the picture of a doctor is uploaded,” district magistrate’s office said. District magistrate said, “After receiving complaints that doctors remained absent in community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centres (PHCd) in rural areas, health department was instructed to ensure that every doctor followed the order so that the problem of late arrival or absenteeism could be sorted out.” Chief medical officer Mahaveer Singh Fojdar said, “As many as nine CHCs and 43 PHCs are operating in Muzaffarnagar. Now, every doctor, posted here, is uploading his/her picture while examining a patient on the WhatsApp group of district magistrate called DM war.” District administration has constituted 156 social media groups called DM war rooms to redress public grievances. Every department will have a separate group and a four-member IT team will handle these groups. There are two WhatsApp numbers for general public in case they have any complaint or query.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/docs-get-lesson-in-discipline-punctuality-in-muzaffarnagar/articleshow/86877122.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Due to pandemic, polls were not held last year as gatherings were banned. Now, with drop in the number of corona cases, students are demanding that elections should be held this year. Kailash Kuri, one of the students leader in Rajasthan University said, "The cases of corona are down so we think this is the right time to conduct elections. Moreover, all elections whether Panchayati Raj, municipal corporation or assembly elections are being conducted in the state. Then why not student union elections."Students protested in front of the vice-chancellor secretariat but couldn’t meet him. Rajiv Jain, vice-chancellor of the university, said, "We have no objection in conducting elections for students but the notification has to be issued by the state government. If government wants, we can conduct elections." In the name of student welfare fund, every student of Rajasthan University is charged Rs 90 for the department they are studying and Rs 110 for the University Apex. There were 33,000 regular students in the university last year and around 35,000 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-students-protest-demanding-election/articleshow/86879047.cms||---
---||Trichy||Pudukottai artefacts hint at Roman link||Trichy: The Pudukottai archaeological research forum has identified two antique objects close to the archaeological excavation site at Porpanaikottai in Pudukottai district. The research forum said that the remains of a tiled roof and conical jar throw hints of a probable trade connection with ancient Rome. After the first phase of archaeological excavation taken up by the Tamil Nadu Open University (TNOU) concluded in Porpanaikottai last month, Pudukottai archaeological research forum conducted a superficial study on the northern side of the site. During the study, the forum found remains of a tiled roof like structure and dilapidated jar like object. “The tiled roof remains look like the imbrice of Roman roof tiles. The imbrice go together with tegulae to make a proper roof structure. We cross-checked with the photo evidence available at Craven museum in England online,” said A Manikandan, research scholar, department of ancient science, Tamil University. The length and width of the tiled roof, likely made of fired brick, measures 6.2cm and 6 cm respectively. Since Porpanaikottai in the literary evidence was quoted to have had palaces and massive defence walls, the research forum opined that Roman roof tile could have been used in the royal structure, thus indicating a possible trade connect with ancient Rome. Another antique object found in the superficial study was a conical jar used to store liquids. The remains of such jars were found in Arikamedu archaeological site in Puducherry. The jars were prevalent during the period of Pallavas, researchers said. “The excavation should continue in Porpanaikottai to unearth more ancient objects to study the trade link of ancient Tamils,” Manikandan added. While the research forum claimed that remains of the conical jar as amphora, an ancient jar used to store liquid, archaeological experts said that further study is needed to substantiate the theory. Earlier in August, the excavation work had found the remains of an ancient canal-like structure on the subsurface of Porpanaikottai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pudukottai-artefacts-hint-at-roman-link/articleshow/86879293.cms||---
---||Pune||Savitribai Phule Pune University to conduct odd semester examinations after December 15||PUNE: Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will conduct its odd semester examinations for all non-first year batches after December 15, Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation at SPPU, said. The first-year batches are most likely to have delayed examinations once again as the admission process for almost all technical courses have yet to start. The priority for examinations, while scheduling will be given for final-year students. University officials said that they plan to conduct the even-semester examinations by May next year, finally bringing the haphazard academic calendar due to Covid-19 to its previous cycle. The university recently released revised academic schedules for the technical branches engineering, architecture and pharmacy for both the current semester and the next semester. For all branches, the second semester is scheduled to begin from January 3 and end latest by May 15. Kakade said, “The odd semester is expected to end by December, and hence we would be planning to conduct the semester examinations after December 15. The even semester examination will also be conducted on time in May next year so that the academic calendar is regularised for most courses. However, the examinations for the first-year students will be delayed for both semesters as their admissions have yet to happen and the entire process will take time. Once their academic calendar is decided, we will schedule the examinations accordingly.” Meanwhile, the second-semester examination for first-year law students of the 2020-21 batch which generally happens in April, has been delayed due to delay in the admission process, will now be conducted from October 18 onwards. “There is a considerable delay in the examination of law students and considering the delay in the admission process this year, there is a possibility of delay for the upcoming first year too. But the remaining years are not facing any problem as their exams are on schedule,” Kakade added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-to-conduct-odd-semester-examinations-after-december-15/articleshow/86879618.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Extra work for teachers to report symptomatic pupils||PUNE: The state government has issued guidelines for teachers on how they should react in case of Covid-19 symptomatic students found in their classes, and follow general protocols now that schools have reopened physically for Stds VIII to Std XII in urban areas and for Stds V onwards in rural areas. The teachers must check the temperature of students every morning and even during the school hours. If any symptoms develop, they should immediately alert the health centre, parent of the student and the school must further inform the education officer. In an online meeting last Friday before the eopening of schools, school education minister, Varsha Gaikwad, had said, “The schools, teachers and every stakeholder attached to the schools must take every step possible to ensure that the schools reopen safely. However, once they reopen, it will be the responsibility for all of us to ensure that the children are safe. Even if there are cases, they need to be handled well by school authorities and examples from the Hiware Bazar village on how they handled the cases in schools need to be replicated across the state.” The online discussion was organised by the Maharashtra State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT). Member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 paediatric task force, Samir Dalwai, had said that the education department must give a clear indication of the syllabus to the students and also ensure that the exams are not conducted immediately. The students should be given a minimum of two weeks to adjust after a very long gap of homeschooling, the task force member had advised. They should not be pressured with exams immediately after joining school, Dalwai added. Dalwai suggested that students should be given time to share their thoughts, mingle around, meet and greet their friends and give them their own time to adjust. Zilla parishad teacher Bapu Surve said that they had received a set of instructions from the education department to ensure that the students are in good health. “We are checking the well-being of the students every day. At present, the attendance is about 60% so we are able to manage it, but later, when the attendance improves, then we will require extra time for temperature check and to follow other protocols.” Ashwini Jadhav from Indapur whose 13-year old daughter is studying in the Savitribai Phule Madhyamik Vidyalaya, said that they had full confidence in the teachers and the school staff and had decided to send their daughter to school from day one. “The school and teachers are following all the norms set by the government and we are also taking care at home. We have decided not to participate in any social gatherings so that we are not infected by the virus and our daughter is able to attend school regularly,” she said. Management committee member at a Pune Municipal Corporation school in Chandannagar, Rajendra Jadhav, said that they have a tie-up with the nearest hospital as per the guidelines issued by the government. “So far, we are doing well and the students have also responded well. We are conducting a daily temperature check when students enter the classroom. We are doing all to ensure that there is no gathering in numbers and their in and out timings are also well-managed without crowding as per the guidelines put out by the state government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/extra-work-for-teachers-to-report-symptomatic-pupils/articleshow/86879642.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Dehradun||This Ramlila, Ram & Hanuman must show vax document, dialogues cut to lower face time||Nainital: From allowing only fully vaccinated actors on stage to shortening dialogues to reduce conversation time between characters, Ramlilas in Uttarakhand hills, which have been held for over a century and attended by thousands of people, have devised ways to adapt their performances to cope with the pandemic. The Pauri Ramlila — recognised as one of the oldest and unique Ramlilas by the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts — has reduced the permitted capacity at its venue to half of previous years so that social distancing is maintained. The Ramlila is estimated to be attended by nearly 8,000 people each year. Gaur Shankar Thapliyal, convenor of the Ramlila, said, “Last year, we had cancelled the Ramlila because of the pandemic, but this year it’s been started with several precautions. We have made it mandatory for all actors to carry vaccination certificates while the seating arrangement has also been made in such a way that people follow social distancing norms.” The writers have decided to cut short a few dialogues between characters to shorten the time actors spend on stage. “The essence of all the conversations is being maintained, but we know the dangers of the pandemic. Therefore, some of the conversations have been cut short so that the actors do not face each for long,” Thapliyal said. The timing has also been changed so people from outside town can return home instead of having to put up in the area. “The usual time was 9.30 in the night, we have moved it to 7.30 so we can finish early,” Thapliyal said. Performances are also reviving in other parts of the state that had witnessed subdued celebrations last year. In Nainital, the Ram Sewak Sabha said they had decided to hold the Ramlila as Covid numbers have gone down. Mukesh Joshi, a member of the sabha, said masks have been made mandatory while a cap has been put on audience numbers. In Almora, meanwhile, women will take to the stage for the first time in 161 years of Ramlila's performance and play all the characters. The district will see performances by at least 50 women in two Ramlilas. While a four-day Ramlila would be organised by the Bhubaneshwar Mahadev Ramlila Committee of Karnatakakhola, another will be organised by Shri Ram Cultural Committee in Dharanaula.

A few importers have already moved in. Their presence will help the market as a whole to gain prominence and buyers,” said S Venkateswaran, secretary, Anthanallur FPO (A) selling vegetables at Kallikudi. Officials are planning to complete the allotment of shops at Kallikudi market by November.  Since the market has a 2,000T cold storage facility and is situated in proximity of Trichy international airport and connecting southern districts, officials said that exporters and importers were in focus. “Importers of apple fruit have applied to avail shops. Cold storage and location of the market along the NH have persuaded them to use the market as a hub for distributing the fruits,” a senior official with the agriculture department said. Kallikudi integrated market, which was intended to relocate wholesale traders from Gandhi market, was persistently ignored ever since its inauguration after several modifications in 2018. Located 15km from the existing market, traders blamed the remote location and small size of the shops. “As the new bus terminus at Panjapur is near the market and Kallikudi village will be included in Trichy Corporation, traders may reconsider their decision,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/apple-importers-eyeing-space-at-kallikudi-mkt/articleshow/86879292.cms||Deepak Karthik

Beaded embroidery, heavy mirror work attire and loaded junk jewellery is what the fashionistas are preferring for the celebration. According to shop owners in Aminabad, Nishatganj, and Alambagh, people have already made prior bookings of around 200 ‘lehengas’ (skirts) with Gujarati-Kathyawadi cut. “About 150-250 lehengas have already been booked for this year.

While some are getting traditional lehengas from Gujarat, others are mixing and matching items to get the perfect authentic lookOn top of it, decorated wooden dandiya sticks with multicoloured ribbons and ghungroos, and matching face masks are the most desired items at the shops right now,” said Vimal Sahu, owner of a dress rental shop in Nishatganj. “People are interested in buying the authentic green, yellow and red coloured scheme attires. They specially put a demand for traditional lehengas with Surat embroidery. I have ordered all my stock from Kutch to be able to serve the people with the best and authentic Gujarati costumes,” said shop owner Mohammad Shahnawaz. Hemlata Tripathi, a resident of Gomti Nagar said, “I wanted to provide cultural enrichment to my granddaughter and so got a Chaniya choli stitched for her as a traditional one. The major reason I got her a custom made set is to get a good amount of layers lining along with the wide cut frame of the lehenga,” she added. Another enthusiast, Sandhya Mishra said, “I mixed and matched several clothing items to attain a proper garba look. I’ll wear a readymade lehenga with a Gujrati multicolour jacket. The major colours in my dress are red, yellow and black.” Usha Rawat, an organiser said, “I wanted people to come out and interact with each other which I found missing in modern households ever since the pandemic hit. We are focusing on pocket friendly garba celebrations this year where I’ve invited housewives and young girls to take part. We will be renting the outfits for the same.” Ramasha Abbas, another organizer, said, ,”We are providing chaniya choli and dandiya sticks to our participants so as to reduce their stress of buying stuff for the festival.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/navratri-hues-markets-flooded-with-multi-coloured-cholis-dandiya-sticks/articleshow/86879361.cms||---

---||Delhi||SDMC’s solar push to cut power bill by 50%||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) recently completed a survey of 60 buildings, including upcoming or recently constructed puzzle/stack parking lots, at Green Park, Lajpat Nagar, Nizamuddin and Adchini where solar panels of 3MW would be installed to save 40-50% of their electricity bill. The project is a part of SDMC’s initiative to cover around 450 buildings, offices and healthcare units by March 2022 to bring down the overall electricity bill by 15-20%. A senior official said the initiative was also aimed at boosting the use of green energy. “At Lajpat Nagar and Green Park parking lots, we expect ample space and sun rays on the roof for successful operation of solar panels of 80kW and 40kW capacity, respectively, which would bring down the power bill by 50%,” added the official. “Since construction is still on at the two other sites, the exact capacity would be ascertained after their completion. Besides, dispensaries and healthcare units are among the 60 buildings on which the project would be implemented in collaboration with NVVN, a subsidiary of NTPC,” the official said. SDMC is also conducting surveys to install solar panels at surface parking lots to use the electricity for their operation as well as charging stations. Since 2018, the civic body has been working in a phased manner to cover all its complexes with solar panels. So far, around 445 complexes have either been made energy efficient or are in the process of becoming one. “In phase-I, implemented in 2018-19, we covered 208 schools and other buildings for installing panels to generate electricity up to 10MW. We earned Rs 6 crore after exporting surplus power to the grid,” said the official. In financial year 2020-21, 73 lakh units of electricity were generated by these solar panels. Once all projects become operational, they will generate around 14MW of green energy and bring down electricity consumption. “In the second phase, panels of 5kW each were installed on 177 buildings (mostly schools) through funds from the Centre. Work on 140 sites has been completed. We will generate 0.89MW electricity from these panels. Their capacity might be comparatively less, but we will cover the gap with installation of panels on 60 buildings in the third phase and generate 3MW electricity daily,” said the official. SDMC tourist spots, including the upcoming Bharat Darshan Park, have facilities for five solar trees (each of 5kW) and a plant of 84kW to meet 60% of the power requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmcs-solar-push-to-cut-power-bill-by-50/articleshow/86879124.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 307 crore cheating chargesheet against Rana Kapoor & wife||MUMBAI: The CBI has filed a chargesheet against Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu, her company Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, Gautam Thapar and his company Avantha Reality in a cheating case before a special court here on Friday. Kapoor, the then MD and CEO of Yes Bank, allegedly acquired a bungalow at Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi for Rs 378 crore in the name of his wife’s company, Bliss Abode, against its market value of Rs 550 crore from Thapar’s Avantha Realty for favouring him by granting bank loans. CBI officials said Kapoor had conspired with other accused for illegal gratification of Rs 307 crore in this transaction. The bungalow was mortgaged to Yes Bank against a Rs 400-crore loan but after the sale, Avantha did not utilise the proceeds to settle the loan. Later, the loan was declared an NPA by the bank, said the CBI. The CBI registered an FIR last year alleging that Kapoor paid a low price for the bungalow in lieu of Yes Bank relaxing the terms for existing loans to Avantha Group companies and even advancing fresh loans to them. Yes Bank had extended Rs 2,500 crore credit facilities to Avantha Group companies. In 2016, Avantha Realty took Rs 350 crore credit facility from ICICI Bank against collateral security of the bungalow after showing its valuation at Rs 550 crore. Yes Bank sanctioned Rs 400 crore loans to Avantha Realty in March 2016, although it was not eligible for loan as they already had outstanding liabilities with Yes Bank. Subsequently, Avantha Realty entered into a lease agreement of the bungalow with its group companies showing Rs 65 crore yearly rent. The agreement was allegedly executed two days before the sanctioning of the Yes Bank loan. The CBI alleged that Avantha Group increased the rent intentionally to deceive the bank to make loan approval justifiable. Avantha Realty used the money to clear the ICICI Bank loan. Kapoor helped Thapar further to extend an additional loan of Rs 1,360 crore to his other group companies during and after the acquisition of the bungalow. It was also alleged that these loans were never utilised for the purpose for which they were given and Thapar was allowed to divert the funds for evergreening of the existing loans of the group companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-307cr-cheating-chargesheet-against-rana-kapoor-wife/articleshow/86879700.cms||Vijay V Singh

Although cases of dengue and chikungunya have reduced over the last one month, the NMC health department is expecting a rise in cases due to recent rains. NMC officials said the NGO concerned has provided 100 people specially to destroy mosquito breeding spots in the city and they have already started the work. The city has reported 859 and 614 cases of dengue and chikungunya since January 1. NMC officials said they have already deployed 62 teams of health employees across the city and each team includes three employees. The teams will conduct surveys of patients, mosquito breeding spots and ensure that fogging and spraying activities are carried out regularly, said NMC officials. The civic body has started fining residents and commercial establishments responsible for creation of mosquito breeding spots. So far, NMC has collected over Rs 1 lakh as fine from 500 erring residents and commercial establishments. Moreover, NMC has introduced helpline numbers to aid residents related to dengue and chikungunya cases. Citizens may call on helpline numbers if they have patients at homes or they want to conduct spraying and fogging in their areas. According to NMC health officials, the number of positive cases of dengue and chikungunya have reduced in September and the first week of October as compared to August. This is due to various measures undertaken by the civic administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-ropes-in-ngo-to-raze-mosquito-breeding-spots-prevent-dengue-cases/articleshow/86874877.cms||Tushar Pawar

The total deaths in 2019 was 294. “There have been Covid restrictions on roads since last year. Logically, there should have been lesser accidents,” said Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra. “We have been the first force to prepare such a report in the country. This analysis helps us know what we did right and also reflects on ways we can do better,” said Mitra. Yet again, trucks and buses accounted for 44% of fatal accidents in the city. While trucks killed 47 persons in 2020, private buses killed 41. Private cars were involved in 29 cases and on 20 occasions two-wheelers killed pedestrians.

Although the rains had stopped by Thursday night, the showers resumed again on Friday morning in Deola, Niphad, Chandwad, Dindori, Sinnar and parts of Nashik taluka. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, the region will receive rain or thundershowers for the next two days — Saturday and Sunday. According to farmers, the standing kharif crops have been damaged in Deola, Chandwad, Dindori, and other talukas. Meanwhile, landslide was reported on Chinchbari ghat road in Deola taluka on Friday evening due to which the vehicular traffic was stopped by the public works department (PWD) in the ghat section. Bharat Dighole, president of Maharashtra state onion growers’ association, said rains lashed parts of Deola, Chandwad, Niphad, Dindori and Sinnar taluka of Nashik district due to which standing crops like maize, soybean and early kharif onions have been badly affected. “Some talukas received heavy rainfall, while majority of the areas in the district are yet to get adequate rains. Hence, farmers have incurred losses from both ways — due to heavy or inadequate rains,” said Dighole. Mohadi, Janori, Warwandi and other nearby villages in Dindori talukas are known for growing flowers and heavy rains in the evening impacted marigold flowers at large. “Farmers had taken to marigold on hundreds of acres in Mohadi, Janori and nearby villages in Dindori luka in view of the Navratra and Dasara. But heavy rainfall have badly damaged their farms,” Dinesh Bankar, a farmer from Mohadi village in Dindori, said.

Some organisers have planned to host Dandia and Garba events but it will be no where close to the pre-Covid festivities as several safety precautions will be in place against the pandemic virus. Event organisers said they had been flooded with queries and requests for such events during Navaratri. As a result, while dancing to groovy film and folk songs would be a possibility again, only those who are fully vaccinated can hope to get into such events. The duration too would not be like earlier when Dandia beats and frenzy continued late into the night. Usha Rawat, a resident of Gomtinagar, has decided to host a Dandia night in her society for women. She said that people had largely been confined to their homes for a year and most were vaccinated by now. Hence, a group had decided to celebrate for a few days with protocol like masks and distancing. “We will make the most of the opportunity by dressing up in traditional outfits and decorating the venue,” she said. Some hotels and cafes are also organising Dandia events but unlike previous years, no celebrity performers or artists will be coming. “Our in-house DJs will organise the music for the event on October 9. Entry will be restricted and all will be provided with costumes and masks,” said Ramasha Abbas, the organiser at a Gomtinagar cafe. At Lucknow University, a Dandia night on October 9 will be organised for students and teachers. Like every year, GD Goenka School has collaborated with a hotel for the event. “We will go big on the event this year but entry will be limited and ticketed. The event will be a perfect blend of modern and ethnic. There will be lucky draws, games and stalls of authentic cuisine,” said an organiser. However, like many other events, the famous Avadh Garba Festival stands cancelled this year too. “We get a crowd of 2,000-3,000 people. Even if we put all restrictions, it will be very difficult to check every person. Safety is paramount and therefore, we will organise the event from next year,” added Akanksha Saxena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dandia-nights-back-this-year-but-with-curbs/articleshow/86879363.cms||Aditi Singh

---||Kolkata||Beware of terror in festive season, West Bengal tells police||KOLKATA: The state internal security wing has advised utmost vigilance during Durga Puja and on Dussehra/Dashami, given a prevailing terror alert in the country. Issued late on Thursday, the missive issued by a state home department special secretary was sent to all senior IPS officers of the state, including police commissioners in Bengal, DMs and to SPs, sounding the alert. The notice also mentioned that immersion of all idols have to be completed between October 15 (Dashami) and 18, in consultation with local police stations. “In the context of the prevailing threats from divisive and terrorist groups to destabilize the country and to create law-and-order problems, you are advised to exercise utmost vigilance during the celebration of the festivals,” the statement read. It further suggested, “The community puja organizers should be asked to engage adequate numbers of volunteers in Puja pandals to keep vigil on the movement of suspicious persons and all the volunteers should be directed to keep in touch with local police constantly.” The directive further advised police to install CCTV cameras and watch towers near big Puja pandals and urged the authorities to take all possible steps to maintain communal harmony. “Special attention should be paid to areas with mixed population, thickly populated places, isolated places and vulnerable and sensitive places,” the message stressed. The notice specified the dates of immersion, too. “Organizers of community pujas should be advised to fix dates and times of immersion procession in consultation with local police stations and immersion of the idols should be done on October 15, 16, 17 and 18 only,” the message stressed. The government wants to ensure immersion is complete before October 20, which is Lakhsmi Puja, and October 19, Fateha-e-Yazdaham. The advisory from the home department also asked police to ensure the festivities did not disturb residents of the area or those from other communities, and warned against the use of microphones beyond the allowed decibel limit and specific time of the day. The directive ended with asking senior police officers to alert Nabanna about any untoward incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/beware-of-terror-in-festive-season-state-tells-police/articleshow/86879541.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Chandigarh||PGI gets country’s first bone health scanning machine||CHANDIGARH: For the first time in the country, a new machine--High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HRpQCT)--was installed in PGI’s endocrinology department on Friday. This diagnostic machine helps in early diagnosis of osteoporosis, steroid induced bone damage, bone disease in diabetes, etc. Its reports are comparable to bone biopsy. The Rs 5 crore machine will be able to forecast bone health and vulnerability to fractures by capturing more than 1,000 images in two seconds. While the exact price of the test has not been decided yet, sources estimate that it would be around Rs 500. The test report shall be given in around three to four hours. Prof Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER said, “We have HRpQCT, which is the first in the country to be operational here. As it is non-invasive, giving very less radiation and very quick results comparable to bone biopsy, which is invasive, painful and time consuming, it will open up new avenues not only in patient management but also in clinical and basic research.” Prof Sanjay Bhadada, head of the department of endocrinology said, “We plan to start a research where we will give some medicines to the patient and follow up after two weeks to see bone density etc. This will be to know if the results are absolutely similar to biopsy. Once we get a positive outcome, we can do away with bone biopsy.” He added, “Early diagnosis of bone diseases can help prevent future fractures. Furthermore, HR-pQCT can be used to monitor improvement in bone health following initiation of treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/first-bone-health-scanning-machine-in-country-installed-in-pgi/articleshow/86877250.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Nashik||Bhujbal orders use of drone for assessing crop damage||Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has asked the administration to use drones for expediting the assessment of crop damage due to the cyclone ‘Gulab’. The panchanamas of the crops are yet to be completed. The work has been affected due to the regular rainfall across the district. “Some of the MLAs present at the meeting raised the issues about incomplete panchanama of the farms affected due to cyclone or even very heavy rainfall in the district. We had a word with the collector and it has been decided that drones will be used for expediting the survey,” Bhujbal said, adding that around 84,000 hectares have been affected. MLA from Nandgaon, Suhas Kande, who was present at the meeting, said that the taluka received 126 mm of rain in three hours on September 7 and then similar heavy rainfall a fortnight later. “This caused extensive damage to the crops. At some places, the panchamas are yet to be done. I requested the administration to expedite the process,” said Kande. “The problem is that if the panchanama is conducted later, the impact of damage does not get accounted for. For instance, if there was knee deep water on the first day, and after 15 days, there is no water, what information will the panchanama carry? This is the reason that even the insurance companies are also rejecting the claims of the farmers,” he said. “In order to ensure the panchanama carries exact situation of the crop it has to be done within a stipulated period,” said Kande. The issue of insurance also came up for discussion at the meeting to which the district guardian minister said that he had taken up the issue with agriculture minister Dada Bhuse. “Only 35% of the claims presented by the farmers have been accepted and the settlement is meagre. As many as 65% of the claims have been rejected for failure of farmers about timely information to the company. We have requested the agriculture minister to take up the issue with the government,” said Bhujbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-orders-use-of-drone-for-assessing-crop-damage/articleshow/86874914.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Pune||Flight delayed by almost four hours over ‘premonition’ at Pune airport||PUNE: High drama unfolded at the city airport on Friday after the husband of a Ranchi-bound passenger claimed he had a “premonition” that something bad was going to happen to the flight. He told the staff of the airline (AirAsia), which informed the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). CISF personnel moved the aircraft to the isolation bay and thoroughly screened each passenger’s baggage before sounding the all-clear. The flight (I5-1472), scheduled to depart for Ranchi around 9am, finally took off around 1pm. The man was later arrested by police and is currently out on bail. The airline said the flight left Bengaluru and landed in Pune around 8.20am, after which it was to continue onward to Ranchi. In a statement, AirAsia said it received a verbal threat. “The man stated that he had a premonition and asked for all passengers’ baggage to be checked thoroughly. The aircraft was taken to the isolation bay and mandatory, thorough security checks were conducted,” an AirAsia spokesperson told TOI. An airport official said they decided to take this “premonition” seriously as all airports in India — especially defence airbases — were on high alert over the past few days. “As per a directive issued by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, we must take every threat, no matter how insignificant, seriously. So, we decided not to ignore this,” an airport official said. On board the waiting aircraft, there was fear, confusion, and chaos. A passenger who flew to Pune from Bengaluru said they were not allowed to deplane for an hour after it landed. “The tarmac was buzzing with officials and the fire brigade. We were deboarded and isolated in the terminal till 12.20pm. No one offered refreshments; passengers got angry and argued with officials. We could move towards the arrival gate only around 12.30pm,” the passenger, Somanna Machimda, said. According to officials in the know, the man had been acting paranoid ever since it was announced that the airport would be closed from October 15 for runway maintenance. His wife’s return flight from Ranchi was booked for October 15. “The man called the airline’s customer support several times to reschedule his wife’s return ticket, which the airlines did. However, the man remained jittery insisted on getting a copy of his wife’s boarding pass, which the airline could not issue yet,” an airport official said. On Friday, the man dropped his wife at the airport and once again demanded a copy of the boarding pass. “When he was denied again, he began to talk about his ‘premonition’ — he rattled off flight numbers, which alarmed the airline staff, who informed the CISF. Though the man didn’t use the word ‘bomb’, CISF decided to do a full security sweep,” the official said. The man was later handed over to the Airport police station, where he was arrested. “He was charged under sections 504(1) (B) (causing fear or alarming the public), section 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) and section 184 (giving false information to public servant). He was presented before a magisterial court and has been released on bail,” Kishore Jadhav, assistant commissioner of police (Yerawada division), told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flight-delayed-by-almost-4-hours-over-premonition/articleshow/86879152.cms||Joy Sengupta

Nampally police said that 40-year-old Ramesh Reddy hung himself from a shower rod during the day after he requested cops on guard to allow him to use the bathroom. On Thursday morning, an assistant sub-inspector and two constables from Rajasthan arrived in Hyderabad and arrested Ramesh for allegedly transferred Rs 7 lakh, with help from the local Meerpet police station. Around 7.30 pm, they brought him to the lodge in Nampally, but did not produce him before a concerned local court to obtain a prison transit warrant. Officials said three policemen were guarding Ramesh Reddy throughout the night by turn. “At 5.30 am on Friday, the ASI got up from sleep and used the washroom. Later, Ramesh too wanted to use the washroom. He locked the washroom from inside and as he was not coming out, the cops forced open the door and found the accused hanging,” Joint commissioner of police (central zone) Viswa Prasad said. Later Nampally police reached the spot and removed the body from the shower. “A case was registered under the charge of custodial death and a judicial magistrate was also alerted as per National Human Right Commission guidelines,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-man-kills-self-in-raj-cop-custody/articleshow/86879650.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sachin Pilot retorts to Ashok Gehlot for projecting himself next CM||JAIPUR: Ever since chief minister Ashok Gehlot alluded that he would retain the top post in state’s next Congress government as well, his former deputy Sachin Pilot has been retorting the claim. On two occasions in the past three days, Pilot has stressed that people do not stay in office forever and that he was not going to leave Rajasthan for the next 50 years. On Friday, former health minister Rajendra Chaudhary joined in by saying Gehlot projecting himself the next CM was undemocratic as it is the Congress legislature party or the high command that elects the leader. The latest round of war of words between Gehlot and Pilot started on the Gandhi Jayanti when the former publicly said he would remain active in politics for at least 15-20 years more “even if that made some people unhappy”. At the same government function held at the chief minister’s residence, Gehlot said he would reappoint Shanti Dhariwal as the minister for urban development and housing for the fourth time when the Congress government gets repeated in the 2023 state elections. “I am declaring his portfolio today itself,” Gehlot had said, implying that he too would be the chief minister for the 4th time and would be allocating portfolios. Three days later, on October 5, Pilot replied but disguised it as an attack on Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath government in the aftermath of farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri. At a government event in Tonk, Pilot said, “No one stays in office forever. As long as you give time to people, you will be in the chair. If people switch sides, the reversal is so hard that men in power would not know what hit them. Those who get besieged by pride and arrogance thinking that they will sit in power till the last stage of life, in my opinion they are wrong.” He quickly added, “Whatever happened in UP was condemnable.” Pilot made another veiled reply to Gehlot’s statement during a book launch in Jaipur on Thursday. In response to a remark, Pilot said, “I will be here for the next 50 years. I am not going anywhere. I will complete all the unfinished work.” Pilot said there was no cleverness in trying to show, round the clock, what you are not. He said, “One should be truthfully connected to the ground and live a simple life. But politics nowadays has become a hypocrisy. Some people say they are very grounded and ordinary, but the reality is something else.” Pilot further said, “Person of a ruling party should have the heart to speak up if something wrong is happening.” Gehlot’s former ministerial colleague Rajendra Chaudhary came in support of Pilot on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sachin-retorts-to-gehlot-for-projecting-himself-next-cm/articleshow/86879178.cms||---

Ashish Mishra has been accused of killing four farmers in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Sunday and was summoned by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) at 10am on Friday. More than two hours after that, he sent word to the police that he was unwell and couldn’t make it. He has been summoned again on Saturday. “Ashish Mishra did not turn up for questioning. We have issued another notice, asking him to present himself on Saturday,” DIG (headquarters) Upendra Agarwal, who is heading the SIT set up on Thursday, told TOI. “He has informed us he will appear.” In a second notice put up outside Mishra’s Lakhimpur house, UP Police said, “You were summoned to present your case before the police but you didn’t do that. You are summoned again on October 9 at 11am to the crime branch police lines at Lakhimpur Kheri. If you fail to turn up, action will be taken in keeping with due procedure.” In the afternoon, Teni landed at the Lucknow airport and told the media that Ashish would “present himself” before investigative agencies with proof of his innocence. “Phone location records will show my son was not at the spot when the incident happened,” the minister said. “If you have seen the videos from October 3, you know rioters disguised as farmers lynched people. I believe my son, too, would have been killed had he been present at the spot.” Teni, who has denied his son’s role in the Lakhimpur Kheri killings, added, “I hold such a high office. Had it been another party, not even an FIR would have been lodged.” Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who had accompanied Teni to the event at Tikunia which the farmers were protesting against on Sunday when it spiralled into violence, said, “The Lakhimpur incident is unfortunate. The guilty will not be spared. We want to assure the people of the state that at no cost will culprits be spared and no post or pressure will be of use for the accused.” On Friday morning, when Ashish’s whereabouts were not clear, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of protesting farmer organisations, had issued a statement, saying “protective tactics” were being used “to ensure that Ashish Mishra is roaming free”. It added, “News reports indicate that he is changing locations and is absconding, with several UP Police teams searching for him.” When asked why Ashish was not present on Friday morning, his counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh told the media, “Many committees have been formed. Which one issued the notice is not something I know. He has not been summoned to court. He has been summoned by a police committee.” Singh had earlier represented Teni in a murder case. While speaking about Teni’s old case, Singh added, “Ashish doesn’t have a criminal history. One or two cases registered against him are due to political rivalry.” UP Police issued numbers and a mail ID for people to share evidence related to the incident. On Friday evening, internet services were suspended in the district again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-skips-sit-summons-called-again-today/articleshow/86877333.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Lucknow||Startup incubators to come up in all govt engineering colleges||Lucknow: To promote entrepreneurial talent and provide students with a startup ecosystem, the UP government has decided to set up incubators in all 15 government engineering colleges. A sum of Rs 22.6 crore has been sanctioned for this. The institutes will recruit incubation managers to lead the centres’ activities. An innovation hub will also be established at Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University. According to technical and vocation education secretary Alok Kumar, the state government’s startup policy emphasises setting up of innovation hubs and incubators along with centres of excellence to promote startup culture in the state and create an ecosystem for innovation. Under the policy, the target is to establish 20 incubators under the technical education department. All incubators will be linked with the innovation hub coming up at AKTU on the spoke-hub model. The amount of Rs 22.6 crore, sanctioned from the State Entrance Examination Fund, is for the establishment, basic infrastructure, and operation of the 15 incubation centres in government engineering colleges and innovation hub at AKTU, Kumar said. He added that Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, has agreed to partner with the technical education department towards the orientation of the faculty in charge of these institutes. “The programme begins this month itself,” said Kumar. The 15 government engineering colleges where incubation centres will be set up include those in Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh, Bijnor, Kannauj, Mainpuri, Sonbhadra and Banda. The list also includes IET Lucknow, BIET Jhansi, UPTTI Kanpur, faculty of architecture at AKTU, Center for Advanced Studies at AKTU, UID Noida, AITH Kanpur and KNIT Sultanpur. The colleges will get assistance for the initial five years for employing necessary human resources for the execution of the work of incubators/innovation hubs and seminars, workshops, training and awareness activities, and operating machinery, hardware. One-time assistance will be available for the purchase of software and others. These centres, said Kumar, will provide complete ecosystem support to technology-based startups, where innovative ideas are generated, nurtured, and positioned for the development of sustainable enterprises. This, in turn, will offer employment opportunities to the youth. “Entrepreneurship has been one of the key focus areas of the UP government. The government is setting up incubation centres to facilitate startups in a majority of universities and colleges,” Kumar concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/startup-incubators-to-come-up-in-all-govt-engineering-colleges/articleshow/86879035.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Over 90% morning flights delayed as weekend rush clogs Mumbai airport||Mumbai: Over 90% domestic departures from Mumbai airport on Friday morning were delayed and many missed their flights due to long queues at the security points. The airport was overwhelmed by the weekend rush of passengers who jostled and struggled to reach their boarding gates on time. Social distancing was forgotten as passengers packed in thick at the security gates. Airport officials attributed the crowding to weekend rush, onset of festive season and heightened security following intelligence alerts of "threat at another airport in the state.’’ In preparation for next weekend, MIAL brought forward the reopening of terminal-1 in Vile Parle to October 13. The airport will also ask airlines to allow passengers to check in their cabin luggage to avoid delays at security handling. Said an airline source: “Weekend passengers flying out of Mumbai should reach the terminal building a minimum of two hours before departure. Even then, if they have check-in bags to deposit, they will struggle to reach the boarding gate on time.” On Friday, with many unable to reach boarding gates on time, most morning flights departed late. The few that departed on time were those scheduled before 6am such as to Goa, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Kochi, Udaipur and Kolkata. Of the 115 domestic flights scheduled from 6am to 12noon, 105 were delayed beyond 15 minutes, with most of them late by 20-30 minutes in taking off and some beyond an hour, showed data from Flightradar24, a live flight tracking app. Flight delays continued for the rest of the day, though only by an average 20-25 minutes. Arjun Vas, a passenger, tweeted: “I missed my flight this morning...Security and other airport officials doing nothing at all to regulate the people. People were breaking queue, throwing their luggage on the belt. I saw one child getting crushed by the crowds, she could barely breathe.” Music composer Vishal Dadlani tweeted: “Literally feels like we're in the dark ages. Endless milling crowds, machines breaking down, tempers frayed, chaos everywhere.” After the Covid second wave hit air travel in April-May, domestic passenger traffic at Mumbai airport resumed a speedy climb; from 6 lakh in June to 10 lakh in July and 14 lakh in August, shows Airports Authority of India data. Mumbai International Airport Ltd said “this morning, a surge in traffic due to the festive season resulted in delays...these delays were compounded due to intelligence alerts leading to heightened security measures, as well as ongoing COVID restrictions.’’ Speaking about measures put in place to prevent a repeat, MIAL said T1-Parle will reopen on October 13 with flights by Go First, followed by AirAsia India on 16 October. Among other measures are deploying additional personnel to handle passenger inflow at security gates, installing additional X-ray machines over the next four days to scan carry-on luggage and asking airlines to remind passengers to report early and allow them to check-in cabin luggage to avoid delays at security handling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-90-morning-flights-delayed-as-weekend-rush-clogs-mumbai-airport/articleshow/86879305.cms||---

In April, the suspect told the woman that he had sent her a parcel containing foreign currency as a gift. He then took money from the woman under the pretext of different charges and duped her.” When contacted, the woman told TOI, “The man cited different reasons, including payment of customs fees and an anti-money laundering certificate. I transferred the amounts in three weeks to four bank accounts. When he demanding more money, I became suspicious”.

The boat has been remaining under water for over a month. Some of them had pledged their houses and some others had borrowed money to buy the boat at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore. “Many among us had arranged our share amount by pledging documents of our houses. Now, some of us are facing an appropriation threat from banks due to default in payment. Despite this, all of us are chipping in whatever money we can to salvage the boat. Though we have sought help from various authorities, we are yet to get any positive response,” said Sunil, one of the fishermen who spent money to buy the boat. St Antony is one of the four boats, including a wooden one, that had recently sunk near the estuary of the Vembanad Lake in Kochi. The fishermen who had depended on the other three boats are also facing a similar fate. The first among the boats, Poornasree, had sank on May 29. As there is no help in sight, fishermen are trying to salvage the boat by roping in some private firms. With both the fisheries department and the Cochin Port Trust (CPT) expressing their inability to salvage the boats, the fishermen are now forced to seek the help of an expert agency from outside. The shareholders of St Antony boat have already paid around Rs 10 lakh to an agency, which recently attempted to tow the boat but failed. “The Tamil Nadu government has already sent a team to salvage one of the boats. This fishing boat is registered in their state. We are now holding discussions with that agency,” said Sunil. “The debris of the boats are also affecting the movement of vessels passing through the area,” said Parambaragatha Matsya Thozhilali Union president Alosyous T T. A meeting held by the collector on Wednesday had decided to submit a proposal regarding the salvage to the government. The fisheries department officials said that they would submit the proposal, to be prepared in consultation with the CPT, to the government. “We had salvaged the wreckage of a fishing boat earlier after inviting tender. We can give details of the agencies involved in salvaging boats to the fisheries department,” said a CPT source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/boat-capsize-50-fishermen-stare-at-an-uncertain-future/articleshow/86879077.cms||---

The issue of granting land on the MU campus to set up the college took a political turn during the senate meeting. While the MVA government was in favour of granting university land for the purpose, the varsity’s administration was awaiting permission from the governor’s office. High drama ensued on campus as senate members from Yuva Sena sat on the floor to protest the university’s delay in taking a decision, donning black caps and placards, following which the MU administration agreed to send the proposal to the state. Senate member Pradeep Sawant from Yuva Sena said there was no logical reason for delaying the decision. “The proposal was sent by the state in May this year. The university forwarded the letter late to the governor’s office, which in turn sent an inconclusive response on September 24. It will be a university-affiliated college and more students will benefit from it. Leading names from the music industry will be associated with the institute,” said Sawant, adding the reasons for delay were only political. Vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar said in the meeting that the university does not have powers to decide on grant of land, which is why the proposal was sent to the governor. The governor’s office had suggested considering it as part of the ongoing redevelopment plan, he added. The 11 members of Yuva Sena sat in the hall and shouted slogans against the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-drama-in-senate-mu-may-give-nod-to-mangeshkar-college-in-mumbai/articleshow/86879708.cms||---

According to the doctors at Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, the girl was administered primary care after the accident but she developed serious swelling in her body after four hours due to excess air she was breathing through her perforated windpipe. Considering her tender age, the doctors chose to shun surgery and relied on rest and natural healing. “Ideally, such cases need surgical repair wherein we open the chest, go to the lung, and stitch the site of injury or use glue to connect the ruptured pipe. But, in this case, the use of glue carried the risk of re-leak or complete windpipe adhesion,” Dr Sameer Punia, consultant, paediatric intensive care and paediatrics, Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, said. Therefore, doctors located the injury spot through bronchoscopy and kept the area non-functional for three days while the child breathed through a ventilator. After three days when the doctors checked up on the injury site, they found it healed. “She was discharged five days after admission and immediately resumed her normal life,” said Dr Syed Hasan, head of the department of paediatrics and neonatology at Aakash Healthcare. Had the leak in her windpipe not been plugged and repaired, she would only have survived for a couple of hours more as her heart and lungs were at risk of obstructive shock, the doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pencil-punctures-windpipe-docs-treat-2-year-old-without-surgery/articleshow/86879092.cms||---
---||Business||A breaking news that’s 2 decades in the making||NEW DELHI: Recently, while browsing the net on a lazy afternoon, a story popped up which immediately caught my attention. “Singapore Airlines Pulls Out of Air India bid,” screamed the headline of the story written 20 years ago. It was a Saturday. The previous day, another bidder — the billionaire Hinduja brothers — had to withdraw after the law ministry red-flagged their bid, saying they did not meet the strict guidelines set by the government for taking part in the privatisation process. With SIA pulling out, only the Tatas were left in the fray and the determined efforts mounted by the then disinvestment minister Arun Shourie came crashing down. Years rolled by. Political opposition, vested interests and bureaucratic lethargy prevented any effort to sell the loss-making behemoth. The airline continued to pile up debt and services nose-dived. In 2017, the Niti Aayog was asked to prepare a list for privatisation of state-run firms. A senior official of the government’s policy think tank spoke to TOI. Several times during the interaction, the official said why Air India should be sold off. But he never categorically mentioned that any recommendations had been made. After debating for a long time. We decided to go ahead with the story. Some months later in May 20I7, the then finance minister Arun Jaitley, while participating on a Doordarshan show titled ‘Teen Saal Modi Sarkar’, revealed the government planned to privatise Air India. Jaitley said that in 1999-2000, during his brief stint as disinvestment minister, he had said, “Please disinvest Air India, otherwise there will be nothing left to disinvest.” Jaitley then went on to say that the government was open to the idea of inducting a strategic partner for Air India and that the civil aviation ministry was exploring all possibilities. It was ‘breaking news’, as they say. Soon, the process was started to sell 76% in Air India, Air India Express & AISATS. But finally no bidders emerged as investors did not have any appetite for an airline where the government still had some stake left. Finally, a third attempt to sell the airline was launched in 2019. The government made it clear that it wanted to exit the airline 100% and also sweetened the deal to make it attractive for investors. That sums up the more than two decades of twists and turns in the Maharaja’s journey to escape a shutdown. But it piled up a mountain of debt. Now, the government has been able to finally sell the airline. Have a safe flight with your new owners and old mates, Air India||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/a-breaking-news-thats-2-decades-in-the-making/articleshow/86879780.cms||Surojit Gupta
---||Delhi||421 kg crackers seized, 2 held in Sadar Bazar||New Delhi: In the first case of this festive season, two men have been arrested for allegedly transporting firecrackers from Haryana’s Palwal to Delhi to sell them clandestinely in the national capital. They were caught with 421.5kg firecrackers in a tempo in north Delhi’s Sadar Bazar. After Delhi government on September 15 completely banned storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers with immediate effect in the capital, Delhi Pollution Control Committee has extended the ban till January 1, 2022 as a step to tackle winter pollution. According to police, the accused have been identified as Udit (26), who lives in Paharganj, and Nagmani (33), a resident of Bihar. “Around 3.20am on Wednesday, a patrol team in Sadar Bazar saw a tempo coming from Jhandewalan Mandir towards Ram Kumar Marg in Motia Khan. It was stopped and found loaded with illegal firecrackers,” Sagar Singh Kalsi, deputy commissioner of police (northwest), said. “Nagmani, its driver, and Udit, the owner of firecrackers, were inside the vehicle. A case under relevant sections was registered at the Sadar Bazar police station.” The accused told police that Udit, who ran an autorickshaw and stayed in Nabi Karim with his family, wanted to make quick money by selling firecrackers during the festive season. He was allegedly planning to sell them from home. “Three days ago, he approached a man based in Palwal and paid an advance. Nagmani was tasked to deliver the crackers, which was 50% of the order, to Udit in Nabi Karim on Wednesday,” said Kalsi. Both were in touch over mobile phones. “Udit got into the tempo near Jhandewalan,” the DCP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/421-kg-crackers-seized-2-held-in-sadar-bazar/articleshow/86879116.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The labourers had sent a letter to NGO Vizhuthugal four days ago, its director Thangavel said. “They requested us to rescue them and we visited the unit. Nine people from Kaniyur near Madathukulam in Tirupur district, who worked at the unit, were given only Rs 1,000 as weekly wages. They were working at the unit for the last seven months. Two of them managed to escape from there two days ago,” he said. The NGO brought the issue to the knowledge of Pollachi sub-collector who ordered the Anaimalai tahsildar to rescue the workers. A team comprising of revenue department official, a cop from the Kottur police station and members of Vizhuthugal rescued seven bonded labourers and brought them to the Pollachi taluk office. “The bonded labourers were released on Friday night and they were sent to their hometown,” Thangavel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/seven-people-rescued-from-bonded-labour/articleshow/86879352.cms||---

Students are being trained with chapter-wise question banks to ensure that all probable questions are covered. CBSE has split the board exams into two parts --- Term 1 and Term 2. As per the new scheme, Term 1 will be a 90-minute objective type exam, while Term 2 will be a 120-minute subjective test. A candidate marks will be calculated on the basis of the performance in both Terms. The school have given students blueprints, sample questions and weightage for each chapter. “The CBSE had scrapped continuous and comprehensive assessment (CCE) pattern with two terms a few years back. Now we are seeing a different version of CCE as per the recommendations of National Examination Board (NEB). Like the students, schoolteachers are more curious and anticipating the new pattern,” Geetha Laxman of National Model Senior Secondary School, Coimbatore, said. “We are making students create questions on their own in each chapter,” Geetha said, adding that students need to know every chapter in the book thoroughly. “We make them read and understand the chapter properly. Daily test pattern is being followed with continuous study as part of the preparation,” principal of Nava Bharath International School Samson Selladurai said. A four-phased revision for the board exam was planned. Of them, two phases are already over, he said. While half of the questions will be like those asked in NEET and JEE, we are helping students to understand the concepts, he said. Principal of KG International CBSE school S Mathiselvi said that they finished the Term 1 syllabus before September. The offline classes from September were utilized for revision. The schools are conducting revision tests and discussing the answers among children to prepare them for the exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cbse-schools-ready-students-for-mcq-based-term-i-exam/articleshow/86879351.cms||Sampath Kumar

Lakhimpur Kheri, farmers and farmer leaders told TOI, could turn into a “second Delhi border” with “lakhs” from neighbouring states converging on the area. The deadline they have decided on is October 12, the day the Akhand Paath Bhog, a funerary ritual, will be held for the farmers who died.  “If Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni is not sacked and his son Ashish (who has been accused of killing the farmers) not arrested by the 12th, farmers from all neighbouring states will start marching to Lakhimpur Kheri. Lakhs of us, staging blockades, raising our voices,” Harvinder Singh, president of the Uttarakhand unit of the youth wing of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), told TOI. BKU state general secretary, Punjab, Jagmohan Singh told TOI they expect at least 50,000 farmers from other states for the funerary ritual. “Our Sikh and non-Sikh farmers from across the country will gather. They will start two days before the Akhand Paath Bhog and attend the ritual at Kaudiyala Sahib Gurdwara,” he said. “We will stop trains if action is not taken against the minister and his son.” Farmers said the call to congregate has been sent out by Haryana BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni, who was detained in Meerut on his way to Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday and released on Tuesday morning after farmers blocked highways in Haryana. “We have been told to move towards Lakhimpur Kheri instead of the Delhi border at the moment,” a farmer from Khutar in Shahjahanpur said. Protesting farmers said a mahasabha will be held on October 13 if the police “don’t take action” against the accused. “The focus of the farmers’ movement could move to Lakhimpur Kheri,” a farmer leader added. Local intelligence officials said they are on their toes. “We are keeping track of the protests and the farmers most active in the region,” an intelligence official told TOI. “We are working to ensure there are no flare-ups, especially in light of the upcoming assembly election.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/take-action-against-accused-by-oct-12-or-protests-will-grow-farmer-groups/articleshow/86877356.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Coimbatore||New fingerprint matching system to improve crime detection rate||COIMBATORE: The fingerprints bureau will soon be able to use a web-based app from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) to match fingerprints across the country. NCRB has procured National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (Nafis), a scalable, National Institute of Standards and Technology-compliant software, with standard data format. According to fingerprint bureau sources, the Nafis solution is envisaged to consolidate all fingerprint data available with states and Union territories for creation of a national-level searchable fingerprint database. “We received Nafis a few weeks ago from NCRB. As of now, the Coimbatore rural police are using fingerprint analysis tracking system (Facts), which has more than two lakh fingerprints. Once Nafis is deployed, we will be able to match the fingerprints lifted from crime scenes with those across India,” said a senior officer with the fingerprints bureau. “The main responsibility of fingerprint experts is to develop prints left by criminals at crime scenes and to match them with prints of known criminals. We have fingerprints of guest workers, but are not able to match them because the state fingerprint bureau can access only fingerprint details within the state. Once the Nafis system is implemented, we will get millions of fingerprint details from across the country and be able to easily trace criminals and their earlier case details,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/new-fingerprint-matching-system-to-improve-crime-detection-rate/articleshow/86879347.cms||---

The rise in petrol and diesel prices also triggered apprehensions about burgeoning inflation which may lead to hike in prices of other essential items during the ongoing festival season. In the last nine months, the rates of petrol and diesel have gone up by 15-16%. While petrol touched Rs 100.60 per litre, diesel was sold at Rs 92.55 per litre. People complained that their income had declined due to the pandemic and inflation was forcing them to cut down on basic necessities including food, besides leaving them with no savings for the future. Rajiv Singh of Indiranagar said, “I work as a security guard and earn a meagre Rs 20,000 per month. It has become difficult to feed my family, forget about buying new things during festival. If inflation continued to rise, I will have to return to my village.” Prakash Gupta of Alambagh, who owns a garment store, said the government should do something about checking fuel price as it had amplified losses due to the pandemic. “We have stopped our outings and family gatherings as daily commutation has become dearer,” he said. Ajay Singh, a resident of Mahanagar, said petrol prices were higher than that of one gram of silver. Vineeta Srivastava, a teacher who resides in Chowk, said: “Whether it is petrol, edible oil, LPG or vegetables, everything has become costlier with no savings.” Suresh Jain of Rajajipuram, said petrol price hike would lead to rise in the prices of all commodities. “This will rob us of celebrations this festive season,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fuel-prices-on-fire-petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-city/articleshow/86879365.cms||---

Residents of Thiru Vi Ka Nagar had opposed an MCC proposed at the OSR land in the area, but the corporation was not ready to shift the place. Opposing the move, the residents took up the issue with HC. The three-member bench court pronounced the order on Thursday. The court said that location of MCCs in the OSR or park cannot be construed as development in terms of the scheme of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 or the Combined Development Rules, 2019. Therefore, any prohibition contemplated in the Acts do not apply to the implementation of the concept of solid waste management as envisaged in the SWM Rules, 2016.It also said that the government should form committees at the state, district, municipality and panchayat levels to monitor the implementation of the SWM rules, 2016. If there is any negligence of officials towards proper upkeep and maintenance of MCC, stern disciplinary action will be initiated promptly against the officials concerned and if negligence is proved, appropriate punishment will be imposed on them.A corporation official said that construction of 30 micro composting centres has been completed. While work is in progress at four places, work is yet to be taken up at three places. Work did not start at 23 places due to the case and opposition from residents. For the remaining nine MCCs, retender was planned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/construction-of-composting-units-at-osr-sites-okayed/articleshow/86879350.cms||---

After three ward members in J Krishnapuram village panchayat (ward number 6), Jallipatti village panchayat (ward number 8) and Zaminmuthur village panchayat (ward number 6) were elected unopposed, the byelection will be conducted to 13 posts. State election commission officials have identified five polling booths as vulnerable and 29 as critical. “We will videograph the polling process in 19 polling stations. Fifteen micro observers have been appointed. As many as 740 staff will be deployed for byelection work,” said an official. More than 70,000 voters will exercise their franchise using ballot papers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bypoll-to-13-local-body-posts-today/articleshow/86879349.cms||---

Two days after burglars made away with gold ornaments weighing 101 sovereigns from a house at Velavan Nagar Extension near Maniyakarampalayam, unidentified people had broken into a house at Peelamedu in the early hours of Wednesday and decamped with Rs 91,000 and gold ornaments weighing 63.5 sovereigns. This was the fourth house break-in to be reported in the city in the past 15 days. A week ago, burglars had struck at the house of a police constable at the police quarters and stolen gold ornaments. Police are, however, yet to make a breakthrough in any of the cases. The latest house to be burgled was that of 44-year-old R Suresh, a resident of Margazhi Street at Sivaram Nagar on Vilankurichi Road. An engineer with a private firm in Singapore, he had returned to the city to live with his family because of the pandemic situation. A police officer said Suresh and family had gone to Thiruvannamalai temple on Saturday (October 2) morning. “They returned home on Wednesday night and found the front door lock was broken open and the gold ornaments and cash were missing from the house.” Suresh alerted the Peelamedu police, who rushed to the spot and held inquiry with him and his neighbour. “We collected footages from the CCTV cameras in the locality and found two suspects roaming there in the early hours of Wednesday.” The Peelamedu police have registered a case under Sections 380 (theft in dwelling house etc) and 457 (lurking house-trespass or house breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code. In the early hours of Monday, two unidentified people had broken into the house of 44-year-old businessman K Dhinakaran at Velavan Nagar extension near Maniyakarampalayam and stolen 101 sovereigns of gold. While the Saravanampatti police had registered a case and the city police commissioner had formed four special teams to nab the burglars, they haven’t made any progress in the case. Now, the special teams have the additional responsibility of solving the house break-in on Margazhi Street. Another police officer said they hadn’t received any lead in the series of house break-ins in the city. “Most of the burglaries are reported from Peelamedu and Saravanampatti police limits. So, city police commissioner Deepak M Damor has instructed assistant police commissioners to provide additional manpower to the two stations for night patrol.” The officer said the beat police officers were instructed to collect details of locked houses in their areas daily and hand the same over to police inspectors. “Cops on night patrol should cover such houses. If they fail to collect the details of locked houses, stringent action would be taken against them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cops-fail-to-crack-down-on-burglars-on-break-in-spree/articleshow/86879348.cms||A Subburaj

Speaking at the 67th Wildlife Week Celebration organised at the Tamil Nadu Forest Academy, the minister said native tree species will be planted in forests. “Wildlife can thrive only if there is substantial forest cover. When wildlife population increases, forests should offer the required food, for which native tree species are necessary. We are focusing on planting more native tree species by removing exotic species like eucalyptus brought by the Britishers,” he said. Schoolteachers should encourage students to plant saplings on their birthday and nurture them, Ramachandran suggested. “This will help improve green cover.” In the last five years, 337 people were killed by wild animals and the state government gave compensation to their families, said the minister. Asked about the delay in capturing the prowling tiger in the Nilgiris, Ramachandran said capturing it is a challenging task and advanced technology is being used by the forest department for the purpose. “People from various departments are involved in capturing T-23. Ten members of the team that conducted search for forest brigand Veerappan are part of the team in search of T-23.” The minister also unveiled the logo of Coimbatore Forest Division. It has an elephant in the backdrop, symbolising the large number of elephants found in the Western Ghats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-will-increase-forest-cover-to-33-minister/articleshow/86879353.cms||---

However, he also added the food business operators (FBOs) should not be harassed. In his first meeting with the officers at Punjab Bhawan on Friday, Soni said, “Gone are the days of arm twisting in the name of sampling. Ensure sampling to provide quality food to public but at the same time no undue harassment of food business operators will be tolerated.” Soni said the district health officers should not conduct sampling for the sake of sampling or for meeting monthly targets. They should conduct effective sampling to weed out those indulging in malpractices in food trade and prevent sale of substandard food items to the public, he added. “Ensuring the highest quality of food products for the people of the state is be your primary responsibility and any deviation from the course of action will not be tolerated,” said Soni. The deputy chief minister also directed the drug control officers to check illegal sale of habit-forming drugs in the state. Refusing to permit the opening of more private drug de-addiction centres in the state, he said evaluation of the performance of all existing de-addiction centres must be conducted and thereafter, if need be, permission for more centres will be granted. Condemning turning a blind eye to the working of the existing de-addiction centres, he said monthly inspection will be done and occasional surprise checks are made to ensure proper record of drugs purchased and supplied by these centres. “Most stringent action be taken if any mismatch in drug inventory is seen,” said Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ensure-quality-food-without-harassing-fbos-soni/articleshow/86879375.cms||---

However, the final date would be decided later. PMRDA officials said the land acquisition process was nearly complete for the corridor and that the Pune Municipal Corporation has already given an in-principle approval to the University flyover plan, clearing the decks for the concessionaire — Tata-Siemens — to start the project. The project has to be completed within three years and four months from the commencement date. The PMRDA sources told TOI that with the entire process ready, only the commencement date was awaited to start the work. “Once the date is decided, the concessionaire will share the plan phase-wise, and execute it,” the officials said. Currently, some preliminary work is already underway, such as barricading of around 3km and foundation work of the pillars within it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hinjewadi-to-shivajinagar-line-may-get-dasara-start/articleshow/86879570.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Women fulfil daily needs of water, leading to multiple trips to a water point which causes mental and physical stress. Efforts are being made by the government and non-government actors to formally recognise the vital role played by women in water provision and its management, but it still goes unrecognised. Access to clean water closer to home can unlock a woman’s potential – economically, educationally and socially. Women’s voices and leadership are critical to realising safe, private, accessible and functional water sources for everyone. The government of India has set the ambitious goal of ensuring safe and adequate drinking water through functional taps in every rural household by 2024. In the meantime, the commitment is to ensure the availability of safe water at a horizontal or vertical distance of not more than 100 metres from a household. As per the 76th round report (December 2018) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), 9.3% households across India have primary source of drinking water beyond 200 metres, and 9.6% households have principal source of drinking water beyond 30 minutes for a round trip. According to a rough estimate, 12 crore women everyday spend over 2-3 hours in water collection, walk more than 2 kilometres and carry nearly 200 litres of water. The burden of water collection on women and the time consumed every day adds to uncounted and unpaid hard labour. It is estimated that women spend 150 million workdays every year fetching water which amounts to the national loss of income of Rs 10 billion. This time should be utilised by women for education, work, family or for themselves. Experiences indicate that women and their collectives, when given training and opportunities, have contributed not merely to the operational aspects of water supply systems, but have also efficiently taken up technical and management roles. The participation of women in local water governance is recognised as necessary for achieving sustainable management of water resources. Institutions are being created to enable effective participation and leadership of women in the use and management of resources. The recent compendium of stories of women water champions, from various WaterAid offices across the country and other experiences compiled by UNDP, present the wide spectrum of women’s role in local water governance. In Madhya Pradesh, thousands of women have led the process of making village action plans for household tap connections, ensuring that no one is left behind and people decide and lead on the design, delivery and sustainability of the Jal Jeevan Mission. These women lead drinking water quality monitoring, share findings and ensure remedial action wherever necessary. The trained women in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha create awareness on water quality, mobilise community members for restoring abandoned dug wells, recycle waste water to productive use in the garden, construct rainwater harvesting systems and maintain water purification systems. In the remote forest villages of Debagarh, women’s collectives have taken up repair and maintenance of handpumps and other water supply systems making a livelihood from these services. In water scarce villages, women have catalysed a community’s collective action to improve water use practices securing drinking water. In Jharkhand, women have dug ponds and, while sustaining drinking water in the area, started a pond-based livelihood programme. The campaign is led by women on the ground to promote water literacy, stewardship and bring about change in water conservation and governance. Experiences indicate how gender disparity and power differences can be addressed by women leadership and result in beneficial effects of water governance in communities.

---||Pune||Pune: Metro work in Khadki area to gain momentum after land transfer nod||PUNE: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said it hoped to pick up the pace on raising 17 of 35 Metro piers along the old Pune-Mumbai stretch, from Khadki railway gate to All Saints High School. MahaMetro said the decks have been cleared after the state cabinet’s decision on Wednesday giving the Ministry of Defence equal-value land in Yerawada in lieu of a 10.74-acre plot in Khadki cantonment. This stretch falls on the PCMC-Swargate Metro corridor. MahaMetro had started work on 18 pillars on this stretch but was unable to build the rest over land transfer issues, said MahaMetro officials. Route tracker“The state cabinet decision will pave the way for the pending work now, as we expect to get the required land in Khadki cantonment. The Pune Municipal Corporation will also be undertaking a road-widening project along the stretch,” Hemant Sonawane, MahaMetro’s general manager (public relations), told TOI on Friday. PMC plans to widen the road here to 42 meters to address traffic problems and to construct a Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) lane from Harris Bridge to the Patil estate area. “The additional land is crucial for adequate carriageway. With the construction of the metro pillars, the existing 21m wide road is not enough. So, we decided to widen it. Commuters will get adequate carriageway and Metro will also get required space for pillars,” V G Kulkarni, head of the PMC’s road department, said. Officials from the defence estates office, Pune circle, said they have already applied to the defence ministry for permission for both works. Vineet Nair, defence estates officer, told TOI on Friday, “We discussed this issue in detail in the last meeting chaired by divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, who had agreed to give equal-value land to the ministry. Based on that, we had forwarded the proposal to MoD to get the work permit for these projects.” A DEO official said the conditions put forth by the station headquarter, Khadki, and the Local Military Authority were also discussed in the meeting. “One of the conditions is to construct a flyover at All Saint’s Chowk and widen two underpasses in the Khadki-Range Hills area. Also, the reconstruction of the assets that will be demolished in the road-widening work in the area was sought. The ministry will issue the work permit subject to fulfilment of all these conditions,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-work-in-khadki-area-to-gain-momentum-after-land-transfer-nod/articleshow/86879279.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Ludhiana||No PPA repudiation notice for GVK even after month||PATIALA: Even a month after deciding to repudiate the power purchase agreement with GVK and tell the state’s other two independent power producers (IPPs) that they were in default, Punjab Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is sitting on these notices. The state government approved the PPA’s repudiation on the recommendation of a three-member PSPCL committee that had observed the unit rate to be Rs 10 compared with Rs 3 to 3.50 in the national exchange. To the Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) and Nabha Power Limited (NPL), the state government will serve notice for only default and not termination of the PPAs. Confronted, PSPCL chairman and managing director A Venu Parsad said: "So far, the notices of repudiation or default are not served to any of three IPPs in Punjab but we will do that soon." The three-member committee that suggested repudiation had also observed that GVK had the lowest merit of three IPPs due to its higher variable rate and lesser quantum of scheduled power, while the corporation had to be pay full capacity charges for the plant’s declared availability. The committee also anticipated that the state will strengthen its transmission system and so its ATC (available transfer capability) will rise by 500 to 1,000 megawatts next year, and by another 1,000 MW in the later few years. It hoped that and this will help PSPCL procure much cheaper electricity for the paddy sowing seasons from the short-term market to compensate for the loss of generation from GVK. A bulk of the paddy-season electricity goes to agricultural tube-wells, since this crop guzzles water. The PSPCL committee stated in its last report to the state government that: "From financial year 2018-19 to 2020-21, the state surrendered 5,737 million units (MUs) of energy, while paying the fixed charges of Rs 1,017 crore. The cost of surrendered power from this plant was Rs 142 crore, 610 crore, and 265 crore in the years 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21, respectively, while the average unit price (fixed + variable) of GVK remained at Rs 6.63, Rs 10.02, and Rs 7.53, respectively. For avoiding a loss protecting the consumers’ interest, repudiation of the PPA is a must. It is not in the state’s interest to continue with GVK." Some experts in the energy sector claim that shutting down NPL and TSPL will have least impact, since Punjab’s ATC/TTC (total transfer capability) limit will increase, allowing it to import more electricity, as cited in Northern Regional Load Dispatch Centre’s joint study of the TTC/ATC limit of Punjab to import power from the northern grid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-ppa-repudiation-notice-for-gvk-even-after-month/articleshow/86879376.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Join live aarti at Bandra Durga Puja||MUMBAI: Stepping out for some fun or staying at home in fear might be the lingering question even on Sasthi morning or the sixth day of Navratra as the lure of Durga Puja after months of restraint beckons. However, given the Covid count that threatens to spike during festive season, the Bandra Durga Puja, in association with The Times of India, will offer devotees virtual options to watch the puja from the safety of their home amid the pandemic. Also known as the Notunpalli Sarbojonin Durgotsab, Bandra’s 49-year-old Durga puja — instituted by veterans of Indian cinema like Pramod Chakravorty, Shakti Samanta and Basu Chatterji and patronised by the likes of former Maharashtra chief ministers Vasant Dada Patil and S B Chavan to Bollywood stalwarts Sunil Dutt, Hemant Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan — has been an elaborate affair for decades that has witnessed a footfall of over four lakh enthusiasts over five days of puja. As Covid-19 changed the form of this big-ticket puja — commonly organised at Patwardhan Park that shifted to a smaller venue at the Bandra Hindu Association with a 4ft Durga idol to ensure safety — the celebrations took a virtual leap in 2020. Like last year, the morning pushpanjali, evening aarti, and other puja rituals will, once again, be broadcast live from the pandal over Notunpalli and TOI’s social media pages that one can tune into. All one needs to do is register one-time at www.bandradurgapuja-.com. After the free registration, the user will receive an SMS before every aarti with a link to where the livestreaming can be accessed every day from October 11 to 14. “Like last year, it’s going to be a small affair keeping all the Covid protocols in mind, but despite the restrictions we’re trying to make the most of the circumstances by having cultural performances every evening,” said Naba Kumar Daas, member of the Notunpalli puja committee. “While our members and their families will sing, dance and recite poetry, we will also have professional singers performing various genres of music, all of which will be livestreamed on our social media platforms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-join-live-aarti-at-bandra-durga-puja/articleshow/86879447.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Randhawa attacks Centre on inflation, economic policies||Chandigarh: The Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Friday attacked the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre for skyrocketing inflation owing to “disastrous economic policies”. He said the LPG gas rates have increased by Rs 300 during the last 10 months, which has broken the back of the common man. This enormous increase comes at a time when the farmers are passing through a financial crisis due to black farm laws and every section of the society is reeling under economic distress because of the Covid-19 battered economy, he said. “This increase is all the more alarming considering the fast approaching festival season as every spectrum of our society is closely connected to it,” he said. Randhawa added that last November, the price of LPG gas was Rs 600 which has touched a new high of Rs 900 due to the anti-people fiscal policy framework of the Union government. The NDA government has double the LPG gas prices during the previous seven years which in May 2014 stood at Rs 400, he said. Not only the LPG gas cylinder but even the prices of petrol and diesel have touched a record high in the last seven years, he said. Taking a dig at the Union ministers, the deputy chief minister questioned BJP’s silence over ever increasing inflation when it had created a furore over a nominal increase in oil and gas cylinder prices during the UPA rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/randhawa-attacks-centre-on-inflation-economic-policies/articleshow/86879377.cms||---

The decision was taken on Friday at the university’s senate meeting. Senate members Vaibhav Thorat and Shashikant Zone moved an adjournment motion against the purchase of high-end cars by the vice-chancellor and pro-vice-chancellor. The university rejected it, though, stating the decision to buy the cars was taken in the management council and there was no point of discussion. The members insisted, though, and asked the state to intervene. “Senate members had insisted that the state government should step in and look into this matter. We will form a committee and submit our report by the next senate. Then, the state government and the senate will decide what must be done,” said Sonali Rode, joint director, higher education. Earlier last month, the state government had passed a government resolution (GR) and capped the price for purchasing automobiles for university authorities. The cars, though, were bought three years ago. “The cars were purchased before the GR came into force. Hence, the panel will look into it carefully and also examine which funds were used to buy these cars,” added Rode. On December 13, 2019, TOI had reported that the MU vice-chancellor and pro-vice-chancellor purchased two topline vehicles for Rs 64 lakh using the university’s general fund. The higher education minister had noticed most VCs in the state had bought high-end vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-soon-state-inquiry-panel-against-mu-officials-for-buying-top-end-cars-in-18/articleshow/86879710.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The airport was overwhelmed by the weekend rush of passengers who jostled and struggled to reach their boarding gates on time. Social distancing was forgotten as passengers packed in thick at the security gates. Airport officials attributed the crowding to weekend rush, onset of festive season and heightened security following intelligence alerts of "threat at another airport in the state.’’ In preparation for next weekend, MIAL brought forward the reopening of terminal-1 in Vile Parle to October 13. The airport will also ask airlines to allow passengers to check in their cabin luggage to avoid delays at security handling. Said an airline source: “Weekend passengers flying out of Mumbai should reach the terminal building a minimum of two hours before departure. Even then, if they have check-in bags to deposit, they will struggle to reach the boarding gate on time.” On Friday, with many unable to reach boarding gates on time, most morning flights departed late. The few that departed on time were those scheduled before 6am such as to Goa, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Kochi, Udaipur and Kolkata. Of the 115 domestic flights scheduled from 6am to 12noon, 105 were delayed beyond 15 minutes, with most of them late by 20-30 minutes in taking off and some beyond an hour, showed data from Flightradar24, a live flight tracking app. Flight delays continued for the rest of the day, though only by an average 20-25 minutes. Arjun Vas, a passenger, tweeted: “I missed my flight this morning...Security and other airport officials doing nothing at all to regulate the people. People were breaking queue, throwing their luggage on the belt.

Deviating from the original plan, which was to launch the party’s 2022 election campaign, the rally will now be dedicated to farmers dignity or Kisan Samman. It will be called Kisan Nyay Rally. Posters and banners of the rally were circulated to the party workers late on Friday night. Sources said the change of plan was made effective after Priyanka held a closed door meeting at her Lucknow residence. Hectic activity was underway at the party headquarters in Lucknow and at Kaul House (the official residence of Priyanka in Lucknow) on Friday. All India Congress committee secretary and advisor to the CM of Chhattisgarh, Rajesh Tewari, is overseeing activities on ground while UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and Sewa Dal chief Pramod Pandey are coordinating the work. Sources also said the Congress leader has issued instructions to fix responsibility for each task assigned. In addition, she has told the members in the organising committee to ensure the participation of those who have been covered in the special 26 training sessions. They added that Priyanka, in all likelihood, will unfold the Saath Vachan agenda during her interface with the people. The promises will broadly relate to farmers, unemployed youth, home makers (inflation), women safety, opportunities to students, public health and working class. Earlier, Priyanka Gandhi had held discussions with UP Congress functionaries on the route and programme of the yatra that will cover 12,000km across UP. Covering more than 300 seats of the UP Vidhan Sabha, the yatra aims to take Congress message against BJP to the public. The yatra is to be launched from Varanasi on October 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/priyanka-to-blow-bugle-for-farmers-dignity-at-varanasi-rally/articleshow/86884693.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||Police chief Asthana creates a perception management division amid major reshuffle||New Delhi: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has created a “perception management” division to ensure rightful propagation of its efforts towards public safety amongst other things. The division will be headed by special commissioner and former Chandigarh DGP Sanjay Baniwal. Earlier, Asthana’s predecessor SN Shrivastava had announced creation of “cyber perception management unit (cyber-PMU)” that was aimed at clearing the “cyber fog” by bringing out “credible and official version” of reported events and assisting in its mass propagation using cyber volunteers. Baniwal could later be made the chief of technology and project implementation division as well, said sources. Apart from announcing the new division, an order by the home department on Saturday led to reshuffle of over 30 senior officers in the rank ranging from additional DCP to special CPs. Joint commissioners of central and northern range have been removed and posted to legal division and operations, respectively. DCP Harendra Singh will handle additional charge of legal division as well. Additional CP AK Singh has been brought to traffic from licencing and Maneesh Aggarwal as joint CP. Meenu Chaudhary has been made joint commissioner of Southern range.

---||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to blow bugle for farmers’ dignity at Varanasi rally||LUCKNOW: Buoyed by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s assertive avatar and display of leadership, UP Congress is now sparing no effort to make her rally in Varanasi on Sunday a landmark event. Deviating from the original plan, which was to launch the party’s 2022 election campaign, the rally will now be dedicated to farmers dignity or Kisan Samman. It will be called Kisan Nyay Rally. Posters and banners of the rally were circulated to the party workers late on Friday night. Sources said the change of plan was made effective after Priyanka held a closed door meeting at her Lucknow residence. Hectic activity was underway at the party headquarters in Lucknow and at Kaul House (the official residence of Priyanka in Lucknow) on Friday. All India Congress committee secretary and advisor to the CM of Chhattisgarh, Rajesh Tewari, is overseeing activities on ground while UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and Sewa Dal chief Pramod Pandey are coordinating the work. Sources also said the Congress leader has issued instructions to fix responsibility for each task assigned. In addition, she has told the members in the organising committee to ensure the participation of those who have been covered in the special 26 training sessions. They added that Priyanka, in all likelihood, will unfold the Saath Vachan agenda during her interface with the people. The promises will broadly relate to farmers, unemployed youth, home makers (inflation), women safety, opportunities to students, public health and working class. Earlier, Priyanka Gandhi had held discussions with UP Congress functionaries on the route and programme of the yatra that will cover 12,000km across UP. Covering more than 300 seats of the UP Vidhan Sabha, the yatra aims to take Congress message against BJP to the public. The yatra is to be launched from Varanasi on October 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-to-blow-bugle-for-farmers-dignity-at-varanasi-rally/articleshow/86879381.cms||Shailvee Sharda

While Teni’s counsel said “no case” against him is pending, the verdict in the murder case has not been pronounced by the Allahabad high court since 2018. On July 8, 2000, Teni was booked for murder at Tikunia police station. Local police said a “history sheet” had been maintained against him but it was quashed later. In 2004, the district and sessions court in Kheri acquitted Teni in the murder of local businessman Prabhat Gupta. His family then moved the high court. In 2018, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court reserved its judgment. When it didn’t pronounce the verdict after nine months, the case was transferred to another bench. The second bench has still not given its verdict. Teni was accused of killing Gupta, in a busy market. “He never went to jail,” Teni’s lawyer Avdhesh Kumar Singh told TOI. He is the one who had secured his bail then. “Many people had signed affidavits saying Teni was not present at the spot of Gupta’s death.” As the case went on, the rivalry grew more intense — Gupta's brother Rajeev, his brother Sanjeev and their father were accused of trying to kill Teni on court premises during trial in 2003. Sanjeev was convicted and the two others acquitted. “There is no case pending against my client. He has either been acquitted by court or the cases have been withdrawn by the state government,” Singh said. In his 2019 affidavit for the election to the Kheri Lok Sabha seat, Teni did mention the murder charge and the “pending” appeal against acquittal. “I was 24 then. I am 45 now. We are waiting for the verdict. It has been years. We had given up. But with the focus on the Kheri case, we hope ours will be in the spotlight soon," said Rajeev.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-in-spotlight-local-family-talks-of-pending-plea-against-teni-in-hc/articleshow/86879538.cms||---

To recall, Manish Gupta had died under mysterious circumstances during a police raid at a hotel in Gorakhpur, where he was staying with his two friends hailing from Gurugram. Police, however, claimed that they had raided the hotel after inputs of suspicious activities there. Police said while they were questioning the trio, Manish Gupta fell on the ground as he was drunk and suffered a head injury. He was taken to the BRD Medical College where he died during treatment, police claimed. Manish’s family members had accused policemen of assaulting Manish severely, causing his death. Subsequently, the state government had on Friday last recommended a CBI probe into the death of Gupta. A recommendation to this effect has been made to the Central government on the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish K Awasthi had stated in a press statement. Till the time the CBI takes over the inquiry, the special investigation team (SIT) set up for the purpose will probe the matter, transferring the case to Kanpur from Gorakhpur,” the statement had stated further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sit-announces-reward-on-information-on-six-absconding-cops/articleshow/86879300.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Senior administrative officials, including divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar visited the back-up control centre of power supply SCADA project at IIT-Kanpur where a new command and control room is being established. Explaining about its features, the divisional commissioner said, “Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture consisting of computer, network data communication and graphical user interface (GIS) for high level process supervisory management. It is a special project launched by Smart City which will help Kanpur city to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity to its citizens.” The project will help in substantial reduction in power consumption, making it an effective and efficient operation, besides providing better maintenance to the power supply system. The project also helps in data collection, analysis and system improvement, officials added. “The total budget of the project is about Rs 64 crore. Around Rs 44 crore is funded by Smart City, and Rs 20 crore is funded by Kanpur Electricity Supply Company (KESCO). The project implementation agency is KESCO,” said the commissioner. The developer is the GE company which will implement the project in 18 months and will also maintain the system for 5 years after the completion of the project. IIT-Kanpur is the main advisor for the power SCADA project implementation. "The agency has been asked to complete the work by October 2022,” he added. About 20% of the physical progress has been completed so far. The commissioner has also directed the nodal officers of Smart City, KESCO, IIT-Kanpur team and officials of the construction agency to sit together on a weekly basis and expedite the progress. Anil Dhingra, managing director, KESCO, Shivsharanappa, Kanpur Municipal Corporation commissioner, Manish Gupta, executive engineer, KESCO, Vipin Kumar, assistant engineer, Ankush Sharma, professor, IIT-Kanpur, Shaukat Chakraborty, professor, IIT Kanpur, Shivkumar, IIT -Kanpur and Riju Mittal, project director GE, were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-smart-city-ropes-in-iit-k-profs-to-ensure-better-power-supply/articleshow/86879301.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Housing societies make dash to set up EV charging infra||HYDERABAD: With the demand for electric vehicles (EV) slated to pick up over the next few years, gated communities and residential apartments in the western corridor of the city are all charged up about providing the necessary EV charging infrastructure to residents who own EVs. In a bid to boost EV sales and bring down the city’s carbon footprint, the Telangana government had rolled out the Telangana Electric Vehicle and Energy Storage Policy, 2020-2030, in October last year.  Telangana already has about 20 electric vehicle manufacturers including two wheelers, three wheelers, retrofits and bus makers. A year after the official launch of the policy, many gated communities and residential apartments have already begun putting in place the requisite EV infrastructure or are in the process of devising a plan to do so. Especially with the prices of petrol and diesel zooming past the Rs 100 mark, sending many residents scurrying to make the switch to EVs that will be lighter on the pocket in the long run. “Considering the petrol prices have already crossed Rs 100 mark and are rising by the day, investing in an electric vehicle only made sense to me as my job requires me to travel to the IT corridor on a daily basis,” said Vidya Krishnan who works for an engine equipment manufacturing company. Gated communities such as My Home Bhooja and My Home Avatar have taken the lead to set up EV charging stations within their community. “Four months back, we installed two EV stations within the premises. These enable charging of four cars at a time. We offer charging at a cost of Rs 6.50 per unit and there is a separate prepaid meter for these stations. Depending on the demand for these charging stations, we would expand it in future,” said M Sachindra, vice-president of My Home Bhooja at Madhapur. While the government is set to call bids for 140 EV charging stations across the state including Hyderabad, several residential apartments are setting up an in-house charging equipment. “Since people have started buying EVs, we wanted something that is easy and immediate without any overheads. To set up a common charging station within the community, we would have needed a huge infrastructure, space and funds. As an interim move, we are providing power outlets at the respective parking lots where those with EVs can fix an electric meter and charge their vehicles,” said Rajagopal Marripalli, general secretary at Nagarjuna Residency, Telecom Nagar, Gachibowli. To encourage more people to take up EVs, the Telangana government is making efforts to establish EV charging stations at IT parks for at least 20% of the parking capacity. A three-day EV Trade Expo scheduled to be held in the city later this month is expected to provide a platform to members from residential welfare communities to connect with the EV ecosystem stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/housing-societies-make-dash-to-set-up-ev-charging-infra/articleshow/86879215.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Allahabad||CSA Park issue: Govt files compliance report in Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Pursuant to the order passed by the court, the state authorities on Friday produced a compliance report before Allahabad high court, stating therein the removal of the structures and encroachments, which were carried out after 1975 in Chandrashekar Azad Park at Prayagraj. However, the petitioner Jitendra Singh Vishen, who appeared in person before the court, submitted that all the structures/encroachments have not yet been removed. The submission of the petitioner was seriously contested by the official respondents. In view of the above, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Piyush Agrawal directed the official respondents to file an affidavit to the effect that compliance to the judgment of the apex court in the case of Allahabad Ladies Club Versus Jitendra Nath Singh and others, (2007) 11 SCC 609 has been made and all the improvements/constructions/encroachments have been removed from the park. The court further directed that the aforesaid affidavit would be filed within a week with a copy to the counsel for the petitioners. The court fixed October 21 as the next date of hearing of this matter. The court also directed that the copy of the compliance report would be supplied to the counsel for the petitioners during the course of the day. Earlier, on October 5, 2021, this court had directed the Uttar Pradesh government to remove, within three days, all the encroachments including graves, mazars or mosque constructed or created within the area of the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Prayagraj, which was earlier known as Alfred Park. Besides, the court, while referring to an apex court ruling in the case of Allahabad Ladies Club Versus Jitendra Nath Singh and others (2007) 11 SCC 609, had directed the authorities that all illegal encroachments in the park that came up after 1975 should be demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/csa-park-issue-govt-filescompliance-report-in-hc/articleshow/86879298.cms||---

Earlier, the JMC-Heritage officials used to catch the stray cattle themselves. The thriving illegal dairies in the Walled City have increased stray cattle menace. In fact, there are at least 120 identified illegal cattle dairies in the JMC-Heritage area. Stray cattle left by the dairy owners create traffic jams and cause accidents. The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) had earlier allotted land to shifting them out of the city, but the illegal dairies haven’t moved yet. The civic body claims to have cut the electricity and water connections of 50-60 dairies. Also, vacation affidavits were taken from 40 dairy, but no movement took place. Many campaigns were launched to curb the menace of stray cattle in the Walled City, but to no avail. A JMC-Heritage, requesting anonymity, said, "We have capped the rate at Rs 380 per animal. Contractors will be paid per animal and they will be fined for not fulfilling their daily targets." "We have received various complaints of stray animals not being caught by the corporation on time. Anyway, we do not have enough resources. Hence, we will float tenders to hire contractors," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritage-to-float-tenders-to-speed-up-stray-cattle-lifting/articleshow/86879057.cms||---

Nampally police said that 40-year-old Ramesh Reddy hung himself from a shower rod during the day after he requested cops on guard to allow him to use the bathroom. On Thursday morning, an assistant sub-inspector and two constables from Rajasthan arrived in Hyderabad and arrested Ramesh for allegedly transferred Rs 7 lakh, with help from the local Meerpet police station. Around 7.30 pm, they brought him to the lodge in Nampally, but did not produce him before a concerned local court to obtain a prison transit warrant. Officials said three policemen were guarding Ramesh Reddy throughout the night by turn. “At 5.30 am on Friday, the ASI got up from sleep and used the washroom. Later, Ramesh too wanted to use the washroom. He locked the washroom from inside and as he was not coming out, the cops forced open the door and found the accused hanging,” Joint commissioner of police (central zone) Viswa Prasad said. Later Nampally police reached the spot and removed the body from the shower. “A case was registered under the charge of custodial death and a judicial magistrate was also alerted as per National Human Right Commission guidelines,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-man-kills-self-in-raj-cop-custody/articleshow/86879651.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bail pleas of Aryan Khan, 2 others rejected on grounds of ‘jurisdiction of court’||MUMBAI: A magistrate court on Friday rejected Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan’s plea for bail on grounds of maintainability and jurisdiction of court. It rejected bail pleas of his friend Arbaaz Merchant, 26, and Munmun Dhamecha, 28, as well. The court only pronounced the operative part of the order, and reasons will follow later as it was the end of the court day and dictation would take long. Khan’s counsel Satish Maneshinde said in court that it was fine if the operative part was delivered because if necessary, they would ready themselves to approach sessions court. Later, he declined to comment. But with a weekend ahead, it will be two nights in jail before a fresh bail plea gets taken up for hearing in sessions court. All three were arrested on October 3 following a raid by the Narcotics Control Bureau on a cruise ship which led to seizure of drugs. Maneshinde said with “not even an ounce” of contraband found on him, he ought not to be denied bail and with alleged chats on his phone leading up to no recovery, he cannot be kept in custody for a minute.  The applications are “not maintainable” before his court, said additional chief metropolitan magistrate R M Nerlikar, after hearing and accepting preliminary objections raised by NCB special counsel, ASG Anil Singh, and agency’s prosecutor Advait Sethna. Singh cited judgments, including the one by Bombay HC granting bail to actor Rhea Chakraborty, where it was held all NDPS offences are non-bailable and hence the case is exclusively triable by the special court, which is at the sessions court, rendering the magistrate sans jurisdiction to consider bail. The sessions court has jurisdiction to hear and grant regular bail and by that virtue also consider a plea for interim bail, while the magistrate can only grant remand, said Singh, stressing he was not trampling on anyone’s right to seek bail. “Am not saying they cannot seek it elsewhere. It is not maintainable here ( Esplanade court),” he said, adding that on October 7 the court had already forwarded the case to the special sessions court. The court first heard Maneshinde and advocates Taraq Sayed for Merchant and Ali Kaashif Khan for Dhamecha. They said not only is the magistrate empowered to grant bail, on merits too they are entitled as NCB has shown no material. Sayed said the NCB case, if accepted, merely says 6 gm charas was found on him, which attracts at best a maximum of 6 months’ in jail. Singh said the NCB case against 17 persons so far is one of criminal conspiracy where witness and evidence will be common. There cannot be two trials and granting bail to some would hamper probe as influential accused can tamper with evidence and witnesses. Lawyers for the trio denied being part of any criminal conspiracy. Maneshinde said merely because section 27 A (trafficking) under NDPS Act is invoked, it cannot be foisted on Khan. Maneshinde said Khan “belongs to a respectable family with roots in society.” “Merely because he is from an influential family, it cannot be a ground to suggest he may tamper with a probe or to deny him bail.” He cited a judgment which essentially says the effect of an unhealthy practice of denying or opposing bail is that a maliciously prosecuted person remains in jail. “ They (NCB) say they have chats, but for bail they can be disregarded,” said Maneshinde. The ASG said, “chats are relevant... the chat refers to “bulk” quantities.” He said suppliers were arrested and now a Nigerian too with commercial quantities. The court remanded the foreign national Chinedu Igwe to NCB custody till October 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-pleas-of-aryan-2-others-rejected-on-grounds-of-jurisdiction-of-court/articleshow/86879415.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: City gears up to improve position in swachh survey||JAIPUR: Swachhta Survekshan 2.0 has been launched by the government of India and Jaipur has to gear up to improve the degrading sanitation condition. This year, the total marks will be 3000 in sustainable sanitation and Safai Mitra’s security, segregated waste and processing, and disposal of waste will be looked into as well for ranking. A municipal body has to give proof about the percentage of city connected to modern sewerage and that no manual scavenging is done to clean the sceptic tanks. This year, for processing of waste, there are 27% marks and disposal will have 8% marks. The division is made to see whether the city has adequate facilities to process the wet waste collection. Due to the pandemic, preparedness for epidemic and disaster management is also a part of Swachhta Survekshan this year. Jaipur does have small units to dispose of the waste, but the segregated waste has to be collected which is yet to start. Waste segregation holds 900 marks this year. Without any segregated waste collection and no proper processing of the waste, landfill sites at Langaniyawas and Sewapura have mountains of garbage accumulated. Residents living around the landfill sites have complained many times but the government hasn’t done enough to start processing it. Around 1,300 tonnes of waste generated in the city is dumped at Langaniyawas and Sewapura without segregation, although waste segregation has been a part of the door-to-door waste collection programme. Ashish Kumar Srivastav, deputy commissioner health at JMC-Heritage said, “We have started planning our next step as per the new guidelines. Our motive is to improve the sanitation condition to be able to perform better this year as per the new guidelines.” This however, still seems to be a distant dream as waste collection is not being done properly. The tussle between the company responsible for waste collection and municipal corporations has impacted the sanitation condition. In outer parts of city, garbage vehicles are collecting trash once or twice in a week. The company doesn’t have adequate resources for waste collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-gears-up-to-improve-position-in-swachh-survey/articleshow/86879043.cms||---

The airport will be formally inaugurated on Saturday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and Union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises Narayan Rane will be present at the function. All of them are expected to leave for Sindhudurg together on a plane from Mumbai. Both, Sena and Rane, have put up hoardings along the route to the airport, claiming credit for the airport. On Friday, Rane at a press conference in Mumbai affirmed it was through his efforts that Chipi airport took shape and was completed. It was he who, in the ’90s, took efforts to develop Sindhudurg as a tourist destination, adding that Shiv Sena was nowhere in the picture, but was now seeking to take credit. “It was I who approached Scindia and requested him to begin operations from Chipi. He asked me for a date, and I told him any date is fine and he chose October 9 for the inauguration,” he said. Opposition leader in the legislative council Praveen Darekar objected to the government omitting former CM Devendra Fadnavis’s name from the list of guests on the invite.

As per procedure, we keep inmates in this cell for three to five days before shifting them to the regular cells.” The cell, located on the first floor of the ground-plus two-storey building, can accommodate 25 inmates. It has a toilet, fans and lights. The cell is guarded by armed jail police personnel. The official capacity of the 1925-built Arthur Road jail, also known as the Mumbai Central Prison, is around 800, but is at present housing more than 2,500 inmates. Since May 2021, 319 prisoners have tested Covid positive. While 308 were treated, one inmate died. Ten others are still undergoing treatment. As many as 67 jail staffers (police personnel) tested positive of which 66 have recovered, while one is still recuperating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-srks-son-and-5-others-kept-in-quarantine-cell-at-city-jail/articleshow/86879423.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Gurwinder Singh, 19, had dropped out of school and turned to his faith to help the poor. Both sons of farmer families died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Sunday. Their mothers have not recovered and, now, district health officials are monitoring their condition. On Thursday, while asking the UP government to file a status report on the investigation of the violence, the Supreme Court had in its order said, “The mother of deceased Mr Lovepreet Singh is in critical condition, due to shock of loss of her son, and an oral prayer has been made to provide her best medical treatment. In view of the above, we direct the learned Additional Advocate General to look into the matter personally and provide best medical treatment to the mother of the deceased in a reputed Government Medical College/Hospital at UP.” At Bhagwantnagar in Lakhimpur Kheri, Lovepreet’s mother Sarvjeet Kaur has barely spoken a word since he died. “She has stopped eating, talking, responding. She has gone into depression after losing her son,” Lovepreet’s father Satnam Singh told TOI. “My two daughters are taking care of her. Our relatives are trying to help. But I don’t know how she will recover.” On Friday morning, the district health department had sent a doctor to check on her. “A team of doctors will be visiting Lovepreet’s family. Psychiatrist Dr Akhilesh Shukla checked her condition and found she is suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. He has advised the family to ensure no crowd gathers around her and that no one reminds her of what happened. It may worsen her condition,” Kheri chief medical officer Dr Shailendra Bhatnagar told TOI. “We will continue to monitor her.” At Nanpara in the neighbouring district of Bahraich, Daljeet Kaur, too, is struggling with her son’s loss. “She was alone at home when she found out Gurwinder had died,” Gurwinder’s brother Gursevak told TOI. Gursevak was in Punjab for visa-related procedures and his father Sukhwinder was in Varanasi for work. A team of doctors was sent by the district administration to check her condition on Thursday night. “She has gone into shock. Gurwinder was the closest to mother. She keeps asking why he was murdered when he never hurt anyone. We don’t have an answer."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/mothers-of-2-young-farmers-who-died-battle-depression-docs-monitoring/articleshow/86879550.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Night bazaar along Hussainsagar soon||HYDERABAD: After kicking off the ‘Sunday-Funday’ programme on Tank Bund, the municipal administration department is now gearing up to set up a ‘night bazaar’ around Hussainsagar. Though a decision has been taken last year itself, the department could not go ahead with the plan due to Covid-19 pandemic. Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao informed this during a short discussion on Pattana Pragati in the legislative council on Friday. Officials of Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) have identified about 1,300-metre stretch along the lake for development to convert into a tourist spot. The HMDA is planning to set up retail units with proposed pre-fabricated fibre reinforced plastic (FRP). The GHMC, a few years ago, had planned similar night bazaar in the Old City as part of Charminar Pedestrianisation Project (CPP), but could not take it up. As part of the project, officials are planning a wood plastic composite (WPC) deck along the shoreline to enhance the ambience at the lake. “Previous governments focused on certain and prioritised fields. But, the TRS government has been adopting a wholistic and an inclusive approach on development. While giving priority for industries and IT sector, special programmes were taken up as part of Palle Pragati and Pattan Pragati. Even green cover enhancements were given priority,” KTR said. He listed out the programmes taken up by the government in Greater Hyderabad and HMDA limits and other municipalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/night-bazaar-along-hsagar-soon/articleshow/86879173.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB let off BJP neta’s brother-in-law, alleges Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Friday stepped up his attack against the Narcotics Control Bureau, saying the agency had illegally freed two persons, including the brother-in-law of a high-profile BJP leader, following the raid on the cruise liner. Malik said that initially, NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede had stated that eight to 10 persons on the ship had been detained, but later in court, it was stated that only eight persons were detained for possessing banned drugs. “It can’t be eight or 10, it must be either eight or 10. I am surprised over the vague statement made by Wankhede. My information is that ten persons were detained on October 2 after the much-publicized raid. However, two of them were freed for obvious political reasons. One of the freed persons is the brother-in-law of a high-profile BJP leader. I will release a complete video of the entire episode on Saturday,” Malik said. Malik said prima facie, it appears that the NCB has launched a campaign to defame the MVA government as well as the film industry. “I have information about the second person too, who was first detained and then freed. The second person is the organizer of the event, who called everyone to the cruise ship. Initially, he was detained but later freed with the relative of the BJP leader. Certainly, I will expose the NCB,” Malik said. Malik reiterated that NCB’s actions are aimed at harassing film personalities, and from Rhea Chakraborty to Deepika Padukone, he alleged it had acted only against people in whose cases it received maximum publicity. “My contention is that most of the cases registered by the NCB were fake, as there was no recovery. Even the October 2 raid, where Aryan Khan was arrested, appears fake and fabricated. Following the arrest of Shah Rukh Khan’s son, the NCB is getting worldwide publicity,” Malik said. Malik alleged again that during the raid on the ship, there was violation of rules. “All goods were brought to the zonal director’s office, while the NCB has claimed that they were recovered from the accused. Our information is that no goods were seized from the spot or any home. Pictures released by NCB are from NCB’s office and not from the spot,” he claimed. Malik again questioned the presence of private persons as main witnesses. “One witness is absconding as per the records of Pune police, while another is an office-bearer of BJP,” Malik said. Sameer Wankhede declined to comment on the allegations made by Malik. “I have no comments,” Wankhede said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-let-off-bjp-netas-bro-in-law-alleges-malik/articleshow/86879548.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Zero tolerance zones to clear traffic hurdles on major routes||JAIPUR: Jaipur police will set up zero-tolerance zones (ZTZs) at important locations of the city for unimpeded vehicular movement. According to the additional commissioner of police, law and order, Rahul Prakash, all police stations have been instructed to earmark one major route where traffic moves at a snail’s pace due to congestion and bottlenecks. "Once a particular location is identified, police teams will examine the reasons that hinder traffic movement. SHOs will make plans to remove bottlenecks including illegal parking spots and encroachments," Prakash said. The zones will be guarded round-the-clock and hawkers and vendors will be removed from spilling onto the main roads. Similarly, efforts will be made to regularise haphazard traffic that also leads to major disruptions. The ambitious plan will be used as a learning lesson to study important factors that cause traffic congestion in Jaipur. Police said that the exercise will be undertaken next week. SHOs will also deploy their staff on important intersections so that traffic moves freely. "A local police station has a better understanding of intersections, market roads and pressure points that disrupt traffic. To relieve congestions, we need more localised solutions," Prakash said. Jaipur police and its traffic division have long been mulling over solutions that could resolve bottlenecks. Officials realised that a single plan may not be consistent for the entire city. Therefore, regular monitoring by a local police station may help resolve the problems. "Several major roads of Jaipur are hemmed in by encroachments. At other places, haphazard parking brings peak time traffic to a halt. Therefore, local SHOs are better equipped to deal with the problem," an official said. Jaipur police has asked SHOs to identify the roads where traffic disruptions have become rampant. "Once the list is sent to us, we will provide whatever help we can from the commissionerate," the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/zero-tolerance-zones-to-clear-traffic-hurdles-on-major-routes/articleshow/86879232.cms||---

---||Dehradun||World Hospice & Palliative Care Day: U’khand’s only hospice tending to terminally-ill patients free of cost for 16 years||Dehradun: For the past 16 years, Ganga Prem Hospice (GPH), a palliative care centre along the banks of the Ganga at Gohri Mafi village between Dehradun and Rishikesh, has been providing free-of-cost medical care to terminally ill patients.Founded by noted cancer surgeon Dr Ajay Dewan, GPH, a charity-driven organisation, has tended to more than 15,000 patients from all across India. A majority of these patients were in the last stages of cancer. “No charges are taken from the patients and all expenses of the organisation are borne out of donations”, said Dr Taranjit Singh, chief medical officer of the hospice. With the World Hospice & Palliative Care Day being observed on Saturday (October 9), a visit to GPH, which is Uttarakhand's only end-of-life cancer care inpatient service facility, provides an insight on how loving care and empathy can be given along with top-notch palliative care to those, for whom life is slowly ebbing away. “We often come across patients who are in such a stage of their illness that it is difficult to do much for them, either by conventional hospitals or even by their relatives or loved ones. For instance, managing pain is a critical requirement for terminally ill patients. We try to help in that,” said Dr Singh. “In India, 70% of cancer diagnosis come at a stage when the disease is already in its advanced stages. When hospitals close their doors to patients, that’s when we step in to ensure that the remaining period of the patient’s life is as comfortable as possible. The idea is to provide social, emotional and spiritual support, which terminally ill patients require the most,” Pooja Dogra, co-ordinator of GPH, said. She added that often, emotional support and counselling is essential for terminally ill patients. “I remember a particularly poignant case where both a mother and her son were terminally ill with cancer. The son passed away before the mother and it required a great deal of counselling to keep the mother going for the rest of her days.” The hospice staff also provides home care facility to several patients in cities like Dehradun, Haridwar and Rishikesh. During the peak of Covid-19, they had also stepped in to help those affected by the pandemic. “During Covid-induced lockdown, our team helped in organising cremations and took care of the children of the terminally ill patients. Our team members also reached out to people with ration kits and medical supplies,” said Dr Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/world-hospice-palliative-care-day-ukhands-only-hospice-tending-to-terminally-ill-patients-free-of-cost-for-16-years/articleshow/86879667.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Jaipur||‘Wind energy to be available at Rs 2.44/unit’||Jaipur. Wind power will be available at Rs 2.44/unit from four wind plants of the state. At the same time, two new plants for biomass-based power generation will be set up.Additional Chief Secretary Energy Subodh Aggarwal said that this rate has been fixed through tender through Solar Energy Corporation (SECI), which will be the lowest rate for wind power purchase. He said that earlier, power was being purchased from these plants at the rate of Rs 5.71 under the contract. The rate is fixed afresh after the completion of the contract period. Aggarwal disclosed this in the meeting of the board of directors of Rajasthan Energy Development Corporation. He said that after the expiry of the contract period of RSMML, FFR Software, Amazon Power LALP and Ushdev Engitech, electricity will now be available at the rate of Rs 2.44. This has paved the way for getting electricity at a cheaper rate in the coming time in the event of continuation of further production in the state from other power projects which are to be completed in the coming time. He informed that two biomass power projects will be set up in the state near Fagi in Jaipur district and Chhatarpur in Bikaner. About 22.9 MW of electricity will be generated from these projects. He said that according to the demand of electricity in the state, a comparative study would be conducted to strengthen the monitoring system of purchase and sale rates so that the system could be made more effective. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wind-energy-to-be-available-at-rs-2-44/unit/articleshow/86879231.cms||---

He will surely be elected our PM again in 2024.” Shah was speaking at a public gathering at Pansar village, about 23km from state capital Gandhinagar ahead of his visit to his ancestral village Mansa to take part in Navratri aarti at Bahuchar Mata temple – a tradition he follows for years. Shah also inaugurated multiple projects in his Lok Sabha constituency. Shah takes part in aarti at Bahuchar Mata temple, a tradition he has been following for years“In past two decades, I have not seen him take a holiday. However good the work he might have done, he always asks for what’s remaining. He has made people’s problems his own,” Shah said about PM Modi. Shah said Modi’s seven years are better than 70 years of earlier rule as he helped open 60 crore bank accounts, get LPG connections to 13 crore homes, construct 10 crore toilets, provide electricity to 5 crore families and cover 60 crore for Rs 5 lakh health insurance. Taking a dig at the opposition, Shah said that it’s the good works that helped BJP win the recently concluded Gandhinagar municipal corporation elections. “(The voters) sent them back beaten and bruised. They are seen nowhere across the state. It’s the sanskaar of Narendrabhai’s work and result of public-centric good governance that is giving win to BJP in Gujarat and across India,” said Shah. Earlier, Shah visited Gandhinagar railway station and inaugurated a tea stall run by a self-help women’s group that serves tea in kullads. Shah instructed the local administration to give impetus to the potter community. He also placed an order of 5,000 cups. Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Bhupendra Patel enjoy a cup of tea in GandhinagarShah asked the SHG to increase production of clay tea cups so the government can phase out plastic cups. “I want you to encourage others to take up pottery. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also floated a scheme wherein potters get electric pottery wheels, which reduces labour. I want each village under Gandhinagar constituency to have such electric pottery wheels. The district collector will make sure of its availability,” Shah said. “The administration will make sure your products (tea cups) get sold. Railways will buy your clay cups. This will not only give employment, but also help in reducing plastic,” Shah told the SHG members. At Pansar, he inaugurated a PHC and laid the foundation of a lake beautification project. Shah also inaugurated a PSA oxygen plant at Premswarup Swami Multispeciality Hospital and Swaminarayan International School in Saij in Kalol taluka. Snake causes flutter at meeting:A couple of minutes before Amit Shah stood up to talk, there was a lot of commotion towards the rear end of the pandal, and people were seen scampering to safety. It turned out that a snake had slithered into the meeting venue. However, order was restored within a couple of minutes as the reptile went into nearby bushes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pm-will-win-in-2024-shah/articleshow/86879333.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bengali diaspora readies for Durga Puja at home away from home||KOLKATA: After missing out on last year’s Durga Puja, when all congregations were cancelled due to the pandemic, Bengalis settled abroad are eagerly waiting for the next two weekends to celebrate the festival, which will bring back a touch of Bengal in faraway lands. While some will celebrate the Puja on October 9-10, others will choose the following weekend, October 16-17. But at Washington Kali Temple in Burtonsville, the rituals will be held according to the Bengali almanac. Nandini Bhattacharya Ghosh, who lives in Olney Maryland and works as a federal employee in the Greater Maryland Washington DC area, has booked slots on two days at the temple. “I will go on Ashtami and Dashami for anjali and sindoor khela. They are allocating 20 minutes to each family of six persons this year. I intend to take my flu shot or a booster dose if available before that,” she says. Nandini, who grew up in Salt Lake, Kolkata, misses pandal-hopping as well as trips to her village at Talit in Burdwan, where the Bhattacharya family’s 350-year-old Puja is still held with fervour . Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, who lives in Houston, Texas, says the Bengali and Indian community is especially enthusiastic about the Puja this year as everyone had to give the annual ritual a miss in 2020. The Puja will be held at Bayou City Houston Durgabari. “Since we have established deities, priests and volunteers conducted the Puja in 2020 but no visitor came. This year, we plan to revive the festivity, but with utmost safety,” says Chatterjee, chairman of the trust. This year’s theme is ‘Joy Korechhi Atimaari, Pujoy Abar Durgabari’, created by Srabani Akilla of Houston, chosen in a contest by poet Srijato. “We have moved the anjali outside. Only registered people with fully vaccinated status or negative Covid tests will be allowed,” he says. Shreya Guhathakurta, Suchismita and Rex D’Souza will perform in person, while a virtual concert by Debu Mishra will rock Durgabari stage. At the UK’s Royal Berkshire Bengali Association (RBBA), the mood is one of cautious optimism. “As all rules have been relaxed and over 80% people are double-vaccinated, the community is looking forward to meeting and celebrating. We hope things will only get better with Ma Durga’s blessings,” says RBBA secretary and founder member Atanu Dutta. “The footfall at our Puja over five days is around 10,000.” The Puja draws Indians from Oxford and Birmingham. Danseuse Sohini Roychowdhury, who will travel from Kolkata to London with her dance opera ‘Shakti Rupena’, is excited about performing at London University’s SOAS and then at Hessen/ Rhein-Main Area, Germany. Sitarist and composer Jonathan Mayer’s Raga Durga will embellish the opera in the London show. In Wellington, New Zealand, the 100-odd Bengalis there will celebrate the Puja only for a day due to the recent spread of the novel coronavirus’s Delta variant in Auckland. Arpan Mukherjee, who works with the New Zealand government, says he is feeling nostalgic again, just like he used to miss Kolkata’s Puja when he shifted there a decade ago. “We have got used to celebrating here. But this time, each family will get only 10 minutes at the Puja. Given the restrictions, one suddenly yearns for the Puja back home,” says Mukherjee. Debanjan Chakrabarti, director of British Council (east and northeast India), says Durga Puja has grown into one of the biggest festivals in Asia, even possibly the world. “I have been part of Durga Puja in the UK since I was a student, taking part in the festival at Liverpool, Manchester, Bury and Kirkcaldy (Scotland) and seen the scale of celebrations grow. The festivities attract not just Bengalis but also the locals. In 2018, when the British Council presented a photography exhibition, ‘Bengal’s Durga’, at South Bank, London, as part of the Totally Thames Festival, almost 3 lakh people visited over 6 weeks. In 2019, British Council partnered with Bengal Heritage Foundation to promote educational and cultural links between Bengal and the UK. Audiences in London and Cardiff were mesmerised by folk musicians (baul) from Bengal,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengali-diaspora-readies-for-puja-at-home-away-from-home/articleshow/86879610.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The power unit will generate 1.584 crore units of electricity per day. With this, the power generation capacity of the plant increased from 7937.35MW to 8597.35 MW. Two Suratgarh supercritical 660 MW power units were approved by the state government on March 2, 2009. The Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited was given the work order for the project in March 2013. State energy minister BD Kalla congratulated the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam. Kalla said due to the tireless efforts of the employees, the synchronization of this unit on coal began on March 23, 2021, and the power generation on full load started on August 30 this year. The energy minister said due to the non-availability of resources and materials amid the coronavirus pandemic the construction works got delayed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-suratgarh-thermal-power-unit-begins-ops/articleshow/86879225.cms||---

Usually, RDPs and SDPs are needed for blood cancer patients. Hence, such donors are not readily available. As more dengue patients are complaining of deterioration in the platelets, people are taking to social media looking for donors. "We mostly need RDPs and SDPs for cancer patients and for people with gynaecological issues. Since dengue cases are on the rise, the demand for RDPs and SDPs has just doubled," said Dr Amit Sharma, in-charge of the blood bank at SMS Hospital. The doctor said they were providing 100 to 150 RDPs and 6 to 10 SDPs every day at their hospital. "Extracting SDPs is a lengthy procedure, wherein the donor needs to be at the blood bank for at least two hours. The donor must be healthy and have a good platelet count. After one SDP donation, a person can again go for it after 72 hours," Sharma said. Physicians hospitals across the city said that there was an increase in the number of outpatient department visitors, who complained of fever and ended up getting diagnosed with Dengue. The doctors said people were struggling to get platelets for their near and dear ones. "I volunteered to give SDPs to my mother, but I was told that I am not fit to donate. I had circulated messages via social media among my family, friends and office colleagues," said Sujata Agarwal, whose mother is admitted at the SMS Hospital with platelet count as low as 15,000. "It was a while before a man finally volunteered to donate," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dengue-spurs-platelet-demand-puts-pressure-on-blood-banks/articleshow/86879269.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Covid lurks, but Durga Puja may see bigger crowds than 2020||HYDERABAD: A year after subdued Durga Puja celebrations, Bengali cultural organisations in the city are hoping that 2021 will see a more festive atmosphere at the puja mandap. While elaborate arrangements are in place for devotees, keeping in mind warnings about an impending third wave of Covid-19, organisers agree that the rigorous pace of vaccination has allowed them to notch up the scale of celebrations over last year. “Most devotees want to come to our puja as we are the oldest,” said Sumit Sen, general-secretary of Hyderabad Bangalee Samity, which marks its 80th Durga Puja festivities this year. “But not more than 50 devotees will be allowed inside the mandap at a time and 100 persons on the premises. We will have barricades outside the venue and volunteers to help with crowd control. The idol too is smaller in size.” Other organisers have followed suit with smaller-sized idols and capping the number of people in line with government regulations. The Bangiya Sanskritik Sangha, said president Deepak Bhattacharya has made two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine mandatory to enter the venue. Entry to the puja organised by the Utsab Cultural Association in Gachibowli will also be regulated by a two-dose certificate or a negative RT-PCR test result, said general-secretary Krishnendu Roy, agreeing that while they anticipate a larger crowd this year, different time slots will be allotted to devotees. In Narsingi, Chiranjeet Ghosh, secretary of Uttaran Bangiya Samiti, which is organising its fourth Durga Puja, said, “We have a separate area for children and are encouraging elderly devotees to avoid peak times.” “Before the pandemic we would see between 5,000 to 6,000 visitors a day for our ‘bhog’. In 2020, we came down to 300 visitors a day, but this year we expect a footfall of around 500 on each day of the festival,” said Sanjay Bose, executive committee member of Bengalee Cultural Association, Masab Tank. “We hope this will be a better year. After all, Durga Puja is a matter of sentiment among the community.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-lurks-but-durga-puja-may-see-bigger-crowds-than-20/articleshow/86879223.cms||---
---||Delhi||Herbal hookahs: 2 days to govt to reconsider order||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday granted two days’ time to the health and family welfare department of Delhi government to reconsider its order prohibiting the use of herbal hookah in public places to contain the spread of Covid-19. Justice Rekha Palli, hearing a batch of petitions by restaurants seeking a direction to authorities to not interfere with the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs, directed that an affidavit be filed by the department after reconsideration, and posted the plea for October 18. Last month, the court had directed the government to ask Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to reconsider the issue. Delhi government counsel Santosh Tripathi informed the court that since the August 3 order, which prohibited the use of herbal hookah in public places was passed by the principal secretary, health and family welfare department, DDMA could not have reconsidered it. Unimpressed by this stand, the court responded that the direction for reconsideration was issued to Delhi government, which is now taking a technical stand. “This court is unable to appreciate the stand as GNCTD (Delhi government) is the first respondent and was expected to reconsider the issue,” the judge stated as it granted further time to the Delhi government to take a decision. “The matter has been adjourned from time to time... In the interest of justice, two days’ time is granted to the department to reconsider the order,” the judge said, pointing out that “You are opening Ramlila. You are opening everything.” But the counsel stated that removing restrictions on hookahs was “not the same” as masks are required to be taken off to use them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/herbal-hookahs-2-days-to-govt-to-reconsider-order/articleshow/86879087.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Bus operators cash in on Hyderabad-AP Dasara rush||HYDERABAD: With no regulation on ticket prices for private bus operators, going home this festive season has become an expensive affair for passengers travelling between Hyderabad to several places in AP. Passengers trying to book tickets say that there is a 50% hike in fares after many private bus operators stalled online bookings to create a temporary shortage and drive up prices. “I tried to book tickets to Vijayawada on Friday morning on the internet. When the seats on the bus I usually book were already filled, I went to the ticket booking office in Ameerpet where I was charged Rs 800 extra for the ticket,” said Shashank Kumar, a resident of Sanathnagar. Around 4,000 contract carriage (a motor vehicle which carries a passenger or passengers for hire or reward) buses and nearly 1,000 line buses (a bus that takes a particular route) operate from Hyderabad. Thousands of people working in Hyderabad are preparing to return to their hometowns in AP to celebrate the upcoming Dasara festival with their families. Stating that the private bus operators are cashing in on the sentiment of passengers, many said that the government should create some guidelines for the private operators. “I have been paying two or three times the price of actual ticket fare every year during the festive season. The government should put a stop to this practice,” said B Rajkumar, a Kukatpally resident. M Sunil Kumar Reddy, owner of Orange Travels said, “The number of passengers taking the buses this season has increased compared to last year when the situation was grim due to Covid-19. Our price is limited to maximum 1.5 times of the regular price.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bus-operators-cash-in-on-hyd-ap-dasara-rush/articleshow/86879196.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 25% rise in personal loan ticket size in Covid year, says report||AHMEDABAD: With people battling income shortage after the lockdown of 2020, the uptakes of personal loans went up, along with the average ticket size. According to a report by credit bureau, CRIF Highmark, personal loan ticket size in Gujarat went up 25% in the pandemic year. Personal loan ticket size extended by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) went up from Rs 77,280 in 2019-20 to Rs 96,390 in 2020-21. CRIF’s data suggests that while personal loan ticket size went up, NPA also went up from 1.06% to 1.92%. The sharp decline in ticket size is also considered as a measure to curb NPAs. “Lenders want to serve higher ticket size customers to bring the NPA in control and improve the quality of the portfolio. In Gujarat, the average ticket size sharply declined between 2019 to 2020, however, this also increased the NPA of this portfolio,” said Vipul Jain, vice president – product management & business intelligence, CRIF High Mark. NBFC players attribute the rise in ticket size of personal loans availed by professionals and businesses soon after the lockdown to cashflow needs for business and household purposes. “The Covid-19 pandemic induced financial constraints that made the last 18 months one of the most challenging time of our lives. Economic downturn coupled by job losses dealt a big blow to many. Our Borrower Pulse Report launched in March 2021 indicates that a strong sense of resilience was shown by youth of Ahmedabad city in deciding to take complete control of their financial future. The entrepreneurial spirit showcased by such a large percentage of borrowers — who opted to start their own businesses during the pandemic — led to growth in average-ticket size of loan applications from the city,” said Gaurav Chopra, Founder & CEO, IndiaLends. According to the previous report by the credit bureau, personal loans across India have witnessed a 23% surge in the number of women borrowers in the first nine months of 2020-21 i.e. from April to December 2020. Banks also witnessed a similar trend in terms of personal loan uptakes during the pandemic year. “During the pandemic year, people had to meet with emergency medical expenditures. Many even lost their jobs or faced a steep decline in their business or individual revenues due to which the uptake for personal loans increased,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/25-rise-in-personal-loan-ticket-size-in-covid-year/articleshow/86879040.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Goa||Goa governor brings his office under RTI Act, gives nod for new Raj Bhavan||PANAJI: Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai on Friday took two major decisions concerning his office and residence—he brought the institution of Goa governor under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and approved the construction of a new Raj Bhavan. “I would like to publicly declare my policy that governors are bound to furnish information to people, and people are supreme. Hereafter, right to information (RTI) with respect to Raj Bhavan will be available to all citizens,” he said. Pillai said though Raj Bhavan has got certain exemptions, but he had gone through the Constitution before deciding to bring it under the purview of the RTI Act. “The Raj Bhavan is not a power centre, and of course they (governors) are nominated posts. The post of chief minister is an elected one, he is selected by the people of the state. So, the power centre is always the government,” Pillai said. The governor also accepted the state government’s proposal for a new Raj Bhavan and said he had gone through some objections raised when the proposal was put before the governor’s office earlier. “Our CM has put a proposal before me for a Raj Bhavan as a (new) residence of the governor and to make this ancient, prestigious Raj Bhavan open to the public as a monument. I accept the offer of the CM” he said. On August 1, 2020, former governor Satya Pal Malik rejected the state’s proposal to construct a new Raj Bhavan. Malik wrote a strong letter to Sawant, who was planning the new Raj Bhavan, and said it was “irrational and imprudent” to even think of it when the state is reeling under an acute financial crisis amid the pandemic. Malik had also clarified to Sawant that “his requirement for functioning as a governor is very limited and he does not require any new Raj Bhavan building per se”. On July 24, 2020, Sawant, after a meeting with chief secretary Parimal Rai and PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar, had told TOI that PWD had said it was difficult to maintain the (current) Raj Bhavan, and hence, the state government was in the process of identifying land for a new Raj Bhavan, and it would be tendered by April 2021. Meanwhile, Pillai disbursed financial assistance to old age homes, orphanages and other such institutions and persons undergoing dialysis. The function was attended by CM Pramod Sawant, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, revenue minister Jenifer Monserrate, Sadguru Brahmeshanand Acharya Swami, Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-guv-brings-his-office-under-rti-act-gives-nod-for-new-raj-bhavan/articleshow/86879234.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Businessman duped of Rs 45 lakh with loan lure||AHMEDABAD: A textile businessman from Vasna has filed a police complaint stating that five people have duped him of Rs 45 lakh by luring him with the prospect of a loan of up to Rs 10 crore. Jagdish Chandel, 55, of Sahaj Sapiens in Vasna, filed the complaint with the local police on Thursday. He said that he had come in contact with Amrut Desai who promised a loan of Rs 2.50 crore at nominal interest. Desai claimed that he worked at a private bank which could give a business loan at the annual interest of about 5%. The catch was that Chandel had to pay some money to facilitate the process. Chandel paid Desai about Rs 1.55 lakh between May 20, 2016, and October 15, 2016. Later Desai introduced Chandel to Dhiru Vaghela who also sought money from Chandel to get the disbursal process going. Chandel gave Vaghela about Rs 1.75 lakh between March 15, 2017, and July 7, 2017. Desai and Vaghela then introduced Chandel to Rakesh Sathwara who claimed that he knew a bureaucrat who could help get a loan of Rs 5 crore. Chandel gave Sathwara Rs 24 lakh between July 23, 2017, and July 23, 2018. Despite paying all the ‘facilitation fees’, no loan was forthcoming. At this stage, Desai introduced Chandel to Suresh Badshah who promised to get Chandel a loan of Rs 10 crore. Chandel was, of course, told that money will have to be paid to get the loan sanctioned. Chandel gave Rs 17 lakh to Badshah between July 2018 and January 2021. Now Desai introduced Chandel to Anand Kumar who made a ‘field visit’ to Chandel’s business in Khadia and took Rs 2 lakh as bribe. At last Chandel filed the complaint of cheating and breach of trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bizman-duped-of-rs-45l-with-loan-lure/articleshow/86879448.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||15 projects worth Rs 1,200 crore to ease bottlenecks in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: With an eye on improving the city’s civic Infrastructure by leaps and bound, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has proposed a slew of development projects across the city. Among the projects that are going to be taken up in a phased manner, the GHMC in coordination with South Central Railway (SCR) has proposed over 15 projects worth Rs 1,200 crore. The projects include new road under bridges (RuBs) and road over bridges (RoBs) at several locations in order to find a solution for the ever-increasing traffic problems in the city. Over time, the level crossings have become a major hassle considering the increasing number of vehicles in the city. At least 13 such projects are located in the northern part of the city, three in the southern part and two in the central part of the city. “The plan is to completely remove manned level crossings (MLCs) in the GHMC limits. Most of these projects are already underway in parts of the city under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP). The state government has decided to coordinate with SCR officials and build these projects,” said a GHMC official. Locations of level crossings where RoBs have been proposed include Mettuguda, Moula Ali, Moula Ali station, Malkajgiri, Safilguda, Patigadda, between Bolarum and Gundla Pochampally stations, Kakatiya Nagar, Vinayak Nagar, near Suchitra and Venkatapuram in Old Alwal, between Falaknuma and Budvel, and near Rajbhavan and Khairatabad. This apart, the civic body has also set a deadline to complete at least 10 foot over-bridges (FOBs) in the city by this year-end. “After conducting a survey in places where these foot over-bridges are planned, it has been decided that about 10 foot over-bridges will be completed by this year-end, while another 15 foot over-bridges will be completed next year,” said M Devanand, GHMC chief engineer (maintenance). Infinity Mall near Chandanagar, ESI Hospital at Erragadda, NSKK at Balanagar, Neredmet crossroads, Central Mall at Panjagutta, GVK Mall at Banjara Hills, Swapna theatre at Katedhan, St Anns-Secunderabad, St Anns-Tarnaka and My Home Jewel at Miyapur are the 10 areas where the FOBs will be completed in the next two months by December-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/15-projects-worth-rs-1200cr-to-ease-bottlenecks-in-city/articleshow/86879193.cms||Moulika.KV

A biker was swept away in the rain water when he accidentally fell in the nala at a culvert Chintalkunta area of Vanasthalipuram on Friday night. Luckily he was pulled out by the locals at some distance but as he left the place, abandoning his bike, police continued the search till 11.30 pm when they got a confirmation that he escaped with minor injuries. According to the Telangana State Devlopment Planning Society figures upto 11 pm, Ameerpet recorded highest rainfall of 141.3 mm followed by 130.8 mm at Lingojiguda, 120.8 mm at Kurmaguda, 112.8mm at LB Nagar, 110.3mm at South Hasthinapuram, 108.5mm at Asmangad, 105.8mm at Viratnagar among others. Many other areas such as Uppal, Begum Bazar, Kanchanbagh, Nampally, Hayathnagar, Rein Bazar, Attapur, Rajendra Nagar were lashed with 40-100mm of rains. Meteorologists termed it a localised thunderstorm due to formation of strong cumulonimbus clouds over central parts of Telangana following movement of the low-pressure area from the Arabian Sea towards coastal AP. The sudden cloudburst triggered heavy inundation, as several low-lying regions and roads turned into rivulets within a short span of time. As the intense rain led to visibility dropping, motorists were forced to take shelter on road sides and under flyovers until the rains subsided. Several people took to Twitter to ask people to stay indoors as several roads were water-logged. The Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing of GHMC issued an alert on social media platform Twitter, urging people to take precautions during their commute. “Cloud systems formed in and around the city leading to heavy sporadic rainfall. Sudden showers expected to continue for the next one hour,” EVDM officials tweeted.

However, on the first day, it received a lukewarm response from the beneficiaries as only 4.36L doses were administered.The state has 8,196 vaccination sites, including 8,139 in the government sector and 57 in the private sector. Health department officials were surprised with the low turnout but maintained that in the rural areas farmers are into harvesting their crops while Navratri festivity where many people observe fast could be the reason that has become a deterrent. “We got 8,136 sites and were prepared to administer as high as 15 lakh doses today. It appears that in the rural interiors people are busy in the harvesting their crops while things like Navratri where many observe fast could be the deterrent as we managed to administer 4,35,939 doses,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination while talking to TOI. He added that state still has at least 40 lakh doses as on Friday 7.07 lakh doses of Covishield and 1 lakh doses of Covaxin have also been received. “Till Friday we have administered 59,814,615 doses which included 7,386,915 doses of Covaxin and 52,427,700 doses of Covidshield,” he added. Meanwhile, the vaccination sites at Jaipur were also empty and had no rush. “Post September 15 there has not been a mad rush as vaccine is easily available,” said an officer with the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lukewarm-response-to-mega-covid-vax-camp/articleshow/86879295.cms||---

Rest of the population is hesitantly taking vaccines. Those who are interested have already taken the doses,’’ said Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, who led a full bench, in a suo motu PIL to protect those unable to access justice during the Covid-19 pandemic. The bench said from October 12, the interim protective order will cease to operate except in five districts — Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara, Osmanabad and Ratnagiri — where the number of positive cases is high. For these districts, protection shall extend till October 21. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni gave a chart showing that between September 29 and October 5, the positivity rate in the state was 2%, and 1.2% in Mumbai. He pointed out that admissions and critical cases are on a decline. Advocate Uday Warunjikar said the protective order must be extended for two weeks, since citizens in Mumbai must take both doses followed by a 14-day gap to avail public transport.

---||Ahmedabad||Whirl closes into small, warm circle||Ahmedabad: This year’s Navratri began its swirl on a small, intimate, personal, and hyperlocal note bringing glamour back to sheri garba. Instead of being lost in a big crowd at clubs and party plots, garba enthusiasts often enjoy twirling to dance beats in small gatherings comprising friends and family, especially in this pandemic age. As the state government has banned commercial garba events this Navratri, several people in the city have organized small-scale garba with whittled down guest lists at their bungalow lawns and farmhouses. For instance, Parul Patel, a resident of Science City Road, said: “I had hosted a small garba gathering of family and friends at our farmhouse on the first Navratri night itself.” Patel added: “We had a beautiful celebration.” Besides individuals hosting friends and family, several corporate houses are holding by-invitation-only events at private venues. A number of musicians have collaborated with private groups. Sagar Shah, co-founder of an event designing firm, said: “Since the events are small-scale and hosted for friends and family, people are going all out as far as décor and catering are concerned.” Shah added: “Budgets have surely gone up this year for such garba gatherings and our clients seek unique, traditional themes.” Yet another Ahmedabad resident, Janki Vakil, plans to host an event next week at her farmhouse. “We have invited 100-150 guests in line with the Covid-19 protocols to enjoy the Navratri revelry.” Vakil added: “It is not just safe but also fun to enjoy the festivities with your own group of friends. We’ve called a troupe from Himachal Pradesh to perform the Ganga aarti at our home.” Garba enthusiasts feel a lot safer attending small-scale events especially in the ongoing pandemic. “Because of the pandemic, we are mindful about the Covid-19 protocols,” said Rajeshwari Jain, a resident of Sindhu Bhavan Road. “Attending a small gathering is always safe since it involves a known circle of friends and family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/whirl-closes-into-small-warm-circle/articleshow/86879167.cms||---

The government, however, has excluded the graduating batch of junior resident doctors, who passed out last month and have been working in Covid wards since the outbreak in March 2020 till June 31, 2021 - the end of their residency. The government resolution, issued on October 6, mentions that the token amount will be given to only those resident doctors – junior and senior – who are currently in service. The ones who worked extensively for over 15 months are now feeling short-changed. The GR was issued in response to the protest staged by the resident doctors last week. In view of their academic loss, the doctors had demanded a fee waiver. Since fee waiver was not a viable option, the government had agreed to give the resident doctors (postgraduate medical students) an allowance. The GR said that postgraduate students from government and civic-run medical colleges (resident doctors), and postgraduate doctors from government Ayurveda colleges, who have contributed during the pandemic period will be given this token amount as an acknowledgement of their work. One of the doctors, who passed out from a government hospital, said that it is unfair to exclude them from the allowance. “We are not resident doctors anymore, but we faced the pandemic at a time when there was fear in the society and even among our faculty members. We have worked extensively in Covid wards, many suffered from the infection, but were back on duty immediately after recovering. Our exams were postponed thrice just to ensure that there are enough doctors to work in the pandemic, but while giving an acknowledgement, we are not being considered,” said the doctor. While the resident doctors from civic-run medical colleges got an incentive of Rs 10,000 for their Covid duty, a large number of resident doctors from state’s government-run colleges did not get any incentive, said another doctor. He added that the first year PG students are yet to join college on account of the delays in conduct of NEET-PG, so they have technically not worked in the pandemic at all. An official, however, said that government directives are always applicable prospectively. “We appreciate and are grateful for their contribution during the pandemic. We have held their work in high regard, but there are technical limitations. The directive will be effective from today and cannot be applied retrospectively,” said the official, adding that the GR has been issued after a lot of deliberations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-resident-docs-graduating-batch-wont-get-govts-rs-1l/articleshow/86879501.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Early birds’ rush to avoid crowd leads to crowding at pandals on Tritiya||KOLKATA: Saptarshi Nath, who studies at Presidency University and stays in Behala, rushed to Sreebhumi Sporting on Friday to catch a glimpse of Burj Khalifa of Kolkata. He was one among the nine from his batch to brave the sporadic rain and traffic snarls to reach the pandal. Nath reflected the mood of thousands, many of them youngsters, who did a whirlwind tour of Puja pandals on Friday to avoid crowds. But on reaching Sreebhumi, he was taken aback by the crowd that had already gathered. “I could only see a sea of heads. It seemed as though people had had enough and thrown caution to the wind to reach the pandal,” he said. At Ekdalia Evergreen, club volunteers managing the crowd were tired by late evening as curious shoppers attempted to bypass the noentry board and take a peep into the pandal. “Everyone claimed they were locals, and hence, had the right to enter. All they wanted was to click photographs. Some even argued the Calcutta HC had modified its order to allow more people in,” said an organizer. Cops, too, were badgered by the crowd on why they were not being allowed in. At Behala Natun Dal, club member Sandipan Bhattacharya said barricades with iron chains had to be installed to stop people from entering the main pandal. “The idol is easily visible from a distance. But people still want to push in. There is no question of breaking that rule,” he stated. Pintu Sengupta of 66 Pally said they, too, had received a steady stream of visitors. “We are not worried as the pandal has been designed in such a way that no one needs to enter. Everything is visible from the road,” he said. Pandal-hoppers and lastminute shoppers slowed down traffic on Gariahat, Hatibagan and New Market. VIP Road, too, was busy owing primarily to Sreebhumi and also because of the attractions at Dum Dum Park a few kilometres ahead. On Saturday, Central Avenue could experience heavy traffic as Pujas at Md Ali Park and Jagat Bandhu Park will be inaugurated. Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra said the force was ready with arrangements for both pandals and shopping zones on Chaturthi. “There will be 5,000 policemen on special duty. In addition, there will be deployment in the morning and late night. Even if there are more vehicles on the road than last year, it should not be a challenge,” said Mitra. He said policemen deployed at the pandals would check the vaccination status of those allowed entry into pandals for rituals. We will not allow overcrowding anywhere near the pandals,” said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/early-birds-rush-to-avoid-crowd-leads-to-crowding-at-pandals-on-tritiya/articleshow/86879505.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp report holds staff responsible for fund fraud||Thiruvananthapuram: The report submitted by the city corporation to the urban affairs directorate holds the cashier, the person who took the money to the bank and the charge officer culpable for the fraud committed in zonal offices. According to the report, the cashier is supposed to remit the tax and non-tax revenue received in an office the next day in the bank account of the corporation secretary in the nearest branch of SBI. Most often, it is not the cashier, but the peon or any other staff who deposits the money in the bank. Once the amount is remitted, the counterfoil of the challan with the bank seal is returned. This is certified by the charge officer and signed and pasted on the register. On the days where the payment never reached the bank account, the staff who carried the money did not deposit it in the bank and forged the bank’s counterfoils. The counterfoil without the bank seal was pasted on the register. This indicates that the cashier, the staff who carried the money and the charge officer/superintendent supposed to check the sealed counterfoils are equally culpable, the report says. The concurrent audit facility by the state audit department is available for the corporation. This is done once a year in zonal offices, however, due to Covid situation this audit was not carried out in 2020-21. The corporation has lost an amount of Rs 32.96 lakh and this needs to be recovered from the staff responsible for fraud. Departmental inquiry and police investigation are underway, the report says. The incident came to light when the charge officer reported a delay of one month in depositing Rs 1.74 lakh at Sreekaryam zonal office. Further audit showed that an amount of Rs 5.12 lakhs collected over six days between January 22 and July 6 at Sreekaryam zonal office was not reflected in the corporation account. At Nemom zonal office where the biggest fraud was committed, an amount of Rs 26.74 lakh went missing. This was collected between January 24, 2020, and July 14. One of the staff who was suspended at Nemom zonal office has told TOI that the amount was frequently carried to the bank by other staff. However, when the funds went missing, all the staff who used to carry money to the bank denied ever carrying the collection. Both the officials also failed to daily check the sealed counterfoil returned from the bank and paste it on the register. No record was also kept to monitor the person who carried the amount to the bank. TOI earlier carried a report to cite a case where a similar instance of fund missing was buried and the responsible staff was allotted casual leave when the cashier raised the issue that funds carried from the office were never deposited in the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-report-holds-staff-responsible-for-fund-fraud/articleshow/86849758.cms||Aswin J Kumar

To begin with, NTPC aims to reach out to its 200-home housing colony at Kawas near Surat by using about 100 cm/d of PNG where it will initially blend hydrogen to the extent of 5% for domestic use, to be later ramped up to 20%. “The residential township project will be the first of its kind in the country where we plan to blend green hydrogen in the city gas distribution (CGD) network. Once this is successful, we plan to roll it out in various cities and towns of India with our CGD partner,” said an official of NTPC aware of the development. He said that similar pilot projects have been carried out in countries like Australia and UK where they have been successful and are now awaiting commercial rollout. NTPC floated an EoI for Indian and global companies to set up the pilot project on green hydrogen blending with natural gas in the CGD, which received an overwhelming response, the official said. Through the EoI process, NTPC aims to identify companies capable of providing hydrogen blending solutions for the pilot project of 100 cm/d gas. Once the EoI process is over, NTPC will float a tender in the next two months or so. The successful bidder will have to design a blending system, select the technology for electrolyser and hydrogen storage system. In his latest Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stressed upon the importance of India to transform into a hydrogenbased economy while announcing the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission. The company aims to roll out the pilot project by the end of this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ntpc-gujarat-gas-to-blend-hydrogen-for-cgd-networks/articleshow/86879165.cms||Maulik Pathak

Cops advised that everyone should use ATM cards that are guarded, avoid using public Wi-Fi connections for transactions and use trusted e-commerce platforms. The awareness sessions of the outreach programme were addressed by the anti-bank fraud section OC, Neelkanta Roy, who focussed on the latest online bank fraud, and Kuntal Sidharth, an officer of cyber cell. Nearly 300 people attended the online programme, where cops cited the examples of digital crimes committed mostly on social media. They stressed the need to protect OTPs and passwords. Speaking on how the fraudsters lay their traps to dupe people, the cops referred to the recent WhatsApp hacking cases involving private bank employees and other frauds committed in the name of top restaurants and e-commerce portals. They also talked about a few cases, where the Wi-Fi networks at homes were hacked while students were attending their online classes. The cops shared with the audience the experience of a student, who had befriended a fraudster on Facebook and WhatsApp. “The accused had started stalking the student on her way to tuition classes or local market. The accused had claimed that he hailed from Bengaluru. Later, we found he worked at a local garage,” said a police officer, adding that they have also received complaints from the victims, who had lost money as their children were playing online games and using payment gateways. Another officer said that a private bank employee had once ordered food from a fraudster, who posed as the manager of a top restaurant in the city, and lost his money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-go-live-with-alert-against-cyber-crimes/articleshow/86879503.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A daily light and sound show has also been planned. The West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), which has been entrusted with the job, floated an expression of interest on Friday to engage an agency for preparing a concept and design report and to install, test and commission the light and sound show arrangements. Officials said that Alipore Central Correctional Home was a pre-Independence era building which was set up and started functioning from 1906. It is a Unesco World Heritage Site and spread over an area of 15.2 acres. The compound has a ward building, jail building, press building, hospital and other building blocks. The state government had started shifting the correctional home to Baruipur from mid-2018. With the evacuation work now over, it has been decided that the Alipore jail premises will be developed as an Independence museum by Hidco. To attract visitors the authorities have planned a light and sound show for 30-40 minutes daily in the evening. It will showcase the history of this pre-Independence era building and how it has evolved for over 100 years before the state finally decided to shift the premises to Baruipur. Agencies interested in setting up the light and sound show will need to visit the site and take note of the conditions, location and surroundings for preparing the concept and design and submit its proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/alipore-jail-to-house-museum-on-independence-movement/articleshow/86879626.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Doctors said the boy had to be put on ECMO support after his lungs turned white by the infection. The infection was so bad that the boy had to spend 29 days in Medica Superspeciality Hospital. TOI on September 14 had reported on the rising number of viral pneumonia cases among children. The boy was admitted in another private hospital with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It was diagnosed as an viral pneumonia. But despite being on ventilation, his oxygen saturation kept declining and the boy was shifted to Medica where a team under ECMO specialist Arpan Chakraborty and critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee took up the case. “Almost 99% of ECMO treatment since 2020 has been adult Covid patients. Prior to this case, we have had few ECMO cases in paediatric patients but for cardiac issues. This is one of those are very rare cases of viral pneumonia in children for which ECMO support was required,” said Chakraborty. Even as the boy could be taken off ECMO after 13 days, he had to put on ventilation support for the next three days. The doctors are happy that they could send the boy back home before the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kid-returns-home-after-29-days-in-hosp-13-on-ecmo/articleshow/86879630.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Pune||Monsoon misses exit dates in Pune, Mum||Pune: Monsoon has missed its usual exit dates from Pune and Mumbai because of the ongoing rainfall activity as well as the showers expected in the coming days. The usual date for monsoon to begin withdrawal from the extreme northern parts of Maharashtra, including areas of Palghar, is around October 5, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) states. The usual dates for monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai and Pune are around October 8 and 9, respectively. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD-Pune, told TOI that monsoon was yet to withdraw from major parts of India, though the withdrawal had started from the northwest part of the country. “Withdrawal for Pune and Mumbai could be almost a week away as per indications from the latest numerical weather prediction models and extended range forecast. The usual date of monsoon withdrawal commencement from extreme north Maharashtra was October 5. Withdrawal commencement from the region is also expected to be delayed by about a week,” he said. “We expect that monsoon withdrawal from parts of extreme Northeast Maharashtra, including areas of Vidarbha and north of Marathwada, is likely to happen around October 12. By October 14 or 15, monsoon may have withdrawn from more than 50% of the state,” Kashyapi said. The delay in monsoon withdrawal in Maharashtra is not only because of a delay in its commencement from northwest India but also because of the ongoing rainfall in several parts of Maharashtra, coupled with thundery activity and lightning. Kashyapi said, “No strong system is currently present adjacent to Maharashtra to influence the rains. However, there is significant moisture incursion into the state, which will help trigger the rains next few days. We have forecast fairly widespread rain in Konkan and Goa during the next 24 hours. We also expect rainfall activity to increase in this region from October 10 till October 12. A bulk of this rain will be convective in nature. We have also forecast thunder activity and lightning, along with isolated heavy rain, in the region.” Madhya Maharashtra is likely to get fairly widespread rain from October 8 till October 11. Heavy rain at isolated places during the next 96 hours is also likely for this region, especially the ghat areas of Nashik, Pune and Ahmednagar. Rainfall may reduce to scattered rain on October 12 in Madhya Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-misses-exit-dates-in-pune-mum/articleshow/86879411.cms||Neha Madaan

The girl said continuation of pregnancy would adversely affect her mental health. A JJ Hospital panel said the foetus had no abnormality and she did not have a medical or pregnancy-related disease. “The mother has moderate depressive episodes, and with treatment continuation of pregnancy is unlikely to affect her mental health. The mental condition the patient suffers from does not fulfil criteria of substantial risk of causing grave mental injury to the mother, and hence does not warrant medical termination of pregnancy.” The girl’s advocate, Shriram Kulkarni, said the medical board ignored her psychological condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-allows-mtp-for-26-wk-pregnant-18-yr-old-girl/articleshow/86879716.cms||Rosy Sequeira

India have embarked on an exposure tour to UAE and Bahrain with Spain and Jordan next stops on the list. An ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury during her stint with Rangers FC in Scotland means Bala is missing all the action, but the country’s biggest name in women’s football remains keen to claw her way back. “This is a big tournament for women’s football and I definitely want to be a part,” Bala told TOI over the phone from Bengaluru where she is undergoing rehab. “I’ve never had an ACL before and been away from football for so long. Hopefully, I’ll be back soon.” India will host the Asian Cup from January 20 to February 6, 2022. Apart from the injury, India’s most experienced striker tested positive for Covid-19 too, so her surgery had to be kept on hold for three months. Bala, 31, was finally operated on September 3 in Kolkata. While full recoveries can take anywhere between four to seven months, India’s first women footballer to sign a professional contract in Europe – and score -- is keeping her fingers crossed. “I don’t want to rush and get sidelined again, but I’ll do whatever I can to get ready. Two weeks after the surgery when I met the doctor and we did some exercises, I felt no pain. He checked (muscle strength) and said I could play in three to four months,” said Bala, who is scheduled to be in playing condition early January. Between 2010 and December 9, 2019, when she last represented the country, Bala scored 52 goals in 58 matches. She scored both goals in India’s 2-0 win over Nepal in the South Asian Games final, her last international assignment. Her role, if any, at the Asian Cup to be played at home will depend on coach Thomas Dennerby. “For her it will be really tough to be ready for the Asian Cup,” the Swedish coach had told reporters last month. The India striker is contracted with Rangers till December and is unlikely to continue since her visa has now expired. She will, however, extend her stay abroad with clubs in Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Australia all showing interest. For now, though, the focus is on recovery. After a month in Kolkata, Bala will be at the Inspire Institute of Sport, a high-performance training centre for top athletes in Bellary, till the end of the year. Where she goes from Bellary remains to be seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bala-keen-on-asian-cup-but-wont-rush-comeback/articleshow/86901098.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Their efforts began after CM Uddhav Thackeray tweeted last month that theatres and auditoriums would open after October 22. Once the zoo re-opens, the people can expect a few new attractions. Top of the list is first glimpses of the two new additions to the colony of Humboldt penguins. Also, not many have been able to meet the Royal Bengal tigers Shakti and Karishma that were brought from Siddharth Garden and Zoo in Aurangabad city in February 2020, just before the country went under a nationwide lockdown. The zoo had opened on February 15, 2021, after the first wave but shut in no time owing to concerns over the second Covid wave. A senior zoo official said talks with the senior administration are on and a decision on re-opening will be taken soon. “We have been getting enquiries on when the zoo would open. With theatres likely to open after October 22, a decision on the zoo will be taken soon,” said the official, adding that Covid-appropriate precautions like staggered entry will be taken. Zoo officials said the sex of the youngest penguin born in August is yet to be determined. It can be done only once the bird leaves the nest, where its parents are still feeding it. As the sex is yet to be determined, the chick hasn’t been named yet. The penguin born on May 1 this year has been named Oreo. Apart from the two newborns, there are seven other birds — Olive (7 years), Popeye (6), Donald (5.5), Daisy (5.5), Molt (5), Flipper (8) and Bubble (5).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-zoo-may-re-open-after-oct-22-baby-penguins-top-attraction/articleshow/86879608.cms||Richa Pinto

Given the massive Rs 1- lakh-crore financial albatross around its neck, not getting even a single bidder in 2018 came as no surprise to them. Their worst fear was ending up like Alitalia that had to be shut because Italy did not privatise it in time. And the best hope: a turnaround like Lufthansa, KLM, Swiss or British Airways when they transited from government to private ownership. Now as the airline heads for a homecoming to founder Tata Group, there are two distinct sets of employees. One sees a bright future for AI and themselves. And others who cite the recurring losses of AirAsia India and Vistara since launch, and wonder whether the group has so far been any different from the government in running airlines profitably during re-entry into the business less than a decade back. “Successive governments did a terrible job of running, or great job of ruining, AI and Indian Airlines. The two airlines simply could not take on competition as they were run by political masters and clueless managements with a few honourable exceptions. Now there is a ray of hope that Tatas will eventually put in place a team of best domain specialists drawn from a global talent pool and ensure AI gets its rightful place under the sun,” said a senior pilot.

After a marathon disinvestment process, which was reinitiated in January last year, the government on Friday announced that TataWhile not differing with this pilot over suffering decades of mismanagement as a PSU, a longtime employee said: “This is a case of a loss-making entity (Tata JV airlines) taking over another another mega loss-making entity (AI). If government let clueless bureaucrats run AI, Tata is yet to boast of a crack aviation team of the kind that Rahul Bhatia has built at IndiGo due to which full service Qatar Airways has for years been requesting a stake in the budget airline,” said the staffer. Every set of employees has its own anxieties. Cabin crew, for instance, remains worried if the not-so-young ones will be retained for too long in the privatised AI. To be sure, most foreign airlines have a mix of youth and experience (read not so young) cabin crew members.

The local authorities should take proactive steps because there is a need to curtail the cases in that specific area and prevent further spread,” said the state task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit. Ahmednagar collector RB Bhosale recently identified 110 villages recording a rise in cases. He issued lockdown orders in 69 villages in the district. Pandit said the cases in the state had plateaued over the last two months but the daily figures continued to be in four digits, which should have been ideally in three digits like in other states. “We have intensified vaccination and hoping that the cases of hospitalisation go down and the criticality of patients reduces,” he said. He stressed on keeping the Covid case count under check while the state was going through the unlocking process to help the economy. Besides, he said, there was a need to ensure that the weekly positivity rate (WPR) was under control. The state’s WPR declined to 2.07% from the last week’s 2.11%, according to the cabinet note. A total of 10 districts recorded higher WPR than the state average but none surpassed the crucial 5%-mark. An official of the public health department officials said the Covid case count in the top five districts among the 10 recording higher WPR than that of the state was less compared to last the week. It was a good sign, he said. “It is essential for each of these districts to keep a close watch for any rise in cases in any clusters and go for ring fencing,” said the state’s surveillance expert, Dr Pradip Awate. He said there were several opinions on the possibility of third wave. Residents would have to follow the Covid protocols strictly and the state had increased vaccination so that the current unlocking process could be carried out to boost the economy, he said. These were also the tools to tackle the possible third wave, Awate added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-advises-districts-to-follow-ring-fencing-method/articleshow/86879640.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He was told that the monthly pension of 86% of the applicants had been started. On October 1, the chief minister was miffed with the officials concerned over the delay in processing the applications and directed them to disburse the aid at the earliest. Since then, 14,605 applications for the one-time assistance have been verified online and by visiting homes, and 13,005 families have got Rs 50,000 each in their bank accounts. Officials said 2,196 families had voluntarily withdrawn since the launch of the scheme in July. The work to provide the monthly pension is also going on rapidly, but some applicants haven’t been able to register online, they added. Kejriwal had asked the officials concerned to “do whatever it takes, make the process simpler and more accessible”. The families of the people who have died due to Covid at home can either apply on the portal or get themselves registered when government officials visit them. As the one-time financial assistance, Rs 50,000 is being given to the family of every person who has died due to the novel coronavirus infection. Under the monthly pension plan, Rs 2,500 is being given to households that have lost their sole breadwinner and to each orphan child till the age of 25. The Delhi government will look after the orphan children whose both parents have died due to Covid-19, or one of the parents had died earlier and the other one now in the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-assistance-reaches-89-of-eligible-families/articleshow/86879346.cms||AlokKNMishra

The police said he has so far committed over 205 thefts so far. The accused, Salim Habib Qureshi alias Munna, who is from Bengaluru was arrested on October 2 by officials of Powai police station on a tip-off they had received. Earlier two of his accomplices — Gaus Shaikh (36) from Hyderabad and Taufiq Qureshi (31) from Govandi — had been arrested on September 30 for allegedly stealing gold ornaments and foreign currency worth Rs 24.71 lakh from a Powai resident’s flat at Hiranandani Complex on September 18. Investigators learnt that the kingpin, Salim, has committed such offences at the houses of many high-profile personalities, politicians in Madhya Pradesh and even at the house of gangster Chhota Rajan in 2001. The trio was wanted for the break-ins they executed in the house of Niranjan Kardenvis on the 13th floor at Jal Vayu Vihar residential complex on the night of September 18. “Salim has committed 25 break-ins in Mumbai, 102 in Pune, 65 in Telangana, 15 in Hyderabad, four in Surat-Rajkot, three Nashik and one in Jaipur. He travels to and from different cities by flight,” DCP Maheshwar Reddy told TOI. Salim is a Mumbai resident but got settled in Hyderabad and later Bengaluru after marrying three women. The accused was identified with the help of CCTV footage. “He hired a car to get entry into the residential building, posing as a visitor and managed to fool the security guard. He and his accomplices had kept watch on the building and noticed that the lights at Kardenvis’s flat were switched off for the last few days,” said senior inspector AK Sonawane. The break-in was executed after Kardenvis and his wife were on tour to Meghalaya. After committing a theft at any place, Salim used to travel to variouos states to escape from getting caught. DCP Reddy formed a team comprising senior inspector A K Sonawane, inspector Srikrishna Hargude, assistant inspector Vinod Patil, sub-inspectors Vinod Lad and Yash Palwe who jointly tracked Salim with technical help and managed to recover Rs21.6 lakh of the booty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/frequent-flyer-whod-stolen-at-gangsters-home-nabbed/articleshow/86879677.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: After 43 days in critical care, suicide-bid protester goes home from hospital before Puja||KOLKATA: A contractual teacher who was fighting for life after taking poison during a protest in August has been discharged from the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital (RGKMCH). Putul Jana Mandal was sent home ahead of Durga Puja after 43 days of being under critical care. The 59-year-old teacher from Bakkhali was among four who had taken poison on August 24 during a protest. While the other three were treated at NRS Medical College, Jana Mandal was shifted to RG Kar as her condition was the most critical. She had been in RG Kar’s cricital care unit (CCU) on invasive ventilation from the first day. “The patient had taken a poisonous compound that had a mix of organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid. It was a pesticide. Due to the huge amount she had consumed, it had resulted into her developing intermediate syndrome that caused weakness in respiratory muscles,” said forensic medicine head Somnath Das. Doctors said OP is an easily available poison and is the most common poisoning reason they get in the hospital. But as it is not lethal in moderate quantities, they can treat patients with procedures with stomach washing and other conservative treatment. “But in this case, the patient had all the possible complications of poisoning, making it one of a kind. We are happy that a multidisciplinary team successfully treated and sent her home,” said medicine head Aniruddha Ray. Considering her critical condition, the hospital got a multidisciplinary team to treat her. “A section of organophosphorus poisoned patients develop a distinct neurologic disorder after 24 to 96 hours of exposure to the poison. This disorder consists of characteristic neurological findings, including neck flexion weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes, cranial nerve abnormalities, proximal muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency. This is called intermediate syndrome,” said critical care medicine professor Sugata Dasgupta, who heads the CCU. Though she was taken off invasive ventilation after 10 days, Jana Mandal had to be on non-invasive ventilation for weeks. After being brought out of ventilation, she was given rehabilitation therapy to allow her to begin walking. “The service and dedication we got at RG Kar was very good,” said a family member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-43-days-in-critical-care-suicide-bid-protester-goes-home-from-hosp-before-puja/articleshow/86879629.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Pune||States to decide on home-based Covid-19 testing kits||PUNE: With the Centre having told all states to ramp up testing, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which has approved three home-based test kits, has left it upon states to take a call on them. While these kits are being used, many states have continuously been stressing on RT-PCR and antigen tests ahead of the festive season. Last year, the Centre had pushed for home-based test kits to decrease the load on laboratories. Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, said that even as the apex research institute has approved three home-based test kits, it is up to the states to decide on them. “As of now, we have approved three kits and we are not in a hurry to approve more,” he told TOI. Currently, the ICMR has approved Coviself from Mylab Discovery solutions, Panbio from Abbott Rapid Diagnostics divison, and Covidfind from Meril Diagnostics. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state has always been focussing on RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests in areas where there are no facilities for RT-PCR tests. “Home-based self-test kits were never our focus,” he said. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said that the percentage of use of home-based test kits was anyway less. Mylab Discovery solutions spokesperson said that it was expecting a rise in demand for self-test kits because of the upcoming festivals and rise in flu cases. A Karnataka government task force member said that the state has been mostly insisting on RT-PCR tests. The Kerala government recently stopped antigen tests for Covid-19 in private labs. Dr Santosh Kumar, deputy superintendent, Trivandrum Medical College Kerala, said, “With increasing cases, the state has focussed more on RT-PCR tests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-to-decide-on-home-based-testing-kits/articleshow/86879571.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Thane's Covid positivity rate jumps, low and steady in Mumbai||MUMBAI: For the fourth time in the last 10 days, the city’s daily Covid case count was above 500, with 529 cases registered on Friday. The daily count was below 400 only on October 4 (339) in this period. Maharashtra (2,620) continued to add fewer than 3,000 cases for the seventh day, and recorded 59 deaths, taking the total caseload to 65.7 lakh and the total toll to 1,39,490. BMC health officials said there is an uptick in cases, but it is not alarming. “In certain pockets such as Malabar Hill, the daily cases have increased from 15 a day previously to 30,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “There is free movement, socialisation and overcrowding. Also, the number of people coming into the city has gone up in recent weeks. These are reasons that are leading to a spurt,” he said. However, the daily positivity rate in the city continues to be around 1.2% and the weekly growth rate in some wards has fallen from 0.1% to 0.09%. However, the weekly average Covid positivity rate in Thane city has shot up to 3.2%, a steep rise from 1.9%, after the Ganpati festival. Even as experts attributed the rise to mingling among people, crowding during the festive season along with lax adherence to Covid safety protocol, the Thane Municipal Corporation claimed there is nothing to worry at this stage. State government officials said a slight increase or decrease in cases is not a cause for worry and it is linked to the number of tests carried out. The number of people getting admitted to hospital in critical condition has not gone up. “Although we have to watch out for the numbers, a slight increase is not worrisome. Maharashtra has been showing a consistent declining trend despite opening up of most sectors,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/thane-vity-rate-jumps-low-and-steady-in-city/articleshow/86879560.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp takes steps to resolve tax payment issues||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation will organise a month long tax adalat to address issues regarding property tax payment in the city following allegations of fund fraud in zonal offices. While addressing the special council meeting held here on Thursday, Mayor Arya Rajendran said the data updation of 4.5 lakh tax assessments will be completed within a month following which adalats will be held. The adalats will be held from November 22 to December 17 covering all zonal offices and main office. The adalats will be held on four days for the main office. The mayor said after the data updation and the adalats, all the complaints regarding tax payment will be resolved. Earlier BJP parliamentary party leader M R Gopan cited his own example to highlight the lapses in data updation. He said his payment of around Rs 20,000 as tax was yet to be reflected on the website. The mayor responded to his statement and said as soon as the complaint was received, the updation was completed. Gopan, however, said the mayor was setting a wrong precedent by expecting all those with complaints to turn up in the office so that discrepancies in tax payment could be resolved. The special council meeting saw fiery exchanges between both the fronts on numerous occasions. The mayor nearly lost her cool more than once as Gopan tried to rattle her with statements like the corporation was not cooperating with police in furnishing the relevant evidence to press charges against the accused staff. She kept on disrupting Gopan and said she could not let him mislead the council and if he continued to do so she would be forced to say that he was cheating the public. The UDF also picked up from where Gopan left and targeted her. UDF parliamentary party leader Padmakumar said the CPM leadership should not restrain mayor and should let her act freely without undue interests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-takes-steps-to-resolve-tax-payment-issues/articleshow/86849863.cms||---

While Teni’s counsel said “no case” against him is pending, the verdict in the murder case has not been pronounced by the Allahabad high court since 2018. On July 8, 2000, Teni was booked for murder at Tikunia police station. Local police said a “history sheet” had been maintained against him but it was quashed later. In 2004, the district and sessions court in Kheri acquitted Teni in the murder of local businessman Prabhat Gupta.  His family then moved the high court. In 2018, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court reserved its judgment. When it didn’t pronounce the verdict after nine months, the case was transferred to another bench. The second bench has still not given its verdict. Teni was accused of killing Gupta, in a busy market. “He never went to jail,” Teni’s lawyer Avdhesh Kumar Singh told TOI. He is the one who had secured his bail then. “Many people had signed affidavits saying Teni was not present at the spot of Gupta’s death.” As the case went on, the rivalry grew more intense — Gupta's brother Rajeev, his brother Sanjeev and their father were accused of trying to kill Teni on court premises during trial in 2003. Sanjeev was convicted and the two others acquitted. “There is no case pending against my client. He has either been acquitted by court or the cases have been withdrawn by the state government,” Singh said.  In his 2019 affidavit for the election to the Kheri Lok Sabha seat, Teni did mention the murder charge and the “pending” appeal against acquittal. “I was 24 then. I am 45 now. We are waiting for the verdict. It has been years. We had given up. But with the focus on the Kheri case, we hope ours will be in the spotlight soon," said Rajeev.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-in-spotlight-local-family-talks-of-pending-plea-against-teni-in-hc/articleshow/86879539.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

This is the fresh chargesheet in the second case of pornography registered by Mumbai Police. There are four cases of pornography crime branch is probing and another case is being probed by Lonavla police. In the 500-page chargesheet, the police have charged Vashist, film producers Abhijit Bomble, Baburao Pralhad alias Ajay Shrimant, Prince Kumar alias Kashyap and Arvindkumar Srivastav alias Yash Thakur. Police said Bomble and Shrimant have been arrested while Vashist has got interim relief from Supreme Court while Prince Kumar Kashyap and Yash Thakur have been shown as ‘absconding accused’. They have been charged under the IPC sections involving sale of obscene books, obscene act, outraging modesty of woman, cheating and under sections of the Information Technology Act. Last month, the police had filed supplementary chargesheet in the first case of pornography in which they had arrested Raj Kundra and his company’s IT head Ryan Thorpe in connection with production and distribution of pornographic content on his mobile apps. The fresh chargesheet pertains to a complaint filed by a 21-year old aspiring model from Madhya Pradesh who lodged a complaint that under pretext of giving her a break in the short movies, Bomble, then Ajay Shrimant, Gehana Vashist and later Prince Kashyap took her to three bungalows — two at Madh Island and one in Lonavla — on multiple occasions and forced her to act in porn movies and those clips were uploaded in three apps. She said she was paid Rs 10,000 to 15,000 per shoot. When she refused to act, the accused promised that the obscene videos would be edited but they were uploaded without any cut. After the crime branch in February arrested a gang of five including Rowa Yasmin Khan shooting a live porn film at a Madh Island bungalow, they made an appeal to victims to come forward and lodge a complaint, she gathered courage to lodge the complaint. She said Vashist forced her to sign agreements by luring a major role in films. Vashist had been arrested in the pornography racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/model-forced-strugglers-into-porn-films-new-chargesheet/articleshow/86879513.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||Oppn playing dirty politics over Chhath, says Kejriwal||New Delhi: Hitting out at the Opposition over their demand of permitting Chhath Puja in public places, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said dirty politics was being played over the issue. The retort comes in the wake of BJP MP Manoj Tiwari planning a “Chhath Yatra” from Sonia Vihar in his North East Delhi constituency from Saturday to mobilise people from the Poorvanchali community.Chhath will be celebrated from November 8 to 11. “Even AAP MLAs want Chhath to be celebrated in public places. Chhath is associated with the sentiments of Poorvanchali people and all political parties should demand revoking of the ban,” said Tiwari. Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri wrote to Kejriwal urging him to submit a proposal to DDMA to permit Chhath Puja in public places. Kejriwal, while interacting with mediapersons in central Delhi, said the Opposition was doing dirty politics over the issue. “We want people to celebrate all festivals. During Chhath Puja, devotees wade into the water. If one person with Covid-19 enters, the entire water will get infected, which will lead to the virus spreading quickly. We banned the puja keeping the health of people in mind,” he added. Bidhuri, whose Badarpur assembly constituency has a sizable number of Poorvanchali voters, said the government could impose strict conditions, but it must lift the ban. “Chhath is just a month away. The government should give permission immediately so that the cleaning of riverbeds, ponds, etc can be started. As the Covid-19 situation is under control, it will be safe to allow celebrations in public,” added Bidhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oppn-playing-dirty-politics-over-chhath-says-kejriwal/articleshow/86879088.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A fortnight-long Urs — to be held with Covid protocols in place — will conclude on October 21. The Piran Kaliyar shrine has a prominent seat of Sufism as a shrine of Sabir Baba. Every year, an Urs (a death anniversary event) is conducted with pilgrims from all over the country and even from across borders. The event is held in accordance with the lunar calendar at the shrine of Sabir Baba, a 13th century Sufi saint of Chishtiya order. However, the Urs could not be organised last year due to the Covid pandemic. "This year, Urs is being held with Covid protocols. It will be observed without the usual grandeur. Besides, no foreign pilgrims will join the Urs this year," said Urs organising secretary Afzal Manglori. The main rituals of the Urs will fall on October 18 (Chhoti Roshni), October 19 (Badi Roshni), October 20 (Qul Sharif), and October 21 (Gusal Sharif/completion of the Urs). Meanwhile, Gulshad Siddiqui, head of a social organisation, Anjuman Gulaname Mustafa, said, “The government arranges Char Dham Yatra but the Piran Kaliyar Urs is conducted at the expense of the shrine. To keep the public attraction towards the Urs intact, the government must allocate funds for the Urs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amid-covid-protocols-annual-urs-at-piran-kaliyar-shrine-begins/articleshow/86879420.cms||Tapan Susheel

One of the ideas the expert panel is considering is gabion wall technology. This refers to retaining walls made by stacking baskets of rocks tied together with wire. This technology “will be least intrusive to the natural environment of the lake,” the BMC said in a statement, adding, “Gabion wall technology, an eco-friendly and worldwide accepted methodology in natural environments, is a simple method of placing stone baskets without any permanent construction or joinery or fixing or cement mortar.” On the panel are environmental scientist Dr Rakesh Kumar from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), marine biologist Dr Deepak Apte from BNHS, environment specialist on Powai lake Dr Pramod Salaskar, herpetologist Dr Kedar Bhide, and IIT Bombay’s Professor DN Singh. “The committee will also monitor water quality throughout the project and will make key recommendations on the current and future sustainability of biodiversity and natural habitats of the lake environment,” the BMC said. After days of protests by citizens, as well as objections raised by BJP MP Manoj Kotak, the civic body doubled down on its stance that no rules were being violated, as Powai lake is not a notified wetland, and the track is not a construction project but merely landscape and site development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-forms-expert-panel-to-study-impact-of-powai-lake-cycling-track/articleshow/86879706.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

On Wednesday evening, a bus driver was assaulted by two men, travelling in a car, near the BRTS corridor on the Pune-Satara Road. Officials said with a fresh proposal sent to PMC and PCMC authorities on setting up boom barriers in the BRTS corridors, hiring of guards is not being considered. “Both the civic bodies have been asked to look into the boom barrier project and approve it. There were around 150 marshals guarding the BRTS corridors before the pandemic. They had to be removed once the pandemic hit, and they have not been recruited again,” a PMPML official said. “The Wednesday’s incident is being investigated, and we will speak to the driver and conductor in detail. They should have immediately reported the incident to us, but they chose to wait till their duty ended and then approached the cops,” PMPML traffic manager Dattatray Zende told TOI. “There is no one to guard the corridors and the PMPML is harping on a project which is yet to receiving approvals. It shows the seriousness of the PMPML and the corporations towards the multi-crore BRTS project,” PMP Pravasi Manch secretary Sanjay Shitole, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rule-violators-have-a-field-day-as-brts-lanes-remain-without-security-guards/articleshow/86879161.cms||Joy Sengupta

Dr Vyas is confident the turnout will rise in days to come, especially on Saturday when the state previously registered its highest turnout of 15+lakh. “On Friday, the number of people who took the first shot crossed the six-crore mark,” he said. In Maharashtra, 65% of the adult population has got one dose, while nearly 30% are fully vaccinated. On the flipside, nearly 3 crore are yet to receive a single dose. There are 21 districts with vaccination rates below the state's average. Washim district officer Dr Avinash Aaher said Friday’s response was ‘below average’ as the fear of the second wave has ebbed. In Washim, 51% of the adult population has received the first dose. The peak harvest time of soyabean, the main crop in the district, is another factor. “Our teams have been going door-to-door in the villages, but people say they will come after Dusshera when the peak harvest time is behind us,” said Aaher. The district is now targeting youth and women who do not have farm work. Another official said the Kawach Kundal Mission was launched too quickly without time for district officials to prepare, both in terms of logistics and awareness drives. Satara health officer Dr Radhakrishna Pawar said the festival season is keeping crowds away from vaccine centres. “Many women fast during the Navratri festival and they fear side-effects such as weakness and fever,” said Pawar. He said they have devised a multipronged strategy for the coming weeks. "We have enough doses available, we plan to have mobile vans in villages where the number of beneficiaries are less and in the city we have plans to conduct non-stop sessions for over 75 hours from October 10,"said Pawar. The problem of last mile coverage is visible in Mumbai, where 93% of the eligible population have already got their first dose and 50% are fully vaccinated. “We have decided to go to the community to boost coverage,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC public health department will now carry out vaccination within communities. “We will choose a spot close to many housing colonies and offer vaccination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-campaign-to-target-15l-daily-gets-off-to-a-slow-start/articleshow/86879544.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Goa||SAFF Cup: India face Nepal in must-win clash||India are in danger of getting knocked out of the SAFF Championship if they do not win against Nepal at the National Stadium in Male on Sunday. India have made it to every final since 2005 and won seven of the 12 editions so far. This year, though, the highest-ranked team has struggled with dull draws in their first two games. “Nothing has changed, it’s still open,” coach Igor Stimac said at the pre-match media interaction on Saturday. “We are here. We are still alive in the championship. We are still here to win the tournament.” India are fourth with two points, but a win will take them up to second on the table. The top two teams qualify for the final. Sitting pretty at the top are Nepal with six points from two wins against Maldives (1-0) and Sri Lanka (3-2). Another win will guarantee them a place in the final. “Nepal may have a different approach. They may calculate while playing against us. But we are not worried about them. We will go out to do our job from the first minute itself,” said Stimac. The two teams played two back-to-back international friendlies in Kathmandu last month. Having drawn the first, India won the second match 2-1. India have been found wanting and look far from the team that is ranked 107, much ahead of Maldives (158), Nepal (168), Bangladesh (189) and Sri Lanka (205). Against Bangladesh, India allowed their opponents to steal a point after enjoying a numerical advantage for almost the entire second half, while Sri Lanka frustrated them for a goalless draw. “We have had two disappointing results so far,” said midfielder Brandon Fernandes. “The mood was dull in the camp, but we now have everything to fight for. We are positive, and have prepared well for this game. Everyone is focussed on winning.” In a must-win game, Stimac could make changes to his starting 11 with Brandon, Lalengmawia Ralte, Mohammed Yasir and Pritam Kotal all expected to get the nod. “It’s an open game and if we play well, and do it right on the pitch, I am sure we can win the game,” said Stimac. The problem for India is that they have done little right on the field so far. Should they get it wrong against Nepal, it will be all over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saff-cup-india-face-nepal-in-must-win-clash/articleshow/86901235.cms||---

The delay has forced many bajra farmers to sell their produce to private parties, which offer much lower rates than the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. Farmers under the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) have decided to hold a panchayat at Kosli subdivision of Rewari on October 10 over the delay in procuring bajra. Apart from the buying of crops, the farmers would also discuss the three central laws, contentious statements given by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The state government was supposed to start procuring bajra from October 1 at an MSP of Rs 2,250 per quintal. On September 28, it had also announced the inclusion of bajra under the Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana. Under the scheme, farmers would be given an additional Rs 600 on every quintal of the produce they have to sell at the market price and not the MSP. Farmers in Haryana can sell only 25% of their produce at MSP this year. The rest can be sold at the average market price. Raj Kumar of Nimoth village has been bringing his produce to the mandi every day since September 30. He has been forced to sell some of it to private buyers. “Selling to private buyers means losses. These private parties know our situation, which is why they are not increasing their rates too. If the government does not respond, we have no option. We just can’t let the produce rot like this,” said Kumar. Some farmers pointed out that even if the government gave an additional Rs 600 to those selling their produce at the market rate, it would still mean losses for them. The MSP for procuring bajra in Rewari is Rs 2,250 per quintal. The average mandi price is between Rs 1,250 and 1,350. Even if the government gives an additional Rs 600 on every quintal, the farmers would still run losses of Rs 300-400. “The government said it would procure only 25% of the bajra this time. But there is no clarity on when the procurement will begin,” said Satya Prakash, the market committee secretary. Rewari has 41,000 bajra growers. Last year, Rewari had produced about 6 lakh quintals of bajras. This year, it is expected to produce at least 3 lakh quintals. “This government is slowly paving the way for private players into the mandis by stopping the MSP for bajra growers,” said Samay Kumar, a farmer. In a letter, farmers outfit Jai Kisan Andolan has written to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, seeking increase in compensation announced by the government under Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana. “The new Bhavantar Yojana is going to cause a loss between Rs 289 crore and Rs 637 crore to the bajra farmers in the state. This will be compensated only if the amount given by the government is increased from Rs 600 per quintal to Rs 1,000 per quintal,” the letter reads. Rewari DC Yashendra Singh could not be contacted despite repeated calls. Haryana agriculture secretary Sumita Misra refused to comment on the issue, when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bajra-procurement-delayed-farmers-to-hold-panchayat/articleshow/86822080.cms||Sagrika Kissu

Prof Ram Meghe College of Engineering principal Mir Saddique Ali had challenged the notice of superannuation whereby the management — Vidarbha Youth Welfare Society — declared him retired at the age of 62 years, which was in violation of the guidelines from the All India Council for Technical Education where the retiring age is specified at 65 years. Ali approached the ‘University and College Tribunal’ through counsel Akshay Sudame by filing a case against the management. The tribunal, after hearing his contentions, granted a stay to the college action. However, the presiding officer there retired on September 16, thus leading to an increase in the pendency of cases. The petitioner then knocked the high court’s doors seeking extension of stay granted by the tribunal and also sought directives for appointment of presiding officer. Rajeev Bhuibar appeared for the management society while government pleader Ketki Joshi held the brief for the state. Ali pointed out that the tribunal being a statutory authority hearing important cases cannot be kept vacant at any time. He brought to fore that in the past the tribunal has been vacant for almost one year between the appointments. Therefore, access to statutory remedy under Section 81 of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act is rendered redundant, he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fill-up-presiding-officers-vacancy-in-tribunal-hc/articleshow/86879294.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Petrol in Kol crosses Rs 104; diesel less than Rs 5 short of century||Kolkata: Petrol price in the city crossed the Rs 104-mark on Friday, three months after it had crossed Rs 100. It has been on an upward rise over the last two weeks with price revisions being done eight times in twelve days. Diesel price has also increased significantly and now stands at Rs 95.19, less than Rs 5 short of a century amidst volatility in the global oil prices. In Kolkata, petrol price had hit the century run across all petrol pumps on July 7 as it clocked Rs 100.29 per litre. It had a steady run for the next 11 days to reach Rs 102.14 and the price remained there till August 21 following which it started dropping and came down to Rs 101.64 on September 7. The price remained constant at this mark for the next 20 days after which the rise started again and it has now crossed Rs 104. “Once the price has crossed Rs 100, these minor changes don’t affect anymore. I had never felt any relief because of the one-rupee price fall but now that the price has started to increase steadily again, I wonder if it will cross the Rs 120-mark by the end of this year. That will certainly hurt us,” said Subhadeep Mitra, who has started riding his bike more often these days keeping his car in the garage to save on fuel cost. Fuel prices in the country have been hovering at record levels on account of 41 increases in its retail rates since April this year. It fell on a few occasions but largely remained stable. Petrol prices had maintained stability between September 6 and September 27 but oil companies finally raised its pump prices last week given a spurt in the product prices lately. Petrol prices have also risen on six of the previous eight days. OMCs had preferred to maintain their watch on global oil situations before making any revision in prices. This is the reason why petrol prices were not revised for the last three weeks. But extreme volatility in global oil price movement has now pushed OMCs to effect the increase. Benchmark Brent crude oil is trading at over $82 per barrel. When the price had crossed Rs 100, the Brent crude was selling at $76.20 per barrel and at the start of the year it was about $51.80 per barrel. Sources at an oil PSU suggested the price of crude oil can rise further up to $90 per barrel by December which will certainly lead to further increase in fuel prices in Kolkata as well as the rest of the country. Petrol pump owners’ association has demanded the Centre and state to reduce taxes that constitute over 55% of total price paid for a litre of petrol. “There has been a steady fall in oil consumption by motorists after the constant price rise. Considering a zero tax situation, we can sell petrol at Rs 44 per litre. The Centre and state should seriously consider reducing the tax components else our country will head towards an overall rise in inflation,” said Snehasish Bhowmik, vice president, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-in-kol-crosses-rs-104-diesel-less-than-rs-5-short-of-century/articleshow/86879634.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Police suspect the role of an unidentified woman who pretended to help the baby’s mother in the episode. Police identified the baby’s parents as Gunasekaran, 24, a resident of Burma Colony in Thanjavur, a construction worker and his wife G Rajalakshmi, 22. Rajalakshmi, who was nine months pregnant, was admitted to the Government Raja Mirasdar Hospital on October 5 and gave birth to a girl the same day. A woman, who was not acquainted with Rajalakshmi approached her and voluntarily started to help her. She was also taking care of the baby for the last three days. On Friday morning, the unidentified woman told Rajalakshmi to go and take bath while she would take care of the baby. Believing her, Rajalakshmi went to take a bath. When she returned, she found the baby and the woman missing. Shocked, she searched for the baby and the woman, but could not find them. Her husband who rushed to the hospital along with his relatives, also searched the entire hospital. Since they could not find the baby, he lodged a complaint with the Thanjavur west police. Thanjavur DySP Kabilan and his team conducted an investigation. CCTV footage from surveillance cameras in the hospital showed that the suspect woman was found going out from the ward carrying a big shopper bag. Police have launched a search for the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/four-day-old-baby-goes-missing-from-govt-hospital-in-thanjavur/articleshow/86879492.cms||---

Srivastava, who retired on September 29 this year, had cited Justice VR Krishna Iyer’s iconic statement from four decades ago, “Who will police the police?”, while dismissing the bail plea of two police officers accused of conspiring in the Bikru ambush, in which gangster Vikas Dubey allegedly killed eight policemen. “There is a concerning trend that one or other political party welcomes gangsters and criminals involved in organized crime in the party and try to back and protect them … They are given tickets to contest elections and sometimes they win also. This trend needs to be stopped,” he had said in his order. “Political parties should rise above board against crime and corruption without being influenced by consideration of ‘his man’ and ‘our man’ as this approach will not only undermine rule of law but will also damage the democratic set up of the nation,” he had added. The police and the state had also come under the scanner in his judgment on a man detained under the stringent National Security Act (NSA). In December 2020, while ordering the release of a man initially accused of arson and rioting during clashes between dalits and Muslims at a village in Jaunpur, Srivastava said, “The history of personal liberty is largely the history of insistence on observation of the procedural safeguards.” About the use of NSA, he added, “Where the law confers extraordinary power on the executive to detain a person without recourse to the ordinary law of land and to trial by courts, such a law has to be strictly construed and the executive must exercise the power with extreme care.” Gender rights, too, came into focus in his judgments. He held marital rape as a crime in a May 2019 order, saying it was “an illegal intrusion in the privacy of the wife and amounts to cruelty against her.” And in August this year, he had said that the legislature should come up with a legal framework for cases where someone obtains consent for sex on the false promise of marriage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/trend-of-parties-welcoming-criminals-must-stop-retd-judge-leading-kheri-judicial-inquiry-had-said/articleshow/86879644.cms||---

This will strengthen the border security system and border domination will get better. Besides this, night fire capability of BSF jawans is being increased for which they are being imparted training. In his four-day visit to border areas, Rajasthan frontier IG Pankaj Goomer visited the deployment area of the new battalion at the international border adjoining Bikaner and Ganganagar and reviewed the entire situation and boosted the morale of jawans. BSF sector south DIG Anand Singh Takshak, Ganganagar sector DIG Amit Tyagi, sector north commandant Lokesh Kumar, 87 BSF officiating commandant A K Singh and other officers were present. IG Goomer inspected many border outposts including Gajjewala, RCwala, Raithanwala, Tanot, etc., at the international border adjoining Jaisalmer sector north and south and took stock of security arrangements on Friday. He directed jawans to take care of their health and have balanced food looking to change in the weather. He boosted the morale of the jawans and directed them to remain alert and conduct border domination with full alertness, especially during the night. Input has been received that a nexus between the present Taliban government in Afghanistan and Pakistan intelligence agency ISI is taking place. Due to threat of drones across the border and strict vigilance by BSF in Punjab border area, Pakistan smugglers are not able to smuggle heroin into India so they are making efforts to smuggle heroin from Bikaner and Ganganagar border. In this regard, the need for an additional battalion was being felt to further strengthen the security arrangement in this area. The BSF headquarters has approved a new battalion and its deployment has been done recently. Goomer visited the redeployment area of the new battalion especially at Himgiri, KK Tibba, Khadola, Sisada, Sakhi, etc., and boosted the morale of the jawans. The IG said that the technical surveillance grid is being further strengthened in the entire Rajasthan border. CCTV and other surveillance gadgets are being installed at the border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-battalion-of-bsf-deployed-on-intl-border/articleshow/86879181.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Last-minute push for Covid vaccination before Durga Puja||KOLKATA: The state health department is giving a last-minute push to the Covid vaccination programme before the drive loses pace during the Durga Puja. More than 24 lakh doses have been administered in the past three days. On Friday, close to 9 lakh doses were administered till reports came in last. The state wants to utilize about 32 lakh more doses in the next three days before Saptami. On Friday, Bengal crossed the 4.5 crore mark for the first dose. It has till now administered over 6.2 crore doses. The total eligible population in Bengal is around 7 crore. Bengal is expected to get 1.5 crore doses in October, of which 50 lakh doses have already arrived. Most parts of the state, especially Kolkata, were in a festive mood from Friday itself. Despite that, the health department activated close to 4,000 vaccination sites on Friday. Health officials said they will try to make the most of the next three days — Saturday, Sunday and Monday — before the drive slows down for five days of the festival. TimesViewThe push for vaccination is timely. A double-vaccinated public is better-protected than an unvaccinated population.“The government-run CVCs attached with government-run hospitals will continue to function even during Durga Puja, except on Ashtami. But it is likely that fewer people will turn up to take the vaccine. That is why we want to utilise most of vials we have in our hands before the festivity kicks off,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare office. Though all governmentrun vaccination sites will continue to operate during the festival except on Ashthami — barring the KMC-run clinics, which will be shut — health officials said due to the likely low turnout, the drive will lose pace. This is the reason they have been trying to activate maximum number of sites before the festival. On Friday morning, the state had about 42 lakh doses in its possession. TOI on October 6 had reported that the health officials were confident of covering at least 65% of the state’s eligible population with the first dose. More than 1.8 crore people in Bengal have already been vaccinated with both doses. On October 5, the state had achieved the 6 crore-dose milestone, taking 17 days to administer one crore doses. This month, over 50 lakh doses have already been dispensed in the first eight days. KMC vax clinics to be shut during Puja:The KMC has decided to shut its Covid vaccination clinics for four days from October 12 (Saptami). The KMC-run mega vaccination centres will also remain shut for four days, said Atin Ghosh, member of KMC Board of Administrators overseeing the health department, on Friday. “We will reopen our vaccination clinics and mega centres from October 16. Thereafter, they will render their services without a pause though our offices will remain closed for more than a fortnight,” Ghosh said. However, at least one urban primary health centre will be open in each of the 16 boroughs for rapid antigen or RT-PCR tests. “We have randomly chosen one ward in each borough, which will be operating during the four-day festival. Citizens can drop in and get rapid antigen test or RT-PCR test done,” Ghosh said. KMC will also keep all 15 dengue detection centres open during the Puja. Besides, the KMC will also offer malaria tests for those prescribed to take such a test from its health clinics in the wards, Ghosh said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/last-minute-push-for-vax-before-puja/articleshow/86879631.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors’ team checks Covid compliance at pandals||KOLKATA: A group of doctors fanned out across Puja pandals of Kolkata on Friday to inspect if the latter complied with Covid protocols and had Covid awareness initiatives and emergency medical facilities at the venues. The team members were pleasantly surprised to find all seven pandals they visited this year 1 all in the same zone — ready to implement Covid-control measures. “This Durga Puja being the second since the pandemic onset, most organizers seem to be aware of the Covid-19 protocols and kept those in mind while designing their pandals. We are satisfied with the kind of measures in place at the pandals we visited today,” said endocrinologist Soumik Goswami of NRS Medical College and a member of Protect the Warriors (PTW) that organized the inspection. PTW is an organization of medics working to spread awareness on Covid. It is the second the organization conducting such inspections. Some of the pandals the teams visited on Friday included Mohamad Ali Park, Santosh Mitra Square, Chalta Bagan, Singhi Park and Maddox Square. Some of the pointers the doctors teams inspected during their visits included if they had separate entry and exit points, awareness material on Covid-19, emergency medical facilities, crowd-control measures and if the pandals were erected according to the government guideline. TimesViewListening to health experts’ advice has never been so important. Both organisers and pandal visitors must keep all the dos and don’ts in mind.“We came across most pandals abiding by the Covid-19 norms. Apart from minor suggestions, we did not have much to tell the organizers at most places,” said Nivedita Das, public health specialist attached with College of Medicine and Sagor Dutta Hospital. PTW will be visiting more pandals in Kolkata on Saturday. Apart from giving its suggestions on preventing the disease spread during the festival, the organization will also be awarding Covid Joyee Sharad Samman to pandals comply with Covid protocols. “We started with pandals in the city last year and this year we have got requests from many organizers from the districts to visit their pandals for suggestion and support on Covid awareness. This year, we expect bigger footfall at Puja pandals since most are vaccinated. Hence, the responsibility cannot be left to the organizers alone. People visiting pandals too need to play their part by adopting to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said PTW secretary Abhik Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-team-checks-cov-compliance-at-pandals/articleshow/86879628.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

There will be no changes now, it’s full and final,” he said. Following a few days of speculations that Lourenco was preparing to quit Congress to join AAP, Lourenco had on Tuesday announced that he would stay with the party. His announcement came following Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s intervention. He stressed that though his differences with the party persist, he would prefer to see “the larger picture” of how to take the state forward. “That chapter is closed. We have to now think of the future of Goa. There should be policies and fixed defined rules for the state,” Lourenco said. To a query, he said that he has taken up the challenge of garnering public support in favour of the party. “We will see that the next government is ours,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/decision-to-stay-with-cong-final-lourenco/articleshow/86879044.cms||---

As a result, their fundamental right to livelihood as declared by the Supreme Court (SC) in the case of ‘Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union versus Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation’ is being violated,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor noted. While issuing notices to the respondents for final disposal at the admissions stage on October 27, the judges directed the state urban development department (UDD) to take an appropriate decision on Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s proposal for TVC’s constitution and notification. The bench was hearing a petition by ‘Bhaji Va Fal Mutton, Chicken, Macchi, Chaha, Pan Che Vikreta Footpath Dukandar Sanstha’ through counsel Mohammed Ateeque. They contended that after they were “forcibly evicted” from Jaripatka market on the HC’s directives, they were divested of their right to earn their livelihood by street vending, in violation of the 2014 apex court’s orders. Countering them, NMC counsel Jemini Kasat pointed out that nothing can be done unless and until TVC is duly constituted and notified by the government. He submitted that NMC sent a proposal in this regard, under the ‘Maharashtra Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Rules, 2016’, to UDD for approval and issuance of notification, but it is yet to be approved. “Unless and until the TVC is constituted and notified, it would not be possible for the respondents to effectively implement the provisions of the 2014 Act. The mandate of law is that they should be implemented as soon as possible within six months. That would mean that the whole process from constituting TVC to framing of the scheme must be completed in this period. It is not in dispute that the 2016 Rules have been framed under Section 36 of the 2014 Act and came into force from August 3, 2016,” the judges said. They added that the government ought to have complete the whole process, including TVC’s constitution, by February 2, 2017. “The scheme is yet to see the light of day. This is quite disappointing. The NMC counsel submitted that if necessary directives are issued to the government, all problems relating to and arising out of street vending by the hawkers will be solved. We are given to understand that the proposal was pending with UDD since January 1, 2021. We are not aware of the reasons why no decision has been taken,” the bench said. The petitioners pointed out that the respondents, including UDD and NMC, did not conduct any survey of street vendors, who were members of their registered society and were removed from the area illegally, even as the HC directives in the petition (no. 1453/2021) were only confined to those carrying out illegal business. They added that the respondents failed to protect the vendors from their eviction as mandated under Section 3 of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-hawkers-vendors-suffering-due-to-govts-failure-to-form-tvc-hc/articleshow/86879045.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||IT firms, startups hope for time-bound implementation of govt’s new policy||Panaji: The state government needs to implement the Goa Startup Policy 2021 in a time-bound manner with clear guidelines and clarity on the rollout of the incentives, said startups and entrepreneurs. Speaking to TOI, stakeholders and beneficiaries of the policy incentives point out that while the department of Information and Technology’s claims that startup scheme applications will be processed in 45 days, most applications under the earlier policy, which lapsed in September, were pending for 12-18 months. Startups and IT firms let out a sigh of relief after the state government cleared the long delayed Goa Startup Policy 2021, but said that a sluggish implementation of the scheme and its incentives will prove to be a dampener. “Theoretically everything is great. Time-bound implementation is the bottleneck, so if somehow we can make timelines part of the policy and attach fines and penalty to those who are responsible for implementation, things will improve,” said a lady who is part of a digital startup. The department of Information and Technology (DoIT) has yet to disburse some of the incentives that were cleared, which lapsed in September. The Startup Promotion Cell’s High Powered Committee, which is headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant, cleared 12 applications from startups and cleared incentives for nine startups on August 5 under the Goa Startup Policy 2017, but the funds, though disbursed on Thursday, were yet to hit the accounts of some of the beneficiaries. Around Rs 17 lakh was released as incentives under seed capital, co-working space, interest subsidy and trademark reimbursement schemes of the policy. “The SPC does not reply to emails. Many startups have sent dozens of emails but rarely get a response. We have to Whatsapp them about our email and then call them to follow up,” said a director at one of the startups. Ever since the state cabinet accorded approval for the revamped startup policy on September 30, tech entrepreneurs have been searching high and low for a copy of the new policy. The delay in disbursal of funds and the lack of clear answers has confused IT stakeholders. IT professionals and firms say that Goa’s startup ecosystem requires skilled talent, investment, mentorship and the feasibility to commence a venture as well as exit when the startup fails. “If startups have to flourish some established firms too need to setup large development centers to build the talent pool. We should also invite large corporates like Infosys and Wipro to set shop in Goa by offering them tax benefits under the STPI and SEZ schemes,” said chief operating officer of Kilowott Nitish Raikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/it-firms-startups-hope-for-time-bound-implementation-of-govts-new-policy/articleshow/86879085.cms||Newton Sequeira

Speaking at a party workers’ meeting in Solapur, he said, “The government guests have arrived at Ajit Pawar’s doors. We don’t worry about these guests. I too had got a notice from the Enforcement Directorate regarding a bank before the elections. I was never a member of that bank, nor had I taken any loan. The BJP is misusing power. People will show them their place.” Supriya Sule at a Navratri celebration in Thane on FridayPawar appealed to party workers to hit the streets to ensure 100% success of the bandh called on October 11 over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. “The farmers had hit the streets in Lakhimpur Kheri to raise their demands with the UP government led by the BJP. Cars of BJP leaders hit the farmers who had gathered peacefully there,” he said. Ajit Pawar said he will speak about the I-T raids on the properties of his relatives and aides once the officials have finished with the search operations. Speaking on the sidelines of the Covid review meeting to the media on Friday, he said that he did not want to obstruct the I-T department’s work. “The department is doing its job. The officials are still there. Once they leave, I will issue my statement,” he said. Lok Sabha member from Baramati, Supriya Sule, has indicated that the I-T raids on her cousin Ajit’s relatives were politically motivated. Sule said in Thane on Friday that her party never indulged in ‘politics of revenge’. “We have been in power for long but never considered out opponents as enemies,” she said.

He told reporters here on Friday after inspecting various direct procurement centres and government and private rice mills in Thanjavur that 45 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured last year, but this this year it would be more. Explaining the arrival of more grains at the procurement centres, the minister said, “Sugarcane farmers have shifted to paddy in large numbers this year due to inadequate payment of cash to 1.5 lakh farmers who cultivated it last year. This has increased the area of paddy cultivation.” TNCSC had been asked to procure entire produce brought by the farmers to the centres without fixing a ceiling of 2,400 tonnes, he added. He said procurement and transportation of paddy to other districts have been taken up on a war footing as directed by chief minister M K Stalin as the harvest of kuruvai paddy has gained pace in delta districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/centre-urged-to-hike-paddy-moisture-limit/articleshow/86879511.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Restaurants in Kolkata seek late-closure permission to make most of night restriction-free Puja||KOLKATA: A large number of restaurants across Kolkata have applied for a late-closure permission on all Puja days — October 12-15 — anticipating a sharp rise in footfalls during the festival. They expect the curb on entering pandals will divert many to their favourite eateries. While most would seek permission to stay open beyond the scheduled hours for not more than two Puja days till 2019, this time many have sought an extension for four, even six days. Bars and restaurants are now allowed to stay open till 10.30pm. Mocambo and Peter Cat have sought a late-closure permission for six days starting October 12, something it has never done before. “This Puja is going to see a huge turnout across restaurants for pandalhopping has been restricted. Since not everyone is allowed inside pandals, many would be dissuaded from going on a puja-watching spree. They would rather keep it short and wind up by visiting their favourite restaurant,” said Mocambo and Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari. The Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) has written to the state chief secretary, pointing out that since night curfew (11pm-5am) has been lifted for the Pujas, a ‘similar clearance’ should be granted to bars and restaurants. “Unlike last year, the fear has receded and people are desperately looking for an alternative to pandal-hopping. So, restaurants should be allowed to operate till at least 1am,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who also owns Song-Hai restaurant. Oasis on Park Street, too, has sought a late closure for four days. “We are waiting for the permission. It will be good if it comes through for the crowd could indeed be larger than previous two years,” said owner Pratap Daryanani. Amber on Waterloo Street has not applied for late closure but plans to stay open till midnight if the restrictions are lifted. “If late closure is allowed, we can stay open till midnight,” said owner Sanjay Khullar. “It is going to benefit the industry as there is no night curfew during the festivalWhen almost everything is operating normally, then the restaurant industry shouldn’t suffer either,” said Pratik Agarwal, owner, Sabka Club. “This is a time when we can make up for the losses that we have suffered through the year. Also, a majority will be stepping out at night during the festival and if eateries close early, they will be forced to flock back to pandals which could lead to crowding,” said Moumita Ghosh, partner, Miam Cafe & Bistro in Salt Lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurants-seek-late-closure-permission-to-make-most-of-night-restriction-free-puja/articleshow/86879613.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The arrest was carried out on the basis of a specific complaint by the victim's father. The police are likely to ask the girl to record her statement before a magistrate soon. The police said they had slapped stringent POCSO sections read along with molestation under the IPC sections. According to police, the victim's father - the family resides in the Mominpore area - came to the police station on October 7 around 8.30 am and alleged that his daughter's Biology teacher had misbehaved with her. "It was alleged that the accused touched her inappropriately and even tried to forcefully kiss her. "The accused had tried to take advantage of the victim's loneliness - she was asked to stay back in the room alone - during her tuition classes located on the second floor of the accused's premises," said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai.

---||Nagpur||Take immediate steps to address all issues of LIT: HC||Nagpur: After failing to fill up vacant posts of teachers at Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) despite repeated directives, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday passed several strictures on the Maharashtra government and Nagpur University. The judges directed both to take immediate action on this and other aspects adversely affecting the functioning of prestigious institutions. On January 17, 2019, a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande (retired) and Vinay Joshi asked the government and NU to complete all formalities like issuing advertisements and conducting interviews for filling up 17 vacant posts sanctioned as against the demand of 30. Accordingly, NU floated an advertisement, but managed to fill up only eight posts of professor along with associate and assistant teachers. It could not fill up the remaining nine posts as “none of the candidates were found suitable”, as per NU officials. The HC then constituted a panel under former vice-chancellor of Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai, Ganapati Yadav to study and suggest measures to develop LIT into a world class institution. After the panel submitted its report to the government and NU on February 17, 2020, no action was taken for its implementation. Flaying the respondents, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor stated that there is nothing on record which shows that they considered this report and initiated a process for implementing its recommendations. They asked both respondents to file their responses to the Yadav panel recommendations without fail before the next date. “Some of the recommendations suggest that an immediate course of action on certain aspects highlighted in the report is required to be taken. The area where immediate course of action is required is of deficient faculty positions and support staff availability. The report notes that there are 62 sanctioned faculty positions of which 24 are vacant,” they said. LIT alumnus Prasanna Sohale had approached the judiciary by filing PIL (No 43/2018) through counsel Rohit Joshi contending that the once famous institute was now slowly losing its reputation due to lack of basic facilities and ever-growing vacancies. It had caused decline in the quality of education being imparted to 680 students in one of the oldest institutions of India imparting education in the chemical engineering field. On August 29, 2018, HC had directed NU and government to start recruitment at LIT. Subsequently, NU wrote to the state seeking permission to appoint 30 teachers against a sanctioned intake of 62. Filling up of these posts would enable NU to receive deemed university status for LIT as suggested by Union minister Nitin Gadkari. While stressing that the post of registrar, controller of examinations and finance officer must be created, the Yadav committee pointed out that the post of placement officer has been lying vacant since 2015. It highlighted that the institute does not have a sanctioned post of librarian and store officer, which must be created without any delay. “There is not a single laboratory assistant working in this glorious institute since the last 10 years and there is an urgent need for sanction of adequate number of support staff for performing administrative functions,” the judges said, before adjourning the hearing by two weeks.

---||Goa||First charter may reach Goa by mid-Nov||Panaji: The first charter of the season may land in Goa by mid-November even as the Centre will start issuing visas from October 15. The operators are looking at November since all activities such as finalisation of landing schedules and marketing have normally to be done a month or two preceding the start of the tourist season. “The process has just begun. Aircraft need to obtain landing permissions, secondly, tour companies will have to start marketing the destination. Once that starts, we will know how many tourists are likely to come. Technically, things have started moving. I expect Goa to start receiving charters by mid-November,” said Nilesh Shah, president of the travel and tourism association of Goa (TTAG). With the Centre finally lifting the ban on international commercial flights, all those activities will start now, and operators are optimistic about the good season, Shah said. Abida Kumar, vice-president (operations) at Minar Travels, said that it can’t be said when their first charter of the season will arrive, as the schedules have not been out though they applied a month ago. “Normally, by August we used to get our full schedule. With visas to be issued from October 15, I expect the first charter of the season should land in Goa by mid-November,” said Kumar. Melroy D’Costa, station manager, however, said that it would be too early to give a date as to when charters would start arriving, as the announcement was just made a day ago. The next big task, D’Costa said, would be the protocol that tourists would be required to follow in India. “Once we have a clear picture about the protocol, we can send it to tour operators. Then the sale of tickets would start. We are already running short on time. Normally, the preparation time is of two months. I think we will have the first flight by November 17,” D’Costa said. Shah said that though the charter season is likely to take off a month late, the feedback from operators so far has been positive, and tourists are keen to visit Goa. Normally, Goa receives its first charter of the season by the third week of October. Operators are also happy about the latest announcement by the UK government. After it had declared that it recognises Covishied but not the vaccine certificate issued in India, and made it mandatory for Indians fully vaccinated with Covishield arriving in the UK after October 4 to undergo 10-day quarantine, the Indian government retaliated with similar curbs. With the UK doing away with the restrictions towards fully-vaccinated Indian travellers, India too is expected to loosen entry restrictions for people travelling to India from the UK. “It is a good sign that the UK has lifted entry restrictions for fully-vaccinated Indian travellers. It will help boost international travel and tourism. Good thing is that the issue has been sorted out before the tourist season started,” Shah said. Goa receives a sizable number of tourists from the UK, and tour operators were worried that the ten-day mandatory quarantine will keep away the UK holiday crowd from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/first-charter-may-reach-goa-by-mid-nov/articleshow/86879069.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Goa: DoE allows offline exams for Class XI, XII students, outlines SOPs for schools||PANAJI: The directorate of education (DoE) on Wednesday permitted higher secondary schools to call students to institute premises for their Class XI and XII formative and term tests. Director Bhushan Savaikar said that the decision was taken based on several requests from higher secondary schools. The DoE has also outlined the SOPs to be strictly implemented by schools, which include not allowing school staff or teachers on premises if they are not vaccinated. Such staffers will have to mandatorily produce a negative RT-PCR report every seven days. “During the Covid-19 crisis, the DoE has received quite many requests from various higher secondary schools to allow them to conduct examinations in the offline mode. Now, in order to maintain the standard of education, the government has decided to permit higher secondary schools in the state to conduct examinations in the offline mode for students of Class XI and XII,” Savaikar stated in the circular. The permission has been granted to schools only “provided they follow all necessary Covid-19 SOPs, protocols and guidelines issued from time-to-time by the central and state government/s”, DoE said. The number of students in a classroom will be limited to 50% of the room’s capacity. All social distancing norms have to be adhered to and students and staff should use a mask when in the school, the director said. “Every student/staff shall be checked for his or her body temperature before entering school premises. The entire school premises shall be sanitised every day prior to the opening of the school. Students having symptoms of Covid-19 shall be advised to have the test done immediately. Schools shall take all the necessary precautions and care to prevent cases of Covid-19,” the DoE’s SOPs read. Many higher secondary schools have scheduled their exams for Class XI and XII students as early as next week. The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has revised the scheme of evaluation for students from Class IX to XII only for the academic year 2021-22. As per the scheme, students are to be evaluated through year-round tests, so that there is no difficulty in assessing the students in case a public exam cannot be conducted due to the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/doe-allows-offline-exams-for-class-xi-xii-students-outlines-sops-for-schools/articleshow/86879622.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Voluntary Nature Conservancy (VNC), which has been conducting the annual count as a unique citizen science initiative since 2013, could not involve participants from diverse backgrounds last year owing to Covid-19 restrictions. “This time we have opened registrations to bring together participants for the count which is aimed at establishing a mugger crocodile population index in the lush green region of Gujarat,” said Anirudh Vasava, VNC research coordinator. “Last year, only our volunteers had participated in the count owing to Covid restrictions. This year, we involved other participants from other states too with relaxation of norms. But we will be following all Covid-19 guidelines and only vaccinated individuals can join as participants in the January event,” he said, adding that the registrations will continue till October 25. VNC volunteers had sighted highest number of reptiles in wetlands of twin districts of Anand and Kheda during the last count when in all 216 direct sightings were done in lakes, ponds and water bodies of 25 villages. “The programme helps understand crocodile’s distribution across Charotar. It provides participants an opportunity to see the landscape, humans, crocodiles and the complex relationship between these three,” Vasava added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ninth-charotar-crocodile-count-to-be-held-next-jan/articleshow/86877012.cms||---

---||Business||High on e-play, Tatas need to refuel aviation business||MUMBAI: The Rs 18,000-crore bid at which Tata Sons won Air India is just the beginning of its expenditure on aviation. It will have to allocate more resources to sustain aviation even as it makes ambitious moves in digital, hi-tech manufacturing and healthcare sectors. Though the company’s traditional businesses do not need capital, except for a few, its balance sheet is set to increasingly reflect investments in emerging businesses as it looks to capitalise on growth opportunities and aims to make at least one of them a cash-spewing machine like TCS. The software services major, which was spun off as a separate entity in fiscal 2005, contributes the highest (over 85%) to Tata Sons’ income. Money will, however, not be a problem with Tata Sons to finance acquisitions and invest in businesses as it enjoys the current steel upcycle, consistent performance of TCS and impressive market capitalisation growth of its operating companies. The market value of its investments is over Rs 12 lakh crore as against its debt of Rs 25,396 crore, placing Tata Sons in a comfortable position. This also allows it to raise capital by monetising its investments, something it has been doing whenever required.  “Telecom (Tata Teleservices) has been a thorn in Tata Sons’s bouquet for some years, but that’s been dealt with. Shareholdings have been raised in existing businesses (like Tata Communications and Tata Chemicals) and Tata Sons is in a comfortable position now. Besides, growth capital has been infused in units (like Tata Power and Tata Motors) to deleverage their balance sheets. It will not be a problem to push in more funds into aviation and other new businesses to support and accelerate their growth,” said a person familiar with Tata Sons’s moves. In recent months, the holding company of the Tata Group has spent considerable amounts to buy BigBasket, 1MG and Tejas Networks, among others, and it plans to spend more to outfight competition. Some trackers of Tata Sons, however, have reservations and feel that aviation, known to be a capital-guzzling and money-losing venture, could pull the salt-to-software conglomerate down. Internally, Bombay House, Tata Group’s headquarters in Mumbai, has estimated that the business will not make profit for five years till 2025, when global passenger traffic is expected to return to pre-Covid level. Tata Sons’ existing airline startups — AirAsia India and Vistara —in which it has invested more than Rs 6,000 crore since commencement of operations, have lost over Rs 9,000 crore till date. The aviation business has been hurt by high operational costs and bribery scandals at AirAsia India, among other factors. Air India’s back story too is not in Tata Sons’s favour — the carrier has not been profitable for the last 14 years. While Tata Sons may not put expansion capital into AirAsia India as its Malaysian partner is already in a detachment mode from the low-cost carrier, it will be deploying additional funds into full-service player Vistara, which has Singapore Airlines as a promoter. It may also have to shell out money equivalent to its Air India bid to restructure the carrier, which will be the second biggest purchase under Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran after Bhushan Steel. But, an industry person pointed out, “A lean cost structure is the key to script a success in aviation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/high-on-e-play-tatas-need-to-refuel-aviation-business/articleshow/86879908.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Nagpur||Coal supply hit by lack of imports, to improve by Dussehra: CIL chairman||Nagpur: The coal supply, which is critical currently, is expected to improve only after the Dussehra festival as the shortfall between supply and demand is expected to ease by that time. A perfectly normal situation can be achieved by March, when production would be enough for power plants to maintain a comfortable stock level, said chairman of PSU mining giant Coal India Limited (CIL) Pramod Agrawal. However, any sudden demand by the non-power core industry can also disturb calculations, he said. Agrawal was in the city to attend a meeting at Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), a subsidiary of CIL based at Nagpur. Agrawal said CIL with all its subsidiaries clubbed could achieve a daily production figure of 18 lakh tonnes as on Friday. Out of this, 15 lakh tonnes was given to the power sector. “However, nothing can be predicted. Hopefully, nature remains favorable for this level to be maintained,” he said. Agrawal accepted there is a coal crisis and power plants have stocks for as few as four days, which is not desirable. Ideally, a power plant needs more than 14 days of stock at any given point of time, said experts in the sector. However, at the same time, CIL has been able to meet more or less the entire requirement. There is a shortfall of over 50,000 tonnes per day even now, which will be plugged soon, he said. Once production is stabilized, the focus will be on non-power core industries. However, if the industries entirely depend on CIL as against imports, then the calculations may be disturbed, he said. Agrawal said this was an exceptional year for the coal sector. There have been excessive rains in coal bearing areas which hampered production. This was coupled with exports practically stopping due to high rates. This has increased the pressure on CIL. A fall in production during Covid months has also left its impact. After that, there was sudden demand. Now, it’s a lesson learnt that power plants should stock coal keeping the advance needs in mind, he said. Compared to last October, coal dispatch has gone up by 40% in the current month and output is higher by 12.5%. However, lack of imports has affected the balance despite higher production, said Agrawal. On WCL, he said the mines here have a higher stripping ratio, which means a larger quantity of earth has to be dug up to strike coal. A higher stripping ration affects viability, he said. The coal reserves are not going to last permanently. Considering this, even CIL is exploring alternate sectors. A decision has not been taken yet, but sectors like solar energy, solar power modules or even aluminum are being explored. A decision would be taken which sector would be a profitable venture, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coal-supply-hit-by-lack-of-imports-to-improve-by-dussehra-cil-chairman/articleshow/86879612.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Business||Three flights up, merger on cards?||MUMBAI: Long before Tata Sons even evinced interest in Air India, chairman N Chandrasekaran had sketched a blueprint for the aviation business. He told TOI in 2019 that he would not run a third airline in addition to Vistara and AirAsia India, unless they merged. Which means that an amalgamation of Tata Sons’s aviation interests, on the lines of consolidation initiated by Chandrasekaran in other segments like food and defence, is on the cards. But a person familiar with Tata Sons’s thinking said that the integration of multiple aviation units will be possible only after the chairman spruces up the business. “Air India comes with complexities — the onerous contracts, huge workforce & their employment agreements containing certain benefits and perks higher than industry standards, etc. Several issues need to be handled with care before consolidation moves,” said the person. Moreover, the Air India acquisition comes with a provision restricting the new owner from transferring its shares directly or indirectly to any person for one year from the date of closing the transaction. A merger is, however, allowed provided the new owner holds more than 51% in the carrier during the one-year lock-in period. It will also have to issue 3% of Air India’s shares to employees according to the terms of the deal. Air India has well-served one of Tata Sons’s reasons for bidding, as the transaction catapults the company to the position of the largest player from India on international routes and the second-largest on domestic routes. Tata Sons threw its hat into the Air India bidding ring because it had been looking for a solution for its sub-scale aviation business. In the same 2019 interview, Chandrasekaran said he wanted to scale up the company’s aviation business and needed “to find a solution” for it. Since then, the dynamics at Tata Sons’s aviation business have changed. It had bought Malaysian partner’s 33% share in AirAsia India, increasing its holdings to 84%. Tata Sons now has the option to buy AirAsia’s remaining 16% in the low-cost carrier by next year. Once the share-purchase happens and the brand-licensing agreement with AirAsia ends, the company will be offering a “white-label service”, which could then be combined with Air India or Vistara, said a different person. The Air India acquisition has, however, put the spotlight on Vistara and its co-promoter Singapore Airlines. While Vistara was initially evaluating Air India, Singapore Airlines got cold feet as the pandemic strained its resources. Singapore was also concerned about the investment Air India would entail and the risks that would follow the acquisition. Also, there was a conflict as Vistara, Singapore Airlines and Air India have competing full-service business models on certain domestic and international routes. The acquisition comes with a clause that Tata Sons will have to retain the Air India brand for a period of five years. Nonetheless, Singapore Airlines cancelled the non-compete clause in Vistara’s contract, allowing Tata Sons to participate in the Air India auction. But the island city-state is unsure of consolidation at this moment and is in a wait-and-watch mode. “Singapore would like to wait and see how Tata Sons’s aviation business pans out. It could then decide whether to be part of its consolidation story,” said a third source. At the moment, it is not known what Tata Sons’s brand architecture plan is for the aviation business. It will have five brands — Air India, Air India Express, Indian Airlines, AirAsia India and Vistara — in its portfolio after the Air India acquisition. Consulting firm Arthur D Little’s managing partner Thomas Kuruvilla feels the company could have multiple brands for different segments. “Tata Sons could play a well-known airline practice used in other parts of the world — mainly Europe and Asia-Pacific — by deploying different products under multiple brands for different market segments. India is a huge market with a differentiated demand structure — from domestic volume markets to premium leisure and business long-haul routes to labour markets and to religious traffic. Tata Sons could surely reduce costs and investments by optimising its networks, fleets, landing & parking slots, and ground services, among other things,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/three-flights-up-merger-on-cards/articleshow/86879959.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Business||We can’t afford daily hit of Rs 20 crore: Dipam secretary||NEW DELHI: For the government — which had at one point estimated the liquidation cost of Air India at over Rs 60,000 crore — the choice was between selling the airline now or waiting for a few more years to lose Rs 20 crore a day, which would have added up to Rs 7,200 crore a day, a top government official said. “The net worth would have dropped further (if sale was deferred). With the industry only expected to recover in 2023-24 and the number of uncertainties, the government needed to factor in the cost of supporting Air India, which was a minimum Rs 20 crore a day. Besides, there would have been further asset depreciation and asset obsolescence,” said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam). Pandey, who oversaw the sale, said that this was the best deal that the government could get given the massive loans and losses of the beleaguered airline. He said that safety valves have been built into the transaction to ensure that the interests of the Tatas are protected in terms of further addition to liabilities. Besides, the terms provide for Air India to hand over a certain number of planes in fully operational condition. For instance, 58 of A-320 aircraft have to be fully air worthy. While the new owners will have access to three buildings owned by the airline for two years, apartments allotted to employees will have to be vacated within six months as non-core assets such as real estate, including the iconic Air India building at Mumbai’s Nariman Point, are not part of the deal. Pandey also said that in future, the Centre will end the mandate for government officers to fly the national carrier, while adding that the sale will not impact the operations of Air India One, which flies the President and the Prime Minister, as the Indian Air Force has started running them. It is now called India One. And, when it comes to running rescue flights, such as Vande Bharat, the cost of operations were in any case reimbursed to the airline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/we-cant-afford-daily-hit-of-rs-20-crore-dipam-secretary/articleshow/86879980.cms||---
---||Business||AI sale leaves nearly 45k crore worth liabilities for government||NEW DELHI: The Centre will be left to tackle uncovered liabilities of a little under Rs 45,000 from Air India, largely comprising loans, after factoring in the debt being taken over by the Tata Group and the equity value being paid by the new owners to the government. More than the Rs 2,700 crore that it will get from the sale, the Centre is drawing comfort from the annual budgetary savings it will have from the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year that ends in March. Since 2009-10, the airline has been given cash support of Rs 54,584 crore and government guarantees of Rs 55,692 crore — leaving the Centre with an overall liability of over Rs 1.1 lakh crore. The guarantees were used to borrow from banks as the national carrier remained in the red for years. At the end of March 2021, it had piled up accumulated losses of Rs 83,916 crore — more than the Rs 74,602 crore that the Centre had budgeted to spend on health during the current financial year. The losses meant that the company had a negative net worth of Rs 44,507 crore, which means the value of assets was lower than the value of liabilities. For the Centre, the mammoth losses and liabilities were not the only challenge in finalising the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore — worked out using five valuation methods — as the impact of Covid-19 and projections of a full-scale recovery complicated matters. Once the Air India sale is completed, the Centre will get down to monetising some of the assets, including real estate and paintings, with the airline. Simultaneously, Air India Asset Holding (AIAHCL) will begin dealing with the liabilities. The Centre does not see major problems in AIAHCL tackling the debt given that 94% of the debt of the airline is guaranteed by government, which will not show the liability on its books. The holding company for the remaining liabilities and the non-core assets will either issue government-guaranteed bonds or the lenders will simply use the government guarantees and continue with the remaining loans, Dipam secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ai-sale-leaves-nearly-45k-crore-worth-liabilities-for-government/articleshow/86880014.cms||---

Although the airline itself is not listed any more — it was delisted in the mid-1950s after the government took over — punters were picking up select Tata stocks since mid-September, when the final date for putting in bids ended. The rally in Tata stocks has added nearly Rs 1 lakh crore to the group’s combined market value since September 14, with the current tally at Rs 23.4 lakh crore, BSE data showed. The biggest gainer has been Titan, which added about Rs 26,800 crore to its own and the group’s combined worth. The watches-to-jewellery major was followed by a Rs 25,533-crore addition by Tata Motors and another Rs 18,551 crore by TCS, the second-most valued company in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-companies-add-rs-1-lakh-crore-mcap-since-mid-september/articleshow/86880023.cms||---

One such was the panchayat of Mota Angiya village of Nakhatrana taluka,a quaint village of Kutch district. Even though remote and cut off from all modern facilities, the village has managed to achieve milestones in progressive thinking when it recently paved the way for Balika Panchayat — a panchayat for, by and of young girls — for women empowerment in the village. Sadly, the ravages of the killer Covid virus didn’t spare this village too. But thanks to its panchayat, which didn’t linger on for government aid alone, lives of many were saved after 19 people tested positive in the village with a population of 1,500 and only five died of Covid infection. With the help of an NGO, the village panchayat installed a kiosk that not only connected doctors from big cities on a big screen but also helped conduct vital tests on the spot and also provide facility to the doctors to prescribe medicines and tests. And what’s more, the consultation is done for free as the villagers are not required to pay any money to the panchayat. Realizing that the health of its own people is its responsibility, the panchayat started collecting health data of the villagers. Sarpanch Iqbal Ghanchi started to contact doctors and government officers to implement the idea of a helath kiosk in the village and during the process came in contact with ‘Punarjanm’, an NGO working in the sector of health, education and livelihood in around eight states. The NGO had developed a customized health kiosk in remote villages for instant care. The first such health kiosk was installed in Telangana and the second such kiosk was installed in the panchayat office of this village last week. “We have no medical facility in the village. The nearest government or private facility is in Nakhatrana which is six kms away. The panchayat which is managing the health kiosk is helping people by lining up with experts and doctors of government and private hospitals in big cities to provide consultations to the villagers on need basis,” sarpanch Ghanchi told TOI. A big screen connects patients with doctors on live stream using the internet and to ensure that the telemedicine process runs smoothly, the panchayat has also engaged one Asha worker to help people in getting the medical consultation. Jalpa Sukhanandi, development director of the NGO in Gujarat said, “We donate this device to remote areas so that people are not deprived of medical facilities provided the local institution is interested in managing it. In Mota Angiya, the panchayat has taken responsibility of operating and managing the device which will not only provide medical facilities to the villagers but also create new employment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kutch-village-installs-health-kiosk-for-timely-medical-help/articleshow/86879037.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Hyderabad||Telangana passes resolution for caste-wise BC census||HYDERABAD: The Telangana legislative council and assembly on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution urging the central government to take up caste-wise census of Backward Classes in the general Census for 2021. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao moved the resolution in the assembly stating that it was necessary to maintain accurate statistics to take up welfare measures for the poorest of poor. The CM also mentioned how several state assemblies and political parties across the country have started requesting the central government to take up the BC caste census and urged the Centre to take it up along with the 2021 Census. The CM said that BCs comprised 50% of total population in Telangana and that there was a general opinion to ensure that justice was delivered to them. Subsequently, speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy announced that the resolution was adopted unanimously. KCR had supported the demand for a caste census of Backward Classes on October 5 in the assembly and also favoured passing of a resolution. The central government has, however, informed the Supreme Court that conducting caste census of Backward Classes along with 2021 Census was ‘administratively difficult and cumbersome’ and called for exclusion of such information from the purview of the Census as a policy decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-passes-resolution-for-caste-wise-bc-census/articleshow/86880055.cms||---
---||Business||Dipam crew needs more hands to clear asset sale pipeline||MUMBAI: At investment banks, a top executive dealing with a transaction has several colleagues to assist. In case of the government, which has identified exit from non-strategic public sector companies for a major policy push, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, the Dipam secretary, has a small team of officers juggling between privatisation and the IPOs lined up. And some of the transactions are complicated, which require repeated prodding as rules and laws need to be changed along the way. For instance, LIC listing has thrown up multiple issues, some of which are going to be addressed in the coming weeks. Government officials told TOI that manpower constraints are going to be a major challenge to push forward the plan and there is a need to urgently address the challenge. In the coming years, disinvestment receipts are seen to be a major source of revenue for the Centre, although its record on strategic disinvestment and privatisation has been patchy so far. But the massive asset sales agenda that has been unveiled as part of the privatisation policy in the 2021-22 Budget calls for strengthening and augmenting the capacity of Dipam to implement plans. Since assuming power in 2014, the NDA government had made its intention clear to push ahead with strategic disinvestment of state-run enterprises, but a string of obstacles — including political opposition and bureaucratic lethargy — prevented any significant movement. The then A B Vajpayee government and its disinvestment minister Arun Shourie had successfully managed to undertake sales of government-owned hotels, Maruti, IPCL, VSNL and IBP. The process of strategic disinvestment was put on the backburner during the 10-year UPA rule due to opposition from its communist partners and other allies. The NDA swept to power in 2014 and triggered hopes of aggressive economic reforms including privatisation. The process was stalled for some years only to be rekindled with the move to undertake strategic sales in a string of companies such as AI, BPCL, Concor, Shipping Corporation of India and BEML. Dipam, the agency responsible for implementing the asset sales programme, has over the past few years been unable to push through decisions and often fell short of the annual target for disinvestment. It had to rely on ‘innovative measures’ to meet the targets and often pass off sale of PSUs to each other as strategic disinvestment. The reluctance of civil servants to push cases of strategic disinvestment despite assurances from the government has also often added to the delays and missed targets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dipam-crew-needs-more-hands-to-clear-asset-sale-pipeline/articleshow/86880057.cms||Surojit Gupta

Along with the officer, R Sekar, who was protector of emigrants in Chennai during the relevant period, a travel agent too was found guilty by the XI additional special court for CBI cases and sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment. A total fine of Rs 6.1 lakh was imposed on the duo. However, Sekar’s wife was acquitted of all charges. CBI, in October 2009, booked Sekar, his wife and Anwar Hussain, proprietor of M/s Classic Tours and Travels in Chennai on the charge of possessing assetsdisproportionate to known sources of income. According to the prosecution, the convicts had amassed wealth 471 % more than known sources of income. It said that between January 2007 and July 2009, Sekar and his wife entered into a conspiracy to acquire ill-gotten wealth to the tune of Rs 2.08 crore ,which were disproportionate to their known sources of income. Anwar Hussain had abetted the acquisition and possession of the assets by the government official and he was used as a conduit for collection of bribe in the form of speed money for issuing emigration clearance. The prosecution said Anwar Hussain’s travel company also acted as a manpower agency that sent workers abroad. Sekar had demanded a bribe ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 1000 to issue emigration clearance. While in office, Sekar had been clearing about 350 to 400 applications each day. Some of the bribe amount was also used for procuring engineering seat in a college for the IRS officer’s son, according to the prosecution. After perusing all submissions, A Thiruvenkata Seenivasan, additional judge, special court for CBI cases, held that the prosecution proved their arguments and sentenced the official and travel agent for rigorous imprisonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/irs-officer-found-guilty-of-graft-gets-4-years-in-jail-in-chennai/articleshow/86880077.cms||---

A division bench of Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup passed the interim order on Friday, on a plea moved by a group of farmers alleging largescale encroachment of the water body by Sipcot. According to the petitioners, 'Katrampakkam periya eri' is spread over 128.34 acres. It is part of a system of lakes leading to the Chembarambakkam lake. “The Chembarambakkam lake is located to the east of this lake and the Sugandiramedu lake is located to the west. Water from the Sugandiramedu lake will flow into the Katrampakkam lake and overflow from the Katrampaklkam lake will flow into the Chembarambakam lake, which is one of the largest sources of water for Chennai,” the petitioners said. In 2016, Sipcot levelled a major portion of the lake along the northern side, for construction of a truck parking yard. More than 10 acres of the lake had been filled in and constructed upon. “We were misled by the local authorities that the construction was not happening on lands in the lake,” they said. Again, in 2019, Sipcot employed earth-moving machines and levelled lands inside the lake on the north eastern corner, to the west of the village. However, after protest by villagers, Sipcot did not proceed with any activity, they added. “To our shock and surprise, a month ago Sipcot started fencing off 5-6 acres of the lake. We represented to the Sipcot project officer that this was illegal and to desist from encroaching the lake, however, the activity continued, and the erection of fence has been completed,” the petitioner alleged. Pointing out the claim of Sipcot that it had also acquired the lake and that they were free to do as they please, the petitioners said, a waterbody cannot be converted for any purpose and a waterbody cannot be allotted to any private party for industrial use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-structures-on-lake-madras-hc-tells-sipcot-others/articleshow/86880022.cms||---

The US delegation will meet Saturday and Sunday in the Qatari capital Doha with senior Taliban representatives, a state department spokesperson said. The United States has remained in contact with the Taliban since the longtime foes seized Kabul in August as US troops pulled out but the meeting will be the first that is face to face. "We will press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and girls, and to form an inclusive government with broad support," the spokesperson said on Friday. "As Afghanistan faces the prospect of a severe economic contraction and possible humanitarian crisis, we will also press the Taliban to allow humanitarian agencies free access to areas of need," he said. The state department stressed that the meeting did not indicate that the United States was recognizing Taliban rule in Afghanistan. "We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions," the spokesperson said. The US team will also press President Joe Biden's key priority of letting US citizens and Afghan allies during the 20-year military operation leave the country. The United States says that the Taliban have largely cooperated on letting out US citizens. Around 100 remain, predominantly US citizens with roots in Afghanistan who are undecided on whether to leave, according to US officials. But the United States acknowledges that it was not able to get out most Afghan allies who wanted to leave during a hasty airlift that pulled tens of thousands of people out of Kabul before the withdrawal. The spokesperson did not specify who would represent the two sides.

The airport handled 83,000 passengers in August as against 53,000 passengers in July. It is ranked third after Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. Bengaluru handled 80,000 international passengers in August, as per statistics from Airports Authority of India (AAI). Sources said that the numbers for Chennai are projected to touch close to a lakh for September and October. In the pre-Covid days, the airport used to handle around 5lakh international passengers. Though scheduled international flights are yet to resume, there is a huge demand from people travelling for education, business and leisure. AAI and airlines officials said that the pent up demand for travel will help the airport touch pre-Covid level patronage by end of the year if scheduled flights are resumed in November. Sri Lanka and Thailand opening up for vaccinated travellers following European countries, the ongoing Dubai expo and the IPL in the UAE are set to boost demand for travel for leisure and business in the coming weeks from the city. The government of India's decision to resume issuing visas for tourists arriving by charter flights from October 15 will also boost inbound travel. Sri Lanka, Thailand, countries in the Middle East are the most popular destinations from Chennai. S Baskar, managing committee member of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) said, “International travel is bound to increase in the coming months." A sample survey by Thomas Cook and SOTC among their customers across metros showed that around 77% of the respondents wanted to fly abroad for leisure in October-November-December period. Rajeev Kale, president & country head, Thomas Cook (India) Limited said, “Our survey highlights strong travel demand for the last quarter 2021."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/international-passenger-traffic-at-chennai-airport-spikes/articleshow/86880106.cms||---
---||Business||Total exit is new way to find buyers||NEW DELHI: When the government decided to sell its stake in Air India, it was not clear if it should completely exit the national carrier or remain a shareholder. It opted to retain some stake and the results were disastrous as the government failed to get any response. What it, however, did was make it clear to the Centre that private players may not be interested in buying a public sector company if the government retained a stake and had its nominees on the board. Learning from the aborted AI transaction, the government decided to not just completely exit the airline but also use the model for other PSUs on the privatisation list, be it Bharat Petroleum or Shipping Corporation. But AI’s privatisation — in the pipeline for nearly two years — is also expected to set the template for the government’s other disinvestment projects. For instance, even before the privatisation process for AI started, the government was clear that it did not want to give away land and real estate along with the company. So, these assets were hived off into a separate company. A similar strategy is being followed for other state-run companies. Further, the airline has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of government guarantees and it’s an issue that has resulted in several rounds of discussions between the finance ministry, department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), the ministry of civil aviation and EY, the transaction adviser. Some of the guarantees were critical for AI to borrow from the market to buy aircraft and raise funds later, especially given its precarious financial position. Then, there was the trickier issue of how to deal with employee benefits post-disinvestment. The government has opted for a simple formula — pay the benefits till privatisation, be it pension or medical facilities.

In contrast, Greater Chennai Corporation has made bidding, details of schedule of rates, submission of documents online, even abolishing the notorious ‘manual EMD (earnest money deposit) submission.’ The Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), popular as Metrowater, persists with the system under which men belonging to political parties and influential contractors stand near the engineer’s office openly blocking those coming to submit bids. Cartels are formed and though there are 490 contractors including 62 categorised as Class I (allowed to bid for projects above Rs75 lakh) only a couple bid for the projects. While some contractors use force to dismiss they don’t want as TOI saw during the submission of one tender in 2019, engineers don’t accept demand drafts (DDs) from contractors who they haven’t fixed the tender with. In many cases, bids and quotes are changed after submission. Photography and videography are part of the process, but malpractices continue. In a tender for operation and maintenance raw sewage pumping stations and secondary effluent pumping stations at places such as Kodungaiyur and Kilpauk in 2019, TOI saw men outside the superintendent engineer’s office blocking prospective bidders. Before 3pm that day, at least 10 such bidders being sent out. The contract was for three years and each tender was for Rs30 lakh- Rs70 lakh. About 72 such packages were floated. Senior Metrowater officials said they were aware of these malpractices and were willing to shift to the online process, but that it required political will. “We have proposed to do this but cannot be undertaken without political support,” said an official. Jayaram Venkatesan, the founder of anti-graft NGO Arappor Iyakkam who had exposed corruption in Metrowater tenders by sending a volunteer as a prospective bidder, said the e-procurement system of the National Informatics Centre had set up the portal and required software. “Departments like PWD, Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board and Metrowater just need to register and issue a circular to contractors stating it will be done online,” he said. The cartelized contractors may oppose it, but there are hundreds of others who would agree and it would help Metrowater save a lot of money due to competition. Activists want the Tender Transparency Act amended, the online tender process made mandatory and all forms of human contact including submission of DDs and documents to officials abolished. “GCC took 15 years to implement the online system and is reaping benefits,” Jayaram said. With Metrowater set to call for tenders in 2021-22 for construction of desalination plants and sewage treatment plants, a contractor who was once locked up in a hotel for taking part in the tender process told TOI, “The government will save lakhs of rupees and people like us will actually get work without paying commissions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-metrowater-continues-its-old-box-and-cover-tender-system/articleshow/86880185.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Kolkata||Prashant Kishor’s tweet sparks war of words between TMC & Congress||KOLKATA: Poll strategist Prashant Kishor broke his silence on social media after four-and-a-half-months on Friday, posting on Twitter that “there are no quick-fix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of GOP,” triggering a war-of-words between TMC and Congress. Kishor wrote, “People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP-led opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting themselves up for a big disappointment. Unfortunately, there are no quick-fix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of the GOP.” People looking for a quick, spontaneous revival of GOP led opposition based on #LakhimpurKheri incident are setting… https://t.co/41nNjh6pq9— Prashant Kishor (@PrashantKishor) 1633672307000Kishor’s statement drew sharp reactions from Congress. But it was Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Bagel’s response to PK’s tweet, which prompted TMC to even mention the “historical defeat in Amethi” to harp its point. In response to Bagel’s tweet that “people looking for a ‘national’ alternative based on poaching INC functionaries who can’t win even their own seats is in for a big disappointment,” TMC shot back, saying: “Rich words coming from a first-time CM. Punching above your weight doesn’t bring honour to you, Mr Bhupesh Bagel. What a shoddy attempt to please the high command! By the way, is Congress going to try to erase the historical defeat at Amethi through yet another Twitter Trend?” People looking for a “national” alternative based on poaching INC functionaries who can’t win even their own seats… https://t.co/SlcMWC4UFa— Bhupesh Baghel (@bhupeshbaghel) 1633684685000This comes in the backdrop of CM Mamata Banerjee saying on Wednesday that Congress must realise the reality that it has failed to fight BJP in Delhi and the last two Lok Sabha elections bear testimony to that. Last week, TMC general secretary Abishek Banerjee while speaking to party leaders in Tripura said, “Congress is non-existent. Every day there are four resignations. It has been reduced to a 1-1.5% party.” Kishor, who has publicly dissociated himself from IPac, the political advocacy firm he founded, is now a voter in Bhowanipore. I-Pac has signed up with Trinamool for the next five years, which will take it beyond the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. I-Pac is also helping to shape the TMC campaigns in Goa for 2022 and Tripura for 2023. On Wednesday, CM Banerjee wrote in TMC mouthpiece Jago Bangla’s Puja edition that “Trinamool Congress has shown that this battle (against BJP) can be won.” Saying that “time beckons Trinamool Congress to fill in the void in Delhi”, she added, “we are never talking of an alliance without Congress, even thinking of it. We are not worried about who leads the opposition front, but Congress has to realise this reality.” She added: “It is a necessity that all parties opposed to BJP forces should come together. Not for their own arithmetic, but this needs to be done for larger interests of the country. We must strengthen the opposition. This alliance will be on policies and programmes. Congress will be part of this alliance.” Referring specifically to Congress, she argued, “If there isn’t a fight in Delhi, then people’s confidence gets broken and BJP gets a few more votes (than it should) from the states. We cannot let this happen again. And if it happens (again), then there will always remain a vacuum in the opposition alliance.” While stressing on opposition alliance, TMC has repeatedly argued that a Congress-led opposition block automatically eliminates several parties who are opposed to it. Some of these parties, like AAP, TRS, YSR Congress and BJD, are in office in their respective states. Keeping them out weakens the opposition, TMC maintains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kishors-gop-tweet-sparks-war-of-words-between-tmc-cong/articleshow/86879684.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Enough is enough. Polls over, stop political wrangling, says Calcutta high court||KOLKATA: Elections were over and people had given their verdict and it was time to “stop political wrangling”, the Calcutta high court said on Friday while dismissing the CBI’s and ED’s petitions questioning the Bengal assembly speaker’s notices to them. Speaker Biman Banerjee had asked CBI and ED officers to appear before him on October 4 and explain why his permission was not sought while submitting charge sheets and arresting MLAs in the Narada scam case. The central agencies had moved the high court against the speaker’s notices. “Enough is enough... from both sides... enough of political wrangling. The electorate has spoken. It is embarrassing. Can you stop it? Can we please tone things down?” Justice Rajasekhar Mantha observed while hearing and disposing of the petitions on Friday. “It is made clear that this court has not decided on the propriety and validity of the proceedings before the learned speaker and all the issues shall remain open to be decided, if agitated by the parties in future,” he added. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said in court that the agencies would file a fresh appeal. The CBI and ED pleas in the HC questioned the validity of the speaker’s “summons” and dubbed them “unlawful” and claimed they interfered with their “impartial and independent” working. Bengal advocate-general SN Mukherjee told TOI that he had submitted in court that it was “a notice” and did not “amount to a summons”. CBI deputy superintendent of police Satendra Singh and ED assistant director Rathin Biswas had moved the court, pleading that the speaker’s “summons” be set aside. CBI, ED officers had met speaker after HC order Five CBI and two ED officers presented themselves before Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee on October 4 after the HC directed CBI officials to appear before him and “respectfully seek” an adjournment of his hearing. The HC asked the CBI in March 2017 to conduct a preliminary probe more than a year after the Narada scam surfaced in poll-bound Bengal. The CBI filed a FIR in April 2017 and, on January 28 this year, sought the governor’s nod — and not the speaker’s — to prosecute Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar gave his sanction on May 7, five days after the election results brought the Trinamool to office for a third term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/enough-is-enough-polls-over-stop-pol-wrangling-cal-hc/articleshow/86879606.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Didi to campaign for bypolls; Assam CM will bat for BJP||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will campaign for the month-end bypolls, which will witness high-decibel canvassing between the two sides that include a BJP chief minister and 12 ministers, including at least six from the Centre. Khardah, Shantipur, Dinhata and Gosaba go to the polls on October 30; Trinamool Congress and BJP had won two each in the assembly polls earlier this year. Trinamool’s star campaigner list has six MPs, including party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Saugata Roy, Subrata Bakshi, Dev Adhikari and Mimi Chakraborty. Bengal ministers Partha Chatterjee, Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim, Arup Biswas and Chandrima Bhattacharya too will campaign in the four assembly constituencies. Babul Supriyo, who is yet to resign as MP, and Nusrat Jahan will not campaign this time. CM Banerjee’s schedule is yet to be finalized, but she may go to Dinhata and Khard-ah, Trinamool sources indicated. From the rival side, BJP will field Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma as a campaigner. “Biswa Sarma’s dates are not finalized yet. But he will attend one or two roadshows in north Bengal,” said a Bengal BJP leader. “A lot of BJP workers in Cooch Behar who could not get vaccines in Bengal had gone to Assam to get vaccinated. Biswa Sarma’s presence will have an impact on people in Dinhata,” he added. TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said: “The campaign will revolve around issues such as the BJP government’s misgovernance, price rise and atrocities on farmers across the country. We will sho-wcase state’s welfare schemes such as Lakshmir Bhandar that have benefitted people.” Union minister for rural development and panchayati raj Giriraj Singh is likely to attend a roadshow in Khardah. Other Union ministers such as Smriti Irani, Subhas Sarkar, Shantanu Thakur, Pratima Bhowmik and John Barla have been named star campaigners for BJP. Party MP Nishith Pramanik has already been appointed the observer for Dinhata. Locket Chatterjee, who could not join BJP’s Bhowanipore bypoll campaign, is included on the party’s star campaigner list. Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh is the observer for Khardah. Party sources indicated that issues such as Citizenship Amendment Act were not likely to figure in the campaign while local issues would be raked up. “BJP workers are still falling victims to Trinamool’s post-poll violence. Whether it is vaccination or relief distribution, corruption has spread to the grassroots,” alleged Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. The party’s newly inducted national executive members from Bengal — Swapan Dasgupta and Anirban Ganguly — who campaigned in the last bypoll will not be taking part.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-to-campaign-for-bypolls-assam-cm-will-bat-for-bjp/articleshow/86879434.cms||Rohit Khanna

Forest officials said Harshini did not leave the zoo because of her two cubs. She has been tranquillised and put back in her enclosure, minister of state for forests Birbaha Hansda said. Two vets are closely monitoring the leopard. The mini zoo in Jhargram sounded an alarm in the morning after Harshini’s keepers reported her missing. A massive search was launched in the adjoining forests with the help of big cat trackers. Police, on the other hand, heightened vigil in urban areas of Jhargram because leopards are often known to stray into human habitat. Finally, zoo security guards spotted Harshini behind a bush. A forest department team, including tranquilliser gun experts, captured the leopard and reunited her with her cubs. A breach in the enclosure fence that allowed the animal to escape is being looked into.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/runaway-jhargram-zoo-leopard-found-on-premises/articleshow/86879436.cms||Sujoy Khanra

He said that the coal reserves at the power generation units were consumed and the daily power consumption has increased. The chief minister said that the power generation stations of the government, which supply 45 per cent of the state’s energy needs, have coal stocks just sufficient for one or two days. Because of the coal shortage, the power generation units in the state were generating only 50 % of their capacity, which is 90 million units per day. The Central power stations too were not being able to supply more than 75 % of their capacity per day, the chief minister said. Jagan said that the power demand in the state in the post-Covid era had increased by 15 % in September and 20 % in October. The state and the Central power stations were not able to meet the daily energy demand of 190 MU, the chief minister said. Because of this, power purchase in the open market, too had become a costly affair with ever increasing prices. The price in the market had increased from Rs 4.6 per kWh on September 15 to Rs 15 per kWh on October 8, the chief minister said. “The rates in day-ahead and real time power markets are soaring day by day and have reached the peak of Rs 20 per unit at most times of the day irrespective of the peak or off-peak hours,” the chief minister said. He further said that the “power is also not available at certain hours in the market due to less availability of generation in the country.” “It is quite an alarming situation and finances of distribution companies would deteriorate further if the situation persists,” Jagan said and feared that “unplanned power cuts once resorted to, will lead to chaotic conditions.” He wanted the Prime Minister to instruct the railway ministry to allot 20 coal rakes to the state to meet the present crisis. He also suggested that the stranded or non-working pit-head coal plants without PPAs or coal linkage may be revived on emergency basis. He also suggested that the deep water well gas available with ONGC and Reliance may be supplied on emergency basis to stranded and non-working gas plants in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-ys-jagan-mohan-reddy-writes-to-pm-modi-on-power-crisis-seeks-20-rakes-of-coal/articleshow/86880209.cms||Gopi Dara

Asserting there was no shame in sweeping floors, Priyanka Gandhi spent time with the members of the sweeper community. “Scores of women and sewage staff do this every day. It is a matter of pride and exemplifies the desire to serve and stay humble,” Priyanka said after sweeping the floor of the ashram. Later, talking to reporters, she said: “The CM’s comment smacks of his disregard for Dalits. Congress will not tolerate this attitude.” Earlier, responding to a query on a viral video of Priyanka Gandhi sweeping the room of a PAC guesthouse in Sitapur during her detention, Yogi said, “ Janata unko isi layak banana chahti hai (people want to make her capable of carrying out such tasks).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-a-broomstick-spat-with-yogi-priyanka-gandhi-makes-sweeping-statement-at-dalit-slum/articleshow/86880258.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The CBI moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court order that quashed the FIR registered against Suresh and his wife. The anti-corruption wing of the CBI in Chennai registered a case against TH Vijayalakshmi, wife of Suresh, and Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, in 2016. The case was registered after the CBI found documents pertaining to the assets of Vijayalakshmi during the course of investigation of another case. Suresh and his wife moved the combined high court at Hyderabad on the grounds that the CBI has registered the case without conducting a preliminary inquiry which is a mandatory requirement according to CBI manual. They also contended that the CBI has no jurisdiction to register a case in Tamil Nadu. They contended that the case was politically motivated and the assets shown as disproportionate are shown with inflated values than their actual value. The high court ruled in favour of them by quashing the FIR registered against them. Challenging the high court order, the CBI moved the Supreme Court arguing that no preliminary inquiry is required when they have incriminating evidence against the accused. The CBI argued before the apex court that they have gathered sufficient evidence pertaining to the disproportionate assets of Suresh and his wife beyond their known sources of income. Considering the arguments on both sides, the Supreme Court bench comprising Justice D Y Chandrachud, Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Nagaratna observed that conducting a preliminary inquiry before registering an FIR was not mandatory||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-sc-allows-cbi-to-file-fir-against-education-minister-wife-in-assets-case/articleshow/86880305.cms||Srikanth Aluri

While it named three accused who are already in custody, the name of Sk Sufiyan — CM Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in Nandigram — did not figure in the charge sheet. The agency had registered a case over Maiti’s death on September 30 following a Calcutta High Court order. The charge sheet, filed at the ACJM court in Haldia, names Sk Mijanur, Sk Fatenur and Sk Emdadul Islam who were arrested by Nandigram police following investigations into the fatal attack, allegedly orchestrated by Trinamool Congress supporters. “A few days ago, (BJP leader) Suvendu Adhikari had said 12 people will be arrested in the Maiti case. The CBI has filed its charge sheet against three persons. If new names are included at this point, it will be construed as a political conspiracy,” Sufiyan said. BJP’s Nandigram leader Pralay Pal said those “behind the murder” would not be spared. “We have faith in the CBI. Those who masterminded the killing will be booked,” Pal said. In another development, the CBI on Thursday night arrested two persons, including a minor, in the alleged murder of Palash Mandal in Kotwali, Nadia, on June 14.

In a letter to the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT), the health ministry has suggested free export of such products. The recommendations are based on deliberations in a meeting of the related Empowered Group-6 in September. The group has decided to revoke the restrictions and allow free export of these products, till further intimation, the letter said. TOI has reviewed a copy of the letter. The final call will be taken by DGFT. Diagnostic kits, including RT-PCR kits, RNA extraction kits and VTMs were added under restricted category for exports by the DGFT from June 2020, while RAT kits were included in the list in August 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-may-soon-lift-export-curbs-on-rat-rt-pcr-kits/articleshow/86880437.cms||Sushmi Dey

The National Family Health Survey 5 (2019-20) recorded that nearly 11% of children (under 5 years) suffered from wasting (low weight for height) against just 7% in 2005-06 or 14 years ago. Children with severe wasting has also risen by 4 percentage points. Analysis by the union government designated agency - International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, on nutrition-related indicators revealed the number of children suffering from anaemia has also risen by 10 percentage points (70% to 80%). Likewise, in the past 14 years, the number of anaemic children has increased by 10%. Both pregnant and non-pregnant women too recorded rise in anaemia by 2% and 10% respectively, revealed the state nutrition profile by POSHAN report by Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), International Institute for Population Science (IIPS), NITI Aayog and UNICEF. State has done better in some nutrition indicators like stunting (chronic undernutrition during critical periods of growth) from 51% to 39%. Ironically, the states saw an increase of population with obesity, hypertension and blood sugar. Percentage of overweight children rose from 2% in NHFS 3 (2005-06) to 4% in NHFS 5 (2019-20). Women and men recorded a 6% and 8% spike in the overweight population respectively. Lifestyle disorders such as high blood sugar and hypertension also made inroads in non-urban, tribal districts such as Dangs, Tapi, Bharuch and Porbandar. Dr Ritu Rana, public health nutritionist at IIPH-G, said the analysis is an excellent indicator for health and women & child development departments to develop a joint action plan. On the positive side, the state has improved on parameters like early initiation of breastfeeding and literacy among women from 60% to 77%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-gujarat-malnourishment-up-overweight-population-too/articleshow/86880429.cms||Parth Shastri

Rajneesh Sharma, the administrator appointed by RBI, has also been accepted as the same by the NCLT. Commenting on RBI move to NCLT, Srei Group founder Hemant Kanoria said, “It is indeed unfortunate for us. Our objective right from the beginning has been resolution. That is the reason we had moved to NCLT last year for payment to all creditors under section 230, which was not considered.” He pointed out that subsequently when the administrator was appointed this Monday, we moved to the Bombay high court primarily so that the investor process could be completed and a resolution is arrived at expeditiously and till that time the IBC proceedings could be stayed. “However, as the court did not accept and RBI has moved to NCLT today, so we will fully cooperate with the regulator to arrive at a solution. We have full faith in our country's regulator, government and judiciary that fair justice would be done,” Kanoria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-admits-rbis-insolvency-petition-against-2-srei-cos/articleshow/86879624.cms||---

Friday saw 19,503 cases and 241 deaths reported from across the country. The numbers from Assam, Jharkhand, UP and Uttarakhand were yet to come at the time of filing this story and are likely to push today’s tally past the 20,000 mark. The reduction in cases can be primarily attributed to the steady decline in positive cases from Kerala. In the past two weeks, the state’s tally has gone through a rapid decline. Compared to 16,671 cases reported on September 25 the state reported 10,944 cases today. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Mizoram were the only other states to report over a thousand cases. Kerala logged 120 deaths today.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-reports-over-19000-cases-and-241-deaths/articleshow/86880583.cms||---

What I have heard is heart wrenching. The entire country is crying for justice today. “There is nothing bigger than the Constitution. There has been an attempt to murder the Constitution, our democratic spirit and justice. The value of life cannot be compensated with money,” said Sidhu. Later, he sat on fast at the house of deceased journalist Ratan Kashyap, saying he will fast until accused Mishra, son of minister of state, joins investigations and is taken into police custody. He could be seen lying on a cot, observing silence. Sidhu also met the family of another deceased Lovepreet Singh (20). Sidhu was accompanied by cabinet minister Vijay Inder Singla, MLAs Raj Kumar Chabbewal, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Madanlal Jalalpur. Singla demanded that the BJP at the Centre immediately sack minister Ajay Mishra and arrest his son, who mowed down the farmers protesting peacefully. “BJP leaders, including Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, were regularly instigating the anti-social elements to attack the farmers protesting against three draconian agriculture laws of the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/navjot-singh-sidhu-punjab-congress-leaders-detained-at-sarsawa-then-allowed-to-go/articleshow/86880656.cms||---
---||India||25% of adults may not get fully vaccinated by the year end||NEW DELHI: If the regulations on a 12-16 week gap between the first and second shots of Covishield remain unchanged, at least around a quarter of India’s adult population will not be able to get fully vaccinated by the end of this year. As of 7pm on Friday, over 26 crore of the 94 crore adults or about 28% had not got even their first shot. Almost 90% of vaccination has been through Covishield, and there are only 12 weeks left in the year. With Bharat Biotech repeatedly failing to scale up the production of Covaxin to promised levels, its share in vaccination remains about 11.6%. Since the bulk of the vaccination would presumably be doses of Covishield, most of the population getting its first dose after Friday would be eligible for the next dose only sometime next year. The proportion of population which has not been vaccinated at all varies from as high as 43% in Jharkhand and 39% in Uttar Pradesh to nil in Himachal Pradesh, which could even fully vaccinate its entire adult population before year-end. Worryingly, the most populous states spuch as UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu would end up having the largest proportion, well over a third of the adult population, who have not been fully vaccinated by year end. J&K and Kerala would have barely 6% to 7% of the adult population left to be fully vaccinated if they can provide second shots to all those who have already got their first shots. This is only based on those who haven’t got any shots at all. In addition to these, there could well be those who have got their first shots but do not get the second by the end of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/25-of-adults-may-not-get-fully-vaccinated-by-the-year-end/articleshow/86880801.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad set to wear a green ring soon||AHMEDABAD: The concrete jungle of Ahmedabad will be encased in energizing lushness: 200 hectares of green public space has been planned, manifesting in 212 parks and gardens along the 76km SP Ring Road. The ring road will be lined by continuous cycling and walking tracks, open gyms offering indoor sports facilities, and outdoor grocery vends and food courts. The green vision has been finalized by Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA). The salubrious circle around Ahmedabad’s periphery aspires to create a new family zone for citizens. AUDA officials said that the work on the project is already underway. Currently, AUDA has demarcated the local city traffic passage, spaces for pedestrian and cycling tracks, multi-utility zones, and civic utilities. The area for the regional traffic ring has also been earmarked. “One of the key highlights of the plan will be green space allocated in line with population density,” a senior AUDA town planning official said. “There will be 64 neighbourhood parks, each covering up to 0.4 hectares. There will be 121 community parks, taking up 105 hectares all put together. Each community park will span 2 hectares.” The third and bigger category of open space comprises 27 city parks encompassing the total area of 80.24 hectares with each city park measuring 8 hectares. To put the project in perspective, the Sabarmati riverfront has 42.8 hectares for parks and gardens. “One of the outcomes of the green band along the SP Ring Road will be a reduction in traffic conflicts between the local traffic and the regional traffic. Thus, accidents and fatalities will be curbed,” the official said. The SP Ring Road, according to a November 2019 study carried out by LD Engineering College, is marred by as many as 18 major accident-prone spots. Auda planners said that the special affordable housing zone conceived along the ring road in 2014 freed up the open space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-set-to-wear-a-green-ring-soon/articleshow/86880747.cms||Paul John

---||Chandigarh||Ranjit Singh murder case: ‘My grandfather died waiting for this verdict’||CHANDIGARH: “Had the decision come during the lifetime of my grandfather Joginder Singh (deceased Ranjit Singh’s father), his soul would have rested in peace. He died waiting for this day. But we are happy that we have got justice and the guilt of the accused has been proved. Today’s decision is like a balm on our wounds,” said Jagseer, son of deceased Ranjit Singh, while reacting to the CBI court’s order. Talking to TOI on Friday, Jagseer said he was eight years old when his father was killed in 2002 and it was his grandfather who had taken up the matter on various platforms so that the guilty persons are punished. He said his grandfather, who died in 2016 waiting for the verdict in this case, used to say that it is a fight among the unequals, as the accused were powerful, but he had great faith in the CBI and judicial system of the country. Jagseer lives with his mother and wife at his native village Khanpur Kolian in Kurukshetra district of Haryana. His two sisters are married. He had recently filed a petition before the HC apprehending that he may not get justice from the special CBI court Panchkula in this case. However, his plea was dismissed by the HC. Even on Friday, when the order was pronounced, he chose not to go to a special CBI court to hear the judgment and stayed in Chandigarh only before leaving for his native village. He does not remember much about the incident and the kind of pressure his family had to face in this case because the entire battle was fought by his grandfather, who was also the main complainant in this case. Anshul Chhatarpati, whose father was also murdered by the Dera Sacha Sauda chief chief, said Jagseer was too young to understand the things when his father was murdered but he can understand the atmosphere of fear in which his family has lived in all these 19 years. Anshul said that entire credit for their fight goes to Jagseer’s grandfather Joginder Singh and added that the decision would be a major respite to the victim’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ranjit-singh-murder-case-my-grandfather-died-waiting-for-this-verdict/articleshow/86880953.cms||Ajay Sura
