---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Straight six day hike in fuel prices||BHOPAL: The sixth straight day of price hike pushed fuel rates to a new record high. Petrol price was Rs 112.65 per litre on Sunday and diesel rate was Rs 101.88 per litre. Fuel prices have risen each day in the month of October, expect on October 4. The continuously rising fuel prices has upset the already strained home budget. “There was a buzz when petrol prices were about to touch Rs 100 per litre, but now it is selling at Rs 112 and constantly rising, but there is little uproar. Diesel price has also crossed Rs 100 per litre mark. Earlier, economic slowdown caused by the pandemic was an excuse but now revenue receipt is going up, there is unprecedented boom in the share market. Why can't the governments reduce tax on petrol and diesel,” said Devendra Pandey, who was refueling his car at a petrol pump in Shivaji Nagar. Traders and transporters warn the possibility of inflation of the fuel prices are not controlled. "The prices of essential goods are rising, and increasing diesel price is the main cause for it. Now, diesel rates are going up again. It's beyond Rs 100 per litre mark now. This will push up the already high prices of common goods,” said general secretary of Bhopal Kirana Vyapari Mahasangh, Anupam Agrawal. Thakur Lala, a transporter, said “ Prices of all commodities are bound to go up as the transportation cost goes up. A trip to Mumbai or Delhi is costing us Rs 6000 more than what it used to be when diesel prices were kept less deliberately to avoid rise in prices of essential commodities.” President of MP Petrol Pump Owners’ Association, Ajay Singh, on the other hand, ruled out the possibility of crude prices in the international market coming down unless and until OPEC countries decide to raise the production of crude. “Crude consumption in Europe and America goes up during winter which jacks up its prices in the international market. If prices of petrol and diesel have to come down, the state and the central government should find a formula to give substantial relief to consumers. Softening crude prices in the international market won't make much of a difference either at a time when both petrol and diesel are selling for more than Rs 100 a litre", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/straight-six-day-hike-in-fuel-prices/articleshow/86921275.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

It is the ancestral home of Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. A text message from Holland, around 7am on Sunday, buzzed in this house to tell his relatives he had died in Islamabad just a few minutes earlier. “Blood relation hai. Koun inkaar kar sakta hai?” AQ Khan's cousin, 79-year-old Agha Abdul Jabbar Khan, sighed when TOI called him, stopping short of repeating Harper Lee’s famous lines from ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ – ‘You can choose your friends, but not your family’. Various online accounts of Khan leaving right at the time of Partition in 1947 stand corrected. He left India around 1951-52, after completing his secondary school education, say his Bhopali relatives. AQ’s father, Abdul Ghaffur, refused to follow him. “My father and uncle never went to Pakistan. They were educated people, who understood the call by leaders like Maulana Abul Kalam Azad,” said Jabbar. Jabbar’s father was a graduate and teacher, who retired as a headmaster from Hoshangabad in Madhya Pradesh with a pension of Rs 79. To put it in context, in the 1950s a teacher’s salary was only Rs 45. It has been 49 years since AQ Khan stepped foot in his ancestral home in Bhopal. He came to Bhopal to pay his respects after the death of Jabbar’s father in 1972. Many did not know about AQ’s Bhopal connect until the scientist's nuclear-proliferation activities became public. The N-word isn’t uttered in this household. The family does talk about AQ Khan’s love for anything Bhopali – hockey, fishing, kite flying et al. That part of the conversation is jovial. They recall how he would call Bhopal the Switzerland of India. But questions about how a quiet teen from Bhopal turned out to be a nuclear non-proliferation threat are politely off-tracked. There are no secrets in this home at Ram Phal Wali Gali in Ginnori. It has a mosque minaret looking over the house, like Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, which was a stone’s throw from AQ's detention residence in the Pakistani capital city. During his last visit to India in 1972, AQ Khan is said to have told his close acquaintances, “From now on, I will visit you very often, or never.” For good or bad, the latter turned out to be true.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/blood-ties-little-else-aqs-kin-back-home-in-bhopal/articleshow/86921294.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Kolkata||Restaurants happy with new SOP, ready to welcome Puja crowd||The state government declared SOPs for restaurants and bars during Puja on Sunday and eatery owners are quite happy. After witnessing the crowd visiting restaurants and pubs, the owners had already anticipated that there would be high footfall and after the public was barred from entering pandals, restauranters are confident there would be high footfall during the five days of Puja. “Food is one of three main entertainments during Puja. The rest of the two – cinema and pandal hopping — will not attract much crowd,” said Debaditya Chowdhury, managing director of three restaurant chains. According to a report by British Council, based on the data of pre-pandemic (2019) Puja, the food and beverages industry in Kolkata does around Rs 2,854 crore business during the Puja month and consumer spending goes up 30% higher than that of the previous month. While the restauranters are sure that the 2021 market will not be as big as 2019, but at the same time, they are hopeful that things would be close to ‘normal’. And so, they are making all arrangements to welcome guests. Cutting short the menu Anticipating the crowd, most restaurants are cutting short their menu and coming up with Puja-special items. Even though this change was pretty common in pre-pandemic time but last year almost every restaurant did it. “We are cutting down around 30% of the menu. Especially items that take a long time to prepare,” said Debaditya. Pratap Daryanani, the owner of a Park Street restaurant said they have come up with a combo menu for the occasion and are counting on it. Confusion over the sitting arrangement The recent SOP does not specify anything about seating arrangement and that has lead to several restaurants being confused about the situation. Many of the establishments are ready to increase their sitting capacity and make the most of the Puja month, but they do not know if it is going to be legal or not. On terms of anonymity, the owner of a Dhaba chain said, “Since pandemic, we have not done much business and the only expectation was August and September this year. In this situation, all of us want to make some money and clear the debts and the best way to do that is to increase the seating capacity,” he added. No compromises when it comes to safety The hotel and beverage industry placed a special request in front of the state government to let them run their services till 1 am during Puja days. The state government has allowed restaurants to keep their facilities open till the normal working hours. “This is a big help. But this doesn’t mean we will compromise on sanitization and COVID protocols. At the same time there will be temperature checks and other safety measures in place,” said Urvika Kanoi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurants-happy-with-new-sop-ready-to-welcome-puja-crowd/articleshow/86921406.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra
---||India||Nitin Gadkari seeks disclosure of palm oil mix in other packed edible oils||NEW DELHI: Raising concerns over the mixing of palm oil with other edible oils such as soya oil, Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday urged people to raise their voice for proper disclosure of such mixing on the packets in “bold letters”. “In many cases, soya oil sold here has up to 40% blending of palm oil. There is a need to raise the demand to force sellers to put out this message properly. They put out such information in small letters, which people usually miss. They must mention this in bold letters so that people can take the informed choice whether to buy pure 100% soya oil or blended oil,” Gadkari said while addressing an international soya conclave. The minister also urged the industry and research organizations to work on increasing the average production of soya crops to reduce India’s import of edible oil to nil. Currently, nearly 65% of the requirement of edible oil is met from imports. “We need to increase the soya crop production to 20 quintal per acre and that will encourage people for crop diversification. This will make us Atmanirbhar in meeting edible oil requirements,” he said. On the GM soya seeds, Gadkari said there has been a lot of reservation about GM seeds. “I know we have major issues with the GM seeds. But when we import the soya oil from other countries we are getting the oil produced from GM seeds,” he added. Recently, the government made it mandatory to mention “GM” label on packaged soya oil, which is made from GM seeds. This is aimed at informing people when they are buying the edible oil of their choice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nitin-gadkari-seeks-disclosure-of-palm-oil-mix-in-other-packed-edible-oils/articleshow/86921467.cms||Dipak K Dash

Attending the concluding ceremony of five-day Northern India Regional Agriculture Fair-2021 at SKUAST Jammu, the minister said, "This is the golden period of agriculture in India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and technological interventions, research and innovation in agriculture under his leadership will double the farmers' income by 2022." Singh said that the PM's seriousness towards agriculture development in India can be judged from the fact that two new ministries, Jal Shakti and skill development & entrepreneurship, have specially been created to promote agriculture. Singh said that agriculture and farm production has been revolutionised in India under the current government, which is evident from various initiatives taken for the welfare of farmers like the soil health card, neem-coated urea, PM Fasal Bima Yojana, PM Kissan Sammaan, e-Nam, etc. Enumerating the development initiatives taken in J&K vis-à-vis agriculture and innovation, Singh said that the establishment of north India’s first biotechnology park, two high-seed processing plants at Kathua, and launch of India’s first Aroma Mission will open new vistas of growth, opportunities and innovation in agriculture in Jammu. Speaking to farmers present on the occasion, Singh emphasized that a farmer can now engage in multiple activities depending upon his capacity and resources. He maintained that the government is facilitating farmers in every way possible to achieve financial prosperity. The minister further said that the proactive outreach for start-ups is the need of the hour to get the best minds for promotion of products at national and international level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/golden-period-of-agriculture-under-pm-modi-mos-jitendra-singh/articleshow/86922082.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||AQ Khan, ‘father of Pakistan's N-bomb’, dies of Covid||ISLAMABAD: Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as the ‘father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb’, died at a hospital here on Sunday after his lungs collapsed, severely damaged by coronavirus infection that he had contracted last month. Khan, 85, has been revered as a national hero for making Pakistan a nuclear power. Islamabad had detonated its first nuclear weapon in 1998 when he was leading the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) - a uranium enrichment facility that has been expanded to many other fields of science over a period of time - in Kahuta, near Islamabad. “Dr Khan was loved by the nation because of his critical contribution in making us a nuclear weapon state. This has provided us security against an aggressive much larger nuclear neighbor (India). For the people of Pakistan, he was a national icon,” Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan posted on Twitter after the nuclear scientist’s death. Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa said Khan's contributions in making Pakistan's defence stronger were “significant”. Amid tight security, Khan had been living a secluded life at his residence in Islamabad’s upscale E-7 neighbourhood since 2004 after he had admitted to a role in a massive global nuclear proliferation scam. In a televised address, he had accepted responsibility for illegal proliferation of nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Ex-military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf had sacked him from his position. The former president, however, had also granted him clemency using his discretionary powers but kept him under house arrest till 2009. “It would have been disastrous for Pakistan if I had not accepted responsibility,” the nuclear scientist had once said. In a 2018 book “Pakistan's Nuclear Bomb: A Story of Defiance, Deterrence And Deviance”, Pakistani-American scholar and academic Hassan Abbas has highlighted Khan's involvement in nuclear proliferation in Iran, Libya and North Korea. He wrote that the origins and evolution of the Khan network were tied to the domestic and international political motivations underlying Pakistan's nuclear weapons project. The writer also examined the role of China and Saudi Arabia in supporting its nuclear infrastructure. Khan is reported to have intimate links with China's nuclear establishment. The US State Department said in 2009 that Khan had run an “extensive international network for the proliferation of nuclear equipment and know-how that provided ‘one stop shopping’ for countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons”. According to the State Department, this network's actions had “irrevocably changed the proliferation landscape and have had lasting implications for international security”. Western diplomats have long doubted whether Khan could have acted alone. Talking to foreign media in the past, Khan had said the confession “was handed into my hand”. Khan was born in 1936 in Bhopal, India, and had migrated along with his family to Pakistan after the Partition. He studied metallurgical engineering in Berlin after completing a degree in science from Karachi University in 1960. Later on, he went for advanced studies to Netherlands and Belgium. After India’s nuclear test in 1974, he had joined Pakistan’s clandestine efforts for developing nuclear technology. For this purpose, he had founded the KRL in 1976 and was its chief scientist and director for many years until his removal by Musharraf in 2004 over accusation of running a rogue proliferation network for nuclear material. During the last few years of his life, he had been seeking help from courts to relax restrictions on his movement. “I had been kept as a prisoner having no free movement or meeting with anybody,” Khan wrote to Pakistan’s Supreme Court last year in a handwritten note against the state. Last month, he had complained that neither Imran nor any of his cabinet members inquired about his health when he was under treatment at a hospital. He was admitted to KRL hospital on August 26 after testing positive for Covid-19. Later, he was shifted to a military hospital in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. He was discharged from there few weeks ago after recovering from the virus. His health, however, took a turn for the worse last night when he started feeling discomfort in breathing due to bleeding in his lungs. At 7:04am, doctors pronounced him dead. He was given a state funeral at Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque before his burial at the city’s H-8 graveyard. His funeral was attended by cabinet members, parliamentarians and military officers among others. To mourn his death, the national flag was flown at half-mast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/aq-khan-father-of-pakistans-n-bomb-dies-of-covid/articleshow/86922198.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Rana, former MLA from Nagrota and provincial president of NC in Jammu region, and former minister Slathia, resigned from the basic membership of the party. Speculations are rife that the duo may join BJP in Delhi on Monday. Rana is the younger brother of Union minister of state for PMO Jitendra Singh and was a prominent face of the NC in the Jammu region. NC on its official Twitter handle wrote, “Farooq Abdullah has received and accepted the resignations of Mr Salathia & Mr Rana. No further action or comment is deemed necessary.” Rana has also removed his designation of provincial president of NC from his Twitter handle. Party sources said: “Rana, along with Surjeet Singh Slathia, may join BJP on Monday at the party headquarters in Delhi in the presence of party general secretary Arun Singh, Union minister Jitendra Singh, MP Jugal Kishore, former deputy chief ministers and J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina.” Rana, however, appealed to all political parties of Jammu region, including the BJP, to unite and adopt the Jammu Declaration to safeguard the interests of the region the way the people of Kashmir and the Union Territory of Ladakh had risen above their political and religious affiliations to take a stand on issues concerning their region. Addressing a large group of people from Nagrota, who called on him on Sunday morning, Rana vowed to pursue the Jammu Declaration religiously and resolutely, as he describerd the concept as key to retrieving the glorious ethos of an inclusive Jammu and Kashmir. “Nothing will deter me from realizing this objective and I will work for it even at the peril of my political career”, Rana told the gathering. Striking an emotional chord, the former MLA said that the declaration is the way forward for respecting the aspirations of all the regions and sub-regions of Jammu and Kashmir with none being discriminated against or dominated politically, socially and economically. “Each one, irrespective of region, religion and caste, must have equal rights on resources and in governance. Fair play and justice should be the bedrock of the political system. Even the perception of one being appeased at the cost of the other due to politico-strategic expediencies should become an imperative of the past. The Jammu region has suffered on all these counts over decades,” he said. On October 4, amid rumours of his exit from the National Conference, Rana had said that he was still in the party but was ready for any sacrifice for the cause of the people of Jammu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jolt-to-nc-as-dogra-faces-rana-slathia-quit-party-may-join-bjp-today/articleshow/86922371.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The SIT found Ashish “evasive” about his whereabouts at the time of the incident following which he was arrested late on Saturday night. A medical team examined him in the crime branch office. He was then taken to a judicial magistrate who sent him to custody, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said. Ashish was not able to explain the presence of empty cartridges in his vehicle. A forensic team had visited the site of the alleged killings in Banbirpur on Wednesday and recovered two empty .315 cartridges from Ashish’s vehicle. Ashish has been accused of shooting at farmers. The cartridges have been sent for a forensic examination. CCTV footage from the area is being scanned by experts. A senior police officer added that witnesses have told cops they saw Ashish at a petrol pump near the scene of violence when he came to tank up his vehicle, just a few minutes before some farmers were mowed down. The minister’s son is currently housed in a ‘quarantine cell’ at Lakhimpur district jail as per Covid protocol. He had skipped summons by the SIT on Friday, after which a second notice had been issued asking him to appear. According to the SIT, Ashish was unable to prove why his SUV (Thar) and a Fortuner, registered in the name of his friend, Ankit Das, were headed towards the protest site, despite police blocking the route for traffic and asking commuters to follow another. The administration had changed the route of deputy CM Keshav Maurya’s convoy and alerted BJP functionaries in the area about it after farmers planned a protest at the Maharaja Agrasen Sports Ground helipad where Mishra and Maurya were to address an event. Ashish had claimed that the SUV which mowed down farmers was driven by his driver Hari Om Mishra and that he was not in it. “During questioning, Ashish said he was at a wrestling event in Banbirpur village, 4 km from where the incident took place, and left the spot later to visit a rice mill. But he was not able to give satisfactory answers when he was asked about his location between 2.36pm and 4pm,” a member of the SIT team told TOI. The Lakhimpur incident took place at about 3.03pm. “There is clear evidence that Ashish was not present at the wrestling event at the time of the incident. We need to question him more and take him to the main site (of crime) for investigation. We will seek further remand on Monday," said the SIT official. Meanwhile, a forensic team accompanied by officials from the SIT visited the crime spot again on Sunday. Residents in nearby areas, too, were questioned. ADG (Lucknow zone) S N Sabat told TOI, "Since this is an important case, experts were sent from Lucknow. They will recreate the crime scene." Sources privy to the probe said forensic examination of the entire area where the killings happened would be done and videos of the episode processed "to zero in on the location of the key accused". Ashish’s counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh said they would apply for bail on Monday. "We will oppose the police's appeal for remand custody. We have sufficient evidence to prove that Ashish was at the wrestling competition. There were thousands of people there."

---||Business||Mood has changed, consumers bullish on economy: RBI||MUMBAI: There has been a huge change in public sentiment since the August monetary policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). People are less pessimistic about the state of the economy on all fronts and are optimistic about spending. When it comes to future expectations, consumers are optimistic about the economy, employment, income and spending. However, they are still wary of prices a year from now. “Consumers reflected lower pessimism on the prevailing general economic situation, employment scenario as well as household income and expenditure…,” according to the central bank’s September 2021 round of the survey. The results of the survey in terms of future expectations is one of the most optimistic in at least with Covid-19 pandemic casting a shadow on consumer confidence. The current situation index is the highest since May 2020 and the future index is highest since November 2020, the survey data showed. Since the lifting of restrictions across the country after the bruising impact of the second wave of the pandemic, several indicators have shown a robust recovery and indications are that the economy is expected to grow at near double digits in 2021-22. The RBI expects growth to be around 9.5% in the current fiscal year and also expects inflation to moderate with the arrival of bumper crops. It has, however, downplayed the impact of hardening crude prices and domestic prices and their impact on prices. Overall, the consumer confidence index improved to 57.7 in September from 48.6 in July. Consumer confidence for the one-year ahead period also improved. The future expectations index moved to 107 in September from 104 in July. An index value above 100 is a sign of optimism. According to the survey, consumers showed lower pessimism about the prevailing general economic situation, employment scenario as well as household income & expenditure. The current situation index (CSI) for September improved when compared with the earlier survey rounds conducted after May 2020. After the survey, there has been further easing of restrictions with places of worship being opened in Maharashtra. There have also been several rounds of increases in fuel prices following a rise in global oil prices. The future expectations are reflected in the consumer confidence for one year ahead. The future expectations index (FEI) improved further in September from July 2021, aided by higher optimism on the general economic situation and employment scenario. Households reported a rise in overall expenditure, largely due to higher expenditure on essential items. The pessimism on current and future discretionary spending, however, reduced in the latest survey round. In the August 2021 survey, sentiment had improved in respect of the economy and jobs. Respondents were more pessimistic about prices and income while their spending plans had remained unchanged. Along with the monetary policy statement, the RBI also released the monetary policy report published by a department of the central bank. The report said that domestic economic activity is normalising after the ferocious second wave retarded momentum. “The outlook remains overcast by the future path of the pandemic, the accelerated pace of vaccination and release of pent-up demand provide an upside to the baseline growth path. Headline inflation has fallen back into the tolerance band and the trajectory is expected to be driven by supply-side factors,” the report said. Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2021 round of the RBI’s industrial outlook survey expect the cost of raw materials and selling prices to rise further in Q3FY22. Services sector companies also see a rise in input costs and prices. “A faster resolution of supply chain disruptions, good foodgrain production and effective supply management could cause inflation to undershoot the baseline, contingent on the evolution of the pandemic and the efficacy of vaccines,” the report said. Another indicator of the change in the current situation is that the RBI managed to conduct its Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) for September 2021 through physical interviews in 13 major cities from 5,237 households whereas the earlier survey was done over the telephone. The surveys were conducted after several cities further eased Covid restrictions. In Mumbai, local trains and malls were opened to fully vaccinated members of the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mood-has-changed-consumers-bullish-on-economy-rbi/articleshow/86923961.cms||---
---||India||PM has time for US trip, but not for protesting farmers: Priyanka Gandhi||VARANASI: Highlighting the recent violence and deaths at Lakhimpur Kheri, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday said her party will “fight BJP like it fought for freedom from the British.” Launching the party’s campaign for the UP elections due in February next year, Priyanka said she is fasting for Navratra even as Congress sought to underscore its “secular” message by starting the ‘Kisan Nyay Yatra’ with Hindu, Muslim and Sikh priests reciting prayers before the start of the rally. With her forehead smeared with the trademark sandalwood paste from Kashi Vishwanath, a beaded rudraksha and vermilion thread around her wrist, and a Goddess Durga incantation on her lips, Priyanka sought to convey the right mix of political signals. The Congress leader set out a scathing criticism of BJP and PM Narendra Modi, alleging that Dalits, tribals, women, and marginalised were all feeling harassed under the BJP government. Flanked by Congress leaders, including Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda, and former Union ministers Salman Khurshid and PL Punia, Priyanka asked people to introspect about whether ‘Vikas (development and progress)’ had really come knocking at their doors as was promised by BJP. “Neither mallahs, nor mazdoor, women or farmers are safe in this country. Only the PM, his Cabinet and his corporate billionaire friends are safe. This country is getting destroyed... All the hoardings you see at bus stands have a dark underbelly. The reality is what you all see and deal with everyday. This country is not the personal property of BJP, you have to fight the good fight and support the Congress in bring change,” she said. Priyanka also alleged that all the victim families she met — from Sonbhadra to Unnao, Hathras and Lakhimpur Kheri — have appealed for justice not compensation. “These farmers who were killed brutally are the ones whose sons go and protect our frontiers. But they have no hope of justice from this government,” she said. “It is these farmers and their children who are protecting our frontiers... Modi ji has time to visit US and Japan, but no time to meet and talk to the farmers protesting 10 kms away from his house... He who calls himself a ‘Ganga Putra’ has insulted all the other Ganga putras,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-has-time-for-us-trip-but-not-for-protesting-farmers-priyanka-gandhi/articleshow/86924085.cms||Swati Mathur
---||India||Cops detain 430 overground workers after Jammu and Kashmir killings||NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: In a major crackdown on the terror ecosystem in Jammu and Kashmir days after a string of civilian killings, the J&K police have detained more than 430 alleged overground workers (OGWs) associated with different terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed etc and are questioning them on their terror links and alleged supporting role in the recent attacks. The agency also conducted searches at eight locations in Srinagar and Anantnag districts and arrested three persons in another case. In the targeted killings case, the suspected OGWs were picked up from across the Valley, prominently Srinagar, Anantnag, Kulgam and Shopian. One of those detained is a prominent drugs supplier based in Srinagar. As per a preliminary investigation, the local terrorists behind the killings were mostly neo-recruits or ‘hybrid’ terrorists lured by handlers, including from Pakistan, with drugs or money to carry out one-off attacks with pistols supplied by the latter. Incidentally, many of the OGWs picked up by J&K police appear to be addicts, said a source. Some reports said the agency arrested two operatives of the The Resistance Front (TRF) identified as Tawseef Ahmed Wani of Bangdara village in Baramulla and Faiz Ahmed Khan of Panzat in Anantnag district and more arrests may follow. The reports suggested 40 others had been summoned by the NIA for questioning, as part of the investigation into the killing of a woman school principal from the Kashmiri Sikh community and her Kashmiri Pandit colleague at a boys’ higher secondary school in Srinagar’s Eidgah locality last Thursday. The NIA also conducted searches in a ISIS ‘Voice of Hind case’ at eight locations in Srinagar and Anantnag districts and arrested three persons. The case relates to ISIS conspiracy to radicalise and recruit impressionable Muslim youth in India through online propaganda to wage jihad against the Indian state, the agency said. Those detained in connection with the targeted killings include youths previously involved in stone-pelting on security forces and Jamiat-e-Islami and Tehreek-e-Hurriyat activists. They are suspected of either having links with the terrorists or trying to foment communal tension in the Valley. The agencies have also identified the voice of the terrorist who figured in a video clip being circulated, where a new outfit called Geelani Force is claiming responsibility for the civilian killings and warning The Resistance Front not to take credit for them. “The voice is of a known Lashkar terror recruit based in Kulgam, which just proves it is essentially LeT behind the targeted killings, though masquerading as either TRF and now Geelani Force to maintain plausible deniability and project the terror acts as “indigenous” rebellion,” said an officer. A call on arrest of the detained OGWs will be taken based on facts that come out during the course of their questioning. They are likely to be sent to jails outside the Valley, possibly in Jammu or even another state. As part of the counter-terror offensive, which has been stepped up after the killing of seven civilians this month, the agencies have also been able to identify two Pakistani LeT terrorists who delivered the pistols to the local Kashmiris behind the targeted killings. One of the Pakistani terrorists may have infiltrated recently, said a source. The arrests of the OGWs came on a day that NIA conducted searches at seven locations across Kulgam, Srinagar and Baramulla districts of J&K and arrested two operatives of The Resistance Front in a LeT-TRF conspiracy case dating back to June 2021. Sources said around 10 more arrests may follow. The NIA case relates to the recovery of an IED from an LeT terrorist in Bathindi, Jammu, for indulging in terrorist acts in J&K. Earlier, three LeT terrorists were arrested in the case. Investigation has revealed that Pak-based LeT handlers and aides based in J&K had conspired to cause extensive terror activities for harming the public. They had planned that responsibility for the terrorist acts so committed would be taken by TRF to maintain deniability. On Friday, one LeT terrorist said to have been involved in the fatal shooting of Mohammad Shafi Dar on October 2 in Batamaloo was killed in an encounter. General officer commanding of the Army’s 15 Corps, D P Pandey, on Sunday said the killings were part of an agenda to create a rift between different religious communities of J&K. “Over the past year, positive changes have been seen in J&K. These attacks are aimed to induce violence and undo those changes.” He said the people of the Valley would “expose the faces of those who are behind the recent civilian killings”. Strongly condemning the recent attacks on civilians, J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha had on Friday told TOI that the trend of killing ‘soft and easy’ targets shall be dealt with an iron hand, with a revised strategy focused on dismantling the entire terror ecosystem. “We have posted the best police officers across J&K. A strategy review meeting was held on Wednesday and the revised action-plan has been rolled out. Counter-terror action is under way.... We are confident about containing these ‘soft-target’ attacks. We shall not buy peace but instead establish peace. Terror ecosystem has to be dismantled whether here or elsewhere,” Sinha had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cops-detain-430-overground-workers-after-jammu-and-kashmir-killings/articleshow/86924183.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Business||Government to also take over Air India’s unpaid bills of Rs 16,000 crore||NEW DELHI: The new holding company for Air India, which will take over real estate, paintings and other non-core assets of Air India, will also be saddled with piles of unpaid bills from the hemorrhaging national carrier, in addition to loans from banks. These “excess liabilities” being transferred to Air India Asset Holding Company Ltd add up to Rs 15,834 crore — which is more than a quarter of the airline’s total debt, pegged at Rs 61,562 crore at the end of August. So what are these “excess liabilities”? Government sources said these are largely unpaid bills of oil companies, airport operators and other vendors that Air India had managed to avoid paying over the years by virtue of being a wholly-owned government company. The government too has some part in this as it often delays payments, including for tickets purchased for its employees through another public sector company, Balmer Lawrie. “The sale will not just stop the hit that the government has to take on a daily basis but also help clean up the system and release funds,” a government official told TOI. While the liabilities, including loans and unpaid bills, will be taken over by the new entity immediately, it will only be able to monetise the assets over the next few years, depending on the market condition. In the interim, it will have to work out arrangements with banks and other creditors to rework the terms, which the government believes should not be an issue as the government has guaranteed 94% of the loans used to keep the airline afloat, against accumulated losses of nearly Rs 84,000 crore at the end of March. Besides, the terms of the transaction provide for the government to bear the financial impact of Air India operations until the company is transferred to its new owner by the end of December, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-to-also-take-over-ais-unpaid-bills-of-rs-16000-crore/articleshow/86924232.cms||Sidhartha

A total of 1,42,62,375 people have got the first dose and 59,20,035 are vaccinated with both doses. In 2 crore vaccines, around 1000 — 0.005% cases of adverse effects were reported. A total 91% — accounting for 3.10 lakh of health workers have taken the first dose while 85% — accounting for 2.63 lakh have taken the second dose. A total 100% of frontline workers, which account for 3.18 lakh have taken the first and 80% 2.54 lakh have taken the second dose of vaccine. Among citizens beyond age group of 45-plus, a total 84% (58 lakh) people have taken first dose while 53%, which have taken the second dose of vaccine. In the age group of 18 to 44 years of age 61% (77.77 lakh) took first dose and 29% (22.90 lakh) have taken second dose. Considering the positive aspect of high vaccination, health official Dr Subhash Mishra said that vaccination coverage of 2 crore in the state means that we have moved forward in the direction of being safe from corona. The sooner we all apply both the doses, the sooner we will be completely safe from corona disease. The herd immunity can come only through vaccines. Chhattisgarh is receiving sufficient number of vaccines for the last two months. That is, the capacity to vaccinate every day in the state is more than 3 lakh. Now about 1.50 lakh vaccines are being administered daily in the state. Last month for the first time over 45 lakh vaccines have been administered in the state. A target of 100 % single dose has been set in this month. The district lagging behind in vaccinating people at first or second stage are directed to increase the coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/2-crore-jabs-administered-in-state-till-now-health-dept/articleshow/86917039.cms||---

The Centre’s supply principle in the ratio of 75:25 for public and private vaccination will remain applicable for this vaccine as well. ZyCoV-D is going to be introduced in the country’s Covid vaccination programme by October 20. “If there are buyers, up to 25 lakh doses of the ZyCoV-D would be made available to private sector hospitals every month as the initial monthly vaccine availability will be one crore doses,” NK Arora, chairman of the Centre’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) told TOI on Sunday. The needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Zydus Cadila, has received emergency use authorisation for being administered to children between 12 and 17 years of age in India. The three-dose vaccine is to be given with a 28-day gap between each dose. “The biggest hurdle with this vaccine is its slow production. Initially, the manufacturer can only make available one crore doses every month,” Arora said. He, however, added that the private sector had not shown much interest in vaccine purchases after the new guidelines about Covid-19 vaccine supply in the ratio of 75:25 came into effect. Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Hospital in Pune, said: “It is a three-dose vaccine, hence the vaccination cost is likely to be high, which may negatively impact purchase in the private sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kids-vaccine-zycov-d-to-be-given-to-private-hospitals-too/articleshow/86924445.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka minister K Sudhakar blames ‘modern’ women for vanishing joint families in India||BENGALURU: In remarks that shocked an audience comprising eminent mental healthcare experts, among others, Karnataka health and family welfare minister K Sudhakar on Sunday regretted the “choices” of modern Indian women while referring to disappearing joint families and “Indians unfortunately going the western way”. “Sorry to say this. Today, a lot of modern women in India want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don’t want to give birth; they want surrogacy,” Sudhakar said while adressing a World Mental Health Day event at Nimhans. The minister elaborated about India’s contribution of Yoga, meditation and pranayama to the world. “Our ancestors taught the world 100 years ago. Unfortunately, today, we are going the western way. We don’t want our parents living with us, forget about grandparents,” he said. The minister said that about 30 minutes of walking every morning could help release good hormones and make a person feel good. “Covid and mental health can’t be separated,” the minister said, adding that during the beginning of the pandemic, the health department started tele-counselling for Covid patients, as suggested by experts in Nimhans. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the need was to remove the stigma attached to mental health issues. He said mental health, like diabetes, is a silent killer. “While diabetes becomes fatal because it often goes undetected, people with mental health do not come forward because of stigma.” Mandaviya said more research from institutes like Nimhans needs to be done for taking policy decisions in the coming days. The Karnataka minister’s words about the “choices” of modern women came as a shocker to the audience, mainly from the faculty of the national institute of importance. “It was an awful comment,” said a senior professor from Nimhans. “It cannot be dismissed as his individual comment when said in an open forum like the World Mental Health Day event,” a faculty member from Nimhans told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/modern-indian-women-dont-want-to-give-birth-minister/articleshow/86924528.cms||---
---||India||States warn of power cuts as plants face coal crunch||AMARAVATI/BENGALURU/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Facing a severe power crisis due to shortage of coal, many southern states have warned of massive load-shedding and asked Centre for release of coal blocks. While Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was the first to highlight the coal crisis in thermal power stations in the country when he sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention recently, Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai said on Sunday that he has urged the Centre to fast-track clearances for two coal blocks allotted to Karnataka so that a power crisis linked to a coal shortage could be averted. In Kerala, electricity minister K Krishnankutty on Sunday warned that the state would have to impose load shedding if the crisis caused by shortage of coal-based power generation continues. In what could lead to an alarming situation, thermal generation in AP is supplementing just around 20 per cent of the total power requirement and discoms are gearing up for sudden power outages due to the shortage in supplies from generation centres. All the thermal power plants put together are producing around 40 million units against the state’s total consumption of 190 million units. Meanwhile, Central Power Distribution Company Limited (CPDCL) issued cautionary note to power consumers to maintain self-restraint in using power gadgets. The CPDCL urged consumers to be judicious in using power utilities keeping in view of the dipping power generation from thermal plants. Meanwhile, Karnataka has been focussing on securing coal blocks and supplies because of concerns over existing stocks. Three major thermal power stations in the state have reserves that are expected to last for 48 hours, officials said on Sunday. The Centre has allotted Karnataka a coal block near Chandrapur in Maharashtra and another in Mahanadi, Odisha. Bommai has requested Union minister for environment and forest Bhupendra Yadav to give the required approvals at the earliest. In Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala electricity minister K Krishnankutty said: “The shortage of coal has affected power generation in the country and the power crisis is expected to continue for nearly six months. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is monitoring the situation and people should cooperate with reduced use of power, especially during the peak hours.” The state has been experiencing a shortage of 15% power from the central pool for the past few days following the closure of four thermal stations due to coal shortage. "There is a shortage of 1,000 MW power from the central pool. On Saturday, we received only 30% of our daily quota from Koodankulam. If the situation continues like this for a long period, we will have to impose power cuts," the minister said. Coal dispatch ramped up: CILRanchi: The subsidiary companies of Coal India Limited (CIL) operating in Jharkhand on Sunday said that their production and dispatch have been ramped up in the recent days to meet the needs of the power sector. The seven subsidiary companies of CIL have dispatched 15.66 lakh tonnes of coal each day to its consumers during the month of October. On Saturday, the CIL dispatched 17.11 lakh tonne coal through roadways and railway rakes. Of the total, 14.14 lakh tonne coal was dispatched to the power sector. “We are on the right track. In another 10-15 days, our coal supply will get bette,” CCL’s chairman-cum-managing director PM Prasad told TOI on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-warn-of-power-cuts-as-plants-face-coal-crunch/articleshow/86924550.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma puts scheme onus on all MLAs||GUWAHATI: Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has put the onus on all MLAs from the BJP-led coalition — BJP, AGP and UPPL — to focus on timely implementation of each and every government project in their respective constituencies. MPs from Assam, representing the NDA, also attended a crucial meeting chaired by the CM here on Sunday. This is the first of its kind meeting chaired by Sarma. The marathon closed-door meeting that started at around 9 am on Sunday and contined till late in the evening, focusing on choosing the right beneficiaries for the government schemes and ending illegal broking activities. Speaking to the media, cabinet minister Pijush Hazarika said, “Apart from the MLAs, the chiefs of the political parties of our alliance have been invited. The thrust has been to send the MLAs to the villages and their constituencies to keep a close watch on the implementation of the schemes.” While legislators from the NDA fold were invited to Sunday’s meeting, Hazarika said in the next rounds, the MLAs of opposition parties will also be invited. The MLAs were apprised of various central government schemes like PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana as well as ambitious state government schemes like Orunodoi, meant for needy families where women are primary caretakers. The public works department, health and sports departments’ schemes were also brought to the notice of the MLAs so that they can implement those for the benefits for the residents of their constituencies. “It’s a kind of orientation programme in order to ensure that the schemes are properly implemented on the ground,” Hazarika said. Some of the senior officials of a few departments also attended the meeting to apprise the ministers of the ways in which the schemes are being implemented. The first five months of the Himanta Biswa Sarma government has seen several anti-corruption drives against government officials. The state government also cracked the whip on land brokers in a latest move to cleanse the revenue offices of corrupt practices. About 500 land brokers were arrested from various parts of the state a few weeks ago. Though this reflected the tough stance of the government against “dalal raj”, it was also clear that corrupt practices were going on in the BJP regime. “The last five months and an overview of the five-year planning have been discussed. A major thrust has been laid on making the government schemes free from the influence of middlemen,” said an insider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/sarma-puts-scheme-onus-on-all-mlas/articleshow/86921238.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Delhi||A first in India: Transplanted liver reused in Delhi, saves life||NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind operation in India, doctors at a private hospital in the city reused a liver, transplanted onto a patient who was declared brain dead days after the operation, to save another man’s life. The new recipient, a 54-year-old man from Delhi, is stable and recuperating well, said Dr Subhash Gupta, chairman of the Centre for Liver and Biliary Sciences at Max Saket. “Only a few such transplants had earlier been done globally, none in India ,” he added. The first recipient of the organ had suffered intracranial haemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain, barely a week after the transplant. He was declared brain dead on October 5. All but 1 of 21 patients refused ‘used liver’ for transplant op According to Max hospital doctors, the liver belonged to a 44-year-old woman from Gurgaon who had a history of seizures and hypertension, who was declared brain dead following a brain bleed at Fortis Gurgaon on September 21. The woman’s family consented to donate her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas. The 44-year-old’s liver was transplanted into a 53-year-old man from Gurgaon who was suffering from liver failure. The recipient was recovering well post-transplant, but he also developed the same problem as his donor — brain bleed (intracranial haemorrhage) on September 28, after about a week of the liver transplant operation. After taking the opinion of a neurologist, he was declared brain dead on October 5 at about 9.40pm. The family of the 53-year-old insisted that his organs, including the liver, be used to save other lives, following which the National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) was informed. An alert was sent out by NOTTO to all hospitals that had the facility for liver transplantation about the availability of a previously transplanted liver, Dr Gupta said, adding that none of the hospitals came forward to accept the reused liver. “We at Max hospital Saket had about 21 patients waiting for the liver in the same blood group. We contacted all of them. All, but one patient, refused to get the transplant from this liver,” the transplant coordinator at Max Saket said. There is a high risk of rejection in transplant involving a liver that has been used before. Dr Gupta said this was explained in detail to the new recipient, a 54-year-old man from Delhi, but he still wanted to go ahead. Several precautions were taken to assess the risk of rejection prior to transplant, the doctor said. “First, we checked the quality of the liver by looking at the liver function tests. To our surprise, these tests were pristine. Then, we confirmed that there had been no break in the immunosuppressive therapy after the onset of intracranial bleeding whilst the now recipient-turned-donor had been on the ventilator in the ICU. The coordinators confirmed that no rejection episode had occurred after the transplant and the intracranial bleed was unrelated to the transplant process. This information was obtained by carefully studying the post-transplant medical records,” he said. The liver transplant using the previously transplanted organ was carried out on October 6. According to the doctors, the first few days are critical for the overall success of the transplant. “Luckily, soon after the surgery, the patient came off the ventilator with mental faculties completely intact. The liver enzymes did go very high, but with infusion of N-acetyl cysteine, we were able to control it. There is a possibility that a severe rejection episode may happen in the next few days. We are prepared to deal with it as all lines and tubes have been removed so that infection does not flare up with increased immunosuppressive therapy,” Dr Gupta said. The doctor said his team would also be on the lookout for any intracranial bleed. “Blood pressure will be kept under control and no antiplatelet agent will be used,” he said. The success of this transplant opens another door for those waiting for organ transplants, the doctor said. Many organ recipients die from post-transplant cardiovascular events and not from failing grafts. While every effort must be made to prevent this, should such an event happen, these organs can be used again, Dr Gupta added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-but-1-of-21-patients-refused-used-liver/articleshow/86924587.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||India||PM listens to everyone, doesn’t impose decisions, says Amit Shah||NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said a section who have been opposed to BJP’s ideology have deliberately distorted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image by painting him as authoritarian, and stressed that the latter listens to everyone and does not impose his views. “It’s very unfortunate... Certain people who are opposed to our ideology keep distorting facts and make a concerted bid to hurt the image of Modi ji. The fact is that he is a patient listener and speaks the least, irrespective of the nature of the meeting,” the home minister said in an interview in which he said he considers himself “fortunate” to have worked closely with Modi, first in Gujarat and now at the Centre. Shah made light of what he called the caricature of the Prime Minister, saying that the opposition’s attempt to play it up has only made the PM stronger because he has a standing among people. “After every opposition, Modi emerges stronger, his will power becomes stronger because support of the people lies with him. Support of the people is rock solid with Modi ji. In democracy, there cannot be a bigger achievement,” Shah said in an exclusive interview with the newly-launched Sansad TV. “He listens to everyone patiently... he is a listener. Sometimes even I often wonder why should be there so much deliberation. However, Modi ji takes decisions patiently and heeds to suggestions on merit and not according to the stature of the individual,” Shah said. “There is not an iota of truth that Modi imposes decisions... It is not correct at all. People who have worked under him, some of whom may be a few critics too, will admit that deliberations of Union cabinet have never been as democratic as under Modi Ji. I have not seen a listener like him,” Shah said. He added that people don’t get to know about the democatic deliberations in the Union cabinet since Modi is a disciplinarian and ensures that what transpires in meetings of the cabinet does not spill over into public. “The PM believes in discipline... He believes that internal discussions should not come out. There was a time when it used to come out and it used to be useful for some. It does not happen any more. Media are often caught unaware and, hence, decisions which have been taken after exhaustive deliberations are projected as Modi ji’s calls. The reality is that the pros and cons are deliberated in detail and people have been heard out,” Shah said. “Of course, he is the PM and the ultimate decision-making authority, but each decision is deliberated,” he added. On why the PM takes decisions fraught with political risks, the home minister said it is becaue of his belief that he should use his term to transform the country. “Our aim is to transform the country... to fetch a respectable position for the country of 130 crore citizens globally, which is due for several years,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-listens-to-everyone-doesnt-impose-decisions-says-amit-shah/articleshow/86924650.cms||Akhilesh Singh

Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL), on Sunday acquired 100% shareholding of REC Solar Holdings AS (REC Group) from China National Bluestar (Group) Co, for an Enterprise Value of $771 million (Rs 5,800 crore). Simultaneously, RNESL also executed definitive agreements with Shapoorji Pallonji and Company (SPCPL), Khurshed Daruvala and Sterling & Wilson Solar (SWSL) to acquire 40% stake post-money in SWSL through a series of transactions. These transactions include a 15.9% preferential allotment, purchase of 9.7% stake from the promoters and an open offer for 26%. Altogether, the transactions could entail total investment of up to Rs 3,900 crore, depending on the price at which the open offer is made. These are the first steps in green energy by the oil-to-retail and telecom giant. While they may not match the recent Adani Green Energy’s acquisition of SoftBank-promoted SB Energy for $3.5 billion, they indicate RNESL’s ambitions to establish a dominant position in the global green energy arena. The acquisition of REC Solar will help Reliance expand in the US, Europe, Australia and elsewhere in Asia. The 40% stake in Sterling & Wilson Solar will provide Reliance the capability to execute clean energy projects globally. With 11-plus GW of solar turnkey projects executed globally and more than five decades of engineering experience, SWSL is a leading international EPC and O&M service provider in the renewables sector. The company has a 3,000 strong team and presence across 24 countries. REC manufactures solar grade polysilicon as well as solar panel and modules at facilities in Norway and Singapore. It has more than 1,300 employees globally, Reliance Industries said in a statement. Reliance said it will use REC’s technology to manufacture metallic silicon and solar panels at its proposed gigafactory at Jamnagar in Gujarat with initial annual capacity of 4 GW (gigawatts), which will be raised to 10GW. The acquisition of REC Solar is part of $2-billion — out of the $10-billion renewables plan — Ambani had earmarked for acquisitions to create clean energy capabilities. “It is in line with our strategy of investing in new and advanced technologies and operating capabilities aimed at achieving Reliance’s goal of enabling 100GW clean and green energy before the end of this decade,” the statement quoted Ambani as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-boosts-solar-business-with-rs-9k-crore-deals/articleshow/86925023.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Such messages qualify as acts of irresponsible behaviour…. Neither there was, nor there is, any crisis. It was created unnecessarily,” he said after meeting executives of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (TPDDL), Reliance Infrastructure discoms BRPL and BYPL as well as Delhi power department officials at his residence. The coal ministry also issued a statement trashing apprehensions of supply disruption. “Assuring everyone that there is absolutely no threat of disruption in power supply. There is sufficient coal stock of 43 million tonnes with Coal India, equivalent to 24 days of demand. The coal stock at power plants is about 72 lakh tonnes, sufficient for four days’ requirement,” coal minister Prahlad Joshi tweeted. A major factor contributing to the situation is a 30% reduction in supply by imported coal-fired plants under PPAs due to high international prices of coal, while domestic coal-based power supply has gone up nearly 24% in the first half. The imported coal-based power plants have generated about 25.6 billion units against a programme of 45.7 billion units. Singh told Delhi discoms they will get as much power as they want. State-run NTPC and DVC have been directed to make their capacity available as per the requirement of discoms. NTPC has also been told to offer normative declared capacity to Delhi’s discoms as per their allocations from gas-based power plants under respective PPAs (power purchase agreements). The power minister also asked gas utility GAIL to ensure fuel supply to Bawana and Pragati plants from all sources. Oil ministry sources said GAIL is supplying 1.56 million cubic metres of gas per day as peer allocation. On Saturday, TPDDL chief executive Ganesh Srinivasan had warned of intermittent blackouts due to coal shortage. The company also sent SMS asking its customers to use power “judiciously” in view of “critical” supply situations between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Later, the company admitted it had shut its imported coal-fired power plant because the recent spike in international coal prices made operations “unviable”. BSES discoms did not comment either way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rk-singh-reads-the-riot-act-to-tata-power-on-blackout-bogey/articleshow/86925132.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Bhubaneswar||Body of journalist’s son fished out from pond in Patrapada||BHUBANESWAR: A senior journalist’s son, who was allegedly kidnapped by unknown persons from Infocity area here on Saturday night, was found dead in a pond in Patrapada on Sunday. The deceased was identified as Manish Anurag Das (30), who was set to marry next month. Police said they would probe from all possible angles, including the suspected murder as the deceased’s father Navin Das strongly suspected his son might have been killed by the kidnappers. Sources said Manish was a businessman and had been looking after his father’s tabloid. Mystery shrouded the cause and circumstances that led to his death. Police said Manish had called up his parents on Saturday evening and told them about his dinner plan with some friends at a restaurant in Patia. As his parents were waiting for his return, they were shocked to receive his distress call past midnight where he said he was beaten up and kidnapped by some persons in Patia area. Around 4.10 am on Sunday, he again called his parents and reportedly demanded a small ransom money (a few thousands of rupees) for his release. His mother reportedly transferred around Rs 7,000 to his account. The family later lodged a complaint with the Infocity police station about his abduction. After a few hours, the police found the body of a man floating in a pond in Patrapada and identified him as Manish. The distance between the abduction site and pond is around 15 km. Police are at a loss as to how Manish came to the Patrapada pond from Patia and whether his death was accidental or by murder. “We are trying to find out the exact cause of death. No injury marks were found on the body. A kidnapping case was registered at Infocity police station. Since his family suspects foul play behind his death, we will probe the murder angle. A special team has been formed to solve the case,” DCP Uma Shankar Dash said. Police said they would verify the call records of Manish’s phone, question his friends and examine the CCTV footage in Patia to get some clues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/body-of-journalists-son-fished-out-from-pond-in-patrapada/articleshow/86916203.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Moreover, the statement of Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Rameswar Teli that free Covid-19 vaccines have resulted in the hike of petrol and diesel prices in the country has sparked severe criticism from the opposition and public. The price of petrol had already crossed the 100-rupee mark in a number of districts in the state. According to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers, petrol price was increased by 92 paise per litre since Thursday and in Guwahati, petrol now costs Rs 100.07 a litre. Speaking on the sidelines of the BJP district executive meeting at Tinsukia district of Assam, Teli on Saturday said that the administration of free Covid-19 vaccines is to be blamed for the rise in prices of petrol and diesel. “From where the money will come for free vaccines...undoubtedly the prices of petrol, diesel will rise. You didn't pay for the vaccine. Money collected in taxes on petrol and diesel is being used to procure vaccines for all,” Teli had said. The Opposition Congress and AIUDF slammed the minister’s “unfortunate” statement for linking rise in fuel prices to free supply of Covid vaccine. “So on one hand you take pride in saying that you are giving free Covid vaccines to the people of India and on the other, you say that you are raising petrol prices in order to give free Covid vaccines! What kind of logic is that? So that means the Covid vaccines are actually not free. People are paying for it indirectly. And as it is, the vaccine is not free for everyone,” Congress spokesperson Bobbeeta Sarma said. She said several times when international crude oil price had gone down, but people of India never got the benefit of the slashed rates. “While the minister says cost of vaccine is being recovered from through fuel price hike, his government shamelessly takes credit for free supply of vaccines,” AIUDF spokesperson Rafiqul Islam said. Taking a dig at Narendra Modi’s 2014 poll pitch of “acchhe din aayenge” (good days are coming), city resident Nabita Das said, “Only bad days have arrived. The price of all kinds of essential commodities has shot up. We have to walk now instead of riding a bike due to fuel hike,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/petrol-price-crosses-100-in-guwahati-triggers-outrage/articleshow/86920703.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

Both Tynsong and Hazarika told the people living along the boundary that they were only on an inspection and they would be submitting reports to their respective chief ministers and that a decision will only be taken at the level of “highest authorities”, meaning the chief ministers of the two neighbouring states. The duo led the cabinet-level committees of their respective states for an inspection at Mawiong, Barapathar, Pillangkata A, B, Maikhuli, Patharkuchi, Pahamkinshoh and Khanapara villages. They also informed that the visit was decided after the meeting of both the regional committees held recently at Vivanta Taj Hotel in Guwahati, where documentations of these lands were verified. A meeting was also held at Ratacherra, East Jaintia Hills district, between officials of both the states led by Meghalaya cabinet minister Sñiawbhalang Dhar and Assam cabinet minister Chandra Mohan Patowary to discuss the boundary dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/meghalaya-and-assam-ministers-inspect-inter-state-boundary/articleshow/86920721.cms||Manosh Das

A latest order issued by the state education stated that for students of classes I to VIII, hostels will reopen from November 1 while classes IX and XI students have been allowed to enter hostels from October 19. Final-year students of undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) classes are already staying in hostels. Sources in the education department said before November 1, students from the rest of the UG and PG classes will also be able to join their hostels. “Due to improved Covid-19 situation, the government of Assam, after due consideration of all parameters, is pleased to notify that the hostels in residential schools/day boarding schools are allowed to function for class IX and XI w.e.f 19/10/2021 and from class I to VIII w.e.f 1 st November, 2021,” read the order. It further cautioned that all protocols of safety guidelines in view of Covid-19 must be strictly followed. Though physical classes for the elementary level (I to VIII) will resume on October 19, reopening of hostels has been slightly delayed to keep a watch on the situation. In the elementary classes, around 50 lakh students are enrolled across Assam. It is going to be a huge exercise to monitor safe movement of the kids who remain unvaccinated. “It’s a wait-and-watch move. After reopening of the campuses we will slowly open the hostels. It’s going to be a swift transition,” principal secretary of state education department, B Kalyan Chakravarthy, told TOI on Sunday. Even as only a few districts in Assam have a positivity rate above 1%, education department officials are hopeful that both hostels and offline classes will begin smoothly. “We want special government observation in the hostels as the schoolchildren might not remember to maintain social distancing,” said Assam State Primary Teachers’ Association (ASPTA) general secretary, Ratul Chandra Goswami. The education department, however, has clarified that in case in any district the positivity rate goes above 2% on a particular day, the DC of the district concerned, in consultation with the mission director, National Health Mission, Assam, will close down the educational institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/states-residential-school-hostels-to-reopen-on-nov-1/articleshow/86920716.cms||---

Sanjay, who was a member of Tej’s newly floated Chhatra Janshakti Parishad (CJP) and filed his nomination papers to contest as an independent candidate from Tarapur, also took the membership of RJD in the presence of Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi. Earlier, Sanjay had announced that Tej will be campaigning for him in the byelection. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Sanjay took this decision as the residents of Tarapur wanted the RJD to win. “He could sense the feeling of common people and decided to withdraw from the bypoll,” said Gagan Taking to Twitter, Tej Pratap criticized Tejashwi’s political advisor for all these developments. Calling Tejashwi’s advisor Sanjay Yadav as “Haryanawi script writer”, Tej said he had been writing the script of a ‘C’ grade movie. Tej also denied his role in backing Sanjay to contest from Tarapur. The RJD gave another blow to Tej by making Srijan Swaraj as the party’s youth wing vice-president. Srijan, once a close aide of Tej, had to face his ire, too. Tej had removed Srijan from the post of Chhatra RJD president and given the charge to Akash Yadav. Later, RJD state president Jagadanand Singh removed Akash from the post, leading to an open rift in Lalu’s family and tej Pratap forming his own CJP. Speculations are rife that Tej may campaign for the Congress candidate against the RJD official nominee from Kusheshwarsthan in the assembly byelction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-suffers-jolt-as-aide-joins-hands-with-tejas/articleshow/86918493.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The deceased were identified as Umesh Bind (45), his wife Kari Devi (42) and their neighbour Kaushmi Devi (33). SHO Nikhil Singh said the three were going to cut grass for cattle when they came in contact with a live wire laid by a farmer to supply power to pumping set for irrigating his field. Singh said some villagers present around disconnected the power supply and rushed them to hospital, where doctors declared them dead. The SHO said the bodies were handed over to the respective family members after cremation. “Necessary financial assistance has been given to the grieving families for cremation. Authorities will take a call on ex gratia payment after investigation,” he said.

The police vehicles invited a few curious stares as the cops escorted a man to the first floor of the G tower. But as more policemen and an entourage of media reached there, the residents came out on their balconies and peeped outside their windows with several questions on their faces. Soon, they realized that their quiet and sleepy complex was at the centre of an investigation that had been making headlines since Saturday morning. The dead body of Mahendi alias Heena Pethani was found in a decomposed state in G-102 apartment. Pathani is mother of the one-year-old boy who was abandoned at Swaminarayan Gaushala in Gandhinagar. Pethani was living at this rented apartment with her married lover Sachin Dixit and their over one-year-old son Shivansh for the last few months. The other residents of the complex knew the couple as somebody who would keep to themselves. In the span of the last two to three months, the couple had not mingled even with their immediate neighbour. For the last three days, the complex was in a festive mood, but no one would have thought in their wildest dreams that a woman was murdered there and her body had been packed in the apartment. “There was no stench at all. In fact, on Saturday night police had come to the complex to make us wind up the celebrations as it was too late, but they too did not find anything suspicious,” said a resident named Amit. He added that the couple would be seen at night when they used to take a walk within the complex. “We used to hear the child’s crying, but never heard any loud noise of fighting or anything suspicious,” said their immediate neighbour Amita Tiwari. While none of the residents could sense any stench for the last two to three days, on Sunday, within minutes of police opening the apartment the stench of the decomposed body spread throughout the complex forcing the curious residents to close the doors and windows of their houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/couple-always-kept-to-themselves-say-neighbours/articleshow/86920424.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Puja is facilitated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself, who visited the home on Sunday and oversaw the preparations. She left only after cautioning the residents to stay safe and enjoy the festival. “I think this will be the best puja for me. Even when I was at home with my children and husband, I never had so much fun. This is like having a puja at my own home. I have no time to even sit and relax. There is so much work — cutting up fruits, decorating the pandal with flowers, choosing songs and other chores,” said Gita Chatterjee, who has been living here for the past eight years. A regular visitor to this old-age home for years, the chief minister came to Navanir with minister Firhad Hakim and MLA Indranil Sen on Sunday, and brought a large quantity of Puja gifts, including sweets and clothes, for the elderly residents. “This place is extremely close to my heart. I have been coming here since I was an MP from Jadavpur. There is a separate attraction in this place. I am also thankful to you that you all went and voted in the last by-election amidst this pandemic. I pray that you all have a healthy life,” Banerjee said. The CM’s voice was choked, which she blamed on a slight cough-and-cold she has contracted while inaugurating pujas in the rain. Banerjee also invited all the residents to visit her home in Kalighat during Kali Puja — another ritual that she has been following since she became the chief minister in 2011. However, due to rise in Covid, she had avoided the practice last year. “If everything is fine, I will again take you all to my home during this Kali Puja,” the CM said. Speaking to TOI, Sarmistha Biswas,in charge of the old-age home, said that in the earlier years, multiple organisations used to take the residents on Puja parikrama and sent goodies and gifts during the festive period. However, the pandemic has put a stop to everything. “Last year, when the chief minister visited us, she found the residents morose because of the pandemic restrictions. She immediately instructed her party colleagues to organise a puja on the premises and, within a day, a pandal and an idol were delivered. We had a great time. This time, the celebration is sweeter than ever,” said Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-visits-old-age-home-with-festive-gifts-as-residents-prepare-for-a-puja-of-their-own/articleshow/86921008.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The cyber frauds, who cheated several job aspirants from across the country, were arrested from a house at Bharaopar locality under Laheri police station area, Biharsharif Sadar SDPO Shibli Nomani, who led the raid, said. Those arrested were identified as Pintu Kumar and Laxman Kumar, both residents of Katrisarai, Mukesh Kumar of Giriak, Gautam Kumar of Sheikhopursarai in Sheikhpura district and Kishore Kumar of Pakribarawan in neighbouring Nawada district. Nomani said police recovered 23 cellphones, 4 ATM cards, Rs30,000 in cash and other incriminating documents from their possession. He said preliminary interrogation revealed that they cheated a number job aspirants of lakhs of rupees across the country by creating false websites of existing and non-existing companies and invited applications for recruitments at different positions. Katrisarai, once notorious for being a hub of fake aphrodisiac medicines, has become a centre of cyber frauds. Sources said several people in over 40 villages of Katrisarai block and neighbouring Nawada and Sheikhpura districts are engaged in cybercrime. One Gautam Kumar was also arrested with 2 countrymade pistols and 14 live cartridges from Kharuara under Chero police station area. Juvenile acquitted: The Juvenile Justice Board principal judge, Manvendra Mishra, on Friday acquitted a mentally and physically infirm juvenile, who was booked under Section 448 (house trespass), 380 (theft) and 511 (moral guilt or injury) of the IPC recently. Defence lawyer Kanchan Kumar said the juvenile from Islampur police station area had entered the house of a neighbour just to drink tap water when he had been caught by the complainant suspecting him to be a thief. The social background report of the juvenile prepared and submitted by child welfare police officer (CWPO) stated that he is one among the eight siblings of a daily wager is under treatment of a local doctor. The CWPO also noted that the CCTV camera installed inside the house of the complainant didn’t show the accused touching any article kept there. Advocate Kanchan Kumar said the judge pulled up the local police for violating Section 8 of the Juvenile Justice Act (JJA)2017, which restricts police from lodging an FIR against a minor offender of any crime if no adult was involved in it.

In a programme held on Sunday, judges of the high court and members of the bar felicitated the outgoing chief justice. Speaking on the occasion, Justice Goswami thanked everyone for extending cooperation to him. Drawing parallels between cricket and the legal profession, he said the legal profession requires temperament and patience, similar to that of a test cricketer playing a long innings. Justice Goswami observed that many people are deprived of their rights due to a lack of awareness. He said young lawyers should take the lead in making people aware of their rights and fight for the cause of the downtrodden and the marginalised. Advocate general S Sriram lauded the efforts of Justice Goswami to provide equal opportunities to everyone and his guidance to law officers, government officials and the government. Earlier in the day, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah was sworn in as judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court.

The NHRC has directed the state government to file a factual report as well as an action taken report in four weeks’ time on the issue in the backdrop of Bipin Agrawal’s murder on September 24. The NHRC considers that the state government’s alleged failure to follow Union Ministry of Home Affairs' guidelines to provide protection to RTI activists is a human rights violation of the nature of inaction of the government authorities. The notice dated October 8 has been issued on a complaint lodged by Supreme Court lawyer Brajesh Singh after Agrawal’s murder. Singh alleged that RTI activists had been murdered earlier also as the government failed to provide them security cover. He also mentioned about the MHA guidelines for giving protection to RTI activists. Agrawal was shot dead at the Harsiddhi block office gate in East Champaran. Four persons, including a former block head of Harsiddhi and a journalist, have been arrested in the case while several businessmen as well a district level politician are suspected to be involved in his murder. As per RTI activist Shree Prakash Rai, at least 20 RTI activists have been murdered in Bihar since 2010, including 10 since 2018. East Champaran SP Naveen Kumar Jha had said Agrawal was killed for his RTI works leading to anti-encroachment drive at Harsiddhi. Several plots of government land were encroached upon by businessmen and politicians. On June 14, 2013, the MHA had sent an advisory to chief secretaries of states and UTs for providing adequate security to the RTI activists. The MHA had also requested states/UTs to consider the recommendations and suggestions of the task force set up by the Centre’s Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) regarding ensuring the security of RTI activists. The task force was also for reviewing provisions in the RTI Act, 2005, and to recommend measures for its better implementation and enforcement besides suggesting measures for protection of persons seeking information under the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nhrc-seeks-atr-on-security-cover-to-rti-activists/articleshow/86918658.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||Chandrababu Naidu making ‘baseless’ claims against AP CM: Minister||AMARAVATI: Civil supplies minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani) on Sunday advised TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu to close operations of his party and merge it with Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena as it would be “difficult for Naidu to revive the party.” He criticised Kalyan for promising to work for the Kamma community instead of the weaker sections of society and added the Jana Sena chief has exposed that he is interested only in business and minting money from politics. Speaking to reporters at the party office, Nani said Naidu is making baseless allegations against chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy as he has realised it would be difficult to revive the party under Nara Lokesh’s leadership. “Since Naidu and his coterie have realised that neither the party supremo nor Lokesh could compete against Jagan, they are pushing Kalyan into the battlefield. In fact, Kalyan himself had lost both the seats he contested and has now run away from Badvel,” Nani said. The minister charged that Naidu ruined the state’s finances during the tenure of the TDP-led government. “Naidu is chiefly responsible for the state’s troubles,” the minister added. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is committed to fulfilling the promises made to the self-help groups and started extending financial assistance under YSR Aasara. Naidu duped women self-help groups after coming to power and pushed them into a debt trap,” Nani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/naidu-making-baseless-claims-against-cm-min/articleshow/86919118.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Durga Puja festival promotes brotherhood||PATNA: The Durga Puja festival is a great social leveller. By bringing people from different social strata and communities closer, the festival promotes the feeling of fraternity and brotherhood. In Patna, several Muslim youths and businessmen join hands with their Hindu brothers in the Durga Puja celebrations. While many of them donate funds liberally for the celebrations on a grand scale, others help the organizers physically in cleaning the puja site and erecting and decorating stalls. According to a conservative estimate, more than 500 Muslim artisans are giving finishing touches to the replicas of famous Hindu temples and palaces crafted for the Puja in Patna and other cities in Nalanda, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Purnia, Bhagalpur and Madhubani districts. Some of these artisans have been hired from Jharkhand and West Bengal. Prabuddh Biswas, who has been taking active interest in Durga Puja activities in the city for the last several decades, says the Puja celebrations involve people from all castes and communities as puja can’t be held on a grand scale by the people of any particular caste or community. Right from erecting attractive pandals to decorating the stage, lighting the entire area, preparing dresses for the Goddess and preparing ‘bhog’ and ‘prasad’, all require the help of people from different communities. A large section of the Muslim population of Patna City area enthusiastically participates in the Puja celebrations at Badi Patan Devi and Chhoti Patan Devi temples. The immersion of the idols of Durga in the city starts with that from Badi Patan Devi. And, at the time of the departure of the Goddess from the pandal, a huge gathering of devotees consisting people of different faiths can be seen, adds Biswas. Retired teacher J K Khan points out that the feeling of communal harmony seems more pronounced in rural areas as a number of Muslims, particularly those having some kind of ‘mannat’, worship Durga with full devotion. Right from ‘sashthi’ to ‘dashmi’, they refrain from eating non-vegetarian food. On the other hand, many Hindus also participate in festivals like Eid, Bakrid and Muharram with equal enthusiasm, he adds. Patna University ancient Indian history and archaeology department’s former head Jayadeo Mishra observes that the very purpose of organizing community festivals is to promote the feeling of social harmony. The people of all sections of the society, rich as well as poor, have been coming together right from ancient times to celebrate this festival with gaiety and fervour. Earlier, up to a few decades back, the city used to invite a large number of music maestros from different parts of the country to perform during Puja celebrations and these artists used to belong to different communities. The Durga puja festival also stands for women’s empowerment, he asserts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/durga-puja-festival-promotes-brotherhood/articleshow/86918733.cms||B K Mishra

They were also into drug peddling racket. Golu used to drive bikes during loot and snatching as he was expert in driving even in traffic jams,” he said. He said the recoveries were made from a house near Lal Mandir. He said the gang has seven members. Five are evading arrest. Sachivalaya ASP Kamya Mishra said police got to know about the gang while investigating a handbag loot from an autorickshaw. "Police are tracing the owners of recovered cellphones. Golu and Rajkumar’s criminal antecedents are also being looking into," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-held-14-packets-of-brown-sugar-34-phones-seized/articleshow/86918610.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Assembly bypoll results will decide grand alliance fate in Bihar: Congress||PATNA: The Congress state in-charge, Bhakta Charan Das, on Sunday accused RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of not following the alliance dharma in the byelection for the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats in Bihar. He also said the bypoll results will decide the future of grand alliance (GA) in Bihar. Congress wanted to contest from Kusheshwar Asthan like in the 2020 polls when the party had got it under the seat-sharing formula of GA led by RJD. But RJD is contesting from both the seats and Congress, in retaliation, has also fielded its candidates in both the constituencies for the byelection to be held on October 30. Das, who reached Patna on Sunday to discuss the bypoll strategy with party leaders, said the Congress had told Tejashwi about its strength in Kusheshwar Asthan. “He (Tejashwi) had said our candidate will not win. But I tried to make him understand and even informed him that our team will visit the constituency and do an assessment. We even formed a team, but he (Tejashwi) declared his candidate,” said Das, adding that the Congress will fighting the bypolls firmly. “Our win on one seat would have been RJD’s gain. So what was the reason to make us weak,” Das said and reaffirmed that the fight between Congress and RJD in both the seats was not friendly. Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre further said since the RJD and Congress are fighting against one another in the bypolls, how could the two be called alliance partners. Later on, Das even formed a 51-member committee to work for the bypolls. Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said this jumbo team will ensure that Congress candidates win the bypolls. Meanwhile, Bihar Congress members will stage a silent protest near Income Tax roundabout on Monday against the Lakhimpur Kheri killings. Das, along with state leaders and party members, will be present there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/assembly-bypoll-results-will-decide-ga-fate-in-state-cong/articleshow/86918382.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Nagpur||FDCM wants 287sq km lush forests in lieu of Kanhargaon||Nagpur: At a time when forests are necessary for ecological security and to fight climate change, forest department’s move to grant 287 square kilometre (sq km) high-quality forests — equivalent to the area occupied by 26 Navegaon Bandh lakes — to the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) has come in for sharp criticism from greens. On Friday, principal chief conservator of forests, head of forest force (PCCF (HoFF)) G Saiprakash held a meeting in Chandrapur to discuss the issue with officials concerned, who were asked to identify reserve forest patches adjoining the existing FDCM area in the district. The area is being demanded in lieu of 256 sq km area diverted for Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary. Sources said the HoFF had sought a report about the proposed area for FDCM, which would be at least 10km from Kanhargaon. They were asked to identify some compartments in the Ballarshah range. FDCM has identified a little over 287 sq km spread across 134 compartments. Of this, 30 sq km area (19 compartments) is in Dhaba range under Central Chanda division in Chandrapur, and 257sq km (115 compartments) in Allapalli division under Gadchiroli circle. Chandrapur officials are already opposed to diverting the Dhaba area to FDCM. If 30 sq km of the 53 sq km Dhaba range is transferred, the range will shrink to a mere 24 sq km. Central Chanda’s 90% revenue from logging operations comes from Dhaba which also has two adult tigers and cubs, and is also a corridor. Opposing the move, Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel said, “Instead of handing over 30 sq km area from Dhaba to FDCM, its leftover area of 75 sq km surrounding Kanhargaon should immediately be included in the sanctuary, without which the new protected area is incomplete. The said area is a bottleneck formation and has maximum perennial streams used by wildlife.” Wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar said, “FDCM’s monoculture plantations (mainly teak) for generating revenue are now outdated, when climate change demands forests for carbon sequestration. Old, dense mixed forests having cultural heritage values are now more important to maintain biodiversity, as well as for ecological balance. These valuable forests are on the radar of the corporation, mainly in eastern Vidarbha, after the corporation retreated to north and western Maharashtra.” Bhamburkar added, “On one hand, the state government is striving to save old urban trees having heritage value and on the other hand, high-value forest is being clear-felled by FDCM. Such old mixed forests act as food security and habitat for people and wildlife. In the present scenario, FDCM’s expertise should be used for wasteland greenery projects.” State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre echoed the view. “In the present context, there is no need to give forest area to FDCM anywhere in the state. Instead, the corporation should be closed down in a phased manner, and the area with it should be handed over to the territorial wing. FDCM is still working with a 1952 mindset. Forest policies now aim for betterment and restoration of natural mix forest for the country’s ecological security, and not for revenue collection,” Dhotre said. Patel said, “What type of development is FDCM doing? Taking fat salaries for cutting forests is no big achievement. The environmental value of these forests is higher, considering food, water, soil and biodiversity conservation.” MISCELLANEOUS FORESTS HOLD KEY * Provide food to herbivores round the year for survival * Provide a perennial watershed, which is a pivotal prime habitat for wildlife survival * Have the highest capacity to drain rainwater into the earth * Increase rainy days and attract rain clouds by formation of low pressure * This forest-type sheds leaves that conserve ground moisture and provide manure for the growth of underground canopy * Wildlife-holding capacity in such areas is the highest as it provides ideal conditions for nesting hides, bushes, climbers, bamboo, shrubs, grass, orchids etc * Carbon absorption is maximum and the rate of soil erosion minimum * Provide life-supporting traditional food and farming equipment to locals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fdcm-wants-287sq-km-lush-forests-in-lieu-of-kanhargaon/articleshow/86923076.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Big-pandal neighbours face parking menace||KOLKATA: Police has already started receiving complaints from some irate residents residing close to some big budget pujas claiming that their lanes and bylanes are getting clogged by illegal parking. With the Kolkata Police banning parking of vehicles on the main road especially near all Puja pandals, misery has struck upon those living in the alleys surrounding big-ticket Pujas. Several residents are finding it difficult to even come out of their homes, with all the alleys being used by bikers as illegal parking zones. This year, with most revellers prefering to use private vehicles for pandal hopping due to the prevailing pandemic, the challenge of keeping the bylanes free of two-wheelers and four wheelers has become all the more difficult. Residents residing close to Naktala Udayan Sangha and Karbagan have already lodged complaints in this regard with police through the Twitter account of Kolkata Traffic Police. The puja organizers too have sought police help in this regard, claimed sources asking for additional parking space to be allotted to them. Lalbazar has asked local traffic guards to act and submit action taken reports as quickly as they can. " I humbly request you to please mark the lane in front of our house as "no parking or no entry" during the (Durga) Puja days. Every year we suffer as visitors of Naktala Udayan Sangha park their vehicles and block the road. Also many times people sit in their car and drink," wrote Sayak Datta, a resident of Naktala Arambagh Lane. "Thanks for the input. The same has been shared to the concerned traffic guard for necessary action," DCP (Traffic) Arijit Sinha's office replied. When contacted, Naktala Udayan Pally organizers accepted that there might be stray illegal parking issues but said they have discussed the matter with police in detail. "We have asked for police help to ensure that the bike and car menace does not deter the local residents from coming out at night. The puja site is located on an open ground at the Western side of Naktala Road. The designated parking lot is barely about 200 metres north from Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road and Naktala Road Crossing. That's not too much a distance to walk," said an officer. Another resident of Tilak Road adjoining the Deshapriya Park Puja said things became worse after midnight. “The cops are happy that there is no illegal parking on the main Rashbehari Avenue. Only we know how difficult it is to walk down our road,“ she said, refusing to disclose her name. The issue was discussed in multiple forums by Taltala puja organizers each year. "We have been raising the night parking issue and have been able to minimize its troubles a bit," stated an organizer. A resident of Rabindranath Tagore Road, an alley between James Long Sarani and Diamond Harbour Road, is finding it difficult to enter his house as bikers are parking their two wheelers in the alley and are walking off to queue up at the SB Park Puja at Panchanantala on DH Road. “The Puja committee has made efforts on the car and bike movement of the residents of the area in the evening but what about these bikers from outside who are parking their vehicles outside our homes at night? What are we supposed to do?“ asked Chatterjee, a retired government employee Several organizers want cops to take up more onus. They have cited an instance almost four years ago in Anandapur where a club secretary got booked for “obstructing the flow of traffic.“ While cops insisted that it was a case of contravening a high court order of not putting up gates, the club members said the blockade was to stop bikers from using the alley to park vehicles before visiting Pujas in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-illegal-parking/articleshow/86921090.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

One has even designed its theme as a tribute to their idol-maker who died of Covid last year. Fish seller Tarun Bera (57), better known as ‘Dukhe da’ in Behala’s Goragacha bazar area, is in charge of decorating the Behala Nutan Sangha pandal this year. Bera, an artist, has been struggling to keep his business afloat after the pandemic and support his family. He has employed 10 workers at Rs 500 per day for the last 34 days to decorate the pandal, based on the theme ‘Adhuna’ (The depiction of recent time) which was completed on Thursday. Coconuts have been used to give the pandal a unique design.

In their 84th year, they have designed their pandal on the theme ‘Apurna’ (Imbalance in Perfection). Every vendor received Rs 50,000-Rs 75,000 as advance between April to July. “These people are now a part of our extended family,” said Somen Dutta, general secretary of the puja committee. The committee spent Rs 15 lakh to make the advance payment and reduced this year’s budget to Rs 28 lakh. Aswininagar Bandhmahal Club in Baguihati has named its theme ‘Arun’ to pay homage to sculptor Arun Paul, an award-winning idol maker, who passed away in 2020 during the first Covid wave. “As an artist, this is my heartfelt tribute to another artist,” said Samrat Bhattacharyya, in charge of designing the pandal  Several other puja organizers are supporting the underprivileged.

Sudheer Kumar was speaking at an interaction organised by the Nehru Science Centre, Space Geeks, the National Centre For Science Communcators, and the Indian Space Industries Exhibition on Sunday evening. It was part of the World Space Week celebrations. Among the important missions on Isro’s time table is evaluating what is known as the reusable launch vehicle technology after the Gaganyaan mission the human space flight programme slated for launch towards the end of 2022 or early 2023. The reusable launch vehicle technology, perfected by Space X, will allow repeated use of the rocket, reducing the cost of missions. At present, Isro launch vehicles are discarded after use. Another new project is the design of a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) catering to mini, micro and nano satellites which will place 500 kg satellites in the low earth orbit. Provisionally expected to be launched in December 2021, this rocket can be managed by a small team of six people and readied in a week instead of months. Kumar further announced that Isro is working on a new type of the Gslv Mk-3 rocket using a semi-cryogenic engine, allowing it to carry 7.5-tonne satellites or payloads into the geostationary transfer orbit at an altitude of 30,000 kms. The present version of the Gslv Mk-3 enables it to lift 4-tonne payloads.  He also told viewers that Isro’s maiden mission to the sun, designated Aditya-1, will lift off next year. Originally slated for launch in 2020, it was rescheduled to 2022 because of the pandemic. A space docking experiment, in which two space craft will rendevouz in space, is also taking shape and will be used in future interplanetary missions, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-reusable-rockets-among-isros-top-missions-in-2022/articleshow/86924303.cms||Srinivas Laxman

Implementation of new unified development control and promotion regulations (UDCPR) has also helped. Between April and August in the current fiscal, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has sanctioned 374 building plans, which is 2.3 times the numbers registered during the corresponding period last fiscal. The current fiscal’s numbers are also slightly higher than that of 2019, which can be said to be the pre-pandemic period. As per data available with the NMC’s town planning department, 307 buildings plans were sanctioned between April and August in 2019. This figure dropped to 164, which is almost 50% cut, during the same period in 2020 after the pandemic struck. Though data for building plan sanctions for September 2021 is still under compilation, NMC officials said the numbers are high as compared to same period last fiscal and 2019. “In 2019-20, as against the target of Rs106 crore, NMC had earned revenue of only Rs56 crore. In six months of this fiscal, the revenue is Rs118 crore as against target of Rs102 crore,” said the officials. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “The pandemic had caused a huge setback to the realty sector in the last fiscal. Situation has remarkably improved after the second wave. The number of building plans were satisfactory even during the second wave.” Builder and corporator Virendra Kukreja said, “Realty sector was adversely affected in the last fiscal due to full lockdown and fear of the disease. Now, there is full relaxation and people now know how to protect themselves,” he said. Architect Pankaj Kriplani said, “There is normalcy in the realty sector for the last few months. Individuals and builders, who had kept their construction plans on hold for the last one year, are seeking sanctions. There are also those who regularly go for sanctions, so the total figure is high,” he said. The state government had implemented UDCPR in December 2020 which is said to be more beneficial for individuals and builders. But the number of plans did not increase between January and March. The increase was seen after April. Numbers are growing though NMC has doubled developmental charges and premium. Radhakrishnan and Kriplani said, “UDCPR is also playing a major role in boosting realty sector. UDCPR is beneficial for builders constructing multi-family dwelling units. Also, UDCPR is more favourable compared with transit oriented development (ToD) when it comes to small plots,” they said. The civic chief further said that various other new initiatives like building plan management system (BPMS) that are in pipeline will further push the realty market. In a development that hints at upbeat mood in the property market, the 26,997 sq ft (2,509 sq m) plot of Air India in Civil Lines was sold for Rs12,227.28 per sq ft, which is said to be highest-ever rate in city’s history. Kukreja Group from city had purchased the plot at the cost of Rs33.01 crore, which will increase to Rs35 crore after sale deed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/realty-sector-rising-374-building-plans-sanctioned-from-april-aug/articleshow/86923196.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kolhapur||Shetti: Goyal’s letter to Fadnavis of no use||Kolhapur: Former MP and farmers’ outfit leader Raju Shetti on Sunday dismissed Union minister Piyush Goyal’s assurances to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis that the Centre would not allow mills to pay the farmers fair and remunerative price (FRP) in instalments. Shetti, who is touring the sugar cane-producing districts of Maharashtra to mark protest against the proposal to pay FRP in instalments, said Goyal’s assurances in a letter sent to Fadnavis holds no importance and urged the Union minister to make a public statement to this effect instead. Shetti slammed a statement by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who claimed that sugar cane farmers in Gujarat benefitted from the FRP paid in three installments. Shetti alleged that Pawar is speaking the language of the BJP leaders. In September, Fadnavis had written to Goyal stating that the FRP payment method proposed was against the interest of farmers and plans to allow it should not come into effect. However, Goyal stated there were no such plans. He claimed that the Centre is prepared to amend the Sugarcane Control Order of 1966 to allow mills to pay FRP in three installments. “The letter written by Goyal to Fadnavis is a private one. It has no meaning unless Goyal holds a press conference and makes a public statement,” said Shetti. Shetti, who is in Beed, said the Centre changes laws hastily on the basis of majority it has in Parliament. “Once it is done, then there will be no voice against it. The farmers will be helpless. We are not just opposing it, but also suggesting measures to overcome the difficulties faced by the mills,” said Shetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-goyals-letter-to-fadnavis-of-no-use/articleshow/86917405.cms||---

Sources said, BJP MLA and KDA officers gave the letter to Meenakshi on Sunday, which incidentally was also the day when the ‘Terahnvi’ rituals of her husband were performed. Principal secretary, housing & development board, Deepak Kumar had issued the letter appointing Meenakshi as the officer on special duty in KDA. On Sunday, Govindnagar MLA Surendra Maithani and KDA officers reached Meenakshi’s residence at Barra and handed over the appointment letter to her. She was also given some other necessary documents and the officers requested her to complete the verification process at the earliest. The MLA said that Samajwadi Party MLA and some Congress leaders were spreading rumours that CM’s announcement is wrong and there will be no appointment. “I think the opponents with sick mentality should have patience and should not do politics after anyone’s death,” said Maithani. Manish Gupta had died under mysterious circumstances during a police raid at a hotel in Gorakhpur, where he was staying with his two friends hailing from Gurugram. Police had claimed that they raided the hotel after inputs of suspicious activities. They also entered the room where Gupta was staying with his two friends for checking. Police said Gupta fell on the ground while they were questioning the trio as he was drunk and suffered head injury. He was taken to BRD Medical College where he died. Manish’s family however claimed that he died after policemen assaulted him. His wife Meenakshi had accused police and hotel staff of a cover-up. Subsequently, the state government recommended a CBI probe into the death. A recommendation has been made to the Union government on the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish K Awasthi had stated in a press statement. Till the time the CBI takes over the inquiry, the special investigation team (SIT) set up for will probe the matter while the case was transferred from Gorakhpur to Kanpur on Meenakshi’s request to the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/deceased-bizmans-wife-handed-appointment-letter/articleshow/86921091.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Three companies — Veeda Clinical Research Limited, Sahajanand Medical Technologies Limited and Infinion Biopharma Limited — have filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for their initial public offerings (IPOs) since September this year. While Surat-headquartered Sahajanand Medical Technologies intends to raise Rs 1,500 crore, Ahmedabad-based clinical research organization (CRO) Veeda Clinical Research plans to raise Rs 831 crore, said sources. Healthcare is a sunrise sector and poised to grow significantly over the next decade with renewed focus on the sector in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The companies operating in the space are increasingly raising funds to meet the growing requirement of innovative therapies, diagnostics and healthcare services, said industry players. Gujarat-based companies such as Aashka Hospitals Limited, Ami Organics Limited and Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem Ltd have already raised funds via IPOs this year. “Growing awareness about diagnostics, medical devices, healthcare services and therapies after the outbreak of the Covid-19 have further brightened the growth prospects of the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. Hence, companies are raising funds to tap into the growing requirements in the healthcare space,” said Vaibhav Shah, managing director, Monarch Networth Capital, a city-based financial services company. “With the equity market soaring on the back of strong retail investor sentiment, companies are also getting good valuations by listing their stocks. This is another reason why companies are choosing IPOs to raise funds,” he added. Not just Gujarat, healthcare and pharma companies across the country have turned to the primary market this year to mop-up growth capital. Prominent among them are Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited, Glenmark Lifesciences Limited, Windlas Biotech Limited, Krsnaa Diagnostics and Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences. Public issues of companies like Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Healthium Medtech Limited, Wellness Forever Medicare Limited and Supriya Lifesciences Ltd among others are in pipeline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-healthcare-firms-churn-out-ipos/articleshow/86921089.cms||Kalpesh Damor

He then drops his sons at school before heading off to meet someone. Hardik has some big news to share. Later that day, a police team raids an establishment in Mumbai and recovers a stash of drugs. Hardik checks the newspapers again the following day and pores over a news story about the drug bust. This time, he can afford the vacation his family has been asking for. The reward for the drug tip-off should be sizable. The influence of the ‘khabri’ network may have waned with the advent of technology, but for drug busts, drug enforcement agencies still rely on human intelligence. “Technology can support and increase accuracy of human intel but cannot replace it,” says DCP Datta Nalawade of Mumbai’s anti-narcotics cell. Typically, anti-drugs law enforcement agencies verify information before carrying out a raid. Often, a confidential informant can help verify the information on ground. “Mumbai has a large number of individuals who make a living out of supplying information to agencies full-time,” said Nalawade. Many informants live on the fringes of the criminal world. “That is how they gain authentic information,” said a former IPS officer. A good reward is usually the motivation to snitch. The police have a secret fund while national agencies could offer a percentage depending on the recovery. “At times, a tip-off comes from someone in the drug supply chain who is disgruntled, offended or humiliated,” he said.. “We look for a weak link in the supply chain and use certain strategies to get details, or we introduce one of our trusted informants into the network,” said a official. A retired officer recalled how drug informants were developed a decade ago. “One of my informants was anxious as his wife was in a road crash and needed blood. I agreed to donate it. I would remind him thereafter that we now had a ‘bond of blood’ and he should deliver when I needed him to,” he recalls. For informants, a good reward is usually the motivation to snitch. The police have a secret fund while national agencies could offer a percentage depending on the recovery of drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-drug-busts-in-tech-age-police-still-rely-on-khabris/articleshow/86925524.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Ahmedabad||‘Silence from mom spurred grave fear’||On Sunday, horror dawned on the relatives of Shivansh — they woke up to mounting alarm caused by viral videos showing that the baby had been abandoned by his father. Before that moment, Anita and Jitendra Rathod had been under the impression that Shivansh was in Vadodara with their niece Mehendi Pethani and Sachin Dixit. To her friends and family, Pethani was known as Heena. Shivansh is the child of Pethani and her former live-in partner Dixit. Dixit had abandoned Shivansh in Gandhinagar on Friday night and through Saturday the plight of the winsome child had made national headlines. The Rathods said they love Shivansh deeply. "Early on Sunday morning, a neighbour came to us and asked how someone could abandon a cute little baby," said Anita. "The neighbour showed us a video. I was devastated to see it was my own Shivansh, who had spent nearly six months with us in Bopal." Anita said that Pethani was her elder sister’s daughter. "In 2020 when Heena became pregnant, she informed us that she had married Sachin," Anita said. "We did not interfere as Sachin appeared to be a well-settled person and a good man." Anita said that neither Pethani nor Dixit talked about his family. Pethani always assured Anita that all was well. At one stage, Dixit rented a house using his own name. "In July, Sachin informed us that he had been transferred to Vadodara and the couple moved there," Anita said. "After that our telephonic conversations were mostly about Shivansh." Anita said Pethani sent videos recording the developmental milestones of Shivansh. "I last spoke to her on October 7 and then the next day she sent me some more videos of Shivansh," she said. "I never realized that would be her last communication. She was online most of the time, but had not checked WhatsApp messages after 8.07am on Friday," she said. "Our calls to her on Sunday were unanswered. Later that day, we contacted Gandhinagar Police and informed them about Shivansh and told them that we feared something bad had happened to his mother." Killer’s wife sensed affair, unaware of baby: Aradhana Dixit, the wife of Sachin Dixit, has told police she was not aware that her husband had a child with another woman. Aradhana lives with Dixit’s parents in Gandhinagar’s Sector 26. Aradhana told the cops she did sense that her husband was having an extramarital affair. She said her suspicions had triggered a massive quarrel two years ago. In the presence of Aradhana, cops searched Dixit’s laptop for some proof of his relationship with Mehendi Pethani. However, cops said he seemed to have been careful enough to store no evidence at his residence in Gandhinagar. As of now, cops have not been able to find even a picture in which Pethani and Dixit are together. Ansh to Shivansh: Bloody trail of extramarital affair: Several officers in the state police were quick to draw similarities between the murder case of Sweety Patel – incidentally also took place in Vadodara – and Heena alias Mehendi Pethani. In both cases, it was a case of the prime accused living dual lives where they were living with two women, had children from both partners and killed the ‘other woman’ when they started demanding the centre stage in their men’s lives. While Shivansh lost his mother in the latest case, it was Ansh who had lost his mother in July this year. Sachin first put blame on ‘abandoned woman,’ later agreed to killing her While Sachin was brought to Gandhinagar for questioning, the probe was centered around Shivansh. When it became clear that he was not the child from Sachin’s wife, cops kept questioning him about Shivansh’s biological mother. Sachin claimed that he was not feeling well. He was given three hours and even a clinical psychologist was roped in. He kept evading questions and even claimed that his lover had deserted him and the child. WHY GAUSHALA: Sachin Dixit, Shivansh’s father who left the child outside the Swaminarayan Gaushala was familiar with the area, as the family used to get milk from there. Baby used to good life: Shivansh, the child called Shivu at home, was born on December 10, 2020. He completed 10 months this Saturday. He is used to expensive confectionaries, flavoured baby food, air conditioner among other luxuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silence-from-mom-spurred-grave-fear/articleshow/86921184.cms||---

The police have arrested an 18-year-old youth identified as Abraham V Joshua of Thirumala. According to the police, as many as 19 cars, most of them costing over Rs 8 lakh, were found damaged on Sunday morning. The window panes of all those cars were found to be smashed open. The articles inside the cars were left in disarray as though the culprit ransacked the interiors of the vehicles for costly materials. An investigation that followed ended at the residence of Abraham Joshua, a higher secondary school dropout, who was preparing to go abroad in search of a job. State railway police sub-inspector R S Bijukumar said Joshua was a substance addict. On Saturday evening he had a quarrel with his parents regarding his substance addiction and he left the house in a fit of rage. He reached the railway station at night and vandalized the vehicles. ''We suspect that his intention was to commit theft. Several car phone charging units and costly sunglasses were recovered from his bag,'' the SI said. He added that Joshua had unknowingly dropped his wallet near one of the cars. At first the police assumed that the wallet belonged to the car owner. Yet the police decided to conduct an inquiry and reached his residence tracking the address on the Aadhar card in the wallet. He was charged with sections of theft and causing damages to properties. The police also said there was a possibility that the accused vandalized more vehicles and the owners took them unaware of the damages, especially before the daybreak. ''We received calls from two such owners later in the day,'' the SI said. He added that the alleged crime was conducted sometime between 11 pm on Saturday and 2 am on Sunday. It was raining then and this might be the reason why the security guards or the staff of the agency managing the parking lot did not hear any noise. Meanwhile, railway users alleged that this was not a one-off incident. Similar incidents, albeit in lesser intensity, were reported numerous times in the past. Their repeated pleas to improve the security of the parking ground fell on deaf ears. Hari, a government employee residing in the city said he had a similar experience two years ago when he was posted in Kottayam district and regularly commuted via train for work. One night when he returned, he found that his motorcycle along with several others in the same row, were lying on the ground, apparently being pushed down by someone. His helmet was missing. There were scratches all over the vehicle apparently made using stones. When he raised a complaint to the staff of the contract agency, they intimidated him instead and told him to clear off immediately unless he wanted more trouble. Liyons J, the secretary of Friends on Rails, an association of regular rail users in the state, said despite collecting hefty amounts as fee, the agencies that manage the parking lots offer little responsibility for ensuring safety of the vehicles. The railway authorities too supported these irresponsible attitudes of the agencies. ''Often, the staff behave like goons, trying to threaten and intimidate whoever raised a complaint,'' he said, adding that it was high time, the railway authorities started valuing the money paid by the rail users and improved the security by installing surveillance cameras, employing responsible workers and constructing proper shelters for the vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-held-for-vandalizing-19-cars/articleshow/86921146.cms||---

Talking to reporters, she said the agencies have arrested two of the six accused cops, but she wants them to be hanged and the other accused to be arrested soon. “I will continue my struggle,” said Meenakshi. In a tweet, she said all the accused should be arrested before her husband Manish Gupta’s birthday on October 16. “It would be good if all the killers of my husband are caught before his birthday that falls on October 16,” she tweeted. She also demanded that the trial of the case should take place in Kanpur. “I want the trial of the case should be held in Kanpur court because I cannot travel to Gorakhpur with my little kid. Moreover, I don’t want to step on the land (Gorakhpur) that ruined my and my son’s lives,” she said. “I will appeal to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath regarding this,” she added. Meenakshi had tagged the reward declaration letter containing photographs of the accused cops, wherein the reward of Rs 25,000 was increased to Rs 1 lakh. She also appealed to the people to cooperate and ensure she gets justice for her husband and the accused are put behind the bars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/hang-the-cops-arrest-othersbefore-my-husbands-bday/articleshow/86921122.cms||---

Organisers of the events across Nashik city have decided to keep the event a low-key affair though they will ensure the tradition of the puja is carried on without any break. Gandhinagar-based Sarbojanin Duga Puja Trust, celebrating the event for the 68th year this time, has asked all its members to offer restraint and celebrate the festival modestly. “Since Covid restrictions are on, we have reduced the size of the Goddess Durga idol from 20 feet to four feet as per government’s orders. The idol has been installed in the Club House where all the rituals will be carried out,” Sujoy Gupta, president of Nashik Sarbojanin Durga Puja Trust, said. The organisers have also made an arrangement that will ensure not more than 20 people are allowed in for Pushpanjali. “All the programmes would held by respecting the Covid norms,” Gupta said.

Mohammad Hameed’s job is more meticulous, painstaking and takes hours of hard work behind the curtains. The lone Muslim makeup artist in Sangam City’s oldest Patharchatti Ramleela committee, who also worked in the Anupam Kher-starrer, Laila Majnu, knows that his job in the Ramleela is not about glamour, but to recreate the epic characters of Ram, Sita, Hanuman or Ravan on stage. Associated with the Ramleela committee for two decades, when he would enact roles of Parshuram and Kevat, Hameed, 45, began donning the role a makeup of artist since eight years. “As I earlier played roles of Parushram, Kevat and Sugreev in different Ramleelas in Sangam city, I understand the significance of makeup. It has to be an impeccable job and goes beyond beautifying artists,” he said. “We begin work at least four hours before the Ramleela is enacted every day and attend to artistes till the show ends. The objective is not to slicken the hair or dabble in paint, but to bring alive the celestial characters before the audience. Our job becomes hectic when there are several characters at a time on stage and deadlines become stringent,” said Hameed. His brother, Arshad, lends support in his work, but the final touches are by him. “I do makeup of prominent Ramleela characters and my brother does it for supporting actors. We spend hours to achieve perfection,” he added. Hameed said, “Each character in a Ramlila has a different look and our primary job is to do justice to the character. When audiences appreciate the characters, the efforts of backroom artists are recognised. We first visualise the characters and then discuss the plan with the director.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/lone-muslim-makeup-man-enlivens-ramleela-with-his-epic-brush/articleshow/86921142.cms||---

All those who have been transferred out have been in the police headquarters for the past five years, which means the tenure of these officers have become co-terminus with the tenure of former state police chief Loknath Behera. All the eight, who were handling key segments like establishment, modernisation, purchases etc., have been sent to offices outside the police headquarters. The transfer list that was issued by state police chief Anil Kant on Saturday is learnt to have been issued on the direct instructions from the chief minister’s office. The timing of the transfer has raised many eyebrows as several decisions regarding modernization of the force, including purchases, had invited widespread criticism, including from the CAG. “The order that was issued on a public holiday, was on direct instructions from the CM’s office and even staff of the police headquarters were caught unawares. Also, some of those transferred officials are key members of the ruling party’s union,” sources said. Unlike in the case of the usual transfers, where the corresponding file would originate in the section concerned and travel to the top, the latest transfer list was handled at the topmost level without the section offices getting any wind of the changes. Those transferred include Zeena A, Bindu V C and Gopalakrishnan M (senior superintendents), Binu Kumar M, Kumari Manju S, Shibu A, Balu K and Rajesh H (junior superintendents). They have been transferred to offices, including office of the city police commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram; women’s battalion, state crime records bureau, armed police battalion headquarters, telecommunications headquarters and office of district police chief, Thiruvananthapuram rural. Like those who got transferred, those who have been appointed to the headquarters were also clueless about their transfer. Home department sources, meanwhile, said that all those who have been transferred out have completed five years in the headquarters, which is why the transfer. “Unlike in other offices where the officers get transferred after they complete three years or when they get promoted, in the case of police headquarters, there are enough posts to accommodate them there itself. But the government decided that those who have completed five years need not continue,” a senior officer in the police HQ said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-transfers-8-key-officers-from-police-headquarters/articleshow/86919344.cms||KP Saikiran

Cops, who have arrested the accused, claimed that he was annoyed with the regular arguments with his wife and mother-in-law. The accused, identified as Mahesh, worked as a financer. According to the cops, they received a PCR call about the murder around 9.45pm on Saturday. Cops reached the spot and found the bodies of two women, who had been shot dead. During the probe, officers found the accused to be standing at the crime spot. Cops questioned him about his identity. “In reply, he told us that he had done his work by killing his wife and mother-in-law,” an officer said. The accused was apprehended and taken to the police station. The deceased were identified as Nidhi (21) and her mother Beero (55). Police said that they have recovered eight empty cartridges from the spot. “The autopsy report will clear the fact that about how many times both of them were shot,” the officer added. DCP (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said Nidhi and Mahesh had a love marriage in January 2020 against the wishes of their parents. “Mahesh and his wife started living with his mother-in-law, but soon after their marriage, problems started between the couple,” the DCP said. Police said there were constant arguments between the husband and wife at home and Beero used to support her daughter during such arguments. “We have found different reasons behind the arguments, among which one of them was that Mahesh did not support the family financially. Another issue was related to their one and half-year-old child. The woman used to tell him that she will keep the child in her custody,” the officer said adding that all such facts were being probed. On Saturday, after another quarrel, Mahesh whipped out a pistol and shot the two women. Joint commissioner (Western Range) Atul Katiyar said a case has been registered and further probe is ongoing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-shoots-wife-mother-in-law-in-w-delhi-arrested/articleshow/86919326.cms||---
---||Delhi||Woman cop among 2 held in Delhi for taking bribe to settle rape case||NEW DELHI: The CBI raided a police station in the city and arrested two Delhi Police personnel, including a woman sub-inspector, for allegedly demanding and accepting bribe from a rape accused in order to settle the case. The incident was reported from Malviya Nagar. This is the second raid on Delhi cops in the past three months. Earlier, the anti-graft agency had arrested a cop posted in Subhash Place police station for accepting a bribe. A month before that, CBI had arrested three policemen in another bribery case. Incidentally, the complainant in the latest case is a cop too. CBI had received a complaint from a SI who had been accused of rape by a woman cop. According to sources, a woman constable, posted in south Delhi, had lodged a complaint of sexual assault on August 3 against SI Manoj who was earlier posted in the same area. A case was subsequently registered under relevant sections of the IPC and the investigation was handed over to woman sub inspector Romi, posted at Malviya Nagar police station. During the probe, Manoj applied for anticipatory bail at the sessions court in Saket, wherein he was asked to join the probe and his anticipatory bail plea was dismissed. He later moved Delhi High Court where too he was asked to join the investigation. In his complaint to CBI, SI Manoj claimed that the investigating officers were trying to extort money from him in order to give him a clean chit. After receiving the complaint, the agency laid a trap and asked Manoj to give in to the demand. According to sources, SI Manoj reached the police station around 8pm on Saturday and called up the woman SI — the investigative officer of the case — and told her that he had brought the “documents” as asked for. The woman sub inspector, Romi, was not present at the police station and apparently asked an assistant SI, Lekhram, to collect the “documents” on her behalf. However, the two cops — Lekhram and SI Romi — were arrested while accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 from SI Manoj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-cop-among-2-held-for-taking-bribe-to-settle-rape-case/articleshow/86919360.cms||---

The data also show that the number of such surgeries has been rising over the years. While only 19 transgender people, including 11 trans women, received the assistance in 2018-19, the number of beneficiaries rose to 83, including 41 trans women, in 2021-22 so far. Of the total of 191 transgender people who received the assistance from 2018, 127 are trans women and 64, trans men. The department gives a reimbursement of Rs 2.5 lakh for trans women and Rs 5 lakh for trans men after the surgery. Those in the transgender community said the number of people going for female-to-male transition is fewer due to the surgical complexities involved and fear of rejection from family and abuse on the streets. “The surgery to transition to male from female is expensive as well as more complex, which includes phalloplasty where a penis is constructed. In fact, there are hundreds who want a transition from female to male but they are scared of abuse from the society and worry about their future,” said Hrithik M, a trans man. Authorities said though society’s approach towards transgender people has been changing no studies have been done to find out why the number of trans women has been higher than trans men. Besides proposing to ensure the mental and physical fitness of those undergoing sex-change surgeries, the department also advises counselling sessions for six months before and after the surgery. Shyama S Prabha, project coordinator of transgender cell said that the absence of expert doctors and protocols poses a serious hurdle in gender reassignment surgeries. “The state has initiated procedures to formulate protocols for conducting such surgeries in hospitals in the future. Other than collecting a consent letter from the patient and a fitness certificate from a psychiatrist, no other protocols are followed in the hospitals in Kerala. Many develop post-surgical complications,” she said, adding that the government is planning to conduct a study into complications that arise after such surgeries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sex-change-surgeries-on-rise-in-state-reveals-data/articleshow/86919376.cms||T C Sreemol

The statewide tally (2,294) was under 3,000 for the eighth consecutive day. However, considering the higher-than-usual daily tally in the last 10 days, the weekly Covid growth rate has increased to 0.07% after staying at 0.06% for almost a month. The number of sealed buildings too has increased to 53 from an average of 40 last week. BMC officials are not too worried at the moment. “The daily test positivity is still around 1.2% and the number of critical patients are lower than before,” said an official. According to the BMC dashboard, the number of critical patients is 298 and 25% of 2,221 Covid ICU beds in the city are full. Of the total 18,000 Covid beds in the city, only 10% are occupied. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force, said that the Covid-19 situation is “erratic” at the moment. “Cases have risen in Mumbai and in some villages of Ahmednagar. We need to wait and watch these areas for a few days to understand if this rise will worsen or settle down soon,” said Dr Joshi. The state has been trying to increase the vaccination rates with special drives, but the festive mood has dampened the campaign. “At the moment, 65% of the people in state have got their first vaccine shot. We need to increase this number to 80%,” said a state public health department official. “As vaccination is a voluntary decision, we cannot force anyone to take the shot.” As per the Covid update on Sunday, the Mumbai region has the highest number of cases (860) and Pune is second with 647 cases. The state’s overall Covid tally since March 2020 stands at 65 lakh, including 7.48 lakh in city. The state toll is 1,39,542, including 16,158 deaths in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-tally-under-500-but-weekly-rate-sees-a-surge/articleshow/86924305.cms||---

On the fourth day of Navaratra, the idol of the Goddess Mahalaxmi is taken in a palanquin to meet the goddess of the Tremboli-Tembali hills, located on the outskirts of the city. Thousands of devotees usually visit the city to see the palanquin. However, due to the ongoing pandemic, visitors were asked not to gather again this year. On Sunday., the palanquin was garlanded with flowers and accompanied by policemen. The palanquin reached Temblai hill at around 12.30pm. Malojiraje Chhatrapati, a member of the Kolhapur royal family, attended the event. After the event, the ‘winter melon’, on which a picture of the demon ‘Kolhasur’ was painted, was broken. Every year, devotees rush to get the piece of the melon as the ‘prasad’. However, this time, very few people were allowed to attend the ceremony. On Kohala Panchami, the goddess Ambabai (Mahalaxmi) destroyed a demon called ‘Kolhasur’. Thereafter, the city was called Kolhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mahalaxmis-procession-to-temblai-hill-without-devotees/articleshow/86917447.cms||---

Nithin Hari, son of Hari, an engineer working with Air India, is the deceased. He was a third-year MBBS student of Sree Gokulam Medical College, Venjarammood. His friend and batchmate Vishnu Suresh is admitted to hospital with critical injuries. The police have arrested the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident, booking him for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. According to police, the accident occurred around 4am on the bypass road near Chanthavila. Nithin and Vishnu were travelling to Thiruvananthapuram central railway station on the latter’s motorcycle. Nithin resides at Kothamangalam in Ernakulam and he was supposed to board a train on Sunday morning to go home. It was Nithin who rode the bike. They were mowed down by the MUV going in the opposite direction, and driven by Pratheesh, 31, of Kilimanoor. Police said that there were six men in the MUV and all of them were heavily drunk. They were returning after seeing off their friend who took a flight from Trivandrum International Airport here. The MUV was apparently speeding and hit the motorcycle after entering the opposite lane while negotiating a sharp curve. After knocking down the youths, the MUV crashed into the compound of a house nearby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mbbs-student-killed-in-accident/articleshow/86921194.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Paying Rs 450 wages per month is a form of forced labour: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Holding that the payment of Rs 450 per month to an employee as wages is clearly a form of forced labour and is violative of Article 23 of the Constitution, the Allahabad high court has directed the Director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, MD Eye Hospital, Prayagraj, to pay the minimum wages as prescribed in the state of Uttar Pradesh from June 15, 2001, the date of initial appointment of the petitioner within four months after deducting the amount paid to him till date. Article 23 of the Constitution provides right against exploitation and prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour and makes any contravention of this provision an offence punishable in accordance with law. Allowing a writ petition filed by one Tufail Ahmad Ansari, Justice Pankaj Bhatia directed the Director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, MD Eye Hospital, Prayagraj, to pass order in respect of the regularisation of the petitioner within four months, as he had been working prior to December 31, 2001 and as per the 2016 rule of the state government, he is entitled to regularisation. The writ petition was filed stating that the petitioner has been working as an employee in Director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, MD Eye Hospital, Prayagraj, since June 15, 2001 on a class-IV post and is being paid wages at the rate of Rs. 450 per month since his initial engagement. It was also stated that despite the petitioner being entitled for being considered for regularisation as per 2016 Rules, the case of the petitioner is not being considered. After hearing the counsel for the petitioner and state government counsel, the court allowed the petition, observing, “In the instructions of the state government, it is admitted that the wages of Rs. 450 per month being paid to the petitioner are not the minimum wages prescribed in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This court is unable to fathom as to how the state can continue the exploitation of class-IV post employees for about 20 years on the strength of government order (GO), which has been relied upon by the UP government counsel in support of his contention. If the stand of the state counsel is accepted, this court would also be guilty of ignoring the plight of class-IV persons who are being exploited by the state.” The court delivered this judgment on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/paying-rs-450-wages-per-monthis-a-form-of-forced-labour-hc/articleshow/86921181.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Delhi||Delhi cop who saved 4 from fire shoots brother-in-law||NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police constable shot dead his brother-in-law, a sub-inspector with Haryana Police, at Safdarjung Enclave on Sunday morning over a dispute regarding a loan. The accused then surrendered himself at a police station. The accused, Vikram Singh, was posted at Greater Kailash police station for the past 2-3 years. In February, Singh had single-handedly rescued four people, including a 91-year-old man, from a residential building in Greater Kailash that had caught fire. Police got a call around 8am about the incident that took place in Krishna Nagar of Safdarjung Enclave. A team reached there and found the victim, Virender Nandal (36), a native of Rohtak, dead with a bullet injury in the head. Nandal, who was also a judo player, was staying at Singh’s house for the past 5-6 days. The constable had taken money from Nandal and asked for some time to return it. However, police said he was being pressured by his brother-in-law to return the money. DCP (Southwest) Gaurav Sharma said, “During an altercation, Nandal hurled abuses at Singh. The constable then shot Nandal with his service pistol. He then went to Greater Kailash police station and confessed to having committed murder. His wife was sleeping in another room when the incident took place.” A case under Indian Penal Code Section 302 has been registered against Singh at Safdarjung Enclave police station. During investigation, Singh told the police officers that he was annoyed with Nandal for hurling abuses at him and his family because of the loan. “Singh reportedly told Nandal that he would sell his land in the village to pay him, but he didn’t listen. However, we are probing whether this statement is correct or not,” said a senior officer. The family members of the deceased claimed that Singh might have planned the murder. An officer said they were probing whether the victim was shot while he was sleeping. The officer didn’t have any information about Nandal having participated in any national games.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cop-who-saved-4-from-fire-shoots-bro-in-law/articleshow/86919367.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Several contenders vying for post of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad president||HARIDWAR: Several candidates, all from Haridwar, are in the fray for the elections to the post of the president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, the apex body of seers, after the seat fell vacant following the death of incumbent Narendra Giri last month. Giri was president of ABAP when he was found hanging at Baghambari Mutt in Prayagraj (UP) on September 20. A suicide note purportedly handwritten by the mahant said that he was forced to take his own life as he was being “blackmailed” by his disciple, Anand Giri, and two others over a “morphed photo with a girl”. Now seers of the 13 akharas of the country will meet at Prayagraj on October 25 to discuss the elections which are likely to be hotly-contested as seers from different akharas will stake their claim to the post. These include Mansa Devi temple president and Niranjani Akhara secretary Swami Ravindra Puri, Nirvani Akhara chief Swami Ravindra Puri and Juna Akhara international patron and incumbent general secretary Hari Giri. There were speculations that Mahant Rajendra Das, a representative of the Bairagi akharas, is also in the fray. Rajendra Das, however, told TOI that they have not been consulted or informed about the Prayagraj meeting. “This is despite the fact that an election will be invalid if any of the three sects of akharas do not participate in it,” he said. Notably, the Bairagi Vaishnav Akharas — which include Nirmohi, Digambar and Nirvana Akharas — had announced their own parishad in Kumbh in Haridwar this year. The akharas were upset with Narendra Giri and had alleged that he was discriminating against them. Rajendra Das said the role of the ABAP is to manage the Kumbh fair and the seers were showing “unnecessary haste” to fill the position. He further said that Bairagi akharas will take part in the election” if they are not neglected and if 26 bonafide representatives of the 13 akharas are allowed to vote in it”. “This did not happen when Narendra Giri was elected for the second term,” he said. Other seers of the Bairagi akharas claimed that “there has been a tradition of the posts of president and general secretary being shared by Sanyasi and Bairagi akhara seers.” “As the outgoing president Narendra Giri was from Niranjani akhara, which is a Sanyasi akhara, the post this time should go to Rajendra Das, who belongs to a Bairagi akhara,” ABAP’s former spokesperson Baba Hathyogi said. Ravindra Puri (Niranjani Akhara), however, said there was no such tradition. “Mahant Brij Kishore Puri of our akhara had been its president for over two decades followed by Mahant Shankar Bharati of our akhara, who also remained in the office for about 25 years. Mahant Govind Das of Bada Akhara Udasin had been general secretary with Shankar Bharati during his entire tenure,” Puri said. Puri added that if an ABAP office-bearer dies before completing term, the post goes to the akhara to which he belonged for the remaining period of his tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/several-contenders-vying-for-post-of-abap-prez/articleshow/86919342.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 95% of registered jobless are educated||AHMEDABAD: Although the Gujarat government has been claiming that the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the country, official numbers reveal that as of March 2021, there were over four lakh unemployed persons who were registered with government agencies. Significantly, just 5% of these unemployed persons are semi-literate. In response to a question by Khedbrahma MLA Ashwin Kotwal in the recently concluded monsoon session of the Gujarat assembly, the state government informed that 4,06,007 persons have registered for employment with the state government. Of these, 3,85,506 are educated while only 20,501 are semi-literate. The state government has in the past few months, claimed that Gujarat’s unemployment rate is the lowest in the country and that huge employment opportunities are being provided to youth of the state. In his pre-Independence Day speech earlier this year, former CM Vijay Rupani said that the unemployment rate in Gujarat is just 1.8%, the lowest in the country. Earlier, on August 6 this year, quoting Union labour and employment ministry’s ‘Employment Exchanges Statistics-2018’, labour and employment principal secretary Anju Sharma had said that Gujarat tops in providing jobs. Gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate of 2.2%. The Directorate of Employment and Training (DET) which functions under the department of labour and employment, is the nodal agency that registers youth for employment in the state. At present, 48 employment exchanges are functioning under the DET, which coordinates with prospective employers in getting jobs for those who have registered at employment exchanges. In a written reply to the unstarred question, the government said that based on demand made by those offering jobs, candidates registered with DET are recommended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/95-of-registered-jobless-are-educated/articleshow/86921163.cms||---

A senior excise official told TOI that due to easy passage, the price of heroin has drastically come down. “While the street value of a hawng (a package of 12 to 13gm of heroin) was over Rs 80,000 when the border was sealed due to Covid-19 last year, the same can be purchased for Rs 25,000 in Myanmar and sold in Mizoram for Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000,” the official said, adding that the Myanmar administration was too occupied with the civil war to check narcotics trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-myanmar-hit-by-unrest-drug-flow-rises-and-prices-fall/articleshow/86925536.cms||HC Vanlalruata

SHRC member V K Beenakumari is set to visit the Palappilli forest range office on Monday following the complaints of the residents about the losses they are facing because of the attacks by straying wild animals. Four people, including three tribespeople and two plantation workers, were killed in wild-elephant attacks in the forest areas under Palappilli and nearby Pariyaram and Vellikkulangara range offices this year.Interestingly, the forest department on Sunday announced formation of an elephant task force in the Palappilli area. But the nature of its composition was not clear. Experts in the management of man-animal conflict point out that a team tasked to manage man-animal conflict should have sufficient man-power, vehicles and equipment like high-intensity lights, noise generating devices as well as veterinary staff and darting systems. But the present strategy is to deploy the lower-level forest watchers, who are mostly contract workers, for the highly risky operations to drive away wild animals the experts point out. A forest department also opened an outpost at Palappilli on Sunday by renovating an old one, which was remaining defunct. The only welcome measure is that the department has posted three staff and allocated a vehicle at the outpost, but these steps are absolutely poor substitutes for effective long-term measures, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/shrc-member-to-visit-palappilli-range/articleshow/86919411.cms||T Ramavarman

The businessman was a victim of cyberattacks on his two bank-accounts on two consecutive days. “On June 28, I got a call from an unknown person on my mobile. The man offered me Rs 300 Covid-related discount on my dues towards the credit card. He sent me an SMS on the mobile phone and further asked me to share the same, but I refused to do so. During our conversation itself, a sum of Rs 37,000 got debited, leaving me shell-shocked,” he said. The businessman said the conmen attacked his other account with a private bank on the next day and took away Rs 18,500. “I pleaded with police as well as the banks to take cognisance of my complaints, but to no avail. After repeated follow-ups, the police finally registered a complaint around two-and-a-half months after the crime took place,” he said. Based on the complaint of the man, Kranti Chowk police on October 9 registered an offence against unidentified suspects under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-duped-of-rs-55000-over-covid-discount-offer/articleshow/86917506.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Couple never mingled with us: A neighbour||The lazy afternoon siesta of the residents of Darshanam Oasis complex near the busy Khodiyarnagar Road was broken on Sunday when a couple of police vehicles entered the colony of seven towers housing 113 apartments with a man whose expressions were unnerved. The police vehicles invited a few curious stares as the cops escorted a man to the first floor of the G tower. But as more policemen and an entourage of media reached there, the residents came out on their balconies and peeped outside their windows with several questions on their faces. Soon, they realized that their quiet and sleepy complex was at the centre of an investigation that had been making headlines since Saturday morning. The dead body of Mahendi alias Heena Pethani was found in a decomposed state in G-104 apartment. Pathani is mother of the one-year-old boy who was abandoned at Swaminarayan Gaushala in Gandhinagar. Pethani was living at this rented apartment with her married lover Sachin Dixit and their over one-year-old son Shivansh for the last few months. For the last three days, the complex was in a festive mood, but no one would have thought in their wildest dreams that a woman was murdered there and her body had been packed in the apartment. "There was no stench at all. In fact, on Saturday night police had come to the complex to make us wind up the celebrations as it was too late, but they too did not find anything suspicious," said a resident named Amit. Packed body kept under washbasin: On Sunday when the G-102 apartment at Darshanam Oasis complex was opened by police, a severe stench emanated from the house. But the body was nowhere visible. When police questioned Sachin Dixit, he pointed towards a small cabinet below the washing sink in the kitchen. On opening the cabinet, the decomposed body of Heena was found. A girl was found in Vadodara too: On a cold December morning of 2017, like Shivansh, a one-year-old girl was found on the stairs of Verai Mata Temple in Atladara. A vegetable vendor named Kaushik Gandhi had found the girl wrapped in a blanket and had informed police. The girl’s custody was later handed over to a child care home in Nizampura and she was named Priyanshi. Police could never find her biological parents. PI Joshi to probe case: A murder case will be registered against Sachin Dixit at Bapod police station and the investigation will be done by the inspector U J Joshi with support of a specially constituted team. Offence will be registered on the complaint given by an inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/couple-never-mingled-with-us-a-neighbour/articleshow/86921259.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra bandh today: Shops to stay shut, buses may not ply||MUMBAI: The bandh called in the state by the ruling MVA, an alliance of the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP, on Monday to protest against the death of farmers in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence may keep BEST buses off city roads. Restaurants and shops decided they would “voluntarily” keep shut till 4pm, said office-bearers from the respective trade associations. Transporters said they would support the bandh, which might temporarily hit supply of essentials such as fruits and vegetables. The impact of the bandh is likely to be highest in the Shiv-Sena-dominated areas of central Mumbai as well as in neighbouring Thane, where the MVA constituents have a strong presence. The BEST Kamgar Union affiliated to the Shiv Sena called for a bus bandh and if it is heeded, it could cripple movement in the city at a time when local trains are not accessible to all because of Covid-19 restrictions. About 27 lakh commuters are expected to be affected. Shiv Sena unions have also appealed to auto and taxi drivers to stay off roads, although the leading unions for these two modes of transport said they would not support the bandh. Trains, the metro and aggregator cabs will also ply unless there is protest at stations or on streets, said sources. There will be heavy deployment of police personnel, even at railway stations. Joint anti-sabotage checks of the RPF and GRP, with deployment of the RPF dog squad, have been arranged at sensitive stations and on major trains across the state, said the Western Railway. It said 600 RPF personnel would man stations across the state. “All major stations of the division are deployed with the Quick Response Team,” a spokesperson said. Shiv Sena union leader Suhas Samant claimed that the bus bandh would be “total” in the city and drivers had been asked to join the protest. The rival BEST Workers’ Union led by Shashank Rao said the ruling party should ensure that essential services like buses remain functioning instead of inconveniencing the common man by going off the roads. The BEST administration has appealed to drivers to report to duty and operate buses from 27 bus depots. Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said: “FRTWA, after request of Shiv Sena and other party leaders, have decided to keep shops closed till 4pm in support of bandh call by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in protest of killing of farmers.” An official from the hoteliers’ association Ahar also said most restaurants would “voluntarily” remain closed till 4pm. A municipal official said BMC offices would function as usual. “Local trains and bus services are not likely to be hit. We expect that staff would be able to reach the office as it is a working day,” the official said. The BMC headquarters in Fort has a staff strength of 7,000. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut described the incident in Lakhimpur Kheri as the death of democracy. “We must all come together and show support and solidarity to the farmers. All of Maharashtra is with the farmers and we will make this bandh successful,” Raut said. Shiv Sena MP from South Mumbai Arvind Sawant said that the Centre was harassing the farmers. “It was clearly seen that the son of the union minister of state for home was driving the car. There can’t be a more unfortunate incident than this. Incidents like these are happening frequently. We had opposed the farm laws and had even told the government to change them. The government is behaving in a ruthless manner. We will ensure that the bandh is widespread and successful,” he said. The Bharatiya Kamgar Sena, the Shiv Sens labour wing, has supported Monday’s bandh, as have transporter groups. A transporter said: “Transport fraternity strongly condemns the brutal killings of innocent farmers and we support the bandh. Essentials will be hit.” Mumbai Taximen’s Union leader A L Quadros said he appealed to all cabbies to operate unless there was any kind of threat to them. Some corporators on Sunday started circulating messages among local residents saying a call for Maharashtra Bandh had been given for Monday. Abhishek Ghosalkar, whose wife Tejasvi is a Shiv Sena corporator from IC Colony in Borivli, put out a message that said: “Dear Citizens of I. C. Colony ward # 1, This is to inform all the Citizens of ward # 1,that tomorrow, on the 11th of October 2021, a call for “Maharashtra Bandh” has been given. This is for your information and guidance.” Thane city NCP president Anand Paranjape on Sunday evening issued an appeal to all residents on behalf of the MVA partners to extend their support to the protest.

---||Guwahati||Guwahati: Doctor held for aiding model but gets bail||GUWAHATI: A neurosurgeon, Dr Navanil Barua who had allegedly admitted the 29-year-old model Rajkanya Baruah, accused in a road accident case, to a city-based private hospital on October 3 by signing a “false medical certificate” about a head injury, was arrested by Guwahati police on Sunday after a three-day interrogation on charges of harbouring the model. However, he was granted bail five hours after his arrest. DCP (East), Guwahati, Subrajyoti Bora told TOI that a new case has been registered against the doctor for harbouring the model (IPC 212)), causing disappearance of evidence of offence and or giving false information to screen the offender (IPC 201) and criminal conspiracy under 120B of the IPC. A court here in Guwahati on Friday sent model Rajkanya Baruah, accused in the road accident case, to judicial custody while police questioned the neurosurgeon and the superintendent of the private hospital for allegedly helping her avoid police investigation. Rajkanya skipped police interrogation on Wednesday citing that certificate. On Thursday, the police had arrested her from the ICU of the hospital on the basis of a government medical panel of six doctors, which found her fit to appear before the investigating officers. The police had filed a fresh case against the 29-year-old model, who was allegedly driving in an inebriated state and had knocked down eight roadside workers, injuring one of them seriously. Before entering the interrogation room at Dispur police station, Navanil Barua denied the allegation that he was protecting Rajkanya by issuing false certificates. He, moreover, said he did not even know the accused. “I did not help her. Whatever I did, I did it by following the medical ethics,” the neurosurgeon said. Director general of police (DGP) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta on Saturday said Dr Navanil Barua had called him on the phone on October 4 before the model got arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/doc-held-for-aiding-model-but-gets-bail/articleshow/86921243.cms||Rokibuz Zaman
---||Thiruvananthapuram||In a first, civic body decides to auction off cows||Thiruvananthapuram: Perhaps for the first time, the corporation is set to hold an auction of cows. Reeling from financial loss, the civic body is planning to auction 35 cows which were shifted from a shelter owned by a private trust near Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple to a private farm. In February 2020, the corporation had decided to shift the cows to Vilappilsala following a high court directive to relocate the cows from the shelter near the temple. It was about to face contempt of court proceedings in the case which forced the health standing committee to devise a transportation plan to move the cows from the shelter to a site at Vilappilsala, where a waste treatment plant had functioned earlier. But the decision faced strong protests from local residents. Due to the protests at Vilappilsala, it was decided that the cows shall be transported to a private farm at Kuttichal. There again the corporation had met with some protests but still a team of corporation workers cleaned the farm and made space for 33 cows. The cows were watered to keep them cool and were fed with grass and fodder. The private farm belonged to a local farmer who agreed to house the cows at a fixed rent of Rs 18,000 per month. The council meeting held recently approved an agenda for auctioning the cows citing huge financial liability in taking care of cows. A private party recently expressed interest in taking over the cows, but backed out later. “We have been taking care of the cows for the past one year. Over Rs 30 lakh has already been spent. It is not a financially viable model, besides we have to deploy workers on a daily basis. Auction process will be initiated soon,” said Jameela Sreedharan, chairperson, health standing committee. As per an agenda presented in the council meeting, the cows are now being reared at a private farm in Aryanadu. The corporation had forwarded a letter to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Goshala Trust to remit the amount incurred by corporation so far and take over the cows, however the trust did not reply. It was cited that the corporation incurs an expense of Rs 5,000 per day to maintain the cows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/in-a-first-civic-body-decides-to-auction-off-cows/articleshow/86921262.cms||---

The PI said that they even arranged vehicles for the students to reach their destination in time to appear for the examinations.

Restaurants and shops decided they would “voluntarily” keep shut till 4pm, said office-bearers from the respective trade associations. Transporters said they would support the bandh, which might temporarily hit supply of essentials such as fruits and vegetables. The impact of the bandh is likely to be highest in the Shiv-Sena-dominated areas of central Mumbai as well as in neighbouring Thane, where the MVA constituents have a strong presence. The BEST Kamgar Union affiliated to the Shiv Sena called for a bus bandh and if it is heeded, it could cripple movement in the city at a time when local trains are not accessible to all because of Covid-19 restrictions. About 27 lakh commuters are expected to be affected. Shiv Sena unions have also appealed to auto and taxi drivers to stay off roads, although the leading unions for these two modes of transport said they would not support the bandh. Trains, the metro and aggregator cabs will also ply unless there is protest at stations or on streets, said sources. There will be heavy deployment of police personnel, even at railway stations. Joint anti-sabotage checks of the RPF and GRP, with deployment of the RPF dog squad, have been arranged at sensitive stations and on major trains across the state, said the Western Railway. It said 600 RPF personnel would man stations across the state. “All major stations of the division are deployed with the Quick Response Team,” a spokesperson said. Shiv Sena union leader Suhas Samant claimed that the bus bandh would be “total” in the city and drivers had been asked to join the protest. The rival BEST Workers’ Union led by Shashank Rao said the ruling party should ensure that essential services like buses remain functioning instead of inconveniencing the common man by going off the roads. The BEST administration has appealed to drivers to report to duty and operate buses from 27 bus depots.

It is one of the biggest works undertaken as part of the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee (MGNREGA) scheme in the district. The pond that is spread over 40 cents of land is 50 meters long, 30 meters wide and a depth of 6 feet. Geotextile has also been used to cover the earthen walls of the pond. The work was completed as part of the on-going scheme of the panchayat to create ponds in private plots mainly for fish farming. About 184 ponds have already been created in the panchayat as part of the project. This pond has the capacity to hold 5,000 to 6,000 fishes and was made as per the guidelines from the departments of fisheries and irrigation. The first harvest can be done after eight months. All steps have been taken to ensure the complete success of the farm. Birds have been kept at bay through the use of nets and sheeting. The budget is estimated to be approximately 5 lakhs.  “This is the largest pond ever constructed as part of the MGNREGA in the district. By encouraging and creating ponds for fish cultivation, we hope to enhance fish farming and become self-sufficient in fish production,” said V J Suresh, panchayat president. The idea to make a pond was pitched in by Nidhin M who owns the land. Following the inauguration, carp varieties, including katla, rohu, and tilapia were released into the water. The farm’s profit can be taken by the landowner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/women-dig-farm-pond-for-1071-man-days-in-tholicode/articleshow/86921303.cms||---

It was on 7, May 2020 that Uthra (25) of Anchal was found dead in her bedroom at her house. The prosecution has argued that it was one of the rarest of rare cases as Sooraj (27), the accused, acted barbarically towards his wife and went on to the extent of using snake as a weapon. The prosecution produced 87 witnesses, 288 documents and 40 material evidences, apart from digital evidences. Chavarakavu Suresh, a snake charmer who sold the snake to Sooraj was made an approver in the case. Sooraj had tried to kill Uthra using a viper on March 2, 2020 and it was while she was recovering from the snake bite that Sooraj planned another attempt, again using a snake. In the second time as well when Uthra was bitten by the snake the prosecution said that Sooraj was there in her room. It also argued that the snake could not have entered the room upstairs unless it was let loose. The prosecution also produced evidence to prove that Sooraj had searched on the internet to know about poisonous snakes and their behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/uthra-murder-court-to-pronounce-verdict-today/articleshow/86921341.cms||---

All the revenue inspectors, bill collectors and charge officers were summoned for the meeting and the mayor and senior officials did not mince words to come down heavily on some of the staff of the revenue wing with a tainted past. Names of some of the officials, their past misdeeds in offices where they had previously served were recounted in the meeting leaving the revenue staff flustered. The corporation heads of the standing committee made it clear that the ruling council would not take the blame for their lapses and that they would not even hesitate to order a vigilance probe. Staff members of the Left unions, pro-UDF associations were also present in the meeting. Normally open references to misdemeanour of staff in offices they had earlier served are avoided in meetings, however, this time clear pointers frequently came up in the meeting, apparently in a bid to issue warning to the officials that they are being strongly monitored. As regarding the data cleansing process, status updates from each zonal office were sought. The officials have reportedly assured the ruling council that data regarding tax payments will be updated by October 26. The mayor has told the council that all discrepancies in data pertaining to property tax collection will be updated within 30 days. LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil also reiterated that the corporation will not protect any official responsible for corruption and that it has come to a situation where opposition is targeting the mayor for all the wrongdoings of a few staff. Sources said service history of revenue staff were collected before the meeting and was brought up in front of everyone to make it look like a deterrent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mayor-rebukes-revenue-staff/articleshow/86921401.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: For drug busts in tech age, police still rely on their ‘khabri’ networks||MUMBAI: Hardik reads the morning papers at his Bhuleshwar home while his wife cooks a meal. He then drops his sons at school before heading off to meet someone. Hardik has some big news to share. Later that day, a police team raids an establishment in south Mumbai and recovers a stash of drugs. Hardik checks the newspapers again the following day and pores over a news story about the drug bust. This time, he can afford the vacation his family has long been asking for. The reward for the drug tip-off should be sizable.  The influence of the ‘khabri’ network may have waned with the advent of technology. But for drug busts, drug enforcement agencies, including Mumbai Police, the Narcotics Control Bureau and Customs, still rely substantially on human intelligence. “Technology can support and increase accuracy of human intel but cannot replace it,” says DCP Datta Nalawade of the city anti-narcotics cell (ANC). Typically, anti-drugs law enforcement agencies verify information before carrying out a raid. Often, a confidential informant can help verify the information on ground. “Mumbai has a large number of individuals who make a living out of supplying information to enforcement agencies full-time. They have played a good role in sniffing out drug cases,” said Nalawade.  Many informants live on the fringes of the criminal world themselves. “That is how they gain authentic information,” said a former IPS officer and ace investigator. A good reward is usually the motivation to snitch. The police have a secret fund while national agencies could offer a percentage depending on the recovery. “But money is not always the reason for an insider to go rogue. “At times, a tip-off comes from someone in the drug supply chain who is disgruntled, offended or humiliated. The motivation in this case is revenge,” said the IPS officer.  After getting a basic tip off, a drug enforcement agency may conduct an analysis on how to verify the information on ground. “We look for a weak link in the supply chain and use certain strategies to get details. The other way is to introduce one of our trusted informants into the network. This could prove tricky as we have to ensure he doesn’t break the law while working with criminals nor land into a trap laid by any other drug enforcement agency,” said a senior official. If an informant has to be sent to a pub or into a rave party, drug enforcement agencies have to ensure he looks and dresses the part. “If the informant doesn’t speak the way others at the party do, he would be exposed,” said the officer. Is there a risk to their lives? Nalawade says he cannot recall any ANC informant being harmed. “They usually weigh risk versus reward before deciding which enforcement agency they wish to share information with. It also depends on their rapport with their handler,” says another officer.  A retired officer recalled how drug informants were developed a decade ago. “One of my informants, Salman, was anxious as his wife had suffered serious injuries in a road crash and needed blood. He couldn’t find a donor. When I agreed to donate blood, Salman was relieved. I would remind him thereafter that we now had a ‘bond of blood’ and he should deliver when I needed him to,” the officer recalls.  With amendments to the NDPS Act, drug seizures are now divided into ‘small’ quantities, ‘commercial’ quantities and ‘more than small but less than commercial’ quantities. Penalties are different in each case. “Peddlers are getting smart. They are aware that ‘small’ quantities would get them off the hook sooner. So the trend is to land a larger quantity of drugs outside the peripheries of Mumbai where detection isn’t as swift and then carry small quantities into the city,” said an officer.

---||Lucknow||Up for download: App on ortho ailments related queries||Lucknow: In a push for patients to take more control over their health, a team of experts from the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) have developed a mobile phone application that will answer all queries related to orthopaedic and trauma issues of children. Named ‘Bal Asthi Mitra’, the app was launched on Sunday and will be available for free download at the playstore. Developed by KGMU’s paediatric orthopaedic department, it will also answer queries on club foot, first aid methods, transportation of children to hospital with orthopaedic emergencies and difficulties and the likes. The department in collaboration with the UP Orthopaedic Association (UPOA) also held a state level skill enhancement programme on the use, relevance and importance of the ‘Ponseti technique’ of plaster for clubfoot correction in children. With over 80 participants, the programme aimed at training and educating doctors, nurses and paramedical staff on the technique which can reduce the requirement for surgical correction of clubfoot by more than 80%. “The technique was first used in Uganda in the 1980s and has been in practice ever since but not many expert hands are present to tackle the technicality to perfection, especially in the rural and peripheral areas, from where most patients of clubfoot arise,” said head of KGMU’s paediatric orthopaedic department Prof Ajai Singh. “At KGMU every day, we do over 25 such plasters in the OPD. And if doctors and their staff get well versed with this cost effective method, we can reduce both the requirement for surgery and the risk of a relapse. The success rate is very high with the technique, so if administered very early on, it can cure the child fully and even if brought in late, it can reduce the risk of surgery to a large percentage,” he added. To fill the gap of having the right skill for using the Ponseti technique, KGMU also disseminated its treatment protocol at the conference for a wider knowledge base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-for-download-app-on-ortho-ailments-related-queries/articleshow/86923462.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Fuel prices were hiked again in sync with firming up of international oil prices. Petrol price was hiked by 29 paise per litre and it settled at Rs 100.91 a litre, whereas diesel price was increased by 38 paise per litre and it reached Rs 100.04 a litre on Sunday in Ahmedabad. A price notification of state-owned fuel retailers announced the changes. The sixth straight day of price hike pushed fuel rates to a new record high. Petrol breached the Rs 100/litre mark in Ahmedabad on October 7. Prices differ from state to state depending on local taxes. The surge in prices has not only wrecked the monthly budgets of consumers and commuters but has also left industry stakeholders concerned. Experts say fuel price increase will further cause inflation in relation to all essential commodities including milk, vegetables, and FMCG goods. “A significant surge in fuel prices will only add to the monthly expenditures,” said Milind P, a resident of Vejalpur. “We will see a rise in prices of essential commodities and in the run-up to the festival season, we will have to be frugal.”Petrol and diesel prices began spiking in Ahmedabad since April 15. In nearly six months, fuel prices have shot up 15%. That trend is a big blow to trade and industry players, who are already reeling from a series of cost pressures with the rising raw material prices, cost of coal, and freight charges. Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), said: “An incremental surge in petrol and diesel prices will have an adverse impact on all industries as their transportation costs will go up.” Patwari added: “This will also cause an increase in freight costs. It is high time the government intervenes and reduces the duty and taxes on fuel so that consumers get some relief.” At the same time, the GST Council must make rapid efforts to bring petroleum products under the ambit of GST instead of VAT, he said. He went on to say: “That will help industries claim input tax credit on fuel, which often accounts for a major chunk of operating expenditure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diesel-crosses-rs-100/l-mark/articleshow/86921449.cms||Niyati Parikh

Every year, the Ramleela is held at Gandhinagar and attracts many people from across Nashik. Kapil Dev Sharma, secretary of Sri Ramleela Samiti in Gandhinagar that organizes the event, said the Covid-induced restrictions have affected the play. However, he promised to come up with a bigger show next year. “We have been promised a bigger stage and we intend to bring in more modern equipment to add more interest in the play. We may have missed it this year, but we will be back with a bang next year,” Sharma said. The seventh day of the event used to be the most exciting when Lord Hanuman arrived on the stage with the “vaanar Ssna”. “Children with red paint on their face and artificial tails made a good picture for the audience. The way these children — part of Lord Ram’s army — attacked the Ravan sena, who were not allowed to react, was hilarious,” Ansh Mehta, a Class X student who saw the event in the past, said. While the children have their reasons, the elders used to gather to see the performance put up by amateur artists. “In the past, there was Liaqat Pathan who would play the role of Sita. The Gandhinagar Ramleela is nothing but a source of inspiration for all the budding artists and also a stepping stone for actors. Many local artists have played some or the other character here,” said 60-year-old Raju Bhadekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-residents-miss-ramleela-due-to-covid-for-second-year-in-a-row/articleshow/86917619.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Singh was speaking at a meeting of the minority wing in the state capital on Sunday. “Netagiri ka matlab lootne nahi aaye hain...Fortuner se kisi ko kuchalne nahi aaye hain,” he told a gathering at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee convention centre. His statement was perceived as an expression of annoyance within the party leadership over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident that allowed the Opposition to train guns at the ruling party. #WATCH | Lucknow: #UP BJP chief #SwatantraDevSingh says, "A tea seller, born in a poor family, became a CM, PM.

Parents have been raising concerns related to the change in behaviour of their children due to the Covid-induced disruptions to their daily routines. Queries range from phone addiction, concentration to anxiety. The state child rights commission will also launch a mental health awareness campaign from next month. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Right (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, "We have been getting reports about all sorts of issues being faced by children which includes addiction to mobile phones, anxiety, labour and even assault. Due to the lockdown, we could not organise a campaign, but now as things are normalising, we will conduct programmes at the grassroot-level." "The aim is to take the awareness campaign to parents and children who do not have access to digital media," she said.

---||Mumbai||Cruise drugs case: Nigerian and a local held for peddling in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), probing the cruise liner drug seizure case, on Sunday arrested two peddlers, including a foreign national. The two were identified as Shivraj Harijan (33), a Santacruz (West) resident, and Nigerian national Okara Ouzama. NCB claimed that Harijan’s name cropped up during interrogations of accused Arbaaz Merchant and from Harijan they recovered 62 grams of charas near Rajesh Khanna Garden in Santacruz (West). NCB also recovered an intermediate quantity of cocaine from Ouzama, said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB. Wankhede, in a press release, said nine independent witnesses were involved in the whole cruise liner operation, Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi among them. Neither of these two was known to NCB officials before the raid last Saturday, he said in the release. Public prosecutor Advait Sethna told the holiday court that the investigation was at a nascent stage. Harjian’s lawyer, Sandeep Sherkhane, told the court that his client has been falsely implicated. “NCB has failed to show his link with co-accused Arbaaz Merchant. Harjian was picked up while he was chatting with his friends.” The court granted one day’s custody of Harijan. Ouzama will be produced before the court on Monday. NCB claims that Harijan, as well as the Nigerian national, are drug suppliers for Merchant, and hence they need to be questioned. The NDPS court is likely to hear accused Aryan Khan’s bail application on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cruise-case-nigerian-and-a-local-held-for-peddling-in-mumbai/articleshow/86924349.cms||Ahmed Ali

They have been conceived by Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) and sent to the state government for approval. LAPs for more than 70km of transit-oriented zone (TOZ) corridors were being prepared since 2015. These LAPs incentivize redevelopment —pulling down old societies and commercial complexes to give way to new development. The plans will promote compact development by increasing the existing Floor Space Index (FSI) from 1.8 to 4.0. “Apart from the raised FSI, we have identified additional land to be taken into public Right of Way (ROW) to add new streets and to improve pedestrian connectivity,” said a senior AUDA official. He added: “We have also provisioned for increased green areas along public pathways. This will enhance accessibility through direct connectivity with BRTS and the upcoming Metro.” Senior AUDA officials said that special development regulations to improve public spaces built along the transit corridors are being drafted. These moot features such as arcades, plazas, and public amenities near transit stations. Earlier AUDA’s Comprehensive Development Plan for 2021 had kept its focus on compact and sustainable development. It had identified 400m wide corridors along the public transit corridor like the BRTS and the metrorail route, which is a TOZ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-west-gets-green-plan-to-boost-access/articleshow/86921507.cms||---

In April this year, the positivity rate here had increased to 35%, but subsequently dropped to 1%. According to the officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), they have now also increased the number of daily Covid tests from 4,000 to 6,000. On Friday, 6,279 tests were conducted in the city at civic and private hospitals, and 31 patients had tested positive —reflecting a positivity rate 0.49%. On Saturday, 4,799 tests were conducted and only 22 patients were found with the infection, which shows a positivity rate of 0.45%. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of the NMC, said the coronavirus has become milder and infectivity has reduced. Moreover, the vaccination of residents has also increased. The city had reported only 500 active cases in the first week of February this year, but there had been a spike later. The number of new cases started increasing from March onwards. The number of active cases had increased to 28,000 by April 23, 2021.

The SIT found Ashish "evasive" about his whereabouts at the time of the incident following which he was arrested on Saturday night. A medical team examined him in the crime branch office. He was then taken to a judicial magistrate who sent him to custody, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said. Ashish was also not able to explain the presence of empty cartridges in his vehicle. A forensic team had visited the site of the alleged killings in Banbirpur on Wednesday and recovered two empty .315 cartridges from Ashish’s vehicle. Ashish has been accused of shooting at farmers. The cartridges have been sent for a forensic examination. The minister's son is currently housed in a ‘quarantine cell’ at Lakhimpur district jail as per Covid protocol. He had skipped summons by the SIT on Friday, after which a second notice had been issued asking him to appear. According to the SIT, Ashish was unable to prove why his SUV (Thar) and a Fortuner, registered in the name of his friend, Ankit Das, were headed towards the protest site, despite police blocking the route for traffic and asking commuters to follow another. The administration had changed the route of deputy CM Keshav Maurya’s convoy and alerted BJP functionaries in the area about it after farmers planned a protest at the Maharaja Agrasen Sports Ground helipad where Mishra and Maurya were to address an event. Ashish had claimed that the SUV which mowed down farmers was driven by his driver Hari Om Mishra and that he was not in it. "During questioning, Ashish said he was at a wrestling event in Banbirpur village, 4 km from where the incident took place, and left the spot later to visit a rice mill. But he was not able to give satisfactory answers when he was asked about his location between 2.36pm and 4pm,” a member of the SIT team told TOI. The Lakhimpur incident took place at about 3.03pm. “There is clear evidence that Ashish was not present at the wrestling event at the time of the incident. We need to question him more and take him to the main site (of crime) for investigation. We will seek further remand on Monday,” said the SIT official. CCTV footage from the area is being scanned by experts. A senior police officer added that witnesses have told cops they saw Ashish at a petrol pump near the scene of violence when he came to tank up his vehicle, just a few minutes before some farmers were mowed down. Meanwhile, a forensic team accompanied by officials from the SIT visited the crime spot again on Sunday. Residents in nearby areas, too, were questioned. ADG (Lucknow zone) S N Sabat told TOI, “Since this is an important case, experts were sent from Lucknow. They will recreate the crime scene.” Sources privy to the probe said forensic examination of the entire area where the killings happened would be done and videos of the episode processed "to zero in on the location of the key accused". Ashish’s counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh said they would apply for bail on Monday. “We will oppose the police's appeal for remand custody. We have sufficient evidence to prove that Ashish was at the wrestling competition. There were thousands of people there.” (Inputs by Pathikrit Chakraborty)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-in-14-day-judicial-custody-as-sit-asks-about-bullet-shells-location/articleshow/86919712.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He said UP is governed by a chief minister and a party which talks of only one religion and community. The Hyderabad MP also accused the government of handling the accused in Lakhimpur case with kid gloves as they were Brahmins and the BJP wants to keep the community in good humour because of the elections. “Inhone koi qasar baaqi nahi rakhi ki Bharat ke samvidhan ki dhajjiyan urdai jayen. Inhone koi qasar baaqi nahi rakhi ke sirf ek hi mazhab ki, ek hi tabque ki, ek hi zaat biradari ki baat karein (He (Yogi government) has spared no attempt to make a mockery of the Indian constitution. He has spared no attempt to talk about only one religion, one community and one caste and clan) Owaisi said while addressing a “Soshit, vanchit samaj sammelan” in Balrampur. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief cited statistics to claim that the government was targeting Muslims in the name of police encounters. Earlier in Lucknow, Owaisi attacked the BJP for the death of farmers who were mowed down by the jeep owned by the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni in Lakhimpur. Objecting to the word ‘incident’ being used for the violence, Owaisi described it as a premeditated conspiracy and murder. “In BJP, nothing happens without the nod of RSS and BJP bosses. It is not like any other party where things can happen on the spur of the moment,” the Hyderabad MP said. The AIMIM chief said it was well known that Teni had threatened the protesting farmers and openly said that he can teach them a lesson and then the farmers were mowed down by the vehicle owned by the minister. Questioning the police action, he said while the minister’s son was in police custody, he was served refreshments 10 times in 12 hours. “The way he was being taken care of by the police, it appeared he was not a murder accused but a sought after man who has come to visit his in-laws,” Owaisi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-cares-for-only-1-religion-1-community-owaisi/articleshow/86923561.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Will ensure budget allocation to pay sugarcane dues, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Lambasting the BJP government for depriving farmers of their rights, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said if voted to power, his government would create a separate budget allocation for payment of cane farmers’ dues. Addressing a public meeting in Saharanpur, he also promised construction of a four-lane highway from Shamli to Muzaffarnagar in west UP. Accusing the BJP of trying every trick to humiliate farmers, he said people associated with the government were behind Lakhimpur Kheri incident where farmers were crushed to death under the wheels of a jeep belonging to “the BJP (leader’s son) and the government”. “They have not only crushed farmers to death but have also trampled the law of the land,” he said. Referring to the statements of BJP leaders who have described the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders a handiwork of mobsters, the SP chief said that the government had been humiliating farmers by calling them names. “If they have their way, they would call you terrorists as well. I congratulate the farmers who are leading the protest with patience and perseverance. They have not lost their cool and are determined to fight to the finish,” he said. Calling on the people to vote out the BJP in the 2022 assembly elections, Akhilesh said if people could vote a party to power, their vote had the strength to remove those who were not performing well. “People will change the government which only believes in changing names,” he said. “The countdown of the present government will begin after the festival season. A panditji (priest), who was a fellow passenger onboard a flight, told me that this time my party will win 350 seats. I asked him to add one more from my side and put the figure at 351,” Akhilesh said amid applause from supporters. Recalling the contribution of SP MP Chaudhary Yashpal Singh on his birth centenary, Akhilesh said he was a leader who had the courage to fight for the rights and honour of the farmers and the poor. “I am confident that people who follow him will rise up to the occasion and bring the society together to fight for their rights,” he said. Meanwhile, SP leader Prof Sudhir Panwar said that by accepting the demand to make budgetary provision for payment of cane dues to farmers, the party president had shown that only his party was dedicated to the farmers’ cause.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-create-budget-allocation-for-canedues-payment-if-voted-to-power-akhilesh/articleshow/86923579.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The seven-year-old boy survived and is being treated at a public hospital. The police said the woman was going through marital trouble. Banu More, the deceased, lived in Kalwa with her son, Amit. Her husband had married twice, police said. Early on Saturday, More got into an Up CSMT bound local from Kalwa with her son.

---||Lucknow||Need to create water sanctuaries to save humanity||Floodplains and a forested river-corridor along the rivers provide a natural filter to help purify, rejuvenate and restock our water supply. Flooding is part of the natural cycle and it redeems our soil, ecology and groundwater. Flows in perennial rivers depend heavily on groundwater systems. If the land along the river banks is protected, we not only get a water positive river basin, but also ensure resilience against climate change. Floodplains can be earmarked as ‘water sanctuaries’ and planned to store water for at least a century. Tropical rivers like ours swell manifolds during the monsoon and need areas to spread water and sediments. The periodic cycles of floods and droughts have been going on since rivers started flowing. The cyclic pattern of monsoon itself is a 15 million-year old phenomenon. A natural floodplain along the rivers withstands flooding and helps in recharging water-deficient aquifers. One of the main purposes of protecting floodplains as water sanctuary is to improve recharging of water resources and ensure sustainability of water-dependent ecosystems – including survival of human beings. Rivers and their connected landscapes are part of our natural heritage. They have taken millions of years to evolve and come to their current form. With the upsurge of Himalayas, a vast depression was made between the peninsular region and the Himalayas. This depression was filled up with sand and clay from the Ganga and many of its tributaries. Thus, a vast reservoir of freshwater was created in the form of large aquifer systems beneath the Ganga alluvial plain. The aquifer systems of the Ganga basin are the biggest storehouse of groundwater in the world. The irony is that it is the most heavily irrigated region in the world with the largest withdrawal of groundwater. About 3,60,000 square kilometres of Ganga basin is irrigated, amounting to about 57% of India’s total net irrigated area. Much of this irrigation demand is met from groundwater. While we talk about annual groundwater table decline in a few centimetres or inches, in reality it could mean a steady large‐scale mass loss for the entire basin in hundreds of cubic kilometres. This can dehydrate groundwater dependent ecosystems. Groundwater is our lifeline. It makes our ponds, wetlands and rivers flow. We get rains only for a few days; it is the recharge to the aquifers that gradually yields back to water bodies. This precious groundwater is nurtured in the floodplains, along the rivers and in the forest. Therefore, like protected forests and national parks, we need water sanctuaries as protected landscapes for recharging rainwater. This is best done naturally as nature has marked special recharge zones through thousands of years of natural cycles – best sites are river terraces, floodplains, ponds and forests. A natural floodplain improves water quality, conditions the soil and nurtures plants and animals. The water that reaches the rivers and lakes is in better condition, and part of a healthier environment. A good coverage of vegetation acts as a refuge to wildlife and improves habitats. Protecting water bodies is important in cities and towns but also vital is protection of their watersheds. The Ganga is about 2525km long and its flood terrace is vast. The wetlands on the fringes of Ganga are one of the most productive ecosystems, cleaning and regulating water systems while providing a home for a variety of aquatic plants and wildlife. On a conservative estimate, if 500 metres along both banks are left as no-development zones, it can store huge amount of freshwater. Hundreds of smaller rivers and tributaries of Ganga can also be declared as water sanctuaries. This will ensure a water-positive society, restore rivers, revitalize ecology and sustain biodiversity.

We plan to hold a meeting with the state government soon. Our demand is that we need time to install the required fire safety equipment at schools,” said Bhaskar Patel, president of Gujarat State School Management Association. He said that the fire equipment cost about Rs 3.5 lakh and since majority of the 260-odd schools that have been recently served closure notice by AMC are grant-in aid schools having limited financial resources, they should be given more time to comply. Also, a large number of these schools are run out of rented premises so availing necessary permission from their landlords for fire safety equipment installation is time consuming, he further said. “If the government is not willing to look into our proposal, we will ask the government to take over these schools and run it themselves,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fire-safety-norms-schools-seek-time/articleshow/86921551.cms||---

In a span of one month, 75 people suffering from fever with dengue-like symptoms have died in the district, according to the health department sources. Out of these, 60 were children. The health department sources confirmed 270 dengue cases in Agra district till Sunday afternoon. Health officials estimated that more than 5,000 people suffering from fever were bed-ridden at home in rural areas as the government-run medical centres had run out of beds. A majority of them were at the mercy of quacks for treatment. Santosh Singh of Sarai Jairam village said, “My 10-month-old son was suffering from fever for the last four days. We got medicines for him from a private clinic as no doctor was available at the government centre. On Thursday evening, his condition deteriorated. He died on the way to SN Medical College (SNMC).” Virendra Singh of Modipura village under Pihanat block said, “Majority of the people suffering high fever are dependent on quacks as the government centres are full and are not admitting any more patients.” Arun Kumar Srivastava, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “Health department teams are conducting door-to-door surveys in rural areas to identify patients suffering fever and ensuring their required treatment. Medical camps are also being organized in the affected areas. Cleanliness work and anti-larvae spraying is being done at the villages to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. Strict action will be taken against the quacks. All the cases of deaths are being investigated”. The CMO also confirmed a spurt in diarrhoea cases at government centres and said children were worst- affected.

---||Lucknow||Paying Rs 450 wages per month is a form of forced labour, says HC||Prayagraj: Holding that the payment of Rs 450 per month to an employee as wages is clearly a form of forced labour and is violative of Article 23 of the Constitution, the Allahabad High Court has directed the Director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, MD Eye Hospital, Prayagraj, to pay the minimum wages as prescribed in the state of Uttar Pradesh from June 15, 2001, the date of initial appointment of the petitioner within four months after deducting the amount paid to him till date. Article 23 of the Constitution provides right against exploitation and prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour and makes any contravention of this provision an offence punishable in accordance with law. Allowing a writ petition filed by one Tufail Ahmad Ansari, Justice Pankaj Bhatia directed the Director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, MD Eye Hospital, Prayagraj, to pass order in respect of the regularisation of the petitioner within four months, as he had been working prior to December 31, 2001 and as per the 2016 rule of the state government, he is entitled to regularisation. The writ petition was filed stating that the petitioner has been working as an employee in Director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, MD Eye Hospital, Prayagraj, since June 15, 2001 on a class-IV post and is being paid wages at the rate of Rs. 450 per month since his initial engagement. It was also stated that despite the petitioner being entitled for being considered for regularisation as per 2016 Rules, the case of the petitioner is not being considered. After hearing the counsel for the petitioner and state government counsel, the court allowed the petition, observing, “In the instructions of the state government, it is admitted that the wages of Rs. 450 per month being paid to the petitioner are not the minimum wages prescribed in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This court is unable to fathom as to how the state can continue the exploitation of class-IV post employees for about 20 years on the strength of government order (GO), which has been relied upon by the UP government counsel in support of his contention. If the stand of the state counsel is accepted, this court would also be guilty of ignoring the plight of class-IV persons who are being exploited by the state.”The court delivered this judgment on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/paying-rs-450-wages-per-month-is-a-form-of-forced-labour-says-hc/articleshow/86923673.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The SIT found Ashish "evasive" about his whereabouts at the time of the incident following which he was arrested on Saturday night. A medical team examined him in the crime branch office. He was then taken to a judicial magistrate who sent him to custody, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said. Ashish was also not able to explain the presence of empty cartridges in his vehicle. A forensic team had visited the site of the alleged killings in Banbirpur on Wednesday and recovered two empty .315 cartridges from Ashish’s vehicle. Ashish has been accused of shooting at farmers. The cartridges have been sent for a forensic examination. The minister's son is currently housed in a ‘quarantine cell’ at Lakhimpur district jail as per Covid protocol. He had skipped summons by the SIT on Friday, after which a second notice had been issued asking him to appear. According to the SIT, Ashish was unable to prove why his SUV (Thar) and a Fortuner, registered in the name of his friend, Ankit Das, were headed towards the protest site, despite police blocking the route for traffic and asking commuters to follow another. The administration had changed the route of deputy CM Keshav Maurya’s convoy and alerted BJP functionaries in the area about it after farmers planned a protest at the Maharaja Agrasen Sports Ground helipad where Mishra and Maurya were to address an event. Ashish had claimed that the SUV which mowed down farmers was driven by his driver Hari Om Mishra and that he was not in it. "During questioning, Ashish said he was at a wrestling event in Banbirpur village, 4 km from where the incident took place, and left the spot later to visit a rice mill. But he was not able to give satisfactory answers when he was asked about his location between 2.36pm and 4pm,” a member of the SIT team told TOI. The Lakhimpur incident took place at about 3.03pm. “There is clear evidence that Ashish was not present at the wrestling event at the time of the incident. We need to question him more and take him to the main site (of crime) for investigation. We will seek further remand on Monday,” said the SIT official. CCTV footage from the area is being scanned by experts. A senior police officer added that witnesses have told cops they saw Ashish at a petrol pump near the scene of violence when he came to tank up his vehicle, just a few minutes before some farmers were mowed down. Meanwhile, a forensic team accompanied by officials from the SIT visited the crime spot again on Sunday. Residents in nearby areas, too, were questioned. ADG (Lucknow zone) S N Sabat told TOI, “Since this is an important case, experts were sent from Lucknow. They will recreate the crime scene.” Sources privy to the probe said forensic examination of the entire area where the killings happened would be done and videos of the episode processed "to zero in on the location of the key accused". Ashish’s counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh said they would apply for bail on Monday. “We will oppose the police's appeal for remand custody. We have sufficient evidence to prove that Ashish was at the wrestling competition. There were thousands of people there.” (Inputs by Pathikrit Chakraborty)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-mins-son-in-14-day-judicial-custody-as-sit-asks-about-bullet-shells-location/articleshow/86919835.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Rainfall which is 60% higher than normal is abnormal rainfall,” said a senior officer of Jaipur Met office on Sunday. Rajasthan, which usually gets an average rainfall of 526.62mm, received 588.82mm this year. “The state’s average rainfall of this season is almost 11.8% higher compared to what it usually receives. This is mainly due to the extended monsoon rainfall,” the officer added. Kota received 1144.44mm rains, the highest among all districts. The good rainfall has given a new lease of life to the reservoirs across the state. Bisalpur dam that caters to the drinking water needs of Tonk, Ajmer and Jaipur is now almost 50% filled. “When monsson started, it was merely 16% filled. But now it has adequate water to cater to the drinking water needs of Tonk, Ajmer and Jaipur for a year,” weathermen said. Meanwhile, the deprture of the monsoon has led to the mercury taking an upward swing across the state. At majority of the places, there was a rise of almost 4°C in maximum temperatures. However, minimum temperatures is witnessing a gradual dip in the early morning hours. “For onset of winters, the minimum temperatures will first start dipping. It appears that in next fortnight, many places in the state would witness winters especially Churu, Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-receives-11-8-more-rains-this-year/articleshow/86923718.cms||---
---||Lucknow||2 yrs on, rape survivor awaits aid||Lucknow: She aspired to become a police officer but the poor financial condition of her family forced her to take up the job of a kindergarten teacher at a private school in Shikohabad on a meagre salary of Rs 3,000 per month in 2019. Months later, the girl, then 16, was repeatedly gangraped by the school principal and his relative, who was also a teacher in the school. She got pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl. The survivor, who lives in a rented accommodation with her mother and younger brother in Tundla (Firozabad), made several requests to the state government for financial aid, following which the district magistrate met her twice and recommended financial support of Rs 7.5 lakh under Rani Laxmi Bai Mahila Samman Kosh. Two years have passed but the family is yet to receive the aid. Losing all hopes of financial support, the family made its ends meet by stitching clothes. The survivor completed her graduation while her mother did her masters in sociology. Now, the mother-daughter duo are searching for job to make their lives better. “My daughter is now 20 months old and I still find it difficult to arrange milk for her. She is weak but somehow she survived. I can’t say what will be our future. My mother and I have completed our education. We have lost all hopes of government aid and we are looking for job,” the survivor, now 18, said. Talking to TOI, the survivor’s mother said, “After the incident, our landlord forced us to leave the rented accommodation. We shifted to a cheaper accommodation. Stitching clothes helped us sustain the family. Government aid would be a big help to us but every time we enquire about the status of our application, we don’t get a satisfactory response.” Director, state women and child development department, Manoj Rai said he had directed the officers concerns to share the status of the applications. “Within 10 days, the amount will be transferred to the survivor’s account. She won’t have to suffer further,” he said. Former CWC member (Lucknow) Sangeeta Sharma said, “There are many rape survivors whose funds are yet to be released by the department. In Lucknow, a four-year-old girl, who was raped few years ago, is yet to receive aid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-yrs-on-rape-survivor-awaits-aid/articleshow/86923697.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Elusive caracal spotted in Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary||JAIPUR: Photographic evidence of the endangered caracal has been reported from the Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. It is the country's second wildcat species facing the threat of extinction after cheetahs. The presence of the medium-sized wild cat, which is shy, nocturnal, elusive and difficult to spot in the wild, was recorded at a private resort situated approximately 1.5km away from the sanctuary. DFO Fateh Singh Rathore said, “This is approximately after three decades that a caracal has been spotted in the sanctuary. Last year, the forest staff claimed they had spotted one. However, there was no concrete evidence. Today, the caracal was captured by the camera. It’s a good sign as it indicates the sanctuary has appropriate grassland.” Last year in December, a report published in the international ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’ said there has been a total of 24 caracal sightings reported since 2001, claimed to be highest in the country. But it could not ascertain the current population in Rajasthan. It is largely observed that these elusive wildcats prefer dry deciduous forest with water bodies having severely eroded river banks, adjacent to ravine habitats. Also, they inhabit dry, arid regions and moist woodlands. They are protected under Schedule (I) of the Indian Wildlife Act for being critically endangered due to the loss of habitat in many states. Resort owner Vikramaditya Singh Rathore said, “In the past, the elusive cat has been reported from the region of Kumbhalgarh-Todgarh-Raoli in Udaipur. As we have planted only native species of trees and grasses, the place appears to be like a forest. Luckily, we spotted the caracal at our resort.” In Rajasthan, other than Ranthambore and contiguous areas, including Dholpur, the cat has been seen in the region of Udaipur as well as an isolated population in Chittorgarh-Pratapgarh area. It has been stated that this scrub-dwelling species may still be present in states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and eastern parts of India, but are not being reported. “The caracal is a native of Africa, Middle-East, Central Asia and India, listed in the IUCN Red List as a threatened species,” a forest official said. The cat has tufts of hair at the end of the ear. They are nocturnal, agile, fighters, elusive, good hunters and found in small herds. It hunts rodents and game birds with amazing speed and dexterity. “It can jump three metres in one leap and has paws shaped like a cheetah’s. It can be easily recognised by its long pointed ears that end in tufts,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/elusive-caracal-spotted-in-kumbhalgarh-sanctuary/articleshow/86923731.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Constable arrested for murder of wife’s lover||MUMBAI: The city crime branch has arrested a police constable and his wife and claimed to have cracked the murder of a man from Solapur whose headless body was found outside the CGS quarters at Antop Hill last month. The constable, Shivshankar Gaikwad (40), suspected that his wife Monali was in a relationship with the deceased prompting him to plan the murder. The accused frequently fought with his wife over this issue. He called the deceased, Arjun Jagdale, a chilli trader from Akluj in Solapur on the pretext of discussing the issue and killed him. On sustained interrogations Monali spilled the beans. She told police that after calling Jagdale home, Gaikwad served him liquor and when he was in an inebriated condition, he stabbed him with a knife while their two daughters were away. He later chopped his body and packed it in the plastic bags and dumped it in Antop Hill. Police believe Monali helped her husband in chopping the body and packing it in the plastic bag and loading it into their car. Police have seized the weapon and the car and have sent it to forensic experts. Police have also collected the DNA and blood stain samples from Gaikwad’s house. Gaikwad has not given clarity on how he killed Jagdale and where he dumped his head. Prima facie it appears that Monali, who also hails from Solapur district, was having an affair with the deceased. Gaikwad used to work as a police driver for an ACP in Sion division. Both were produced before the holiday court and were remanded to 14 days police custody. On September 29, the Antop Hill police were informed about a suspicious plastic bag lying behind a building at Sector 7 at CGST quarters. Police opened the bag to find the headless body of a male. The body was packed in two bags and then put into a plastic bag and wrapped in a bed sheet. The body parts were finely chopped into several pieces leaving no traces of identity except the gender. The body was sent for post mortem and the crime branch unit 4 started a parallel probe. The biggest challenge of the police was to identify the deceased. “Our first priority was to identify the deceased so we checked with the description of missing persons reported in various police stations across the city, Thane and Navi Mumbai. Another team was examining CCTV footage to trace the person who dumped the body parts at CGS quarters,” said an officer. Police got a blurred number plate off a silver Wagon R car passing and stopping at the spot. During the post mortem of the body parts a steel plate was found fitted in the ankle of his left leg. “There were seven holes on the plate. We traced its manufacturer and zeroed in on 41 people who had fitted similar plates in their legs due to injuries caused by various accidents,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-constable-arrested-for-murder-of-wifes-lover/articleshow/86924383.cms||Ahmed Ali

Kannan was driving a car on Thirupathur- Sivaganga road when the bus coming in the opposite direction collided with it, killing him on the spot. His family members moved the motor accidents claims tribunal for compensation. The tribunal directed the transport corporation to pay Rs 17.07lakh as compensation to the victim’s family members as the accident happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the bus driver. It was also asked to pay Rs 40,000 to the car owner who also sought compensation. The transport corporation challenged both the orders before HC Madurai bench. The standing counsel for the transport corporation submitted that the bus driver had stated that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the car driver against whom a criminal case was also registered. Without considering these facts, the tribunal had erroneously fixed negligence on the bus driver, he said. A division bench of Justices V Bharathidasan and J Nisha Banu observed that an eyewitness to the accident had clearly stated that the accident had occurred due to the negligence of the bus driver. The evidence of the bus driver cannot be taken into consideration as he is an interested witness. The transport corporation did not examine any of the passengers on the bus to prove that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the deceased. Therefore, the judges said the tribunal had rightly fixed the negligence on the part of the bus driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-relief-for-kin-of-accident-victim/articleshow/86921684.cms||---

Bala, 31, picked up an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury during her stint with Rangers FC and was operated on September 3. Full recoveries can take anywhere between four and seven months. The India striker remains confident of a comeback, though coach Thomas Dennerby isn’t entirely sure. “Good players are always part of your plan, but we also need to be very realistic,” Dennerby told reporters during an online interaction on Monday. “I think her surgery was in the beginning of September. The quickest recovery ever I heard about after ACL injury is about four and half, five months. Some players can take upto six to nine months. “We really don’t know. If she is 100 percent fit, of course, we want to have the best players, but we also need to be realistic and plan without her. We will see in a couple of weeks how the rehabilitation is going.” India are preparing for the AFC Asian Cup 2022 which will be played with 12 teams for the first time, four more than the last four editions. The tournament will be played in Mumbai and Pune from January 20 to February 6. Bala is India’s first women footballer to sign a professional contract, and score, in Europe. She is the country’s best bet in front of goal too, having scored 52 goals in 58 matches between 2010 and 2019, when she last represented the country. She scored both goals in India’s 2-0 win over Nepal in the South Asian Games final, her last international assignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-players-are-always-part-of-our-plan-but-we-have-to-be-realistic-about-bala-devi-dennerby/articleshow/86949192.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The move has left over 20,000 students vying for admission in AKTU affiliated colleges and 13 state universities in a fix. The postponement of the counselling is likely to delay the session by 15 more days. Already the academic session in engineering, pharmacy and professional courses institute is delayed by three months due to the pandemic. AKTU has informed the NTA about the discrepancies and has ordered an investigation after which the counselling will resume. The admission of candidates who have done physical reporting and paid fees in engineering and pharmacy colleges has been put on hold till a fresh merit list is announced. “During counselling it was found that the names of two or more candidates are on the same rank despite different scores. After such discrepancies were noticed in the merit list announced by the NTA we have immediately stopped the counseling,” said AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra. He said now we will start counselling process after these flaws are rectified. Since after rectification the ranks of the candidates are expected to change hence we may have to cancel the admission done through the first round of counselling, he added. “The reconciliation will be done when the process starts again and the admissions which are found to be valid among them will be continued, the rest will be cancelled,” he said. BOX 90% LU engineering seats filled Meanwhile, around 90% of seats have been filled at Lucknow University’s faculty of engineering and now all of them will have to wait for re-counselling. In the first round of counselling, 432 seats out of a total of 498 seats in Computer Science and Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering in Artificial Intelligence, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and Electrical Engineering have been filled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aktu-stops-counseling-after-discrepancies-in-merit-list/articleshow/86923729.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The unfolding events reached a crescendo on stage when Parshuram and Ram cross paths in the forests and the Brahmin warrior challenges the Ayodhya prince to break another celestial bow after effortlessly lifting Lord Shiva’s bow to woo Sita in the ‘swayamvar’. Parshuram’s rage and fury was best exemplified by Kishan in this scene on Sunday. Despite his commitments in politics and cinema, he found enough time to rehearse his role before going on stage for the Ramleela, which is being streamed live across the world through Doordarshan and other social media platforms. The Gorakhpur legislator told reporters it was his biggest privilege to enact the Ramleela in Ayodhya, the city of Maryada Purushottam Ram. “I began with acting in village Ramleelas and have come a long way to be able to perform in Ayodhya. I consider myself fortunate to be performing in Ram’s shelter,” he said. Director of Ramleela, Subhash Malik, said, “Bhojpuri superstar and member of Parliament Ravi Kishan left Ram bhakts spellbound in his role of Parshuram. Another Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari will enact the role of Angada, Vindu Dara Singh will be seen in the role of Hanuman and singer Malini Awasthi will be seen in the role of Shabri.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ravi-kishan-enthrals-in-his-parshuram-avatar-in-ayodhya-ramleela/articleshow/86923708.cms||---

While the wait for their formal anointment as members of the HDMC Council continues, the oversight in segregating the new wards in the 12 zones had added to the residents’ infuriation. Santosh Chavan, elected to the HDMC Council for the first time from ward 41, said that a flurry of calls from aggrieved residents had followed the declaration of the election results. “We are relaying their problems to the control room, and in some cases, we are intimating the HDMC commissioner too. The HDMC officials are addressing the problems, but I think the authorities must expedite the process of segregating the wards into the 12 zones,” Chavan said. Sources in the HDMC hinted at reservations among the senior officials about adding more wards to their zones, which would translate to an increase in their responsibilities, which they would find hard to shoulder given the staff crunch that the civic body is grappling with. “Posts of junior engineers, health inspectors, et al are lying vacant. Although the number of wards has increased, no steps have been taken to ensure a proportional rise in personnel. We are in no position to assure the newly-elected corporators that these issues will be resolved in time, given the problem of staff shortage,” a HDMC official said. Sources added that the elected representatives and the officials were pulling in different directions as far as segregation of the wards into the 12 zones was concerned. Officials, meanwhile, are eager to ensure the entire system is streamlined before the mayoral polls. Former mayor Veerana Savadi, elected from Ward 46, said that the division of the wards among the zones had not been carried out in a scientific manner. “Nearly 80% of my ward has been placed under the jurisdiction of Zone 6, while the remaining part of the segment will fall under the purview of Zone 5. This will lead to confusion when it comes to supply of water and allocation of funds for development projects. The officials must address these problems, and complete the process at the earliest,” Savadi said. ‘There will continue to be 12 zonal areas’ We are segregating and assigning property identification to each ward. The process will be completed in a matter of days. We will continue to have 12 zones. We will distribute our existing staff to work in each ward. We have only 40 health inspectors, although there are enough engineers and bill collectors. We will outsource some of the work to combat the staff crunch, for which I will seek approval from the government. - Suresh Itnal | Commissioner, Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/delay-in-dividing-wards-among-12-zones-adds-to-confusion-in-twin-cities/articleshow/86919877.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Three of them died on the spot while the fourth is battling for his life. According to the police, the car in which the four friends were travelling crashed into a divider, lost control and collided with a DCM truck which was passing by in the Chhapar area. The truck driver was also hurt and sent to a local hospital, cops added. The deceased have been identified as Sailesh Kumar, 26, a resident of Rajouri Garden. He worked as a field officer in a Delhi-based marketing firm. His cousin Sudhir Kumar, 28, was a cab driver. Thirty-year-old Ajay Singh belonged to Raghuveer Colony and worked at a private firm. Sailesh's brother, Pardeep Kumar, told TOI, "My brother got married a year ago and left a month-old baby girl behind. Sudhir was supposed to get married soon after Diwali." Hearing a loud bang, locals reached the accident site and found the mangled remains of the car and the truck a few metres away. The cops were informed. They sent the victims to a district hospital. Three of them were declared brought dead, while the fourth, Harsh Kumar, is said to be critical. The bodies were sent for postmortem and later handed over to their families for the last rites, police said, adding that the families are yet to lodge a formal complaint.

---||Dehradun||Vax hesitancy holds back Doon inoculation drive||Dehradun: Even after two devastating Covid-19 waves and despite large-scale awareness camps run by the district administration, vaccine hesitancy is still prevalent among many people. 38-year-old Bina, who works as domestic help, said, “I had no plans to get jabbed but I got the first vaccine dose after losing my husband to Covid-19 in April. However, I have heard that just one dose will protect me against Covid-19 as well. I, now, have to work twice as hard to provide for my two kids. I don’t have the time to get the second dose.” Thankfully, this vaccine hesitancy hasn’t really started to reflect in the district’s vaccination figures as the percentage of anti-vaxxers is minuscule.  According to a health department estimate, 14.3 lakh people, above 18 years of age, are eligible for vaccination in Dehradun.  Out of these, 6.9 lakh people — i.e 47.9% of the adult population — have received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Currently, Dehradun is the sixth-best performing district in Uttarakhand in terms of the percentage of population vaccinated fully. The top five districts in the state are — Bageshwar, where 62.5% of the adult population is fully vaccinated, followed by Chamoli (60.9%), Uttarkashi (55.8%), Rudraprayag (55.5%), and Champawat (50.2%). As of October 3, the state average is 41.4%. Meanwhile, district officials believe that they are on the right track to inoculate the entire population with the first dose by the end of this month.  “Our aim is to vaccinate 100% of the adult population with the first dose by the end of this month. Accordingly, dose 2 vaccinations, which require a gap of 12-16 weeks, will also be done,” said Abhishek Tripathi, chief operating officer, Covid-19 control room. As for vaccine hesitancy, the district officials say that they have run extensive awareness drives in all localities of the city to dispel all rumours with regards to vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vax-hesitancy-holds-back-doon-inoculation-drive/articleshow/86919915.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The court was hearing the public interest litigation filed by K R Rajendran who sought for a direction to forbear the authorities from constructing a unit for dumping biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste for establishing a bio-gas plant at Melapanaiyur village at Thirumayam taluk in the district. The petitioner submitted that during the rainy season, rainwater is collected from the feeding channels and drained into a waterbody spread across 4.05 acres. If the plant was established in the waterbody, it would result in blocking the water course leading to an oorani. However, the government pleader submitted that the land where the plant is to be established has been classified as vacant land and the project is under the central government scheme. He further submitted that establishing the plant on the vacant land belonging to the government would not cause any harm to the villagers. He also submitted that it will not disturb the environment of the village. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that since the land has been classified as a vacant land, it cannot be construed as a waterbody. The contention of the petitioner cannot be accepted in view of the records produced by the government pleader. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-against-establishing-bio-gas-plant/articleshow/86921737.cms||---
---||Jaipur||REET cheating case: Main accused Batti Lal Meena nabbed||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan police on Sunday nabbed Batti Lal Meena, the alleged kingpin in the REET cheating racket, from Uttarakhand. A senior official said that Meena was caught along with another person from Kedarnath. A special team was constituted soon after the Sawai Madhopur police and other investigation agencies had unearthed the scandal after the leaked REET question paper allegedly reached the accused before the exam on September 26. Police subsequently arrested 13 persons from different cities, including some police constables, for their alleged involvement in the case. Rajasthan police officials later said Batti Lal Meena was the main accused in the case. Efforts were made to track him down in different cities but he remained elusive. Meena may help investigators connect the dots about the alleged breach that took place despite foolproof security arrangements which included round-the-clock checking at important places. DGP ML Lather said the investigation into the case is underway. Meanwhile, sources said that Meena’s arrest was crucial because only he can reveal how he allegedly got the REET question paper before the exam. “We had arrested several persons who were beneficiaries of the cheating. Meena was absconding and his arrest was important to understand the nexus, if any, which facilitated the cheating,” said an official. With Meena caught, police hope to find other suspects who may have either actively aided him or facilitated him in one way or the other. “If any 'mole' had passed the paper to him before the exam, then only Meena can spill the beans,” said the official. The investigation into the case is led by the special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan police. Meanwhile, BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena said on Sunday that while the SOG has nabbed the prime accused, the agency is unlikely to lay hands on the real culprits behind the paper leak. “The SOG has been able to catch Batti Lal Meena, but powerful people involved in this (case) will not be caught as the state government will interfere. Hence, I demand a CBI investigation into this case to catch the real culprits who have cheated the unemployed youth of the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-cheating-case-main-accused-batti-lal-nabbed/articleshow/86923757.cms||---

Last month itself, Vasco reported 40 dengue cases. Apart from these 40, neighbouring Cortalim reported nine dengue cases, and the two locations comprised the entirety of South Goa’s dengue caseload that month. “While Cortalim has seen a dip since, Vasco continues to report high (numbers) because of unhealthy water storage practices in the slums,” said Dr Kalpana Mahatme, state in-charge of the national vector-borne disease control programme. “We had a meeting in Vasco. The chief officer of the municipality has agreed to give us six municipality employees who will help us in a source reduction drive,” Mahatme said. A timetable has also been prepared and teams, including rapid response units, have been constituted to focus on problem areas in Vasco. Mahatme said that just focusing on a case-to-case basis doesn’t help, but it’s important to destroy the source of infection in the area. While September saw 60 cases of dengue reported from various parts of North Goa, she said as many as 19 were reported from Panaji. The remaining cases were reported in Mapusa, Candolim, and Porvorim’s Malim jetty area. “Dengue infections were detected among migrant laborers working on fishing trawlers, soon after their arrival to Goa. No sooner did they arrive, they were tested for dengue and found positive,” she said. Prior to the cases found at Malim jetty, she said, the Porvorim center reported hardly any dengue infections. But suddenly last month, it reported seven cases, she said. Mahatme said although the total number of cases reported in September were more than those reported during the corresponding period in 2020, parallels can’t be drawn, as during that period (last September), the first wave of the pandemic was underway.

---||Lucknow||Those in legal battle with hospitals either give up or fight red-rapism||Lucknow: Faridinagar resident Ila Singh has lost all hope of justice for her mother who died of Covid-19 in April this year. Ila had complained to the chief medical officer (CMO) and the district administration about medical negligence and overcharging by an Aliganj hospital. She was charged Rs 1.2 lakh for about 12 hours of hospital stay, following which Ila’s mother succumbed to the disease. However, nothing came out of the whole process even after officials visited the hospital. Ila has stopped pursuing the case further due to red-tapism in the process. Hers is not the only case. Even after five months of having a Covid complaints committee, no substantial action has been taken against erring private hospitals accused and found guilty of fleecing patients during the second Covid wave. There are at least eight cases where hospitals have been found guilty and action is awaited. Against eight other hospitals, FIRs have been lodged. The license of only one erring hospital has been cancelled. Families like Ila’s either continue to wait or have given up after all. “After my mother died because of the hospital’s negligence, I complained. An SDM visited the hospital but the facility boasted to me that no matter who visits, they will not provide us with any original document required for medical reimbursements,” said Ila. “Only an incomplete duplicate bill was handed over. My brother has cerebral palsy and heightened anxiety. I have to manage work and home during which getting after these clerks and officials is not possible. I have given up,” she added. According to officials, investigation has been completed in eight other cases but no action, such as cancellation of licence or hospital seized, taken. “Most hospitals against which FIR was lodged for overcharging have moved court. Their licence will not be renewed at the CMO office,” informed CMO Dr Manoj Agarwal. On the time taken, an official said, “The committee report is sent to the nodal officer in charge of the hospital for legal proceedings. Sometimes, it happens in a day or two. After seven days, a reminder is sent.” In the case of Manoj Mishra, who lost his wife to Covid in May, the complainant sent letters not just to the chief development officer in charge of the Integrated Covid Command Centre but also to the CMO, chief minister and legislative assembly speaker. Despite this, Mishra is awaiting action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/those-in-legal-battle-with-hospitals-either-give-up-or-fight-red-rapism/articleshow/86923755.cms||---

As people are not allowed to gather in huge numbers, playful activities like dandiya and garba have been cancelled in most places. Also, only limited number of people will be allowed to enter puja pandals. Durga Bari, the oldest Durga Puja in the city, has decided to allow only 5 to 10 people for darshan at a time. Similarly, Durga Puja organisers at World Trade Park in Malviya Nagar have sent invitations to the people who will be allowed to enter the pandal and witness the pujas on all five days. The organisers have notified that only five people will be allowed to visit for darshan to avoid any social gathering. Many dandiya organisers, who had started sending invitations, have changed their plans. "Now, we will organise garba and dandiya with only 50 committee members. No one else will be allowed. We have to follow guidelines by the government," said Ravindra Kumar, a dandiya organiser. Garba organiser Rohit Sharma will now be organising the event only for his club members. Similarly, Sharwan Singh, who used to organise 300-member dandiya and garba every year, will celebrate the festival with only 50 people in his colony at Vishwakarma Industrial Area. "The police officials and district administration are not giving permission. Hence, we decided to celebrate just in our colony," said Singh. Some dress rental shop owners have said due to the restrictions, orders were getting cancelled. A dress rental shop owner in Mansarover said the orders were anyway limited, but with stricter guidelines, many people were cancelling their rental orders. Meanwhile, many organisers criticised the government’s rules saying no restrictions were imposed during elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-curbs-dampen-durga-puja-celebrations/articleshow/86923783.cms||---

The two nations fought for a month before China unilaterally declared a ceasefire. The 1962 war left a deep impact on India and its natives. Writer and professor Neelam Saran Gour, too, was influenced by the war and its aftermath, that prompted her to write a book on it. The war and its event came up for discussion at the weekend session of the Military Literature Festival. Gaur, along with festival organiser Maj Gen HK Singh and linguist-author Avinash Biniwale, threw light on the Indo-China war, its repercussions on the public. “I was 7-year-old in 1962 when the war broke out. Many things that occur in my book ‘Speaking of ’62’ are refashioned memories of my childhood,”recalled Gour. “I remember how the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru asked people to donate money, jewellery, woollens in order to support the nation since at the time of war we were unprepared and unfunded when the Chinese dominated us from all sides. Even I had collected Rs 56 and donated it,” she added. Maj Gen HK Singh discussed the event with linguist and researcher Avinash Biniwale and his book ‘Bomdila’, also on 1962 war. The session was live-streamed on Zoom and YouTube.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1962-war-left-a-deep-impact-on-indian-public/articleshow/86923759.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Birders, ornithologists, nature lovers, including Dr Badrinarayan, Arittapatty Ravichandran, Ahil from Western Ghats Wildlife Conservation Trust, M Rajesh, deputy convenor, Green Club, The American College, teachers, professors from Yadava College, students, and public participated in a programme held in connection with the World Migratory Bird Day (WMBD) in the city on Saturday. They visited the Avaniapuram and Karisalkulam and spotted 48 species of birds including sparrows, red vented bulbul, and koel. Other birds spotted by them were grey heron, blue tailed bee eater, Indian cormorant, purple heron, great egret, cattle egret, common myna, white throated kingfisher, palm swift, knob billed duck, brown shrike, barn swallow, glossy ibis (arival mookan in Tamil and Purple moorhen (Neela Thalai Kozhi in Tamil) among others. Avaniapuram tank due to its proximity to the city and its traffic movement seemed to have disturbed the bird life, as it has a lesser number of birds than Karisalkulam tank. “But, the sewage and garbage surrounding this tank made it difficult for people to access it, and the corporation should take action to prevent the houses in Dinamani Nagar from discharging their sewage into the tank,” said the bird watchers. They said that the civic body could also consider constructing a fence around the tank to prevent plastic waste from entering the tank. It could affect the migrating birds and their fledglings in many ways. “When the young birds start learning to fly, the plastic could prove dangerous to them if they get caught or tangled in it,” said Rajesh.  Some men were also seen hunting water hens in the tank, the forest department should keep an eye on these tanks, when the migratory birds are nesting during the season, said Kalaiselvi, a student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/clean-up-trash-around-tanks-bring-back-birds-watchers-nature-lovers/articleshow/86921768.cms||---

Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi inaugurated the excavation. Adhichanallur is the site where archaeological excavations first began in India, 146 years ago. After that, the ASI took up excavations there in 2004, and subsequently the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department conducted excavations last year and this year. In the budget last year, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the government planned to develop five archaeological sites, as ‘iconic sites’ with a budget allocation of Rs 3,500 crore. T Arun Raj, superintending archaeologist, ASI Trichy circle, who will head this excavation, had sent a proposal for excavation and development of the site and the same had been approved. Kanimozhi told reporters that a world class iconic open site museum would be established at the site. She said that the site museum will have toughened glass covering which would enable visitors to walk over them and see the artefacts as they were unearthed at various levels of soil. Asked whether the budget allocation of Rs 17 crore would suffice for the project, she said that they hoped that the Union government would allocate more funds as the excavation and the work on the museum progressed. This ancient site is considered to be the burial site of an iron age civilization that flourished on the banks of Thamirabarini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/asi-begins-excavation-at-adhichanallur/articleshow/86921739.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: 18 SP workers face attempt to murder charge after protest, Meerut police claim attack by them||MEERUT: Police in Meerut district have booked 18 Samajwadi Party (SP) workers, most of them students, under attempt to murder charge and sent 16 of them to jail, alleging that they attacked and injured a policeman when stopped from burning the effigy of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Apart from the stringent section of 307 (attempt to murder), the protesters were also booked under 15 more IPC sections including rioting and unlawful assembly despite prohibitory orders. The party’s district president Rajpal Singh has now written to the district magistrate, saying that those arrested were “innocent youths who were simply exercising their right to protest.” But, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut, Prabhakar Chaudhary, claimed that the SP workers had thrown petrol on policemen. “A policeman received burn injuries as the petrol caught fire,” the SSP said. The FIR was filed on October 4th, the day when the SP had organized a protest against Lakhimpur Kheri violence. And the 16 SP workers, mostly from its youth wing, were sent to jail the next day. The SSP told TOI that around 200 SP workers were present at the spot -- near the commissioner officer-- during the protest. “But only 18 have been booked as they hurt a policeman on duty. Their own party workers were also injured." “One of our constables received burn injuries and his dress was burnt. They started fighting with policemen who were just trying to make them understand that such protests were not allowed as Section 144 of CRPC was in force,” said the SSP. But, reacting to the police’s claim, SP’s Rajpal Singh asked, “Since when protest has become an offence that is charged with attempt to murder. Also, where is the policeman who is said to have been hurt? You think someone with burn injuries can get well in five days? With no mark?” Singh alleged that the case against the SP workers was filed in an “act of revenge” and the government is using police and bureaucracy to threaten the other political parties. “There was no petrol at the spot at all,” he said, adding that the youth wing members who were booked under such serious sections have a career ahead and many of them hail from poor families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/18-sp-workers-face-attempt-to-murder-charge-after-protest-police-claim-attack-by-them/articleshow/86919947.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Aurangabad||‘Pay attention to rain-hit M’wada farmers first’||Aurangabad: Ahead of the state-wide bandh called by Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on Monday to protest against the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, farmers’ groups from Marathwada have demanded relief measures for the rain-hit farmers in the region first. Stating that even the Panchanama process is yet to be over in the rain-battered areas, farmers’ groups have alleged that Marathwada has been neglected as compared to western Maharashtra, which had witnessed natural calamity in the recent past and is said to have received profuse help from the government. Jayaji Suryawanshi of ‘Annadata’, a farmers’ group, said scores of farmers in Marathwada were left in the lurch by the state government during the current pandemic. “The violence in Lakhimpur Kheri is condemnable, but we question the inaction and silence of the state government towards the plight of farmers. Weeks after the natural calamity struck them, farmers from Marathwada are still awaiting official help,” he said. Annadata has demanded blanket help to all affected farmers at the earliest to prepare for the upcoming rabi season. Rajan Kshirsagar of Kisan Sabha said the call for bandh against Lakhimpur Kheri does not necessarily highlight that it is a pro-farmer government. “While farmers from western Maharashtra get instant and profuse help when the tragedy strikes, Marathwada farmers are made to wait endlessly. We condemn such a biased attitude,” he said. State deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who held a review meeting on Saturday, said crops on over 34 lakh hectare area in Marathwada have been damaged due to heavy rains. While pegging total damage to around Rs 4,000 crore, he said the government would stand firmly behind affected farmers and others. In the Lakhimpur incident, eight people were killed during a farmers’ protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pay-attention-to-rain-hit-mwada-farmers-first/articleshow/86917927.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The fisher-activist who died at his house in Pamban earlier in the day, strived to protect the interests of fishermen and formed Thangachimadam Fishermen’s Association, which is said to be the forerunner to all fishing associations in the region. He documented the attack on fishermen by Sri Lankan navy, as well as other attacks. He had fought to get their wages increased. He was recognised by many organisations for his service to the fishing community. MDMK leader Vaiko said he has lost a dear friend. “He took up the fight against the attack on Rameswaram fishermen by Sri Lankan navy right from the early 1980s. He breathed and lived for the welfare of the fishing community. He organized legal assistance for fishermen when they were produced in Sri Lankan courts. When five Rameswaram fishermen were sentenced to death by a Sri Lankan court, he opposed it vehemently,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/activist-leader-arulanandhams-death-mourned/articleshow/86921780.cms||---

The venue is likely to be Shanmukhananda Hall at Sion with 50% of its capacity. The party was keen on a physical rally at Shivaji Park, but chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took a call to avoid a mega gathering of Sainiks, keeping in mind Covid-19 protocol.

---||Madurai||Fibre from black yeast can cut adverse effects of Covid-19, finds pilot study||Madurai: A pilot clinical study conducted by a panel of Indo-Japanese team of medical experts through a private hospital in Madurai has revealed that Beta-glucans, a food supplement derived from a black yeast, can reduce the adverse effects caused by SARS CoV-2 virus. Beta-glucan is a soluble fibre found naturally in cereal grains, yeast and certain mushrooms. Dr K Raghavan, neurologist at Kenmax Neurology Institute and a senior member of the team, said that SARS-CoV-2 virus generally causes inflammation and triggers cytokine storm. “As the body fights the virus, often the damage caused to tissues, especially lungs, is due to the inflammatory response. During cytokine storm, IL-6, a cytokine, is released. This particular yeast lowers the IL-6 release,” he added. He said they had collaborated with Japanese medical experts to study autism in children. “At that time, we came to know of Beta-glucan food supplement derived from Aureobasidium pullulans, which is a registered food supplement in Japan. Traditionally, Japanese even keep this yeast in their homes. The chemicals found in this yeast were found to have anti-inflammatory properties,” he explained. The clinical study, which has been authorised by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and has been acknowledged by Clinical Trials Registry – India, was funded by the Prefectural Government of Yamanashi and Government of Japan. A total of 24 adult patients in the age group of 18-65 years were identified and split into three groups. During the course of study, all three groups received standard Covid-19 treatment according to ICMR protocol, while two groups were provided with the Beta-glucan food supplement, in two different measures. At the end of the study, it was found that the groups that received the supplement fared better than those who didn’t receive it. The patients also recovered faster and showed reduced symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue which are common in Covid-19 patients. Dr Raghavan said that based on the findings and publication, Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University is now collaborating to give this supplement to 100 patients. “The Aureobasidium pullulans food supplement will gather wider acceptance and will soon be available for public consumption after this,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fibre-from-black-yeast-can-cut-adverse-effects-of-covid-19-finds-pilot-study/articleshow/86921810.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Pandinattu Panpattu Maiyam coordinator D Muneeswaran said that K Sivan, of Thennamanallur near Kallikudi, had informed them of a hero stone in his village. A team from the organisation including Manikandan, Anandhakumar, Vaikiraja and others went to the village and found the hero stone, dating back to 15th century AD, half buried in the ground. Muneeswaran said that hero stones played an important role in Tamil culture right from the Sangam era. These are stones erected in memory of people who die heroically in war. The stone they found in Thennamanallur was four feet in height, two feet in width and 12 inches in thickness. It is a relief sculpture made of granite stone and the man is seen holding a bow in his left hand and the right hand is resting on a sword on his hip. His hair bun is seen slightly tilted to the left, and he is seen wearing jewellery on his neck and ears. A broad chain known as ‘Sannaveeram’ said to be adorned on men who go to war is also seen on his chest. On his back there is a quiver with eleven arrows. “The sculpture depicts the man making brave strides towards a war front. This may be the hero stone for a man who was skilled in the use of bow and arrows and died in war. People in this village worship him as ‘Vettaikaran’ or hunter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/600-year-old-hero-stone-of-hunter-found-near-kallikudi/articleshow/86921798.cms||---

Attacking the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government over Lakhimpur Kheri violence that left eight dead, Yadav said, “These people have rammed farmers under the wheels. They have not just rammed farmers but have also rammed the law in this case.” In Saharanpur to mark the 100th birth anniversary of former UP minister Yashpal Chaudhary, Yadav was addressing his first political rally in western UP ahead of the assembly elections scheduled early next year. “Farmers are our ‘annadaata’ (food givers). They have to face insults today. Farmers are being called 'mawali',” he said and alleged that if BJP comes back to power, they will call farmers ``terrorists”. He congratulated the farmers for not stepping back from their agitation against the three draconian farm laws despite insults heaped on them by BJP. The former CM of Uttar Pradesh said , “If we would have won, the farm laws and Citizenship (Amendment) Act would have never been on the floor of the House (Parliament). People must get this government to realize that dictatorship will not work in a democracy,” Criticizing the government for “privatization of public assets”, including railways and airlines, Yadav warned if BJP comes to power again, the day is not far away when the government would be run via outsourcing. Blaming the ruling party for skyrocketing prices of essential commodities -- from mustard oil to gas and even power – the SP leader said these were now beyond the buying capacity of the common man and urged people not to vote for BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/those-who-can-crush-farmers-can-crush-constitution-says-akhilesh/articleshow/86919954.cms||Ishita Mishra

Based on her parents’ complaint, five persons including a school teacher were booked for allegedly raping and molesting the minor. In fact, according to Veraval police, the school teacher had been molesting and demanding sexual favour from the girl for the last one and a half years. All these got exposed after the survivor went missing from home on October 7 morning and returned home only the next day. When questioned, the girl revealed to her parents that Promis Chudasama, a friend of her brother, had taken her to his farm where he sexually assaulted her. The five persons booked for complaint of rape and molestation included Amit Goswami, a resident of Keshod, Praveen Sevara, a school teacher from Gadi village and a resident of Vishanvel village, Mustaq Lakha, a resident of Gadu village, and, Promis Chudasama, a resident of Kanek village. All the accused have been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 376 (rape), 354 (using criminal force on any woman, intending to outrage her modesty) and sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The police said that that Praveen Suvera, a teacher in J N Chhaliya school in Gadu village, had proposed love to the minor one and a half years ago she was studying in class VIII. Since then, accused would molest the minor even in the classroom and kept demanding sexual favours from her. “Suvera would talk about sex with the minor girl as well,” cops said. During this time, the survivor also came in contact with Amit Goswami from Keshod, when they both had gone to work as labourers, around 18 months ago. The accused allegedly took her to different villages and hotels where he raped her four times, said cops. At that time, Mustaq Lakha, a resident of Gadu village and friend of Goswami came to know about the her relationships with Amit and taking advantage of it, he too sexually assaulted her twice in Gadu village, four months ago. In October, Promis Chudasama, who too came to know about her episodes with the other men, took her to Somnath where he raped her, said the police.

The court held that the material on record brings out prima facie an offence under Section 304 (Part II) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused. “In the case at hand, the statements of the witnesses, prima facie bring out that the accused was a regular driver at the KTC bus stand, which was the place of accident, and knowingly took the bus in the wrong direction against the flow of the traffic, in high speed, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the passengers who were getting down from another bus, thereby causing injuries to some and death to two of the passengers,” additional sessions judge Edgar P Fernandes said. Counsel Godinho representing the accused contested the framing of charge under Section 304 of IPC stating that there was no material to suggest that the accused had an intention to kill. The public prosecutor however submitted that statements of witnesses bring out that the accused in spite of having knowledge of road directions, drove the bus in a wrong direction, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed victims, causing serious injuries to some and death of the two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bus-driver-faces-murder-charge-for-rash-driving/articleshow/86921906.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||For Brig Gill, splinter through turban a reminder of war||Ludhiana: He had just a year of army service under his belt when the 1971 Indo-Pak war broke out. For Brig S S Gill (retired), the closest shave he had during the conflict was when a splinter narrowly missed him and went through his turban during Pakistani shelling on the eastern front. Brig Gill, who now lives in Ludhiana’s South City, says he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Indian Army on December 20, 1970, after he had finished his training at the National Defence Academy and Indian Military Academy. “I was posted with the artillery and deputed at Haldwani in Uttarakhand (then Uttar Pradesh). In August 1971, we were moved to Binaguri, which is on the border of West Bengal and Bangladesh. I was posted as a gun position officer. For some months, there were skirmishes between us and the Pakistani Army in the Rangpur-Dinajpur sector in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh), but later a full-scale war began,” says Brig Gill, who is now 73 years old. The abbreviation of Brig Gill’s name expands to Sukhkarn Singh. “I still remember the time when my gun position was shelled by Pakistani artillery. One of the splinters went through my turban that night. We retaliated but lost three men and a few colleagues were also injured. However, we continued to fight and later entered the Rangpur-Dinajpur axis and captured Thakargaon, Burgmari. Ultimately, the Pakistani Army surrendered,” he adds. Brig Gill feels lucky to have survived the splinter. He says when he returned home in February 1972, he took the turban along and gave it to his mother, late Satwant Kaur. Her expression, he says, was: “Bacha bach gaya hai (my son has been saved).” She preserved the turban. Conflict taught him Brig Gill calls the conflict a great experience for him as a young officer as it helped him in later years of service. He was posted as a brigade commander at Baramulla and served there for two years. “Besides militancy, there would be shelling from the Pakistani side. However, I succeeded during my posting there,” says Brig Gill. Son also in the same regiment While one of Brig Gill’s sons owns a restaurant business, the other is a lieutenant colonel in the Indian Army. Lt Col Gurkaran Singh Gill is also with his father’s regiment. Brig Gill says his wife, Kim Gill, was the biggest pillar of support for him when he was serving in the army. She, however, succumbed to cancer in 2018. War stories with children Brig Gill says he would share his experiences with his children when they were growing up. Though he fails to recollect the number of his course mates who died in the war, Brig Gill says they must be 20-25. “I feel proud that we won that war,” he says. Brig Gill also got a medal for participating in the war.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/for-brig-gill-splinter-through-turban-a-reminder-of-war/articleshow/86921850.cms||Shariq Majeed

Among such errant drivers, a total of 51 attended a speed of 90 km/hour and above, risking lives of the passengers. The workers union, meanwhile, has demanded revision of upper speed limit of buses to achieve larger good. The MSRTC has prepared a division-wise list of such drivers by using tools such as Vehicle Tracking System and Passenger Information System available with the state transportation. The exercise was part of the official analysis carried out by the MSRTC to look into the reasons of road accidents involving its buses. MSRTC divisional traffic officer Amol Ahire on Sunday said drivers found over-speeding get reprimanded and repeated offenders are subjected to further disciplinary action. “The respective depot authorities have been asked to establish contact with errant drivers. Following the speed-limit is important for safety of the passengers as well as the drivers and conductors,” he said. While most of the MSRTC buses are locked for a speed above 75 km per hour, state transport utility officials, preferring anonymity, said few drivers tend to manipulate the mechanical system concerned. State transport minister Anil Parab could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-700-msrtc-bus-drivers-found-over-speeding-in-maha/articleshow/86918015.cms||Prasad Joshi

Reviewing work by field units, the DGP specifically asked crime branch to increase detection and challaning rate of cases related to crime against properties. Agrawal also asked ADGP (crime) O P Singh to fix targets for field units and increase the detection of property-related crime. “As of now, we have analysed the rate of reporting and detection of crime against properites by various cells across the state. After analysis, we shall finalise the target for the last quarter of the calendar year ending December 31. We are almost in the final stage now,” said O P Singh. Haryana Police registers and investigates over a lakh cases under various sections of IPC and local and special laws every year. Of these, 19% cases of IPC offences are cancelled on accusations of being found to be false, added Singh while elaborating on other cases. Also, 47% cases are related to thefts and other issues, and these are worked out and put to court for trial. Data will be shared with field units to help them draw a strategy to check habitual offenders through man-to-man marking,” said a state crime branch spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/set-detection-targets-for-crime-branch/articleshow/86921913.cms||---

It was a usual Saturday morning for the family. Muniya’s husband, Dilshaad, who works with a gas agency, had left for work. Their daughter Alisha (13) and son Aahat (10) had left for school soon after. Muniya was at home with their youngest kid — three-year-old son Arhaam. Police said that when Alisha and Aahat returned home around 1.30pm, they found their mother dead on the sofa and Arhaam crying on the floor. Dilshaad was supplying gas cylinders in Loni when he received a call from a neighbour. “It took me 20 minutes to reach home. I saw my wife’s body on the sofa and the three children crying nearby,” he said. The accused, according to Dilshaad, said the almirah on the first-floor room was broken and the cash and jewellery were missing. “I had taken some loan from a friend to give money to a relative. That was gone,” he said. A senior police officer said some neighbours had told the cops that they heard loud music playing inside the house and thought Muniya must have switched on the system. The music stopped after 20 minutes, the police said. SP (rural) Iraj Raja said that an FIR had been registered at Loni police station against unknown persons under sections 302 (murder) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the IPC. “We have formed three teams to nab the culprits. One team has been checking CCTV footage of nearby areas. So far, we have examined clips from over 30 cameras, but have not got any leads. The forensic team is matching some fingerprints found in the scene of crime,” he added. The body has been sent for autopsy and the reports have confirmed death by smothering. “Initial investigation has revealed that the accused used a pillow to kill the woman and escaped with cash and jewellery. Only the kid was at home with her mother,” Raja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/back-from-school-kids-find-mother-murdered/articleshow/86923866.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Avoid leopard attacks at Aarey, posters show how||MUMBAI: Awareness posters on how to avoid leopards and prevent human-animal conflicts have been put up inside Aarey Colony, following six leopard attacks recently. Shiv Sena party member and social activist, Intekhab Farooqui, told TOI: “I have started displaying educational and awareness posters at various places at Aarey Colony so that locals can avoid leopard attacks. It has become a big concern inside this green zone as leopards are now more frequently seen coming out of the adjoining Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The instructions in these posters are in Marathi and English, so that they are easy to understand.”' Farooqui added: “The latest attack two days ago was on a 14-year-old. Parents must ensure that children stay at home after 7pm as leopards are known to venture out in the evening. Another instruction in the posters is that one must not panic on coming face-to-face with a leopard; but one must stand up straight and clap with both hands or hit a stick on the ground in order to appear bigger and stronger than the predator.” Honorary wildlife warden Pawan Sharma of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare said: “The forest department’s vans are also patrolling various areas of Aarey Colony, and announcing instructions on loudspeakers on what to do in order to prevent leopard attacks. Six trap cages have also been set where cubs and sub-adults were earlier seen by people. We’ve told locals to move in groups, and carry a good torchlight.” Activist Amrita Bhattacharjee of Save Aarey Group said increasing encroachments and illegal construction at Aarey, besides cutting of trees to build more hutmentshad led to a sharp rise of human numbers in the green zone, thereby leading to more leopard encounters and attacks. “People must not spread rumours or share fake viral videos that can cause panic,” said the activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-avoid-leopard-attacks-at-aarey-posters-show-how/articleshow/86924408.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Noida||Can part of Karauli Bangar village be kept out of airport project, Noida asks NIAL||Greater Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has written to the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), the special purpose vehicle of the state government, to see if a part of the village of Karuali Bangar can be left out of the second phase of land acquisition. Just 500-600 metres off the Yamuna Expressway, Nagla Hukum Singh settlement of Karauli Bangar is home to around 220 families. The villagers are ready to part with the agricultural land, but do not want to give up the residential plots on which their ancestral properties are built.During the social impact assessment itself, the villagers had threatened to boycott land acquisition proceedings. “We are not going to give away our ancestral property. The rehabilitation plan of the administration is not acceptable to us. Now that we have opportunities in our area because of the project, the administration wants us to leave our houses. Considering the projects coming up in the Yamuna Expressway region, our village will see a lot of development. We have seen what the families who have been relocated to Jewar Bangar have got,” said villager Dharmendra Siwach.Additional district magistrate (land acquisition) Balram Singh said the villagers’ demands had been forwarded to NIAL. “It is adjacent to the boundary wall of the second stage of the airport. NIAL can take a look at the land requirement and decide if the old settlement could be left like that by realigning the boundary and adding other land chunks,” said Singh, adding that the acquisition in other areas would go on as usual.Nagla Hukum Singh is 500-600 m from the e-way. Sector 29, which is near the village, is where handicraft park, apparel park and MSME park are being planned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/can-part-of-karauli-bangar-village-be-kept-out-of-airport-project-noida-asks-nial/articleshow/86923900.cms||Shalabh

While the normal value is in the range of 82-83mm, this year the actual value is 178mm. As of now, there is a circulation over the east central Arabian Sea. Simultaneously there is a circulation over the Andaman Sea, which is intensifying into a low pressure area. Further intensification is likely which may move towards the Andhra Pradesh coast over the week. A weather system called the trough is a connection of these two circulations – over the Arabian Sea and the Andaman Sea. The trough is passing over South Maharashtra, parts of coastal Andhra Pradesh, South Telangana, and North interior Karnataka. “Owing to these systems, there is a possibility of heavy rainfall exceeding 6.4cm over Goa in the coming days, till October 12. The rainfall will be accompanied with thunder and lightning and there is possibility of thunderstorm accompanied with lightning at isolated places over Goa till October 12,” India meteorological department (IMD) said. There is also the possibility of a low pressure area forming over the Bay of Bengal and its westward movement. Accordingly, there could be changes in the weather even after October 12, the IMD has warned. The Southwest monsoon withdrawal line is currently passing Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. “Monsoon withdrawal is very likely to take place in some more parts of Gujarat, most parts of Madhya Pradesh, some parts of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal in the coming two days,” IMD forecast read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heavy-rain-with-thunder-lightning-likely-till-tuesday/articleshow/86922011.cms||---

Organisers of many pujas said that last year’s Covid norms will stay this year. Social distancing will be maintained at pandals, and other norms like wearing face masks and sanitising will be done. Ramesh Modak, secretary of Dehradun Durgabari, told TOI, “We are observing durga puja with strict Covid guidelines this year too. However, compared to last year, some relaxations have been granted. The entry gates of Durgabari premises will be open during puja and Sandhya aarti but gathering will not be allowed. Anjali will be allowed, but it will be offered without flowers and in batches.” Modak added that they will upload pre-recorded cultural programmes to their Facebook page to avoid public gathering at a live event. Also, bhog prasad offered to the goddess will be packed and delivered to homes. Himanshu Chakraborty, secretary of the Uttarayani Kali Bari Committee, said, “Only members of the committee will be allowed to perform at or attend the cultural programmes in small groups. For sindur khela (a ritual where women smear each other with vermillion on the last day of Durga Puja), only those who are fully vaccinated will be allowed to participate.” Meanwhile, idol makers who come all the way from West Bengal said business has been hit this year too. Pradyut Pal, an idol maker, said, “I am part of a group of artisans from West Bengal and we have been facing a devastating financial crunch since last year. We did get some orders this year, but it is half of what we would usually get in a good year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/durga-puja-in-doon-to-be-muted-affair-this-year-too/articleshow/86920056.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee
---||Trichy||4 yrs on, only 15 of 60 smart city projects over||Trichy: Four years after being selected under the smart cities mission, Trichy corporation has been lacking the pace to complete the projects approved and funded under the programme. With only 15 proposals completed and launched for public use, the urban local body has 45 more to complete of which work is yet to commence on at least three infrastructure projects. Many of the proposals have failed to get commissioned before the assured deadline. Trichy city was selected for the programme in June 2017 based on the Smart City Proposal (SCP) submitted to the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA). While other cities that were selected along with the civic body have achieved desirable progress in executing the work, several proposals including Uyyakondan riverfront development, Chathiram bus stand, multi-level car parking and heritage tourism development remain incomplete for a few years now. Two years after Thillai Nayagam ghats on Odathurai road were demolished by the civic body for a smart makeover, the proposal that was supposed to be completed in six months remains incomplete. The same is the case of Purathana park redevelopment on Butterworth road. Two years on, not even half the civil work in the park is completed. While only 15 of the total 60 proposals have been completed, the experts questioned the civic body over the lack of focus on sports and transport sectors. “Transportation and road development sector was completely ignored. Fast-growing vehicular traffic needed a comprehensive management plan, but smart cities fund was heavily spent on recreational proposals,” S Surya Narayanan, a transportation engineer, said. While Trichy corporation mainly blamed it on the delay in obtaining clearances from stakeholders and Covid-19 lockdowns, the slow pace of execution by the contractors tasked with completing the civil work is glossed over. Projects such as underground drainage and water supply that could have been taken up under other funds have consumed about Rs 110 crores of the smart cities fund which could have been used for other proposals. “Compared to cities selected simultaneously for the programme, Trichy is doing fairly good. In the next few months, we will expedite and complete the ongoing projects,” a senior official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/4-yrs-on-only-15-of-60-smart-city-projects-over/articleshow/86921935.cms||Deepak Karthik

However, physical darshan is limited so rituals will be streamed online. The universal attraction of ‘bhog prasad’ will be absent but a few entertainment shows have migrated online. Pandals in Chembur, Vashi and Bhayander have invited Bengali artisans to craft clay idols of Goddess Durga and her children, and enshrined them in picturesque sets resembling palaces or village homes. The Chembur Durga Puja Association has shifted its venue to Aangan Lawn opposite Deonar bus depot owing to the unavailability of its regular school ground. Ten trained artisans from Bengal are sculpting an ethnic, palatial zamindari replica on site. President Surojit Lodh said, “The ‘anjali’ ritual is very close to our hearts so we have arranged both online and offline offerings. Puja rituals will be broadcast live.” The organisers will ensure there is no overcrowding at the pandal, and will avoid distributing ‘bhog prasad’ to the public. “Bhog will be restricted to members only. And instead of serving it in the pandal, we have purchased new containers and hired a few auto rickshaws to despatch the meals to their homes on time,” said secretary Surajit Sengupta. The pandal of the 39-year-old Banga Sangha in Bhayander has prepared a celestial setting for its picturesque 4-ft idol of Goddess Durga.  “Moortikar Subhojit Das has sculpted the idol. The deity is cushioned upon wads of cotton wool that make it appear as if she is seated in the sky,” said vice president Rathin Dutta. Banga Sangha will allow physical darshan but will be ensure there’s enough distancing. It will avoid distributing bhog prasad. Masks and sanitiser are mandated. At Sector 6 in Vashi, the Navi Mumbai Bengali Association (NMBA) will celebrate its 42nd year of Sharodutsav. NMBA member Ashim Dey said, “Our theme depicts our rural celebration under the banyan tree. Our celebration remains in digital mode, and we will stream rituals to 130 countries worldwide through YouTube.”  NMBA will organise live performances by Tollywood and Hindi film singers from their own studios, and these will be beamed online for people to watch on their mobile phones or smart TV.

He said it would cost the Congress dearly to play with the sentiments of the people of Mandi. Thakur said this while addressing public meetings in favour of BJP candidate Khushal Thakur at Udaipur in Lahaul-Spiti district and Gadagushaini in Seraj. Taking a jibe at the Congress, he said after filing nomination in Mandi, Congress candidate Pratibha Singh said that she did not intend to contest elections. He added that Pratibha Singh told an open platform that she was not going to contest elections. “Then are they being forced to contest elections? he asked. The CM said a Congress leader, who had come to Mandi, abused him from the stage. He said that everyone has the right to seek votes, but votes cannot be sought by abusing. While campaigning for Brigadier Khushal Thakur at Gadagushaini, Jai Ram Thakur again attacked the Congress and said it would be costly for the Congress leaders to play with the sentiments of the people of Mandi. Referring to former chief minister late Virbhadra Singh, he said, “We had ideological differences, but never fought a personal battle. There was respect for each other.

Police officers said the woman has been booked for abetment of suicide. On August 18, Rahul Sharma (22), a resident of Agra, was found hanging himself from a ceiling fan at his rented accommodation in Greater Noida. He had allegedly used an electric cable. According to the police, Rahul’s friend, who has been booked, is an engineering student at a private college in Greater Noida. The FIR lodged in the case says that the woman had “lured” Rahul with a marriage proposal and made him buy several expensive items, including jewellery. But later, Rahul found out that she was already in two more relationships. After Rahul’s death, his mother lodged a police complaint alleging that the woman had asked the youth to marry her. She claimed that the student would often ask Rahul to buy her expensive gifts. “She had asked my son to buy some jewellery for her. When my son found out that she had been dating two other people, he tried talking to her. But she told my son that they bought her more expensive gifts than what Rahul got her. He got very upset. He had spoken to me about this as well. Later, he spoke to his brother and uncle. He had said he felt better after speaking about the incident,” the woman has said. Rahul’s mother alleged that on July 7, the woman had met Rahul. “That day, she took away my son’s new phone that he had bought online through a credit card. When he asked her to return it, the woman said she would. But after some time, she told my son that she had sold the phone,” the woman said. “She also encouraged my son to kill himself,” Rahul’s mother has told the police. Rameshwar Kumar, SHO, Beta 2 police station, said that an FIR has been registered against the woman under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 379 (theft) of the IPC. “An investigation is underway and soon, the student would be called in for questioning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/friend-booked-for-abetment-two-mths-after-youth-found-hanging/articleshow/86923879.cms||---

---||Goa||Players know what to do in defence, biggest challenge is attack: Thomas Dennerby||Panaji: The Indian women’s football team have had it easy so far on their exposure tour. India scored four against United Arab Emirates (UAE) and five against Bahrain. Even though, in-between these two victories, they lost by a solitary goal against Tunisia, Thomas Dennerby’s team were dominant all through. Now India are bracing for a different challenge as they play Chinese Taipei on Wednesday and then travel to Sweden for friendlies against Hammarby IF and Djurgardens, both top-tier clubs coached by Dennerby in the past. “I expect us to defend more than the first three games,” Dennerby told reporters during an online interaction on Monday. “For the first time on this exposure tour, our defence will be under pressure for some parts (during the game). I just hope the girls can show that they can remain compact against better teams.” Organising the defence has been the easier part for the Swedish coach who guided the women’s team to a third-place finish at the FIFA World Cup in 2011. The players, feels Dennerby, now understand what he wants them to do for the defensive part. The biggest challenge is in attack. “Earlier there were long balls for the strikers to run. Now we are trying to build from the back. When you change your style from playing direct to more passes through midfield, you have to work very hard in training. It takes a little bit longer (to learn) than defending, so we have to be patient,” he said. India will be underdogs at the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022. The hosts will have crowd cheering them from the stands, but those who qualify will arrive here with some quality. Dennerby knows that better than anyone else and is preparing them for the tougher challenges, particularly after previous losses appeared to have affected the players psychologically. It was evident against Tunisia; once the opponents took the lead, India lost their way. “The mental part is the hard one to work in the classrooms,” said Dennerby. “The girls need to understand that it’s very natural that you will sometimes miss a pass or miss a goal-scoring chance. You don’t have to think too much about the past, just work on that and look at the next situation. We are trying to boost them with a lot of self-confidence.” The coach has no complaints about the team’s approach to games and training. The attitude, he said, has been brilliant all through as they want to learn and are “serious in everything they do.” The team will face their biggest tests in Sweden next week when they are up against the might of teams from the country’s top-division. First up for India will be Hammarby IF who attracted a record crowd of 18,537 for the team’s Stockholm derby with AIK on Sunday. Then there’s Djurgardens, a team that Dennerby took to the UEFA Women's Cup final in 2005. “They are still a good team,” said Dennerby. “We will have two good games next week. A few players will be missing because the matches are played during the FIFA window and there are (World Cup) qualifiers.

---||Aurangabad||MVA & BJP engage in war of words on bandh||Aurangabad: While the MVA partners have appealed for a bandh on Monday to condemn the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP leadership had criticised the agitation. Maharashtra PWD minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan, justifying the bandh call, said the farming community has strong objections to the farm laws framed by the Centre. “Farmers’ protests have been going on for months. The Centre is reluctant to hear the farmers’ side and is not taking a public-centric stand. Instead, the Lakhimpur incident implies that the government is trying to suppress the farmers’ voices. Congress leaders such as Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were prevented from meeting the victims and their family members,” said Chavan, who is also the Nanded guardian minister. BJP leader and former water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar, however, said the MVA government should first address the rise in the number of farmer suicides in Maharashtra during its tenure before shedding crocodile tears over the UP violence. “The UP incident is condemnable and the law will take its own course. While the MVA government is showing sympathy for the farmers in UP, it should also break silence on the plight of farmers in Maharashtra,” he said. Lonikar added the state’s economy has already taken a hit due to the pandemic as all commercial establishments were closed, and the call for a bandh would further affect the businessmen and traders, besides the general public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mva-bjp-engage-in-war-of-words-on-bandh/articleshow/86918029.cms||---

Health minister Ma Subramanian, who inspected a camp in Dindigul district, stressed that vaccination is the best way to fight Covid-19. “Study has showed that more than 80% of Covid-19 deaths are those who are not vaccinated. We will continue to hold such mega Covid-19 vaccination drives to cover more population as much as possible,” he told reporters. The minister also highlighted that there was no oxygen shortage in Tamil Nadu and that 70 oxygen generator plants had been inaugurated recently in government hospitals across the state. In Trichy, vaccination camps were held in 618 locations across the district, of which 200 were in the city.

Around 200 persons residing in apartments in the Ariyamanagalam zone were covered by the mobile units. At the regular vaccination camps, pace picked up after the health officials mobilised local influencers and approached unvaccinated people. “Targeted vaccination will only help from now on. Patronage for mass vaccination drive has been on the decline in the last two weeks,” a health officer in Trichy city said. In Madurai, out of 87,711 who were vaccinated, 54,862 were from rural camps while 31,245 were from corporation camps. 1,604 were vaccinated at government hospitals, including Government Rajaji Hospital. 1,400 camps were organized across the district.

---||Delhi||Centre closing eye to looming power crisis, just like oxygen shortage: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Sunday alleged that the central government was “turning a blind eye” towards the coal and energy crisis in the same way it “ran away” from its responsibilities when the country was facing an oxygen crisis during the second Covid wave. “While other state governments are planning long power cuts, the power department of Delhi government is also keeping a close watch on the situation. If the coal stock required to generate power at plants allocated to the capital is available for less than 24 hours, outages will be planned,” said Sisodia. Power plants within the city are largely gas-based and currently there is no challenge to gas availability. Talking to reporters, Sisodia said, “While the country is facing a coal and energy crisis, the central government, instead of paying attention to the issue, is running away from its responsibility and shamelessly branding the genuine appeals by state governments as rumours. Union energy minister RK Singh is saying that there is no coal crisis. It is extremely unfortunate that he has maintained such an irresponsible attitude.” On Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that Delhi could face a power crisis and sought PM Narendra Modi’s intervention in making coal and gas available to the generation plants. Sisodia said Singh had, instead, suggested that the Delhi CM should not have written to the Prime Minister. “The governments of Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, among others, have warned the Centre about an incoming crisis, many power plants have been closed and the states are planning power cuts,” he added. “In spite of this, the central government is turning a blind eye to the issue. It is neither concerned nor does it want to solve the crisis. The Centre chooses to keep its eyes shut during every crisis and runs away from its responsibility. Even during the oxygen crisis, it was seen running away from its responsibility due to which thousands of people lost their lives across the country,” said Sisodia. The deputy CM said the country might have to face a terrible calamity as the entire system would come to a standstill and all industries would face a shutdown in the event of an energy crisis. Making an appeal, he said that governments run with cooperation and to overcome the present crisis as a nation, the Centre should adopt a “cooperative attitude”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-closing-eye-to-looming-power-crisis-just-like-o2-shortage-sisodia/articleshow/86920068.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Doctors at AIIMS said they recently saw an eight-year-old girl who had massive swelling in her kidneys. A blockage caused the swelling in the area that connects the renal pelvis — a part of the kidney— to one of the tubes called ureters that move urine to the bladder. Dr Shilpa Sharma, a paediatric surgeon at AIIMS, said the patient suffered from the blockage since childhood. “The family kept delaying visits to the hospital until the blockage grew to a point where she couldn’t pass urine at all. Her kidneys had enlarged due to the accumulation of urine . If she wasn’t operated upon soon, the child could have suffered serious complications and even died,” Dr Sharma said. The doctors said the operation involved draining the urine from the kidneys and clearing the blockage through a minimally invasive technique. The patient has recovered well and has been advised follow-up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-delays-hospital-visits-sparks-health-complications/articleshow/86921976.cms||---

He said that the state has sought 75% financial contribution of the total sum proposed to implement water management projects covering urban areas. “For urban areas, Jal Jeevan Mission says only 50% of the total fund will be provided. We do not have sufficient funds, no other state has. The union government must revise their contribution back to 75% as it was in the past. Only then, water projects will materialise,” K N Nehru said in Trichy on Sunday. While stating that mobilising funds is difficult for the state government reeling under debts, Nehru said that the government is keen to utilise funds available to fulfil poll promises. He added that the state has around 55% of its population residing in urban areas and is expected to increase to 60% in the next 10 years. “New check dams have been considered across the Kollidam river to increase the groundwater table level. TWAD board will prepare a DPR for a new check dam near Nochiyam in Trichy to store 8.75 TMC of water,” Nehru said. A detailed report seeking funds for a new check dam will be submitted to the Jal Jeevan Mission and the ministry of housing and urban affairs for addressing the drinking water needs. Reacting to a question on the conduct of the rural civic body election held recently, the minister said that the election was conducted in a fair and transparent manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/more-funds-sought-under-jal-jeevan-min/articleshow/86921988.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Overflowing dam may delay start of bird ringing project||Aurangabad: While Jayakwadi bird sanctuary is one of the wetlands in Maharashtra identified by the experts to carry out the bird ringing and colour flagging project, the overflowing dam may delay the start of the related activities. The special research project called ‘Elucidating the status of migratory waterbirds in ornithologically important wetlands of Maharashtra; Central Asian Flyway Perspective’ is being planned by the Bombay Natural History Society with support from the state forest department. It involves capturing 5,000 water birds comprising shorebirds, gulls, terns, cranes, storks, ducks, geese and flamingos along with land birds like buntings, starlings, warblers, flycatchers, larks, pipits, chats and cuckoos. Divisional forest officer (wildlife) Vijay Satpute on Sunday said Jayakwadi bird sanctuary usually starts attracting migratory birds once the water level in Nathsagar, the dam reservoir, falls below 80%. “Even if the migration period of birds starts since the beginning of winter, the nearly filled Jayakadi dam often shrinks habitats of birds, forcing them to choose another water body. Considering the extended monsoon this year, the bird ringing project may witness a delayed start,” he said. Besides Jayakwadi bird sanctuary, Nandur-Madhmeshwar wildlife sanctuary, Gangapur dam, Waghad Dam, Upper Vaitarna dam, Alandi dam, Kashyapi dam, Hatunr dam, Ujjani dam and Visapur dam are identified wetlands for the project. The state forest department, earlier in August, has issued the go-ahead to the BNHS for the project by giving a ‘permit to hunt for special purpose’. The project will be carried out till August next year. “So far, we have not received any official communication about the execution of the bird ringing or colour flagging project. The same is expected shortly once the rain subsides,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/overflowing-dam-may-delay-start-of-bird-ringing-project/articleshow/86918106.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Gurgaon||Relief On Horizon For Delhi-Ggn Commute: Ambience Mall Underpass To Open This Week||Gurgaon: After missing several deadlines, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is likely to open the U-turn underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza near Ambience Mall on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway to the public this week. A longstanding demand of local residents, the 377-metre-long four-lane underpass will help commuters to avoid going to Rajokri in Delhi for taking a U-turn to reach Ambience Mall, DLF Cyber City and its adjoining areas. Currently, commuters have to travel an additional four kilometres to take the Rajokri U-turn, which during peak traffic hours can take an additional 45 minutes. The lengthy route also exacerbates traffic congestion at the Delhi-Gurgaon border. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which began constructing the underpass in January 2019, had set an initial deadline of 18 months for completion of the project but officials said the work on the underpass was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a subsequent shortage of labour, repeated bans on construction due to high pollution levels, waterlogging due to heavy rainfall, and the delay in shifting toll gates and other utilities. On Sunday, an NHAI official told TOI, “Most of the work on the underpass has been completed and the remaining is being expedited. Only road carpeting is to be done, which is expected to be completed in the next few days. We hope to complete the construction by October 15.” Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, during a visit to Gurgaon in September to inspect the construction of the Delhi-Mumbai expressway, had announced that the underpass would be opened by October 15 and “will provide relief to people in both Delhi and Haryana”. “The underpass is almost completely ready, only the wearing course remains to be completed in the box portion of the underpass. Apart from this, everything else, including signage and lights, has been completed,” another NHAI official said, adding that work to clean the underpass started Sunday. The underpass is being built at a cost of Rs 102.94 crore, with the expenditure being shared by NHAI (50%), Ambience (25%), and DLF (25%). The structure is a part of a larger project to decongest the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. A second structure planned as a part of the project — a U-turn flyover at Shankar Chowk — was inaugurated in November last year. Ambience Island resident Partha Chatterjee said he had taken a house near the border to ensure that both Delhi and Gurgaon would be easily accessible. “This underpass will ease my life massively,” Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/relief-on-horizon-for-delhi-ggn-commute-ambience-mall-underpass-to-open-this-week/articleshow/86922073.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Police said the girl’s 52-year-old father Manikandan and his friend Karthi have been arrested and booked under five sections including the SC/ ST Act. The incident happened on Konulampallam road near Kamatchipuram on Saturday evening where the victim Prabakaran, his friend Dayanithi and the two accused came together. Police said Manikanadan had asked Karthi to bring Prabakaran, a resident of Vettamangalam village, over to discuss certain things. Dayanithi also accompanied Prabakaran when they met around 7 pm. According to the complaint lodged by Prabakaran’s elder sister E Priyanka with Panthanallur police, both Manikandan and Karthi suddenly launched an attack on Prabakaran with a liquor bottle and stabbed him with a knife. This was conveyed to her by Dayanithi who escaped from the scene. Soon, their relatives rushed to the scene and took Prabakaran to Kamatchipuram PHC from where he was shifted to Kumbakonam GH but doctors there declared him brought dead. The complaint said Prabakaran and Manikandan’s 17-year-old daughter, who studies in Class XI in a government higher secondary school, were in a relationship. On coming to know of it, Manikandan, a welder and resident of Kamatchipuram West Marathurai, had warned Prabakaran a couple of times that he would face dire consequences if he continued the relationship. Based on the complaint, inspector SR Om Prakash registered a complaint and further investigation is on. Thiruvidaimaruthur deputy superintendent of police S Vetriventhan told TOI that the accused have been booked under sections 342, 324, 302, 109 and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) amendment Act 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dalit-man-stabbed-to-death-near-kumbakonam/articleshow/86922057.cms||---
---||Trichy||Will ensure uninterrupted power, says Senthil Balaji||Trichy: Electricity minister V Senthil Balaji said at Trichy airport on Sunday that the state government will ensure uninterrupted power supply to domestic and industrial consumers despite the prevailing coal shortage across the country. Stating that power availed through private thermal power plants has declined due to coal shortage, the minister said his department is taking alternative measures to increase production. “Thermal power plants in the state require 56,000 tonnes of coal daily, but we are sourcing 60,000 tonnes a day. We have adequate stock to manage electricity production for four-five days. Usually, we stock coal for 15 days but due to a new restriction by the Centre based on the proximity of a state to coal mines, the stocking capacity has been revised to six days,” Balaji said. He added that the state government had signed an MoU with private thermal power plants to source 2,830 MW of power, but was getting only 1,300 MW due to coal shortage and constraints in importing it. “For now, we have taken up measures to ensure a seamless supply of power. To address the fall in power sourced from private thermal plants, our own production of electricity is being increased with the available coal stock,” the minister added. He said production at thermal power plants was increased to 70% from 43% in the past one month. “Coal shortage is a pan-India issue not confined to Tamil Nadu alone. The Union government should act. We are demanding the coal we are entitled to and they have to provide it,” the minister added. He said Tamil Nadu requires 16,000 MW of electricity daily. There was a 2,500 MW gap between production and demand. To fill the shortfall, the minister said that non-conventional electricity generation will be encouraged to produce 4,000 MW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/will-ensure-uninterrupted-power-says-senthil-balaji/articleshow/86922034.cms||---

The girl was said to have been suffering from severe abdominal pain since Saturday night and approached her mother when she was unable to bear the pain. Seeing her mother’s reaction, the girl went and took the extreme step by consuming rat poison. Rayaparthi sub-inpsector said that the girl’s parents, both agricultural labourers, had been out all day for work. “When they returned, the girl told them about her pain, to which her mother did not react well and warned her.

Sources said that the sub-committees, after a lengthy discussion and debate, proposed that KRMB should take under its control from October 14 Peddavagu project on Godavari river, and 29 projects, including Pulichintala, Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS), Srisailam, Pothireddypadu, Handri Neeva Srujala Sravanthi, Sunkesula, AMRP and Kalwakurthy projects on Krishna river, in AP and Telangana. However, the final decision would be taken at the full-fledged meetings of Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) to be held on October 11 and Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) on October 12 when the sub-committees would place their reports before them. On their part, Telangana officials are likely to put up a strong case before GRMB and KRMB in the next two days over the need to defer the “Centre’s takeover” keeping in view the withdrawal of its case in the Supreme Court and the likelihood of the jal shakti ministry referring Krishna water sharing dispute issue to Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-II) for delivering justice to the two Telugu states. Even chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced on the floor of the assembly on Friday that he had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union jal shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to defer taking over the projects on the two rivers. The CM also informed the assembly that the prime minister, home minister and jal shakti minister had assured him to do it. “Let’s wait and see. If that does not happen, then we shall take an all-party delegation to Delhi to meet the prime minister on the issue,” CM KCR said in response to the concerns raised by AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi over Telangana’s genuine share of river water.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana rejects NGT panel report on Palamuru||HYDERABAD: Telangana has rejected National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed joint committee findings on the Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme (PRLIS). The joint committee, in its report, had recommended environmental compensation of Rs 3.7 crore to be paid to Central Pollution Control Board towards violation of environmental norms, for constructing the project without environmental clearance (EC). Telangana was also directed to adhere to solid waste management rules and obtain EC. The committee opined that the drinking water was a minor component, whereas it was conceived as an irrigation scheme to lift 90 thousand million cubic feet (TMC ft) and the drinking water component was only 7.15 TMC. In his reply, special chief secretary, irrigation department, Rajat Kumar stated, “The finding of the committee that Palamuru-Rangareddy project is conceived as an irrigation scheme to lift 90 TMC of floodwater in 60 days from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir on Krishna river is incorrect. PRLIS is originally conceived for dual purpose, including providing drinking water to Mahabubnagar, Nagarkurnool, Narayanpet, Vikarabad, Nalgonda, Rangareddy and Hyderabad city and the proposed project also serves the supply of water to industries.” The Telangana government also stated that the irrigation part of the project would be taken up only after getting EC and it was at the state of public hearing and submission of proposal for EC. “The muck excavated from the proposed excavation of tunnels is being dumped within the project site, and the same will be utilised for manufacturing sand, revetment and concrete purposes. There is no need for having an environmental management plan to deal with the muck as stated by the joint committee in the report,” Rajat Kumar further stated in his reply. “People of Mahabubagar and Nalgonda districts are facing the problem of fluoride concentration in groundwater. The drinking water project is essential for them,” Kumar added. Telangana also told NGT that remedial measures mentioned by the committee were without any substance. “The reservoirs are built for 64.8 TMC, and water cannot be used for irrigation purposes since canal network is under planning stage only. The drinking water requirement as per DPR is 7.1 TMC. However, the water will be utilised for drinking water purposes in drought periods in as much as the flood is the rare phenomenon. The drawl of water and storing in the reservoirs may be once in four years,” he said. He also said two members of the joint committee had expressed different opinions and it has to be considered. J Shyamala Rao, secretary, water resources department, Andhra Pradesh, said, “PRLIS is an irrigation and not drinking water project. Telangana is misleading the tribunal and illegally constructing the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-rejects-ngt-panel-report-on-palamuru/articleshow/86923432.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

In 2020, there were 661 cases of snakebites at the civil hospital till September-end while in the same period this year, the hospital received 775 cases. Medical officials of the Nashik civil hospital attributed this to stricter Covid restrictions last year which may have forced the victims of snakebites to take treatment at the local hospitals, like primary health centres (PHC). M V Jadhav, a senior nurse at the emergency ward of the hospital, said, “The anti-snake venom is available at all government centres including at PHCs. However, the medical officers there at times suspect that the snakebite victim may need ICU treatment, ventilator support, etc following which patients are referred to the civil hospital.” She said the cure rate was good. Of the 661 snakebite victims admitted at the Nashik civil hospital till September-end, 18 have died. This year, of the 775 patients, seven have passed away. The flow of patients increases generally after April. Last year, there were 32 admissions related to snakebites in April, it increased to 60 in May, 80 in June, 157 in July, dropped 97 in August and showed a marginal rise in September with 105 cases. The trend was similar this year too. From 22 admissions in April, the number of patients increased to 75 in May, 133 in June, 151 in July, dropped to 127 in August and increased marginally to 130 in September. Tushar Chavan, the deputy conservator of forest (East), Nashik, said during the summer, snakes go deep into burrows to save themselves from the heat. However, in May-June when it rains, they come out of the water-filled burrows to find dry surfaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/more-snakebite-cases-at-nashik-civil-hosp-this-year/articleshow/86918166.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Jain maintained his claim that he used to meet her only for professional reasons. “We questioned him several times and even asked him about his photos with the girl where he is seen sitting close to her in a bed. Jain admitted that he went to her house several times, but added that he just met her for work and kept denying having any physical relations with her,” said a crime branch official. Cops said that Jain’s potency test will be also a key evidence in the case investigation. Regarding the missing memory card of the spy camera that was installed at the girl’s residence, the police said that the camera will be sent for FSL tests. “The camera has a memory card slot and so, we will try to ascertain if any card was inserted in it. Jain has said that he doesn’t have the memory card,” cops added. A team of cops has left for Mumbai on Sunday together with Jain to gather evidences against him. The accused will be taken to all the places where he had put up while on the run. If cops find evidence of anybody helping the fugitive while on the run, more arrests may follow, sources said. “Jain has also admitted that the rape survivor was involved in a land deal for which he was taking help of Bhatt. Bhatt is not an investor in Jain’s CA firm but was helping him in the land deal,” police officials said. The survivor, who is a student of a private university, had filed a case of rape against Jain and Bhatt on September 19.

If the momentum persists through Diwali and Christmas, this could turn out to be one of the best second half for malls in Kolkata, despite the three-month closure during the second wave. South City, Acropolis, and the two City Centres in Salt Lake and New Town have all recorded higher sales since mid-July than they did two seasons ago. Retailers at Mani Square and Quest, too, said they were very happy with the turnout of customers and sales. “We have had a phenomenal season with high sales across categories like apparel, watches and electronics,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. The mall had recorded a footfall of 1 lakh on Mahalaya and the weekends. At Acropolis mall too, revenue from festive sales crossed 2019 figures with the customer surge on the last lap of shopping pushing the numbers. “The final weekend before the Puja was fantastic with footfall of 25,000 a day. Compared to last year, festive sales are up more than 25%,” said Acropolis mall general manager K Vijayan, adding that apparel, footwear and beauty categories have done particularly well. City Centre I in Salt Lake and City Centre II in New Town have witnessed steady sales after the restrictions were eased. “Retail business has touched a new peak this Puja with patrons overcoming fears and walking into malls with confidence. Vaccination has played a huge role in the revival of retail business as there is no fear amongst the shoppers,” said Ramesh Pandey, wholetime director of Ambuja Neotia that operates the City Centres. The twin malls have clocked 15% more revenue than the 2019 festive season with garments, accessories, kids’ wear and women’s wear the biggest gainers. “CC-I is clocking around 1 lakh footfall while CC-II is getting around 80,000. Retailers, consumers and developers are pleased with the overall performance,” said Pandey. Though sales have exceeded the 2019 figures, footfall is still 60% of what malls had recorded during the festival two years ago. “The revenue per customer has increased sharply. There are more serious buyers visiting the malls and nearly everyone is making a purchase,” said Bagree. The food and beverage sector has also made a smart recovery with food courts and restaurants doing business at par with pre-pandemic levels. “Once the restrictions on timings were eased to allow service till 10.30pm, the F&B business was back on track,” Vijayan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-sales-cross-2019-figures-in-city-malls/articleshow/86922114.cms||Subhro Niyogi

But the BJP government at the Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it would not be able to take up caste-wise census of backward classes.

The party leadership has decided to organise a huge public meeting any day between October 23 and October 26. The Congress is writing to Election Commission of India (ECI) to allow it to hold a public meeting in the poll-bound constituency. If permission is not granted, the public meeting will be held in an area bordering Huzurabad constituency. The party has fielded student leader Balmoori Venkat who is state president of National Students Union of India (NSUI). Several members of NSUI have urged the party leadership to invite Jignesh Mevani, Kanhaiya Kumar and Hardik Patel to hit the hustings in Huzurabad. Kanhaiya Kumar recently joined Congress and Mevani has extended his support to the party. Hardik is presently working president of Gujarat Congress. “If EC does not allow public meetings, at least road shows of Kanhaiya, Mevani and Hardik should be held. Just their presence would give a major boost to our poll prospects of Venkat,” said a NSUI leader. The Congress leadership, which was in a dilemma over inviting the three leaders as the party has not won the seat in the last 30 years, has finally given in-principle nod to consult the AICC leadership over inviting Kanhaiya. Confirming to TOI that the party think tank has discussed the proposal, TPCC working president Mahesh Kumar Goud said, “We may invite Kanhaiya Kumar to the public meeting. The option of inviting Jignesh and Hardik too has been kept open. A final announcement would be made after Dasara.” While Balmoori Venkat has launched his campaign in Huzurabad, Mulug MLA D Anasuya too hit the hustings in the poll-bound constituency on Sunday and appealed to voters to give an opportunity to the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-likely-to-rope-kanhaiya-in-for-huzurabad-campaign/articleshow/86923179.cms||Roushan Ali

In the meeting, farmers and the administration reached an agreement that the entire episode would be investigated fairly by a team headed by Ambala Cantonment deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ram Kumar. A protest which had been called against the incident was later called off. On October 7, activists under the banner of BKU (Charuni) were protesting against Saini and state cabinet minister Mool Chand Sharma’s visit at Saini Dharamshala in Naraingarh when the alleged incident took place. Bhawan Preet of Bakala village submitted a complaint to Naraingarh DSP Anil Kumar over the incident. In a complaint against Saini and his driver Rajeev, Bhawan Preet alleged, “Rajeev had hit me with the car and threatened to repeat Lakhimpur Kheri if we protested again.” Farmers had given the call to gather at Naraingarh police station on Sunday if no action was taken on their complaint. Farmers gathered on the call, but the administration invited them to hold talks at the Naraingarh MC office and held two rounds of meetings. During the meeting, police handed over to farmers a stamped copy of their complaint against Saini and Rajeev, and also assured a fair probe. The closed-door meeting was held between five farmers led by BKU (Charuni) Ambala district president Malkiat Singh Sahibpura and Naraingarh SDM Neeraj, Naraingarh DSP Anil Kumar, and DSP Amit Bhatia, who had been deputed for the talks. Ambala SP Hamid Akhtar also met farmers at Shahzadpur when they were on their way to Naraingarh. He talked to them on the phone during the meeting and assured a fair probe. Till Sunday, no action was taken on Bhawan’s complaint. However, three FIRs were registered against farmers on October 8. In all of them, Bhawan Preet, Malkiat Singh Sahibpura, and others were booked by Ambala police at Naraingarh police station. Sahibpura confirmed the outcome of the meeting and so did Naraingarh DSP.

Several bars and restaurants have already sought the permission while many others are planning to do it on the eve of the Puja on Monday. With footfalls rising sharply across Kolkata’s restaurants over the last fortnight, restaurant-owners believe they will get enough crowds to justify a late-closure for both their bars and restaurants. A state government order on Saturday permitted bars and restaurants to enjoy relaxed timing from October 10 to 20. Majority of city bars have applied for an extension of timings. Some restaurants are planning to keep dining open till 3am during the four days of the festival. President of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar pointed out that following the order, restaurants can serve food till 2am-3am but bars can serve liquor till 12, unless they have an excise permission. “Bars can get an extension of up to 2 hours by applying to the excise department and have to pay an extra fee,” Poddar said. Poddar said that it would help in the revival of the industry. Incidentally, HRAEI had earlier written to the state government, seeking relaxation following the September 30 order relaxing night curfew on Puja days. The owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari, said he has already applied for late closure for a week. “Our bars will remain open for one extra hour. This weekend was really good and following the order, I am sure the next seven days would be the best in Covid times,” he added. T S Walia, the former national president of the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) and director of Wrong Place and Walson, feels this is the need of the hour. “We shall apply for extension at Wrong Place. The spirit is really high,” he added. Director of Aminia, Kabir Azhar, said that some of its outlets in Chinar Park, Hatibagan, Gariahat and Nager Bazaar will be open till 3pm during the festival. “We shall get a crowd till 3am and we shall keep some of our outlets open till late at night as we have been encouraged by the response from customers since Saturday night,” he added. Debaditya Chadhury and Siladitya Choudhury, managing directors of Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2, said, “For Chowman and Oudh 1590, we have curated a special menu for Puja. At Chapter 2, the bar will remain open beyond midnight.” Owner of Waldorf and Floriana, Charles Mantosh, has also applied for an extension of time for his bars. Pradeep Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore is also planning special menus for next seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-restos-apply-for-post-midnight-extension/articleshow/86922145.cms||---

It announced that if the compensation was not provided for crop residue management, farmers would be forced to burn paddy straw and would not let anyone stop them from setting their fields on fire. The other demands, addressed to the Punjab government and raised by the farm group, included: compenstion for cotton growers whose crop suffered in the latest pink bollworm pest attack in Punjab, expanding the benefit of government job for kin of people who have died in the ongoing farm agitation, no limit on purchase of paddy as is being announced, and taking back the condition of submitting land records for selling paddy in grain markets. The farm group said the Punjab government should offer jobs to kin of protesters who had died since June 5, 2020, when the three farm ordinances were passed and not the present November 26, 2020, when farm groups launched ‘Dilli Chalo’. Though demands for repeal of farm laws and sacking of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra too were raised, the rally was organised for demands pertaining to the state government. Leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha also participated in the rally. BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) state president Jagjit Singh Dallewal, while addressing the rally, said though farmers were more concerned about their fight against the central farm laws, they were also concerned about issues in the domain of state government. “We want state government to provide fair compensation for cotton crop loss without wasting time. The government must provide compensation and a job to kin of farmers who have died during protests as was promised and provide compensation for stubble managing or we will burn it,” he said, adding that the state government should not feel farmers might have forgotten demands pertaining to the state. BKU general secretary Yudhvir Singh, however, targetted the central government. He said BJP leaders must recall the time of 2011-12 when it had raised a voice against proposals of restructuring mandi system and opposed contract farming, saying it has caused losses to farmers in Europe. “Now they must answer how then black proposals have turned white now. This government has waived debt of several lakh crores of corporates, but has no money for farmers. In 2016, it was found that farmer suicides have increased by 42% and BJP government tried to gag the data,” he added. He said though Congress was the same, it was somewhat better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-group-to-punjab-govt-pay-for-straw-mgmt-or-fields-will-be-on-fire/articleshow/86922180.cms||Neel Kamal

Due to the pandemic, the pilgrimage to Hemkund had been allowed to start on September 18, three months after it usually starts. This year, 11,000 pilgrims visited the shrine, which is located at a height of 16,000 feet. On Sunday, the last day, around 1800 people thronged the shrine. Last year, too, the shrine had opened in mid-September and 8,500 people visited it in the short time that it stayed open. Hemkund Sahib closes for winter as the area becomes difficult to access due to snowfall. Provided the situation returns to normal next year, the portals will open in May next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hemkund-sahib-closes-after-staying-open-for-less-than-a-month-during-which-11k-pilgrims-visited/articleshow/86920229.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||New building will be ‘real Parl’: Central Vista architect||New Delhi: Urban designer and architect of the Central Vista redevelopment project, Bimal Patel, on Saturday said the new Parliament building will be the “real” Parliament of India. Speaking at an event organised by a private TV channel, where Union housing minister Hardeep Singh Puri was present, Patel said, “The present Parliament building was a Council House meant to house very few people, which we repurposed as Parliament. For the first time, we are getting a real Parliament for India.” Patel said the current Lok Sabha was designed for only 150 MPs, which now accommodates over 500 of them, adding there is “simply no space”. Puri also said that the existing Parliament was designed to be the Council House of a colonial power. “These are hard facts,” the minister said, adding that the need for a new Parliament was felt earlier and the then Lok Sabha Speaker during the UPA government had written to the urban affairs ministry to plan a new Parliament building. Responding to a question from the moderator on the expenses related to the PM House component, the minister said a false narrative is being spread that the cost will be Rs 20,000 crore. He stressed the new buildings including the PM House, Vice President Enclave and nine other buildings along Rajpath will be “modern, sustainable and efficient”. “When I tell Bimal let’s retain one building, and Bimal says no it’s not efficient, I defer to his judgment,” Puri said. He refused to take the name of any building saying it would be “unfair”. There has been a lot of debate over whether the less than a decade old Jawaharlal Nehru Bhavan which houses the external affairs ministry will be demolished. TOI had on December 4 last year first reported the government’s plan to raze it to create space for a seven-storey building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-building-will-be-real-parl-central-vista-architect/articleshow/86922185.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Randhawa hits out at BJP over move to shift Shillong Sikhs||Chandigarh: Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Sunday hit out at the decision of the BJP-backed alliance government in Meghalaya to “evict Sikhs living in Shillong’s Punjabi Lane” and accused the party of failing to create a sense of security among minorities in the country. Lashing out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, Randhawa said confidence among minorities was at its lowest across the country and they were feeling insecure, the latest examples of which could be seen in Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh. He said the environment of fear and discrimination created by the saffron party was against the spirit of the Constitution, which guaranteed equal rights to all. Randhawa decided to take up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. Randhawa opposed the recent decision of the NPP-led Democratic Alliance in Meghalaya, saying it was unjust. “The main aim of the Meghalaya government is to get the prime land worth several crores vacated by hook or crook and hand it over to land mafia,” he said and demanded a reversal of the decision. Randhawa had led a delegation to Shillong after it had become the epicentre of race riots in 2018 following a dispute between locals and Sikh residents of Punjabi Lane. He said these Sikhs had been living in Shillong for more than 200 years. Based on the recent recommendations of a high-level committee headed by Meghalaya deputy chief minister Preston Tynsong, the Meghalaya cabinet last week approved a proposal to relocate Sikhs living in the Thame Liu Malong area. “A small area has been earmarked by the government for the rehabilitation of Sikhs, which is not at all acceptable,” Randhawa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/randhawa-hits-out-at-bjp-over-move-to-shift-shillong-sikhs/articleshow/86922208.cms||---

Commissioner of police Deepak Pandey said all police personnel will be on their toes all through the day. Senior officials of all the police stations have been told to maintain strict vigil and deploy their maximum number of staffers on the field. Nashik city police have a force of around 3,200 personnel. Senior officials said maximum personnel of this force will be deployed on the areas, which are selected for protest. Meanwhile, the superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil said the bandobast will be stepped up in important places where the chances of protest rallies are more. The police would keep a special vigil on the highways passing through the district. He said apart from the regular force, the rural police have 800 home guards and a company of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF). Additional force is being deployed at certain locations where the probability of people coming on rail tracks is high but no such inputs are available yet, said Kshitij Gurav, the divisional security commissioner of Central Railway’s Bhusawal division. The situation would be monitored regularly and things would be worked out in coordination with the city police and the Government Railway Police. KS Patil, the divisional transport officer of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, Nashik division, said, “We have been asked to coordinate with local police based on whose recommendations the running of the buses would be reviewed from time to time.” Senior officials from the Nashik Municipal Corporation, which operates the bus service, said the decision of withdrawing the buses off the roads would be taken as per the situation on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-bandobast-in-nashik-district-amid-bandh-call/articleshow/86918245.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Delhi||Spraying of solution on farmlands to begin today: Delhi environment minister||NEW DELHI: Delhi government will start the free spraying of bio-decomposer solution in farmers' fields from Monday. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the campaign would begin from Fatehpur Jat village under the Narela constituency, claiming that farmers are excited about the solution after seeing its good performance. This time, the government has made preparations to spray the solution for stubble decomposition in an area of more than 4,000 acres in Delhi, whereas it was sprayed on about 2,000 acres last year. Rai said Delhi government had started the process of preparing the solution of bio-decomposer on September 24. It is being prepared at Kharkhari Nahar in collaboration with Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI). This year, the government is spending about Rs 50 lakhs in preparing and spraying of the solution, which is part of the winter action plan of Delhi government to control pollution. The Kejriwal government has appealed to all the states to bear the entire cost of spraying the bio-decomposer like Delhi government to help farmers. The whole process costs less than Rs 1,000 per acre. “Like last year, Delhi government is helping the farmers by spraying the bio decomposer for free. At the same time, stubble burning is done on a large scale in the neighboring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and its smoke has a huge adverse effect on the air of Delhi,” said Rai. The Kejriwal government had submitted a ‘third party audit report’ related to stubble management from bio-decomposer to the Central Air Quality Management Commission. WAPCOS, a central government agency, had conducted a third-party audit on the impact of spraying of bio decomposer on the stubble and described the bio-decomposer as a better solution for stubble decomposition. The CAQM has asked states to implement the bio-decomposer solution after seeing the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-spraying-of-solution-on-farmlands-to-begin-today/articleshow/86922224.cms||---

Police commissioner Deepak Pandey made police permission to put up hoardings and banners in public places mandatory from last month. A notification to this effect was issued on September 17. So apart from the permission from the Nashik Municipal Corporation, police permission is also necessary. Hence, all banners and posters put up in the city in public places will have the police permission number. However, at the time of the police issuing the notification, a large number of banners and hoardings were already put up. For such hoardings and posters, their owners were told to seek police permission till October 8 and put the permission number on the hoarding. On October 8, members of the Outdoor Advertising Welfare Association had demanded more time to take permission for the existing hoardings. On this backdrop, Pandey extended the deadline till October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deadline-to-seek-consent-for-banners-extended/articleshow/86918264.cms||---

The 28-year-old joins from Saif Sporting Club in Bangladesh. He made 21 appearances, scoring 11 and providing three assists for the Bangladesh Premier League side that were sixth in the 13-team league. Kenneth also has experience of playing in Cyprus, Iraq and Egypt. He will partner Guinean forward Sekou Sylla who has already joined pre-season training along with Lebanese centre-back Shadi Skaf. “He is (Kenneth) known as a renowned striker and we are looking for his combination with Sylla. We have made good impactful signings and have good Indian and Goan boys as well,” Churchill Brothers CEO Valanka Alemao told TOI on Monday. Brazilian midfielder Guilherme Escuro and Kenneth will soon join the team coached by Romanian Petre Gigiu, who has returned for a second stint with the club. Churchill are preparing to win their third I-League title after missing out narrowly to eventual champions Gokulam Kerala FC last season. The former champions are rebuilding the team after releasing all their four foreign players. “Hopefully we have a good squad. He is (Kenneth) a kind of a player like (Romelu) Lukaku. Of course, you cannot compare the two, but the way he runs, his physique is quite like him,” said Valanka. The I-League will be held in Kolkata for the second consecutive season due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The league will commence after the ongoing qualifiers concludes in Bengaluru on October 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/churchill-rope-in-nigerian-striker-kenneth/articleshow/86949741.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Citing an example of the neighbouring state of Haryana, Sharma said it is on record that Punjab does not give MSP on any crop while neighbouring Haryana gives huge benefits in forms of subsidy and provides MSP on 11 crops. “The economic health of the state can be gauged from the mere fact that it could not lift paddy even for four days. Finance minister Manpreet Badal has been vocal about the financial health of the state,” said Sharma. Speaking on the recent incident of Lakhimpur Kheri, he said the high command of the Congress — Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, and Akali Dal’s Sukhbir Singh Badal, Harsimrat Kaur Badal were trying desperately to politicise the issue and take petty mileage out of it. The UP government has announced a compensation of Rs 45 lakh to the families of the deceased and government jobs. He alleged while in Punjab, the state government gave Rs 5 lakh to families of the farmers who died during the farmers’ agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-does-not-give-msp-for-any-crop-haryana-gives-for-11/articleshow/86922251.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Power crisis in Punjab fallout of lack of planning, not coal crunch: SAD||AMRITSAR: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has claimed that the power crisis in Punjab was a consequence of “utter neglect and absence of advance planning and preparedness” and fallout of a “power crisis” within the ruling Congress too. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday said the power crisis was a part of the overall administrative paralysis gripping Punjab due to the ruling party’s internal politics. He went on to say that the power crisis was waiting to happen and it had nothing to do with the much-touted shortage of coal elsewhere. “The ministry of coal has clarified that there is no shortage of coal supplies in the country,” he said. He blamed the Congress government for not keeping the required reserves of coal to meet such situations. “This is what this Congress government is doing to Punjab, which we had turned into a power-surplus state,” said Sukhbir. Stating that the present power crisis was easily foreseeable and manageable if the government had the time and the will to prepare for it in advance, Sukhbir quipped: “They (Congress leaders) have wasted nearly five years either in power crisis within the party or in vendetta against political rivals. They believe that they don’t need to govern or to address the people’s problems and that they can regain power simply by putting Akalis in jail.” In reply to a media query regarding Navjot Singh Sidhu’s silent protest in Amritsar on Monday, the SAD president said, “He is a drama master. Even at Lakhimpur Kheri, he sat on hunger strike and observed silence for a night, sat on protest after dinner and broke it before breakfast.” During visit to Amritsar, Sukhbir paid obeisance at the Valmiki temple, Hanuman Mandir, Jama Masjid, Gurdwara Chheharata Sahib and Gurdwara Bohri Sahib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/power-crisis-in-punjab-fallout-of-lack-of-planning-not-coal-shortage-sukhbir/articleshow/86922261.cms||---
---||Pune||Post-runway work, no 24-hour operations at Pune airport till December 1||PUNE: Lohegaon airport director Santosh Dhoke on Sunday said the airport will not resume round-the-clock flight operations once it reopens on October 30, following a two-week closure for runway recarpeting work. “As per information received from the Indian Air Force, the flight operations will continue only in a 12-hour window daily till December 1, after which round-the-clock flight service will begin,” Dhoke told TOI. The airport has been operating only from 8am to 8pm since last October, when the surfacing work was first taken up. As per an initial plan, 24-hour operations were slated to begin from this month-end. The lack of flight operations between 8pm and 8am has been the main reason for flight bunching at the airport, leading to chaos, confusion and crowding at the airport’s check-in counters and security screening. The problem has become more pronounced since the number of flights increased in the last few months. Meanwhile, passengers continued to face trouble over rescheduling or cancelling their tickets booked for the closure window of October 14 to 29. “Since this was announced, I have been trying to call up a travel portal for options. Each day, I am put on hold for around an hour after which the phone automatically disconnects,” Arun Kadam, who had planned a trip to Jammu on October 20, said. He added, “Festive season is a time to celebrate with family, but we are all so stressed out as no one has been giving us any proper answers.” Queries sent to travel portals like MakeMyTrip and Yatra went unanswered. A spokesperson for EaseMyTrip, another portal, said, “We are awaiting an official statement from the airlines to provide clarity on the refund, rescheduling and rerouting of flights that have been cancelled due to the airport closure.” Holiday planning and booking websites Thomas Cook and SOTC said the festive season travel was likely to be impacted. “The Pune airport plays a key role across our business and leisure segments, and the closure will impact the festive season. Our teams have been updating our customers and rescheduling trips,” Indiver Rastogi, president and group head, Thomas Cook India and SOTC, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-runway-work-no-24-hour-ops-at-airport-till-december-1/articleshow/86922262.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Chandigarh||With Rs 500 crore pending arrears, Haryana resumes RTE admissions||CHANDIGARH: With unpaid arrears worth around Rs 500 crore pending, the Haryana education department has resumed admissions to private schools under the Right To Education (RTE) Act . The education department on Saturday released roster for district education officers and district elementary educational officers to start the process for registration and shortlisting of students to be admitted under the RTE Act. The move is consequent to litigation sought by Swasthya Shiksha Sehyog Sangthan, an NGO headed by Bhiwani resident Brij Pal Singh Parmar. He has moved the Punjab and Haryana high court as well as apex court against the Haryana government for discontinuing admissions under the RTE Act. Sources said till last admissions, there were around 1.87 lakh vacancies of students in 6,920 schools of state. Around 1.25 lakh applied for the vacancies in 2019-20. Since then, admissions were pending as the government discontinued RTE Act admissions. The government had been admitting these students to government schools of the state. “As a result, we moved the contempt of court and other proceedings; hence, the government has issued the circular and notices to resume admission process,” said Parmar. Resumption of admission shall once again pit the education department and the management of private schools against each other. The Federation of Private Schools Association of the state is already fighting legal and administrative battle for reimbursement of claims worth around Rs 500 crore on the account of the amount to be payable to schools for admitting students. According to schools, the government has not released reimbursements to a majority of schools since 2015-16 in the absence of a formula for finalising reimbursements to private schools. “We too have got the copy of the circular. We are in a fix, as we cannot say no to statutory orders and provisions. We shall adhere to it. But, how many students will apply in the mid-session now and how will we accommodate them? Managements of private schools are the most vulnerable stakeholder,’’ said Kulbhushan Sharma, president of the Federation of Private Schools associations of Haryana. “The government has not honoured its word of exempting or relaxing the property tax, no rebate in the electricity charges of past two years of lockdown and no moratorium has been given for loans. But, still we are forced to do all this. We shall be happier if the government starts clearing our previous payments and fixes formula of payment for the current session,” added Sharma. Meanwhile, state education minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar and ACS (education) Dr Mahavir Singh remained inaccessible. Other officers of the department refused to comment over the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-rs-500cr-pending-arrears-hry-resumes-rte-admissions/articleshow/86922260.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Chandigarh||‘Sack, arrest minister or face more protests’||BATHINDA: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday said summons issued to Union junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra were under Section 160 of CrPC, which is meant for witnesses. It said this showed he had not been arrested for murder, but for not cooperating in the investigation. SKM yet again demanded that Ajay Kumar Mishra be removed from the Union Cabinet and be arrested too. It set an October 11 deadline for the Centre to fulfil its demands failing which it would take up new ways to ensure its demands were met. SKM said Ashish Mishra not being arrested for murder did not instill confidence in the SIT probe, processes and arrest undertaken. “There is no information of any other arrests having been made, though other names of accomplices of Ashish Mishra,” stated SKM. The farm front, which has been spearheading the ongoing farm agitation, said all evidence had to be protected and credible way to ensure justice was to report investigation and legal action directly to the Supreme Court. Reactions from across the world: SKM The Lakhimpur Kheri killings have elicited strong response from justice-seeking individuals not just in India, but elsewhere too, said Sanyukt Kisan Morch on Sunday. Apart from reactions from parliamentarians in Britain and Canada, there were also protests by citizens in these countries to ensure that justice is not compromised in any way, stated SKM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sack-arrest-minister-or-face-more-protests/articleshow/86922288.cms||---
---||Pune||Woes galore for motorists at Visharantwadi chowk||Pune: Frequent traffic snarls at Vishrantwadi chowk have become a bane for daily commuters who have to wait long to cross the busy junction. Commuters said that bottlenecks and encroachment have led to slow movement of vehicles, especially on Dhanori and Alandi roads, where traffic has increased significantly in the last few years. Riders said they have to wait for at least two to three signals to cross the junction. Vijay Rathi, who travels from Dhanori to Shivajinagar daily, said, “Narrow carriageway and bottlenecks have led to huge traffic congestion at the chowk. The administration should widen the road. The situation may worsen in the coming days if steps are not taken as the vehicular traffic on the entire Dhanori road stretch is increasing day by day,” he said. Regular road users want officials to allow private vehicles to pass through the bus rapid transit system (BRTS) lanes during morning and evening. Ajay Chavan, an autorickshaw driver, said, “BRTS lanes have reduced the width of the lanes marked for private vehicles. The administration should allow BRTS lanes for private vehicles during rush hours or during traffic jams to help streamline vehicular movement.” Sayali Raut, who was caught in a traffic jam ahead of the chowk last week, said that almost every day some or the other road passing through the junction witness traffic jams. “There is need for a flyover or a subway so that vehicles do not have to stop at the chowk. It will be difficult to make space even for an ambulance in case of an emergency”, Raut added. The traffic police said that they have been deploying additional manpower at the chowk during rush hours. The officials said they will soon approach the civic administration to clear the encroachments and bottlenecks. “We are deploying additional force at the chowk as needed. Evening hours are very critical. The junction witnessed a huge increase in traffic,” an official from the traffic police department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woes-galore-for-motorists-at-visharantwadi-chowk/articleshow/86922293.cms||Sarang Dastane

This is the first year when Nashik was awarded a centre for the UPSC examinations. Resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode said, “The UPSC civil services prelims 2021 were conducted on Sunday at 10 centres. The examinations went off peacefully.” Member of Parliament (Nashik) Hemant Godse kept meeting the UPSC authorities to request an exam centre in Nashik as sizeable number of people attend the examination and conducting the examinations in Nashik would further inspire more candidates to appear for the same. The UPSC, thus, announced Nashik as one of the centres and the first examination was conducted on Sunday — in two sessions. Initially, the examinations were scheduled for June 27, but were postponed due to the second wave of the pandemic. A total of 3,445 candidates were to appear for the examination, out of which 2,474 turned up for Paper 1 that was conducted from 9.30 am to 11.30 am. “The number of candidates appearing the second paper dropped by 17 to 2,457. The candidates have to attend both the papers only after that the outcome is held valid,” a senior officer from the district administration said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-2400-appear-for-upsc-exam/articleshow/86918307.cms||---

According to Maharashtra Rajya Drakash Bagayatdar Sangh (MRDB), an association of grape-growers, production in over 80,000 acres of vineyards are expected to be reduced by over 20% to 6 tonne per acre against a normal yield of 8 tonne an acre. It means, farmers are expected to incur losses of around 2 lakh tonne of grapes due to heavy rainfall. “Over 50% of the vineyards in the district were on the sprouting mode and fruits had started developing in some of these vineyards. But the rains have badly damaged the vineyards and this will lead to a dip in yield of grapes,” Manik Patil, a senior office-bearer of the MRDB, said. Patil, who is also the director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB) and Grapes Exporters Association of India (GEAI), said farmers have started spraying activities to protect vineyards from diseases like downy. “However. there will be no damage to the vineyards where pruning is yet to take place,” added Patil. Khandu Shevale, a grape farmer, said farmers have been cultivating Thompson seedless, an old variety of grape, but many have also started planting colourful varieties. “Vineyards of these colourful grape varieties may be hit more and the yield may dip by 50%. Moreover, growth of other varieties of the vineyards are also expected to be affected.” Sharad Dhokle, a farmer from Dindori taluka, said he had four acres under jumbo black and flame seedless grapes. “These four acres of vineyards were in the initial stage of developing fruits. But the heavy rains have badly damaged my vineyards as fruits would not get developed and production losses will be huge,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/recent-rainfall-affects-50-vineyards-in-nashik-district/articleshow/86918280.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||10k passengers per day used Lohegaon facility last month||Pune: For the first time since domestic operations resumed in May 2020 after the initial Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, Pune airport in September this year has handled traffic of over 10,000 passengers each day. However, the impending closure of the airport from October 16 to 29 to facilitate runway resurfacing is bound to break this momentum, authorities said. “Passenger traffic in September 2021 rose by around 22% compared to the previous month. We were hoping the numbers would rise even further in October. However, all flight operations remaining suspended from October 16 to 29 during festive season is a cause of concern. The Indian Air Force (IAF) — which controls the runway and air traffic control (ATC) — has decided upon the dates. We follow them. But passenger traffic could hit the roof yet again right after the airport opens, just before Diwali,” an airport official preferring anonymity said. On September 19, the airport saw close to 15,000 passengers in a single day – the highest since May last year. Before the pandemic struck, the airport hosted around 25,000 passengers per day.  “The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will announce its winter schedule, which starts on October 25 and goes on until March-end. We are hoping for new flights, but then the closure could become a temporary hindrance. However, we expect passenger and aircraft movement to swiftly recover once operations re-start,” another airport official said. Flyers said that this phase is an opportunity for the authorities to get organised. “On Saturday, I was travelling to Trichy via Hyderabad on an IndiGo flight and the rush at the airport was scary. I could have missed the flight if other passengers had not helped me. Officials should think about ways to reduce the stress of flyers,” traveller Satya I said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10k-passengers-per-day-used-lohegaon-facility-last-month/articleshow/86922299.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Maharashtra bandh: Market shut, autos off the roads for today’s bandh; essentials normal||PUNE: The Gultekdi market yard and grocery shops across the city will be closed, while autorickshaws are likely to stay off the roads on Monday for the ‘Maharashtra bandh’, called by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) to protest against the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh. Restaurants and eateries will stay closed till 3pm, while sales and service related to essential commodities like milk, vegetables, fuel, and public bus services will operate. “Our priority will be to ensure that law and order is not disturbed, and the protest is held peacefully,” district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI on Sunday. “The city and the rural police have been told to be alert,” he added. Pune’s joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve said they have been assured of a peaceful protest by representatives of all MVA allies. “We have deployed 5,000 personnel on bandobast and posted State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), special teams and Quick Response Teams at vantage points. We will ensure that commuting on roads is normal,” Shisve. Pimpri Chinchwad’s additional police commissioner Sanjay Shinde said they will ensure no shop that elects to stay open will not be forced to shut. “Two SRPF platoons and 1,000 police personnel have been deployed across the Pimpri Chinchwad jurisdiction. We will also ensure there is no confrontation between rival political parties,” Shinde said. Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said they would strive to ensure smooth traffic movement on state and national highways. “There will adequate deployment to ensure that essential services are not disrupted. Traders’ associations have already said they will close their shops voluntarily. Our local police stations are in contact with them,” he said. Local functionaries of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — allies in the ruling coalition — resolved to protest peacefully. “We have told our workers not to disturb essential services in any form,” city Congress chief Ramesh Bagwe told TOI. The party functionaries have also appealed to various associations — farmers and rickshaw owners/drivers — to participate in the protest. Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of Gultekdi’s Agriculture Produce Market Committee, said, “All traders and commission agents have decided to participate in the bandh. So open auction of produce won’t be held. Since the intake of produce was adequate across all APMC markets in the city, retail vendors have enough stock. Citizens will not face a shortage.” Katraj Dairy chairman Vishnu Hinge said milk supply will continue as usual. “Our dairy supplies 1.25 lakh litres to Pune city each day. Transportation across the city and district will be smooth.” Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association, said, “We discussed this with our members; they have agreed to cease operations till 3pm.” However, five-, four-, and three-star hotels are going to remain open, said Sharan Shetty, president of the Poona Hoteliers Association. “We have pre-bookings and must provide service. Clients come from other cities. We can’t deny them too,” he said. Rickshaw Panchayat’s Nitin Pawar said autorickshaws will not ply. “Since almost all political parties are taking part in the bandh, we have decided not to operate.” Shrikant Acharya, president of the Aam Aadmi Party Rickshaw Chalak Sanghatna, said they will be taking out a rally on Monday. “We will hold rally from the RTO office to Alka Talkies Chowk.” However, cabs will ply on the roads. “Drivers now need business every day to survive. All cabs will be operational in the city,” Guru Katti, president of Swarajya Vahan Chalak Sanghatna, an association of cabbies, said. PMPML and MSRTC also plan to operate. “All buses will ply as per schedule,” PMPML’s traffic manager Dattatray Zende said. Private transporters too said they will function. “Not doing business even for a day is not a choice,” a representative of the Pune Bus Owners Association said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/market-shut-autos-off-the-roads-for-todays-bandh-essentials-normal/articleshow/86922266.cms||Sandip Dighe

GRP Itwari in-charge, assistant police inspector (PI) Mubarak Shaikh recovered the mangalsutra after spotting it around the neck of a woman from a nomadic tribe, who was part of a gang of robbers rounded up from the shuttle train from Itwari to Gondia. After learning the mangalsutra’s description, Shaikh identified its owner Sushma Kawale from the records and helped her get it back. “The thief belonged to a nomadic tribe whose members don’t wear gold mangalsutra, and also don’t dispose it. This knowledge led me to the chain around her neck,” said Shaikh. “The thief claimed that the mangalsutra belonged to her. So, I brought Kawale before her and told her about the victim’s devotion and poverty, following which the nomadic woman broke down and confessed to have stolen it,” said Shaikh. Kawale used to pray for the mangalsutra — which her mother gave her — and had a lot of emotions attached to it. She would prefer praying to God for it to be returned, instead of contemplating getting it replaced. “We had lost all hope despite our prayers when GRP’s help came as a surprise,” she said. A teary-eyed Kawale, 45, who earns Rs150 per day as a labourer at a betel nut factory, could not believe her luck while receiving the stolen mangalsutra from GRP police superintendent M Rajkumar at the police headquarters. Shaikh had earlier ensured that a national-level kabaddi player from Haryana got his cellphone back after two-and-a-half years. He had lost the phone at Itwari station in March 2019. Shaikh recovered the phone from Naxal-affected Gondia and sent it back to the player via courier. Kawale and the kabaddi player from Haryana are among the 52 people to whom Shaikh has returned their valuables this year. The valuables were stolen or lost in trains in the last few years. Around 41 people received their stolen mobile phones while another 11, like Kawale, received their stolen gold or other valuables from Shaikh after he took charge of Itwari police station. “In all, we have returned valuables worth around Rs6 lakh in the last six months,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-woman-gets-stolen-mangalsutra-back-999-days-later/articleshow/86922481.cms||Soumitra Bose

Punjab is facing acute shortage of coal forcing state-owned Punjab State Power Corporation Limited to imposed cuts. Sidhu took a potshot at private thermal plants, accusing them of violating guidelines and punishing consumers. Sidhu tweeted: “Punjab must prevent & prepare, rather than repent & repair… Private Thermal Plants floating (sic) guidelines, punishing domestic consumers by not keeping coal stock for 30 days should be penalised. It is time to aggressively work on solar PPAs, and rooftop solar (plnats) connected to the grid." Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had on Saturday lashed out at the BJP-led central government for insufficient coal supply and asked it to enhance state’s supply as per quota to tide over power crisis with impending shutdown of its thermal plants due to fast depleting coal reserves which are likely to exhaust within couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-penalise-plants-for-not-keeping-coal-stock/articleshow/86922289.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityThe air quality is expected to worsen due to increased farm fires and local and regional sources of pollution. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the capital was 168 on Sunday. L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said, “Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration has started showing an increasing trend, with daily average PM2.5 levels exceeding the permissible limit of 60 ug/m3 for the past three days. Estimates by urban emissions indicate open fires, transport and emissions from industries and power plants as the leading sources of pollution in the capital. Meanwhile, farm fires in Punjab and Haryana are also on the rise. Between September 1 and October 10, Satellites reported over 676 and 193 fires in Punjab and Haryana.” She added the farm fires were mostly spotted in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Patiala in Punjab and Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal and Ambala in Haryana. “In the coming weeks, with changes in meteorological conditions, emissions from local and regional sources would only cause deterioration in air quality. Therefore, Delhi government should use the air quality forecast and roll out GRAP measures in advance to prevent unhealthy air quality conditions in the city,” said Kurinji. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the union ministry of earth sciences, said, “The AQI is in the ‘moderate’ category with PM10 due to fire emission upwind along with local and regional dust under dry conditions. With the presence of such dry conditions, both fire emission and dust suspension are going to degrade it.” Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “The wind from the north, north-west is set to affect the air quality in the entire northern plains.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-quality-to-slip-into-poor-range-in-3-days/articleshow/86922292.cms||---

The matter came to light two days ago during the investigation of a woman’s complaint with the Washim police against Yogesh Itole, under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. During his questioning, Itole revealed that he had killed his elder brother, Gajanan (24), in Mulshi two years ago. The police then brought Yogesh to Mulshi, where he led them to the spot where the body was buried. The police on Sunday exhumed the skeletal remains of Gajanan. Sub-inspector Shrikant Jadhav told TOI, “The suspect killed his elder brother as he had developed a relationship with the woman whom the suspect wanted to marry.” He said that after the murder, the suspect had told his relatives that his brother had gone to Nagpur for a job. “No one bothered to check Gajanan’s whereabouts in last two years,” Jadhav said. Jadhav said that Yogesh and his brother were daily-wage workers. “Yogesh was in a relationship with a woman from his hometown. He introduced Gajanan to her, after which, they got into relationship,” Jadhav said. Furious, Yogesh hatched a plot to kill his brother. “In November 2019, Yogesh called Gajanan to Mulshi taluka, where their stepmother lives. He got Gajanan drunk and bludgeoned him to death and, with his cousin’s help, dragged the body into a jungle nearby and buried it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-confesses-to-brothers-murder-in-2019-body-exhumed/articleshow/86922324.cms||---

---||Delhi||Najafgarh lake fails water quality test, finds report||NEW DELHI: A report submitted by Wetland Authority of Delhi (WAD) to National Green Tribunal (NGT) says the water quality of Najafgarh lake does not meet the prescribed parameters with respect to pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) that will support propagation of wildlife and fish. As the lake falls in both Delhi and Haryana, NGT has directed both governments to ascertain the water quality status. The WAD report said the analysis of water quality done by Delhi Pollution Control Committee found pH at 5.06 and DO at 3.5 mg/l. The standard DO for a wetland is 4mg/l or more, while pH should be 6.5-8.5. However, the water quality met the desired criteria upstream where pH and DO were 7.44 and 7.5mg/l, respectively. The lake receives a continuous input of sewage from Gurgaon and surrounding villages of Delhi. WAD told NGT that it was awaiting a green signal from MoEF for executing its environment management plan (EMP) for preventing entry of untreated sewage, removal of encroachment and conservation of the waterbody. “According to Wetland Conservation and Management Rules, 2017, in case of trans-boundary wetlands, the central government shall coordinate with the state governments and Union Territory administrations. Delhi government asked MoEF in August this year to clarify if it could go ahead with the execution of EMP or wait for Haryana’s plan,” said the report. Though Delhi had submitted its EMP in December 2020, Haryana submitted its plan in September this year. The tribunal was also informed that an expert committee was examining Delhi’s EMP to identify actions that could be carried out independently. In EMPs of both Delhi and Haryana governments, most recommendations for immediate, medium (within 2-3 years) and long term (3-5 years) were almost the same. The common suggestions for immediate plans were notifications under wetland rules, boundary demarcation using geotagged pillars, constitution of Najafgarh Wetland Committee, constituting wetland mitras, commissioning hydrological assessment and species inventory and developing a comprehensive stakeholder-endorsed management plan. The medium-term plans included providing alternate road connectivity to settlements at two ends of Najafgarh lake, thus reducing vehicular traffic, especially during peak migration season of birds, conducting carbon and greenhouses flux assessments to determine the role of Najafgarh lake in climate change, installing signage at entry and exit and at key vantage points to communicate the value of the lake and dos and don’ts for people while being in the wetland. The common long-term measures included implementing ecological restoration measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/najafgarh-lake-fails-water-quality-test-finds-report/articleshow/86922376.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Today, children are immersed in cellphones and the internet. Thus, they remain deprived of quality education. If children read Sanatan’s holy texts, they will most certainly benefit from the same,” said Ticlo. The Sanatan Sanstha has brought out texts on various topics like spirituality, sattvik living, dharmashastra related to daily life activities, Indian culture, among others. To propagate these texts, Sanatan Sanstha is conducting a campaign ‘Dnyanshakti Prasar Abhiyan’ in Goa and throughout India. As a part of this campaign, Sanatan Sanstha members met Ticlo. “Every individual should take some time off and read these holy texts and participate in the ‘GyanShakti Prasar Abhiyan’ campaign. These holy texts will prove useful for readers of all ages. In today’s fast paced life, people are losing sight of moral values. I intend to buy Sanatan’s holy texts for furthering my knowledge and for my family,” Ticlo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-can-benefit-from-sanathan-sanstha-texts-says-glenn-ticlo/articleshow/86922461.cms||---

The two-hour long shower left low-lying parts of the city inundated. The city witnessed 13.6 mm of rainfall on Sunday. Many people said the thunders they heard on Sunday were louder than the ones they heard during the initial spells of rain in the season. Nashik city had been witnessing overcast skies in the past three days. Some parts of the city were receiving scanty to moderate rain. However, the showers on Sunday afternoon took everyone by surprise. Within a matter of few minutes two-wheeler riders and roadside vendors, who had put up their stalls, rushed to take shelter. The fire brigade officials said they have not got any call from city residents regarding water logging or trees falling in the city. However, many low-lying areas were inundated. Rainwater was also accumulated on the flyover in the Dwarka area. Due to the water accumulation on the road, the flow of vehicular traffic had slowed down as the motorists were trying to avoid the water-filled part of the road. Meanwhile, by 5.30 pm the rain subsided in many areas and it was limited to drizzle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-receives-heavy-rain-on-sunday-afternoon/articleshow/86918374.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Constable Suraj Shivaji Sule (28), posted with the rural police headquarters, said, “I had gone to a public sector bank near the bus stand. I was waiting for a bus when the man approached me and tried to pick my wallet.” “He gave me a hard push and managed to get hold of it, and ran away,” Sule said. Senior inspector Yashwant Gawari of the Bund Garden police said, “We spotted the suspect, Arun Bobade (26), at a roadside eatery near the railway station and nabbed him.” “We have registered a case of robbery against him,” the police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-robs-cop-of-rs-1100-arrested/articleshow/86922372.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Nice girls are encouraged not to talk about money’||The recent rash of arrests of economic offenders has suddenly thrown the spotlight on the wives, daughters and sisters who may or may not have been knowingly complicit but landed in jail or custody. The big question that is causing a flutter is: Do women know what they sign? Do they even have a choice? Or, do they choose to look the other way so as to not rock the proverbial family yacht. While the rest of the world is breaking old patriarchal patterns and even gender is becoming fluid, Indian women still seem to be floating somewhere in the spectrum between clueless and choiceless on financial and legal matters. “Most women don’t have a clue and I mean even educated working women,” says senior divorce lawyer Mridula Kadam. “I come across this all the time.” She cites a case where long after a divorce was done and dusted, a woman found out that she was liable for unpaid taxes in her ex-husband’s business. When the stakes are high, this attitude is widespread, note lawyers, adding that family businesses routinely make women figurative board directors and loan guarantors. Company law requires public companies have at least one woman director on their board. Recently, the wife and daughters of an alleged financial offender landed in Byculla jail; last week, a Delhi woman whose husband has allegedly done more laundering than an entire dhobhi ghat, was taken into custody by the Enforcement Directorate. “They may bully the vegetable vendor and endlessly shout at their drivers, but they will not dare to question their husbands or fathers because it means you are challenging the man’s abilities or so-called brilliance. And they know that the London and Maldives trips will stop. Then what are you going to do?” says a south Mumbai businessperson. “The only way you can say no to a bully is if you are financially independent, but even that will have repercussions in the bedroom.” Lawyers and consultants suggest that it might be better to empower yourself than end up eating watery daal in prison. “The time has come that before signing anything, you need to read and understand what you’re signing,” says Kadam. “If you do not underst-and the language, buy some time, take a screenshot, and ask someone — a lawyer, a friend, or a chartered accountant.”  Life coach Sujata Kabraji says she tells her women clients that one of the ways to ask is to say, ‘I just want to educate myself’. But she says that asking changes the texture of your relationship. Besides, what happens when you ask, and find out there’s something fishy, how do you then go back to your father-in-law or husband and disagree? “Clearly, there is no one solution to this. Each family dynamic is different,” she says. Although women intuitively do understand basic concepts about money, there tend to be psychological barriers compounded by the deliberate obfuscation in financial and legal documents which scare people away. Much of this has to do with conditioning, says author Monika Halan. “Nice girls are encouraged not to talk about money; probably because the subtext is that the money goes down the male line,” says Halan. “This happens even in cases where the woman is an MBA or a doctor. It gets a little worse in busin-ess families because the assets are larger and there may be assets that are not legitimate.” “Yes, consent is not sought, especially in business families where women enjoy the economic privileges,” says solicitor Naheed Carrimjee. “But I always say, you’re educated, so please read before you blindly sign a document. And if you are a director, as a moral responsibility you do have to take a little interest in what is going on, because there could be criminal implications,” she adds. “Remember, empowerment is a personal choice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nice-girls-are-encouraged-not-to-talk-about-money/articleshow/86924459.cms||Namita Devidayal
---||Dehradun||In a first in country, U’khand forest dept to train 1 lakh ‘ecopreneurs’ in hills||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand forest department will train 1 lakh residents in 10 hill districts to propel them towards ‘ecopreneurship’, a business practice driven not just by profits but also by a concern for the environment. The ecopreneurs will undergo training on conducting birdwatching, snow-leopard tours, nature walks and ‘ethical trekking’ in tough terrain, a move that is also aimed at generating income and stemming migration. The training sessions started earlier this week at Barsu village in Uttarkashi district. “There are 20 training modules, each with different learning material and duration. This initiative is the first of its kind to be undertaken by any forest department in the country,” said Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force, Uttarakhand. The initiative, kicked off a few days after Pushkar Singh Dhami’s announcement that a brigade of ecopreneurs will be built, is aimed at generating employment opportunities as well as running businesses in an eco-friendly manner. In the first phase, 26 men and women were imparted training on bird watching on Friday. They will continue to undergo periodic guided birdwatching trips for the next year. Similarly, residents in other districts will be trained in a different set of activities. Uttarakhand has a forest cover of 24,303 sq km, according to the Forest Survey of India. But it lacks a sufficient number of nature guides. The ecopreneurs will bridge this gap by giving snow leopard tours, butterfly trails and trekking experiences. Sanjay Sondhi of Titli Trust, whose team is training the youths in collaboration with the forest department in Uttarkashi, said, “The concept of ecopreneurs is highly relevant for Uttarakhand as the state needs initiatives that have a low ecological footprint and provide incentives to locals to conserve their natural resources. Sondhi added that training will also be imparted on ethical trekking tours, where only selected people go trekking and do not leave behind a trail of garbage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-in-country-ukhand-forest-dept-to-train-1-lakh-ecopreneurs-in-hills/articleshow/86920344.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Visakhapatnam||AP: Energy efficiency measures in industries worth Rs 1,200 crore||VISAKHAPATNAM: A recent audit conducted by the AP State Electricity Conservation Mission through The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has found enormous scope for energy saving in the fisheries sector. The audit was performed in the fisheries cluster in Bhimavaram of West Godavari district, consisting of 43 MSME units. The annual electricity consumption of these fisheries units is around 455 million units, which translates to an electricity bill of Rs 296 Crore. The State Energy Conservation Mission, the state designated agency of Andhra Pradesh, has conducted the pilot energy audit in two fishery units Ananda Enterprises Pvt. Ltd and Kader Exports. The audit identified energy savings to the tune of 1.45 MU with an investment of Rs 1.37 crore within a simple payback period of one year. This will reduce 1,306 tonnes of Co2 emissions. The state industries department has now set itself on the objective of unlocking this huge energy saving potential in MSMEs by improving energy performance and identifying the scope for introducing latest energy efficiency technologies. The department has recently given directions to the state and district level officials to take necessary steps to motivate industries and MSMEs to go for energy audits and implement energy efficiency measures. As per the orders given by the industries department, the energy efficiency measures in MSMEs and large industries in Andhra Pradesh would help to save around 2,000 million units of energy worth Rs 1,200 crore. Special chief secretary, industries and commerce department, Karikal Valaven, issued orders to the director of industries and general managers of the district industries centres to utilise the services of AP State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation Limited (APSEEDCO), a joint venture of AP government and AP power utilities, in conducting investment grade energy audit in large industries and MSMEs. “The MSMEs are the critical growth drivers of the economy. Lack of access to latest technologies made this sector vulnerable to energy security and competitiveness in the global market. The energy saving potential is immense in MSMEs that needs to be unlocked for which the MSMEs and industries should come forward to grab this opportunity,” said Valaven.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/energy-efficiency-measures-in-industries-worth-rs-1200-cr/articleshow/86920351.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Clogged concrete manhole covers leave Kalyaninagar waterlogged||PUNE: Before Saturday, Kalyaninagar residents had rarely seen knee-deep stagnant water on their well-laid internal roads. Often looked up to as a model for planned development in the city, the inundated roads left them angry and aghast. The water refused to recede for hours, blocking streets and entering some houses. Distressed citizens took to the streets on Sunday morning over the previous evening’s nightmare. They blamed the poor storm water drainage system and the concrete manhole covers that replaced the wrought iron grilles that were stolen last month for blocking the water from entering the drainage lines, and thus remaining stagnant on the roads for hours. They said garbage stuck in the holes of the concrete covers had hindered the flow of water. Civic officials, who visited Kalyaninagar on Sunday, promised immediate cleaning of the choked drainage lines and the replacement of concrete drain covers with wrought iron grates. Replacing the drainage pipeline coming from the nullah in Lohegaon and Dhanori with bigger pipelines was stuck in the tendering process, civic officials said. Santosh Tandale, superintendent engineer of the Pune Municipal Corporation, said that notices will be served to commercial establishments that have encroached upon or sealed the drainage conduits. “The storm water pipes running between lane 12 and 11 will be cleaned and water flow shall be regulated. The drainage pipe work connecting to the nullah will start by November 15,” he added. Rachana Agarwal, a resident of Kalyaninagar, said that a cloud burst in Dhanori-Lohegaon area added to the volume of water. “The water in the nullah touching Palace View Society in Kalyaninagar brought all the trouble to the residents. North Avenue and the lanes adjoining it, being at the lowest before the water empties into the river, bore the brunt. The concrete drain covers did not let water flow through,” she said. Ajay Bulbule, another resident of Kalyaninagar, has been pursuing the nullah troubles and storm water drainage system in the area for many years with the civic authorities. He said, “This whole storm water drainage system right from the nullah at Lohegaon, down to the river needs an overhaul. The entire North Avenue was flooded, including lane 13. We need to rope in water management experts to advise the PMC and the entire infrastructure needs to be upgraded.” Corporator Yogesh Mulik, who visited the sites on Sunday morning, said that based on the weather forecast for the next few days, he has instructed the ward office to replace the concrete manhole covers immediately with iron ones. “That will be done in a day or two. The nullah project has received sanction but is stuck in the tendering process. The PMC department has assured of completing the work in a month’s time. We shall follow it up,” Mulik said. MLA Sunil Tingre promised a survey of Kalyaninagar and the various dangerous spots that led to the situation on Saturday night and a plan for rectification. Former corporator Minal Sarvade said the PMC’s monsoon works were laid bare. “The PMC did not use mud pumps to remove the stagnant water on Saturday which then entered homes,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/clogged-concrete-manhole-covers-leave-kalyaninagar-waterlogged/articleshow/86922446.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The footage shows a man setting the factory on fire. The accused has been arrested. On Friday, the fire department had received a call at 3.45am and 18 fire tenders were rushed to the spot. “Cotton, thread and cloth waste kept at the basement, ground, and first floor of the building were gutted. No casualty was reported,” an officer said. According to police, a truck and an auto-rickshaw were also set ablaze. Later a case under section 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) of IPC was registered at Okhla police station. During investigation, police scanned CCTV footage of the area and found that a person came near the factory. After some time, he lit a matchstick and threw the burning stick inside the factory. The combustible materials, which were kept at the spot, caught fire and the person fled. Another person was also seen in the footage. Police are also probing his role. Accused Gulfam, a resident of Okhla Phase-2, told cops that he went to the spot with an associate and both of them were drunk. He said he was hired by someone for the work. The person told him that he could get money if he set the factory on fire. “He is a drug addict we are verifying his statement,”an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/okhla-factory-fire-2-days-on-man-held-for-arson/articleshow/86920366.cms||---

---||Goa||India pip Nepal to stay alive in SAFF Cup||Sunil Chhetri struck late as India got the better of Nepal 1-0 to keep their hopes alive in the SAFF Championship at the National Stadium in Male on Sunday. The India captain was having a disappointing night by his standards with two misses in either half. Yet, if someone could break Nepal’s resolve, it had to be Chhetri. That happened only in the 82nd minute with India, the highest-ranked team in the subcontinent, staring at an early exit. Just when everything seemed lost, Chhetri measured up to the challenge as he volleyed home a flick from Farukh Chaudhary. The win helped India accumulate five points and move to third on the table. The seven-time champions will qualify for the final if they can defeat hosts Maldives – leading the table with six points -- in the deciding group clash on Wednesday. Nepal are second with six points. They too can book a final spot if they pip Bangladesh, who have four points and can qualify with a win as four teams are left to battle for two places. Sri Lanka are the only side to have been knocked out. India could have so easily joined them, or at least left at the mercy of other teams. Coach Igor Stimac made several changes as he started with Brandon Fernandes, Yasir Mohammed, Lalengmawia Ralte and Mandar Rao Desai. India had control right from the start, but as has been the case since the opening round, there was no sharpness in front of goal. Chhetri had the best opportunity in the 35th minute when Suresh Singh, meeting a through ball from Pritam Kotal, cut it back for his captain across goal. On most days, with an open goal in front of him, he would have hammered it home, but his left-footed tap-in shockingly went out. Manvir Singh then missed two headers, the second from handshaking distance as goalkeeper Kiran Limbu made a smart save. The Nepal goalkeeper, however, could only watch as Chhetri gave the finishing touches when Brandon looped a ball inside the box and Farukh’s header fell into his path. On the sidelines, Stimac, and the rest of the coaching staff, celebrated. But the job is far from done as Maldives awaits on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-pip-nepal-to-stay-alive-in-saff-cup/articleshow/86922444.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: High premiums hit conversion of collector’s land to freehold units||MUMBAI: The state government’s scheme to convert collector’s land to freehold land has received poor response. Since March 2019, when the scheme was introduced, only one co-operative housing society and 18 individuals have opted for it. The individuals who have opted for it are rich and can afford to pay 25% of the Ready Reckoner Rate as premium. Over 1,250 such plots have been given by the government to individuals and housing societies in south Mumbai, and only 19 plot holders have sought conversion to freehold. “There are 3,000 housing societies on ‘occupancy class II lands’, or ‘collector’s land’, across Mumbai. Yet only one co-operative housing society, in Mazgaon, has opted for the scheme,” said Salil Rameshchandra, founder president, Federation of Grantees of Government Land.The reason is not far to seek. Niranjan Hiranandani, who got his occupancy class II land on Malabar Hill converted to freehold land, put on record, “The price I am paying is more than I should have paid.” Hiranandani said the land was bought by his father who also built the family home and named it after his wife Kanta (Nirajan Hiranandani’s mother). “I still live in this home. For me this was a sentimental thing. Had I been living in a society, maybe I too would not have paid such a high premium for the conversion to freehold,” he said. There are two types of lands -- leasehold and occupancy. Leasehold lands are those given on lease for a particular period on an annual lease rent. Occupancy lands are of two categories — class I and II. These were purchased from the government at the prevailing market rates. However, class I lands have no restriction on sale and purchase and are freehold lands. Class II lands were introduced by the British in 1901. These are meant to be used for the purpose they were intended for. Post-independence, the government continued to give class II lands, largely marshy lands, on the outskirts of cities to co-operatives for housing societies. People not only reclaimed the land to build their houses but also laid civic infrastructure such as roads, drains, and street lights at their own cost. However, for every sale, purchase, and mortgage, permission of the collector is mandatory. Rameshchandra said the premium being charged by the government is prohibitive. “Though most of these housing societies are in a dilapidated condition and in urgent need of redevelopment, the high premium makes the entire redevelopment project unviable. Depending on the year the land was given, the premium is 10% or 15% of the RR Rate,” he said. Hiranandani said residents saw no value in paying such a high amount to convert land to freehold. “If Air India can be privatised, why not all these occupancy class II lands? Residents are not going to use it for any other purpose. The government must make all such lands freehold,” he said. The conversion scheme comes to an end in March next year and thereafter the premium will increase to 60% for housing societies and 75% for individuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-high-premiums-hit-conversion-of-collectors-land-to-freehold-units/articleshow/86924462.cms||Clara Lewis

Minister for water resources Roshy Augustine has ended up furnishing almost similar replies within a span of three months regarding the status of the project in the assembly. As per the latest reply in response to a question by MLA Kadakampally Surendran, Kiifb, which is funding the scheme has sought a justification report from WAPCOS, the special purpose vehicle for the project (SPV), to explain why the company which qualified in the bid quoted more amount than that was approved by Kiifb. The minister told the assembly on October 6 that the contractor will be finalised once Kiifb approves the report. WAPCOS representatives did not comment on the present status of the project. Earlier the project had to be retendered after initial notifications evoked poor response. As per the assembly documents, a firm based in Hyderabad qualified in the bid and that there were three participants. However, the kiifb had given in-principle nod of Rs 185.23 crore for the project and the first phase of Rs 64.13 crore was also approved by Kiifb. The firm, however, quoted Rs 185.7 crore and in July, a negotiation on rate was held with the company following which the firm submitted a revised rate of Rs 183.46 crore. Kiifb reviewed the revised rate in September and sought a justification report from WAPCOS regarding the increased rate quoted by the firm. Except for the part regarding the justification report, the minister repeated verbatim all other aspects regarding the project when Kadakampally Surendran raised the query in July. The project has to be implemented in design, build, operate and transfer mode. As per the scope of the project, the scheme plans to rejuvenate the Akkulam lake and its environment in a sustainable manner and thereby transform it to an environmentally friendly iconic tourist destination and to conserve water resources of the lake and its connecting streams as far as possible using green technologies. The detailed project report prepared by Government Engineering College, Barton Hill, and Translational Research and Professional Leadership Centre (TPLC) lays key focus on cleaning the lateral drains and streams leading to Akkulam lake. The rejuvenation of the lake has been proposed by integrating rejuvenation of it and associated streams from the sub watersheds that carry discharge into the lake. As per the DPR, the total area of the Akkulam watershed draining to Akkulam lake is 135 sq.km. This includes Ulloorthodu, Pattomthodu, Pazhavangadithodu Medical Collegethodu and Thettiyarthodu. The water quality analysis has revealed the toxic conditions existing in the Pazhavangadithodu which is caused by the 12 major lateral drains bringing sewage into it as well as the excess solid waste dumped into the stream. The study report advocates two aspects for the rejuvenation of Akkulam lake; conveyance of water through the system during the dry periods (lean periods) with a desired water quality to be maintained in the stream and lake for the existence of flora and fauna and conveyance of water safely through the drainage system during rainy reason so that flooding is kept minimum in the areas adjacent to the streams and lake. The project aims to have decentralised water treatment facilities for each stream after water quality analysis revealed huge quantities of pollutants in streams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-year-after-tender-no-takers-for-akkulam-project/articleshow/86898863.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Rejecting allegations of the raids being politically motivated, Somashekar said that the income tax officials were acting on the information they had. “When agencies raid the houses and offices of leaders of the opposition, these operations are often alleged to be politically motivated. This had happened when DK Shivakumar’s properties were raided too. Those who have made mistakes must pay the price,” the minister said. On the BJP’s decision not field a member of late MLA CM Udasi’s family in the Hangal assembly constituency, Somashekar said that it was a decision taken by the party’s central leadership, which everyone had to abide by. On the disgruntlement within party ranks over the appointment of the Bengaluru development minister, Somashekar said, “Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will take the call on the issue. Revenue minister R Ashoka has been with the BJP, while the other aspirants for the post have come from other parties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/income-tax-raids-not-politically-motivated/articleshow/86920339.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi leads NCR cities in clean-fuel switch||NEW DELHI: All identified industries in the capital have switched to cleaner fuels or PNG, but the neighbouring states are yet to shift to cleaner fuels completely. Experts said the use of non-cleaner fuels in the authorised or illegal industries in the region can affect Delhi’s air quality. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), Delhi has now completely switched over to PNG or cleaner fuels for all of its 1,635 identified industries. However, NCR is lagging behind as Haryana has shifted 408 industrial units to cleaner fuels from 1,469 identified units. In Uttar Pradesh, of 2,273 identified ones, 1,167 have switched to cleaner fuels. In Rajasthan, 124 industrial units out of 436 identified industries have shifted to PNG. According to a source apportionment carried out by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) in 2018, industries' contribution to PM2.5 in Delhi was 3% and in NCR was 24%. Similarly, the share of industries to PM10 was 2% in Delhi but 28% in NCR. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the agencies should ensure that the banned fuels are not used in authorised or illegal industrial units. “As the use of non-cleaner fuels in the industries can cause air pollution, the agencies should enforce the ban and focus on surveillance of industrial units. A transparent inventory should be prepared on the usage of fuels in industries, including small-scale industries.” To mitigate industrial pollution and minimise the use of coal in the industries, CAQM has advised the government of Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan to prepare an action plan for shifting of industries to cleaner fuels in the NCR districts, where gas infrastructure is already available. The action plan is also being pursued to bring in PNG infrastructure to industrial areas where gas is not available. Strict vigil on the use of unapproved fuels by enforcement agencies are some of the important measures. Delhi government has also asked the neighbouring states to use cleaner fuels in the industries. Environment minister Gopal Rai said, “All industrial units in Delhi are operated on PNG. We appealed that industrial units operating in NCR be operated on PNG so that increasing pollution can be reduced. This target has been given to other states, but due to loose monitoring and inefficient transferring of work between units, we have requested them to hurriedly work on this to curb industrial pollution.” An official of Delhi Pollution Control Committee said, “We have started a drive to ensure that no industry uses non-cleaner fuels and pollutes the air through emissions from industries. We recently served notice to two units, and our drive against non-cleaner fuel in the industries will continue till February.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-leads-ncr-cities-in-clean-fuel-switch/articleshow/86920408.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

For many who turned towards home after the launch, it was as if the Old City had been left in the past on the platform while rest of Hyderabad was on a ride towards its future. “I remember looking at the Metro and feeling that people from the Old City have missed the bus. Although locals had initially opposed it, by the time the Metro started everyone wanted it as they could see the benefits,” said Abu Bakar, a student from Golconda. But from 2008 when it was proposed, Hyderabad Metro has faced many derailments even before it could reach the tracks. The opposition from locals and traders in Old City was the biggest hurdle, as many feared loss of property and religious structures. After several meetings, opposition from Sultan Bazaar traders was tackled and a plan was rolled out with alignment readjustments. However, the 5.5 km stretch from MGBS to Falaknuma via Dar-ul-shifa, Ashoorkhana, Mandi Road still remains on paper. “...Many who initially opposed it are ready to hand over properties. But now there is no clarity on the project,” said Mohammad Zubair Ali, a blogger from Charminar. Metro sources too have revealed that the Old City plan was uncertain. “L&T has clearly said that with so much of losses, they are not keen on completing the project. The government is working on an alternative. But as of now the fate of the MGBS-Falaknuma route hangs in the balance,” a source close to the matter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-yearns-for-metro-to-put-life-back-on-track/articleshow/86920561.cms||Amrita Didyala

The Centre's supply principle in the ratio of 75:25 for public and private vaccination will remain applicable for this vaccine too. “If there are buyers, up to 25 lakh doses of the ZyCoV-D would be made available to private sector hospitals every month as the initial monthly vaccine availability will be 1 crore doses,” N K Arora, chairman of the Centre's Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) told TOI on Sunday. However, 75% of the available doses would be reserved for vaccination of eligible adolescents at public vaccination centres for free, Arora clarified. The needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, has received emergency use authorization for being administered to children aged 12 years and above in India. The three-dose vaccine is to be administered with a 28-day gap between each dose. ZyCoV-D is going to be introduced in the country's Covid vaccination programme by October 20. “The biggest hurdle or challenge about this vaccine is its slow production. Initially, the manufacturer can only make available one crore doses every month. Private hospitals can procure 25% of the monthly production of ZyCoV-D from the manufacturer,” Arora said. However, he added that the private sector had not shown much interest in vaccine purchases after the new guidelines about Covid-19 vaccine supply in the ratio of 75:25 came into effect a few months ago. Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers in India keep the central government informed about their production plan in advance. This helps the government better plan the procurement and distribution. The Centre also knows about a consolidated demand from the private sector, as state governments collate the demand and indicate it to the authorities. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Pune-based Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “Private hospitals will purchase the ZyCov-D vaccine, but this time they would be cautious in their approach. Initially, the purchases are likely to be smaller in size to assess the response. Again, the vaccine cost in private hospitals will also determine its uptake.” Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Hospital in Pune, said, “The private hospitals' purchases of the ZyCoV-D vaccine is likely to be slow initially. It is a three-dose vaccine, hence the vaccination cost is likely to be high which may also negatively impact purchase in the private sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/25l-zycov-d-doses-every-month-for-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/86922503.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Official preparedness mitigates cyclone impact||VIJAYAWADA: Over the past 10 years, the Krishna district administration has succeeded in minimising damage caused by cyclones. This includes strengthening the cyclone warning system and early preparedness to minimise human loss. The district, which lies at the intersection of the Krishna river and the Bay of Bengal at Hamsaladeevi, is a dangerous zone in terms of cyclone landfall. The cyclonic storm that hit the Diviseema region in November 1977 still stands out as a nightmare for long-time residents. Around 10,000 human lives were lost and 10 lakh animals and livestock died in the storm. Both state and Union governments have identified the area as a cyclone-prone region and taken several steps to minimise damages. A weather forecast station was established at Machilipatnam and the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Amaravati centre monitors the formation and movement of cyclones. Residents of coastal villages, comprising mainly fisherfolk, are relocated to schools and community halls as soon as the IMD issues a cyclone alert. “Cyclones have become part of our lives. Earlier, hundreds of cattle used to die and we used to run away from the villages to save our lives. The government and voluntary organisations have helped through a system of early warnings and shifting us and our cattle to safe areas. Not even a single death due to cyclones was reported in our village after 2000,” said Vissamsetti Raghu, a fisherman from Palakayathippa. However, officials are yet to protect and preserve mangrove forests. The huge cover of mangroves in the region has been demolished and is occupied by the aqua farmers and locals, raising concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/official-preparedness-mitigates-cyclone-impact/articleshow/86920407.cms||Venu Lanka

With the catchment area of the river turning red owing to incessant rains on Thursday, the level had reached to 530 NTU. Water containing 1 milligram of finely divided silica per litre has a turbidity of 1 NTU. Up to 50 NTU is considered as a normal unit. This was the second time the plant has recorded high turbidity since June when the plants were submerged due to flooding in the area. On June 22, the turbidity level was 500 NTU. Stating that the phenomenon is common during the incessant rains, Nivruti Parsekar, executive engineer of water division said the soil gets washed off from the surrounding areas and finds its way into the Opa catchment area leading to rise in the turbidity. “Water is now free of turbidity. It is released to consumers only after proper filtration at the Opa water treatment plants. Water is channeled through three stages from sand filter beds to the chlorination plant and into the main balancing reservoir for storage and supply,” he said. Sometime consumers get reddish water due to the presence of fine particles that remain in it even after filtration. But it's not harmful, Parsekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/turbidity-level-at-opa-brought-under-control/articleshow/86922539.cms||---

The victims were admitted with 30-50% burns at a local hospital. Cops have registered an attempt-to-murder case against accused Sai Krishna (29), who also suffered burns and is admitted in a hospital. His condition was stable and would be arrested once discharged, cops said. Krishna, a real estate businessman from Karimnagar, had fallen in love with T Neethika (29), a software engineer and distant relative from KPHB Colony, and married her in 2016. Differences cropped up between the couple a year after marriage and Neethika moved to her parents’ flat in Sri Sai Brundhavan Apartment in phase VI of KPHB Colony. Based on her complaint, KPHB police registered a domestic harassment case which is now in court. “On Saturday night, Krishna barged into his in-law’s flat with a petrol bottle in hand. Neethika thought he was carrying acid in the bottle and locked herself in the bedroom,” KPHB inspector Laxminarayana said. The accused then doused her parents, T Sagar Rao (54), a farmer, and T Rama (50), a housewife, with petrol and set them ablaze. “While Sagar Rao suffered about 50% burns on his legs and back, Rama suffered about 30% burns on her legs and hands,” the inspector said. In the scuffle, the accused also suffered burns, but managed to flee. Neighbours who rushed hearing the screams took the couple to a nearby private hospital. Police said that Krishna, who returned to Karimnagar and got himself admitted at a private hospital, was out of danger and would be arrested once released from hospital. In the scuffle, Sai Krishna, the accused , also suffered burns, but his condition is stable. The victims were admitted with 30-50% burns at a local hospital.

To overcome the loss of passengers during Covid-19, the MSRTC had launched a service for citizens and businessmen to transport their goods, parcels or packages from one destination to another. This kind of service is proving to be a good source of income for MSRTC. “Till two days ago, two drivers were deputed on cargo buses. But now only one driver is being posted posing multiple risks. A lone driver faces difficulty in reversing the bus as there is no one to give direction. In case of breakdown we need assistant,” said a section of ST drivers. “Secondly, many times the godowns where goods have to be downloaded are in interior areas where the help of assistants is needed. When we stop to take a lunch or tea break there are chances of theft. Any road transport vehicle has an assistant for help,” said another driver. Nagpur divisional controller Nilesh Belsare confirmed a letter in this regard was issued by him on October 4, asking depot managers to allot one driver for cargo buses for a 200km distance and an assistant beyond that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-driver-rule-for-st-cargo-buses-opposed/articleshow/86922541.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad records 91mm rainfall, third wettest October day||HYDERABAD: The city experienced its third wettest day in October after it recorded 91mm of rainfall on the evening of October 9. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad predicts that the city is likely to witness a rather rainy Dasara following formation of a low pressure area (LPA) over north Andaman sea around October 14-15. As per the IMD, Hyderabad figures, the city recorded an all-time rainfall record for the month of October in 2020 after it was pounded with 191 mm of rains in a span of 24 hours. Prior to that, it was on October 10, 2013 that the city recorded 98.3 mm of rains in a day. This year, the city recorded 91 mm of rains on October 9, making it the third wettest day of the month. The city recorded heavy rains for two consecutive days following a confluence zone over Telangana, wherein humid and dry winds from different parts merge and trigger intense weather activities. Meteorologists predict that formation of yet another LPA over the north Andaman sea is likely to trigger a spell of moderate to heavy rains over Telangana. “While the rainfall activity may be on the lower side from October 11-13, it may again pick up its intensity on October 14-15 as there is a possibility that the LPA may subsequently turn into a cyclone. As the cyclone reaches south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast, it may trigger rains in Telangana,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency. Although the withdrawal of southwest monsoon has commenced from the western parts of the country, it is delayed by almost 19 days. Meteorologists predict that the withdrawal of southwest monsoon may only happen by the third week of October over Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-records-91mm-rainfall-third-wettest-october-day/articleshow/86920495.cms||---

The former chief minister recalled that domestic services from Kadapa airport were launched in 2018 during the TDP regime as the then government made good use of the Udan scheme under which flights were introduced between tier-2 and tier-3 cities. “Now, people have to travel to the airports in other districts or other states which is both time-consuming and a waste of money,” Naidu noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/resume-flight-services-from-kadapa-airport-naidu-urges-cm/articleshow/86920493.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Since Friday evening, the manholes in P&T colony and Kodhandaram Nagar near Saroornagar Lake have been spilling toxic froth across the road. The manholes are connected to the storm water drains that carry excess water from the lake to the Musi river. The manholes in P&T colony and Kodhandaram Nagar near Saroornagar Lake have been spilling toxic froth across the roadAnnoyed by this unpleasant situation in the area, the residents requested the authorities to fix the problem at the earliest. “This is not the first time that we are facing this problem. The manholes in the area spill this froth after every single spell of rain. This time the situation is much worse as the froth has also entered a few houses in the locality,” said Sri Vardhini, a resident of P&T colony, Saroornagar. The commuters passing through both these areas also fear that the froth may lead to accidents. “While I was at Kodhandaram Nagar, I saw a bike coming to a screeching halt in the middle of the road as froth that fell on the motorist’s helmet blinded his view. This could have led to a serious accident,” Kota Sai Kumar, a resident of Kodhandaram Nagar told TOI. When contacted, GHMC deputy commissioner of LB Nagar, H Krishnaiah said, “Our staff is present at the location and cleared the froth twice since morning. We are taking up measures to ensure that the locals don’t continue to suffer with this issue in future.” “To arrest the flooding in this area, we need to construct a drain pipeline under the Strategic Nala Development Programme of the GHMC. Plans are afoot for the project and once it concludes, water from upstream areas will follow its natural course to Musi without causing any floods,” said Krishnaiah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saroornagar-manholes-spew-toxic-froth/articleshow/86920491.cms||Moulika.KV

On Sunday, mud was seen piled up in the by-lanes of Seshachala Colony, SBH Colony, Ganesh Nagar, Viman Nagar and Marriramireddy Colony. In certain flooded areas, apartments, electric panels installed at the cellars were inundated with flood water, due to the nearby nalas overflowing. A major reason for this situation was the lack of drainage system and silt in the nalas. In fact, all these areas were inundated with about one to two-feet floodwater. “SCB officials are unprepared to handle heavy rainfall and waterlogging. Despite having experienced the flash floods in October 2020, no remedies have been implemented to prevent waterlogging,” Thota Ravindra, a resident of Seshachala Colony told TOI. An open nala passing through the residential colony overflowed due to sewerage water gushing from the upstream areas, he added. SCB senior superintendent (SWM) M Devender said all special teams attended to most complaints of waterlogging and have resolved the issue. “Instructions were given to lift garbage and sludge which piled up in the areas too,” he said.

District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said the parents and college students should aim to get vaccinated by October 14. Deshmukh said colleges have been told to collect vaccination certificates from students and their parents starting October 14. In the case school students, parents have been asked to submit their vaccination certificates. Stepping up efforts, the district administration has set a target of administering five lakh doses every day. The highest daily vaccination that the district has achieved so far is 2.54 lakh doses on August 31. To achieve this goal, the district collector said the support of trained staff at private vaccination centres can be taken. Deshmukh said that to vaccinate the eligible beneficiaries from remote areas in the district, the health department should micro-plan the drive. In rural areas with poor road connectivity, transportation should be made available for beneficiaries. The district collector has also asked authorities to increase the participation of women beneficiaries, for which assistance of women’s self-help groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) will be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-drives-for-college-students-from-tomorrow/articleshow/86922583.cms||Piyush Bhusari

With the latest addition, the combined capacity of these units has increased to around 40 metric tonnes in the district. The total target of the district administration is to increase this capacity to over 70 metric tonnes by installing a total of 65 such plants across civic hospitals. District health officials said that oxygen facilities in these three zones have been provided with corporate-social responsibility (CSR) funding. Notably, oxygen consumption had gone up drastically in the district earlier this year, during the peak of the second Covid-19 pandemic wave in April. Demand, which had surged up to 363 metric tonnes per day at the time, has now fallen to 120-130 metric tonnes per day. The health department is also strengthening its liquid oxygen storage capacity, which has now reached 339 metric tonnes. It further stated that there is capacity of around 256 metric tonnes for this purpose in 20 private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-3-oxygen-plants-within-a-week/articleshow/86922595.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Chennai||From Ambattur to America||CHENNAI: Spot an opportunity and go the whole hog. That has been U Venkatesh’s policy from his attempt at an automotive dealership to making connecting rods and thermostats for automobiles to manufacturing high-precision components and assemblies for aerospace and defence. Each of these ventures has become a new starting point for a high-flying enterprise. Moving back to India leaving a business analyst’s job at JP Morgan, U Venkatesh took to automotive dealerships, starting with Hyundai before adding more OEMs to his portfolio. “The critical component for success is recruiting the right people with the right attitude and integrity, imbibing the right processes from the start,” says Venkatesh. Today, KUN is responsible for sales and aftersales of brands including Rolls-Royce, BMW, MINI, Hyundai, KIA, Honda and Daimler trucks. A chance meeting he had with Magal Group-UK in 2008 resulted in the group getting into auto parts manufacturing. Investing capital and building a strong technical team gained the company a strategic foothold in the supply chain network across several Indian and international automakers. As a logical extension, KUN Aerospace was born in 2010 to produce high precision components and assemblies for aerospace, defence and medical applications. Then came `Make in India`. “We had all the fundamental infrastructure and processes in place. This sudden push for local sourcing gave us bigger opportunities. I travelled to the US several times, meeting many of our old customers and new clients, convincing them that we can produce high- precision components and assemblies to meet their stringent quality requirements. After many meetings, we started manufacturing these things at Ambattur, for leading international aerospace companies,” says Venkatesh. The big moment came when Pratt & Whitney was looking for someone to make the complex titanium engine bearing housing for GT Engines, the latest range of aircraft engines. The bearing – as big as a wet grinder – is so critical a part that it has never been made outside the US. KUN offered to do it. It demanded precision levels of 12-micron or oneeighth the thickness of a human hair. The part is as big as a wet grinder. The aircraft propellers, that are mounted on these housing run up to 18 hours non-stop and more than 15 years, for many million miles. KUN Aerospace CEO Srinivasa Rao remembers the tense days when the new customer ran multiple security drills and audits. “After many such exercises, we were selected as a tier-1 supplier. That was a good break. But the cherry was when we were granted Gate C status that allows KUN to supply the component directly to the assembly line of Pratt and Whitney in the US. Simply put, it was a stamp of trust,” says Rao. Having bagged orders for India’s defence projects, now KUN has set its eyes on high-precision medical components. “When the world starts flying all over again, the demand for planes will rise and that would be a great time for all of us. We are waiting in the wings,” says Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/from-ambattur-to-america/articleshow/86931100.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

However, the price cap has imposed restrictions on the process. To resolve this, we have made a fresh demand,” Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner of PMC, said. “The conversion to e-vehicles will also help reducing expenses on fossil fuel. This will ultimately help save public funds. The use of eco-friendly transport is a good message to give out to society,” he added.  Some corporators have said that PMC should buy these vehicles instead of taking them on rent. Estimates outline that of the total project cost, Rs 21.95 crore will be spent after the end of this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-wants-hike-in-price-cap-to-buy-e-vehicles/articleshow/86922618.cms||---

The road, which was blocked on Sunday afternoon, also connects with Chandigarh road. There was a traffic jam as the agitators blocked the road for about 15 minutes. Joint commissioner of police J Elanchezhian and ADCP-I Pragya Jain reached the spot and pacified the agitators but they still stationed themselves on the road for about one hour and staged a peaceful protest. On October 3, Rohit Sharma, district president of Shri Hindu Takht started a hunger strike demanding action while state president of the organisation, Varun Mehta announced that he would immolate himself if police failed to lodge an FIR. Police managed to pacify them at the time but no case was registered. “It has been over 20 days since we submitted a police complaint demanding action against the actors. Every time, police gave assurances but did not lodge an FIR. On Sunday afternoon, we staged a protest at Samrala Chowk, where senior police officials assured that they would register a case after the protest ended,” Varun Mehta said. He said if the police failed to lodge a case this time, they would stage a dharna outside Jassi Gill’s house in Khanna. He alleged that the recently released film, “Kya meri Sonam Gupta bewafa hai?’ some of the dialogues had hurt religious sentiments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/film-dialogues-spark-anger-protesters-block-road/articleshow/86918680.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Loss in Lok Sabha poll reflects waning power of JD(S) in Mandya, says Siddaramaiah||Mandya: Nikhil Kumaraswamy’s loss in the 2019 Lok Sabha election attested to the waning prowess of the JD(S) in Mandya district, said former chief minister Siddaramaiah here on Sunday. The former CM pointed out that the JD(S), which boasted six of the seven MLAs in the district, had suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of an Independent in the election. “The Congress did not field a candidate for the Mandya Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The JD(S), despite having six MLAs in the district, could not win the election. Had the JD(S) been really strong, it would not have lost the poll. The JD(S) is losing its grip in Mandya,” said Siddaramaiah. The leader of the opposition in the assembly said that he had not been reacting to statements made by former CM HD Kumaraswamy and former Prime Minister and JD(S) president HD Deve Gowda, whom he charged with deliberately misconstruing his statements. “They are misinterpreting my statements and trying to portray me in a bad light,” said Siddaramaiah, who said that he had been fighting the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which he dubbed a ‘communal’ outfit, throughout his political career. Former CM urges state govt to retain MySugar Mill ownership Congress leaders on Sunday extended their support to the farmers, who are on an indefinite strike against the state government, demanding that operations resume at the defunct MySugar Mill in Mandya. Siddaramaiah was among those who sat in the dharna in front of the statue of Sir M Visvesvaraya in Mandya. Urging the state government to retain ownership of the mill, the former CM said, “MySugar Mill is the only sugar factory in the state owned by the government, and should neither be sold or leased to a private company.” Pressing the government to revive the mill, Siddaramaiah said that it was unfair to blame the farmers for the prevailing state of affairs. “Instead of reviving public sector units, the BJP is trying to sell them to private entities. The government must find out why these units are incurring losses, and pull them out of the pit,” he added. Siddaramaiah assured the farmers that, when the Congress staked claim to power in the state, it would reopen MySugar Mill within a month. “It is advisable to drop the protest now since the state government has publicly announced that it will not privatise the mill. Should the government go back on its promise, I will join the farmers in their fight,” the former CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/loss-in-lok-sabha-poll-reflects-waning-power-of-jds-in-mandya-says-siddaramaiah/articleshow/86920640.cms||---

She found that that the person who made the transfer owned a truck impounded for illegal sand transportation, and he wanted her to settle the matter. The tehsildar immediately reported the matter to the Pune unit of the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) as the truck owner’s act constituted an attempt to give bribe, which is an offence under the privisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. ACB officials, however, point out that cases of attempt to give bribes account for a minuscule portion of the overall bribery cases registered with them. In fact, only eight such complaints have reached them in the last five years as against the 839 cases registered for demand and acceptance of bribes by public servants. Such cases, in which bribes are offered forcibly, are known as ‘reverse trap cases’. ACB Pune has jurisdiction over Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur districts. Deputy superintendent of police Shrihari Patil said, “Many factors can be attributed to the fact that few government officials approach ACB if someone is offering them a bribe.” He said the reluctance to report bribe offers can be because bribe-seekers outnumber those resisting bribes. “Secondly, such attempts get reported only in situations where getting work done is not possible and a public servant is under pressure to accept a bribe,” he said. A senior ACB officer told TOI, “There are some upright officers who do not like people approaching with an ‘offer’. They either directly throw out such people from their office or approach the ACB.” Out of these eight cases, Patil said, four forced bribe cases were registered in Kolhapur, one each in Solapur and Sangli and two in Pune. Advocate Pratap Pardeshi said, “These are rare cases when a government servant lodges a complaint with the ACB stating that someone from the public was offering a bribe to him/her. In such cases, people generally offer cash to the public servant, or gold ornaments kept in the files even though the government officers did not demand anything from them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-5-years-acb-pune-records-8-bribe-offers-839-graft-cases/articleshow/86922694.cms||---

Nearly 47% of children and parents surveyed admitted that school buses or vans don’t have seatbelts; in the case of private transport it is as high as 72%. Moreover, 20% of the respondents — children and parents — who use self or family driven cars to schools admitted that they don’t wear seatbelts and nearly 34% of the respondents claimed that they never wear a helmet while riding a two-wheeler to school. The study, carried out across 14 major cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Jaipur and Ahmedabad with a sample size of 11,845, also found that nearly 30% of children admitted that they have witnessed a road crash during their travel to school while 6% of them were involved in such accidents. According to the ‘Safe Commute to School’ study by SaveLife Foundation and the R&D wing of Mercedes-Benz, school buses are the most preferred mode of transport. Nearly one-third of the children among respondents said they travel by school bus, followed by school van (12%) and another 11% of children commute to school by walking. The study covered different aspects of commuting to school by transport provided by the schools, privately arranged by parents, using own or family driven vehicles, and safety around the educational institutions. The report said based on the responses of parents, 20% of those using school affiliated transport said their child mostly or sometimes complains about rash driving, overtaking and jumping of red lights at traffic signals. Around 22% of parents claimed that their children don’t wait for the vehicle to come fully to a stop before boarding or deboarding. As per the report, over 70% of respondents reported the presence of fire extinguishers in school buses and over 75% of them reported the presence of a first aid kit. However, less than half of the respondents claimed that their vehicles had emergency contact numbers listed. The study found that 39% of respondents reported that vehicles were fitted with safety tools like first-aid box, fire extinguishers etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-just-transporters-parents-too-flout-norms-during-school-commute/articleshow/86925924.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Delhi||Learning with Khaki: Jamia police station library takes digital avatar||NEW DELHI: If a student is looking for a quiet place for a few hours of peaceful studying, what would be the right place to head to? For a student living in south Delhi’s Jamia Nagar, the answer would be the nearest police station. Started in 2012, the “Police Public Library” at Jamia Nagar police station is arguably the country’s first that arms visitors with books. Set up to remove a common citizen’s fear of a police station, this unique initiative of Delhi Police is being successfully managed by an NGO, Shikhar Organisation for Social Development.The library was recently revamped into “Delhi Police Digital Library” with financial support from power discom BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL). The cost of running the digital library, including that of educational material, maintenance and salaries, is being borne by BRPL through its CSR programmes. Mehjabeen Shabnam, a teacher, couldn’t believe her ears when she first heard about the library. “At first, my parents didn’t agree and even I had some hesitation about going to study among policemen,” said the 20-something Jamia Nagar resident. “However, when I visited the library, the atmosphere there was safe and more girls came there,” she added. Devesh Chandra Srivastava, special commissioner, who was the joint commissioner of police (southern range), when this initiative was mooted, said Delhi Police was a pioneer when it came to such community initiatives. “One of the things we did to bring the student community closer to us was starting this library at Jamia Nagar. Then we got another at RK Puram and a third one at Okhla Vihar Metro police station,” said Srivastava, adding that such initiatives smoothen the relation between police and public. Srivastava added, “BSES is sponsoring us in the smooth running of this library. The discom has also supported Delhi Police Public Schools by setting up smart classrooms.” “‘Our CSR programmes maintain a symbiotic relationship with the society as we live and work in perfect harmony with the communities around us. We look for unique opportunities and work with like-minded partners to bring about positive changes in the society,” BSES said in a statement. The senior IPS officer said, “We also run coaching classes in association with educators and provide books and journals.” He added that apart from senior IPS officers like himself, other senior civil servants were also called to teach students, including an IRS officer who provides regular coaching. “The library provides facilities like study materials, Wi-Fi, laptops, etc for free,” said UPSC aspirant Ketan Singh, who loves the library’s “professional environment”. Nadeem Akhtar, director of the library, said the idea was to provide coaching facilities to students who might not be able to afford it otherwise. “Initially, it was difficult to encourage parents from the nearby locality to send their children here. However, over time many girls and boys started coming here after finding out for themselves how safe the environment was,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/learning-with-khaki-jamia-police-station-library-takes-digital-avatar/articleshow/86920694.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Remembering the Father of Indian animation & tracing the industry’s rise||October 11 marks the death anniversary of the only animator to be awarded the Padma Shri, the man known with affection as the ‘Father of Indian animation’- Ram Mohan. To the world of culture at large, he remains largely unknown. To sum up a six-decade long career in a piece isn’t easy, but here’s the story in brief. Ram Mohan came to Bombay in the 50s, a science grad with his heart in cartooning. He had picked up the rudiments on his own, and with a wry sense of humour made cartoons that got published in Illustrated Weekly of India. When the government, with help from the Americans, set up the Cartoon Film Unit at Films Division (FD) in Bombay, he went to meet the man in charge of running it —Claire Weeks—a Disney veteran who’d worked on Snow White, Bambi and Peter Pan. Weeks hired him. While their first film was narrative—a retelling of the Jataka tale of ‘The Banyan Deer’—the unit essentially worked on spreading ideas. The themes were public service messages about everything from the metric system to sanitation and family planning. Those cartoon films may have done more to promote Unity in Diversity among generations of Indians than most politicians’ speeches. Just recall Ek Anek (dir: Bhimsain) or The Tree of Unity (dir: V.G. Samant) on Doordarshan, a golden nostalgic moment presenting to us our innate goodness and Indianness. Ram Mohan was in the first generation of The Cartoon Film Unit and mentored many coming after him in scripting, designing, and direction. He left FD in 1968 and, after a stint at Prasad Labs, set up Ram Mohan Biographics (RMB) with tech wiz S.G. Naik Satam and background designer ‘Bapu’ Parulekar in 1971. They worked on animated titles for feature films (B.R. Chopra’s Pati Patni aur Woh, Sai Paranjpye’s Chashme Buddoor and Katha, Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj ke Khiladi, Mrinal Sen’s Bhuvan Shome, ‘Do Aur Do Paanch, Biwi-o-Biwi) and short films, ‘You Said it (1971), Down To Earth (1971-74)’ Taru (1989) for CFSI, ‘The White Elephant’ (1994) for UNESCO. Ad film pioneers collaborated with them to create effects. RMB studio was an ‘adda’ of upcoming talents like Govind Nihalani, Prahlad Kakkar, Rani Burra Dey. Ram Mohan also co-directed the Indo-Japanese collaboration, Ramayana, with the passionate Hugo Sako. That film has celebrated 25 years and was re-released theatrically in Japan. It didn't bring its makers many rewards due to political concerns over Lord Ram being turned into a cartoon. It finally got an audience on TV and home video. In the opinion of many, it is still the best adaptation of Valmiki’s epic. Ram Mohan's greatest contribution, however, is a simple and innocent creation — a village girl named Meena who spread awareness in rural Southeast Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh), championing gender equality, girl child literacy, even cleanliness and sanitation. Created by UNICEF, the episodes of this little girl and her family remain in circulation. So successful was Meena that UNICEF called him in to create a similar character (Sara) for the African continent. Despite debilitating illness, he made one last film for FD at age 84. This was ‘The Pea Plant Legacy’ (2015), a tribute to the founder of Indian cinema, Dadasaheb Phalke, recreating his early experiments. Remarkable in conceptualisation, it showcases 2D-3D, Stop Motion, and timelapse photography in both color and black and white. This was four years before his death. Ram Mohan was bestowed the V.Shantaram Lifetime Achievement Award (2002) and Padmashri (2014). That said, his main legacy is still his role as mentor for scores of artists who worked under him or were inspired by him. This is what makes him the ‘Father of Indian animation.’ (The writer is a National award-winning animator who began his career at Ram Mohan's studio)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-remembering-the-father-of-indian-animation-tracing-the-industrys-rise/articleshow/86924501.cms||Chetan Sharma

The meeting will be held offline after a long time. The previous two meetings were held virtually and now, officials and board members want chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is also the chairman of the board, to spend some more time at the crucial meeting. As reported by TOI, the meeting will take a call on translocation of tigers recommended by an 11-member expert committee. It will also discuss the measures to be taken to quell leopard-human conflict. SBWL is also likely to approve the first exclusive state wildlife action plan, prepared by a team of wildlife experts and senior officials. Apart from several projects for diversion of forest land in wildlife sanctuaries and eco-sensitive zones of tiger reserves, the meeting is set to finalize the expansion of Tadoba by including the extended area in the core area of TATR. A controversial proposal to give wildlife clearance to the reserve forest area of 467.45 hectares to a cement plant falling in tiger corridor in three compartments of Hirapur, Govindpur and Pimparwadi in Zari-Zamni taluka in Pandharkawda division, is also on the agenda. The said area connects Tadoba tiger reserve and Kanhargaon and Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuaries. The meeting will also discuss the creation of additional posts of rapid strike force (RSF) units in the forest department. A proposal to rectify 2% amount of the project cost of Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed railway is also on the cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-key-issues-to-figure-in-state-wildlife-board-meeting-on-tuesday/articleshow/86922791.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||Breaking the glass ceiling, women SHOs in Delhi raring to go||NEW DELHI: In the recent reshuffle of police officers, eight women inspectors have been posted as station house officers, boosting the number of women in the post from just one at the moment to nine. For most of the women inspectors, their new order came as a “surprise shock” of the pleasant type. Inspector Poonam Pareek, 55, will take over as SHO at Vivek Vihar. The 1994 batch officer said, “I received so many calls last night. My colleagues sent me congratulatory messages on WhatsApp too. I hadn’t seen the order, so I was quite surprised. If we look at the overall picture, women officers are being given importance in terms of prime postings, which is a motivational shift.” The transfers of SHOs is part of a record reshuffle in which around 79 inspectors, 65 of them first timers, have been redeployed in 40 days. The aim is to inject a fresh outlook and energy into police station management and functioning. The sole woman SHO till now was Shivani Malik at Hauz Khas. For the women officers, this is an opportunity to serve the force and Delhi’s people. Inspector Kamini Gupta, 58, posted now at Badarpur, said, “The welfare of my co-workers, understanding their problems and crime control will be my prime focus areas.” Gupta also wants to address the issues around policemen taking their own lives. “Police personnel of all ranks have a hectic job and it’s important as an SHO for me to be aware of their needs and help ensure a healthy work-life balance,” she said. Leading a team isn’t new for Pareek. “I was in charge even when posted at the police control room,” she said. “When our male counterparts saw we worked without bias for women or men, they appreciated it,” she said. Inspector Pratibha Sharma, 53, now to take charge as SHO Vikaspuri, was part of the team investigating the Nirbhaya gang-rape case. And though she will have to travel 40km from her Faridabad home to the Vikaspuri police station, she is buoyed by the pride of her husband, an Indian Air Force pilot, and two children. “When I received the posting order, my son told me that I had the opportunity now of inspiring others just as I had inspired them since they were kids. When you have a family backing you, what more do you want?” Sharma said. Alpna Sharma, 54, hopes to nip crimes in the bud as SHO of RK Puram police station, while Harijinder Kaur, 55, who will be in charge at Daryaganj, wants to “prove herself” in her new role. The other three newly named SHOs are Dominka Purty (Delhi Cantonment), Roshlin Punam Minz (Nehru Place Metro) and Sapna Duggal (Defence Colony). The eight inspectors will, no doubt, have new priorities. As Pareek, who is an animal lover and has dogs, birds and cows at home to look after, said, “Being an SHO requires you to focus on your police area and even be accessible round the clock, so I will have to make arrangements for the animals at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/breaking-the-glass-ceiling-women-shos-raring-to-go/articleshow/86920730.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Delhi||A hive of activity... 8-year survey identifies 338 moth species in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A study on insect diversity has identified 338 moth species from 32 families spanning 14 superfamilies in the capital. Of these, around 200 moth species were added to the biodiversity not reported earlier. The survey was done for eight years using light trapping data and examining about 2,000 specimens from historical collections at National Pusa Collection of ICAR, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which is one of the largest insect repositories in Asia for agricultural pests since the 1900s. For the study, which was recently published in Biodiversity Data Journal, field surveys were conducted from 2012 to 2020 by setting up light traps at IARI, Rashtrapati Bhavan and Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. The light traps were set after sunset generally for five hours (6pm to 11pm) using a mercury vapour bulb of 160W. According to experts, moths are an important part of the food chain as they are the primary food source for vertebrate insectivores, including birds, bats and lizards. They are an important nocturnal pollinators of diverse agroecosystems. Sohail Madan of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), one of the researchers, said, “Moths play a specific role as they are the food base of many birds and bats. As we have made a checklist of moths found in Delhi, the data can be helpful for their conservation. Many more species can be identified and added to the list.” Among the major sightings were Silver-striped Hawkmoth, a nocturnal moth, and Coffee Bee Hawkmoth, a diurnal hawkmoth, found in green spaces. Asota moths use a variety of Ficus species as larval host plants and are important bioindicators. The adult moth, known as Lesser death’s head hawkmoth or bee robber, steals honey from hives. “These moths can mimic the scent of bees to enter a hive unharmed to get honey,” said PR Shashank, scientist, division of entomology, IARI, one of the researchers. The other researchers were J Komal, Sanjay Sondhi, Yash Sondhi, Naresh M Meshram and SS Anooj. Explaining how light pollution could impact moths, Shashank said, “Moths are nocturnal and strongly attracted to artificial light (phototaxis). Light pollution has a major impact on moths as they show positive phototaxis towards artificial light at night affecting various aspects, such as behaviour, physiology, dispersal activity and reproduction.” “Artificial light acts as a feeding suppressant by withdrawing the larvae from host plants towards the light source, causing decreased larval development. There is no systematic study on the effect of light pollution on insects in India, but we are planning to work on it in future,” added Shashank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-hive-of-activity-8-year-survey-identifies-338-moth-species-in-city/articleshow/86920754.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Renting a car a costly affair this festive season||KOLKATA: Most private car rental service agencies in the city have hiked rates following steady ascent in petrol and diesel prices in the city which rose again on Sunday – the 11th such increase in 13 days. The result – revellers booking cars for pandal trips and short and long drives are being forced to shell out way extra than other years and some even opting out to book a car and taking up the rather risky affair of travelling in a crowded public transport amidst the pandemic and looming third wave of Covid pandemic. Till last year, a regular sedan was available on a rent at Rs 130 to Rs 140 per hour for minimum 10 hours or Rs 13/ 14 per kilometre for minimum 100 kilometres. When petrol touched the century mark in July this year, most agencies had increased the fares to Rs 150 to Rs 160 for the same duration and per km rate for a sedan was around Rs 15/Rs 16. This time, the same car is being rented out at anything between Rs 18 – Rs 20 per km or Rs 180 – Rs 200 per hour. “The pandemic has already robbed us of customers and I had to sell three cars to survive during the lockdown. But the rising fuel prices have hurt us even more. I have no option but to increase the rent price or else, we were practically left with nothing after paying for fuel and including a day’s salary for the driver,” said Pronab Mohanti, who runs a car rental firm in New Town. Fuel prices in the country have been hovering at record levels on account of 41 increases in its retail rates since April this year. In Kolkata, petrol price had hit the century run across all petrol pumps on July 7 as it clocked Rs 100.29 per litre. It had a steady run for the next 11 days to reach Rs 102.14 and the price remained till August 21 following which the price started dropping and it came down to Rs 101.64 on September 7. The price remained constant at this mark for the for the next 20 days after which the rise started again and it has now chugged past Rs 104 and reached an all-time new high of Rs 104.80 on Sunday. “During pujas, we usually increase the rates a bit as we have to pay the drivers more and take extra load of passengers. This time, the situation is such that even we are feeling bad for charging so much from a passenger. But we have no options.  I have even let go of two drivers and my brother and I are driving two of our cars by ourselves to make some savings and charge Rs 10 less per km from the passengers,” said Bapi Ghosh, who runs a car rental service in Behala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tamaghna-car-rental/articleshow/86920748.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Bengaluru||Karntaka: No end in sight to row over state anthem tune||BENGALURU: An official committee has recommended to the state government that the state anthem — Kuvempu’s poem Jaya Bharatiya Jananiya Tanujate — should be sung to the tune composed by the late Bhavageethe legend Mysuru Ananthaswamy. But the recommendation has ruffled a few feathers. Critics, who want another light-music singer C Ashwath’s tune to be adopted, claim that Ananthaswamy had sung only two stanzas of the poem and adopting his tune for the entire poem wouldn’t be fair. Joint director of Kannada and culture department Balwant Rao Patil said: “The committee headed by H R Leelavathi has recommended Ananthaswamy’s tune .” Chairman of Karnataka Sugama Sangeetha Parishat Y Muddukrishna told TOI: “It is important for the government to decide if they want to consider the full text of Kuvempu’s poem or not. When I was the director of Kannada and culture department in 2004, the government had ordered to keep only two stanzas of the poem. But faced with protests by pro-Kannada forums, it later retained the entire poem.” “If the government wants to limit the anthem to two stanzas, they have to adopt the tune of Ananthaswamy. If it keeps the full poem, then they have to adopt Ashwath’s tune. The government should discuss the issue with music composers and not restrict the selection to only two tunes,” he added. Singer and president of Adarsha Sugama Sangeeta Academy Kikkeri Krishnamurthy said while Ashwath’s tune is easy to sing, Ananthaswamy’s tune won’t be that easy. According to Muddukrishna, Ashwath had composed tune to the whole song and sung it and there is a video evidence for the same. Even music director Vijay Bhaskar had composed music for the whole poem and it was rendered by singer P B Srinivas in a Kannada movie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-end-in-sight-to-rowover-state-anthem-tune/articleshow/86920751.cms||---

Two younger children of the couple escaped with injuries. The state government has promised to assist the victims’ family by providing ex gratia. At 6.30am, neighbours of P Mosha, 40, a farm hand, and his wife Shantamma, 35, from Kothapally village in Aiza mandal of Jogulamba Gadwal district noticed that something was wrong as the panchayat water tap in the house was left open for a long time. When the neighbours entered the hut, they saw that the cement brick partition wall in the house had collapsed on the seven members of the family. “The two younger children who suffered injuries were rushed to the nearest hospital for treatment. Their condition is out of danger,” Aiza sub-inspector (SI) G Muthaiah said. The deceased were identified as Mosha, his wife Shantamma and their three children — Charan,11, Teja, 9, and Ramu, 7. The injured children are five-year-old Sneha and four-year-old Chinna. Police said the victim’s house, with a thatched roof, had mud and stone walls. Mosha had constructed a mortar brick partition wall in the middle of the house. “Though it rained heavily here, water seepage was not visible inside the house. Though the house was old, the side walls are strong. The partition wall’s base was not built properly and it suddenly collapsed on the family members who were in deep sleep,” Shantinagar circle inspector (CI) Venkateshwarlu said. Police registered a suspicious death case under Section 174 of the CrPC and shifted the bodies for post-mortem examination on Sunday morning. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was informed about the tragic incident by minister S Nirajnjan Reddy. Gadwal collector Valluri Kranthi visited the village and, after speaking to the relatives, announced that the government would support the family by providing ex gratia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-of-family-die-in-wall-collapse-in-gadwal-dist/articleshow/86924502.cms||---

---||Delhi||HC issues draft rules to fast-track IPR issues||New Delhi: In a bid to fast-track commercial disputes, Delhi High Court has come out with a set of draft rules that say summary adjudication can be resorted to in certain matters pertaining to intellectual property rights. Prepared by an in-house committee of two judges, the draft rules submitted to the chief justice on October 8 have also been circulated for comments from the Bar. The committee of justices Prathiba M Singh and Sanjeev Narula has also suggested that summary adjudication can be done by the high court’s intellectual property division (IPD) without requiring a specific application. The court had created the IPD to deal with all matters related to intellectual property rights (IPR) after the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, led to the abolition of various boards and appellate tribunals that existed under different laws governing IPR. “The committee consisting of Justice Prathiba M Singh and Justice Sanjeev Narula submitted the draft Delhi High Court Intellectual Property Rights Division Rules, 2021, to the Hon’ble Chief Justice. On October 8, 2021, the rules were circulated for seeking comments of the Bar,” a statement issued by the high court said. The draft Delhi High Court Intellectual Property Rights Division Rules, 2021, further proposes maintaining a “panel of experts” and law researchers to assist the court in IPR cases. The inclusion of modern methods for recording of evidence, common trial and consolidated adjudication in certain cases has also been suggested. In a statement issued in July, the high court authorities had informed that the decision to create the IPD was based on the recommendations of the committee, which was created by Delhi High Court Chief Justice D N Patel. It said that the chief justice would notify IPD benches from time to time and exclusive IPD benches are also likely to be created for dealing with such matters. According to information received from the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), around 3,000 cases are now to be transferred to the Delhi High Court to abolish various boards and appellate tribunals for IPR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-issues-draft-rules-to-fast-track-ipr-issues/articleshow/86920794.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pujas record crowds like Saptami-Ashtami as revellers make most of dry Panchami||KOLKATA: An extended pre-Puja weekend and a dry Sunday brought thousands of revellers out on a pandal-hopping spree on Panchami. The surge had begun from Chaturthi, a Saturday, and as the rain eased off, revellers thronged the city streets from early on Sunday morning. As the day progressed, the crowd continued to grow. While Sreebhumi drew a record crowd, other big-ticket pujas in Lake Town, Bangur Avenue and Dum Dum Park, too, attracted thousands making crowd management a challenge for the police. VIP Road was swarmed by revellers in the evening, slowing down traffic movement for several hours. Revellers at HaridevpurCops said they tried their best to force people to use subways to cross road and even allowed both-way traffic movement along the Kolkata-bound flank of VIP Road. But plans didn’t seem to work even as a surge of revellers erupted on the VIP Road, ignoring all Covid protocols with cops cautioning people on loudspeakers urging them to maintain social distance. Revellers heading to the most talked about puja in this part of the city — Sreebhumi Sporting where the pandal is shaped like Dubai’s Burj Khalifa — took anything between one and half to two hours to cover the 500-metre stretch to reach the pandal from VIP Road. Standing near the entrance of Mudiali Club, secretary Ashok Dey kept a check on the continuous increase in crowd flow from early afternoon. “It seems like Saptami or Ashtami. Since Saturday, we have received more than double the number of visitors we had during this time last year. I wonder what will happen in the next few days,” said Dey, adding that they have hired double the number of security guards — 14 — compared to last year. Revellers at Suruchi SanghaTo make the most of the extended weekend, revellers started early on Sunday. “I was worried about the rain forecast, but as it stopped drizzling from Saturday afternoon, I set out with my family. We have visited almost all the major pandals in south and central Kolkata,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, a resident of Beliaghata. There were other revellers who were in a hurry to wrap up their pandal-hopping to ensure they have enough time during the main Puja days to stay in their neighbourhoods. “I am going out and will spend the Puja at Purulia on Monday. I wanted to visit a few pandals before leaving the city,” said Anjan Chatterjee, a resident of Behala. Raktima Hazra, a resident of Bonhooghly stated that she had travelled all the way to Kidderpore to catch a glimpse of 25 Pally before heading to Behala. Kolkata Police that used a 8,000-strong force on Panchami ensured that traffic continued to flow. Till Chaturthi, the south Kolkata pujas and Hatibagan-based pujas in the north were drawing the crowd. On Panchami, two big crowd pullers were Chetla Agrani and Suruchi Sangha. Similarly, Mudiali-Shibmandir and Tridhara drew a significant crowd. In north, Kumartuli Park-Ahiritola and Chaltabagan drew large crowds. The Bidhannagar Police, meanwhile, is focusing on Sreebhumi that has left VIP Road, the main link to the city airport, choked yet again. Though the situation improved compared to Saturday, the cops had to take to Twitter to ask airport-bound passengers to avoid VIP Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pujas-record-crowds-like-saptami-ashtami-as-revellers-make-most-of-dry-panchami/articleshow/86920790.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Gandhigiri: Sanjay Raut sees Indira Gandhi in Priyanka Gandhi||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday likened Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi to her grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi. In his column ‘Rok Thok’ in the party mouthpiece Saamna, Raut claimed that Priyanka exposed an attempted cover-up of the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in UP and shades of Indira Gandhi could be seen in her actions. Raut said that Priyanka’s spirited action in Lakhimpur Kheri had galvanised the entire Congress. Raut’s column, titled ‘Priyanka Gandhi’s fight on a dark night’, said that a minister’s son crushed four farmers in Uttar Pradesh but he was still free. “Central agencies like ED and CBI are arresting anyone these days. But the biggest party in the world is silent after digesting four deaths in this country. Priyanka Gandhi has woken them up from their slumber. We could see glimpses of Indira Gandhi once again through her,” Raut said. Raut said that even Priyanka’s detractors had to sit up, and they took notice of the support she garnered in Sitapur. “Images of her cleaning the floor of the rest house with a broom in her hand overshadowed the photo op by some netas,” Raut said. By photo op, Raut probably meant Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s programme to commemorate the 75th year of Independence in Lucknow along with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath last week. Raut also said that Priyanka’s brother Rahul Gandhi was the only leader who could provide an alternative to the current ruling dispensation in New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gandhigiri-raut-sees-indira-in-priyanka-in-mumbai/articleshow/86924504.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

In numbers, 4.14 crore out of 5.14 crore beneficiaries have received the first dose leaving around 1 crore peoplde whi are yet to receive evena single shot. Report on Covid vaccination showed that over 2.25 lakh doses were administered till 7pm on Sunday taking the cumulative doses to over 5.8 crore. Out of those, 4.14 crore received first dose while second dose was administered to 1.74 crore. The health department is increasingly holding camps across the state to ensure that the beneficiaries get vaccine doses easily in nearest possible places. As many as 6,087 government sites remained functional while only 44 private sites for vaccination remained functional.

Advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, member of the governing body, said the objective of the society is to provide paid legal aid at a nominal fee to the litigants in Delhi High Court, within the income group of Rs 7.5 lakh per annum. Chief Justice D N Patel inaugurated the office of High Court of Delhi (middle income group) Legal Aid Society last month. The governing body of the society comprises 12 members, including patron-in-chief, Justice Patel and president, Justice Vipin Sanghi. To avail the services of the society, a litigant will have to pay a fixed fee — from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 — for the entire matter.

---||Bareilly||Attempts being made to give Lakhimpur violence ‘Hindu vs Sikh’ colour: Varun Gandhi||LAKHIMPUR KHERI: BJP Lok Sabha member Varun Gandhi on Sunday said an attempt was being made to turn the Lakhimpur Kheri incident into a ‘Hindu versus Sikh’ battle and warned against “creating these fault lines and reopening wounds that have taken a generation to heal”. In a Twitter post on Sunday, which was retweeted over 5,000 times within a few hours, the Pilibhit MP said, “An attempt to turn Lakhimpur Kheri into a Hindu vs Sikh battle is being made. Not only is this an immoral and false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault lines and reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity.” Gandhi, who was dropped from the party's national executive just days ago, told TOI later that the issue has no religious connotations and the actual struggle for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri is about the “cruel massacre of poor farmers in the face of an arrogant local power elite.” He said: “To use the word ‘Khalistani’ liberally to describe the protesting farmers is not only an insult to the generations of these proud sons of Terai that have fought and shed blood on our borders, it is also extremely dangerous for our national unity if this provokes the wrong kind of reaction,” he said. Gandhi has in recent weeks often tweeted his support to the farmers’ protests against the three central farm laws. On October 5, he shared a video of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and demanded the arrest of the owners of vehicles that allegedly mowed down protesting farmers and a journalist. A day later, he and his mother, former union minister Maneka Gandhi, were dropped from the BJP's national executive committee. Earlier, Gandhi had also written letters to UP CM Yogi Adityanath outlining several measures that could “help farmers improve their revenues and resolve their issues", including increasing sugarcane prices, doubling the amount of the PM Kisan scheme and bonus on wheat and paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/attempts-being-made-to-give-lakhimpur-violence-hindu-vs-sikh-colour-varun/articleshow/86918935.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Jaipur||Govt wants more private hospitals in Rajasthan to join Chiranjeevi scheme||JAIPUR: For making Chiranjeevi insurance scheme a hit, private hospitals will play an important role. But a lot of private hospitals are yet to start providing the treatment under the scheme. The health department is now calling meetings of private hospitals to encourage them to get empanelled under the scheme. “I have spoken to the private hospitals, our principal secretary Akhil Arora, secretary health Vaibhav Galriya and chief secretary too had conducted meetings with the private hospitals. We have started the scheme from May 1. Whenever you start a scheme, you face some initial problems. But, I am hopeful that every big hospital in the state will provide treatment under the scheme,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. With a vision to provide free health services to each person, Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana was started in the state from May 1. Each family is being provided health insurance up to Rs 5 lakh through this Universal Health Scheme. The insurance scheme is a major step towards achieving Nirogi Rajasthan (Healthy Rajasthan) objectives. Apart from the empanelling private and government hosptials, the health department is taking measures to make people aware about the scheme and get registered for taking its benefits through Jan Aadhaar card. Sharma has directed its officials to conduct a survey to increase awareness to link the beneficiaries deprived of getting registered in Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana to the scheme. The door-to-door survey for identifying the beneficiaries deprived of Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana has also been started in the state. Such beneficiaries, who have Jan Aadhaar card but are not linked with Chiranjeevi scheme, their data will be provided by the department in soft copy. Officials said that registration process should be done through the nearest e-mitra centre or at the camp site on the camp day. The health minister said that such families who are not linked with Jan Aadhaar should be identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-ensuring-more-hospitals-to-treat-people-under-chiranjeevi/articleshow/86922880.cms||---

It may lead to showers in Kolkata and south Bengal from October 13-15 (Ashtami-Dashami). Kolkata could receive a heavy, consistent spell of rain one of these days. The low-pressure system is set to travel in a northwest direction towards Odisha and Andhra coasts. It may gain strength as it draws moisture and approaches the coast. The Regional Meteorological Centre has predicted that it could have a landfall on October 14. The city may come under the ‘outer band’ of the system. There will be a strong south-easterly wind during the period that may lead to rain. Weathermen expect the rain to begin late on October 13 (Ashtami) and remain light to moderate the next day. “It could turn heavier on Dashami, with possibility of Kolkata receiving a heavy spell on one of these two days,” said RMC director GK Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-spies-rain-from-wed-to-fri/articleshow/86920832.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Go to NGT, says Bombay HC to NGO challenging CRZ 2019||MUMBAI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is better equipped to deal with all points of law and facts in environmental matters, said the Bombay high court while declining to hear a challenge to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, 2019. “The Tribunal’s jurisdiction to deal with environmental issues is so wide and expansive that literally speaking, ‘everything under the sun’ raising substantial questions relating to the environment can be dealt with by it,’’ said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Makarand Karnik. The HC on Friday dismissed a PIL by Vanashakti. The NGO had challenged the January 18, 2019 CRZ notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, saying some of its provisions are manifestly arbitrary and violate the right to live in a healthy environment. The grounds included that CRZ 2019 increases floor space index (FSI) near coasts, reduces no development zones and CRZ near creeks and bays, and dilutes protection to mangroves and koliwadas. The NGO urged HC to declare CRZ 2019 illegal and ultra vires Article 14 (Right to Equality) and 21 (Right to Life), and instead declare CRZ 2011 valid and binding. On Thursday, the judges said the NGO must approach the NGT. Senior advocate Venkatesh Dhond, for Vanashakti, argued that NGT cannot hear a challenge to the constitutional vires of a legislation or subordinate legislation. Observing that the NGO “is labouring under a misconception” that CRZ 2019 is a law brought into force by the Central government, the judges said it is a statutory order made by it. They rejected the NGO’s contention that challenge to CRZ 2019 is not a civil dispute. The judges said NGT is vested with powers of civil courts. The Supreme Court has held that in the context of NGT Act, 2010, a ‘dispute’ would be an assertion of a right or interest or a claim met by a contrary claim. The judges said the NGO’s case before NGT would partake the character of a dispute if the respondents contest it. They also junked the NGO’s claim that the tribunal is incapable of deciding the issue of changes made by CRZ 2019 that would modify Development Control Regulations under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act,1966. The judges said the NGT Act, as a Central legislation will override state legislation and any planning law has to yield to it. Noting that the Coastal Zone Management Plan has been finalised, they granted Vanashakti liberty to move NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/go-to-ngt-says-high-court-to-ngo-challenging-crz-2019/articleshow/86924520.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Red Road bike goons threaten hockey coach ‘at gunpoint’||KOLKATA: A 42-year-old hockey coach, who after completing training in Maidan was walking along Red Road to take a bus to his Beniapukur home on Sunday evening, told police that he was accosted by two bike-borne miscreants who threatened him. Though the coach first alleged that they even fired two rounds, he later said that no firing took place and that he was only threatened at gunpoint. Police are trying to trace the goons. The incident had no witnesses and police are conducting their probe based on the complaint lodged. According to police, around 6pm, Md Sajid told the cops that he was headed home after a training session when the incident took place. The Maidan police are examining CCTV footage to track down the vehicle. Police said it was not immediately clear what was the motive of the two assailants. The incident reportedly took place less than 100 metres from a traffic outpost on Red Road. “The reports are still very preliminary, and we are still ascertaining the exact sequence of events. According to the complaint, the incident probably took place in front of a basketball training facility. Two bike-borne men came there and accosted him. They stated that they too wanted to learn the game and needed to talk to the coach. Then they fired in air and left. Later, however, he said that he was threatened at gunpoint. No one suffered any injury. Investigation is on,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The basketball training facility being referred by police is the West Bengal Basketball Association grounds. While this ground is used by players for training, according to rules, all clubs and tents in Maidan are shut from October 1 to October 15. A senior official said, “We have spoken to two malis (gardeners) who were present around 6pm. They didn’t hear or see anything.” Kolkata has reported four shootings in little over a month. This, however, is the first instance when none has been injured. Till now, police have arrested 13 persons involved in the four incidents. At least three others, including Sona Pappu who operates from Kasba, and Md Tariq from Bright Street, have been arrested during the same period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/red-rd-bike-goons-threaten-hockey-coach-at-gunpoint/articleshow/86920887.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Others who are still on the campus said they are scared and have not stepped out of their rooms. Read AlsoGurugram: 24-year-old shot dead by fellow student on university campusA 24-year-old student of SGT University was on Friday afternoon shot dead by another student on the campus.On Friday, Vinit, a final-year student of BAMS (bachelor of ayurvedic medicine and surgery), was shot dead by a fellow student. The youth was from Shamli in Uttar Pradesh and used to stay in the college hostel. Lovepreet Singh, a final-year BAMS student, said their parents are worried and have been asking them to leave the campus. “Everyone is scared. On Saturday, 20-30 students left the hostel. Their parents had come to pick them up,” he said. The students have said they will not return till the accused youths were arrested and the campus security tightened. The main accused, Palikh alias Lucky, is a final-year law student from Delhi’s Najafgarh. Three other students – Lucky’s brother Rahul, his friend Himani, a final-year BSc student, and Nitesh – have been booked in the case as well. After the shooting, the police had directed the university to tighten security arrangements on the campus and ensure that no one enters the compound without producing an identity card. The college was also asked to increase the number of CCTV cameras and security guards. But students alleged that outsiders can still be seen on the campus. “There is hardly any security here. Anyone can enter the university. The students have not been offered any assurance by the officials. Those who are still in the hostels are very scared. They are not stepping out of their rooms,” said a hostel boarder who did not wish to be identified. On Saturday, a group of students took out a rally urging witnesses to get their statements recorded. A similar march was organised on Friday as well. “Gradually, everyone will leave and they will only return when there is adequate security arrangement,” said another student. Ranjeesh Yadav, public relations officer, SGT, said security has been stepped up and they are talking to students to get details about the incident. “This has come as a shock to not only the students but also the administration. It is the first time in 21 years that such an incident has happened here. We are deploying more security guards,” he said. “Most students who have left the campus are from the deceased youth’s department and they are very scared,” he added. Initial investigation has revealed that Vinit and Lucky had a dispute six months ago. They got into an argument and later, a scuffle. It has been found that a girl had broken up with Vinit and moved in with Lucky. But she continued to stay in touch with Vinit and Lucky was not happy with this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/varsity-murder-many-wary-some-leave-hostel/articleshow/86920897.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Mumbai||By October-end, private hospitals can get 25 lakh doses/month of needle-free ZyCoV-D||PUNE: ZyCoV-D, the first vaccine to be approved for use in children above the age of 12 in India, will be also be made available to private sector hospitals across the country. The Centre’s supply principle in the ratio of 75:25 for public and private vaccination will remain applicable for this vaccine too. “If there are buyers, up to 25 lakh doses of the ZyCoV-D would be made available to private sector hospitals every month as the initial monthly vaccine availability will be 1 crore doses,” N K Arora, chairman of the Centre’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) told TOI on Sunday. However, 75% of the available doses would be reserved for vaccination of eligible adolescents at public vaccination centres for free, Arora clarified. The needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, has received emergency use authorisation for being administered to children. The three-dose vaccine is to be given with a 28-day gap between each dose. ZyCoV-D is going to be introduced in the country’s Covid vaccination programme by October 20. “The biggest challenge about this vaccine is its slow production. Initially, the manufacturer can only make available one crore doses every month. Private hospitals can procure 25% of the monthly production,” Arora said. However, he added that the private sector had not shown much interest in vaccine purchases after the new guidelines about Covid-19 vaccine supply in the ratio of 75:25 came into effect a few months ago. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Pune-based Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “Private hospitals will purchase the ZyCov-D vaccine, but this time they would be cautious in their approach. Initially, the purchases are likely to be smaller in size to assess the response. Again, the vaccine cost in private hospitals will also determine its uptake.” Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Hospital in Pune, said, “The private hospitals’ purchases of ZyCoV-D vaccine is likely to be slow initially. It is a three-dose vaccine, hence the vaccination cost is likely to be high which may also negatively impact purchase in the private sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-by-oct-end-pvt-hosps-can-get-25l-doses/mth-of-needle-free-zycov-d/articleshow/86924261.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Ramteke has been selected by the ministry of culture, government of India, for this ‘Retrospective Exhibition’ at NGMA which is considered a lifetime achievement award in the world of art and painting. The ministry selects artists for this exhibition on the basis of the artist’s utmost devotion and service in fine art. “This is a rare honour for any painter. The canvas and colour are synonyms of my life for more than sixty years now. I would like to continue working for as many years as I can,” said Ramteke. Ramteke is a born Nagpurian and an alumnus of Sir JJ School of Arts from where he got his masters degree in fine art in Painting in 1975. He has been a part of the institution as a professor and later retired as HOD of the painting department at Government Chitrakala Mahavidyalaya, Nagpur. Ramteke is known for painting the portrait of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar which has been officially accepted by the government. One can see the same at government establishments. Titled ‘Open Mind – A retrospective of Pramod Ramteke’, this exhibition is a milestone not only for him but also for fine art in Nagpur. Ramteke has now joined the league of Indian stalwarts of modern art. NGMA will send his catalogue to international art galleries as an eminent Indian artist. The exhibition will end on November 20 at Sir Cowasji Jehangir Public Hall of NGMA in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rare-honour-for-city-artist-ramtekes-expo-at-ngma/articleshow/86922924.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Goa||Love at first sight for Goa’s remote villages with hockey||Morlem: The gaggle of curious faces outside the school playground here in Morlem keeps swelling with each passing day. There are men riding in twos and threes on motorcycles, others on their bicycles. A few cars are also parked, as almost everyone who’s passing by wants a glimpse of the unusual action on the ground. On most days, you’d see school children simply run around or girls playing kho-kho and kabaddi. On other days, there will be a game of volleyball, football or cricket for the villagers. Now, they are trying their hand at an entirely different sport: hockey. “Hockey is the talk of the town,” says Patterson Andrade, president of Stars of Sattari. “This village (Morlem) is seeing hockey for the first time. These days word spreads fast through social media. The response is encouraging.” It’s not just Morlem. Nearby villages in Goa’s remotest Sattari taluka like Sonshi, Honda, Keri and Bhuimpal are all buzzing. All this is thanks to 35 school-going children between the ages of 10 and 14 who picked up the sticks for the first time and are attending the Pioneer Hockey Camp. A majority of the participants are girls, 11 of them from the Government high school in Morlem. “We had seen hockey only on television,” says 14-year-old Trusha Rani. “I never dreamed that I could play the sport myself. That too so soon. It’s a nice sport and we have decided that we will continue to play (hockey) even after this camp concludes.” Like several others at the camp, Rani has taken the game seriously, reporting for training almost half an hour early. It’s a welcome change from the 20-minute delay on the first two days when nobody knew what to expect. “You can see they are eager to learn,” says senior coach Alexander Remedious, Goa’s seniormost hockey coach who has trained players in Goa for three decades. “To get 30 children daily is very encouraging. We have more wanting to join but they’ll find it difficult to catch-up, so we train them on the sidelines.” Hockey is not just a technical sport but expensive too. A regular hockey stick costs anywhere between Rs 800 and Rs 1,200, possibly out of reach for many underprivileged families in this part of the world, where incomes are irregular and sometimes non-existent. There’s nothing to worry about though, as the Pilar Fathers’ Sports for Youth Development initiative in Sattari provides a helping hand. “Hockey is our national game and I’ve always been very patriotic,” says Fr Dominic Alvares who heads the programme. “Even after I became a priest, I always kept a stick in my room, so the love for the game has always stayed alive. When I came here, I thought of empowering the women, and what better way than handing them sticks? If not a stick, they’d be left with latnis (rolling pins).” Sattari is not alien territory to Fr Alvares, 60, a hockey champion during his school days at St Anthony’s high school in Monte de Guirim. Between 2006 and 2012, he spent six years in Birondem, and apart from galvanising the youth — keeping them away from alcohol and drugs — he also gave them a taste of hockey. As Fr Alvares returned to Sattari for a second spell, he found collaborators in Hockey Heritage Group Goa, Stars of Sattari and Hockey Kheluia, run by Peter Fernandes. Fernandes spent the last three years in Kolkata working with Khelo Rugby. Through the sport and its associated values, the organisation helped many disadvantaged children improve their lives. They want to do the same here, and it all starts in Sattari. “From my experience in Kolkata, I can say that underprivileged kids stay in a healthy circle if they are connected with sports,” says Fernandes. The trainees are in good hands and have been provided with the best of everything, including a surprise visit from Mumbai-based Clarence Lobo, who won the Dronacharya Award, a national honour given to India’s best sports coaches. “Some say it’s dangerous, but we find this enjoyable (game). I am going to convince my parents to buy me a hockey stick,” says Kustal Shetkar, a student from Swami Vivekananda Vidya Mandir in Keri. Until last week, Shetkar played football and cricket during his free time. Now he’s in love with hockey, just like many others here, even though until now, few of them watched a match or even knew what a stick looked like.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/love-at-first-sight-for-goas-remote-villages-with-hockey/articleshow/86922934.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Bareilly||BJP functionary among 41 booked for ‘rioting’, ‘threatening’ cops inside thana||Bareilly: BJP's youth-wing district president, Abhishek Chaubey, and his men allegedly barged into a local police station in Moradabad, misbehaved with the cops on duty and threatened the station house officer (SHO) saying, “we will now show you exactly how disturbance is caused" if the names aren’t taken back from the FIR. A purported video of the "act of rioting" has gone viral where the accused can be seen misbehaving with the cops and throwing away paperworks inside the police station. The district president and his supporters were earlier booked under section 107/16 of IPC for "causing disturbance" at a Durga pooja event. They were reportedly involved in a heated argument with the pooja organisers following "an issue with the venue". According to the police, Chaubey and his supporters were booked for creating disturbance after they allegedly had a dispute for organising a Durga pooja event at a location under Majhola police station. The police had booked people from both sides after the incident. Chaubey, however, along with his aides, barged into the police station and allegedly misbehaved with the cops inside. He and his men also threatened the Majhola SHO, Jeet Singh, demanding he immediately withdraw their names from the FIR and said they would now show “how disturbance is caused”. The police personnel, present at the place, filmed the incident which later went viral on social networking sites. Taking cognizance of the viral video and a complaint filed by the SHO, a case was registered against all the accused men. On Sunday, Moradabad SP, Amit Anand, said, “An FIR has been registered against 41 people - six named and 35 unidentified - under IPC sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), among others. Further legal action is underway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bjp-functionary-among-41-booked-for-rioting-threatening-cops-inside-thana/articleshow/86919028.cms||Maria Khan
---||India||CIC says Bucher papers could shed light on J&K accession||NEW DELHI: The disclosure of files provided by India’s second army chief General Sir Roy Bucher to Nehru Memorial Museum and Library about J&K related to the period of 1947-49, which may throw light on accession, is in “national interest”, the Central Information Commission has observed. The Commission stopped short of ordering disclosure of these crucial documents, withheld from public on orders of the ministry of external affairs. Information commissioner Uday Mahurkar has instead asked the NMML’s central public information officer “to take up the matter with higher officials” and “secure the necessary permission” before sharing the information with RTI activist Venkatesh Nayak. CIC didn’t specify if the information can be disclosed if there is an objection from “higher officials”. Nayak had sought the documents from NMML under the transparency law but it was denied to him without citing any exemption clauses in the RTI Act. “Keeping in view the facts of the case and the submissions made by both parties, the Commission observes that the aim of the appellant (is) in national interest,” Mahurkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cic-says-bucher-papers-could-shed-light-on-jk-accession/articleshow/86925978.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Ludhiana mayor promises development projects worth Rs 350cr for industrial city||With elections round the corner, the MC machinery is pressed into action, and the civic authorities claim that development works are being done at war footing. Mayor Balkar Sandhu claimed that they have either allocated or approved development works worth Rs 350 crores. He talks to TOI’s Nidhi Bhardwaj about this, fogging in the city and more. Q) Why the MC could not start fogging in time and why there is no transparency in the schedule for fogging? A) This is totally wrong. We had started fogging 15 days before health department asked to do the same. We had started fogging with small machines first because these are more effective as compared to big machines. Even with big machines, the fogging was being done with a set schedule. The health wing of MC has prepared a detailed schedule on the basis of which the fogging was taking place in various areas of city. As far as transparency is concerned, the schedule is always shared with area councilors and they know when big machine will come to their areas and they get it done under their supervision. Q) The MC got one survey in city to check number of households from where door to door garbage is collected and it revealed that very less garbage collectors were engaged in this task. How is door to door garbage collection possible with such a low number of collectors? A) This is for the first time any such survey has been carried out in city. We earlier had no contact with garbage collectors but now at least we are handy with a list of these collectors along with their areas. Now a detailed study will be conducted and more steps will be taken to improve this data. The object is to improve the service and we will do it at the earliest. We will also give e-rickshaws to these garbage collectors who are basically from informal sector and idea behind survey was to check condition of door to door garbage in city and if we have to do any changes the informal sector should not get disturbed. Q) The Opposition leaders say Congress government did nothing in past 4.5 years and now when elections are round the corner you are reminded of development works. Your say? A) The Opposition means to criticize everything, whether we are doing good or bad. Just ask from the councillors from other parties whether I have denied any of their work. And how can Opposition say nothing happened in past few years of Congress ruling because the Jagraon Bridge completed during our tenure and also for the completion of National Highway bridges, Congress MP, MLAs and even me sat on protest and got these bridges completed. Now it was due to rainy season the road works got delayed but it has started with great pace. We will repair and construct roads before winter season. Q) The roads have always remained in poor condition and despite claims, the MC has failed to keep check on quality work. How MC will find solution to this issue? A) It is true that roads have remained a major concern for the residents because most of the roads are made with bitumen which has lesser life than cemented roads. We are planning to shift towards cemented roads. Though these will be little costly and it takes time to build these roads but these will have at least long life. Q) What is plan for development of city in remaining time you have being mayor of city? A) The major thrust will be on maintaining cleanliness in city because it is very important. Then comes the implementation of complete plastic ban in city. A drive was started earlier but due to shuffling of staff the drive had stopped. It will again kick off in the next few days. I will also appeal to the residents that they should also stop using the plastic products especially the polybags. During rainy season, I personally visited many areas where water logging is a major issue and in most of the cases I saw that road gulleys were blocked with plastic carry bags and when we remove those bags, the water drained out in 15 minutes. Before onset of rainy season, we got sewer cleaned properly and this is the reason that water drainage time reduced. In the next few months, the 24x7 canal based water supply project will also see the light of the day. Apart from this, additional 15 percent street lights will also be installed before Diwali for which directions are already issued to Tata company. Q) The funds remained short all throughout your tenure. How you will ensure there should be enough funds to complete ongoing works? A) Who said so? We are not short of funds. Initially there was shortage of funds when even employees were not getting the salaries. But now situation has improved a lot as we pay salaries to the employees in first week. Now the state government has issued directions for pay commission and we are arranging for that as well. Along with current dues, we will pay the arrears of retired employees as well. Q) With third wave of Covid 19 knocking at door, how is the MC is planning to fight out situation? A) We should pray that third wave should not come but still we are ready to fight. We had sanitised the city earlier, and even now we have stock. We will work in close coordination with the health department to keep Covid at bay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ludhiana-mayor-promises-development-projects-worth-rs-350cr-for-industrial-city/articleshow/86919041.cms||---

Unlike applications like Google Earth, the machine-learning algorithm even helps identify details like the type of crops being cultivated in a field. The tool is expected to be immensely helpful in town and country planning, and in carrying out environmental studies, among other uses. Rahul Kotru, Musab Shaikh and Satyaswarup Banerjee of the electronics and telecommunication (ETC) branch have developed the deep learning algorithm, under the guidance of lead scientist, Varsha Turkar, who heads the department, and Shreyas Simu. This data can be captured during day and night independent of weather and climatic conditions. Every object on earth can be identified with its unique characteristics with the help of this data. Traditionally, this kind of work requires rigorous field work with human centric time-consuming processes. However, the technique developed by Don Bosco College’s students helps identify and demarcate these objects without human intervention. Turkar had received a total of Rs 26 lakh in funding from ISRO as part of a four-year-long project, and a part of this sum was utilised in the development of this algorithm. “When you open Google Earth, you can see any part of the earth up close. But the problem with the satellite taking those images is that they require the Sun as a source of light. One cannot take images during rainfall or when the weather is cloudy. We work in the microwave domain. These kind of satellites send microwave signals, which can penetrate through any kind of weather,” said Turkar. She said an algorithm is required to analyse the data, a technology for which is available in countries like Japan, at a high price. “We were able to receive data for analysis free of cost because of the association with ISRO and IIT-Bombay. Work on such algorithms is being carried out elsewhere in India as well, our algorithm uses semantic segmentation. The machine learning algorithm analyses such images and can tell even the kind of crop being grown in a particular field. Microwaves have the ability to categorise each and every characteristic on earth,” explained Turkar, who has been working in the area since 2007 and has a PhD from IIT-Bombay. Her team of students began working on the project from March 2020, and the algorithm is the result of their work over the last one-and-half years. The project is part of NISAR, which is the biggest collaboration between NASA and ISRO. “For a developing state like Goa, the algorithm will be a boon in disguise as it helps to identify and demarcate various features like settlement, forest, waterbodies, and mangroves, etc, from images acquired by the satellite. It may also prove helpful for town planning, civil engineering, environmental studies and agriculture,” said Kotru. “With its very high accuracy of 95 per 100 samples, this model can be implemented across the globe successfully,” said Turkar. It may be noted that this model has already been tested for areas in San Francisco, Mumbai and Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-isro-aid-don-bosco-engg-students-develop-tool-to-survey-land-online/articleshow/86922981.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

These include daily vaccination drives and round-the-clock vaccination centres offering options for the public for inoculation. Hence, the number of people getting vaccinated has come down during the mass vaccination drives, a senior health official said.Of the total 1,09,582 people vaccinated in the district, 72,047 received their second dose.Unlike previous weeks, people preferred Covishield to Covaxin this week, a senior health official said. Those preferred Covishield include elders as well.Usually, the aged population and people with comorbid conditions prefer Covaxin. Since Covaxin is yet to be recognized by WHO and overseas travel may not be possible with Covaxin, people are choosing Covishield, an official said.Stating that they were expecting more people to come for inoculation, deputy director of health services P Aruna said that phone calls were made, and SMS sent to 3.4 lakh population eligible for the second dose and 2 lakh people who are yet to take even a single dose. “We are planning to reach out to the eligible population at their doorsteps in the coming days, she added.Now, that we could narrow down the eligible population, we are planning to reach out to them at their doorsteps in the coming days, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/over-1-lakh-jabs-administered-in-mass-vax-drive/articleshow/86922961.cms||---

From then till now, the state has increased its count of wildlife sanctuaries to six and has even got one national park. However, more than fifty years after the first protected area was notified, Goa does not have wildlife management plans for any of its sanctuaries. At present, the Goa government has assigned the task of formulating wildlife management plans for all seven protected areas in the state and officials said that these are in their final stages of being approved. In the absence of management plans, as exist for sanctuaries across the country, Goa’s protected areas remain open to exploitation. Recently, the diversion of protected forests in Mollem for three linear projects has come under fire from citizens across Goa. “Our head office has received the wildlife management plans for the Bondla and Cotigao sanctuaries. Work on plans for the remaining sanctuaries and the national park are in the final process. These will be implemented after government approval,” additional principal chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar told TOI. The management plans give direction to conservation of biodiversity and natural resources within the sanctuary. They set management goals for specific protected areas over a given period of time and provide strategy for species management, anti-poaching, patrolling, curtailing illegal trade in wild animals and plant species. “I am involved in making the wildlife management plan for the Mhadei sanctuary. After carrying out consultation with various stakeholders, the development objectives that can be agreed upon by all are in the process of finalisation. I will submit the plan at the earliest to the forest department,” professor of zoology at Goa University, Nitin Sawant said. After the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary with 133 sq km area was notified, the protected area in Cotigao in Canacona was notified in 1968 with 85.6 sq km area. This was followed by the sanctuary in Bondla in Ponda with 7.9 sq km area in 1969. While Goa got its lone national park at Mollem with 107 sq km area in 1978, the state’s only bird sanctuary the Dr Salim Ali Sanctuary in Chorao was notified in 1988 with 1.7sq km area. The Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in 1999 with 208.5 sq km area and Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary in 1999 in Sanguem with 211 sq km area are the other protected areas in the state. Nearly 80% of Goa’s forests are spread over hilly terrain and conservation of soil and moisture and improvement of tree cover was the first objective set for the state’s forest department after Liberation. However, mining activities, expansion of agriculture and horticulture and various developmental activities have led to degradation of the state’s forest cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/54-yrs-after-first-sanctuary-goa-still-has-no-mgmt-plan/articleshow/86922954.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Shooters from 16 countries participated in the event.This is the second international medal for Niveditha after winning a bronze medal in the 25m sports pistol event at the 14th Asian Shooting Championship held in Doha in 2019.She was confident about winning a medal even before attending the event, Niveditha told TOI. “More than the competition, it was challenging to get selected to the Indian contingent as the competition was intense during the selection. Shooters as young as 14 years were giving tough competition in New Delhi. I was one among the two shooters from Tamil Nadu, who got selected. Such intense competition helped me perform better and win medals.”The pandemic dimmed competitive spirit as there were no events and shooters could not visit the range for practice, said Niveditha. “After the selection process was notified, I started preparing and gained the required momentum.”Niveditha’s father B Saravanan is her coach and mentor. Now working with a local NGO, Saravanan was in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and took voluntary retirement in 2017 to train his daughter. “She was exposed to guns from her childhood. I knew she would do well and started training her despite knowing that it is an expensive sport. We cherish her victory as an outcome of our collective sacrifice,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-student-bags-silver-medal-at-world-shooting-championship/articleshow/86922977.cms||---

His advocate produced correspondence that D’souza had sent to the forest department in 2020, stating that he was taking care of many injured and ailing birds and animal species, and so did not hide this fact from the authorities. “The letter my client, Pradeep, had written to the conservator of forests (Thane) in March 2020 had given all details on how wildlife bird species like kites, barn owls, egrets and even bats were kept in his house. However, the forest authorities did not act on it then. The court acknowledged the letter and since the investigating officer did not raise any objection to the bail, he was granted bail,” said advocate Siddh Vidya. Last week, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and forest officials jointly raided D’souza’s house and seized scheduled species like kites, parrots, barn owls, and bats among others while also arresting him under the Wildlife (Protection) Action, 1972. Honorary wildlife warden Sunish Subramanian said: “Legally speaking, it is wrong to keep protected bird species as they should be handed over to the authorities or professionals who can give them proper treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-who-had-kept-wildlife-at-sobo-home-granted-bail-in-mumbai/articleshow/86924524.cms||Vijay Singh

The incident shocked the filmdom as voting began for the most bitterly-contested polls on Sunday, but the victim, hero Siva Balaji, chose not to engage in any further confrontation with his attacker, actress Hema. Hema caught hold of Balaji and dug her teeth into his left arm as he looked back in horror. Rival actors Prakash Raj and Manchu Vishnu had led a vigorous campaign before polling began during the day. Siva Balaji, a contestant for the post of treasurer from the Manchu Vishnu-led panel said, “We noticed a person, ostensibly a Prakash Raj panel supporter distributing pamphlets in the ‘no campaign’ area. We tried to stop him, but he fled. While this was happening, I put my hand on the railing and Hema bit me,” When asked to clarify her act that was caught on tape, Hema admitted to it. “Yes, I bit him. No one bites without any reason. Ask him why I bit him. He should be able to explain,” actress Hema, who contested as vice-president on behalf of the Prakash Raj-led panel, said. Actor Naresh, who is the current president of MAA supporting the Manchu Vishnu panel, said the polling was peaceful. “Except for the fact that Hema bit Siva Balaji. There should be no biting but only voting,” he quipped. The incident left Hema red-faced as more meanings were being read into her biting Siva Balaji. “It was not a love bite. I was angry that he was trying to prevent me from going to the rescue of a person who was being targeted,” she explained later. After the polls later in the evening, Siva Balaji was taken to NIMS by his colleagues. “I was given a TT injection and first aid. I will also have to take antibiotics for five days as per the doctor’s advice,” he said about the medical treatment he received for the bite.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maa-polls-go-down-from-bytes-to-bite/articleshow/86924530.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The duo from Garia Nathpara, were headed to the Sreebhumi Puja pandal when the accident happened around 2.10am. The bike was going at a very high speed and the impact flung the couple 15 feet in the air. Indrajit Dey landed on the pointed ends of the median railing. According to cops, the angled ends pierced his neck, severing his head from the body. His wife Subhra’s condition is extremely critical and she is battling for life at SSKM Trauma Centre. The incident brought to light the rampant traffic violations involving two-wheelers over the weekend. Police records show that Chaturthi alone saw 2,086 two-wheeler prosecutions, 306 of which were for riding rashly and 366 were for not wearing helmets. About 758 bikers were challaned for parking in a way that obstructed vehicle and pedestrian movement. Lalbazar has formed special raid teams that will work after 10pm from Panchami to nab errant bikers. According to Pragati Maidan police and Beliaghata traffic guard, Dey was reportedly speeding despite warning signals put up on that stretch. The Pragati Maidan police has registered a case in this regard. “The spot where the accident took place has a speed radar gun and an electronic speed signage installed to warn riders. There were also red-and-white reflector caps on the median and retro-reflective lights to highlight the lanes. The spot has everything that a modern traffic system requires. Yet, once again, a person had to pay a price for being reckless,” said an officer. Sources said Indrajit’s sister and brother-in-law were travelling with them, but they were behind them since they were not speeding. “We initially sent Subhra to a private hospital off Bypass. But since no emergency bed was available, we shifted her to a private hospital in Salt Lake. A few hours later, her family shifted her to SSKM,” said an officer. Police said two guard areas through which the Deys had ridden before the accident reported maximum violations by two-wheelers on Saturday. While Garia guard reported 136 cases, Tiljala guard reported 121. These were a shade behind Jorabagan traffic guard that issued 163 challans. Barely 20 minutes after the Chingrighata accident, a truck tried to avoid a rogue biker and rammed the Pragati Maidan police station and Tiljala traffic guard, damaging four police bikes and a patrol vehicle. The police complex, under Tiljala Guard opposite Science City, was saved only because of the guard rails. Officers said these types of accidents have led them to continue block chain raids. “There were reports that several new riders and motorists are not conversant with the laws and believe cops will not act against them in the festive season. It was also reported from pockets like Beliaghata-Narkeldanga and Anandapur that rogue bikers were racing on deserted roads. Hence, surprise raids are being carried out even during Puja. They will continue this season, leading up to Diwali,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-speed-bypass-bike-ride-ends-in-fatal-crash-for-man/articleshow/86920951.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This is despite the diversion offered to skip the Mettupalayam Road when pillars have been erected as part of the flyover work.Traffic congestion has become perennial on the stretch during peak hours, which is also leading to accidents.While only a few feet are available for vehicles, encroachment in the form of temporary shops is further restricting free flow of traffic. “The national highways department could have skipped the flyover at Periyanaickenpalayam Junction as a four-lane would have been sufficient,” said S Ramanathan, a resident of Periyanaickenpalayam. “There are a lot of encroachments on the road when we go towards Periyanaickenpalayam after the Sri Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya. Makeshift shops, eateries and sellers of toys and dolls have been occupying the side space.”“People park vehicles to make use of the shops, adding to the congestion,” said S Suhail Ahmed, who travels to Coimbatore from Mettupalayam on his two-wheeler daily. “Many of these shops are operating with the help of local politicians, because of which the local bodies are refusing to take action,” he said.A senior official with the national highways department said that the encroachers are warned on regular intervals. “The shops disappear for a few days, but appear at a different location on the stretch. Local body and revenue officials should also regularly monitor and ensure removal of temporary shops,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/temporary-shops-choke-traffic-at-periyanaickenpalayam-junction/articleshow/86922983.cms||---

It would be the sixth sero survey since July 2020. The latest one conducted in August showed that 86% of those surveyed had antibodies to the coronavirus. “We plan to conduct more surveys and believe it would be good to conduct one right after the Diwali festival,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. He, however, added that a final decision on the dates is yet to be taken. The BMC has set October 31 as the deadline to vaccinate the adult population — 92.3 lakh — with at least one shot of the Covid vaccine. “The next sero survey will help us assess the effect of the vaccination in creating antibodies,” said Kakani. Sero surveys would also help health officials assess the drop in antibody levels among the population. The first sero survey conducted in July 2020, showed that seroprevalence was at 57% in slum areas and 16% in non-slums, but the second survey done a month after showed seroprevalence had dropped to 45% in slums and marginally risen to 18% in non-slum areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-another-sero-survey-planned-post-diwali/articleshow/86924267.cms||---

The breach occurred at Maneri, Dhangarwadi in Maharashtra’s Dodamarg taluka around 3.30am on Sunday. This resulted in water gushing into nearby fields and plantations, prompting the authorities to stop supply to Goa. The Tillari dam provides raw water to the Assonora treatment plant which then supplies it to Bardez taluka and parts of Bicholim. Last year the canal had breached at Sateli-Bhedshi Khanyale, a few kilometres away. A few months ago, the left main canal of the Tillari, which runs through Maneri, Dodamarg, Kelichetemb and Ambeli, had collapsed at Mhavlankarwadi, which is adjacent to the present breach area. Farmers, who have pineapple plantations, had brought this to the notice of the engineer concerned. The dam provides raw water to Bardez taluka and parts of BicholimOver the last 30 years, crores of rupees have been spent on repairs, but such breaching incidents continue on the Maharashtra side. CM Pramod Sawant has already approved a project to lay a pipeline to carry water from Tillari to Goa border to help avoid such incidents. It may be recalled that water supply to Goa was cut off a few months ago during the monsoon due to landslides in several places on the left and right canals of the Tillari dam. Following the canal developing a crack, the water pressure began causing the soil filling to collapse forcing the authorities to stop supply immediately. Even after this, water continued flowing from the canal till 10am and stopped only by 11am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tillari-canal-develops-crack-water-supply-to-goa-cut/articleshow/86923014.cms||---

Hence, I would like to tell the contractors who take up future projects to be very cautious while executing the projects and ensure quality.”On alleged irregularities in housing board, the minister said the ministry is ready to probe specific complaints and take action.Muthusamy, who inspected the badly damaged housing unit at Singanallur in Coimbatore, said that the government is ready to build new flats in place of the damaged apartments. “The state government is ready to construct 960 houses for the residents of Singanallur housing unit. But there are four residential associations. They have to come together and only then we can sort this out properly. Else, there will be problems and the work will be stuck,” he said.The four-storey structures at Singanallur were built 30 years ago.Talking about the complaints of residents in Hudco Colony in Peelamedu, the minister said that the pathway to Surya Nagar, Senthil Nagar, Anna Nagar and other residential localities was blocked because the road they were using was a private land, which the owner had closed. “I will discuss with officials and ensure they get a proper pathway.”At Gobechettipalayam in Erode, the minister participated in bhoomi puja for construction of a municipal daily vegetable market building, which will be constructed at a cost of Rs 6.99 crore.Addressing reporters, Muthusamy said the building will have two storeys with 102 shops. “Construction will be completed within a year. It will have underground parking facility.”Drinking water projects worth Rs 52 crore will be implemented across the district and 99% of the potable water-related issues would be solved once all projects commence, the minister said. “The government had allotted Rs 32 crore for road laying works. Solid waste management project would be implemented at the cost of Rs 2 crore in Gobichettipalayam municipality and Rs 50 lakh would be spent on a park for the municipality,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-will-assess-stability-of-tnhb-buildings-minister/articleshow/86922989.cms||---

Several citizens also shared tip-offs about hooligans in their areas. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said that similar operations will be undertaken at successive periods against criminals. “If anyone wants to share any information with us, they are free to call our control room number 112. We had explicitly demonstrated yesterday (Saturday) that city police will not allow any hoodlum to browbeat locals,” he said. The operation carried on Saturday titled ‘Clean Bowled’ led to the 145 persons with illegal firearms, liquor, drugs and property documents. Over 185 suspects were rounded up for the interrogation at different police stations of the city. Lamba told TOI that police officials are currently examining voluminous note sheets prepared after a detailed interrogation with history sheets and gangsters. “These (note sheets) will become the basis of further action,” he said. Meanwhile, DCP (North) Paris Deshmukh said that two other accused were arrested on Sunday as part of the exercise. He said that police teams are investigating the role of different suspects in narcotics, liquor and arms cases. “Based on the input from suspects, the next segment of accused will be held,” he said. Police said many of those held or rounded up for interrogation included members of notorious criminal gangs such as Munna Talwar, Ganga Pandit, Vinod Pathena, Vijaypal, Kamal Meena, Sandeep Bangla and Shehjad Dudi. “The raids yield a trove of information about the fledgling gangs and their modus operandi. We have also learned that some of these criminals regularly intimidated their neighbours and shopkeepers in localities,” Lamba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/day-after-op-clean-bowled-calls-flood-police-control-room/articleshow/86923083.cms||---

It is not alone. From a cricket association to a conglomerate, from certain government departments to a minority’s development association, more than a dozen institutions have queued up outside the Kalina campus for a total of 100 acres of land. The Kalina campus is spread across 243 acres of land with 42 acres being free for development. As the issue of parting away with a piece of the campus heated up with the Mangeshkar family asking for five acres to set up a music school, it has come to the fore that 16 institutions have written to the university asking for a piece of the campus. Some have agreed to pay a lease, most others are silent on the financial bit. While IIT-Bombay wants at least 15 acres, the Mumbai District Football Association has asked for 5.5 acres, the Mumbai Cricket Association needs a “vacant plot” to train youngsters and the state wants to start a 15-acre skill university. There are minority associations wanting to construct hostels, one wants to house the Urdu Bhavan in the varsity, the Homi Bhabha state university wants to build its hostel and staff quarters. All proposals were sent to the governor, who asked the V-C to draw up the redevelopment plan and calculate their own land requirement. “The redevelopment plan of Mumbai University is in progress and the university itself requires additional land to cater to its own demand,” said the governor’s letter. “Any issue of alienating land for the Mumbai University may henceforth be done only after consultation with the honourable chancellor and that too in a holistic manner.” The proposal for the establishment of the Master Deenanath Mangeshkar international music school, for which there is need for five acres, and a request for five acres to set up the Dadasaheb Phalke school for performing arts were forwarded by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/varsity-flooded-with-requests-for-land-at-its-kalina-campus/articleshow/86924549.cms||Hemali Chhapia

---||Mumbai||World’s first rapid test kit for silicosis developed in Mumbai lab||MUMBAI: For the first time in the world, scientists working in a public laboratory in the city have come up with a rapid test to ascertain if a person has silicosis, a progressive lung disease caused by exposure to silica. The kit – which detects levels of serum CC16 in blood — is the result of a collaboration between the Mumbai team of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and the National Institute for Occupational Health. “India has a high burden of silicosis with an estimate of 1.25 crore patients at the moment,” said Dr Shyam Sundar Nandi from the Mumbai laboratory, who is one of the scientists who developed the test. The invention, called a point of care test, is similar to a pregnancy test kit and detects levels of serum CC16 in a drop of blood. “Based on the concentration of the serum, we can diagnose the patient with severe, mild disease or is likely to develop it in the near future,” said Dr Nandi. When the value of serum CC16 is between 6 and 9 ng/ml, it is indicative of early silicosis. The research work has been accepted in the medical journal, Nature Scientific Reports.  “Every day, eight crore people are exposed to silica in India alone,” said the scientist. Silicosis is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when nothing much can be done to prolong the person’s life. Most silicosis patients develop tuberculosis, the condition could affect the TB control programme. “India wants to eliminate TB by 2025, but this is not possible if we cannot control silico tuberculosis and silicosis,” Dr Nandi said. The Indian Council of Medical Research, NIV’s parent body, has already transferred the technology to two firms in Delhi and Chennai. The Indian government plans to make it mandatory for industries involving silica dust exposure to conduct CC16 rapid test twice every year for its staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/worlds-first-rapid-test-kit-for-silicosis-developed-in-mumbai-city-lab/articleshow/86924283.cms||---

For two months, Dubey, then 52, kept delaying a visit to her doctor assuming it be a regular boil on the body. A mamography revealed Dubey, a postgraduate in Arts, was suffering from breast cancer. In April this year, 48-year-old Dr Harsha (name changed) went for a regular screening and discovered her breast cancer was in early stage. Medical and surgical oncologists said the two cases stress the importance of regular screening by all women after the age of 40 and self-screening of breasts after from the age of 21. They said every year, 90,000 women die of breast cancer mainly due to lack of awareness, denial and late reporting though the disease is curable if detected early. The patients come from all socio-economic backgrounds. Dubey took up social work to spread awareness about the killer disease and also counsel patients and relatives. Dr Harsha has completed her therapies and is on the recovery path in just five months. As October is celebrated as World Breast Cancer awareness month, a survivors’ meet was organized by Kingsway Hospital on Sunday. There were over 50 participants with some of them narrating their trauma and how they overcame the challenges. Consultant medical oncologist Dr Samiksha Dubey said myths like “even the prick of needle in the breast will spread the cancer” still exist. “Beside late reporting, patients are not forthcoming in starting the treatment. This shifts the disease to the next stage while early treatment holds key in surviving breast cancer,” she said. Consultant surgical oncologist Dr Nitin Bomanwar said about 50% to 60% patients report in advanced stage of breast cancer. “The treatment has evolved and it now depends on patient to patient. If MRM (removal of entire breast) is preferred in some cases, breast conserving surgery too is being performed to ensure the woman is not psychological hurt,” he said. Dr Mona Rai, pain and palliative care physician, said palliation plays the most crucial role in the treatment of survivor’s as well as those with bleak chances of survival. “While fighting the disease, women also face questions like who will look after their kids. Such thoughts make there suffering worse,” she said. Dr Saurabh Prasad, consultant oncologist, said use of gadgets like chemo port have minimized the side-effects as seen in routine chemotherapy. “New drugs and patient-specific treatment called targeted therapy are available and breast cancer patients must take benefit of it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/early-detection-treatment-key-in-breast-cancer-fight-docs/articleshow/86923079.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC won’t quash murder bid case against mentally ill man||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court refused to quash an attempt to murder case filed against a 27-year-old man diagnosed with a mental health condition who allegedly threatened and assaulted two policemen when they chased and intercepted him for roaming around maskless in breach of Covid-19 guidelines last May. The man was allegedly armed with a chopper at the time the incident is said to have taken place. The man, a south Mumbai resident does not understand the charge or his actions, had no intention to hurt and hence would be unable to even face a criminal trial, argued his counsel Rizwan Merchant. The HC said: “A prosecution cannot be quashed on the ground that an accused is incapable to defend himself on account of unsoundness of mind.” In its judgment on October 6, a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar cited chapter 25 of the criminal procedural law rule book, the Criminal Procedure Code, to state that it makes “elaborate provisions” to address the situation when an accused is found to be incapable of defending himself at the trial on the grounds of “unsoundness of mind”. The prosecution case is that the man allegedly threatened to assault the police if they came forward to catch him. Two polive officials ultimately caught and overpowered, then disarmed him. The injuries he allegedly caused to the police were “simple injuries”, said Merchant citing the medical certificates. He argued that the FIR itself shows the man had no clue that his actions were wrong. He also produced medical papers of the man and his treatment of “psycho-pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy”. Additional public prosecutor S R Shinde said there was “ample material” to show he was “cognizant” of his actions and “intentionally hurt” the policemen, adding that there was nothing on record to show mental health issues prior to the FIR. The HC said that when insanity is pleaded in criminal cases, the court has to ascertain what the mental state of the accused was when the crime was committed. It said that in this case, there is nothing that would shed light on his state of mind that day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-wont-quash-murder-bid-case-against-mentally-ill-man/articleshow/86923122.cms||Swati Deshpande

Actor Rituparna Sengupta understands that every time she walks up to her son Ankan’s bedroom. His drawings still adorn the walls while his books and toys peep through the shelves. The smell of his shirts tucked in the closet makes her feel his presence in his absence. When the Goddess comes home during the Pujas, Sengupta is unapologetically emotional. In a short film directed by Pritha Chakraborty, the actor invites her Boston-based son to return and reunite with her in Kolkata during the Pujas. Viewers can watch the film at Facebook.com/phireyeshokolkata . Sengupta, along with percussionist-turned-music director Pt Bickram Ghosh, actors Ankush, Riddhi Sen, Bonny Sengupta, Neel Bhattacharya, Priyanka Sarkar, Oindrila Sen, Trina Saha and Ushasi Ray, joined TOI to celebrate this homecoming with a new edition of our tribute to the city: Phirey Esho Kolkata. Read AlsoPuja organisers reach out to struggling artists, vendors in KolkataSeveral puja organizers in the city have roped in those struggling to survive in the post-pandemic period by tapping their talent and providing them with puja-related work and business. One has even designed its theme as a tribute to their idol-maker who died of Covid last year.Pujas not only mark the return of Durga, but also of those who have shifted base elsewhere for studies or work. “The last time we spent the Pujas together in Kolkata was in 2017. I was in Singapore with my family during the Pujas in 2018, but was off to the US for Puja shows in 2019. Covid took away all the fun from Durga Puja last year,” Sengupta said. This year, Ankan has shifted to Boston for studies. “The day before the Phire Esho film shoot, his toy guns, bow and arrow, and Spiderman costume toppled out of the closet, making me pine for him even more. How I wish we could meet during the Pujas,” Sengupta said. It has been a difficult 18 months of pandemic and bereavement has left permanent scars in too many families. Ahead of the Pujas, Ghosh lost his dear friend, percussionist Pt Subhankar Banerjee. Though concerts, music direction and personal album launches have kept him busy, he knows that such scars will need time to heal. “My college friend, Sourav Mukherjee, lost his father recently. After college, we parted ways when he settled in Mumbai,” Ghosh said. As part of the Phire Esho Kolkata campaign, Ghosh requested his friend to return to the city. Revisiting old ties while the world is in a festive mood is also part of healing, he said.

Every family is now scripting its own homecoming story. Mousumi Deb joined the TOI campaign to invite her Pune-based sister to return while Swayampurna wants a reunion with her London-based brother with whom she is yearning to spend Pujas in Kolkata after eight years. Phire Esho Kolkata, for them, is no longer just a phrase.

Sources said pregnant women at the hospital after initial check-up are instructed to go to the nearest private nursing home for ultrasound (USG) test. The nearest private clinic where USG facility is available is more than 3 km away. Would-be mothers complained that not only do they have to shell out money for USG at private nursing homes, they often face a lot of difficulties in covering the distance during summer. At private clinics too they have to wait for hours. Proper drinking water or washrooms are not available at the site. Durga Tudu and Sunita Hansda from rural parts of Ghatshila alleged that when they went for USG at the sub-division hospital, the health staff after Covid-19 testing instructed them to get their test done at a private clinic. With no option in hand, they had to stand in queue outside the clinic which was 3 km away. After covering the distance on foot, both the pregnant women felt sick. Dr Shankar Tudu, in charge doctor at the sub-division hospital, said:"Due to non-availability of USG machine, pregnant women cannot be tested at sub-divisional hospital." Nitu Tudu said often pregnant women from rural parts of Ghatshila travel more than 27 km to the sub-division hospital for check-up and with no USG facility there, they have to travel another 3 km to a private clinic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/expecting-moms-face-usg-hurdle-in-ghatshila-hosp/articleshow/86921272.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

While fire safety officials said that they will start an inspection in next few days the organisers said that they haven’t been communicated anything in this regard. Talking to TOI, the station in-charge of Audrey House police station, Dilip Ram Keshri, said, “We haven’t started the inspection yet but it will be done within the next two days.” Asked if any instruction from the district administration has been given in this regard, he said, “We haven’t been given any instruction but I will inquire about it on Monday with senior officials.” The puja organisers said that they are installing fire extinguishers in their respective pandals. “Before we open the pandals, we will install fire extinguishers at all the required places to avoid any mishap,” the president of Bhartiya Yuvak Sangh Bakri, Bazar Ashok Choudhary, said. Asked if the district officials have inspected the pandal, Choudhary said that no one has visited the pandals yet and they are managing everything on their own. “Earlier, these inspections used to be over well in advance.” TOI tried to contact district officials over the delay but repeated calls to senior officials went unanswered. Ranchi has witnessed two major pandal fires in the last few years – one at R R Sporting club’s Ratu road pandal where around 70sqft of area was destroyed in fire and in 2018, the pandal in Kishoreganj area caught fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fire-safety-audit-of-puja-pandals-yet-to-begin-in-ranchi/articleshow/86921230.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Ironic it may seem, cops have emphasized precaution and safety as the main stay of the list of 11 instructions which were posted on Vadodara Rural police’s Facebook page. In the list, the 10th instruction mentions: “For safety of women during Navratri, if possible do not go out alone and if need be, dial women’s helpline 181.” Talking to TOI about the instructions, superintendent of Vadodara Rural police Dr Sudhir Desai said, “I will get it (instructions) checked. It depends on how it is interpreted, but I will get these checked and corrected.” The other instructions are to celebrate only till midnight, not gathering more than 400 people, following Covid-19 guidelines, use of mask and sanitizer, maintaining social distancing while dancing, and also if possible, visit the garba venue only if both doses of vaccines are administered. The list also advises following organizers’ instructions and contacting the police control room or nearest police station for any harassment by anti-social elements. “The instruction is quite problematic. Instead of asking women to take precaution and not go out alone, the police should ensure that there are enough cops out there so that the women revellers feel safe,” said Simran Desai, a resident of Manjalpur. Desai added that the state has a unique image in the country of women’s freedom to move safely anytime of the day and night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/women-fume-over-rural-polices-safety-advisory/articleshow/86920547.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Considering it was the last Sunday before this year’s Durga Puja, the traders had appealed to the state government to relax its guideline which stated that commercial establishments will have to be closed to prevent public gatherings. However, there was no response from the state to their appeal. The city’s prominent stores such as Firayalal, Kashmir Vastralaya, the shopping malls on Mahatma Gandhi Road, Circular Road and Ashok Nagar kept their shutters down. On Saturday evening, all of them were bustling with customers who were busy picking their choicest of new apparel before the festivities. Small-time traders’ hope to make sales on Sunday was also dashed. “For more than a year now, we are running into losses due to the Covid-19 lockdown. We had pinned our hopes on the Durga Puja for a turnaround in businesses. But the government dampened our plans by banning businesses on Sundays,” said Pradeep Barman, the owner of Maa Cloth Stores at Sarjana Chowk on Mahatma Gandhi Road. Sanjay Suneja, the owner of another apparel store in Upper Bazar, said: “Now, we are banking on the upcoming marriage season as Durga Puja turned out to be a damp squib owing to the restrictions. Last year, the marriage season was also marred by the restrictions on the number of customers. But this year, there are no curbs for the time being.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-ban-on-sunday-shopping-before-puja-dashes-traders-hopes/articleshow/86921175.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Coal dispatch from NTPC site begins after agitators end strike||HAZARIBAG: The indefinite strike by raiyats (landowners and farmers) since October 5 at NTPC’s railway siding at Banadag in Kusumba village ended hours after a confrontation took place between the agitators and the police on Sunday. Deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand said coal dispatch to thermal power plants, which was disrupted since the agitation started, has begun. Talking to TOI, Anand said, “A five-member team of district officials had met with the protesters and heard their grievances. We have assured them to get their issues resolved at the earliest, following which the agitators ended their protest in the evening. We have also directed NTPC to address all the problems as soon as possible and to ensure that such protests don’t take place in future. Coal dispatch has begun but it will take some time to regain normalcy.” Earlier in the morning, police resorted to lathicharge, and used water cannons and smoke guns on the protesters, who were protesting under the banner of Visthapit Raiyat Morcha and making 30 demands. Over two dozen protesters and police personnel were said to have suffered injuries in the incident. Police said they were forced to use mild force after the agitators turned violent and began pelting stones on administrative officials and damaged government vehicles. The officials had visited the protest site to hold talks to end the stir. Former MP and secretary of CPI, B P Mehta, however, accused the administration of siding with NTPC to forcefully end the stir. Addressing a press conference, Mehta said, “The incident occurred at a time when I had fixed a meeting for talks between the protesters and administration officials. The demands of protesters are genuine and use of force on a peaceful dharna was unwarranted.” Some of the demands of the protesters include payment of compensation for crop loss due to coal pollution in the area, actions to curb environmental pollution and providing jobs to the locals among others. Supporting the demands, Mehta said, “More than two dozen villagers were injured in the incident and admitted to the HMCH. About 17 people were detained. We condemn the police action. CPI, which has already supported the agitators, will now strongly stand in their favour.” Mehta claimed that local BJP MLA Manish Jaiswal had a role in Sunday’s violence, saying his son had taken the contract for coal transportation from NTPC. Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Barkagaon, Amba Prasad, who had lent support to the agitators, visited the site after getting hearing about the violence. She said, “I will soon meet the chief minister to raise the issue and seek action against the guilty officials.” Hazaribag SP Manoj Ratan Chothe, however, defended their action. He said, “The protesters began pelting stones on officials and also damaged many vehicles. More than a dozen policemen were injured. In defence, we had to use force.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/coal-dispatch-from-ntpc-site-begins-after-agitators-end-strike/articleshow/86921129.cms||Abhijit Sen
---||Ranchi||KGBV mishap: Parents cry foul over kids’ treatment||RANCHI: The parents of six students who were injured last month when a balcony of a state-run school collapsed in Hussainabad sub-division are running from pillar to post in trying to arrange proper treatment for their wards, while the government has left them high and dry. Now the aggrieved families have threatened to sit on an indefinite protest outside the school after Durga Puja and have submitted a memorandum to Hussainabad SDO Kamleshwar Narayan. On September 9, the balcony of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya collapsed, injuring six students, of which two were girls. The two girls were referred to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi while the rest were taken to a hospital in Palamu. Of the two girls, one Kavita Kumari lost her vision owing to neurological complications as a result of the mishap. Her father works as a daily wager in Palamu while her mother is a housewife. She needs to be treated at a higher medical centre but her family cannot do that due to scarcity of funds. Talking to TOI, her brother Krishna Metha said, “My sister has multiple on her head and elsewhere but she is at home now as we cannot afford a high-end hospital for her treatment.” Krishna even alleged that Kavita was left unattended for hours when she was first taken to Rims, forcing him to take her to a private hospital here. “From 11pm to 7am, my sister was left unattended at Rims. Fearing for her life, I then rushed her to Medica hospital. Initially, my Ayushman card (a government-sponsored scheme under which one can free avail treatment up to Rs 5 lakh) wasn’t accepted but later on, officials from the Palamu administration intervened and promised to take care of the treatment cost. After about 10 days, my sister was discharged and she was asked to come back later for check-ups. But when I took her to Medica for a neuro check-up, I had to pay Rs 1,000 for consultation and this continued every time I took her for check-ups,” he claimed. Krishna has accused the district administration and government of abandoning them as they haven’t provided proper care or compensation. He said, “We have been going to government offices and KGBV management for help but it is all in vain. The school warden didn’t even pick up our calls and now he has blocked our numbers.” Ravindra Ram, the parent of another injured student, said, “How can the government or school authorities abandon these injured kids till they get clinically well when the mishap happened at a government school premise? Also, no compensation of any kind has been provided to anyone.” When TOI contacted district education officer (DEO) Upendra Narayan for a comment on the matter, he didn’t say anything by citing that he was busy while school warden Chanda Kumari didn’t respond to TOI’s calls. Narayan said, “The parents had come to meet me two days ago with their woes. I have asked them to coordinate with the authorities concerned. I had spoken to the DEO on the same day when the parents came and he said he has asked the warden to coordinate with parents. We are looking into it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/families-of-injured-kids-in-palamu-kgbv-school-mishap-running-from-pillar-to-post-for-medical-aid/articleshow/86920541.cms||ASRP Mukesh

All that is required now is that people exercise caution and not waste electricity by switching off lights, fans and air conditioners while leaving the room,” K K Verma, the managing director of the state-owned power transmission company Jharkhand Urja Sancharan Nigam Ltd (JUSNL), told TOI. “The strike by raiyats (landowners and farmers) at Pakri Barwadih coal mining project in Hazaribagh district since October 5 at NTPC’s railway siding at Banadag in Kusumba village, which ended on Sunday, has been hampering coal production and dispatch. Coupled with that, heavy downpour throughout last month and the subsequent flooding of mines had severely affected coal mining operations. The resumption of coal supplies to National Thermal Power Corporation’s super thermal power plant at Barh in Bihar would completely solve the state’s power crisis,” he added. Prabhat Kumar Srivastava, the general manager (Ranchi) of Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Ltd stressed the state capital has been receiving 260MW a day against the peak time’s demand of 280MW. “The shortfall in power supplies at Ranchi is just within 15MW to 20 MW during peak hours and completely manageable. Though the demand for power is likely to shoot up during Durga Puja, we are confident of managing the situation with minimum of inconvenience to people. However, we would also need the cooperation of our consumers and people must keep in mind that electricity is not to be wasted,” Srivastava said. Meanwhile, Tenughat Thermal Power Station (TTPS), the state’s lone thermal power generation unit at Lalpania in Bokaro district, is generating over 150MW power every day, officials said. “We have one to two days of coal reserves. The Central Coalfields Ltd is supplying one coal rake each day which is enough to operate one of our units. TTPS has two units, with an installed capacity of 440MW. We are currently running only one unit due to coal shortage and generating over 150MW of power. We have also requested the coal major to ensure uninterrupted supply for continuous power generation,” TTPS’s managing director Anil Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-cause-for-panic-state-electricity-department/articleshow/86920636.cms||Tapas Biswas

With the latest upgrade, the response time of the city police is set to improve by 10 minutes instead of the 25-30 minutes of the past, said city police chief Amitesh Kumar who supervised the historic transition from 100 to 112. After 112 was introduced, city police have managed to prevent several crimes, attend emergencies promptly and also extend assistance on a quicker note. Four minors were saved after police received information through 112 since September 27. Also, four kidnapping cases were reported, 27 cases of domestic violence against senior citizens and another 222 incidents of torture of women were reported. With the double call filtering mechanism at the primary contact centre and second contact centre, blank, prank and spam calls dropped to almost zero. The daily average calls to the control room is barely 140 now from around 10,000 in the past. Substantial manpower and resources used to be wasted in the past to tackle pranks and blank calls to the police control room. The global emergency number of 100 was being already made obsolete in India in 2019 when the erstwhile Union home minister Rajnath Singh had launched it in several states across India a couple of years back. In 2015, the telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) had approved the use of 112 as the universal emergency number. Kumar said a new command and control centre (CCC) at the control room office was set up where 15 despatchers and one supervisory officer will handle all the 112 related calls. “Around 40 four-wheelers and 75 two-wheelers were alloted to operate as an emergency response vehicle (ERV) to teach or track down the live location of the caller. Mobile data terminal devices are fitted in all the ERVs (115),” he said. Calls from 100 are being diverted to 112. “We will now use 100 only when there is any emergency,” he said, adding, 112 is technologically more sound and offers multifarious benefits. The CP said calls are being routed through the central command centre at Navi Mumbai. “If the calls are related to the police then the system tries to locate the vehicle closest to the spot with the help of the mobile data terminal (MDT) and alerts it with the brief details of the call content. The vehicle will reach the caller with a map guiding it and no manual calls for direction and route like in the past,” said Kumar. “The system in place is jurisdiction neutral. The nearest vehicle has to respond and reach the spot irrespective of the jurisdiction whether city or rural or any police station. Cops attending the spot would have to report back to the system regarding action taken,” said the CP, adding the process of feedback and its assessment is still in its nascent stage but is developing fast. The number 112 is pre-configured in mobile phones. “In case of latest handsets or smartphones, pressing the power button thrice would trigger the panic call while in case of older handsets the long press of ‘5’ or ‘9’ would do,” he said, adding, 112 India mobile app too can be downloaded. As per the statistics furnished by city police, 112 numbers received information relating to Covid violations too apart from 260 cases of assaults and another 282 queries regarding public services. How 112 is better than 100 - 112 is a globally recognized single emergency number, adopted by most of European countries, common wealth nations and mapped to emergency numbers in USA and Canada - Most of phone handsets are manufactured with pre-programmed 112 as emergency number to be dialed with single key press - TRAI allotted this number for the purpose of single emergency number in India in May 2015 - The Govt of India decided to introduce 112, so that people travelling in other States/UTs don't need to know all local emergency numbers - 112 is easy to remember and the only emergency number you need to remember in India - You speak the language of the state in which you call. Else, you can provide the necessary information in English/Hindi Advantages - Dial 112 directly from phone - Press power button on smartphone 3 times quickly to activate panic call - In case of feature phone, long press ‘5’ or ‘9’ key to activate panic call - Use 112 India Mobile App (available in Google Playstore and Apple store) to activate a panic call to ERC - Language will not be a barrier for taking help - From call taker to police help all event will get recorded in system - Because of live location of caller/distress person, he/she will get help immediately. - By dialing single emergency number 112, we will get assistance from police, ambulance, firebrigade. - Multiplex system, i.e. multiple calls will get handled by the system - Calls are getting diverted to 112 (except Jiom it will be donew within a week) - Calls on an average now (Sept 27 to Oct 6) | 140 - Pranks calls/ spams get filtered at PCC(Primary contact center) & SCC(Secondary Contact Center) - In system currently responce time is set to reduce from 30 min to 10 min - New Command and Control Center (CCC) set up at CRO, Nagpur, where 15 dispatcher and 1 supervisory officers will independently handle 112 related calls - Also, 40 four-wheelers & 75 two-wheeler to work as ERV (Emergency responce vehicle), provided with Mobile Data Terminal devices. Highly dedicated MPLS line used WHAT ABOUT 100? As all calls from 100 are diverted to 112, no need of 100 system installed at CRO. Will be used in case of emergency||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rip-100-112-is-new-emergency-number/articleshow/86921058.cms||Soumitra Bose

Those arrested are prime accused Mukesh (30) and his three accomplices Dilip, Sikander and Hansraj. Police said victim Jagdish Meghwal allegedly had an affair with Mukesh’s wife, who has been living separately in Suratgarh for the past two years. Meghwal often visited the woman in her rented accommodation in Suratgarh. When Mukesh learned about it, he became furious. On Thursday, Mukesh along with his accomplices followed Meghwal and abducted him when he was returning from Suratgarh after meeting the woman. The accused allegedly took Meghwal to a farm and assaulted him with sticks and shot a video of the act, which later went viral on social media. The purported video shows an injured Meghwal begging for water and his tormentors giving him something to drink, before assaulting him repeatedly. The accused then brought Meghwal to his village and dumped him. His family rushed him to a hospital, where Meghwal died within hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/three-days-after-dalit-lynched-in-rajasthan-4-arrested-minor-detained/articleshow/86926001.cms||---
---||India||Experts build kit for rapid silicosis test||MUMBAI: For the first time in the world, scientists working in a public laboratory in the city have come up with a rapid test to ascertain if a person has silicosis, a progressive lung disease caused by exposure to silica. The kit – which detects levels of serum CC16 in blood — is the result of a collaboration between the Mumbai team of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and the National Institute for Occupational Health. “India has a high burden of silicosis with an estimate of 1.25 crore patients at the moment,” said Dr Shyam Sundar Nandi from the Mumbai laboratory, who is one of the scientists who developed the test. The invention, called a point of care test, is similar to a pregnancy test kit and detects levels of serum CC16 in a drop of blood. “Based on the concentration of the serum, we can diagnose the patient with severe, mild disease or is likely to develop it in the near future,” said Dr Nandi. When the value of serum CC16 is between 6 and 9 ng/ml, it is indicative of early silicosis. The research work has been accepted in the medical journal, Nature Scientific Reports. Silicosis is an incurable lung disease caused by inhaling large amounts of crystalline silica dust for years. Silica is a naturally found element found in stones, rock and sand; people working in cement factories, marble cutting work or mines are highest at risk for the disease. “Every day, eight crore people are exposed to silica in India alone,” said the scientist. Silicosis is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when nothing much can be done to prolong the person's life. Hence, early detection of silicosis could help the patient. Most silicosis patients develop tuberculosis, the condition could affect the TB control programme. “India wants to eliminate tuberculosis by 2025, but this is not possible if we cannot control silico tuberculosis and silicosis,” he said. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the parent body of NIV, has already transferred the technology to two companies in Delhi and Chennai. The government of India plans to make it mandatory for industries involving silica dust exposure to conduct the CC16 rapid test twice every year for its employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/experts-build-kit-for-rapid-silicosis-test/articleshow/86926004.cms||---

The arrested drug peddlers were identified as Shivraj Ramdas Harijan (33), a Santacruz west resident and Nigerian national Okara Ouzama. NCB claimed that Harijan’s name cropped up during interrogations of Arbaaz Merchant and from Harijan they recovered 62 grams of charas from near Rajesh Khanna Garden in Santacruz west. NCB recovered intermediate quantity of Cocaine from Ouzama, stated Sameer Wankhede, zonal director NCB. Wankhede in the press release said that a total of nine independent witnesses were involved in the whole operation and Manish Bhanushali and K.P Gosavi were among them. Neither of these two Independent witnesses. Manish Bhanushali and K.P Gosavi, were known to NCB officials before they carried out the raid last Saturday, the release said. Public Prosecutor Advait Sethna told.the holiday court that the investigation was at nascent stage.and that this person has vital links. Harjian’s lawyer Sandeep Sherkhane told the court that Harijan has been falsely implicated. “The NCBhas failed to show the link with co-accused Arbaaz Merchant and was picked up while he was chatting with his friends.’’ The court granted one day custody of Harijan. Nigerian national Ouzama will be produced before the court on Monday. NCB claims that Harijan as well as the Nigerian are two drug suppliers to Arbaaz Merchant and hence the accused person is to be verified and corroborated. The NDPS court is likely to hear Aryan Khan’s bail application on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nigerian-among-2-drug-sellers-held/articleshow/86926019.cms||Ahmed Ali

The student outfit claimed that there were many irregularities in the appointment process carried out by the varsity. The ABVP has levelled the allegations just days after a group of three syndicate members sought written response from the university officials over a couple of appointments. Addressing media persons on Sunday, ABVP leaders said that the recruitment process at the university has been postponed by the state government due to severe irregularities carried out by MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas. Alleging injustice to candidates from reserved category, ABVP leaders said that although there were enough suitable candidates for 11 posts of the reserved category, only one was appointed. “There were many candidates who were suitable for the posts but only those who know and are close to VC are selected,” alleged Himalaysinh Zala, secretary of ABVP Gujarat. He alleged that the interview committee had one representation from the reserved committee who ironically is also chancellor’s nominee for the last many months. Alleging malpractice in the appointment of an associate professor in the Department of Business Economics at Faculty of Commerce, Zala said that going against all norms, VC’s close friend was invited as an expert in the interview panel. “Ironically, the candidate who was finally selected has done her PhD under the same expert who was called by the VC at the last moment to become part of the interview panel,” said Zala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/abvp-alleges-irregularities-in-recruitment-process-of-msu/articleshow/86920599.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||New proposal to nullify pilots’ licence if not used for 3 years||MUMBAI: Pilots who don’t use their flying licence for over three straight years stand to lose it, according to an amendment to the existent aviation regulations, proposed recently by the civil aviation ministry. For thousands of jobless pilots in India, the draft amendment, if passed, would mean spending thousands of rupees every three years to fly in order to hold on to their flying licences. Currently, that minimum mandatory flying to keep a licence valid needs to be done only once every five years. The extraordinary gazette, published on September 30, lists the draft rules amending the Indian Aircraft Rules-1937 and is currently open for objections and suggestions till the month-end. The draft rules increase the validity of a Commercial Pilot Licence and the higher, Airline Transport Pilot Licence to ten years from the current five years. But with a condition, which appears on page 18. It states: “In case where the privileges of the licence has not been exercised during the validity period of licence, for a period exceeding 3 years, the applicant shall be required to requalify in examinations and skill tests required for issue of such licence before exercising the privileges of such licence.” “The new rules will reduce the workload on the aviation regulator as each licence will come up for renewal every ten years and not five years,’’ said a flying training instructor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-proposal-to-nullify-pilots-licence-if-not-used-for-3-years/articleshow/86926060.cms||Manju V

AGAB president Agapito Menezes said that a decision has been taken to increase the price of pao to Rs 5 in Salcete from November 1. “I strongly condemn the date November 1 to start the sale of pao in Salcete, when entire Goa has peacefully accepted the price of pao for Rs 5,” Fernandes said. “The decision of AGAB is totally unacceptable.” Fernandes said that the AGAB’s decision is a “mockery” and driven by “malafide intentions” that will hurt the future of bakers. The AGAB increased the price of pao to Rs 5 on October 2 but after the association’s joint secretary opposed the price, the association walked back on its decision and decided to increase the price of pao in Salcete from November. Fernandes said that the AGAB should have suspended the joint secretary for indiscipline. “If the price rise is delayed when the public supports, it will be a disaster for bakers and never in future there will be any further rise, because non-Goans want more commissions and turnover,” Fernandes said. Menezes blamed non-Goan bakers for poor quality bread saying that though the price had been increased, the size of the bread in some places had become smaller. Both the associations had sought assistance from the government, but with no support coming through and with prices increasing, the bakers said that they have been forced to increase prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/price-of-pao-shows-rift-between-bakers-associations/articleshow/86921775.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Most Covid cases at Candolim health centre among visitors||PANAJI: The Covid-19 case tally of the Candolim primary health centre, under whose jurisdiction the state’s most popular tourist areas fall, has ranged between 40 and 50 for the last few days, with an average of three to four new infections reported every day. Most of the cases reported have been among travellers. “Most of the time fresh cases reported pertain to travellers, tourists as well as those who visit for work purposes. Covid-19 infections among locals are very much under control,” health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth said. On Friday, the caseload of the Candolim primary health centre was 47. Though the cases are under control in the tourist hub, locals are still worried as they can’t forget the April and May nightmare when Goa recorded a huge rise in infections. The Candolim-Calangute belt had turned into a hotbed of infections for those two months. The concern of the locals is heightened when they spot tourists crowding and not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Yet they are worried that voicing their concern will antagonise the trading community that is looking forward to a good season with hopes of recovering the losses of the last two years. “It is not that Covid-19 has disappeared, but tourists and some locals behave as if the pandemic happened ages ago. If we raise our voices, we are told to keep quiet. They ask us if we will feed people who lose their jobs,” a local from Candolim said. In the favour of the economy, the authorities ignore Covid-19 protocol violations by the trading community as well as travellers. “I pray there will be no third wave, and that vaccination will keep us safe,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/most-covid-cases-at-candolim-health-centre-among-visitors/articleshow/86921819.cms||Bindiya Chari

Sawant said that the Prime Minister has acknowledged the work of Swayampurna Goa.

For the upcoming polls, the Canacona block can recommend up to three names and Congress will select one based on their loyalty to the party, acceptability among Congress workers and winnability, Chidambaram said. He congratulated the Canacona Congress workers and said that their loyalty was invaluable to the party. It is the workers on the field who are the real soldiers of the party. They campaign door-to-door asking for votes for the party, they shout slogans, fix posters, carry flags and the candidate wins, but the winning candidates have betrayed the party in the name of development, Chidambaram said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stop-habit-of-giving-tickets-to-defectors-chidambaram/articleshow/86921970.cms||---

Congress observer for Goa, former finance minister P Chidambaram made this amply clear to party workers on Sunday when he stated that his primary task in the state was to make Congress “battle ready” in all 40 constituencies. “…One view is, ‘let’s have an alliance’, another view is ‘no, there shouldn’t be an alliance’. These aren’t matters which can be debated in meetings. But we are getting the party battle ready in all 40 constituencies, and Benaulim is no exception,” Chidambaram said while addressing party workers at Benaulim. Fighting polls on its own strength was also an option that Congress could consider, he said. “If necessary, we will fight in all 40 constituencies.” He urged party workers to participate in the election process, including that of selection of candidates. Asking them to enrol a good number of active party workers, he said that those active members will take all election-related decisions. Stating that the candidate will be selected from among the names recommended by the active party members, Chidambaram, however, said that the nominations will be evaluated on parameters of loyalty, integrity, acceptability among workers, and winnability. “We must put an end to the sordid chapter of defection. Let there be no repetition of 2017 (when 10 Congress MLAs switched over to BJP). You have the power to put it to an end if you help select a loyal candidate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/getting-cong-battle-ready-priority-not-pre-poll-alliance/articleshow/86921992.cms||---

The local leaders of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena jointly took a bike rally in the city. Shopkeepers having allegiance to these parties pulled down their shutters to express their solidarity with farmers across the country. A delegation led by former MPCC president Manikrao Thakre, NCP state general secretary Vasant Guikhedkar and Shiv Sena contact chief Santosh Dhawale met the collector Amol Yedge and submitted a memorandum of demands. Later, while addressing a gathering, Thakre condemned the death of farmers in Lakhinpur Kheri and demanded withdrawal of the farm bills. “Congress will continue its agitation till the demands are not met,” said Thakre. Others who spoke on the occasion condemned the incident and demanded those found guilty of “killing farmers be hanged to death in the open”. In the morning hours, the ST buses put on hold their routine services which resumed in the afternoon. According to SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal, the bandh was peaceful throughout the district and there was no untoward incident reported. He said the taluka places experienced bandh but it was peaceful.

A senior officer said that through the policy the government wants to set up charging stations in parking lots and government buildings. The officer said that they have received objections and suggestions to the policy and after considering the same, the policy will be placed before the cabinet for final approval. Globally EV technology is considered to be the game changer in the transportation sector. It offers advantages such as eco-friendliness, cheaper fuel cost, lower maintenance expenses, energy efficiency and increased safety, the senior officer said. The central government has instituted various enabling policies to promote the development of the charging infrastructure network. The senior officer said that a contextual approach is needed to ensure efficient and timely implementation of EV charging infrastructure, such that it meets local requirements and is optimally integrated within the electricity supply and transportation networks. To reduce the carbon footprint, the state government has decided to provide subsidies to 11,000 electric vehicles every year for a period of five years. The subsidy will be capped at Rs 25 crore annually. The subsidy will be given on a first come first serve basis, the senior official said. The subsidy will be disbursed in a single instalment that is 100% on purchase of the vehicle and production of documents of purchase — RC book and insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-starts-finalising-ev-charging-infra-policy/articleshow/86922044.cms||Murari Shetye

While addressing the gathering, Hooda said the people of Haryana had given them two years to fulfil their poll promises and but neither their manifesto nor the common minimum programme had been implemented by the ruling coalition in their tenure till now. “ The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) has decided that now it will go to the public in every assembly constituency and establish direct communication with the people to know their problem,” he said. More than four dozen MLAs and former MLAs were present in the event. The farmers, laborers, traders, workers, transporters, and people from different sections, who reached there, put their problems in front of the Opposition. After listening to these, Hooda said today no section in the state was happy with the coalition government. Hooda claimed that the number of people who highlighted their problems before the opposition in the CM’s area was many times higher than anticipated. “Today farmers are being beaten on the road with government sticks while their crops are taking a beating in the market. I have myself seen in the mandis of the state that smooth procurement of paddy has not started so far, despite the government changing the dates repeatedly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-starts-vipaksh-aakpke-samaksh-drive-from-karnal/articleshow/86922088.cms||---

Fr Jeorge Fernandes highlighted the role of tiatrists as promoters of good values in society and called them to be witnesses of such values in their lives. He encouraged them to come together to discuss issues plaguing them and the society and appreciated their concern towards society and the Church by conscientising people regarding various issues, cooperation and joyful entertainment. Fr Rony Fernandes conducted a group discussion session where it was suggested to help upcoming tiatrists and have a fund to support those of them in need, ill or aged.

Thakur also said the Bharat Bhakti Akhada, constituted during the Kumbh mela held in Prayagraj, will stage protests for freeing temples from the control of the government. “Our (Hindu) places (temples and shrines) remain under the government control with the district collector as chairman (of temple committees). The money (donated to) Hindu temples, including the big ones, is going to minorities. It goes to ‘vidharmis’,” she said while inaugurating Bharat Bhakti Akhada's office at a complex in Bhopal. The MP said the Bharat Bhakti Akhada will oppose the government’s control of Hindu shrines and temples. Thakur also said Hindus will take control, protect and develop their temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cash-donated-to-temples-going-to-minorities-sadhvi-pragya/articleshow/86926103.cms||---
---||Goa||Awaiting IIT-M report, GSIDC, L&T patch up Atal Setu with temp fix||Panaji: The Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) has submitted to IIT-Madras all the data that the Chennai-based institute requested for a peer-reviewed study to identify the cause for frequent potholes on Atal Setu. While GSIDC awaits a detailed report, it has asked L&T to patch up the huge craters that have developed on the 3.1km-long cable-stayed bridge. IIT-Madras has been asked to identify why the asphalt laid on top of the adhesive bond coat fails to hold the hotmix, and if Goa’s rainfall, humidity, salinity and temperature variations could be factors that hamper proper bonding with the bitumen. Several defects have surfaced on the Rs 546 crore bridge since its inauguration on January 27, 2019, prompting GSIDC to rope in IIT-Madras to find a solution. “The adhesion bond between the waterproofing membrane and the asphalt is slipping and not holding. The cause behind this needs to be studied. The adhesion bond is imported and IIT-Madras needs to look to see if the chemical may not be suitable for the Goan climate,” said a senior GSIDC engineer. Given that the same adhesive bond will be used for the Zuari bridge, engineers are keen to find a solution immediately. “The report is awaited. It is going to be a peer-reviewed study,” said the GSIDC official. Meanwhile, work is on at full pace to get the Merces-Porvorim ramp ready by November 15. Though GSIDC has set a target to complete the major repairs by October 31, officials said that the deadline will be missed. Officials intend to complete all road works pertaining to Atal Setu, including the Ponda-Panaji arm, by November-end. “The hotmix plants will open only on November 15, and once that happens, fresh hotmix will be laid in one go,” said the GSIDC official. Aside from the potholes on the bridge, the Merces circle intersection has also become a traffic nightmare with daily traffic jams and haphazard traffic management. The bad roads along with the ongoing repairs have turned the junction chaotic. Two vehicular accidents occurred on the bridge on successive days last week. Tourists on two-wheelers have also begun using the bridge, adding to the hazards that drivers face.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/awaiting-iit-m-report-gsidc-lt-patch-up-atal-setu-with-temp-fix/articleshow/86922240.cms||---

Navjot Singh Sidhu skips wedding of CM Channi’s son||CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu did not attend the wedding function of CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s son, which took place at a gurdwara in Mohali on Sunday. Amid reports of tension between the two leaders, Sidhu along with PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla and MLA Dr Raj Kumar Chabbewal headed to Vaishno Devi instead. “Darshan of the primordial mother during Navratras is synergising ... Washes away all the dirt from the soul!! Blessed to be at the lotus feet of Mata Vaishno Devi,” Sidhu tweeted. Sidhu had recently resigned from the post of PCC president over the decision to appoint Punjab’s advocate general and director-general of police without consulting him. Sidhu later demanded the removal of both the officials. Taking a dig at Sidhu, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) recently alleged that Sidhu was harbouring the ambition of becoming the chief minister. Referring to a video in which he purportedly appeared to be unhappy over Channi becoming the CM, SAD alleged that Sidhu was jealous that a member of the Dalit community had become the CM. The wedding of the CM’s son was a low-key ceremony and Channi along with his family reached the gurdwara by driving his car himself. The ceremony was attended by several leaders of the Congress, including MLAs and MPs. Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who is in news for being close to Channi, AICC’s Punjab minder Harish Rawat and Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh were among those who attended the wedding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tension-simmering-navjot-singh-sidhu-skips-wedding-of-cm-channis-son/articleshow/86926136.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Father abandoned toddler after choking life out of live-in partner||AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: The sensational case of abandonment of a toddler at Swaminarayan Gurukul Gaushala at Pethapur on Friday night took a murderous turn as probe during the weekend revealed that *Shyam, the child’s father, had killed his live-in partner and Shivansh’s mother in Vadodara before deserting the child in the cow shelter. Gandhinagar police, which cracked the case in a matter of hours, took Sachin to Bapod area in Vadodara on Sunday where the team found the body of Mehendi Pethani alias Heena stuffed in a suitcase.  The house from where the body was discovered was used by *Shyam and *Meena as their residence for the past few months. Abhay Chudasama, IGP of Gandhinagar range, told media on Sunday that it was a tale of double lives which Sachin was leading.  In Gandhinagar, Sachin lived with his parents, wife and a child while in Vadodara he was in a live-in relationship with Heena with  whom he had Shivansh. Sachin used to work in an Ahmedabad-based firm. Later, he took transfer to a Vadodara-based company in 2019 so that the duo could start living together. “Sachin had come in contact with Heena in Ahmedabad when she was working with another company in 2018. Sachin would live in Vadodara for five days and come to Gandhinagar for weekends to be with his family,” said Chudasama. We have not got any evidence of *Shyam and *Meena’s wedding: Cops Of late, Heena had started pressuring Sachin to put an end to the dual life and leave his wife for good. On October 8, *Shyam had a heated argument with *Meena over his week-long visit with his family to the native place in Uttar Pradesh. Heena reportedly got enraged and told Sachin not to go away for so long. “The fight escalated and in the heat of the moment, *Shyam strangulated Heena and later packed her body in a suitcase which he kept in their kitchen. He took Shivansh with him to Gandhinagar in his car and decided to abandon him at the gaushala which he was familiar with as he used to get his dairy supply from there,” said Chudasama. “He then went to the Gandhinagar residence and took off for UP when a police team intercepted him near Kota in Rajasthan.” The IGP said that they have not got any evidence so far of *Shyam and *Meena’s wedding. “We believe that *Shyam’s wife and family were also in the dark about his relationship,” he said. “We had arrested Shyam for abandonment. Now Vadodara police would charge him with murder.” Mayur Chavda, SP of Gandhinagar, said that the entire Gandhinagar police force including 85 officers of sub-inspector and above rank worked round the clock to crack the case. “*Shyam was depressed when brought back. He was counselled and questioned over his motive to abandon *Amit. It was then that he confessed that he had earlier killed *Amit’s mother,” he said. Meanwhile, Anita Rathod, *Meena’s maternal aunt living in Bopal, confirmed to police that *Amit was born in a maternity home in Bopal on December 10. He turned exactly 10 months old on Sunday. Rathod was not aware of his abandonment. She came to know about it when her neighbour showed her news clippings. Talking to TOI, she termed the murder and abandonment a ‘heinous act’ and said that Sachin should be hanged to death. Police have sent Shivansh to an observation home and dispatched his biological samples for DNA match. In Vadodara, the incident created equal sensation when police teams reached the Bapod apartment where *Shyam and *Meena used to live.  Bapod police station officials confirmed that a case of murder would be registered against *Shyam soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-father-abandoned-toddler-after-choking-life-out-of-live-in-partner/articleshow/86926102.cms||---
---||Goa||ACB gets docus from labour dept to probe ‘labourgate’||Panaji: The labour department has submitted all the documents related to the alleged Labourgate to the anti-corruption branch (ACB) of the directorate of vigilance to conduct further inquiry. A senior officer said that they have questioned some labour department staff to understand the procedure of labour enrollment. The senior officer said that they will check what was the criteria for enrollment and how money was disbursed and in whose account. The ACB had written to the labour department to provide documents to inquire into the Labourgate. A police officer said that based on the outcome of the inquiry, a first information report will be filed in the case. On September 15, last year, a day ahead of his retirement as Goa Lokayukta, justice (retd) P K Misra had directed the ACB to investigate the Covid relief scheme for BOCW (building and other construction workers), and to file an FIR against those who siphoned off funds meant for labourers. Misra had stated that if politicians and high-ranking officials were found to be involved, the investigation should be handed over to the CBI. “An FIR shall be filed by the ACB against unknown persons for conspiracy to siphon out money from the Goa BOCW welfare fund..., with a view to distributing largesse by stuffing the beneficiary register of the fund with beneficiaries who are not BOCWs,” Misra’s order had stated. The Lokayukta had recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General look into the functioning of the labour welfare fund, specifically the payments made to beneficiaries under Covid-19 schemes. The case follows a complaint by GFP, which had alleged that the state government had misused the scheme to channel funds to BJP functionaries, including some sarpanchs and panchayat members. The order stated that investigating agencies should conduct random checks of all beneficiaries of the scheme to determine how many of them are genuine and what motivated them to register as labourers. “Labour inspectors may be queried on a similar basis on incomplete forms, how and why they had verified them, whether they were coerced to do so, and their involvement in checking training programmes...,” the order read. In November, last year, chief minister Pramod Sawant had accepted the Lokayukta’s recommendations and directed the ACB to register an FIR and conduct an inquiry into the Labourgate. Misra had recommended that in order to get a complete picture, the ACB should speak to current and former bureaucrats of the labour and employment departments, to see if they had any doubts about the beneficiaries, and why 3,500 persons who registered between 2012 and 2019 were left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acb-gets-docus-from-labour-dept-to-probe-labourgate/articleshow/86922411.cms||---

In the discussion, the leaders said to have opined that in the fight against the BJP at the national level, there is no role for a third front. The Congress itself is the main opposition party in the country and hence no front without Congress will become successful or is possible. It is always better that all the opposition parties come together in the fight against the BJP. The farmers strike has put the BJP government in deep trouble. Hence there is a need for organizing such people’s movements against the BJP government at the Centre. The class-based organizations may intervene in struggles aimed at people welfare. The Left parties should come together in spearheading such anti-government agitations and should play an active role in the issues concerning the people, the meeting is learnt to have observed. The meeting also observed that aligning with regional political parties in each state would do good in the fight against the BJP. Instead of a comprehensive third front alliance, the regional alliance with the anti-BJP parties would be more effective. The draft political resolution prepared by the politburo will be given a final shape at the central committee meeting which is scheduled on October 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-congresss-role-vital-in-fight-against-bjp-observes-cpm-politburo/articleshow/86926099.cms||---

Singh was speaking at a meeting of the minority wing in the state capital on Sunday. “Netagiri ka matlab lootne nahi aaye hain... Fortuner se kisi ko kuchalne nahi aaye hain,” he told a gathering at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee convention centre. His statement was perceived as an expression of annoyance within the party leadership over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident that allowed the Opposition to train guns at the governing BJP. Singh’s assertion comes two days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath stressed the accused will not be spared. Singh said BJP functionaries should aspire to become Prime Minister or chief minister by sheer hard work. “Na khayenge, na khane denge... na soyenge, na sone denge (we won’t be corrupt, nor allow corruption and we shall not rest, nor allow rivals to sleep),” he said, adding BJP functionaries will bag votes through their behaviour towards people. “Our grassroots workers have strengthened the party organisation,” he said. “Aap party ka kaam is liye nahi karte ki mohalle wale aapki shakal se chiddh jayein (you don’t do politics to annoy people),” he said, in an apparent swipe at party functionaries responsible for setting in anti-incumbency against the party in run-up to polls. Singh said party workers should display dedication, instead of doing politics as a “part-time job”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/crushing-people-under-suvs-is-not-bjps-politics-up-unit-chief/articleshow/86926181.cms||---

The service will provide passengers assistants who will guide them right from the parking area to the boarding gate helping them in check-in formalities, baggage handling, conducting Covid tests, and speeding up security and emigration procedures. The main target customers are the elderly, pregnant and child passengers as well those travelling in the business class. The segment has been fast-growing and the service is available in all major airports around the world. Cial is also offering customized group packages and special rates for corporate events, wedding guests, film crew and vacation groups. Though the project was launched in April, it did not receive much attention due to the lockdown and the dip in the number of passengers. With the aviation industry witnessing a revival, the programme has been revamped and relaunched. P S Jayan, public relations & corporate communications manager, Cial, said though the facility was envisaged by Cial, the operations have been outsourced to Speedwing Air Services, which has rebranded the service as “Primefly Greet and Meet”. “There are three packages each in international and domestic sectors----basic porter service, seamless check-in and check-out, baggage handling, and completion of all formalities up to the boarding gate. Right now it is available for departing and arriving passengers in the domestic sector and departing passengers in international sector. Soon, it will be made available to arriving international passengers too,” Jayan said. Shaji John, business and marketing head, Speedwing Primefly, said the service is opted by many passengers both in domestic as well international sectors. Under the basic porter service, which costs Rs 300 per trolley, a customer can avail the service of one porter. Under the check-in/checkout service, a dedicated executive will assist the passenger from arrivals to checkout area (in case of arrival) or from parking area to check-in. A porter with one trolley for up to three pieces of baggage will assist with baggage handling and customs formalities. Under the feel safe service, besides all services under check-in / checkout, passengers will get assistance to clear emigration, customs, Covid test, and security check points with permissible priority queues. “Many people who are not frequent fliers are confused at the airport about the various procedures and these facilities will help them. It is most helpful for the differently-abled, pregnant women, elderly, kids travelling alone, etc. Many people, whose parents are going on visit visas abroad, are opting for it and the customers will be updated on their status via WhatsApp. Daily around 50 customers are opting for it and the numbers are picking up. The service can be booked either at the kiosk at the airport or via online,” John sai||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/meet-and-greet-facilities-revamped-at-cochin-airport/articleshow/86926183.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The certificate format has been revised by the National Council for Hotel Management, Delhi and has been updated on their website, principal IHM Donna D’Souza informed the Human Touch Foundation which0 had flagged the discriminatory certificate. Goa State Aids Control Society project director Dr Geeta Kakodkar had said that the format was in violation of the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act, 2017, and requested the institute to “revise its format for medical certificate with immediate effect”. Human Touch Foundation, which works in the area of HIV, sexual and reproductive health among other things, stated that the form acted as a barrier for one of its adolescents living with HIV, who was aspiring to seek admission for her higher education at IHM-Goa. The fear of their HIV status being revealed, and whether fitness would mean exclusion of those living with HIV, created a lot of anxiety in the adolescent, who ultimately did not attempt the admission, said the foundation’s CEO and founder, Peter Borges, in his complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hiv-certificate-not-needed-for-hotel-mgmt-admissions/articleshow/86922658.cms||---

In a Twitter post on Sunday, which was retweeted over 5,000 times within a few hours, the Pilibhit MP said, “An attempt to turn Lakhimpur Kheri into a Hindu vs Sikh battle is being made. Not only is this an immoral and false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault lines and reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity.” Gandhi, who was dropped from the party’s national executive just days ago, told TOI later that the issue has no religious connotations and the actual struggle for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri is about the “cruel massacre of poor farmers in the face of an arrogant local power elite.” He said: “To use the word ‘Khalistani’ liberally to describe the protesting farmers is not only an insult to the generations of these proud sons of Terai that have fought and shed blood on our borders, it is also extremely dangerous for our national unity if this provokes the wrong kind of reaction,” he said. Gandhi has in recent weeks often tweeted his support to the farmers’ protests against the three central farm laws. On October 5, he shared a video of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and demanded the arrest of the owners of vehicles that allegedly mowed down protesting farmers and a journalist. A day later, he and his mother, former union minister Maneka Gandhi, were dropped from the BJP’s national executive committee. Earlier, Gandhi had also written letters to UP CM Yogi Adityanath outlining several measures that could “help farmers improve their revenues and resolve their issues”, including increasing sugarcane prices, doubling the amount of the PM Kisan scheme and bonus on wheat and paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bid-to-turn-kheri-issue-into-hindu-vs-sikh-battle-varun-gandhi/articleshow/86926219.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The Margao-Sanvordem section is a part of the SWR’s Tinaighat-Vasco double-tracking project. Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd’s (RVNL) general manager of projects (Goa) Sashibhusan Sahoo, SWR’s transportation inspector Mehra Fernandes and other senior officials of Indian Railways were present on the occasion. “This is an important milestone in the double-tracking works on the Tinaighat-Vasco section which will further accelerate the progress of work on the remainder of the section,” Sahoo said. He said that work of electrification of the Goa section was also progressing at a fast pace. The Margao-Sanvordem section was commissioned following the completion of the non-interlocking works at Sanvordem, Chandor and Margao, SWR’s chief public relations officer Aneesh Hegde told reporters. Earlier, on September 23, the commissioner of railway safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, had conducted a statutory inspection and speed trial on the Margao-Chandor-Sanvordem section, following which authorisation was granted to SWR for opening of commercial services of passenger and freight traffic on the newly built double-line section. “Preparatory works for commissioning the Margao-Chandor-Sanvordem section commenced from September 25 and pre non-interlocking work was taken up from October 3. On successful completion of preparatory works, non-interlocking works were carried out on October 9 and 10,” a SWR press note stated. Three running lines each at Sanvordem and Chandor have been commissioned on signals with state-of-the-art electronic interlocking system, it was informed. “The commissioning of this double line will improve train mobility on this section as the trains need not wait for crossing,” SWR general manager Sanjeev Kishore said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-sanvordem-double-track-line-open-for-trains/articleshow/86922767.cms||---

He has convened a meeting on Monday to discuss the situation. “The shortage of coal has affected power generation in the country and the power crisis is expected to continue for nearly six months. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is monitoring the situation and people should cooperate with reduced use of power, especially during the peak hours,” Krishnankutty told reporters. The state has been experiencing a shortage of 15% power from the central pool for the past few days following the closure of four thermal stations due to coal shortage. “There is a shortage of 1,000MW power from the central pool. Yesterday (Saturday), we received only 30% of our daily quota from Kudankulam... If the situation continues like this for a long period, we will have to impose power cuts,” the minister said. Kerala is largely dependent on hydroelectric projects but there is a shortage in power allocation from the central pool. There is also a possibility of the state facing a reduction in power quota from other sources on the basis of long-term contracts. Krishnankutty said he was in favour of hydel power projects and that Kerala has a huge potential. He said 3,000 TMC of water is available, of which 1,700 TMC can be used for electricity generation. “But we are not using the same. We need to provide cheap electricity for industries in order to attract investment. Currently, from Idukki, we are generating electricity at a cost of 0.51 paise per unit. However, yesterday during the peak hour we had to purchase for Rs 18 per unit,” he said. Excess rainfall hitting the coal movement and coal-based power plants generating less due to record high rates have resulted in an energy crisis looming large over many states. About 70% of India's power generation is based on coal. Of the total 135 thermal power stations in the country, 110 are facing a coal shortage now. The KSEB authorities also warned of restrictions on power supply during the peak hours if the consumption went up and asked consumers to reduce power consumption to the minimum. The consumers will also have to bear the burden of KSEB buying power from outside at exorbitant rates.

So far, 50 schools have undergone the sessions and the coordinators are planning to reach out to 250 more. Sonali Patankar, founder of Responsible Netism that conducts the programme together with Human Touch Foundation, said the sessions focus on types of cyber crimes, gaming safety measures, screen balance and addiction red flags among other issues. The virtual sessions are held for an hour for students of classes V to VII along with their parents and teachers, and for one-and-a-half hour for those studying in classes VIII to X. “We don’t ask parents to spy on their children, but advise them to keep doors of communication open so that children don’t have to lie and be secretive about their online behaviour,” Patankar said. The coordinators said they have found parents to be fearful of technology, a factor that children use to their advantage. Hence, children are encouraged to proactively share their knowledge with their parents. “There are many instances of children having saved their parents from economic and financial fraud. They are very good at identifying fake profiles and suspicious messages and often advise parents not to forward certain messages without verifying them, etc,” she said. Students meanwhile are advised against sharing personal images on the internet. “We know that at some point, children will explore the internet and cross boundaries because there is something new that comes up on the internet everyday. But at the back of their minds, they will know what the repercussions are. We tell them what to do if they fall in distress and where help is available,” she added. Where schools are concerned, the free platforms used for conducting online classes are far less secure than the paid platforms. Patankar suggests that a disclaimer and guidelines be shared with students about what is allowed and what is not and the repercussions if they violate rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyber-safety-sessions-for-students-parents-teachers/articleshow/86922822.cms||Lisa Monteiro

While on one hand Urmila Devi was welcomed with flowers post midnight when she reached her village in Bhadohi the following night, the village head organised a felicitation ceremony to celebrate the achievement of Varsha Maurya in Fatehpur district. The two were felicitated by CM Yogi Adityanath at the day-long conclave that touched upon all aspects of water conservation by bringing sectoral experts and policy makers on a common platform. Five other water warriors from other parts of UP were also felicitated — Anil Singh (pond development), Meghnad (reusing waste water), Sajal Srivastava rain water harvesting design), Rajiv Tyagi and Raman Kant (River rejuvenation). Urmila Devi, is a native of Ajaypur village, that lies in the Ganga floodplain marked by challenges in keeping drinking water sources clean. Urmila developed a plan for water point restoration and convinced the community members to contribute to the initiative to rejuvenate the hand pump water point for safe and potable drinking water. With handholding from WaterAid India, she was able to solve the water contamination problem in her village. Her effort has fetched her accolades and laurels on various platforms, including UNDP’s women water champions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/villagers-felicitate-winners-of-times-water-conclave/articleshow/86926258.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Mumbai||13 coal-powered units shut, but no cuts in Maharashtra for now||MUMBAI: Coal shortage has led to shutting of 13 units at seven of the thermal plants catering to state power utility firm MSEDCL, but its MD Vijay Singhal allayed fears, saying they “have prepared a plan to procure power from (the national) exchange and hydro sources and ensure there is no load shedding across the state for at least a fortnight”. Singhal urged consumers “to use electricity sparingly during the peak consumption hours of 6am-10am and 6pm10pm to balance demand and supply”. “It will also help reduce the demand which is now 18000MW daily,” he said. Besides around 17,000MW thermal power, hydropower and other sources help meet the daily demand. Thermal power generation has reduced to around 14,000MW. ‘Protocol for power supply if situation deteriorates’Shortage of coal is a national issue, but we are trying our best to tackle it in Maharashtra and ensure zero load shedding,” MSEDCL managing director Vijay Singhal told TOI. “We have a thermal generation of around 14,000 MW and due to the shortfall, we have to purchase electricity from the power exchange at exorbitant costs which is as high as Rs 20 per unit,” he added. Another senior official said the situation should improve in a fortnight, else MSEDCL will have to set a protocol of prioritising distribution of electricity in various sectors — industrial, urban, rural areas — across the state. Thermal power generation has been declining for the last few days due to coal shortage across the country, an official said. In the state, 3,330MW power supply has been cut off. Those shut now are Mahagenco’s Chandrapur, Bhusawal and Nashik units of 210 MW each, Paras-250 MW and Bhusawal and Chandrapur’s 500 MW each. Apart from this, four units of 640 MW of Postal Gujarat Power Limited (Gujarat) and three units of 810 MW of RattanIndia Power Limited (Amravati) are also closed, it is learnt. “At present, power is being procured from the open market. Due to the increase in demand for electricity across the country, the purchase price of electricity has also become expensive. 700MW is being procured from the open market at a rate of Rs 13.60 per unit,” an official said. In addition, electricity is being provided through Koyna Dam as well as other small hydropower plants and non-conventional energy sources. Demand for electricity has also increased due to rising temperatures in the state as coal scarcity is getting more serious. As per the grid data, MSEDCL supplied 17,289 MW of electricity in the state (excluding Mumbai) on Saturday. On Sunday, the demand for electricity at 11.30 am was 18,200 MW in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/protocol-for-power-supply-if-situation-deteriorates/articleshow/86925608.cms||Somit Sen
---||Nagpur||World leaders not taking youth climate activists seriously, says Greta||Nagpur: Her ‘blah blah blah’ made complete sense. Her chastising of world leaders for disregarding climate crisis is laudable. The newly turned adult minces no words when it comes to demanding a liveable tomorrow. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg tells members of the global media collaboration Covering Climate Now that she will attend November’s COP26 despite the summit’s potential for “empty talk” and “greenwashing”. “The gathering of thousands of government officials, activists, scientists, and journalists is an opportunity to show that we are in an emergency, and we are going to try to mobilize people around this,” she says. In an interview conducted by NBC News, Reuters and The Nation, the activist complains that youth climate activists “are not being taken seriously” by world leaders. “They are just saying -- ‘We listen to you’, and then they applaud us, and then they go on just like before.” In Thunberg’s opinion, what is needed to make COP26 a success is unflinching honesty about the gap between what the countries are saying and what they are actually doing. “That’s not what we are doing now. We are trying to find concrete, small solutions that are symbolic in order to make it seem like we are doing something, without actually confronting the problem at all. We are still not counting all the emissions when we are announcing targets. We are still using creative accounting when it comes to emissions cuts, and so on. As long as that’s the case, we will not get very far,” she says. The climate activist endorsed the many lawsuits demanding compensation from fossil fuel companies for their decades of lying about climate change and the resulting damage and suffering, especially in frontline communities. “I think that these people need to be held accountable for all the damage that they have caused, especially for the people whose communities and whose health and livelihoods have been devastated by the actions of these companies,” she said, adding that it’s the bare minimum to ask for. Thunberg is “open” to meeting with United States President Joe Biden at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, though she does not expect much from either the US leader or the summit that runs from October 31 to November 12. The notion of meeting with the president of the world’s other climate change superpower, Xi Jinping of China, seemed even more distant to Thunberg than a meeting with Biden. Calling Xi “a leader of a dictatorship,” she nevertheless did not rule out the idea. She stressed, however, that “democracy is the only solution to the climate crisis, since the only thing that could get us out of this situation is massive public pressure.” The fact that world leaders, by her own account, are not doing what she and millions of activists are demanding has not led her and other movement leaders to consider new strategies and tactics, at least not yet. “Right now, we are just repeating the same message, like a broken record,” she said. “And we are going out on the streets because you need to repeat the same message until people get it. I guess that's the only option that we have. If we find other ways of doing it in the future that work better, then maybe we will shift.” The torch-bearer for young activists across the globe emphasized that she sees “many, many bright spots” in the climate emergency, citing the millions of people around the world who are taking action. “When I’m taking action, I don’t feel like I am helpless and that things are hopeless, because then I feel like I’m doing everything I can,” she said. “And that gives me very much hope, especially to see all the other people all around the world, the activists, who are taking action and who are fighting for their present and for their future.” Asked where she sees herself, and humanity, 10 years from now, Greta said, “I have no idea. I think as long as I’m doing everything I can, as long as we are doing everything we can, we can just live in the moment and try to change the future while we still can, instead of trying to predict the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/world-leaders-not-taking-youth-climate-activists-seriously-says-greta/articleshow/86971897.cms||---

The ‘Back to School’ campaign will be held between October 18 and 23. All the arrangements should be made in schools by the end of the campaign. The fitness of the school buildings and vehicles should be ensured by October 25. School safety audit should be completed before October 30. This will be conducted by the educational officers with the support of the local bodies. Awareness campaigns and counselling will also be imparted to parents and students between October 25 and 31 regarding Covid protocols and bio bubbles to be followed. “The guidelines issued by the government have directed the constitution of health-monitoring committees in schools. These committees, with the help of health and social justice departments, will give counselling to the students and parents. School rapid response teams will be formed,” said an official. The meeting also discussed general guidelines issued by the government regarding the opening of schools. Motor vehicles department will hold an awareness class regarding Covid protocols before October 31 for schoolbus drivers, cleaners and drivers of other vehicles engaged in transporting students to schools. The cleaning campaign will be held with the support of all agencies available in the respective local body or at ward level. District collector will convene a meeting of all local body heads, secretaries and officials from various departments on Monday evening to discuss implementing the back to school campaign. A people’s support committee will also be formed for maintenance works of school buses belonging to government schools. The school advisory committee was formed to address the school safety issues with the district collector as its chairman and deputy director of education its convener. Meanwhile, a mental health programme in Ernakulam plans to give awareness to teachers on psycho-social issues of students when schools reopen. “The awareness will be conducted after assessing the situation once the schools reopen. We will give awareness to teachers on how to cope with students, who have been attending online classes for one-and-half years, mobile addiction of students and Covid fear,” said Soumya Raj, mental health programme officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/back-to-school-campaign-to-be-held-during-october-18-23-in-ernakulam/articleshow/86926267.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Take guard against rise in Covid cases in Kolkata, warn experts||KOLKATA: Experts have asked healthcare facilities to be ready for an increase in the number of Covid admissions towards the end of October. With a surge in pre-Puja crowds, swelling each day as the festival approaches, a spurt in the number of Covid cases is imminent by the end of this month in Kolkata, the experts feared. The plateauing of numbers and hospitalizations since early August resulted from a strict adherence to Covid protocol since the second wave. This adherence had started to wane, and the consequences of that could be evident in a fortnight, the experts warned. With the festival crowd set to peak during Puja this week, transmission, too, could be fast, though the number of affected people could be smaller than in the second wave, with most suffering mild infections, they predicted. A section of doctors, however, warned that if the number of affected people swelled, there could be a proportionate rise in the number of those with severe disease, a substantial number despite vaccination. “We have let our guard down,” said Raja Dhar, director of pulmonology, CMRI Hospital. “But the virus is still active and vaccination can’t prevent transmission. It can resist the disease and there will still be a handful, who could have severe infection despite inoculation. So, the next one month is going to be crucial.” He added that there were several Covid patients under his treatment now, including some who had severe disease despite double vaccination. “One was on ventilation, another has just come out of it but is still serious. So, a section will still have severe disease despite vaccination, which underlines the importance of social distancing, which has now been almost obliterated,” Dhar added. ‘Need to protect kids, who are yet to be vaccinated’Any overcrowding could lead to quick transmission, which is dangerous at this juncture when a third wave is apprehended, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar.  “Despite more than 95% of the Kolkata population being inoculated, transmissibility rate in the city remains more than 1, which means an individual can still transmit the disease to another. In a crowded scenario, this could lead to a spurt in numbers,” Sarkar said. He, however, felt that most cases would now be mild. “On the other hand, there will be an exchange of crowd between Kolkata and its outskirts, which is again dangerous and could lead to transmission. Above all, we need to protect our children, who remain unvaccinated and vulnerable,” said Sarkar. Sauren Panja, intensivist, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, pointed out that Kolkata was probably heading for a repeat of last year when, too, the number of Covid-affected had peaked in the last week of October. “The plateauing in number has led to complacence, which is evident in the crowds that we now see around us. I expect a surge between the middle and end of October, but it may not be a huge one. Probably, we will see a 30% rise in cases, which will take the number of daily affected in Bengal past the 1,000 mark,” Panja said. The number of daily affected in Bengal is now hovering around the 700+ mark, according to figures released by the government. A slow and imperceptible surge may have already begun, said Sarkar. “There has been a spurt in cough and cold cases, many of which could actually be Covid. But they are being mild due to vaccination, so hospitalizations are still rare. Many, though, are being detected with Covid while seeking admission for non-Covid treatment,” said Sarkar. Peerless Hospital has already seen a spike in Covid admissions. The number of patients is now 31, which is the highest since the second wave. We have never had more than 28 since June,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. He added that the hospital was getting ready to add a Covid ward. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and AMRI, too, have decided to increase Covid beds in view of Puja. “We have 47 Covid beds, of which 32 are occupied, with 16 critical-care patients. If we see a steady rise in cases, we will add more beds as we have the infrastructure ready. For non-Covid wards, though, we will return to the pre-pandemic roster for doctors and nurses,” said R Venkatesh, zonal head, RTIICS. At AMRI Hospitals, the number of Covid beds, which is now 50 across its three units, will go up to 75-80. “We will also have more doctors and nurses ready in case there is a sudden spurt in admissions during the Pujas,” said CEO Rupak Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/take-guard-against-rise-in-covid-cases-warn-experts/articleshow/86924229.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Water at 1,000 cusecs released from Poondi reservoir||CHENNAI: The storage level at Poondi reservoir touched 2,823 mcft and the PWD on Sunday released water at the rate of 1,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs). A senior PWD official told TOI that the maximum water level at Poondi reservoir is 35 ft, and on Sunday morning, it touched 34 ft. The release is owing to continuous inflow of water from two reservoirs in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The official said the contiguous areas of Ammapalli reservoir, which is near Nagari in AP, received continuous rains, forcing the AP government to release water. Apart from this, water from Kandaleru reservoir is also flowing through Krishna canal into Poondi reservoir. The PWD will continue the release water at the rate of 1,000 cusecs from Poondi till Monday. Depending upon the rainfall and inflow from the neighbouring state, there will be a decision on discharging more water, said the official. As of Sunday, the combined storage level of water in six reservoirs, including the Veeranam tank in Cuddalore district, was 10,849 mcft as against the full storage level of 13,222 mcft. With the storage levels in the six reservoirs very comfortable, the Metrowater is continuing to supply 983 million litres of water per day to its consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-water-at-1000-cusecs-released-from-poondi-reservoir/articleshow/86926425.cms||P Oppili
---||Bhopal||MP power plants have burnt 88,000 MT extra coal during shortage scare||BHOPAL: In times of coal crisis, thermal power stations of Madhya Pradesh are apparently consuming more coal than the ‘prescribed’ quantity for generating energy. Officials seek to explain that there has been deterioration in quality — or gross calorific value — of the coal that is supplied, which means more coal has to be used to produce the same amount of energy. Sources, however, point out that if, after the final billing for October, coal quality turns out to be same as it was supplied in the months till August (details of September are yet to be finalized), then a whopping 88,000 metric tonnes of coal, worth over Rs 30 crore, was consumed in excess between October 1 and October 9. ‘Above-average coal consumption can’t be quantified monetarily’In these 9 days, 4 lakh metric tonnes of coal was used up by the four stateowned thermal power stations — Satpura, Sri Singaji, Sanjay Gandhi and Amarkantak. With 5,229 lakh units of energy being produced in this period, an average 768 grams of coal was used to generate 1 unit of electricity. Ideally, this should have been 620 grams per unit, say sources. If seen individually, it’s Sri Singaji Thermal Power Station where per-unit coal consumption has been the highest at 817g per unit of electricity in these 9 days. Superintending engineer at Sri Singaji plant, A K Sharma said, “There are several technical reasons. First, quality of coal. When we get coal of gross calorific value of 3,500, we can generate 1 unit of electricity from around 600g of coal. Now, there is no choice regarding procurement of coal. Secondly, due to the unavailability of coal, we are not able to run the units at full capacity. This also increases consumption of fuel.” The above-average coal consumption cannot be quantified in monetary terms as the rate of coal is decided on its calorific value and grade, Sharma told TOI. “The calorific value is determined on the basis of sampling and tests done by a central government-appointed laboratory, which is acceptable to both the generators and mining companies,” he added. Despite repeated calls and messages, managing director of the MP Genco, Manjeet Singh, could not be contacted for comment on the issue. A senior official of the department said, “We are not in a condition to negotiate on quality due to the availability crisis. Besides, during this time of the year, we get coal mixed with water and soil. More importantly, we are not able to run the units at full capacity. Normally, we wouldn’t have procured the coal that is being supplied right now, but due to the present crisis we are not in a condition to insist on quality of coal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-power-plants-have-burnt-88000-mt-extra-coal-during-shortage-scare/articleshow/86926432.cms||Amarjeet Singh

This was slightly higher than the previous Sunday's figure of 17.1lakh. Almost half (11.02 lakh) those vaccinated were getting their second dose. Over 25 lakh people were due for their second dose by Sunday. J Radhakrishnan, health secretary, said infections had come down in districts with better vaccination coverage, particularly in the western region. On Sunday, more doses were allocated to districts that had a high second dose eligible population. So far, more than five crore (64 % of the state's population) people had got at least one dose. But the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have opined that at least 70% of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent infection spread even if a third wave commences, said health minister Ma Subramanian. In Chennai city, the civic body had set up two static and two mobile camps in each of the 200 wards. The latter were used to cover localities with floating populations and gated communities. Compared to the previous mass vaccination drives, health authorities said, fewer people were coming forward on their own. So health workers are going the extra mile to achieve the targets set by approaching people through local influencers. Mild showers in the afternoon too came as a spoiler, preventing people from venturing out of their homes for vaccination. In Madurai, Trichy and some other places, the local bodies continued to announce gifts to bring in more people to vaccine centres. Instead of conducting the mass vaccination on Sundays, a section of health officials batted for vaccination drives in adequate locations on weekdays at regular intervals by targeting the unvaccinated population and those waiting for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/22-5-lakh-get-covid-jab-across-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86926461.cms||---

While two victims succumbed to their injuries, four others have been hospitalised. Police have booked the accused and his father for murder, but have not made any arrest so far. The victims and the accused in the case are residents of the Hafed colony in Nilokheri. The family members of the deceased alleged that the accused, Aman, used to drive aggressively in the lane. On Sunday, when the locals objected to his overspeeding and went to his house to complain to his father, the latter refused to hear them. Meanwhile, Aman also reached the spot in his Ford Endeavour and joined his father in abusing them. Aman allegedly hit six of them with his vehicle and fled from the spot, they alleged. The victims were rushed to a hospital, where two of them succumbed to their injuries. The deceased have been identified as Raj Rani (42) and Subhash (55).

Compared to same time in the start of September the average number of cases have doubled. Around 20 cases were diagnosed in Bhopal in the first ten days of September. According to experts, the number of cases are being attributed to two factors. One is those getting diagnosed with COVID-19 are mostly not vaccinated. Second factor is increased migration and travel during the festive season. In Hamidia hospital, 90% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last two weeks were not vaccinated to protect against COVID-19 infection. “The situation is alarming to the extent that cases are increasing. Hospitalization numbers are very low. However, the situation is fluid and administration should take measures to penalize those who are not adhering to COVID-19 guidelines,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. Only about half of city’s population is vaccinated. With the opening up and loosening of restrictions the ideal environment for infection spurt exists, he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/40-new-covid-cases-reported-in-bhopal-in-oct/articleshow/86923261.cms||---
---||Chennai||Railways wants to shut down schools, shift students to Kendriya Vidyalayas||CHENNAI: The Railway Board has once again mooted a proposal to shut down schools run by zonal railways which don’t have a significant number of students on their rolls. Those schools with substantial number of students may be merged with Kendriya Vidyalayas, the board said. In a letter issued on September 28, Mahesh Kumar Meena, joint director (establishment) in Railway Board wrote to zonal railways to assess schools managed by them. This is in line with the board's instructions which stipulate that ‘efforts should be made to progressively close down existing railway schools matching the expansion of KVs and other nonrailway schools.’ Eventually, railway schools would be transferred to Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). This is being done to optimise the utilisation of resources spent on running schools, the letter stated. “A quota for children of railway employees might be given in KVs,” the letter stated. The letter has asked zonal railways to identify railway schools which can be handed over to KVs and also close down schools where the enrolment is small and where it is not feasible to merge it with another institution. Southern Railway runs seven schools (six of which are in Tamil Nadu), which has a total enrolment of 2627. Amount allotted to them is around Rs 20 lakh. These schools are in Perambur, Arakkonam, Madurai, Tiruchirapalli, Erode, Pothanur and Palakkad. M Suryaprakash, working general secretary of Southern Railway Employees Sangh (SRES), which is one of the unions representing employee issues, said that this was a move keeping in line with the Union government’s plan to privatise railways. “Facilities like schools and hospitals were created by Railways for the benefit of its vast number of employees. It is the government’s responsibility to maintain and upgrade them, instead of shutting it down. Railway schools can offer some special railway related subjects that can help students prepare for a career in the organisation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/railways-wants-to-shut-down-schools-shift-students-to-kendriya-vidyalayas/articleshow/86926509.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh: Switch To Horticulture Is Bearing Fruit||SHAHPUR (KANGRA): Although only 8% of the land in Himachal Pradesh is under horticulture crops, of late farmers are being hand held and schooled on switching to horticultural crops, as the benfits overweigh the challenges. For instance, according to horticulture officer Sanjeev Katoch, HP’s horticulture department is running a state-sponsored scheme, Himchal Pradesh Kiwi Protsahan Yojana, under which farmers are given 50% subsidy — Rs 6,93,000 per hectare — on pro rata basis for planting material, field preparation, trellis system and installation of micro-irrigation system. The biggest challenge though is the wait — farmers are expected to wait for two to three years before they can harvest their hard work. “Although lucrative, many farmers do not want to go this route as it means they have to wait for two to three years. But, if they are patient, they earn 10-year income from traditional crops in a single year,” said Parwinder Thakur of Lanjot village in Kangra, who has taken up kiwi farming for the first time in 2020 and is still waiting for the crop to mature. The big apple gameNow that varieties of apple that are ideal for mid-hill climatic conditions of Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh are giving a good yield, even farmers from the adjoining Punjab are being tempted to grow apples in the plains of Punjab. A former oil rig worker Puran Chand alias Abhinav returned to his native but remote village Durgella in Kangra district of Himachal to continue with the traditional farming that had over the years remained unchanged. But Abhinav found it difficult to sustain himself with the meager earnings from wheat cultivation on his small land holding and ventured in smalltime transport business. Menawhile, being a farmer to the core, he decided to diversify into horticulture and planted apple trees. Now, the same land that used to earn him around Rs 3,000 per kanal a year is now fetching him over Rs 40,000 per annum. “I used to grow wheat on three kanal land, which used to give me around Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per annum. I used to grow some vegetables too, which were consumed by us. This year though I sold apples worth Rs 1.25 lakh grown on three kanal land and next year I expect the sales to increase to more than Rs 2 lakh, as the yield will also increase,” said Abhinav who earlier worked in Bombay High oil rig. In 2018, Abhinav planted 30 low-chill varieties of apple plants that could grow and bear fruits in up to 45 degrees Celsius temperature and within a year he got a sample yield, a part of which he sold and the rest was consumed by the family or gifted to friends. “I was encouraged with the yield and decided on the commercial cultivation of apples and planted another 120 apple plants. This year, I sold apples for over Rs 1.25 lakh,” he said adding that he didn’t use chemical fertilisers or pesticides. The use organic manure and pest control methods naturally meant he could market his apples as chemical free for higher prices.“I sold my apples for Rs 100, Rs 150 and Rs 200 per kg depending upon their size and quality,” he said adding that the harvesting lasted till July 15. He also said as his apples were of good quality, he soon benefitted from word of mouth recommendations, which eventually meant he did not have to go to markets, customers came to him. Abhinav and his wife Madhu Bala together work in the fields and have divided the working hours and respective farm duties. Madhu said the apple seedlings were procured from Kashmir.which was then grafted by them. “We have got queries from other farmers, even many from Punjab, who wish to diversify from traditional crops,” she said, adding that they had also begun their own nursery where they make available 30,000 low chill varities of apples, including Anna, Dorset and Michael. She said they had supplied apple plants to the farmers from Karnatka, and Uttar Pradesh, too. “We are getting a lot of queries for apple cultivation from farmers of Pathankot in Punjab,” she said. Subject matter specialist (SMS) with the horticulture department, Kangra, Sanjay Gupta said the low-chill varieties of apples are ready for harvest in the first week of June. “The advantage is that, at this time no apple is available for harvesting in main apple-growing areas,” he said. According to him, that the varieties are also almost disease free. The farmers who had got their apple crop last year were able to sell it for up to Rs 200 per kilo as farmgate price, said he. So far 26 farmers of the Rait block had taken high-density apple cultivation covering an area of 4.12 hectares in which 3,888 plants were accomodated, he added. Kiwi farming in low hill areasCan kiwi cultivation in lower hill areas of Himachal be the game changer? Going by the claims of Parwinder Thakur, a businessman of Lanjot village of Kangra district, who has ventured into kiwi cultivation, it could be profitable than traditional crops. He said he is expecting to sell his kiwi crop, cultivated in one acre land, for over Rs 10 lakh. “I have planted 160 kiwi plants in one acre land and according to the experts, I should be getting a yield of around 50kg of high-grade kiwi fruits from each plant, which comes to a total yield of around 8,000kg. Each kg is expected to be sold for at least Rs 125, which means I could earn Rs 10 lakh. Lower grade of kiwis can be used for making jams,” said Parwinder. He said he had planted 160 plants of kiwi in 2020 and the first crop will be available by October or November next year. According to him, there is an immense demand for kiwi fruits, which are sold per piece in Himachal, Punjab, Chandigarh and Delhi. Kangra horticulture department’s Sanjay said kiwi plants are ideally planted from the end of December to January and around 400 plants are accommodated in one hectare of land. According to him, so far 12 farmers had taken up kiwi plantation covering 2.62 hectares of land and 1,048 saplings were planted. He said one vine of kiwi can produce up to one quintal of fruit when fully matured. He is also confident that kiwi plantation is likely to increase The ‘dalchini’ dealRealising that people in India have been consuming inferior quality cinnamon (dalchini) having serious ill effects on health, The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT) has, for the first time, begun organised cultivation of ‘true’ variety of cinnamon plant in the country. Dr Sanjay Kumar, director, CSIR-IHBT told TOI, “The true cinnamon is derived from cinnamomum verum whereas the majority of cinnamon being sold in the market is derived from cinnamomum cassia, which has a high content of courmarin, which is not good for kidneys, due to which it is banned in the United States and some other countries.” Dr Kumar said cinnamomum verum is mainly grown in Sri Lanka, while it is grown in small quantities in countries like Seychelles, Madagascar, and India. India imports 45,318 tonne (at an estimated cost of Rs 909 crore) of cinnamon annually from China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Nepal. Of the 45,318 tonne of imports, astonishingly, India imports 37,166 tonnes of cinnamomum cassia (species banned in several countries) from Vietnam, China, and Indonesia. “Realising that the large import of cinnamon in the country is of Cinnamomum cassia and not Cinnamomum verum we had the ecological niche modelling of cinnamomum verum and identified its potential areas for cultivation in Himachal. Our data suggested that the districts of Una, Bilaspur, Kangra, Hamirpur and Sirmour have potential areas for its cultivation,” said the director. With the cultivation of cinnamomum verum, Himachal has become the first state of India to have organised cultivation of cinnamon . Kumar said 2,000 hectares of the area is under cinnamomum verum cultivation in Kerala, but is is being done in an unorganised manner. “In recent past, the agriculture minister Virender Kanwar launched the pilot project on cinnamon cultivation in the state by planting its saplings in the field of a progressive farmer Yograj at villae Kholin in Una district,” said he. adding that initially, they plan to plant as many as 600 to 700 plants of true dalchini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/switch-from-traditional-to-horticultural-crops-is-finally-bearing-fruit-for-hp-farmers/articleshow/86922220.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chennai||Man calls cops before he burns to death in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Several residents of a village in Tiruvallur district on Saturday morning saw a man, his body enveloped in fire, screaming and running across a riverbed and alerted police. What the villagers didn’t know was that a few minutes earlier the man had called up some of his relatives claiming six men had set him ablaze. While the man, identified as L Gopinathan of Nallur, died in the wee hours of Sunday at the government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) in Chennai, police suspect it to be a case of suicide as he had been seen buying petrol at a fuel station in the locality. Around 11am on Saturday, a police officer said, Gopinathan, a pump set operator, shocked residents as he hurtled ascross a riverbed in Nallur, wreathed in flames, shouting that six men had set him on fire. The villagers doused the fire and rushed him to Ponneri government hospital from where he was shifted to KMCH where he died early on Sunday. The Minjur police, who registered a case of suspicious death, began inquiries to help ascertain the identity of the gang members and also began scanning footage from CCTV cameras in the village. One showed Gopinathan on his bike filling petrol for the vehicle and also filling a bottle before heading for home. Soon, investigations revealed that he was unmarried, but had been in separate relationships with two married women. “Whenever his family members asked him to get married, he ignored their advice and kept dodging them,” said a police officer. He had also told his friends that he was facing problems from the women he had affairs with. “A detailed probe is on to find out the cause of death,” the officer said. Several of Gopinathan’s neighbours told police that they had not noticed the movement of any strangers in the locality. Police said they are also not ignoring his version and were trying to find out if there was any previous enmity between Gopinathan and any gang. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of suicide, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-calls-cops-before-he-burns-to-death-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86926556.cms||---

---||Business||Building blocks put in place for economy’s take-off||NEW DELHI: In late April and early May 2020, amid the national lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a series of meetings with experts across several sectors and officers, where he sought to get a sense of the issues facing these segments of the economy and the way ahead. “The message was clear, there is political commitment to convert the Covid crisis into an opportunity by resetting policies so that we can achieve higher levels of growth when things begin to normalise. It was a signal to the bureaucracy to move decisively,” a senior official privy to some of the discussions told TOI. What followed were a series of measures, announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after consulting the ministries concerned — from pushing new labour and farm laws to the public sector policy, which focuses on privatisation of non-core assets, to changes in the MSME definition, corporatisation of ordnance factories and the rollout of production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes of nearly Rs 2 lakh crore across sectors. Between all this, there were also some measures, which were not part of the original scheme of things as the government decided to reverse the controversial retrospective amendments of tax laws and rework the policy framework for mobile companies to reduce their financial stress — moves that not just took investors by surprise but also helped them shed some pessimism on India. “Several of these issues, such as the labour and farm law changes or the Air India disinvestment, have been dragging on for decades,” said a source in the government. Officials believe that the results are now showing, as they point to the recent upgrade in the outlook for India’s sovereign rating to stable, from negative. “While it may have taken a little longer but the whole message to investors is very positive. All these help generate excitement and more and more funds will look to invest in India, which can be strengthened by retail investors from some of the countries joining in too,” said a senior executive at a leading financial services company. The only stumbling block could be the high valuation of Indian shares, he warned. For the government — which was until a few months ago accused of having lost its appetite for reforms, a charge they never pleaded guilty to and which they have consistently attributed to conservative definition of what constitutes “reforms” and bias — this is clearly the outcome that it had hoped for. Several commentators and critics had argued the Modi government had given up on undertaking initiatives to boost economic activity and was more focused on issues such Ram Mandir and revoking Article 370. After the seemingly impossible task to sell off AI, officials who dismiss the notion — gleefully pointing to the recent record — argue how the government was working towards this all along. The message is not lost on investors as companies, earlier dependent only on China, are looking to recalibrate production strategies. Officials point to Apple vendors, who were lured to set up a manufacturing base in India, or white goods players such as Panasonic or Daikin that have queued up at the PLI window. With more privatisation transactions in the pipeline as well as large and still-growing interest from investors in the asset monetisation space, the government believes it is has put the building blocks in place for the economy to take off in the coming months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/building-blocks-put-in-place-for-ecos-take-off/articleshow/86926554.cms||Sidhartha

The thermal generation is supplementing just around 20 % of the total requirement due to the unseen crisis. The discoms are gearing up for sudden power outages due to the shortage in supplies from generation centres. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was the first to highlight the coal crisis in the thermal power stations in the country when he sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene last week. Many states woke up to the crisis after AP raised the alarm on severe shortage of coal stocks with the thermal generation centres. The coal stock yard in Narla Tata Rao Vijayawada Thermal Power Station has become almost empty on Sunday, prompting the authorities to shut down two generation units. The genco authorities are operating just five out of seven units in NTTPS generating around 950 mw against the installed capacity of 1760 mw. The authorities are gripped with tension as they were waiting for the arrival of the coal wagons to continue the operations in running plants. At least 21,000 tonnes of coal is required to operate all the seven units. However, the coal stocks were completely exhausted as the officials were operating the units by depending on the arrival of coal stocks on daily basis. “We have been operating the plants with low stocks for the past 3-4 weeks,” said a senior official of the NTTPS. Consumers urged to be cautious in power use  “We are literally on our toes as it would take four to five days to bring the unit into operation once it is shut down,” the official added. Meanwhile, Central Power Distribution Company Limited (CPDCL) issued cautionary note to power consumers to maintain self-restrain in using power gadgets. The CPDCL urged the consumers to be judicious in using power utilities keeping in view the dipping generation from thermal plants. All the thermal power plants put together are producing just around 40 million units against the state’s total consumption of 190 million units. “All the thermal plants including Narla Tata Rao Vijayawada Thermal Power Station (VTPS) and Rayalaseema Thermal Power Station (RTPS) were left with just a day’s buffer stock resulting in shut down of the plants in a phased manner,” said principal secretary (energy) and AP transco CMD Dr N Srikanth. “The situation is complicated due to several reasons including shortage in coal production due to heavy rains, high prices for the coal in the internal market and sudden spike in the consumption,” said Dr Srikanth. He appealed to people to switch of air-conditioners at least between 6 pm and 10 pm to reduce the load. The power demand has jumped to 190 million units in October, 2021 against 160mu in 2019. The output in factories and consumption in commercial establishments reached its peak following the ease in the Covid-19 situation. The Union energy ministry assured states of adequate stocks of coal in 2-3 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-stares-at-severe-power-crisis-due-to-shortage-of-coal-stocks-at-power-plants/articleshow/86925005.cms||Samdani MN

---||Business||Women workers go on strike at Urban Co||NEW DELHI: A section of women workers comprising beauticians and salon experts at online gig marketplace Urban Company has gone on strike, alleging exploitation by newly minted Unicorn. Low wages, inadequate working conditions for women employees and high commissions charged by the on-demand home services provider were some of the reasons cited by these workers for the ongoing strike. The development, which comes against the backdrop of similar protests at food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato, forced the Tiger Global-backed company to publicly come out in support of its wage structure on Sunday. Urban Company has around 35,000 workers on its platform. “Urban Company partners earn a net average Rs 280-300 per hour, net of commissions, fee and all associated product and travel costs. The top quartile of service partners earn more than Rs 36,000 per month net of all commissions, fees, travel and product costs,” Urban Company said in a statement. When asked about unavailability of insurance cover to workers on its platform, as alleged by the striking workers, the company said, “All Urban Company service partners have access to life and accidental insurance cover…several partners also enjoy free health insurance through the platform.” “During the pandemic, we approved Rs 100 million worth of interest-free loans for all our beauty partners in locked-down regions. Our estimates suggest that in the offline world, service professionals earn on average between Rs 12,000-15,000 per month,” it added. In August, Swiggy and Zomato, too, faced a backlash on social media, when a a few delivery partners raised similar issues, citing exploitation. High commissions coupled with lack of compensation for soaring petrol prices and slashed fees due to the pandemic were some of the allegations levelled at the companies. While the protests followed massive fund raises by these companies — Urban Company, too, raised $255 million in June — they denied all charges of exploitation. While Zomato claimed that the average amount it pays to delivery partners had increased by 20% over last year based on variable components, Swiggy said it introduced a permanent petrol component for delivery partners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/women-workers-go-on-strike-at-urban-co/articleshow/86926621.cms||John Sarkar

The move by Dream11, which counts Falcon Edge and Tiger Global among its backers, comes close on the heels of similar steps taken by other online fantasy sports or gaming platforms, including MPL and RummyCircle. The gaming company showed a message that users that reside in Karnataka or hold bank accounts within the state cannot participate in cash contests on the platform. When contacted, a Dream11 spokesperson said it ceased operations due to its Karnataka users expressing deep concerns and anxiety. “In order to allay our users’ concerns, we have decided to suspend operations in Karnataka. This decision is without prejudice to our rights and contentions under law,” the Dream11 spokesperson said. “The Karnataka Police Act recently amended its gaming law to prohibit online gambling, betting and wagering.” “We have been advised by the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports, who have shared an opinion from a former Supreme Court judge, stating that the Act does not apply to its member fantasy sports operators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dream11-halts-operations-in-karnataka-after-cops-file-fir/articleshow/86926644.cms||---

There is a significant focus on securing coal blocks and supplies because of concerns over existing stocks. Three major thermal power stations in the state have reserves that are expected to last for 48 hours, officials said. The central government has allotted Karnataka a coal block near Chandrapur in Maharashtra and another one in Mahanadi, Odisha. Bommai has requested Union minister for environment and forest Bhupender Yadav to give the required approvals at the earliest. “The two blocks allotted to Karnataka need certain clearances. For instance, the Chandrapur coal field needs a letter from the PCCF [principal chief conservator of forest] of Maharashtra. As I spoke to him yesterday, the Union minister assured me that the clearance would be given soon. I hope it will be done in a week,” he said. On the status of the Mahanadi coal block, Bommai said that the mine already had required permissions and was currently being managed by someone else. “We have convinced Yadav that we need not get fresh clearances for this block. He assured me that he would see the file and do the needful,” Bommai added. The CM has discussed the issues with Yadav as well as Union minister of coal and mines Pralhad Joshi. Bommai said that the inclusion of the two blocks would make Karnataka more self-reliant in terms of coal supply. The primary objective is to secure the Chandrapur coal block as the available rail link will reduce transportation costs substantially. “We have requested Joshi to allocate an additional two rakes [one rake is equal to 4,000 tonnes] and he has directed the officials concerned to do the needful,” he said. Running on fumes?According to officials, the Raichur and Ballari thermal power stations have stocks that will last for 48 hours. The situation is the same at the Yermarus power station. At the Raichur plant, only three out of the eight units have been functioning. At the Ballari station, only one of four units is functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-asks-centre-to-speed-up-approvals-for-coal-blocks/articleshow/86926685.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Delhi-Gurugram commute: Delayed by a year, Ambience Mall underpass to open this week||GURUGRAM: After missing several deadlines, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is likely to open the U-turn underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza near Ambience Mall on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway to the public this week. A longstanding demand of local residents, the 377-metre-long four-lane underpass will help commuters to avoid going to Rajokri in Delhi for taking a U-turn to reach Ambience Mall, DLF Cyber City and its adjoining areas. Currently, commuters have to travel an additional four kilometres to take the Rajokri U-turn, which during peak traffic hours can take an additional 45 minutes. The lengthy route also exacerbates traffic congestion at the Delhi-Gurugram border. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which began constructing the underpass in January 2019, had set an initial deadline of 18 months for completion of the project but officials said the work on the underpass was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a subsequent shortage of labour, repeated bans on construction due to high pollution levels, waterlogging due to heavy rainfall, and the delay in shifting toll gates and other utilities. On Sunday, an NHAI official told TOI, “Most of the work on the underpass has been completed and the remaining is being expedited. Only road carpeting is to be done, which is expected to be completed in the next few days. We hope to complete the construction by October 15.” Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, during a visit to Gurugram in September to inspect the construction of the Delhi-Mumbai expressway, had announced that the underpass would be opened by October 15 and “will provide relief to people in both Delhi and Haryana”. “The underpass is almost completely ready, only the wearing course remains to be completed in the box portion of the underpass. Apart from this, everything else, including signage and lights, has been completed,” another NHAI official said, adding that work to clean the underpass started Sunday. The underpass is being built at a cost of Rs 102.94 crore, with the expenditure being shared by NHAI (50%), Ambience (25%), and DLF (25%). The structure is a part of a larger project to decongest the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway. A second structure planned as a part of the project — a U-turn flyover at Shankar Chowk — was inaugurated in November last year. Ambience Island resident Partha Chatterjee said he had taken a house near the border to ensure that both Delhi and Gurugram would be easily accessible but crossing the border each day to commute to his office at Cyber City has now become a “nightmare”. “In fact, on many days I stay back in office until 9 pm just to avoid the traffic. This underpass will ease my life massively,” Chatterjee said. Netra Rai, a resident of Sector 54 says the underpass will not just cut travel time to the Ambience Mall and also make it easier for those looking to return home by cab. “As of now, it takes me around 30 minutes only to get a cab from the mall because the apps mostly pick up drivers who are on the carriageway heading towards Delhi who are unwilling to pay toll, travel all the way to Rajokri and then come to pick passengers,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/relief-on-horizon-for-delhi-ggn-commute-ambience-mall-underpass-to-open-this-week/articleshow/86922878.cms||Sakshi Dayal

---||Bengaluru||Dream11 suspends operations in Karnataka after FIR||BENGALURU: Dream11, an online fantasy sports platform, has suspended operations in Karnataka, following the amendment to Karnataka Police Act banning online betting and a case being registered against it. The company, backed by Tiger Global, thus becomes the next firm after Mobile Premier League (MPL) and Paytm First Games to ban its access in the state in less than a week. “We have been advised by the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS), who have shared an opinion from a former Supreme Court judge, stating that the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act 2021does not apply to its member fantasy sports operators. This is because the FIFS format of fantasy sports has been upheld by the hon’ble courts of India as not amounting to gambling, betting or wagering. However, following the recent media coverage, our Karnataka users have expressed concerns on their safety.To allay their concerns, we have decided to suspend operations in Karnataka,” Dream11 said in a statement. Police in Bengaluru booked the first case under the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act 2021 against founders of the company. The FIR was registered on Saturday by Annapoorneshwarinagar police based on a complaint filed by a 42-yearold cab driver Manjunatha, a resident of Nagarbhavi. The firm is accused of violating the law notified by the government on October 5. The move by the government came as a shocker, primarily because Karnataka has been the hotbed for online gaming activities, generating big revenue and also providing engineering talent for cuttingedge technology required to develop such games. The state has 100 gaming companies employing about 4,000 people. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) had said the bill may hurt Karnataka’s position as the country’s startup hub and lead to the loss of jobs and revenue for the state. India is currently home to over 430 million mobile gamers and the number of gamers is estimated to grow to 650 million by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dream11-suspends-operations-in-karnataka-after-fir/articleshow/86926749.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Vegetable prices shoot up in Bengaluru, traders blame it on rain||BENGALURU: Continuous downpour in neighbouring districts has pushed up prices of vegetables like onion, tomato and carrot in the city. Umesh Mirji, managing director, Hopcoms, Bengaluru, said tomato prices have been northbound for almost 10 days now. “Bengaluru receives its major tomato supplies from Kolar. There are two issues hurting the supplies, one being the rain spoiling the crop. The second is that in Kolar, tomato cultivation is more during monsoon and summer than the rabi season,” he said. Besides, tomatoes to Bengaluru come from Chitradurga and Andhra Pradesh too. Heavy rain in Andhra Pradesh has further affected the harvest and the supplies, he added. According to Hopcoms officials, the price of onion is also seeing a gradual increase. “Onion is Rs 47 per kg as of now. The supplies from Chitradurga, Chikkamagaluru and Dharwad are affected due to rain and the harvest is not of the desired quality,” Mirji said, adding that onion prices will most likely go up. Traders said vegetables that perish quickly have become dearer. Excess moisture is contributing to the rise in tomato and onion prices, they added. “Onion tends to develop a black fungus around its peel if it’s exposed to too much moisture. Tomatoes and carrots also go bad easily when exposed to moisture. It is the same with greens. They tend to perish easily with excess moisture hence their price always goes up during monsoon,” a trader explained. The wholesale price of tomato had gone up to Rs 1,000 to 1,200 per crate (22 kilos) but has now dropped to Rs 750 to Rs 800 per crate. “The increase in prices is just temporary; they will drop once the rain stops. It is a trend we have observed for years now,” the trader added. The retail price of tomato was Rs 65, onion Rs 50, and carrot Rs 75 on Sunday, up from Rs 10, Rs 25-30 and Rs 35-40, respectively, four weeks ago. RV Gopi, who represents the Wholesale Merchants Association, said: “The cost of only tomatoes seems to be very high in the wholesale market, which is also temporary. We expect onion prices to go up if the rain continues.” The cost of some vegetables may appear low in the wholesale market but their prices are high in the retail market as they are kept outside and exposed to moisture hugely, said another trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vegetable-prices-shoot-up-in-city-traders-blame-it-on-rain/articleshow/86920892.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Future of Taiwan lies in national reunification & wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots is linked to national rejuvenation,” Wang tweeted. “National reunification by peaceful means best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including our compatriots in Taiwan. We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.” The Chinese embassy statement was categorical that Beijing could resort to force if they wanted to. The official statement comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a similar statement reaffirming the “determination” to effect the reunification of Taiwan. Observers, however, noted that Xi appeared to have taken a softer tone in his remarks, by not referring to violence against Taiwan. Notwithstanding the statements, Chinese fighter aircraft have been relentlessly breaching Taiwan’s ADIZ (air defence identification zone) for the past week. Bonnie Glaser, Taiwan expert at the German Marshall Fund, was quoted in media reports as saying, “All of this diplomatic, military and economic coercion is really aimed at inducing this sense of psychological despair among the Taiwanese people that China is just so powerful that they just give up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/taiwans-independence-has-hit-dead-end-chinese-embassy-spokesman/articleshow/86926813.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Lightning strike kills man; rain leaves areas in most parts of Bengaluru flooded||BENGALURU: A 46-year-old vegetable vendor died after being struck by lightning on NICE Road near Magadi Road toll gate as incessant heavy rain lashed most parts of the city on Sunday. The downpour left BTM Layout and surrounding areas in south Bengaluru waterlogged. This is the second death in a week due to rain havoc. A hotelier was killed after ramming his scooter into an uprooted tree in the wee hours of October 4. Thippeswamy, a resident of T Dasarahalli and from Tumakuru, died at the spot, while his son Chidanand, 22, sustained injuries and was admitted to a nearby private hospital. Police said the incident took place around 5.45pm when the duo was returning home after attending a feast at a relative’s place in Chikkagollarahatti. They were astride their scooter and stopped near a tree to take shelter from the rain. Constables Manjunath and Nagaraju in a Hoysala vehicle moving on the stretch noticed two men lying on the ground. They reached the spot and found that Thippeswamy had died and Chidanand was alive. They rushed him to hospital, where he told police about the incident. Elsewhere in the city, Bannerghatta Main Road, Indiranagar 100 Ft Road, Koramangala 80 Ft Road, Palace Road and Jayamahal Road reported severe waterlogging, which hampered vehicle movement. Naveen Reddy, a resident of BTM Layout, said, “I have lived here for nearly 20 years and this has been the narrative for 10 years now. We informed BWSSB about this issue and they tried laying larger pipes to resolve it. But after a couple of showers, the problem was back.” Several cars were stranded on the waterlogged streets of the area. Naveen said he had to stop parking his car on the street as he was worried about the damage waterlogging could cause to it. “Every time a car gets inundated, the engine has to be desilted and it has to be completely dried before being used,” he added. The residents claim BWSSB said all the water flows on to their street when it rains and there is nothing that can be done about it. Commuters on two-wheelers were seen struggling to get through parts of a road in BTM Layout that had nearly one feet water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lightning-strike-kills-man-rain-leaves-areas-flooded/articleshow/86920924.cms||---

The quiz is designed based on the learning outcomes of Class IX and X lessons. A quiz is conducted for 90 minutes and students have to attend 10 objective type questions from each of the five subjects at a hi-tech lab in high and higher secondary schools. After each quiz, the department sends questions with correct answers for classroom discussions. "The questions will not be directly from textbooks and the performance will not be counted for any evaluation. The main purpose is to initiate classroom discussions as these children were away from schools for a long time," an official from the school education department said. The department is planning to conduct eight quizzes, and so far, four have been completed. However, teachers said students are finding it difficult to answer the questions as a majority of the questions are from outside the textbooks. "It's a good move, however, the internet speed in hitech labs is very slow and many students could not submit their responses due to poor net connection. The state government should provide high speed internet connectivity to government schools on priority basis," said A Peter Raja, president, Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Headmasters' Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-conducts-weekly-online-quiz-to-engage-class-x-students-in-classroom-discussions/articleshow/86926873.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Elderly patients develop more antibodies than younger ones, finds study||CHANDIGARH: Elderly patients aged above 60 have been found with more antibodies after recovering from Covid-19 than the younger ones in Punjab, according to research done by a joint team of doctors from the Adesh Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Bathinda, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The research found a strong correlation between the level of antibodies and age. Other factors such as the severity of disease, hospitalisation or need for oxygen or mechanical ventilation led to a rise in antibody levels but were not statistically significant. Higher antibodies noted in male participantsAs the association between clinical characteristics of the infection and formation of neutralising antibodies has not been well analysed, the prospective study was conducted to examine the correlation of various factors such as age, gender, the severity of disease and associated comorbidities with antibody response in recovered patients. A total of 92 patients were recruited at Adesh Institute of Medical Sciences and Research on an outpatient basis from August 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, between five and eight weeks post-onset of Covid symptoms. Of the total participants, 37% were above the age group of 60 while 44.6% were in the age bracket of 36-60 and the remaining were below 35. A majority of them suffered from mild infections (51.1%) while a significant number had moderate to severe infections (48.9%) and required hospitalisation. About 46% of patients required oxygen therapy during their stay and 19.6% required high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Except for one participant, all developed antibodies. The patient, who failed to develop antibodies, was diagnosed case of Granulomatosis polyangiitis (GPA) — a condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels — and was receiving rituximab maintenance therapy. The median antibody titres were 61AU/ml in the range of 1-135. On comparing the antibody levels among the different age groups, older age was associated with statistically significant higher antibody response. The age group of 60 and above had statistically significant higher antibody titres when compared to the below 35 age group. The level of antibody in patients aged above 60 was recorded at 71 AU/ml while the younger patients in the age group of below 35 had 28 AU/ml and 53 AU/ml in the age group between 35 and 60. Higher antibody titres of 66.5 AU/ml were noted in male participants against 55.5 AU/ml in female patients. The highest antibody titre of 135 AU/ml of the study was found in patients recovered from mild infection. The average antibodes among severe patients was 67AU/ml against 59 AU/ml in moderate patients and 54 AU/ml in patients who had a mild infection. The study titled ‘Heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 IgG response titre in patients recovered from Covid-19’ has been conducted by Dr Avneet Garg, Dr Rakendra Singh, Dr Mansimranjit Kaur, Dr Surbhi, Dr Ashish Jindal, Dr Saranpal Singh, Dr Avtar Singh Bansal and Dr Vinita Jindal of Adesh Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and Dr Hariharan Iyer and Dr Hem C Sati of AIIMS, Delhi. The findings have been published in the international scientific journal Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease. “The strengths of the current study are an in-depth analysis of the association of various demographical, clinical and radiological parameters and antibody titres which have helped to partly elucidate the pattern of immunological response,” said Dr Vinita Jindal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-19-elderly-patients-develop-more-antibodies-than-younger-ones/articleshow/86926700.cms||Vinod Kumar

The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial post but the president has the right to choose what political leader can try to form the next government. Earlier on Sunday, Zeman met with Babis, his close ally. On Saturday, the centrist ANO (Yes) party led by Babis, a populist billionaire, narrowly lost the Czech Republic’s parliamentary election. A liberal-conservative three-party coalition named Together captured 27.8% of the vote. The winning coalition got a majority of 108 seats in the 200-seat House, and they pledged to work together. Zeman indicated he would first appoint the leader of the strongest party, not the strongest coalition, to try to form the government, which would be Babis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/czech-president-in-hospital-new-government-may-be-delayed/articleshow/86926887.cms||---

They will be affiliated to Ryotu Bharosa Kendras. State government will also set up 175 high tech hubs in each of the assembly constituency. This programme will be implemented under YSR Farm Mechanisation Service Scheme. There will also be 11,035 cluster-level combined harvester community hiring centres in East and West Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has decided to provide modern agriculture facilities without additional investment, management burden to small and marginal farmers through the scheme. As part of the scheme, the state government will provide subsidy on hiring of agricultural machinery. At the level of Rythu Bharosa Kendras, the government provides community hiring centres by setting up a farmer group of at least five members with 40 per cent subsidy, 50 per cent bank loan and 10 per cent farmer group share. While the farmers in the groups use the equipment for their own cultivation, it also allows them to rent them out to other farmers on non-working days and thus generate additional income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/10750-hiring-centres-to-boost-agriculture/articleshow/86919593.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||Driving on wrong side becoming a norm on parts of NH-9 & Delhi-Meerut Expressway||GHAZIABAD: The familiar evil of wrong-side driving is fast becoming the bane of the NHAI’s showpiece 14-lane highway. From stray transgressions and a spot or two that were especially prone to it, wrong-side driving has become a habit in the section of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) and NH-9 around the Ghazipur-UP Gate border. Cars, autos, two-wheelers, even cyclists, form a steady stream that moves against the flow of traffic to enter Delhi through lanes meant for outbound traffic from the capital. This has made the NH-9 flyover at Ghazipur particularly dangerous to drive on and prone to accidents. The access-controlled central lanes of the highway – which is the DME – is not immune from this either. Bikes and autos get into the DME via the first Indirapuram exit for outbound Delhi traffic and drive down the wrong side in the direction of Akshardham and Mayur Vihar (these vehicle also now have access to Anand Vihar through the entry lane into the DME that has been created for Delhi-bound traffic because of diversions due to the farmers’ blockade of UP Gate). Wrong-side driving has been a problem in other parts of the DME as well. Last month, after an accident on the expressway near Dasna in which five members of a family were killed as a truck on the wrong side collided into their car, NHAI had stationed guards at some spots to stop vehicles from taking illegal turns. But that hasn’t really helped. “The NHAI had decided that guards would be stationed at spots where wrong-side driving is common,” NHAI project director Mudit Garg told TOI. “But within days of deploying the guards, they were asked to leave by Delhi Police near Ghazipur. They were told it was not their job,” Garg added. Delhi Police, however, did not respond to this. Garg also said many people were taking the wrong side to avoid detours because “because one side of the DME is shut for months now for the farmers’ protest”. Asked about wrong-side driving that is rampant on other stretches not affected by the blockade, like near Noida Sector 62, Chhijarsi and Dasna, Garg said: “The NHAI has done everything it could to stop jaywalking and wrong-side driving on the expressway. It has installed barriers and tried deploying guards. Ultimately, it is the traffic department that should ensure that violations of any kind, including wrong-side driving, don’t take place. The NHAI can only provide assistance.” Between Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate, four spots (Akshardham, Mayur Vihar, Ghazipur chicken market and MCD toll plaza) have been identified by the NHAI as prone to wrong-side driving. On the UP Gate-Dasna stretch of DME, four spots (CISF intersection, Model Town, Bamheta and Dasna intersection) were identified and on the Dasna-Meerut section, it was Dasna junction, Bhojpur and Partapur. Ghaziabad SP (traffic) Ramanand Kushwaha said wrong-side driving had two aspects to it – deliberate and inadvertent – and proper signage could stop the latter. “There are many people who get confused because of the lack of signage or the design of the expressway. During peak hours, we ensure that there is heavy police presence at the vulnerable spots on DME. But we need to penalise traffic rule violators,” he added. The DME and NH-9 form the 14-lane corridor between the capital and Meerut that the NHAI developed, upgrading the erstwhile four-lane NH-24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/driving-on-wrong-side-becoming-a-norm-on-parts-of-nh-9-dme/articleshow/86921692.cms||Abhijay Jha

The real estate act came into force in Tamil Nadu in 2017. In an order relating to a housing project that was to be completed before the Act was passed, adjudicating officer G Saravanan said the realty regulator gets jurisdiction over all the real estate projects eligible for registration under Section 3 of the RERA Act. “If the cause of action survives after coming into force of the RERA Act, TNRERA gets jurisdiction over all the disputes pertaining to the real estate projects,” the order said. The complaint pertains to a housing project titled ‘Temple Waves’ at Kundrathur in the city suburbs, promoted by Amar Prakash Developers Pvt. Ltd. Two homebuyers have paid nearly ?40 lakh each for apartments in the project which had an initial deadline of November 2015. One of the complainants charged that the developer failed to handover the apartment by the date. The developer then assured to complete the project in 2017 and invited them for a final inspection in 2018. According to the complainant, many deficiencies were found in the apartments allotted to them and the defects were not rectified. The developer failed to handover possession of the flats and the complainants, who availed housing loans, sought refund of the paid amount. The developer denied all the allegations, saying the construction of Block ‘D’, in which the said apartments were allotted to the complainants, was completed and completion certificate was received in 2016. Pointing out that TNRERA does not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaints, the promoter further charged that the complainants failed to adhere to the payment schedule as agreed by them. The timeframe stipulated in the agreement shall not be insisted or pressed into service by the complainants if there has been delay or default with respect to payment of dues as agreed by them, its representative argued. Hearing both sides, TNRERA directed the developer to repay their payments made by each of the homebuyers with a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to each of them for causing mental agony and hardships to the complainants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tnrera-to-handle-disputes-over-projects-built-before-2016-act/articleshow/86926969.cms||---
---||World||Iraqis vote in parliamentary polls; low turnout reflects loss of faith||BAGHDAD: Iraq’s parliamentary polls on Sunday drew one of the smallest turnouts for years, electoral officials indicated, with the low participation suggesting dwindling trust in political leaders and the democratic system brought in by the 2003 US-led invasion. The established, Shia Islamist-dominated ruling elite whose powerful parties have armed wings is expected to sweep the vote, with the movement led by populist Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who opposes foreign interference and whose rivals are Iran-allied Shia groups, seen emerging as parliament’s biggest faction. Such a result would not dramatically alter the balance of power in Iraq or the wider West Asia, say Iraqi officials, foreign diplomats and analysts, but for Iraqis it could mean that a former insurgency leader and conservative Islamist could increase his sway over the government. Two electoral commission officials said nationwide turnout was 19% by midday. Total turnout was 44.5% in the last election in 2018. Polling booths closed at 6pm (08.30pm IST) Initial results are expected on Monday but final turnout figures could be announced late on Sunday. However, Iraqi polls are often followed by protracted talks over a president, a PM and a cabinet. It appeared to be the lowest turnout in any election since 2003, according to electoral commission counts at polling stations. In Baghdad’s Sadr City, a polling station set up in a girls’ school saw a slow but steady trickle of voters. Election volunteer Hamid Majid, 24, said he had voted for his old school teacher, a candidate for the Sadrists. “She educated many of us in the area so all the young people are voting for her. It’s the time for the Sadrist Movement,” he said. The election was held several months early under a new law designed to help independent candidates — a response to widespread anti-government protests two years ago. “Jockeying and government formation will look the same — the same parties will come to either share power and not provide the population with basic services and jobs and on top of that will continue to silence dissent. It’s concerning,” said Renad Mansour of the Iraq Initiative at Chatham House think tank. School teacher Abdul Ameer Hassan al-Saadi said he boycotted the election, the first polls since mass protests over corruption, unemployment and poor services erupted in 2019. “My 17-year-old son got killed by a tear gas canister fired by police,” said al-Saadi. “I will not vote for killers and corrupt politicians.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iraqis-vote-in-parliamentary-polls-low-turnout-reflects-loss-of-faith/articleshow/86926993.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Green nod for industries to be valid for 5 to 14 years||CHENNAI: In a move welcomed by the business community, the state government on Sunday announced that the pollution control board would now issue consent to operate (CTO) certificates for periods between five to 14 years for various categories of industries, instead of insisting on annual or biennial renewals. So far, CTO certificates were issued for one year for red category industries and for two years each for orange and green category industries. Under the new system, the red category industries will get certificates valid for five years, orange category industries will get them for 10 years, and green category industries for 14 years. The CTO should be issued to an industry within 45 days from the date of application. But, it takes up to three months now. PCB officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the board’s other work got affected because of the annual exercise of renewing certificates and monitoring red and orange category industries. Hence, the decision to extend the validity of the certificates. Welcoming the announcement, Israr Ahmed, chairman, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said: “This is a very good move by the state government, as the form of yearly renewal is outdated. Every renewal has been made online now.” The new announcement will help the industry to do business without any difficulty. It also will reduce the cost of doing business and it's hassle-free too, he said. Ravi Reddy, proprietor of a hatchery, which falls under the orange category, said earlier the preparatory work to renew a certificate once in two years had to be started three months before its expiry. The new system will help in saving time for the entrepreneurs. The state government had announced an industry-friendly step, which will be welcomed by all, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-green-nod-for-industries-to-be-valid-for-5-to-14-years/articleshow/86927033.cms||P Oppili
