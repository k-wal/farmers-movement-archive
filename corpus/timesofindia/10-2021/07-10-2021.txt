In one of the clearest enunciations of the US policy to China, Sherman told journalists they would compete, challenge and cooperate with the Asian country in various fields. “We have a very complex relationship with China. And it falls into three pathways. One, we know that China will be a major competitor with the US in economics, emerging tech and in the future. We are happy to compete with China, as long as there is a level playing field... Let's make sure that everybody's living by the rules of the road. The irony is, China has grown and developed because of that international rule-based order and now they want to change it.” “Secondly, we will challenge China where we must; we want to make sure there's a free open and interconnected Indo-Pacific, as does India. China doesn't get to decide who gets to use those waterways and who doesn't, what belongs to the international community, and what they claim belongs to them.” She also raked up Taiwan. “They have sent sorties of airplanes across Taiwan over the last couple of days, and we find that to be a very dangerous action.” Thirdly, Sherman said, the US will look for areas where “we can cooperate — like Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran”. “We have worked together on counter narcotics; we need to work together on counterterrorism and global health.” It is also clear that the Taliban government in Afghanistan will have to wait for international legitimacy. Sherman held discussions with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, and called on NSA Ajit Doval during the day. She also called on foreign minister S Jaishankar in the evening. While talking to journalists after her discussions with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, the visiting US deputy secretary of state said the Taliban “must create an inclusive government, ensure that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for terrorists, allow safe travel of people who wish to relocate, subscribe to human rights, including that of women, girls and minorities.” However, striking a discordant note on the possibility of CAATSA sanctions on India when the country takes delivery of S-400 system from Russia later this year, Sherman said the US has been “quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400”. “We think that is dangerous and not in anybody's security interest. That said, we have a strong partnership with India, we want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead.” Indian government sources said India had shared its own perspectives on both CAATSA and Afghanistan with Sherman. India believes no third country can exercise a veto on its sovereign decisions. However, India and the US are maintaining their intensive interactions. A counterterrorism JWG will be meeting from October 26-28, while a defence policy forum is meeting this weekend. The 2+2 meeting between foreign and defence ministers is scheduled for November, though no dates have been fixed yet. Sherman said the US and India were on the “same page” regarding Afghanistan and the demand for unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance. “We must help the Afghan people who are suffering terribly, many children are going without food, and certainly education and health care. And so we support humanitarian assistance that is operated through NGOs, or through UN organizations. We do not believe that now's the time to provide money directly to the Taliban or to the interim government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/need-to-work-together-on-counterterrorism-us-deputy-secretary-of-state-in-india/articleshow/86819787.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: MNS tells officials to fix VIP Road within a week||AURANGABAD: The stretch of road from the Cidco bus stand to the Harsul t-point, commonly known as the VIP Road, has developed potholes at many places severely inconveniencing the motorists. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Wednesday gave a week’s time to the authorities concerned to carry out the necessary repair works. MNS district president Suhas Dashrathe pointed out that the nearly 5km road was made ready by the public works department (PWD) in May this year at a cost of Rs 60 lakh. The monsoon rain has exposed the sub-standard quality of works as the road is riddled with potholes again. “The VIP Road has around 2,000 potholes, making commuting along this stretch a nightmare for four-wheeler drivers and two-wheeler riders. Large-scale corruption is responsible for the road developing so many potholes within a few weeks,” he said. On Wednesday, the local unit of the MNS also held a symbolic protest during which pooja of the potholes was carried out. Another MNS functionary, Ashok Pawar, said it was outrageous that the VIP Road, which is on the route to the World Heritage Site of the Ajanta Caves, is in such a bad condition. “While on one hand Aurangabad is said to be a part of the Smart City Mission, on the other hand, an important road is pothole-ridden beyond imagination. Such shoddy work is definitely projecting the city in a bad light in front of foreign tourists besides giving troubled rides to local citizens,” he said. Earlier, Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan, during his official visit to Aurangabad on September 26, had said that entirely new construction of the VIP Road was on cards, instead spending money on repairs. Local Congress and Shiv Sena leaders from Aurangabad had raised the demand for repairs before Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mns-tells-officials-to-fix-vip-road-within-a-week/articleshow/86819861.cms||---

Earlier, a local farmer had claimed that an object had fallen in his farm on September 24, following which GSDA had visited the spot to conduct a detailed study. Senior geologist from GSDA Brijpalsingh Thakur said the reddish stone, which is said to have dropped from the sky, does not belong in space. “The spot inspection did not reveal impact on the ground due to the alleged fall of the object from space. Ideally, a deep depression or crater is expected to be formed on the ground due to the fall of the meteorite, which was absent. In fact, grass was growing at the alleged point of impact,” he said. Thakur said the object also does not have any burn marks on its periphery on its entry into the earth’s atmosphere. Large meteoroid spottedA relatively larger meteoroid was spotted over Aurangabad on October 3. Astronomer Amit Raka, who spotted the ‘fireball’, said it was the most spectacular meteoroid fall he had observed over the city sky so far. It was observed in the north direction, between Perseus and Auriga constellations while moving from the east to west. “Meteor showers are a phenomenon, where space rock enters earth’s atmosphere and the friction and velocity causes the spectacular show of fireball in the dark. Such phenomenon goes on around the year but such a large trail spotted on October 3 are rare,” Raka said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/experts-rule-out-farmers-claim-of-meteorite-fall-in-osmanabad/articleshow/86819876.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Bhagwat Karad blames state govt for delay in central teams’ visit||AURANGABAD: Union Minister of State for finance Bhagwat Karad on Wednesday blamed the state government for the alleged delay in the visits of the central teams to the rain-ravaged areas in Marathwada. “The Maharashtra government has not yet submitted the official report on rain-related damage incurred by Marathwada to the Centre. The central teams can visit the affected areas only after the state government submits its report to the Centre,” he said. This information has evoked sharp reactions from farmers’ groups that have criticised the state government for the alleged delay in taking official cognisance of the large-scale rain-related damage in Marathwada. Farmers’ leader Jayaji Suryawanshi said it was unfortunate that the state government could not submit the official report almost a month after the natural disaster. “Marathwada was battered by the rain early in September and even in the second half of the month. The necessary report has not been prepared so far because the process of panchanamas is yet to cover scores of affected villages. The state government needs to set its priority right,” he said. Farmers groups also said that effective help to farmers cannot be offered unless the Centre is involved in the relief measures. Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve said some rain-hit agriculture areas in Marathwada are still submerged, posing problems in carrying out panchanamas. “The state government is ensuring that not a single farmer is left out during the official process of offering relief. Once all the panchanamas are done, the necessary report will be submitted to the Centre,” he said. Karad also demanded a special relief package from the state government for Marathwada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/karad-blames-state-govt-for-delay-in-central-teams-visit/articleshow/86819879.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||This Durga Puja, Mumbai pandal gets a woman to create Maa Durga’s idol||Durga Puja celebrations have kicked off in the city amid the emerging new normal with all restrictions in place. This year, the Times Powai Sarvajanin Durgotsav 2021, organised by the Powai Bengali Welfare Association, is using its cultural platform to spread hope, positivity and inclusivity. For the first time, they have a female idol maker on board. Spokesperson Devraj Brahmachari says, “What makes it special this year is that the person who is giving shape to the Goddess’ idol is a woman. China Pal is the very first woman artisan who has broken all barriers and stereotypes in a male-dominated industry.” China Pal, who is happy with the opportunity, says, “I started working at 22 because my father, who was the chief artisan, fell ill and we would have defaulted on our commitment to deliver idols to two prominent Kolkata households. Had I not taken this up, it would have been difficult for us to survive as this was our only means of livelihood.” It was not an easy journey for her in this male-dominated field. She had to face multiple roadblocks. “I was initially ridiculed, then barred from doing this because people thought I am a woman and not strong enough to defend myself. Yet, I did not fight with anybody, but kept moving ahead. Today, I have a team of 8-10 male helpers,” she shares. Artisan China Pal at work on the idol for the Times Powai Sarvajanin Durgotsav 2021 Working for nearly 16 hours a day in a small studio, which also doubles up as a place of rest, she and her team sculpt almost 50 idols during the festive season. She has created many beautiful idols, big and small, and has received numerous awards for her work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/this-durga-puja-mumbai-pandal-gets-a-woman-to-create-maa-durgas-idol/articleshow/86812362.cms||Debarati S Sen

The handicraft market in Sector 56 had been a popular haunt for Gurugrammers for 15 years as a one-stop shop for cheap handicrafts, furniture and other interior décor items. However, the market had also attracted criticism for illegally occupying public land and causing a traffic snarl on busy days. The land where Banjara Market has existed all these years comes under the purview of the HSVP, formerly known as HUDA. Officials from HSVP say that over the years, despite repeated notices, the vendors hadn’t vacated the land. Last month, the authority had issued a notice to the sellers here to vacate the area but officials say the vendors didn’t leave. This led to the demolition drive undertaken on Tuesday wherein about 200 shops were cleared. Satya Narain, Sub-divisional Officer (survey), HSVP, says, "Most of the sellers had not vacated or removed items from their stalls when we arrived for the demolition on Tuesday. They have sought two days’ time. We have given them till Thursday, when we will clear the remaining encroachments." The land has been earmarked for the construction of a college and bus stand. The residents of the city are divided over the development. Some, particularly those who stay nearby, argue that the market used to cause huge traffic jams and posed security risks as well. Rajesh Khanna, a resident of Sector 56, says, "It may be a good market but it was a menace for us. The road where it was situated would always be blocked with cars parked on the sides. On weekends and during the festive season, it was impossible to even get out of the house." Mohammed Ayub, who also stays walking distance from the market, echoes this sentiment. "It used to get very crowded and dirty. And since the shops encroached the entire service lane, traffic would always be an issue," he says. Seema Singh, a Sector 54 resident, tells us, "I have done all my festive and home décor shopping from Banjara for years. I feel sad I wouldn’t be able to go there again.” Sector 43 resident Nitin adds, “If the authorities wanted to remove them, they could have sought a middle ground and given them land elsewhere, even on rent. That way, the market could have continued in a regulated manner." The vendors at the now-demolished market still harbour hope that they will be allowed to continue in a limited space at the same spot. "We want to clear our stock by the time the authority people return tomorrow," said one. Some of them say they are trying to speak to the authorities to request an alternative spot for them, where they can set up their stalls. But with the authorities in no mood to relent, for now, it seems it’s curtains for Gurgaon’s Banjara Market. Banjara Market: A brief historyThe market was established in the mid-2000s when a group of Gadiya Lohars – a nomadic tribe from Rajasthan – had set up roadside tents and shops in Sector 56. The tribe’s nomadic status – banjara in Hindi – is what gave the market its name. Over the years, as more sellers set up shop, the market grew, occupying the service lane and bylanes in a big area close to what is now the Golf Course Road. The place had become a popular spot for inexpensive and decent quality handicraft and home décor items with shoppers from all over NCR visiting it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaons-popular-shopping-spot-banjara-market-demolished-after-15-years/articleshow/86815279.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ‘Dead’ farmer fights to prove he’s alive||VIJAYAWADA: In a situation akin to Pankaj Tripathi’s recent flick ‘Kaagaz’, an elderly farmer was forced to run from pillar to post for the past one year to prove everyone that he was alive. The incident was reported from Pegallapadu village in Nellore district. Kamal Saheb, the 55-year-old farmer, told reporters on Wednesday that revenue officials were not accepting his claim that he was alive. Kamal produced a copy of his voter ID card to prove his identity in front of the village revenue office and mandal revenue office. Kamal says his younger brother, Hussein Saheb, forged records to show that he was dead to ‘illegally’ snatch one acre land that was supposed to be split 50-50 as inheritance after his father, Dastagiri, passed away last year. Kamal also claims that local revenue officials had aided his brother in registration of the land without verifying whether he is alive. “I am alive. My brother is going around falsifying records. He can have half an acre of land but I am entitled to the other half. I have been roaming around revenue offices but they are saying that they can’t do anything,” Kamal told TOI. He further added that he would prefer to resolve the matter with the help of officials rather than going to court which might take decades. In a similar incident in Uttar Pradesh, a farmer, Lal Bihari, fought a legal battle for 19 years to prove that he is alive. Based on his story, Bollywood actor Pankaj Tripathi aced the role of Lal Bihari in ‘Kaagaz’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dead-farmer-fights-to-prove-hes-alive/articleshow/86821155.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Prateep Kumar, principal chief conservator of forests, said the decision to have a brand ambassador was taken to protect Kolleru wetland site. Speaking to the media here on Wednesday, Prateep Kumar said Kolleru Lake was declared as wildlife sanctuary in 1999 and it is the responsibility of every citizen to protect such a rare herniate site. He said that the Centre has declared Kolleru as designated wetland of international importance under Ramsar Convention in 2002. “We will organize a awareness programme in Kolleru Lake as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav shortly,” said Prateep Kumar. He said they would appoint Wetland Mitras to take up awareness activities in the region. Since about 40% of the pelicans across the globe were residing in Kolleru, they thought that it was apt to select the bird as brand ambassador to create awareness about Kolleru wetland, said Prateep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/spot-billed-pelican-is-kolleru-lake-mascot/articleshow/86821571.cms||Samdani MN

Cops busted the racket in April this year with the arrest of two women. Three more persons have been arrested and 12 children have been rescued from the racketeers. The babies were handed over to the Child Welfare Committee recently. The accused are Devi Shanmugam, 26, of Vidyaranyapura, Mahesh Kumar, 50, of Kathriguppe, Dhanalakshmi, 30, of Mallasandra near Jalahalli, Janardhan alias Janardhanan, 33, of Erode in Tamil Nadu and Ranjana Devidas Kandagale, 32, of Maharashtra. On April 5, police sub-inspector Srinivas KR, who was investigating the newborn kidnap case, was tipped off by an informant about Devi, who used to purchase babies brought from Mumbai and sell them to others in the city. A team headed by inspector HM Meenakshi and Srinivas rushed to Majestic. Ranjana and Devi were caught red-handed when Devi was receiving a baby brought from Mumbai by Ranjana and others. The duo confessed that they purchased children from Mumbai and later sold them to childless couples. Probe revealed that Ranjana used to purchase the babies from couples in financial distress and supplied them to Devi, a surrogacy agent, who used to arrange surrogate mothers for the needy. Continuing their investigation into the racket, police arrested three more people — Mahesh, Janardhan and Dhanalakshmi — recently. The trio also works as surrogacy agents. Police said the agents used to hang around IVF centres and approach childless couples and women with offers of surrogacy for lesser money. They managed to convince the couples to pay them around Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh, while the actual cost for surrogacy is around Rs 15 lakh. The accused sold some of the babies they bought from Ranjana to the couples, who paid them money for surrogacy without knowing the truth about where the babies came from. The investigation also revealed that the gang had sold babies in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and in Bengaluru. The police team has also traced the real parents of 12 children and the matter is now before theChild Welfare Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/infant-sale-racket-five-held-12-babies-rescued/articleshow/86822097.cms||---

While Deogarh is yet to see even 50,000 of its population being fully vaccinated, less than one lakh of the population each in the remaining three districts are yet to get the second shots. The government authorities had expressed concern over the poor booster shot coverage and planned to mobilise those already vaccinated to get others to take the jabs. In Deogarh, about 2.15 lakh people have received the first dose, while barely 49,000 of the population have received the booster shots. Out of the 2.37 lakh people who have taken the first dose in Boudh, only around 62,000 are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/covid-vax-2nd-jab-deogarh-fares-worst/articleshow/86822224.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

---||India||Presence of SCs, STs in govt jobs still inadequate, Centre tells Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: A day after being asked to submit data on representation of Scheduled and Scheduled Tribes in central government to justify reservation in promotion, the Centre on Wednesday placed data of 19 ministries and told the Supreme Court that SCs comprise 15.34%, STs 6.18% and OBCs 17.5% of a workforce of 1,23,155. Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh told a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai that data of only 19 ministries could be compiled and assured the court that more comprehensive statistics on representation of SCs and STs would be filed in coming days. Earlier, the Attorney General had told the bench that there are 53 departments which are under control of the central governemnt and there are 5,000 cadres of employees working in them. Singh on Wednesday told the bench that in the 19 ministries surveyed, 18,898 are from Scheduled Castes (15.34%), 7,608 from Scheduled Tribes (6.18%) and 21,656 (17.5%) from Other Backward Classes. He, however, clarified that there were some anomalies in the data as SC and ST employees who got jobs in the general list are also included and also adequacy of representation differs in different classes of employment with a higher percentage in Class 3 and Class 4, but very low in Class 1. He assured the bench that class wise data would be placed before the bench. The ASG also stressed that the court should not interfere in the reservation policy if there are no arbitrariness. Pointing to the low representation in Class 1 jobs, the ASG said it is very unfortunate that we have not been able to bring SCs and STs to the same level of merit in the past 75 years and that representation is low as there is no reservation in promotion in that category. He said the ‘roster system’, that links representation to the percentage of population, has been followed by the Centre and many states and there was no need for quantifiable data. “The adequacy of representation has to be assessed with reference to a benchmark on adequacy. Conventionally, the state and the central governments have linked the percentage of reservation for the SCs and STs to their percentage of population, as a measure of adequacy which had been upheld by courts earlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/presence-of-scs-sts-in-govt-jobs-still-inadequate-centre-tells-supreme-court/articleshow/86822033.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Bengaluru||Gaming ban: MPL blocks users in state||Bengaluru: Mobile Premier League (MPL) became one of the first gaming companies to block access to its users in Karnataka, a day after the law banning online gaming became effective in the state.The law, which has been criticised by the gaming industry, bans online games involving betting and wagering, and "any act of risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill."MPL's gaming app showed messages to its users in Karnataka that said: "Sorry! The law in your state does not permit you to play Fantasy sports", "Fantasy games are locked" and "Cash games are locked". While Paytm First Games was also locked, Dream 11, backed by Tiger Global, was still functional. None of the companies could be immediately reached for comment.The move by the state government came as a surprise, primarily because Karnataka has been the hotbed for online gaming activities, generating big revenue and also providing engineering talent for cutting edge technology required to develop such games. The state has about 100 gaming companies employing about 4,000 people.“As the apex industry body, we have notified our member companies to block Karnataka in accordance with the law. However, we would like to reiterate our stand that legitimate online skill gaming businesses that have the right to trade have been worst impacted. The irony is that illegal offshore gambling operators will flourish,” said Roland Landers, CEO of All India Gaming Federation.Landers added that the industry will challenge the law in court and seek legal recourse as the Madras High Court had recently struck down a similar Act that tried to stop online skill gaming in Tamil Nadu.The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) had said the bill may hurt Karnataka’s position as the country's startup hub and lead to the loss of jobs and revenue for the state. The Indian gaming market, as per IAMAI, is poised to be worth $3.9 billion by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gaming-ban-mpl-blocks-users-in-state/articleshow/86822252.cms||---

With this, the company — now valued at $1.9 billion — became the second crypto platform in India to turn into a unicorn. Earlier, CoinDCX was valued at $1.1 billion when it raised a $90-million round in August. CoinSwitch Kuber will use the funds to increase its customer base and introduce new crypto products. It also plans to hire people across engineering, product and data. Its CEO and co-founder Ashish Singhal told TOI last week that it plans to have an employee strength of 1,500 by the end of this fiscal, up from 350 currently. A third of the talent will be engineers, specialising in data, security, and solving other complex engineering problems. There is a growing interest among institutions to enter the crypto market, which IT industry body Nasscom estimates can have an economic value addition of $184 billion by 2030 in India. “CoinSwitch Kuber is on a mission to build wealth for Indians by making crypto more accessible. I believe simplifying crypto investments for the Indian youth has helped us to stand out. We wanted to remove all the complexities in crypto trading, educate consumers and give them a simplified experience of one-click buy and sell in crypto,” Singhal said. Despite regulatory uncertainty around crypto in India, Singhal believes that global investors have seen similar instances play out in various countries and are looking at the longer-term horizon. “Since March last year (when the court quashed the RBI ban on cryptocurrency trade), India has become the number two crypto market in the world,” he said. More than half of CoinSwitch Kuber’s user base are youngsters below 30 years, and almost 55% are from tier II and III cities. The company has been approached by numerous institutions and HNIs about investments in crypto, and says it is working to be ready with products catering to institutional clients by the time regulations are made more clear. “We are incredibly excited about the crypto market opportunity in India, and with its breakout growth, CoinSwitch has emerged as the leading retail platform in the country,” said David George, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/coinswitch-30th-unicorn-this-yr-2nd-1bn-crypto-co/articleshow/86822254.cms||---

While Kannadigas call these displays Bombe Habba, Tamilians celebrate the festival as Bommai Kolu and Telugu speakers as Bommala Pandaga. Shanta Nagaraj, a homemaker, is planning to arrange her display on Mysore Palace and KRS Park models. The Isro Layout resident says her collection comprises more than 1,000 dolls and the Pattada Bombe (main doll set) is more than 100 years old and has been in her family for generations. “This year, I will exhibit all my original dolls, traditional and miniature antique pieces, stuffed dolls, clay kitchen set and Channapatna dolls,” she says.  Shanta is also expecting more visitors this year. Deepthi Srikanth, a logistics professional, says like every year, she will celebrate Dasara with her sister Preethi Ramesh. She says compared to last year, the Dasara celebrations look livelier this year. “Shops are filled with buyers and the situation looks much closer to normal now. I have already received an invite from five of my friends for the celebrations,” she says. Deepthi and Preethi narrate the stories and themes of their arrangements to their visitors, and Deepthi says it is especially rewarding to meet children. “They remember what we had explained to them the previous year and ask us questions,” she says, adding that they will also follow the Navratri colour codes. Srinivasan Raghavan, 63, a resident of Indiranagar, told TOI that with people getting vaccinated, things are looking better and he hopes to welcome more visitors to see his doll arrangement. His theme-based arrangements attract more than 100 family and friends every year. Raghavan, who has been decorating his home for Dasara for 40 years, says he has put in a lot of effort for the arrangements, and even travelled to the actual location of his model — Nava Narasimhar temples in Ahobilam (80km from Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh) — created with more than 300 dolls. “I have created a miniature model of nine temples,” the Indiranagar resident says, adding that he planned the design three months ago and created details like mountains, caves, waterfalls, river bed rocks, bridges and rusty road to the temples in the last one month. Relaxation of Covid restrictions helped him travel to Ahobilam. “I could get all the details accurately and even got my raw materials easily as the pandemic had waned,” he says. Low-key celebrationSome Bengalureans are also choosing to keep their guard up and have a low-key celebration. Arun Ramachandran and his wife Archana Gopalakrishnan, who used to display more than 500 dolls, have decided to not have any display this year. “Our friends and groups, some of whom would travel all the way from Chennai to see our decorations, have huge expectations from us. Though many have been vaccinated, the situation is not completely normal yet. So, we are being cautious,” the Hebbal resident said. With 150-year-old idols passed on to them through generations, Arun says these decorations are like mini-projects for them that involve a lot of planning. Another Hebbal resident, Krishna Prasad, says he will wait for another year before he returns to his 32-year-long tradition of displaying 800 dolls based on myriad themes. “If I display the dolls, I can’t stop my friends and family from visiting. But for everyone’s safety, I will limit Dasara this year to family puja,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/blureans-deck-up-homes-with-doll-displays-for-dasara/articleshow/86822268.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Woman told she’s vulnerable to witchcraft loses Rs 4.4 crore||BENGALURU: A 50-year-old woman has alleged that miscreants have siphoned off over Rs 4.4 crore from her by installing fear in her saying she was vulnerable to witchcraft and, hence, faced difficulties in life. Basavanagudi women police have arrested two persons, including a woman, and have recovered around Rs10 lakh in cash, 1kg gold jewellery and 12kg silver articles from them. The accused are Jayashri, 48, a resident of Tyagarajanagar, and Rakesh KV, 37, a resident of Banashankari 3rd Stage. Shantha (name changed), a resident of Koramangala, told police that she knew Jayashri for more than two years and used to share everything with her about her personal life, including some legal issues. Jayashri told Shantha that she has good knowledge about witchcraft, saying her relatives had practised it on her. Jayashri advised black magic to rid Shantha of her problems, saying otherwise she and her family would bleed to death. Scared, Shantha discussed this with her husband Gurudev and asked Jayashri to perform black magic to save her family. A person identified as Bushan and Jayashri claimed to have performed black magic in her house in July last year. From then till March this year, the gang collected over Rs 4.4 crore from Shantha and her husband. The couple borrowed money from friends and pledged their gold jewellery. The couple suspected something fishy as their problems didn’t go away. On July 18, the couple visited Jayashri’s residence and asked her to return their money. But Jayashri and a group of men allegedly assaulted the couple and threatened to kill them. According to sources, Jayashri is a self-proclaimed astrologer, who used to tell people that they must perform special pujas to get out of problems and would extort money from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-told-shes-vulnerable-to-witchcraft-loses-4-4-crore/articleshow/86822295.cms||---

They released the victim after he promised to pay Rs 5 lakh the next day. The victim, Srinivas S, is a resident of Basaveshwaranagar and owner of a wholesale onion shop in the AMPC yard in Yeshwantpur. According to Srinivas, a man wearing khaki shirt waylaid his vehicle near Ashokapura Main Road in Mahalakshmi Layout around 9am on September 30. “The man introduced himself as an I-T official and asked me to accompany him to meet his senior. I got down from my vehicle and walked towards a Toyota Innova. The man sitting inside the SUV told me there was an inquiry against me. I asked him to come to my shop or home to talk. He refused, saying it was an urgent matter and directed me to sit inside the SUV. The vehicle moved towards Kempegowda International Airport,” Srinivas stated in his complaint. Two men sitting on either side of Srinivas produced bank transaction documents saying they were related to Srinivas, adding they had enough evidence to prove that he was cheating the government by paying less tax.“I resisted saying I will speak to them through my advocate, but they slapped me and issued dire threats. Then they demanded Rs 50 lakh for not filing a case against me. They finally agreed to Rs 5 lakh. I promised to pay the next day and was let off,” the complaint read. “We have collected CCTV footage from the road where the suspects took Srinivas in their SUV. Also, we have zeroed in on some mobile numbers. We strongly suspect that it is the work of people known to him,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hunt-on-for-i-t-officers-booked-in-kidnap-case/articleshow/86822299.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Diesel closes in on Rs 100/litre, transporters warn of inflation||BENGALURU: The price of diesel in the city on Wednesday touched a record Rs 97/litre, going up from Rs 64.4/ litre in March 2020, an increase of just under Rs 33 in 19 months. In Maharashtra, for instance, it has breached the Rs 100 mark due to increasing global crude oil prices and no tax cuts by the Union and state governments. Meanwhile, the price of petrol was Rs 106.5/litre here on Wednesday. Truck drivers said increasing diesel prices will result in a spike in prices of essential and non-essential commodities, especially during the festive season.  President of Federation of Karnataka Lorry Owners’ Association President B Channa Reddy said: “Skyrocketing diesel prices will increase the price of essential items. Many small truck operators are struggling to survive, especially after Covid-19. This is not the right time to increase fuel prices. Many people are not feeling the pinch because of reduction of consumption and much of the floating population has left the city after Covid-19.” He said the association can’t protest as members are divided. “We have many unions and associations. It’s difficult to bring everyone together to protest,” he added. Many taxi and bus drivers as well as State Transport Undertakings (STUs) are also facing a bleak future. “We’re struggling to make ends meet. The increasing diesel price is forcing many cab drivers to sell or surrender their cars as they can’t earn enough to pay the EMIs. Many drivers have taken up other work like food delivery. Despite the increase in fuel and LPG prices, people are silent. The poor response to the recent Bharth bandh indicated people are ready to pay,” said K Somashekhar, president, Namma Chalakara Trade Union. Cab driver S Manjunath said: “I cannot skip even a day of work for protest because the income has come down drastically.” Many private bus operators say there’s little scope to increase fares as the demand on inter-city routes has reduced due to Covid-19 and work from home arrangements. STUs said soaring the diesel price and reduced ridership are hitting them hard and they’re looking at inducting more electric buses. Oil industry sources said the main causes are sudden increase in international oil prices, global output disruptions and increasing demand. “Prices are revised based on factors like average price of benchmark fuel in the international market and foreign exchange rates,” said an official. Fuel prices are also determined by freight and refining expenses, profit margins of oil marketing companies, dealers’ commission, central duties such as excise, and state duties such as VAT and other taxes. Meanwhile, there’s fear of adulteration due to the rise in prices and this results in particulate pollution and frequent engine malfunction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/diesel-closes-in-on-100/litretransporters-warn-of-inflation/articleshow/86822339.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Only one idol can be installed in every ward and they should not be more than 4ft in height. Idols should be sanitised thoroughly before installation. Associations organising the puja should ensure that not more than 50 people are allowed at a time during prayers, not more than 100 at a time during darshan and a maximum of 10 members during Debi Boron or Visarjan. All safety precautions, including mandatory thermal screening and sanitisation of all visitors, must be taken. Sanitiser bottles must be placed in multiple places at the venue. The order also states chairs, tables and floor should be sanitised at least four times a day and safety norms for Covid-19 must be displayed at the premises. Rudra Shankar Roy, one of the main organisers of the Bengaluru Durga Puja Committee, said, “We’re absolutely fine with the guidelines. We understand it has done its bit and now we have to do our bit and manage venues with all precautionary measures. It’ll definitely be different but we understand why.” The association has to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at all time inside the venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/durga-puja-idols-should-be-less-than-4-feet-tall/articleshow/86822344.cms||---
---||India||Snake a deadly murder weapon, SC denies bail to two||NEW DELHI: Accidental snakebite deaths may be common in India, but the Supreme Court on Wednesday said it is a heinous crime to use a poisonous snake as a ‘weapon’ to murder an elderly woman and refused to grant bail to the accused in a case from Rajasthan. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli was dealing with this unique case. A woman, married to an army man who was posted away from his hometown, was regularly talking to her paramour over phone, which was objected to by her mother-in-law. Her father-in-law too was away as he worked outside his hometown. Irked by the nagging reprimands of her MIL, the daughter-in-law in conspiracy with her paramour and his friend, procured a poisonous snake from a snake charmer in Jhunjhunu district. Wrapped in a bag, she kept the snake near her MIL’s bed on the night of June 2, 2018. The elderly woman was found dead in the morning. The hospital she was taken to declared she died of snakebite. Snakebite deaths being a normal occurrence in Rajasthan and many other states, the Jhunjhunu police took time to discover an unusual number of phone call exchanges, over 100, between the daughter-in-law and her paramour during the fateful night. It also found that these two have been in constant touch for a long time over the phone. The police arrested the three — the woman, her paramour and his friend — and traced down the snake charmer from whom the ‘murder weapon’ was procured. The snake charmer turned approver and gave a statement under Section 164 CrPC before a magistrate that the paramour had procured the snake from him. Arguing for the paramour, advocate Aditya Kumar Choudhary told the bench that his client was not present at the crime scene. “How would he be a part of the conspiracy when no one can predict whom the snake will bite? Just leaving a poisonous snake in the room does not mean the snake knew whom it should bite. The police have not authenticated the call records. The man is behind bars for more than a year.” To that, the bench said, “It is very common in Rajasthan to use poisonous snakes for committing murders. You have used an innovative method to commit a heinous crime. You were allegedly part of the conspiracy and provided the murder weapon (snake) after procuring it from the snake charmer. You do not deserve to be released on bail at this stage.” There are around five million snakebite cases worldwide every year causing around 1,00,000 deaths. India accounts for almost half of them. A WHO report said India had an estimated 1.2 million snake bite deaths (averaging 58,000 every year) in the period between 2000-2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/snake-a-deadly-murder-weapon-sc-denies-bail-to-two/articleshow/86822731.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Under fire, government agrees to revert to old NEET-SS pattern||NEW DELHI: Put under the pump following scathing criticism from the Supreme Court, the Centre, National Medical Commission and National Board for Education in medical sciences buckled and informed the court that the NEET-Super Speciality examinations will be as per the erstwhile pattern for the academic year 2021-22. The changed pattern will be applicable from the 2022-23 session onwards. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati for the Centre and senior advocate Maninder Singh for NBE informed that in deference to the SC’s views, it has been decided to implement the new pattern of question and subject-wise distribution of marks, implementation of which from current academic session was under challenge, from the following academic years. As of now, the court decided not to go into the correctness of the new examination pattern. As many as 41 MD doctors had approached the SC through advocate Javedur Rehman alleging that the government changed the rules of the game after the starting whistle by completely altering the question pattern and subject-wise distribution of marks for the NEET-SS from what it was since 2018 and notifying the changes more than a month after the schedule of examination was announced. This, they said, jeopardised preparations of 12,000 doctors aspiring for super speciality courses. Bhati informed the court that doubts of the SC about changes being made to benefit private medical colleges were unfounded as from among 414 colleges offering super speciality courses, 118 in government, and 296 in private sector and as many as 802 seats went vacant last year. Of these vacancies, 561 were in private and 241 in government medical colleges. “The decision to change the pattern was taken in the larger interest of the student community,” the ASG said. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna, which had given the government less than 24 hours to course correct and even warned of stepping in to set right the obduracy on its part, termed the Centre’s decision “very fair” and said since the erstwhile examination pattern has been restored, the court would not go into adjudication of the correctness of the new examination pattern. However, the bench kept the window open for mounting legal challenges to the validity of the new examination pattern in future. The bench had on Tuesday said, “You cannot be causing prejudice to the students. If there is a sense of obduracy (on the part of the authorities in not reverting to the old pattern of examination), the arms of law are long enough to deal with the obduracy. We have given you time till tomorrow to reform. NMC and NBE are not doing any favour to the students. We are giving you an opportunity to correct yourself.” Justice Chandrachud had said NEET-SS is unlike other examinations. “The students prepare for years, right from their postgraduation in medicine days to get admission into super speciality courses after doing their masters. We know the private sector has invested money in offering the super speciality courses and their interest too has to be factored in while doing the balancing act. However, the interest of the students, who will be the torch bearers of advanced healthcare in India in future, cannot be sidelined,” he said. The petitioners, preparing for the NEET-SS exam scheduled for November 10-11, had complained the authorities had arbitrarily changed the earlier pattern of examination (40% questions from general medicine and 60% from the super speciality course applied for) to a new pattern (100% questions from general medicine).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/under-fire-government-agrees-to-revert-to-old-neet-ss-pattern/articleshow/86822883.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Chennai||Displaying Holy Cross no ground to cancel Scheduled Caste certificate, says Madras HC||MADURAI: Can a Holy Cross and other religious symbols and practices displayed by a dalit be cited to cancel his/her Scheduled Caste certificate? No, said the Madras high court, calling it a “bureaucratic narrow-mindedness” the Constitution never foresaw. In a recent order, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M Duraiswamy held that merely because a member of the dalit community married a Christian and her children have been recognised as members of her husband’s community, the SC certificate issued to her cannot be cancelled. The court made the observations while allowing a petition filed by P Muneeswari of Ramanathapuram district in 2016, seeking to quash a 2013 order passed by the district collector cancelling her community certificate. A doctor by profession, she was born to Hindu Pallan (a Scheduled Caste) parents and certified so in accordance with law. She then married a Christian and raised her children also as members of the Christian community. Citing this, her certificate was revoked by the district authorities. When she challenged the decision in court, officials said they visited her clinic and found a Holy Cross hanging on the wall. On this basis, the officials conjectured that she had converted to Christianity and was, thus, disqualified from retaining the Hindu Pallan community certificate. Slamming the argument, the first bench said: "There is no suggestion in the affidavit that she has abandoned her faith or that she has embraced Christianity. It is equally possible that she, as a part of a family, may accompany her husband and children for Sunday matins, but the mere fact that a person goes to church does not mean that such person has altogether abandoned the original faith to which such person was born." The judges further said: "The acts and conduct of the authorities portray a degree of narrow-mindedness that the Constitution does not encourage." It would do well for the members of the scrutiny committee to approach the matter with a broader mind than is evident in the present case, they said. Observing that the action taken by the authorities appeared to be arbitrary and based on surmises and conjectures without support of any material fact, the judges quashed the order passed by the district collector and directed the authorities to restore the certificate originally issued in favour of Muneeswari with immediate effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/displaying-holy-cross-no-ground-to-cancel-scheduled-caste-certificate-says-madras-hc/articleshow/86823063.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||IISc working on ‘Corridrone’ as India opens up to civilian drone usage||Bengaluru: As India opens up to civilian drone usage with new rules approved recently, a team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is working on drone skyways — a framework for efficient and safe movement for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones in urban or delimited airspace, which is also called Class G airspace.Given the challenges of organising timely delivery of medicines or organs for transplantation in a crowded city or making other commercial deliveries, the government and the private sector are both looking to leverage drones. Just this week, the government employed one such UAV to deliver vaccines in northeast India.While not much commercial activity has happened on this front yet, the anticipation is palpable and the IISc team’s work, which has been informally presented to officials from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) during one of their visits, is hoping to create virtual pathways for drones.Led by professors Ashwini Ratnoo and Debasish Ghose from the department of aerospace engineering, the team is working on what it calls CORRIDRONE: Corridors for Drones. Ratnoo’s lab works on the planning part of this autonomous UAV brain. “It’s a novel drone mobility framework which lays a lot of emphasis on design of air corridors. These designs are based on the size and capabilities of drones. Pathways in the sky are fundamentally different from those on ground. While providing greater freedom of design due to their virtual nature, drone corridors present a lot of challenges interrelating traffic efficiency, throughput, drone capability, and safety of operations,” Ratnoo explained to TOI.Ghose said that the team has received Rs 70 lakh as initial funding from the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems (RBCCPS) at IISc, while it is in talks with ARTPARK (AI & Robotics Technology Park) for collaboration. “We’ve also discussed the project with the civil aviation secretary,” Ghose said.The key features of their development include optimal lane design and placement, innovative geo-fencing solutions for confined drone movement, and a variety of planning algorithms for lane and intersection traversal. “Lane design and arrangement in air corridors must be sensitive to a variety of considerations, namely, the dimensions of the drone, its capability in accelerating or taking a turn, and collision avoidance. An optimal trade-off between these factors is what drives our solution,” Ratnoo said. Stating that geo-fencing offers virtual boundaries within which mobility of drones must be confined for safety, he said they present a three-level geo-fencing solution — the first around the drone, the second for the lane and third for the whole corridor — offering enhanced safety while maintaining traffic efficiency through a corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iisc-working-on-corridrone-as-india-opens-up-to-civilian-drone-usage/articleshow/86823112.cms||---

Bindroo was shot dead in his pharmacy on Tuesday. “You can kill one person, but you can’t kill the spirit of Makhan Lal,” Samriddhi is seen telling reporters in one among several video clips that went viral. Bindroo and two other civilians were killed in separate attacks by the Pakistan-backed TRF the same evening. Read AlsoActivists’ ‘silence’ on J&amp;K civilian killings questionedNEW DELHI: Security agencies have questioned the silence of human rights activists and groups on the killing of three innocent civilians in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, with senior officers asking if police action against terrorists and overground workers alone counts as “human rights violations”Challenging the terrorists, she said, “The mister who shot my father dead while he was working...have a face-to-face debate with us. Then we will see what you are. You won’t be able to utter a word.” Samriddhi also spoke about how her father didn’t cower in front of terrorists during the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in the early 90s and stayed put to build his business — the landmark Bindroo Medicate pharmacy in Iqbal Park — and raise a young family. “I am an associate professor. I have started from zero…my father started from a bicycle, my brother is a famous diabetologist, my mother sits in the shop — that is what Makhan Lal Bindroo made us. A Kashmiri Pandit, he will never die.” Recalling how she was the only Hindu girl in her class after the Kashmiri Pandit purge, Samriddhi said, “Despite being a Hindu, I have read the Quran. The Quran says you may kill the body, the spirit lives on. Bindroo will remain alive in spirit."

Five AK-47 rifles and 1,000 live bullets and 300kg heroin were found on the Sri Lankan boat off Kerala coast in March. The arrested person was identified as Satkunam alias Sabesan (47), a Sri Lankan national and a former member of LTTE’s intelligence wing, presently residing in Chennai. He was involved in arms and drug trafficking from Pakistan to Sri Lanka, and utilizing the proceeds for supporting the revival of LTTE, NIA said in a statement. NIA registered the case on May 1 against six Sri Lankan nationals based on a complaint by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) that five AK-47 rifles and 1,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition were seized along with 300kg of heroin off Minicoy coast upon interception of the fishing vessel, Ravihansi, by the Coast Guard on March 18. “The investigation has revealed that accused Satkunam had arranged conspiracy meetings of sympathisers of LTTE in India. He played a crucial role in routing the proceeds of drug trafficking to former LTTE cadres in Sri Lanka for the revival of the LTTE. Further investigation in the case continues,” NIA said in the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/key-conspirator-in-kerala-drugs-arms-haul-case-arrested/articleshow/86823630.cms||---

She has sent friend requests to some ITR staff and started chatting up with them via Facebook Messenger. We are keeping a close watch and will take action accordingly,” additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Sanjeeb Panda told TOI. The probe agency, which is yet to ascertain the name of the Pakistani agent, said she had opened seven accounts on Facebook, all in fictitious Indian names. “We have found that she had operated three Facebook accounts from Islamabad and one from Rawalpindi to honey-trap the five who were arrested earlier. She used proxy IP addresses of India, Germany and US to operate the other three Facebook accounts,” Panda said. Experts said the Crime Branch probe is mostly likely to come to a halt as the agent is from Pakistan. “Even if the Crime Branch takes the help of Interpol, it will not be able to identify the foreign handler and other gang members, who belong to Pakistan. The Crime Branch should gather credible evidence and substantiate the Pakistan link in court so that the accused are convicted,” said Sidharth Das, a senior lawyer said. Basanta Behera, Hemanta Mistri, Tapas Ranjan Nayak, Sheikh Musafir and Sachin Kumar, who were allegedly honey-trapped by the Pakistani handler, were arrested by Balasore police on September 14 for sharing classified information regarding the ITR with the foreign agent. Sources said the woman had been in touch with the five through a UK SIM since February last year. The accused allegedly sent photos and data related to the missile tests, cluster bombs and atomic power systems of the ITR to her. One of the accused had allegedly received Rs 38,000 from an account in Dubai. The probe agency said the possibility of more financial transactions between the accused and the agent cannot be ruled out. Cyber experts of the Crime Branch have been engaged to thoroughly scan social media handles and phones of the accused and their chats with the agent. The mobile phones and laptops of the accused have been sent to the cyber forensic laboratory here for examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/cb-confirms-pak-nationality-of-woman-in-itr-spy-case-claims-she-is-still-active/articleshow/86823830.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

H R Biswas, director of regional IMD centre said the possible influence of the system over the state would be clear in subsequent days. “However, light to moderate rainfall due to thunderstorm activities will continue in isolated manner for the next few days,” Biswas said. “The fresh system indicates high probability of intensifying into a cyclonic storm or more. But more details on this system would be clear in coming days,” said Sarat Chandra Sahu, director of the centre for environment and climate at SOA deemed to be university. The forecast comes even as southwest monsoon started withdrawing from parts of west Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat on Wednesday. Biswas said it would withdraw further in the days to come. IMD’s fresh bulletin stated that conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some more parts of Gujarat, entire Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Madhya Pradesh.

Accordingly, the Orissa high court has ordered, “It is directed that if the petitioner so surrenders in the first hour before the court in the aforesaid case and moves for bail, the court shall consider and dispose of his bail application on its own merit on the same day after giving a chance of hearing to the informant-victim in this case”. The single-judge bench of Justice S Pujahari issued the direction on Tuesday after senior lawyer Ashok Mohanty appeared on Jagdev’s behalf and informed about the surrender along with bail plea and sought direction to the concerned subordinate court to dispose it of on the same day. Pre-arrest bail was also sought by the Chilika MLAs counsel. Justice Pujahari, however, said, “The aforesaid liberty of surrender should not be construed as any protection from arrest given to the petitioner”. But the judge specified that if the informant victim does not appear and has his response on the date fixed, no adjournment shall be granted on the bail plea on that date on that ground in any manner. The up-to-date case diary will be made available to the court concerned by the investigating officer on the date of consideration of the bail plea of the petitioner. “If the investigating officer does not produce the case diary before the court concerned on the date fixed, the court concerned shall not await for the same and decide the bail application of the petitioner on its own merit taking allegation made in the FIR,” Justice Pujahai further specified in the order. In the FIR lodged against Jagdev, Balugaon Nagar BJP President Niranjan Sethi alleged that the MLA slapped him. The incident occurred in front of the NAC office at around 3 pm on September 8. Balugaon Police registered a case under Sections 294, 323, 341 and 506 of IPC and SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Subsequently, Jagdev was suspended from the party (BJD) and also removed as chairperson of the Khurda district planning committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/chilika-mla-to-surrender-in-court/articleshow/86823884.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

The report stated that only 38% schools have working power connection and that 11% schools have vacancies and there is a requirement of around 28,816 teachers in the state. “Following the outbreak of Covid-19, the use of technology in education became important but there were several issues like lack of devices and internet connectivity, lack of preparedness of teachers in the use of technology and lack of resources in regional languages,” the report mentioned. “To overcome the challenges faced by the education system due to the closure of schools and lack of access to technology like internet and computers, the state government made arrangements of classes through radio and television. We also used YouTube so that children could see the recorded version of lessons as and when they had access,” school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash said when asked about the report. Odisha has shown improvement in some major infrastructure facilities like around 94% schools have libraries while 84% schools are getting free textbooks. In 90% schools, boys’ toilets are functional while it is 93% for girls’ toilets. Almost all schools — 99% — have functional drinking water facilities available, the report added. Regarding the availability of teachers in schools, the report stated, “Odisha has a total of 3,40,477 teachers in 68,717 schools of which 91% schools are in rural areas. Among the total number of teachers, 45% are women and 84% work in rural areas. About 11% schools have vacancies and there is a requirement of around 28,816 teachers. Of the total positions, 67% are vacant in rural schools.” The report also revealed that there are 3,197 schools with a single teacher, which is 5% of the total number of schools. As many as 88% of such schools are in rural areas. “Though the teachers’ strength is not bad in the state, but due to lack of proper rationalisation policy, more teachers are posted in urban and semi-urban schools while vacancy of teachers is more in rural schools,” said Anil Pradhan, convener of Right to Education (RTE) forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-scores-big-in-school-infra-low-in-edu-tech/articleshow/86823895.cms||Minati Singha
---||India||After release from Sitapur guesthouse, Priyanka joins Rahul & 3 other Congmen to visit ground zero Kheri||LUCKNOW: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was released after a three-day confinement at PAC headquarters in Sitapur, joined brother Rahul to visit ground zero Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday along with three other party leaders, but not before an hour-long high-octane drama at Lucknow airport after Rahul refused to board a government vehicle. Rahul took the Lucknow flight at 12:45 pm en route to Lakhimpur Kheri, following the UP government's decision at noon to allow entry of politicians in groups of five. While Congress chief ministers of Punjab and Chhattisgarh, Chiranjeet Singh Channi and Bhupesh Baghel respectively, and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda accompanied the Gandhi siblings to Kheri, Rajasthan Congress leader Sachin Pilot was detained at Moradabad. Both Channi and Baghel announced a combined compensation of Rs 1 crore each to families of deceased farmers in Tikunia village, where eight persons were killed in violence after an SUV ploughed through protesting farmers last Sunday. Soon after Rahul’s announcement in Delhi of his Lakhimpur Kheri visit, roads to Lucknow airport were barricaded and the airport terminal fortified by police and a CISF platoon even as hundreds of slogan-shouting Congress workers trooped into the Amausi airport area. By the time Rahul’s flight entered Unnao airspace, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash and other police officials reached the airport. Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash said they received the Congress leaders and informed them only five people could travel to Lakhimpur Kheri as prohibitory orders have been imposed in the district. After Rahul touched down with Chhattisgarh CM Baghel, Punjab’s Channi, party general secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala, sparks flew as they were escorted to the lounge and purportedly told to travel in government vehicles to Sitapur. Spurning the diktat, Rahul, along with Baghel, Channi and Venugopal sat on a dharna inside the airport premises. “Police have stopped us at the airport even after the UP government's nod to travel to Sitapur en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. They are forcing us to board government vehicles, but we won’t,” Gandhi told reporters. Congress workers too joined the protest outside the airport. Earlier, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI that the government has imposed restrictions on travel to Kheri to maintain law and order. Anybody can visit Kheri, but only in a group of five or less.” By 3:15 pm, the district administration blinked and the Congress leaders were told to travel in their own vehicles to Sitapur, where they joined Priyanka Gandhi after 5pm. From there, Gandhi siblings along with Baghel, Channi and Hooda left for Lakhimpur Kheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priyanka-released-from-sitapur-guesthouse-rahul-3-other-congmen-visit-ground-zero-kheri/articleshow/86823682.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, along with Congress representative Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda visited the families of farmers who were killed. The Congress representatives arrived at Bhagwantnagar, where one of the farmers who died, Lovepreet Singh, 20, lived, around 9.30pm. It was the first stop on their route. “I only had one thing to ask for — I demanded justice for my son. She (Priyanka Gandhi) said she would fight for me,” Lovepreet’s father Satnam Singh told TOI after the Congress representatives left. They were headed for Nighasan to meet the family of local news channel journalist Raman Kashyap, who was also killed in Sunday’s violence. Earlier in the day, roads to the Chaudhary Charan Singh International (Lucknow) Airport had been barricaded, with police and CISF deployed while hundreds of Congress workers gathered. Rahul had announced he would be in Lakhimpur Kheri. By the time his flight reached the Unnao airspace, Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash and other police officials had reached the airport. “We received the Congress leaders and informed them that only five people could travel to Lakhimpur Kheri as prohibitory orders are in place,” the DM said. Rahul was travelling with Baghel, Channi, and party secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. When they were told they had to travel to Sitapur, where Priyanka had been detained over the past two days, in government vehicles, the Congress representatives protested. “Police stopped us at the airport even after the UP government’s permission to travel to Sitapur en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. They are forcing us to board government vehicles, but we won't,” Rahul told reporters there. Congress workers joined the dharna. Around 3.15pm, the district administration told them they could travel in their own vehicles. They met Priyanka at Sitapur around 5pm and, from there, left for Lakhimpur Kheri. AAP MP Sanjay Singh also visited Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. Around 8.30pm, he reached Nighasan and met journalist Kashyap’s brother Pawan. He made him speak to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. “I will fight for your justice,” the latter told Pawan. Rajasthan Congress MLA and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot, however, could not make it to Lakhimpur Kheri after being stopped at Moradabad. He tweeted, “This evening @AcharyaPramodk ji & I were detained in Moradabad while en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. We didn’t break any provisions of the law. These undemocratic steps of UP Govt will not deter us. We’ll raise our voice for justice for the deceased farmers & their families.” Watch Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi meet victims’ families||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-days-on-up-allows-netas-into-kheri-rahul-priyanka-meet-farmers-kin/articleshow/86824016.cms||---

A recent communication by state finance secretary Vishal Dev to all departments stated that the state economy is projected to grow by about 9.5% in the current fiscal while it is expected to register a growth of about 9% in 2022-23. Stating that there is an optimism in the resource outlook during the 2021-22 fiscal owing to the recovery of the economy, the finance secretary, while asking departments to submit proposals for the annual budget by December 15, said the state government has been consistently monitoring the revenue collection with a specific focus on mopping up arrears. In the 2019-20 fiscal, growth was around 6% compared to the previous year with the size of the economy (gross state domestic product) at Rs 5.33 lakh crore. After the contraction in 2020-21, the size of the economy got reduced to around Rs 5.10 lakh crore which is expected to be around Rs 5.80 lakh crore this financial year. Central aid has also fallen: Finance secyThe efforts of the state government in the mining sector have substantially enhanced overall collection of its own tax and non-tax revenue compared to previous year. “Considering the year 2020-21 as an aberration, the growth of own tax and non-tax revenue is still modest when compared to the level of collection in 2019-20 and a time lag of two years,” said the finance secretary. Dev said the receipt of share tax and grant-in-aid from the Centre till August has also declined compared to the previous financial year. As it has been estimated that the state’s revenues are expected to register moderate growth in the next fiscal, the government has also decided to increase spending in different sectors in the next year. Even as the state has been fighting the pandemic with focus on saving life and livelihoods, the finance secretary said the government’s priorities in the medium-term remains faster reduction of poverty, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-eco-likely-togrow-by-9-5-in-21-22/articleshow/86821640.cms||Sujit Kumar Bisoyi

The man (45) died on Tuesday while undergoing treatment at a Solapur hospital. His wife has survived. When contacted, Osmanabad superintendent of police Neeva Jain said, “A case of accidental death has been registered in Solapur. We are in the process of registering a case of abetment to suicide against the members of the caste panchayat.” The officer said the couple’s relatives had demanded registration of case against the caste panchayat. “We have told the victim’s family to specifically mention names of the suspect members of the caste panchayat, instead of merely mentioning the panchayat that is not a registered or legal entity,” she said. After the man’s death, his family members took the hearse carrying his body to the district collector’s office on Tuesday. Later in the evening, the last rites were performed amid heavy police bandobast. Osmanabad district collector Kaustubh Diwegaonkar told TOI that the family had told him that a caste panchayat was allegedly held on September 22 against the deceased for allegedly having an extra-marital affair.

While AICC accused the UP government of being selective in targeting Congress and resorting to unconstitutionality, senior party lawyers Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha threatened legal action against the state. The AICC questioned UP government’s decision to refuse permission to Rahul Gandhi, citing that a five-MP delegation of Trinamool Congress and of Bhim Army had already visited Kheri on Tuesday, without any hindrance. AICC general secretary K C Venugopal had wrote to UP government on Tuesday, seeking permission for Rahul leading a three-member team, which was turned down. On Wednesday, while slamming the denial of permission, Venugopal said Rahul was even ready to proceed to Kheri alone. Rahul then left for Lucknow with chief ministers Bhupesh Baghel and Charanjit Singh Channi, and Venugopal. Congress legal eagles and dissenting G23 members Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha warned UP government of legal action if it did not answer why Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was being detained and denied legal counsel, and political leaders and chief ministers were being denied entry in Uttar Pradesh and not allowed to visit families of farmer victims in Lakhimpur Kheri. In a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the two senior lawyers said Priyanka’s arrest was unconstitutional and the state government is trampling on the constitutional rights denying entry without reason. They also asked why no action had been taken against the son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra, and why the PM had not yet sacked him in view of the facts that have come to light about the farmers’ killings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-letter-war-congress-says-up-govt-biased-threatens-legal-action/articleshow/86824613.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Mishra, who is also the MP from Kheri, is said to have briefed Shah about all aspects of the incident, in which 3 BJP workers as well as a journalist were killed in the retaliatory violence, allegedly by the farm protesters who had gathered near the junior home minister's village. Meanwhile, sources said there is no plan to review Ajay Mishra’s current ministerial assignment, as being demanded by the opposition as well as farmers’ leaders. Mishra has refuted the claim of the farmers and opposition that his son Ashish was driving the vehicle that allegedly mowed down the farmers, and maintained that he was not at the scene of crime at all. “An investigation by any agency can establish this,” a source said adding that the minister’s son will fully cooperate with the probe. However, sources did not rule out the possibility of early action against the minister's son who has been named in the FIR registered by the farmers in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri deaths. He will have to face the probe and whatever action is warranted under the law. “Due process under the law will be followed,” a source said. Sources in Lucknow also indicated that there was a strong likelihood of Ashish being arrested because of the FIR. While UP police are looking at all angles, they will come to any determination about the role of the Union minister and his son after scanning the electronic evidence like CCTV footage, location of mobile phones and logs of conversations and messages on their respective devices. Before meeting Shah, Ajay Mishra had visited his office in North Block to attend to some work but left half an hour later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/first-time-since-up-incident-ajay-mishra-teni-meets-amit-shah-briefs-him/articleshow/86824739.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, Singh said the opposition was trying to turn a crisis into a political opportunity but “would not succeed” in denting BJP’s prospects. The state BJP chief said various pro-farmer policies framed by the Modi government at the Centre and the Yogi Adityanath government in UP have benefited the farming community and brought it close to the ruling party. “Virodhi mahaul kharab kar lenge...par BJP kas nuksaan nahi kar payenge (opposition can spoil the atmosphere of the state, but can’t cause any harm to BJP),” he said. Singh’s assertion assumes political importance as the opposition has moved to corner BJP over an incident that had otherwise been deftly controlled by the state government machinery led by the CM. Political experts said the opposition was desperately seeking to turn the tables on BJP, which had stopped political leaders from reaching Lakhimpur Kheri at the peak of the crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakhimpur-will-have-no-impact-on-bjps-electoral-prospects-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/86824879.cms||Pankaj Shah

The minister has refuted allegations that his son Ashish was responsible for the farmers’ deaths. But two cars from the convoy that day have been “linked” to the minister — one belongs to him and another to his son’s “friend”. “The minister has confirmed that the (Thar) jeep was registered in his name and that he had let the driver take it for some work. The other car, a Fortuner, was registered in one Ankit Das’s name. We have found Ankit is a resident of Lucknow and the nephew of a former MP. He will definitely be questioned by the police,” a senior police official who didn’t want to be named told TOI. Images from Das’s social media profiles were shared widely on Wednesday, in which he is seen sharing the stage with BJP members, including Teni, at various events. Those in Lakhimpur Kheri identified him as Ashish’s friend. “Ankit bhaiya comes to meet Ashish bhaiya quite often. They are good friends but I don’t know if he came to Banbirpur on October 3,” a local trader who is involved in BJP’s work in Lakhimpur Kheri told TOI. A farmer who was present at the site of the Banbirpur killings on Sunday added, “One of the persons (from the convoy) we handed over to the police had told us that the Fortuner belongs to a Lucknow-based contractor. The man himself said he was a clerical officer for the contractor. Later, we realised it’s Ankit Das’s car.” Earlier in the day, Teni met Shah “after the state government submitted its report on the Kheri violence to the home department”, BJP sources told TOI. Teni had, however, denied any link between the Lakhimpur Kheri case, in which his son is an accused, and Wednesday’s meeting, telling a news agency that the reason for his Delhi visit is that he has “work and appointments” lined up. Teni is scheduled to be the chief guest of an event on prison reforms, organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, on Thursday at Mahipalpur in Delhi. While there was speculation that Teni may step down, BJP sources told TOI on Wednesday evening that it may not be on the cards. Bhartiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who has been at the forefront of the negotiations of farmers from Kheri with the administration, had demanded Teni’s resignation. There were also reports that Ashish may surrender to the police, but he had not done so at the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, BJP MLA Romi Sahni, who represents Palia in Lakhimpur Kheri, came out in strong support of farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakhimpur-violence-both-cars-in-kheri-violence-linked-to-union-minister/articleshow/86824973.cms||---

In an affidavit, the government said that to facilitate the induction of girls, there is need for authorising additional vacancies along with other associated infrastructure and administrative support in RIMC, and it would be done in a phased manner. The government said that girls will be allowed to appear in the all-India entrance examination to be conducted next year. All states and UTs compete for an average 25 seats bi-annually for RIMC. The government said that in the first phase, the capacity will be increased from 250 to 300 by inducting five girls every six months. “It is submitted that girls will be allowed to take the entrance exam scheduled in June 2022 for entry into RIMC,” it said. “In phase 2, capacity will be increased from 300 to 350 to induct 10 girls every six months, and at the end of the expansion, RIMC will have 250 boys and 100 girls,” it said, adding that final expansion will be done by by 2027.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-nda-doors-of-military-school-college-open-for-girls/articleshow/86825107.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Water resources department (WRD) secretary Sanjeev Hans on Wednesday informed CM Nitish Kumar that the construction works under the Ganga Water Lift Project (GWLP) would be completed by March, 2022 and water distribution work is likely to begin from June next year. Making a detailed presentation on the progress under the GWLP during a review meeting, Hans also informed the CM that pipeline laying works have been completed in 118km out of the 150km length on Hathidah-Motnaje-Tetar-Abgilla route. The GWLP is a part of Nitish’s ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan' aimed at minimizing the bad effects of climate change. The state government has planned to lift water from Ganga river near Hathidah in Patna district and supply it to Gaya, Bodh Gaya, Rajgir and Nawada towns through pipeline. The Ganga water will be thoroughly processed for drinking purposes within the supply chain system before reaching the consumers. Nawada town would be covered in the second phase, a WRD official said. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs2,836 crore. The first phase of the GWLP was earlier projected to be completed by June, 2021. But the works were delayed due to the Covid-induced lockdown. The CM said safe drinking water would be provided to all people in Gaya, Bodh Gaya, Rajgir and Nawada towns after lifting water from Ganga river. Nitish asked the WRD officials to work fast to complete the remaining works within the time limit. He asked the WRD officials to visit different construction sites and make proper assessment of the ongoing works to ensure drinking water supply to people in the three towns in the first phase. “Also start work to supply Ganga water to Nawada town,” he said at the meeting. Nitish further asked the WRD, the PHED and UDHD to properly coordinate among themselves to fast-track this project. While talking about Rajgir, the CM said several development works have been executed in and around the town. Population of Rajgir has increased in recent years. “Make plan of water supply to Rajgir in view of the increasing population,” Nitish said. He also asked the WRD officials to motivate people for maintaining groundwater table in their respective areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-bodh-gaya-and-rajgir-to-get-ganga-water-from-june/articleshow/86818451.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Dehradun||No mandatory deduction from pension for healthcare scheme, Uttarakhand govt tells HC||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government on Wednesday told the high court that there will be no mandatory deduction of money from the pension of its retired employees for a healthcare scheme. In an affidavit, the government told the court that the mandatory deduction of charges will be stopped from November. The submission by the state government came during the hearing of a petition, which had said that from January this year, the government had started deducting money from the pensioners’ account to provide them medical treatment under the Atal Ayushman Uttarakhand scheme. And that they were not given an option to opt out. The petitioner also cited a Supreme Court order, which said, “A pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the government” and “the right to pension is a valuable right vesting in a government servant.” The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed by Ganpat Singh Bist, who had joined the Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department in the year 1972 as a junior clerk and retired in 2011 as a senior administrative officer from Uttarakhand Public Works Department. He had claimed that earlier, the pensioners were governed by the UP Medical Attendance Rules 1946, where the facility of medical reimbursement of all bills was provided and no contribution was charged at government hospitals. In April 2012, the state government introduced the U-health card scheme for the government employees and pensioners for cashless treatment at empanelled hospitals, Bist said. “This was an optional scheme and could be availed on paying a yearly premium. But in 2018, the U-health cards were replaced with the Atal Ayushman Uttarakhand scheme. A premium of Rs 200 per month was also fixed for availing of the service.” Bist alleged that from January 1 this year, the newly-launched state government health scheme under the Atal Ayushman Yojna, was imposed on the pensioners without their consent and with hefty contribution rates, depending on their pay scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-mandatory-deduction-from-pension-for-healthcare-scheme-uttarakhand-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/86818236.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Patna||Mines dept official has Rs 1.58cr in banks, 2 flats and one shop||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police on Wednesday unearthed Rs1.58 crore deposited in different bank accounts besides assets worth Rs1.29 crore disproportionate to the known sources of income of assistant director in mines and geology department, Sanjay Kumar, during raids on his two separate locations in Patna. A 3-BHK flat and another of 1-BHK are registered in Kumar’s name in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. He also owns a shop in Khetan Market at Patna. The EOU sources said the disproportionate assets (DA) is 51% more than his known sources of income and it may soon cross over 200% as several more incriminating documents had been found during the raids. The DA case against Kumar is a fallout of his alleged connections with illegal sand mining mafias and subsequent action against against them in the last few months. Kumar, posted at the department’s headquarters in Patna, had joined service on November 12, 1987. The EOU registered a DA case against Kumar on Tuesday after procured search warrants against him. This is the seventh DA case lodged by the EOU within two months while acting against the nexus of illegal sand mining mafias with government officials. The EOU had found Rs1.58 crore deposited in 16 savings and one current bank accounts in the name of Kumar and his wife. The EOU has also unearthed investments of Rs66.65 lakh in life insurance, Kisan Vikas Patra and National Savings Scheme. The raids were conducted at his residential premises with a medical shop on Arya Kumar Road and Khush Lehenga Store in Khetan Market. When contacted, ADG (EOU) Nayyar Hasnain Khan told TOI over phone after the raids that one of the teams had recovered several incriminating documents, including Kumar’s handwritten notes indicating Rs1.5 crore in cash parked at different locations. “His daughter is pursuing higher studies in a European country without any scholarship. The educational expenses have been borne by Kumar without any external support. He needs to clarify the source of expenses,” Khan said, adding that Kumar’s son is studying in Mumbai. Khan also said the EOU had also got to know about buying immovable properties by Kumar in the recent past by paying in cash. The ADG said the EOU, during the internal inquiry, had stumbled upon strong evidence against Kumar regarding his connections with sand smugglers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mines-dept-official-has-rs-1-58cr-in-banks-2-flats-and-one-shop/articleshow/86819265.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The additional public prosecutor (APP), Rajesh Pathak, told this reporter that the survivor’s sister had registered an FIR against the minor on May 6. She stated that the accused, who lived in their neighbourhood, took the girl to his house and raped her on May 4. She narrated the ordeal to her sister the next day after which the accused was arrested on May 7. The APP added, “Police had framed charges against the minor, who pleaded not guilty, under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.” While passing the order, Mishra directed the superintendent of the correction home in Biharsharif where the convict had been lodged since his arrest on May 7 to ensure his immediate transfer to a special home in Patna. He also asked the superintendent of the special home to make sure that “the minor’s education is not affected and he is taught skill development”. Besides, the superintendent was told to apprise the court of the minor’s behavioural changes every six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minor-awarded-3-year-jail-term-for-raping-girl/articleshow/86818511.cms||Farrukh Nadim

---||Business||Tea biggies pack a punch during Covid||MUMBAI/KOLKATA: Procurement constraints and spiralling tea prices post-pandemic has been a crisis that turned into an opportunity for packaged tea players. When prices of the commodity came to a boil following the lockdown, it hit the loose tea market and data suggests that consumers converted to packaged tea. Large players with a diverse portfolio were in a better position to absorb some of these external shocks to manage product pricing better. Industry sources said the moving annual total (MAT) of the Rs 20,000-crore packaged tea market in value is growing by around 19% in August 2021, over MAT August 2020. Pre-pandemic, the growth was around 7% (2019 vs 2018). In-home consumption volume MAT, according to Kantar household panel, has grown by around 6% in August 2021 over 2020 as against 2.3% pre-Covid (2019 vs 2018), said these sources. This has changed the market dynamics too. Both Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Tata Consumer Products (TCP) gained market shares in both value and volume, according to data provided by industry sources. However, HUL has gained a leadership position in volume (22% in MAT August 2021) and has strengthened its value leadership (25% in MAT August 2021) as well. Correspondingly, TCP’s shares are at 21% in volume and 22% in value for the given period. HUL VP (tea & foods) Shiva Krishnamurthy said: “The packaged tea category has grown faster during the pandemic. Our growth has been significantly ahead of the market. We’ve been market leaders in value for 3-4 years, and in volumes, we gained a leadership position more recently. The good thing is that post-pandemic, we have consolidated and strengthened our leadership and we have widened the gap versus our closest competitors.” TCP, which was formed in February 2020, began its transformation journey, including a revamp and expansion of its sales and distribution. “Given this and the aberrations brought on by the pandemic, the right way to understand our performance in the marketplace would be to compare February 2020 value market share (pre pandemic & TCP formation) to August 2021. We have grown our value market share by 270 basis points according to Nielsen and this has come on the back of building brands as also the fastest distribution growth,” said TCP. On the other hand, witnessing a fall in counter sales of around 30% compared to its pre-Covid level, big loose tea retailers in India are going online, unveiling more owned or franchised touch points, taking up social media marketing and reaching out to customers through tele-calling, Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram and offering tea with promotions and discounts. Souvari Modak, operational head of Dhrubo Tea Centre, one of the largest-selling tea counters in the country, believes that quality improvement and business efficiency can only bring back around 10% of the lost offline customers, mostly aged ones, who believe in trust factors. “The rest 15-20% will never come and stick to the easy online mode of home-delivered tea. Lack of Covid-safe transport is the prime reason for this. Whole distribution channel and manpower situation for the offline tea business have gone haywire,” said Modak. According to plantation major Goodricke, which sells 14 million kg tea annually in loose as well as packaged formats, quality uplift and exclusivity can rein in the constant dip in demand for loose tea. “Buyers are going for packaged tea because they feel it is hygienic and has a shelf life. Post-pandemic the demand for health and immunity booster teas like ginger, tulsi, turmeric, cinnamon, etc — which are only available in packets — have gone up. Thus, everyone in the packaged tea industry and even the loose tea retailers have jumped on this health bandwagon. But packaged tea rates are still low in India vis-a-vis in various other countries,” said Goodricke MD & CEO Atul Asthana. In the loose tea market, good quality Assam and Dooars CTC prices had gone up by 10-15% during the last 18 months, while Darjeeling orthodox didn’t shine at all with just around 2-5% jump in rates, industry sources said. Prices of loose tea, which had gone up during the pandemic, have now come down drastically. “As things open up and normalise, the supernormal growths may taper. The category is expected to come back to a normative volume growth of 3-4% annually. The opportunity lies in value upgradation for the same volume,” said Krishnamurthy. Once loose tea players return to the market, would consumers go back to unpackaged tea? “Normally When consumers upgrade from loose to packaged tea, the stickiness is fairly high,” said Krishnamurthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tea-biggies-pack-a-punch-during-covid/articleshow/86820222.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Vijayawada||Cyclone shelters in Krishna offer frail relief||Vijayawada: The recent Cyclone Gulab has brought under the spotlight the sorry state of cyclone shelters across Krishna district. Except for a few, the majority of shelters have not been maintained and are in a dilapidated condition. As many as 76 of 185 shelters are in bad shape due to official apathy. After the cyclonic storm that hit the Diviseema region in 1977 and claimed around 10,000 lives, the government and voluntary organisations swung into action and constructed cyclone shelters in the nine coastal districts. A majority of these shelters were constructed in Krishna district, keeping in view the intensity of cyclones that hit the region. Cyclone shelters were built at Nagayalanka, Hamsala Deevi, Palakaya Thippa, Gollalamoda, Manginapudi, Gilakaladindi and other coastal, particularly with an eye on safeguarding the fisherfolk community. With some shelters being turned into community buildings, BC hostels and even government offices, fishermen expressed unhappiness with the turn of events and the condition of cyclone shelters. “We still remember the cyclone in 1996 when we all gathered in the shelter in our village. These shelters are constructed keeping in mind certain standards and such that they will not get inundated or damaged during extreme weather. We are fortunate that no big cyclone has hit the Machilipatnam coast in the last five years or else we would have run into problems,” said Kurokula Raja Rao, a fisherman from Palakayathippa. In some areas, cyclone shelters have become hubs for illegal activities in the absence of proper monitoring, said locals in Nagayalanka. “Cyclone shelters remain vacant throughout the year and they will be opened only during the cyclone warnings. Meanwhile, the miscreants are damaging the shelters and using them for illegal activities. We urge the government to convert these centres into multipurpose community halls,” said Dasari Rama Rao, a local of Gollalamoda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cyclone-shelters-in-krishna-offer-frail-relief/articleshow/86818968.cms||Venu Lanka

The protesters agreed to lift the blockade after Giriak block development officer (BDO) Nirmal Kumar and CO Alakh Niranjan Yadav paid their kin Rs 20,000 and promised to pay Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the kin of each deceased person soon.  Pawapuri OP incharge Shakuntala Kumari said, “Motorbike-borne Chhote Yadav of Beldaria village and his relative Arvind Kumar, a resident of neighbouring Nawada district, were on way to VIMS to attend a patient admitted there. When they reached near Daulatchak village, a speeding truck coming from the opposite side crushed them. While Chhote died on the spot, Arvind succumbed to his injuries during treatment at VIMS. The truck also overturned in a nearby roadside ditch. The driver of the vehicle somehow managed to escape.” Two run over by speeding train: In another accident, one Basukinath and her seven-year-old niece Suruchi Kumari, both residents of Khandak locality under the Biharsharif Town police station area were run over by Rajgir -Danapur passenger train at Biharsharif railway station.

---||Business||Rising crude gives markets jitters, pulls sensex down, rupee near 6-month low of Rs 75 per dollar||MUMBAI: Rising crude oil prices on Wednesday pulled down the sensex by 555 points to close at 59,190, weakened the rupee to near the 75-to-a-dollar level, a level not seen in the last six months and pushed up the yield on 10-year government bond to 6.28%, near to its 18-month high mark. The rising US government bond yield, fear of central banks’ liquidity support in several countries and withdrawal of funds by foreign funds also are making Dalal Street traders jittery. The day’s session on D-Street left investors poorer by Rs 2.5 lakh crore with BSE’s market cap now at Rs 264.9 lakh crore. At the close of the day’s session, 27 of the 30 sensex stocks closed in the red, BSE data showed. Wednesday’s session also witnessed foreign and domestic funds selling in tandem, something that is not seen regularly. BSE data showed that while foreign portfolio investors were net sellers at Rs 803 crore, the corresponding figure for domestic institutions was Rs 999 crore. According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, globally, equities tanked lower as risk sentiment soured amid growing worries over increase in government bond yield, rising inflation and soaring energy prices to multi-year highs. At near the $83-per-barrel level, the brent crude price was near the level last seen in September 2018. In recent months, the central banks in Russia and New Zealand have hiked benchmark rates. The RBI’s interest setting committee is due to announce its decision on rates on Friday. Although economists expect it to keep the benchmark repo rate (the rate at which RBI lends to banks) unchanged at 4%.  The RBI may hike the reverse repo rate (the rate at which it borrows from banks) to 3.5% from 3.35% now. The fallout of US debt ceiling limit not being raised by October 18 is also keeping global investors on the edge, market players said. The day’s session also saw the rupee falling to 75-to-a-dollar mark in intraday trade and close 43 paise weaker at 74.98. The day’s weakness in the domestic currency came on the back of rising crude oil prices and stronger demand for the greenback, Amit Pabari, MD, CR Forex, said. The depreciation of the rupee was aggravated after it was heard that domestic oil major ONGC was exploring to buy a minority stake (20-40%) in the $4-billion-plus Sangomar project offshore Senegal, Pabari said. A stake-buy by ONGC would mean outflow of dollar which in turn would mean weakness of the rupee. Moving forward, three key factors would determine the domestic currency’s trend: The US dollar index, price of crude oil and US benchmark bond yield. “As long as these are non-supportive, the momentum could take the rupee towards 75.3-75.5 levels. As volatility is back in the market, the RBI too could try to intervene and calm down the nerves any time,” Pabari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rising-crude-gives-mkts-the-jitters-pulls-sensex-down-rupee-near-6-month-low-of-75/articleshow/86820122.cms||---
---||Trichy||Central zone police put up warning boards at water bodies to prevent drowning incidents||Trichy: Taking a serious view of the frequent drowning incidents in waterbodies including the rivers in the central region of the state, the central zone police have started placing warning boards at the locations identified as dangerous in the nine districts.Identifying 268 locations including lake, pond, well and rivers in the central zone, police put up warning boards at 110 places as on Wednesday. The remaining places will be covered in a few days. Volunteers will be roped in to join hands with police to rescue victims and create awareness at such locations. Central zone comprises Trichy rural, Karur, Pudukkottai, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts. Each district will have a 10-member police team trained in disaster management and rescue to be deployed in the rescue operations. Going by the data released by the central zone police led by inspector general of police, V Balakrishnan, the drowning incidents claimed the lives of 235 people including several children in 2021 alone in the nine districts. A few recent incidents of children drowning in Karur and Thanjavur districts prompted the top cop of the central zone to act swiftly on the issue to bring down the loss of lives. On September 25, two girls aged 13 years from Shenbagapuram near Ammapettai in Thanjavur district drowned in a lake in the village. While one of the girls stepped into the lake and slipped in, another girl attempted to save her, but both drowned. The second tragedy happened at Sivalingapuram in Krishnarayapuram taluk in Karur district on September 30. Two boys aged 13 years and 12 years from the village drowned in a pond when they attempted to rescue goats from the pond. The analysis of the police department gave them an idea that the incidents of drowning were the consequences of taking bath in the Cauvery and other rivers, lakes and ponds. Recalling the drowning at Ammapettai area, IGP Balakrishnan said that there were incidents of drowning caused by mining in the waterbodies. “The drowning of the two girls was sort of one such incident. The presence of the warning boards will alert people and prevent the incidents,” IGP told ToI. While alerting people to be cautious at such locations, police also warned illegal sand miners not to plunder the waterbodies making them dangerous. Not only in the rural areas, waterbodies in the urban areas also witness such incidents. An 18-year-old boy from Varaganeri in Trichy was washed away in the strong flow of water at Oyamari bathing ghat in the Cauvery in Trichy on September 19. Since then the Fort police and the fire and rescue service personnel were searching for him in vain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/central-zone-police-put-up-warning-boards-at-water-bodies-to-prevent-drowning-incidents/articleshow/86820716.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Two men of the house left for work without closing the door while a woman was busy helping her son in his online class in one of the bedrooms. Meanwhile, the open house welcomed the thief, who smoothly decamped with valuables worth Rs 1.5 lakh. According to the complainant Kamran Sulemani, after he left for his job around 8.45 am on Tuesday, his father Kamil Hussain, who owns a stationery shop, too, left the house. Sulemani’s wife Bilqis was with their son Rehman in the bedroom for his online classes, so she did not realize that the house was open. Between 9.15 am and 10.30 am, a thief quietly walked into Sulemani’s house and went to the bedroom where the safe was kept. The thief managed to easily open the safe and found a box in which Rs 25,000 cash and gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 1.2 lakh were kept. He quickly took the box and was looking for some more valuables when Sulemani’s domestic help reached their home as per her daily routine at 10.30 am. The domestic help went with a broom in the same bedroom where the thief was. However, neither of them would have expected each other there, so both were startled. The thief barged out of the house and the domestic help shouted after which Bilqis came out of her room. By the time the help narrated what had transpired, it was too late as the thief had exited the building. Later, Bilqis called Sulemani to inform him about the theft and he lodged a complaint at Wadi police station. “We have questioned people around the house whether anyone had seen the thief or not, but we have not found any clue. There are no CCTV cameras in the building, but we are examining footage of cameras installed in the neighbourhood,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/thief-reaps-rich-dividends-from-open-invitation-in-pratapnagar/articleshow/86818670.cms||---

He plans to train his students to become dedicated teachers for blind persons. These three achievers, who fought physical, social and financial odds, were felicitated by an eye-hospital chain on Wednesday evening. “This award is a humble attempt to honour the visually impaired individuals and organizations who overcame their apparent problems to become heroes. They have made a mark of their own with their accomplishments and have inspired others,” said Debasish Bhattacharya, chairman and MD, Disha Eye Hospitals. Born in a village in Karnataka, Kempa faced difficulty reading the blackboard, before having to drop out in when he completely lost his vision in the fourth standard. A relative admitted him to a blind school in Mysore, and he eventually cracked the UPSC in the third attempt. He ranked 340 in 2016 and is now the additional DM of West Midnapore. Born without vision, Tarak Chandra had his friends read out text books that he recorded, passing both Madhyamik and HS with flying colours. He completed his Masters in history and his BEd. Then he cracked SSC and started teaching.  Sarkar, principal of Helen Keller Smriti Vidyamandir, received his award along with a student, Susmita Khatun. “Apart from imparting education, our school’s aim is to provide a space for our students in mainstream society.

The power demand in state is around 9,800 MW while maximum supply has been 9,175 MW. PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said, “Yes, there is coal shortage, but it is across the country. We are left with three days of coal stock.” Punjab purchased 1,260 MW from power exchange in this lean period, while generation is about 775 lakh units, which are 40% of the total demand of about 1,835 lakh units in the state. Earlier during the paddy season, the power demand had exceeded 13,000 MW. Sources revealed that two units of Rajpura thermal, Goindwal thermal and Talwandi Sabo plant generated power on Wednesday. In the public sector, three units at Lehra Mohabbat and two at Ropar thermal generated power. The dwindling coal stock at thermal plants across the country is posing a severe power shortage problem. With the steady increase in industrial power demand during the last two months, generation at thermal plants has dipped as coal stocks in more than half of them have become very critical. “Thermal power stations, which produce over 70% of the electricity consumed in the country, had an average of four days’ fuel stock. As per CEA report, there was no coal at 16 thermal plants and 25 have been left with only a day’s stock. There are another 34 plants with just three or four days of stock. The remaining 17 plants have stock for five and six days,” said a spokesperson of power engineers federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/threat-of-power-outage-punjab-thermal-plants-left-with-3-day-coal-stock/articleshow/86820719.cms||---

The petition was filed late evening on Wednesday. According to the cause list of the Bombay HC, a writ petition has been filed by Naik Naik and Co on behalf of Adisri Commercial and others. Adisiri Commercial is listed as a promoter of Srei Infrastructure with 60% stake in the company. The petition will come up for hearing on Thursday. The RBI had superseded the boards of the company citing governance issues and other lapses. An RBI-appointed administrator assisted by a three-member advisory committee has already taken charge of the company. Responding to the RBI action a spokesperson for the company on behalf of the promoters expressed shock by the RBI’s move as banks have been regularly appropriating funds from the escrow account they have controlled since November 2020. Moreover, we have not received any communications from banks on any defaults. “We had submitted a proposal to pay the full amount to banks under a scheme filed under Section 230 of the Companies Act 2013 in October 2020. However, they have neither accepted the scheme nor proposed a payment schedule acceptable to them,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We are also surprised because the NCLT order for all creditors is still in process. There is also an order for “no coercive measures” by the creditors and/or regulators. We will take all necessary steps as advised by our lawyers in this regard,” the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/srei-promoters-move-hc-against-rbi/articleshow/86820408.cms||---

---||Business||Zee moves tribunal against NCLT order on Invesco plea||Reeba Zachariah & Swati Deshpande | TNN Mumbai: Zee Entertainment Enterprises on Wednesday approached the appellate tribunal, seeking a stay on a lower court’s order that had set an October 7 deadline for the company to reply to a petition filed by largest shareholder Invesco. Zee said it needed more time to file a “comprehensive response” before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and hence approached the higher forum. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) will hear the matter on Thursday. In its appeal, Zee said the NCLT proceedings related to Invesco’s petition should be stayed till the appellate tribunal decides on its request. The legal fight between Invesco and Zee emerged after the former, a long-time investor of the company, sought to unseat Punit Goenka from the MD’s position. Separately, Zee had filed a civil suit before the Bombay HC asking it to declare Invesco’s request as invalid on grounds that it suffered from multiple legal infirmities. The matter is yet to be listed for hearing. Zee approached the Bombay HC as the broader statutes come under the latter’s jurisdiction as compared to specific ones like company law that is dealt by NCLT. In a TV interview on Wednesday evening, Zee founder Subhash Chandra raised doubts over Invesco’s intention for a board reshuffle at the company. Chandra said the fund does not want to remove Goenka (referring to his son and Zee MD) or change the board but “it wants to take over the company in a clandestine manner”. “Have they done any deal with any particular party for taking over Zee?,” asked Chandra. “Invesco should come out transparent on this and it or the party should make an open offer for Zee and let the company’s 2.5 lakh shareholders decide whether they want to take the deal of Invesco or Sony’s.” Zee had proposed a merger with Sony Pictures Networks which will give the Japanese giant a majority stake in the combined entity and the Chandra family will hold a significant minority share. Goenka will be the MD of the merged entity for five years. “Zee would be ready to call for a special shareholders’ meet to remove Goenka provided Invesco brings its deal on the table. If shareholders ask him to go, he will go. In fact, last year, the shareholders only voted him to continue as MD for another five years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-moves-tribunal-against-nclt-order-on-invesco-plea/articleshow/86820468.cms||Reeba Zachariah

With this clearance, the company will now be able to issue units of InvIT to key lenders including SBI, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank. The InvIT had already received final registration from Sebi and all other requirements to form the InvIT are in place. The sale of road assets through the InvIT route will address the group’s debt to the extent of Rs 9,214 crore. An IL&FS spokesperson confirmed the development. “The valuation presents a significantly improved recovery for the creditors of these SPVs as well as group companies who have provided debt to these SPVs,” the spokesperson said. Banks have already written off most of their debt to the IL&FS group as it was classified as a non-performing asset. By floating the InvIT they will receive units that will be backed by cash flows from the road projects. This will add to the bottom-line of the lending banks. The InvIT comprises six road projects — Barwa Adda Expressway, Baleshwar Kharagpur Expressway, Sikar Bikaner Highway, East Hyderabad Expressway, Moradabad Bareilly Expressway and Jharkhand Road Projects Implementation Company. The valuation of Rs 9,214 crore was determined by an independent valuer appointed according to Sebi InvIT regulations. IL&FS has proposed to resolve more than Rs 16,000 crore through InvIT in phases. This approval by NCLT for phase-1 is part of the said process. In the second phase, the group plans to add five road assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-gets-nclts-nod-to-sell-road-projects-via-invit/articleshow/86820326.cms||Mayur Shetty

It also added another 10 year-sentence for causing the death of the unborn child. Additional district and sessions court judge Tomy Varghese convicted Mohammed Sharif (42) from Vettichira for the murder of Ummu Salma (26), Mohammed Dilshad (7) under IPC Section 302. Also he was convicted under IPC 316 (causing death of quick unborn baby) and for trespass in connection with the crime that took place on May 22, 2017. The judge directed that Sharif will first serve the 10-year jail term for the death of the unborn baby whom he had fathered as per DNA test report. He will then undergo the double life imprisonment, which can be served concurrently along with the five-year term for trespass. Sharif was ordered to pay a fine of Rs 2.75 lakh, failing which he will have to undergo an additional prison term of two years and three months. Additional public prosecutor C Vasu said Ummu Selma (a divorcee) and Sharif (a building contractor who was married with three children), were in a live-in relationship after she entrusted the construction of her house to him. Vasu said the woman was murdered at her home on the day she was to be admitted to the hospital. Her expected date of delivery was May 25, 2017. According to the prosecution, Sharif planned to kill her thinking that if she gave birth to his illegitimate child, it would bring disrepute to him and family. He strangulated her and the boy, slit the veins in their wrists to make it look like a suicide. The murder came to light couple of days later after neighbours checked on them on experiencing a stench. The accused was arrested on June 4 on the basis of investigation headed by Valanchery inspector KM Sulaiman based on the phone calls of the woman. “Sharif had kept their relationship a secret. He used the mobile phones of the migrant labourers whom he employed. Even on the day of the murder, he had called her from the another phone asking her to get ready and that he was coming in an auto,” Vasu said. The accused had raised the claim in the court that Ummu Selma had committed suicide after murdering her son. However the prosecution cited the perfect cut made in the hand of the deceased which was unnatural in the case of a suicide and other circumstantial and scientific evidence to prove that it was a murder.  Earlier on Wednesday, Sharif attempted suicide by cutting his vein and was admitted to Palakkad district hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/man-gets-double-life-term-addl-10-year-sentence/articleshow/86820765.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||At 9.2 Mbps, Gujarat 7th in download speed||AHMEDABAD: Even as the IT industry in Gujarat is expanding its services and workforce to cash in on the post-pandemic digital boom, consistent internet speed and connectivity seems to be a challenge. With 9.2 megabytes per second (Mbps), Gujarat circle ranks seventh among all Indian states when it comes to the minimum download speed for wireless data connectivity. Gujarat lags behind Karnataka (with minimum download speed of 17 Mbps), Delhi (10 Mbps) and Mumbai (9.5 Mbps), where tech industry and start-ups have a strong presence. The state’s minimum download is lower than even Kolkata, Rajasthan and Odisha circles. Online education, work from home and increased streaming services have pushed up the requirement for bandwidth, which is set to grow further in days to come. If the internet speed remains low, it is expected to be a bottleneck in times to come, said industry stakeholders. Industry players also explained that many users working from home use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) which reduces the internet speed available. “Professionals working from home widely operate on VPN due to which available internet speed reduces to one-tenth. With digital consumption growing on both professional and individual fronts, a multi-fold surge in minimum bandwidth requirement will emerge over the coming years. Improving speed and ensuring a consistent connectivity is therefore inevitable,” said Ravi Pathak, CEO, Tatvic Analytics. Jaimin Shah, co-chair, Assocham – Gujarat state council, said, “The IT industry in Gujarat is clearly on an expansion mode after the digital boom that it saw post pandemic. Part of the workforce in the IT sector and several other sectors continues to work from home, making the internet an inevitable requirement, which is not consistently fulfilled. Even though companies offer broadband internet to their employees working from home, serviceability of broadband connections is an issue in certain localities where they must depend on wireless data connectivity, which is often inconsistent.” “Internet is now basic infrastructure for companies as well as professionals working out of home and therefore, improving its speed and consistency in connectivity is necessary,” Shah further said. “Several tech startups are also mushrooming across Gujarat, riding on the digital boom as well as growing interest of investors. Major IT firms are partially looking towards Gujarat for setting their base and therefore, demand is growing exponentially, thus fuelling the requirement for a greater bandwidth,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-9-2-mbps-guj-7th-in-download-speed/articleshow/86819979.cms||Niyati Parikh

Jha told TOI over phone that there was nothing like a friendly fight between Congress and RJD on the two seats. “Don’t term it as a friendly fight. Call it a proper fight. All the political parties contesting this election will be fighting with the aim to win,” said Jha. When asked whether this byelection will lead to the RJD and Congress parting of ways, Jha replied, “We don’t know the future of this alliance.” He further said they had contested the 2020 assembly election under the leadership of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and the latter would have become the chief minister had we won. “However, he (Tejashwi) or his party cannot take decisions on behalf of other parties,” he added. Backing Jha’s claim, Anand Madhab, who is heading the Congress team looking after the strategy and planning for the elections, criticised RJD for neglecting the alliance dharma. “One who is against you in the battle is your enemy. We have learnt from the Mahabharata that even relatives in the battlefields are foes,” he said. Earlier, the RJD state president had said one who has the support of majority takes the decision and his party was playing the role of big brother in the grand alliance. However, he also said the alliance is intact. Singh even hit out at the opposition NDA for being divided over the demand for the caste census issue. Lalu may visit Patna before bypolls: RJD founder Lalu Prasad is supposed to reach Patna at least five days before the assembly byelection and address rallies in both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan constituencies. “The final schedule is yet to be prepared, but he is expected to hold one rally in each of the two assembly constituencies on October 26 and 27,” said a senior RJD leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-friendly-fight-with-rjd-cong-contesting-for-victory/articleshow/86819291.cms||Sheezan Nezami

But in a circular sent on Wednesday, the council made it clear it preferred kids to take the November-December tests at school. Irrespective of where the exam is taken, it will be app-based and online and students will get their MCQ question papers on their devices, where they will have to answer. The circular, signed by council chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon, also explained the kind of invigilation schools should arrange for and asked them to submit details of the smart devices that each candidate would use for the exam. “While the preference would be to take the examination at school with parents’ consent, it could also be taken from candidates’ homes,” Arathoon said. Each school will have to arrange for at least one invigilator for every 25 candidates and one buffer proctor per 50 candidates. At the most, three buffer invigilators need to be assigned per school. “Proctors are basically school teachers who have taught in the chalk-and-talk method all through. But the demands of the board exam are different and unless teachers are trained adequately, they will be prone to making mistakes,” said a school head. Schools will also have to arrange for one IT-support executive for every 100 candidates. On October 7, the council will activate a link, where schools will have to send details of proctors, buffer proctors and IT support staff. The list needs to be uploaded by October 12. Candidates have the choice of using laptops, desktops, tablets or smartphones, which should have a camera and a microphone, the circular says. Schools have to mention the name of every registered candidate and the kind of device he or she would use. “We have to send the details by October 18,” said a school head.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisce-prefers-1st-sem-exams-in-schools/articleshow/86819885.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

As per a village-level study by the Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority, 692 coastal villages have been identified as vulnerable to cyclones and storm surges of varying degrees. As many as 337 villages on this list are located within two kilometres from the coastline, while the remaining are situated between two to five kilometres from the seashore. About three million people are vulnerable to cyclones as they are living within a five kilometre radius from the sea. The recent very severe storms like ‘Hudhud’ and ‘Titli’ are examples of how the cyclones will leave a trail of destruction behind after the landfall. The population of coastal cities in the state is increasing at a rapid pace due to employment and economic opportunities and infrastructural facilities. This further highlights the need of enforcing appropriate zoning regulations in the coastal areas to minimise the impact of intense weather systems. Nearly 60 cyclones hit the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh in the last five decades, causing damages to the tune of about Rs 87,000 crore. As per an earlier IMD’s report, which is prepared based on the frequency of cyclones, Nellore, Krishna, and East Godavari have been categorised as districts very highly prone to cyclones. Some of the remaining coastal districts are classified as highly prone districts. There are four major landfall points in the state, from Pulicat in Nellore and Machilipatnam in Krishna to Konaseema in East Godavari and north coastal Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh coast is the second-most cyclone affected Indian region after Odisha and has the second-largest vulnerable region to floods after Kerala. Sai Praneeth, a weather blogger who is popularly known as Andhra Pradesh Weatherman on social media, said that the majority of the cyclones originated in the Bay towards the end of September and the first half of October are crossing the coast either in north coastal Andhra Pradesh or South Odisha. “Intense weather systems like cyclones generally do not form in September. But as per the existing data, the cyclones brewing in September are hitting north coastal Andhra Pradesh. After October, the cyclones mostly affect south coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, etc.,” said Sai Praneeth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/three-million-at-risk-from-storms-along-aps-cyclone-prone-coast/articleshow/86818958.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

He urged Modi to direct the Union minister of fertilizers and chemicals in this regard. Gehlot wrote that 4.50 lakh metric tonnes of DAP were approved by the Centre for Kharif-2021 (April 1 to 30 September 2021) for Rajasthan. But only 4.35 lakh metric tonnes allotted, only 3.07 lakh metric tonnes were supplied to Rajasthan. In such a situation, the supply of 1.28 lakh metric tonnes from the Centre fell short against the sanctioned quantity. The CM said in the letter that the demand of 1.50 lakh metric tonnes was approved by the Centre for October 2021, but only 67,890 metric tonnes of DAP has been allotted in the month-wise allocation. Thus, there will be shortfall of 2.10 lakh metric tonnes of DAP including 1.28 lakh metric tonnes of short supply and a shortfall of 82,000 metric tonnes in the month of October. Gehlot apprised the Prime Minister that in Rabi 2021-22 (October 2021 to March 2022) about one crore hectare area is likely to be sown in Rajasthan. Out of this, sowing of mustard in 30 lakh hectare area and gram in 20 lakh hectares will start from September and will continue till the middle of October. Due to widespread rainfall in the state in the month of September, further increase in crop sowing area is expected, for which minimum three lakh metric tonnes of DAP will be required. Presently only 80,000 metric tonnes of DAP are available with Rajasthan, which is being consumed for Kharif crops. In such a situation, due to non-availability of DAP in sufficient quantity with the state for the Rabi season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-2-5l-mt-of-fertiliser-from-centre-for-raj/articleshow/86820747.cms||---

The July-September quarter has set a new record with the value of credit card transactions expected to have crossed Rs 2 lakh crore. According to payment industry officials, as transactions in September have matched or surpassed August, the total transactions for the quarter would be in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore. Banks are expecting the spending spree to continue because of coordinated online and offline sales coupled with further opening up of travel and hospitality. October could see a new monthly record in credit card spends at Rs 80,000 crore, according to banks. Spending on credit cards had taken a severe hit during the first nine months of the pandemic between (March 2020 to December 2020) with spending on debit cards outstripping credit for this period. October has begun with a bang thanks to the reopening of malls and online sales. “Spending picked up in August with the festivals. Usually, September is muted but this year we saw a 50% increase over last year despite there being a shraadh period when spending is muted,” said Kush Mehra, president, Pine Labs, a merchant platform for payments. According to him, there are multiple factors at work. “What is driving up volumes is that the size of the shopping cart has increased. There has also been a record deployment of point-of-sale terminals in smaller towns. We are planning to add 30,000 terminals in a month. The average ticket size has gone up because of the ‘buy now, pay later’ option on cards and we have seen 2x growth in our BNPL programme,” he said. Innoviti, another payment solution provider for big-box retailers across the country, was taken aback by the surge in-store sales last weekend despite the shraadh period. “Volumes were 17-18% higher than September pre-shraadh,” said Rajeev Agarwal, CEO, Innoviti. “One insight we received was that the media campaigns by e-commerce giants were resulting in increased walk-ins into retail showrooms and many were able to convert the customers,” he said. According to Mehra, while travel and hospitality payments are still low, this could be one of the reasons for the higher consumer spending in shops. “With travel not opening up, many are using the money set aside for holidays to buy stuff,” he said. Parag Rao, head of payments, consumer finance, digital banking and IT at HDFC Bank said on Tuesday that the bank has seen a significant revival on the ground. “Our range of festive offers on credit cards is not just about coming back with a bang but also about spurring India’s consumption story,” said Rao. Total credit card transaction values are increasing because of an increase in the number of cardholders as well as an increase in average spending per card. The average spending on a credit card was Rs 11,939 in January 2020 before the pandemic, after slipping to a record low of Rs 3,636 in April 2020 it rose gradually to hit a high of Rs 11,655 crore in March 2021. However, the second wave of the pandemic brought down average spending per card to below Rs 10,000 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, with the ebbing of the second wave and increase in vaccinations, the average spend per card hit a record Rs 12,158.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/credit-card-spends-hit-rs-2-lakh-crore-high-in-q2/articleshow/86820265.cms||Mayur Shetty

The 14-year-old deceased is the daughter of an apartment watchman and a native of Vizianagaram district. Police initially suspected it to be an accident case, but registered a case of suspicious death after noticing the deceased’s femur bone was fractured and severe injuries on her head. Six bachelors living in the apartment were taken into custody and police are retrieving deleted call records from the deceased’s father’s mobile. The girl, who was a class VIII student, went missing on Tuesday night. Sources said the girl had gone to the apartment, which is next to the one in which her father works. “We are investigating why the girl went inside that apartment,” police told the media. Police are also probing the murder angle. Apart from her femur bone, it is likely that some injuries were inflicted with a sharp-edged weapon, such as a blade. Sources in the police department said as per preliminary reports, one of the six bachelors in the apartment had entered into a relationship with the girl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/14-yr-old-found-dead-in-neighbours-apartment/articleshow/86819045.cms||Siva G
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Ambulance drivers feted for Covid service||KOLKATA: As a teenager, Churki Hansda had done all kinds of odd-jobs, including being a nanny in Kolkata, to support her family. The hardships steered the tribal woman from a remote village in Birbhum to take up driving lessons. And, during the second wave of the pandemic, the 30-year-old Santhali had driven around Labhpur in Birbhum to deliver oxygen at doorsteps to those who needed it. On Wednesday, Hansda was among eight ambulance drivers felicitated by Covid Care Network (CCN) and Liver Foundation West Bengal (LFWB) who had roped them in for a joint initiative called Oxygen on Wheels. After her graduation, Hansda started working for an NGO called Suchona in Birbhum where she did accounting jobs and translated short stories for children in Santhali. She took up driving in 2014 when the NGO enrolled her. “During the second wave, when Monisha di, the principal of Labhpur Girls’ High School, told me that CCN and LFWB were looking for ambulance drivers to deliver oxygen concentrators to Covid patients, I just took up the task,” said Hansda, who received training in how to use oxygen concentrators. Similarly, in Howrah, Sonali Kundu donned her PPE kit every day to deliver oxygen concentrators to homes. “Hansda and Kundu set an example by not only taking up the assignment to drive for the Oxygen on Wheels project, but by also being so involved in their work,” said Parthasarathi Mukherjee, secretary, LFWB. The Oxygen on Wheels project would have three persons on board — the driver, a helper and a volunteer from CCN — while delivering oxygen. But during the peak of pandemic, CCN ran short of volunteers. That was when these drivers had to double up as volunteers and learn how to use and fix the oxygen concentrators, pulse oxymeters, and other devices. “We also felicitated six men, also ambulance drivers, for their commitment to the project,” said Satyarup Siddhanta, secretary, CCN. The others felicitated on Wednesday were Karttick Mondal, Manik Das, Avijit Gayen, Bikash Das, Purusottam Santra and Asha Mali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ambulance-drivers-feted-for-covid-service/articleshow/86819892.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Patna||‘Follow staggered timings for dispersal’||PATNA: Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Wednesday directed all the DMs and district education officers (DEOs) of Patna division to regulate the rush of students during the dispersal time and lunch break in schools. He said the school administration need to manage the crowd when children are taking their meals on school campus. The direction was issued to all private and government schools in Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and Kaimur ditricts on Wednesday after complaints received from some parents, whose wards are studying in private schools. A survey was also conducted and the complaints were found true. Agarwal said the school campuses become overcrowded during lunch break and dispersal, which is the violation of Covid-19 protocol. He directed the DMs and DEOs to ensure that schools follow the safety norms and keep a gap between each class for dispersal and lunch. “In order to maintain social distancing, every school will follow a different class time formula. Staggered timings or 10-15 minutes gap should be followed for dispersal of classes. The simultaneous dispersal of classes also causes traffic jam outside the schools. In order to avoid traffic congestion and crowding, schools can follow 15-minute interval between the dispersal of classes I to IV and classes V to VIII,” Agarwal said. He added: “School staff should remain at entry and exit points to ensure physical distancing when kids are leaving or entering the campuses. Besides, lunch break should be held in an open area or classroom with different time slots as well.” Agarwal said earlier schools were being opened with 50% attendance, but now all the schools are opening with full attendance under the new guidelines. “Therefore, there is a need for complete security and safety in schools. School premises and their vehicles should be sanitised properly. They should also educate children about Covid-19, so that there is no misconception among kids. The students should be motivated to wear masks all the time during classes. They should also be informed about the Covid from time to time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/follow-staggered-timings-for-dispersal/articleshow/86818417.cms||Faryal Rumi

A YSRC functionary, A Sridhar Reddy, moved a petition seeking to quash the case registered against him under sections 505(2) and 153-A. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel Chinmoy Pradip Sharma told the high court that the action of the accused did not constitute a crime under sections 505(2) and 153-A. Arguing on behalf of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), A Chennakeshavulu said the petitioner made serious comments on social media against the judiciary and judges of the high court on which they have collected evidence. He said the investigation was underway and sought time to file a counter affidavit. The high court allowed the request of the CBI and posted the matter for further hearing after Dasara vacation. The counsel for the petitioner sought interim relief from coercive steps like arresting the petitioner. Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy declined his request and said only notices will be issued to CBI to file counter affidavit. The CBI submitted a status report on the ongoing investigation to the division bench comprising Justice Joy Malya Bagchi and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi.

---||Patna||Unesco report: 2.2L teaching posts in govt schools lying vacant in Bihar||PATNA: A total of 56% (amounting to 2.2 lakh) teaching positions in government schools are lying vacant in Bihar, out of which 89% are in rural areas, which is the highest in the country as per the Unesco’s ‘2021 State of the Education Report for India: No Teachers, No Class’, released on the World Teachers’ Day on Tuesday. The state also struggles from poor student-teacher ratio. Based on the pupil-teacher ratio of 35:1, the total additional teachers requirement is found to be about 2,20,000. Presently, there are 5,84,327 teachers in 89,224 schools across the state, of which 85% teachers and 90% schools are in rural areas. The report revealed that 3,700 schools in the state are single-teacher institutions, mostly in rural areas. Bihar is also among the five states having low (40%) proportion of women teachers in the workforce. The report said Bihar’s policy of not deploying teachers within 15km of their villages has also affected the attractiveness of the teaching profession for women. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar told this newspaper on Wednesday that the department has started the process of recruitment of 94,000 teachers in elementary schools (classes I to VIII) whereas the recruitment process for filling 30,000 posts in secondary and higher secondary schools may begin soon. “After the two counselling rounds, we have got only 38,000 teachers for elementary classes. The problem is that we are not getting teachers in 50% of the seats reserved for women. These seats remain empty,” he said. “We will recruit teachers, make schools more attractive and add value to education. Subsequently, the number of students in schools rises, so will the number of teachers,” he added. Apart from the vacancies and pupil-teacher ratio, the report has also raised concern about the lack of infrastructure in schools, resources, internet bandwidth and efficiency of teachers. As per the report, around 1.32% teachers in higher secondary schools in the state are under-qualified, which is almost 1.1% higher than the national average of 0.22% and the second highest after Andhra Pradesh (2.2%). Among the underqualified teachers, about 16.16% are in pre-primary, 8.47% in primary, 12.95% in upper primary and 2.76% in secondary schools of the state. Of the 89,224 schools in Bihar, the availability of information and communication technology (ICT) labs in schools is only 2% while only 7% schools have internet connections. On the whole, prevalence of libraries in schools is as low as 32% though 72% of the schools received free textbooks from the state government. The availability of drinking water in schools is 99%, toilet for boys (96%), toilet for girls (97%), electricity (78%), all classes in good conditions (60%). Noted academician Prof N K Choudhary said it exposes the tall claims of the state government about development of education in Bihar. “In fact, there are miles to go before we reach the national average in respect of quality of teaching and proportion of pupil-teacher ratio. This impacts adversely the education of the children belonging to economically weaker sections. The state government should take appropriate steps seriously to overcome the problems in education sector,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unesco-report-2-2l-teaching-posts-in-govt-schools-lying-vacant-in-bihar/articleshow/86818313.cms||Faryal Rumi

While 1,800 buses will be deployed before the festival, 2,200 buses will cater to passengers after Dasara. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire festive season was washed out in 2020 whereas APSRTC operated more than 4,600 buses during 2019. This year, as the Covid-19 cases continue to decline and the situation is largely under control, the APSRTC is anticipating huge rush and planning to operate as many buses as possible. The Hyderabad route will get the maximum number of buses as usual. As many as 1,383 buses will be operated to and from Hyderabad before and after the festival. Apart from Hyderabad, the APSRTC is planning 277 special buses from Bengaluru and 97 buses will be operated from Chennai. The remaining 2,243 buses will be operated between the major cities within Andhra Pradesh. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, vice- chairman and managing director (VC&MD) of APSRTC, Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, said that the ticket prices in special services have been fixed at 1.5 times to the normal ticket prices. “APSRTC has been facing criticism for higher ticket prices since long but we appeal passengers to understand the practical difficulties being faced by us,” he said. Explaining the reason behind higher prices, Tirumala Rao said that the special buses will have to travel empty on one side with zero revenues. “With the present prices of diesel, we have to charge extra to meet the expenditure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/4k-spl-rtc-buses-for-dasara-rush/articleshow/86819072.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The main accused, 21, turned out to be the neighbour of the Class X girl who had been stalking her for a while. According to police, Sunil had proposed the girl just before the murder and had asked her phone number. But the girl, angry over the man’s repeated overtures, had slapped him. The accused then roped in his two friends, one of them a 15-year-old boy, to carry out the murder. After killing the Dalit girl, the accused remained in the village pretending as if nothing has happened, a police officer said. They also participated in protests of the family. The girl was allegedly waylaid by the accused last Thursday, who killed her and threw the body in a field. She was returning from coaching in Bulandshahr’s Khurja. A few villagers had claimed to have seen a man in ‘red shirt’ running from the spot which was the only clue the cops had. They initially detained a man on suspicion, but he was later released. When the body reached her home on Friday, it appeared that the entire village was wailing. Girls of the village cried and yelled before the camera, “Lock us up, don’t let us study, kill us." A senior police officer privy to the investigation told TOI that after putting over 300 phones on surveillance, tracing locations of phones near the crime spot and interrogating over 100 people, they managed to reach a 15-year-old boy who confessed to his crime and also shared the whereabouts of his two other friends who were part of it. “The main accused, Sunil, had proposed to the girl that day and had asked for her phone number. She slapped him instead. In the fit of rage, Sunil pushed her and she fell on a stone that hit her head causing her death. The three then also tried to strangulate her but fled from the spot as they found that she was already dead,” SSP Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-school-girl-whose-murder-sparked-protests-by-teens-killed-by-stalker-2-others/articleshow/86818281.cms||Ishita Mishra

The Dehradun resident’s wife, Ishrana Khatoon, has accused some of the officers of being negligent towards her husband when he fell ill. Meanwhile, the president of the state minority department RK Jain has ordered the district magistrate to form a committee to conduct an probe in this matter. One of the close relatives of the victim told TOI, “Mohsin had gone for an official tour with his two senior officers on August 15 to Udham Singh Nagar.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Corbett to be ‘reborn’ as Ramganga park?||DEHRADUN: The iconic Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand may be renamed as 'Ramganga National Park’ following a visit by Union minister of state for environment, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, who has sought a proposal in this regard from the state forest department. The park’s director, Rahul (who only uses his first name), told TOI on Wednesday that a proposal for the name change will be prepared after a discussion with relevant stakeholders. TimesViewRenaming has been part of a national political game for decades now. The talk of renaming Jim Corbett Park as Ramganga falls in the same category of appropriation. Jim Corbett was a legendary hunter turned conservationist and writer. Even today he remains a fond figure in the hills of Kumaon and Garhwal. It would be better if India’s first national park, in the founding of which he played a crucial role, retains his name.Between 1954 to 1956, the tiger reserve was called 'Ramganga National Park’ — after the Ramganga river that flows through it — before it was renamed in a tribute to noted hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett. When the park was first set up in 1936, it was known as Malcolm Hailey Park after the first Lt Governor of the United Provinces. Forest officials were accompanying the Union minister on Sunday when he visited the Dhangari museum to mark ‘Azadi Ka Mahotsav’ and later suggested that the park's name should be changed. A senior Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer, who was present during Choubey’s visit, said the minister learnt about Corbett’s old name during his visit to the museum and thought it accurately represented the river, Ramganga, which is the lifeline for many animals in the reserve. The park boasts of having the highest tiger density in the wild — at 14 tigers per 100 sq km — in the world. During his visit, Choubey wrote the park’s name as ‘Ramganga National Park’ in the visitors’ book kept in the museum. A copy of his note, which is with TOI, read: “Ramganga National Park (Corbett Tiger Reserve) is a place surrounded by natural beauty. Our endeavour should be to ensure protection of this national legacy…” A top source told TOI that Choubey has also discussed the matter with the minister of state for tourism and Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt who gave his in-principle consent. Conservationists, meanwhile, questioned the “futile” exercise, saying that the focus should be on preserving the ecology of the region. “At a time when we are seeing rampant chopping down of forests, construction of hydro projects in ecologically-fragile areas and submerging of valleys due to infrastructure works, why is the government’s focus a futile name-changing exercise?” said Kumaon-based historian and Padma Shri recipient Shekhar Pathak. Harendra Bargali, deputy director of Corbett Foundation, a private body, said the thrust should remain on conservation. Others questioned the need to obliterate Jim Corbett’s legacy. A senior scientist from the Wildlife Institute of India said, “Corbett was an ardent conservationist who led a paradigm shift in the wildlife conservation of India. The park rightly pays tribute to his immense contribution towards wildlife conservation in the country.” The naturalist passed away in 1955. His book, Man-Eaters of Kumaon, details his experiences hunting leopards and tigers in Kumaon between the 1900s and the 1930s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/corbett-to-be-reborn-as-ramganga-natl-park-after-union-mins-prod/articleshow/86818274.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||One of police witnesses in northeast Delhi riots case is lying on oath, says court||NEW DELHI: After passing a series of orders on glaring lapses in investigation in several northeast Delhi riots cases, a city court has now pointed out discrepancies in the testimony of police witnesses during trial. It said prima facie one of the witnesses was lying on oath during recording of evidence. Subsequent to recording of the prosecution evidence being complete, the court noted that head constable Sanoj had categorically stated on oath that he had identified three more rioters by their names as well as professions. On the contrary, ASI Ram Dass stated that the three accused could not be identified during investigation. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said, “Prima facie, one of the police witnesses is lying on oath punishable under IPC Section 193 (punishment for false evidence).” “Sanoj categorically asserted their presence at the spot at the time of riots. However, the investigating officer (IO) has admitted that there is nothing on record to substantiate that the matter qua aforesaid three accused persons was ever investigated despite their names being there on record,” said the court. The order added, “On the contrary, it is stated that the identity of these accused could not be established during investigation. There is no material on record that efforts were ever made by the IO to apprehend the said accused persons.” The court was also informed that the three people had been specifically named as accused by one Nisar Ahmed in another case, but even in that matter they had not been interrogated. “This is a very sorry state of affairs,” the judge observed. The judge directed the DCP concerned to file a report in the matter related to vandalism of properties on February 26, 2020 at Bhagirathi Vihar. Four people were booked in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-of-police-witnesses-in-riots-case-is-lying-on-oath-says-court/articleshow/86822591.cms||Usha Das
---||Dehradun||NTCA directs Uttarakhand to stop tourism in Rajaji core area||DEHRADUN: The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has directed the Uttarakhand forest department to shut down all tourism related activities in the core tiger habitat zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve until further notice, noting that the move was in violation of its guidelines. The forest department had kicked off tourism activities in a 19km stretch from Satyanarayan to Kansro, a critical tiger habitat zone, of Motichur range on October 1. The zone was opened for the first time to tourists and was supposed to allow visitors throughout the year. SC advocate Gaurav Bansal had sent a notice to the NTCA alleging that allowing tourism in this critical tiger habitat of Rajaji without following the “scientific criteria as well as without consulting the expert committee" was illegal. In September, the chief wildlife warden had directed the Rajaji authorities to open the 19km stretch for tourism purposes throughout the year. The NTCA had then sought a factual report from the forest department. On Wednesday, the NTCA directions to the chief wildlife warden, a copy of which is with TOI, read: “Through your communication you have informed that the core/critical tiger habitat zone is being used by Uttarakhand for tourism related activities but the move comes as violation of the above-mentioned (Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and National Tiger Conservation Authority Guidelines, 2012). Therefore, you must defer the activities in this area with immediate effect until further orders.” A copy of the order has also been sent to the director of the reserve. Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had announced in June that all the zones of Corbett and Rajaji would be opened for tourism round the year. Conservationists had disapproved of the idea saying that it wouldn't allow relaxation or breeding time for the wild animals due to constant human interference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/national-tiger-body-directs-ukhand-to-stop-tourism-in-core-tiger-habitat-of-rajaji/articleshow/86818267.cms||Shivani Azad

In addition, the three upcoming jumbos at Kanjurmarg, Somaiya grounds and Malad that are being constructed by external agencies, will be completed too. Civic authorities believe that the threat of a third wave has not disappeared completely and the season of festivities that started from Ganpati and will continue till Diwali could cause a spurt. Collectively, jumbos are supposed to contain 20,000 Covid beds, of which 6000 beds are in the three upcoming centres. “A decision on the future of jumbos would be taken post the end of the year and if cases continue to remain under control,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. He said the Kanjurmarg and the Malad centres that are being constructed by CIDCO and MMRDA, respectively, will be completed shortly. The new centres will be commissioned only in phases. “We will have them as backups for now,” he said. Sources said the cost of running these centres range from Rs 1crore to Rs 3 crore per month. The six existing jumbos built in the first phase, BKC in Bandra, Nesco in Goregaon, Richardson and Cruddas centres in Mulund and Byculla, Kandarpada in Dahisar, NSCI in Worli, had nearly 10,000 beds. Some of these were renovated this year and over 3,000 beds were added, including paediatric ones. The six and SevenHills, Andheri, together have handled over 70,000 Covid admissions.. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco facility, said she has less than 100 patients in a facility with over 2,000 beds. The 206-bed ICU is largely empty. “Still, I am in favour of keeping them for a longer time. The demand for beds shot up overnight in the second wave and we had 1,800-2,000 hospitalisations daily,” she said. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC, said they have commissioned only 228 beds out of 2,300 and have 38 patients. The second wave had appeared and peaked in two months. “Building an ICU, or a ward with oxygen beds, takes a month or more. We can’t be building hospitals when the storm is on the doorstep,” Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of Dahisar jumbo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-covid-19-jumbo-centres-coming-despite-thin-demand/articleshow/86822621.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Meena claimed Parashar was appointed as a coordinator of the examination despite being a retired lecturer. “All other 32 districts had government employees as coordinators. Only Jaipur had a retired professional, who hired four others to assist him,” said Meena. He said, “Exam centres are generally booked by the government, but in this case, the arrangements were made by a third party.” He said the question papers were transported, unloaded and distributed by people who were outsourced. “In Jaipur, three exam centres were blacklisted, but later made REET centres,” said Meena. The MP feared that Batti Lal Meena, the mastermind of the scandal, would never be found. “A lot of secrets will be revealed if Batti Lal Meena gets caught. Many Congress leaders will be exposed too. Hence, I demand CBI probe into the matter,” he said. Despite repeated attempts, Jaroli could not be reached for comments as his phone was switched off. The MP said he will meet the party higher-ups in Delhi to schedule a state-wide protest against the scandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rbse-chief-jaipur-coordinator-involved-in-reet-leak-meena/articleshow/86820773.cms||---

Transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said complaints of private buses operating without tax were continuously pouring in, so special investigation teams of the department were constituted. During raids in four districts — Faridkot, Bathinda, Amritsar and Ludhiana — 15 buses were impounded. Speaking to TOI, Warring said, “I had instructed the transport department officials to check buses not meeting norms, like either not paying taxes or not having proper permits or making more rounds than permitted. The department officials on Wednesday impounded a number of buses of various transport companies from Bathinda, Faridkot, Amritsar and Ludhiana. I have come to know that alerted about the impending action, one of the transport companies deposited Rs 55 lakh as tax. Others may follow suit but we will check tax evasion.” Two buses each of Jujhar Bus Service and New Deep have been impounded in Faridkot. Similarly, two buses of New Deep, one of Orbit Aviation and one of Rajdhani Bus Service were impounded in Bathinda. Orbit Aviation is owned by the family of SAD president Sukhbir. Two buses of Baba Budha Transport Service owned by the SAD leader Nirmal Singh Kahlon have been impounded in Amritsar. One bus of Orbit Aviation, two of Jujhar Bus Service owned by Gurdeep Singh and one each of Libra Bus Service and Nagpal Bus Service have been impounded in Ludhiana district. Sources in the transport department said buses of influential transporters took lucrative time slots and even got more parking time at bus stands as compared to those of public transport buses. After taking charge, Warring had got a kiosk of Orbit removed from Bathinda bus stand. Warring had contested assembly polls against SAD’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Hardeep Singh Dimpy Dhillon of New Deep transport. Dhillon has termed it a part of vedenta politics. “We have certain conditions for depositing tax and are ready to deposit it when they are fulfilled. No other norms is being violated by us,” claimed Dhillon. Sources said the minister has specially targetted the family-owned buses of Badals and Dhillon. He had been claiming for long that if given a chance he would look into buses being run by transport companies owned by the two families. The minister said any person violating the rules of the department would not be spared at any cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/15-buses-plying-illegally-impounded-in-punjab/articleshow/86820782.cms||Neel Kamal

Police arrested the Oorgattiri native under IPC section 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) on the dowry harassment complaint filed by his wife Hiba. She had said that Hameed and family were torturing her over insufficient dowry. He was nabbed by the police from the home of a relative at Kuniyil near Areacode in Malappuram. Meanwhile, Wandoor police — which had initially registered a case of unnatural death over the suicide of Moosa Kutty — has invoked suicide abetment charges against Hameed and his arrest will be recorded in the case too. Police are also looking into the allegations that Hameed’s parents were also involved in the dowry harassment. Hiba had said that her father took the extreme step over the suffering and torture she had to undergo at the hands of her husband and his family. She had said that during her marriage, Moosa Kutty had given 18 sovereigns of gold, and after the husband and his family demanded more gold after marriage, six more sovereigns belonging to her mother were also given. Panthalingal native Moosa Kutty committed suicide by hanging himself on a tree in a rubber plantation near his house on September 23. In the video message recorded, Moosa was seen telling that his daughter Hiba has been suffering domestic violence at the house of her husband Hameed saying that gold ornaments provided to her during marriage were insufficient. He says that Hameed had said that he would not take Hiba back to his residence, after she came to her house on becoming pregnant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/son-in-law-held-in-dowry-case/articleshow/86820777.cms||---

Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Singh confirmed to TOI that Randhir Singh had surrendered in a local court. “The court has been issuing warrants and summons against Singh since 2017. In 2019, a non-bailable warrant was issued against him but he didn’t appear before the court. We announced a reward on him on Tuesday following which he surrendered.” The court has sent Singh to 14 days in judicial custody. The reward was announced shortly after after the Supreme Court had reprimanded the UP government for “shielding police officers” and slapped a fine of Rs 7 lakh on the state. Pradeep Kumar (19), a B Tech student from Secunderabad, Bulandshahr was going to Delhi to meet his aunt, when he was shot dead in an alleged staged encounter after a robbery in a roadways bus on August 3, 2002. The police team led by the then inspector of Secunderabad, Randhir Singh, was booked for murder on the direction of a local court, which had rejected a CB-CID report giving clean chit to the cops. Kumar’s father who had been pursuing the case for over 19 years approached the Supreme Court recently alleging tardy progress in the case. The apex court on September 30 said, “The laxity with which the state has proceeded in the present case speaks volumes of how state machinery is defending or protecting its own police officers…” The court added, “Normally, we are slow in entertaining petitions directly filed in this court but in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, we have entertained this petition to ensure that justice be given to the petitioner, which has been denied for about two decades.” Yashpal Singh, deceased’s father, said he was threatened by accused cops to take back the case, but he persisted. “I have already fought over two dozen cases in the Supreme Court and the high court to get justice for my son and I will continue to do so,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/missing-ex-cop-wanted-in-fake-encounter-surrenders-after-19-yrs/articleshow/86816628.cms||Ishita Mishra

The commission also recommended the government to initiate disciplinary action against the SI, in accordance with law.The commission made the recommendations on the complaint preferred by J Delphin against Shanthi, the then SI of Kanyakumari district crime branch police.In her complaint, Delphin stated that she was employed in a private company in Kanyakumari district for nine years. Believing the false promises made by the management, she had given Rs 3 lakh and three cents of land to the company in December 2012. When she came to know that she was cheated, she filed a complaint with the police, however, no steps were taken.Based on the instigation of the management, Shanthi came to her house in February 2013, asked her to come to the police station. When she asked for the reason, Shanthi allegedly assaulted her and took her to the police station and threatened her to withdraw the complaint. Delphin claimed that she was let go at 11pm. Since she sustained injuries, she was admitted at the government hospital.Denying all the allegations, Shanthi stated that she went to the house to serve her summons as a complaint was given against her by the director of the company.SHRC member A Chittaranjan Mohandoss said that the copy of the summons was not produced before the commission to prove Shanthi’s case. The commission said that the certificate issued by the doctor shows that the complainant sustained injuries.The commission said that Delphin has not made any complaint against any other officers. There is no specific motive for the complainant against Shanthi to implicate her complaint. Hence, the commission concluded that Shanthi had violated the human rights of the complainant and recommended the compensation and that the government may recover the same from Shanthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shrc-orders-1l-relief-to-woman-assaulted-by-cops/articleshow/86820775.cms||---

Last month, while hearing a petition, Delhi High Court asked SDMC to explain why unauthorised construction and encroachment had been allowed to come up in and around the graveyard. “We carried the survey and took details of the people occupying the stretch. They will be served notice soon and given opportunity for hearing subsequently. The whole process will be completed swiftly as the matter is sub judice and we need to submit an affidavit,” said an official, admitting presence of encroachments around the graveyard.

---||Dehradun||No mandatory deduction from pension for healthcare scheme, Uttarakhand govt tells HC||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Wednesday told the high court that there will be no mandatory deduction from the pension of its retired employees for a healthcare scheme. In an affidavit, the government told the court that the mandatory deduction of charges will be stopped from November. The submission by the state government came during the hearing of a petition, which had said that from January this year, the government had started deducting money from the pensioners’ account to provide them medical treatment under the Atal Ayushman Uttarakhand scheme. And that they were not given an option to opt out. The petitioner also cited a Supreme Court order, which said, “A pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the government” and “the right to pension is a valuable right vesting in a government servant.” The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed by Ganpat Singh Bist, who had joined the Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department in the year 1972 as a junior clerk and retired in 2011 as a senior administrative officer from Uttarakhand Public Works Department. He had claimed that earlier, the pensioners were governed by the UP Medical Attendance Rules 1946, where the facility of medical reimbursement of all bills was provided and no contribution was charged at government hospitals. In April 2012, the state government introduced the U-health card scheme for the government employees and pensioners for cashless treatment at empanelled hospitals, Bist said. “This was an optional scheme and could be availed on paying a yearly premium. But in 2018, the U-health cards were replaced with the Atal Ayushman Uttarakhand scheme. A premium of Rs 200 per month was also fixed for availing of the service.” Bist alleged that from January 1 this year, the newly-launched state government health scheme under the Atal Ayushman Yojna, was imposed on the pensioners without their consent and with hefty contribution rates, depending on their pay scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-mandatory-deduction-from-pension-for-healthcare-scheme-uttarakhand-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/86818305.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Refresher training mooted for teachers of classes I-VIII||MADURAI: With schools in the state set to reopen for classes I to VIII from November 1, teachers and students face an equal challenge while returning to the norm of classroom learning. Teachers hope to make classroom learning fun again to counter the new changes, including the huge gap of schools being shut and online classes influencing students’ behaviour and learning. “Children have been out of school for one and a half years and some are engaged in work with their parents. Students would have lost basic literacy skills too. In such case, we should act in a way that motivates them. Getting children to focus on basic reading and writing is first,” said M Porchelvan, district secretary, Tamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Koottani, Madurai. “Children’s basic habits and routine of even sitting in a classroom would have changed. We planned to tell teachers to focus only on engaging children in fun learning, talk to them kindly and cheer them up,” said S Sasithra, headmistress, Government Model Girls Higher Secondary School, Othakadai. K Saravanan, a government-aided primary school headmaster and zonal president, Child-Friendly Schools (CSF), said the school education department must provide refresher training for teachers. “Primary school teachers in particular need to be more dedicated and patient in handling students. Children are also more influenced by technology. Song and dance alone may no longer be a playway method to engage children in classrooms,” he added. Though private school students have been kept engaged with online classes, teachers said it will still be a challenge to get back the passion of learning in classrooms. “In online classes, though children are submitting assignments, we don’t know how far they have really learnt any subject. If their foundational knowledge is poor, it needs to be identified by engaging on one-on-one basis,” said L Shivashankari, a Class III teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/refresher-training-mooted-for-teachers-of-classes-i-viii/articleshow/86820781.cms||---

Although celebrations are being organised for Dandiya and Durga Puja, there will be a limit to people allowed inside the pandal and dandiya nights. Sheela Mata Temple at Amber will remain closed for worshippers as the administration hasn’t granted permission yet. City Palace coordinator Pramod Yadav said all rituals will be done inside the temple but no devotees will be allowed. Another big temple, Durga Mata Temple at Durgapura, will allow darshan from 20-feet away with 20 people at a time. No prasad or any offerings to the goddess will be allowed. Mahendra Bhattacharya, mahant of the temple, said if the administration decides to close the temple, they will abide. At Durga Bari, the oldest celebration for Durga Puja in Jaipur, the association has decided to limit people entering the pandal. Association member Swapan Guha said, “There will be a cap on the number of people. All the functions such as pushpanjali, sindur khela and other celebrations will be organised but people will be limited.” At SDM Park Durga Puja, only committee members will be allowed and no outsiders can enter the pandal. A small 2.5-feet idol has also been made by local artisans. Every year, Jai Durga Welfare Society at Vaishali used to celebrate Durga Puja in a grand way. This year, they will not build a pandal and in the temple hall, 50 people of the committee will be allowed every day for the celebrations. For Navratras, Dandiya nights will not be organised on any grand scale in the city. With a cap of 20 people, Dandiya will be organised at colony level. Ravindra Kumar at Raja Park is receiving request for Dandiya night tickets. “We will allow only 180 people at a time. This is a small celebration and nothing grand has been planned.” Kritika Sharma, owner of a Dandiya dress rental shop in Mansarover, said they have started getting orders for dresses. “This year business is good but not as compared to pre-pandemic period. Dress rental orders are being received for small events like celebrations in colonies with 50 people or in school celebration dresses for kids are rented. Very limited celebrations are organised,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/navratra-durga-puja-to-be-low-key-for-2nd-year-in-a-row/articleshow/86820826.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said there cannot be a general presumption concerning the violation of rights and privileges of persons who are being raided by any investigating agency, and in case of a grievance, the aggrieved party can approach the trial court or any appropriate forum. The court added that there were enough provisions under the law to govern how a search ought to be carried out and it saw no reason to issue any direction for searches by a “privilege team” with videography for advocates. “We see no reason to entertain the petition because it all depends on the facts and circumstances of a case. As a general rule, we are not inclined to pass an order on search by a ‘privilege team’ with videography. It ought to be kept in mind that raids are carried out to unearth several materials. Sometimes such material may be covered by privileged communications. (For aggrieved persons) remedies are available under law,” the bench observed. “We can’t presume in advance and such violation of rights must be established in law by proving basic facts,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rejects-plea-seeking-guidelines-for-raids-by-cops-on-lawyer-premises/articleshow/86820865.cms||---

The incident took place on September 26 when the entire Jaipur police were engrossed in organising the REET exam. According to DCP, Jaipur South, Harendra Kumar Mahawar, teams from five police stations laid two-tier cordons as soon as they received the complaint. TimesViewFor a state that tops in rape cases, the sentencing of a 25-year-old rapist in Jaipur within five working days after framing of charges, sets an important new milestone. The swift pace of investigation indicates that police can ensure justice when coordinated efforts are made. The case should not lull police into complacency. Instead, it should be made a precedent that could be followed in other equally heinous offences.“The girl was unconscious and the family was traumatized. We first spoke to doctors to shift her to a different hospital for better medical care. We also constituted a team of nearly 200 cops that fanned out on multiple fronts,” he said, adding that he spoke to the girl’s parents to assure them all possible help. The police arrested the accused on September 27 and carefully preserved all evidence for forensic examination. Mahawar said that sending samples for the forensic examination can nearly four days, but in this case, police ensured that samples were sent the same day. Mahawar said that the accused and the charge sheet was presented the same day before the court. “Children can not protect themselves, therefore, it was very important for us at a personnel level to send a message that could deter other offenders,” he said. Jaipur police said the experience during investigation will be used as Standard Operating Procedure for investigation in future cases involving crimes against minors. Police said the girl’s statements before court were also arranged through video conferencing. “There were multiple challenges like law and order, preserving evidence, safety of the girl, her parents and independent witnesses,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Another Wednesday spike: Mumbai records 624 Covid cases, max in 90 days; deaths up too||MUMBAI: The city recorded 624 cases on Wednesday, the highest in 90 days, even as the state (2,876) continued to register fewer than 3,000 cases for the fifth day in a row. After two days of registering two deaths each, the daily toll too rose to seven in the city. Fatalities in the state also jumped to 90 from 39 on Tuesday. “This could be the Wednesday effect that we have been noticing for some time now,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The Covid week in Mumbai has now acquired a distinct pattern – “lows” on Mondays and “highs” on Wednesdays. Last week, the lowest tally was 376 on September 27 (Monday) and the highest (525) was on September 29 (Wednesday). An explanation could be that the number of daily tests is higher on weekdays and drops on weekends: Monday’s tally, for instance, reflects the fewer tests on Sundays. On October 4, the tally was 341 after 28,223 tests conducted on Sunday. Wednesday’s high of 624 came from 39,569 tests the previous day. “We will closely monitor cases for the next two days to ascertain if there is any other cause for this increase,” said Kakani. The BMC has been testing people returning to Mumbai in higher numbers over the last few days. “The number of flyers being tested has gone up as air travel has opened too,” he said. In fact, the third batch of sequencing at the BMC’s new genomic laboratory will begin on Thursday with a sizeable sample taken from international flyers who tested positive. “We should have the results by Monday,” said Kakani. According to the weekly Covid report presented to the cabinet, the weekly growth rate of cases in the state has dropped to 0.04% and there are 11 districts with a growth rate higher than the state’s average.

A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and J K Maheshwari differentiated between ‘honourable’ and ‘mere’ acquittals, both terminologies emerging from judicial pronouncements as these do not find place in the criminal laws. It said an honourable acquittal is one where the courts record that the person has been falsely implicated and that there is absolutely no evidence to link him to the crime. However, a person is ‘acquitted’ for various other reasons including lack of sufficient evidence, benefit of doubt and prosecution witnesses turning hostile. The bench reversed concurrent judgments of the Madhya Pradesh HC directing employment to be given to a person who was acquitted in a kidnapping case because the prosecution witnesses turned hostile. The bench said it was not an honourable acquittal as the prosecution had alleged that the accused had indulged in physical violence against the witnesses, who in course of time turned hostile. Writing the judgment, Justice Maheshwari said, “If a person is acquitted giving him the benefit of doubt, from the charge of an offence involving moral turpitude or because the witnesses turned hostile, it would not automatically entitle him for the employment, that too in disciplined force.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/honourable-acquittal-must-to-join-forces-supreme-court/articleshow/86825414.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

According to sources, blackbucks that stray into revenue land in the forest areas in search of food are being hunted by poachers for their skin, meat, and horns. Poaching gangs became active and began targeting blackbucks after a lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. Raju Gondkar, range forest officer, Gadag said that two cases of blackbuck killing have been reported in the Gadag forest division limit in the last two months. On Monday, Gadag rural police nabbed three poachers who were transporting large quantities of meat. When questioned, they revealed that they had killed 2-3 blackbucks and were travelling to the neighbouring towns to sell the meat. When blackbucks stray into farmlands, people chase them back to the forest area. However, poachers target such blackbucks and kill them for personal gain.“The poachers lay traps in vulnerable points in the forest areas to catch blackbucks, and they also keep an eye on blackbucks that come to ponds and lakes to drink water,” he explained. “They pursue and kill the animals with razor-sharp weapons. They sell their skins and horns to poaching gangs in neighbouring states, sell the meat in the city for Rs 300 to 400 per kg. On Monday, three poachers were nabbed as a result of our vigil. In collaboration with local police, we have now increased our patrolling activities in the Gadag, Ron, and other surrounding forest areas. Following two cases reported from Kanaginhal village, we have increased our focus on this area by deploying more personnel to track down poachers,” he said.“We intend to hold massive awareness rallies and events to educate people living in forest areas to inform police about the movement of poachers, and send a strong message to poaching gangs that killing or hunting blackbucks will result in years of imprisonment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/forest-dept-intensifies-patrolling-to-protect-blackbucks/articleshow/86816814.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The Parishad has demanded that the role of the UP CM in the matter should also be probed. In the letter, the Parishad stated that the entire Gurjar community was “upset” because of the alleged defacing of the word on the plaque under Mihir Bhoj’s statue and claimed the local police hand in the incident. They have also demanded that the upcoming Noida airport at Jewar be named after the ninth-century ruler. “Ample police personnel were present near the statue of Samrat Mihir Bhoj because it was a programme of the CM. However, on the night of September 21, some leaders of the BJP colluding with the police officers spread ink on a part of the name of the Samrat Mihir Bhoj hurting the sentiments of the Gurjar community of the country,” the letter reads. TOI has access to a copy of the letter. “There should be a thorough probe into the incident and an FIR should be lodged against the guilty politicians and officials. The role of the UP CM, too, should be probed,” Ravindra Bhati, national president of the Akhil Bharatiya Gurjar Parishad, demanded. On Monday, the Parishad had submitted a written complaint against some unknown persons for allegedly defacing a part of the name of the ruler on the plaque ahead of the September 22 event. It had also demanded that action be taken against two police officers, including additional DCP Vishal Pandey and ACP Nitin Singh, for allegedly “misbehaving” and hurling “abuses” at some leaders of the Gurjar community who had arrived from other states after a video of the same went viral. Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar, meanwhile, told TOI that the controversy was over now. “The word Gurjar is there on the plaque now. The officers mentioned are both among the finest officers we have…For law and order maintenance, at times, one has to use the pleasing words and harsh words too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gurjar-body-writes-to-pm-seeks-probe-into-plaque-row/articleshow/86820984.cms||---

As part of these fresh investments, the company will be increasing its oil palm area under cultivation by around 31 times to 62,000 hectares in these two north eastern states over the next five years. In Arunachal Pradesh, the company will be increasing its cultivated area from 2,000 hectares to 30,000 hectares at an investment of Rs 750 crore over the next five years, creating about 3,000 jobs. Besides, 3F Oil Palm will also be commissioning an oil palm processing unit in AP by the next financial year. Meanwhile, in Assam, the company will be investing Rs 1,000 crore in bringing 30,000 hectares of land under cultivation and will generate employment for 2,000 people. It will be developing an integrated oil palm project comprising nursery operations, area expansion, crop maintenance, fresh fruit bunches (FFB) harvesting and collection, oil palm processing and refining, power plant, and ancillary farmer services in Assam as well. Currently, the company has contract oil palm plantations across Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh and Gujarat. Commenting on the development, Sanjay Goenka, managing director and CEO, 3F Oil Palm, said: “The new policy has encouraged us to expand... We are geared up to make strategic investments and expand operations to more states that offer immense potential in oil palm cultivation to maintain a leadership position in the oil palm industry in the country.”  Goenka pointed out that the increase in oil palm cultivation in the country will reduce our dependence on imports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/3f-oil-palm-to-pump-rs-1750-crore-in-oil-palm-cultivation-in-north-east/articleshow/86819579.cms||---

Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari recently announced a 5.9-km-long multi-layer transport project at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore that will take shape within two years. Nashik NHAI project director B S Salunke told TOI both the agencies will join hands to prepare a common DPR. “While the upper deck will be used for plying of metro neo trains, the lower one would be for vehicles. The other nitty gritty of the project like construction, cost sharing, among other things will be worked out between NHAI and Maha Metro later,” added Salunke. Both NHAI and Maha Metro had earlier prepared their own DPRs for a flyover and metro corridor separately on Nashik Road. The Nashik Road stretch is a part of the Nashik Road-Gangapur corridor of the metro project. Similarly, the NHAI had also prepared a DPR to connect Dwarka with Datta Mandir on Nashik Road to ease traffic congestion. “But the problem is that both these projects would not come up separately due to lack of space. Both the agencies would require huge space for the flyover and the metro corridor to run parallel,” Salunke said. Gadkari had chaired a meeting with the NHAI officials during his Nashik visit recently about the NHAI’s flyover project and ordered that a double-decker flyover must be constructed that can be used for both metro trains and vehicles. Senior Maha Metro officials said they are aware of the decision that was taken by the Union minister to have a double decker flyover at Nashik Road. “It’s a welcome decision and we will collaborate with the NHAI to have a common DPR,” a Maha Metro official said. NHAI officials said that this project would be on the similar lines with the one that has come up in Nagpur. “The deck for vehicles would be joined with the railway overbridge at Nashik Road for unhindered movement of vehicles entering/exiting the city to and from Pune, Shirdi and Ahmednagar. It will likely be a 4-lane flyover,” added NHAI officials. Nashik city MP Hemant Godse said the double-decker flyover would be a boon for Nashik city in improving movement of vehicles and easing traffic snarls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/two-agencies-to-team-up-for-nashik-double-decker-flyover/articleshow/86816838.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||Rs 7,638 crore diverted by Unitech promoters, Rs 1,820 crore property attached: ED to SC||NEW DELHI: Revealing findings of its probe on siphoning of funds by the erstwhile promoters of Unitech group, Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the Chandra family had diverted Rs 7,638 crore for purposes other than construction of housing society in which around Rs 14,000 crore was invested by homebuyers. Appearing before a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, additional solicitor general Madhavi Divan said ED had attached properties worth Rs 1,820 crore and the agency has so far detected diversion of Rs 7,638 crore. Immediately after this statement, the bench restrained the ASG from disclosing any other information and asked her to file a status report in a sealed envelope on the next date of hearing. ED’s probe seems to confirm the findings of a forensic audit report of the company, which was done on the direction of the apex court. Around Rs 14,270 crore was deposited by 29,800 home-buyers and Unitech took a loan of Rs 1,805.86 crore from six financial institutions for construction of 74 housing projects. After examining the account books of Unitech Group and its subsidiaries, the auditor, in its interim report, said Rs 5,063 crore or 40% of the collections from homebuyers were not used for the housing projects while outflows of Rs 2,389 crore were still to be ascertained. The report said nearly 40% of the money raised from financial institutions amounting to Rs 763 crore had not been utilised for construction. The court proceedings witnessed heated exchange of words between Chandra family counsel Vikas Singh and the bench after the former alleged that the court had been passing a series of ex-parte orders against them without giving them an opportunity to prove that there was no diversion of funds. The senior advocate said Unitech promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, in jail for the past four years, had built the second largest real estate company of the country and handed over more than one lakh units to homebuyers, but the court was not providing them forensic audit report to rebut allegations. “Lordships are presuming that there is diversion of funds... The forensic report was prepared without talking to us and now ED had arrested my 81-year old father and wife and it had not questioned him,” he contended. Singh raised questions on what will happen if the court comes to the conclusion that there was no money laundering and if the management of the company will be restored. He said in that scenario, the court may lament in future for not hearing them. At this stage, Justice Chandrachud got furious and asked him not to use such language. “Is this the language used in court? Is there no sense of responsibility?” he said. Justice Shah also said it was not expected from Singh. The court said there were “reasons and reasons” for arresting them, but it could not be revealed as the probe was on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ed-to-sc-rs-7638cr-diverted-by-unitech-promoters-rs-1820cr-property-attached/articleshow/86821109.cms||---

Though the Telangana Rashtra Samithi has managed to get prominent and middle-level leaders from Congress and BJP it is in no mood to leave anything to chance. “Rajender contested on Telangana Rashtra Samithi tickets and won six times. The party is not leaving any stone unturned as it is a prestigious election for us,” a senior TRS leader said. Sources said that of the five mandals in the 2018 election, Rajender secured majority in Kamalapur, Jammikunta and Ellanthakunta, while opponent Padi Kaushik Reddy got more votes in Huzurabad and Veenavanka mandals. Kaushik Reddy joined TRS a couple of months ago and party is hopeful of getting votes with his support, including from his native Veenavanka with many Reddy votes. At village and booth level, to ensure that the pink party gets better of its friend-turned foe, the TRS has roped in 50 middle-level and local leaders in each booth. In the last election, at booth level Kaushik got more or equal votes in villages Indiranagar, Pothireddypet, Chelpur, Rajapalle, Ippala Narsingapur, Gudur and Damakkapet.

As part of his preparation for Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) exams, the deceased — Kishor Jadhav, hailing from Sinkheda of Dhule district — had been living in the city for the past five years. The youth took the extreme step by hanging himself sometime in the wee hours of September 30, following which a case of accidental death was registered at Kranti Chowk police station. As per the complaint lodged by Kishor’s elder brother Vikas, the former had got acquainted with a woman who was also preparing for the MPSC. This woman, on the pretext of her mother’s treatment, asked for a loan of Rs 7 lakh from Kishor. His suicide note stated as he had no money to give to the girl, he took a handloan from his girlfriend who works in Mumbai. After Kishor started demanding the money from the suspect woman, the latter along with her boyfriend and five others, includin a police constable, started bothering him. Perturbed by the harassment, Kishor decided to end his life. Kranti Chowk police inspector Ganpat Darade said though the contents of the call recording as well as the suicide note are the same, they are yet to be authenticated by the forensic team and handwriting experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cop-among-6-booked-for-suicide-abetment/articleshow/86816881.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: After delimitation, KMC poll to have 27 wards and 81 corporators||KOLHAPUR: The total number of wards in Kolhapur city will come down to 27 while the number of corporators will remain at 81 in the upcoming municipal corporation election. As per the state government’s decision, the elections for the urban civic bodies have to be held as per the “three member per ward” system. The state election commission has released detailed guidelines for the civic bodies for delimitation of the wards. The civic bodies have to submit the draft delimitation of wards to the poll panel. It was anticipated earlier that with increased population, the number of wards — and thus the number of corporators — will increase. However, the poll panel has asked civic bodies to consider the 2011 Census figures to delimit the wards. In the 2015 civic body election too, the 2011 Census figures were considered, and 81 wards were formed. A senior KMC election official, requesting anonymity as the poll panel has asked that the task be carried out in secrecy, said: “The size of a ward depends on the population and not the number of voters. Voter-strength may vary from ward to ward, but the population size remains more or less the same. Therefore, on applying the 2011 Census, the city will have 27 wards . Since three candidates will win from each ward, the total number of corporators will be 81.” As per 2011 Census, the city has a population of 5,49,236. To calculate the population size forward, the poll panel has provided a formula. The population is divided by the number of corporators and then multiplied by the number of candidates to be elected from each ward (3 in case of KMC). In the case of Kolhapur, each ward will, therefore, have a population of 20,342. The commission has set a flexible limit of ±10% meaning. The poll panel has asked civic bodies to complete the exercise of draft delimitation as soon as possible and has not set a specific deadline. The panel has asked authorities to ensure the process is kept confidential to avoid misreporting and legal disputes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/after-delimitation-kmc-poll-to-have-27-wards-81-corporators/articleshow/86816945.cms||Abhijeet Patil

According to the officials, the severity of Covid has declined, following which the city is registering fewer daily cases. However, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials have cautioned people to maintain the Covid appropriate behaviour as there is a prediction of another Covid wave. The city reported the first Covid patient on April 6 last year and the cases started increasing from next month. By May 30 last year, the city had 143 active cases and it increased to 1,143 by June 30 last year. During the peak period of Covid in September 2020, the city had 6,200 active cases. Then the cases started to drop. The second wave of Covid began from the second half of February this year. By April 23, the city reported 28,000 active cases.

It was on October 20, 2019, that Bhartendu Singh lodged a complaint on the portal of the department of administrative reforms and public grievances, on finding three villages, including his own, missing from the revenue records. The villages, with a population of over 3,200 people, have not seen development in years, he alleged. To save his skin, district panchayati raj officer Vachaspati Jha disposed of the complaint in a fraudulent manner and also submitted a fake consent letter with fake signatures of the complainant on CM’s grievance redressal portal. When Singh learnt about the fraud, he moved court, which ordered a probe into the matter, along with an FIR against the DPRO under sections 167 and 471 of IPC. Divulging details, Singh said, "Village panchayat Papali Kala comprises three villages -- Samandpur, Mausampur and Madipura. But all three do not exist on paper.” Samandpur village has a population of 1,000 people, Mausampur 800 and Madipura 1,400. Expressing resentment over the apathetic attitude of authorities, he said, “These villages are in bad shape. Their link roads need immediate repairs. As they are not in revenue records, development never took place here.” "My complaint was disposed of without informing me. A fake consent letter was uploaded on the portal. When I learnt about it, I met DPRO. Instead of hearing me out, he started misbehaving with me,” Singh said. Police said a case had been registered against DPRO, who trashed the allegation, saying the complaint filed by Singh was disposed of as per rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/district-panchayati-raj-officer-booked-for-fraud/articleshow/86815120.cms||Harveer Dabas

Officials claim that the initiative is aimed at improving the understanding and performance of students at 354 primary schools in its jurisdiction. The east corporation has started inviting proposals from organisations having long experience in this field and is planning to launch the programme by November. A senior official explained that the organisation finalised by them would be given one and a half months to evaluate the teachers on the basis of various factors, including teaching ability, communication skills, lesson plan ability and attitude, and divide them into groups for improvement in the areas they are lagging behind through proper trainings or workshops. “A majority of permanent teachers have been working with us for decades and there have been major reforms brought into the education system in all these years through new education policies. They include restructuring of the pedagogical structure, digitalisation and new teaching techniques. We want our teachers to understand as well as adopt these methods in daily teaching,” said the official. The sessions will be organised for the teachers as well as head of schools. EDMC officials said that they would conduct random inspections and check all activities being undertaken by the organisation. After six months, the civic body will again conduct a drive to analyse the effect of the training programme on the performance of teachers in classes as well as the results of students. “Children need to have a good understanding of their subjects and that can be possible only when the teachers use best ability, tactics to explain topics diligently. In fact, they need to adopt ways to get students’ full-fledged attention, such as using simpler or day-to-day examples and arranging more group discussions or activities to help children, especially the ones who are below average. We expect full cooperation from teachers in making this project a success as it will automatically help them to improve,” said the official. A similar attempt was made in 2019 by New Delhi Municipal Council that engaged the Quality Council of India for the assessment of teachers and students in its primary schools to improve the overall educational standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-project-to-evaluate-teaching-skills-of-its-staff/articleshow/86793744.cms||Vibha Sharma

Many of them have not even received the first shot, Gadve said. Gadve, who recently held a meeting with labour contractors at Chakan, said, “We told them we could not vaccinate workers due to shortage of doses in July and August. We now advised them to get their workers vaccinated as doses were available.” The workers are mainly engaged in temporary jobs . “Many companies in Chakan conducted vaccination drives for their permanent employees. As per our estimate, over 1.5 lakh employees were fully vaccinated, while over 50,000 were due for the second dose,” Gadve added. Dilip Batwal, secretary of the Federation of Chakan Industry, claimed they too had urged the contractors to vaccinate their employees. A contractor Sharad Mohite said, “It was tough as the centres didn’t have doses.” Another contractor Sanjay Kute, said the companies could have accommodated the workers. Dr Nanda Dhawale, in-charge of Rural Hospital Chakan, said, “In July-August, we administered 100 doses per day. We are giving over 500 doses daily for the last few weeks.”  “We cannot afford to stand in a queue for long as we have to report to work. If we do not go to work, we will not get the day’s salary,” said a worker Bapu Mormare. “Most of us have been working with the companies for years.

The healthcare workers alleged that the PCMC had promised permanent jobs to most of them, but after the Covid cases started declining, they were removed from their positions. With outsourcing of medical staff facilities via private agencies, they have lost out on their only hope of getting employment, they said. Sagar Yellale, who was a ward boy at the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital before his contract was terminated on October 2, said, “Earlier, our contract was terminated in January. That time, too, we had staged protests. When the second wave arrived, we were told to join and now again our contracts have been terminated. With private firms in the picture, there are apprehensions about job security and payment issues.” “We want the PCMC to renew our contract. We also want Covid compensation along with the provident fund. We want our contract to be at least for three years,” said Yellale, who is also a member of the Corona Yoddha Bachao Kruti Samiti’. PCMC chief Rajesh Patil said, “Outsourcing of medical manpower via private agencies will streamline the services of workers on contract. PCMC cannot offer them a contract of over six months to 11 months. The apprehension they have about untimely payment will be looked into, and action will be taken if the private agency fails to pay them on time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/healthcare-staffers-on-contract-stage-protest/articleshow/86819652.cms||---

The woman’s 13-year-old daughter sustained 30% burns, but is stable. Police said the fire broke out due to a leakage in the LPG cylinder pipe. The victims have been identified as Sushila, her daughter Mansi and twin brother Mohan. The daughter who has been injured is Mehak. Police received a call around 9am reporting a major fire in a house in Anand Parbat. A police team reached the spot and found four people had sustained burn injuries and were taken to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Initial investigation revealed that the house caught fire from a leakage in the pipeline of the cooking gas cylinder. “Mehak was cooking for her mother and twin siblings who were sleeping. Due to the leakage, the LPG cylinder caught fire that spread to the rest of the house. As locals spotted the fire, they rushed to the house to rescue the family,” said a senior police officer. The director of Delhi Fire Service, Atul Garg, said at least two fire tenders were sent to the site. “All four were moved to RML Hospital where one was declared dead while another was referred to Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel Hospital and then to Safdarjung Hospital,” Garg said. Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said the hopsital informed late on Tuesday night that the twins had succumbed to the burn injuries. The 13-year-old daughter is under treatment and stable, she said. The DCP said initial probe had revealed that the fire broke out due to the leakage in the rubber pipe connecting the LPG cylinder to the burner. The fire spread rapidly, giving the family no time to escape, she added. “At the time of the incident, Sushila and her children were alone at home while her husband, Rajesh, who works at a flour mill, was away in the factory,” Chauhan said. The bodies have been sent for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mother-twin-kids-die-in-fire-13-yr-old-daughter-also-hurt/articleshow/86821169.cms||---

The elderly man’s son, a Wakad resident, recently lodged a complaint with the Pimpri Chinchwad police. An officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police said that the caller asked the complainant’s father to download a remote access application and used the same to siphoning off the funds. The complainant told TOI, “My father is an ex-banker. All his four accounts are with the public sector bank where he worked. After the two fraudulent transactions, I tried to contact the customer care number, which was mentioned in the SMS sent by the bank. Surprisingly, the number was not reachable. While, we were trying to contact that number, few more transactions occurred and my father lost Rs7.5 lakh to the fraudsters.” He said that all this happened within 40 minutes. “My father received a message on his cellphone regarding updating his SIM card. When my father contacted the cellphone number that was mentioned in the message, the person on the other end of the call requested him to download an app, which was a remote access app,” he said. He said that with that app, the fraudster got access to his father’s four bank accounts. “He siphoned Rs7.5 lakh from these accounts,” he said. The complaint’s said that after the two transactions occurred, his father informed him. “We tried to contact the bank’s customer care number.

---||Ahmedabad||Petrol price breaches Rs 100 in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: On the back of high crude prices, the petrol price in Ahmedabad breached the Rs 100 mark on Thursday, settling at Rs 100.04 per litre. The price of diesel hit Rs 98.90 per litre. For petrol, the price climbed by 29 paise in a single day, while diesel rose by 37 paise, according to prices shared by petroleum dealers. The higher prices have not just upset the monthly budgets of commuters, but also have left industry concerned. Experts say high fuel prices will cause a further increase in the cost of essential commodities such as milk, vegetables, FMCG goods and others. “The high price will marginally affect demand, as people rarely refuel cars by the litre but instead buy fuel worth a certain amount. Of course the same people will get their vehicles refuelled more frequently, but it will not translate into a direct increase in sales for dealers,” said Dhimant Ghelani, secretary, Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA). The massive increase in fuel prices this year has affected consumers’ budgets as their spending on fuel has increased, especially while more and more people are returning to working from offices. “Essential commodities will get costlier and higher prices are ultimately passed on to consumers. Prices are increased when fuel prices rise but are not rolled back when fuel costs get reduced,” said Ankit Patel, an IT professional. The increased fuel price also comes as a blow to trade and industry players, who are already battling cost pressures with rising raw material prices and freight charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/the-rs-100-pinch-of-petrol/articleshow/86819665.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Man tagged Covid-19 positive without test||AURANGABAD: Parbhani district health authorities have ordered an inquiry after a paramedic from the Manwat taluka claimed he had been declared Covid positive though he had not undergone any test to check for the viral infection. Shubham Kumawat, who works with a private health setup in Parbhani district, located around 190 km from here, said he had gone for Covid vaccination to the Manwat Rural Hospital on October 4. There, local health workers requested him to undergo RT-PCR testing after he took the jab. “I simply refused to undergo the test as I was not having any symptom. They requested me to get the test, saying that they have to achieve the daily target of Covid tests. As I was reluctant, the staff simply asked for my name and mobile number to fill the records and allowed me to go home without taking a swab,” Kumawat said. The 22-year old, however, was shocked when he got a call from the health department on the evening of October 5 — saying that he had tested positive. “The health authorities asked me to visit the hospital for Covid treatment. When I asked them how could i have tested positive without giving a sample, the authorities asked me to visit the hospital first. I took up the matter with higher authorities, who told me that they will hush up the matter provided I give a swab sample,” he alleged. The Covid testing sample of Kumawat was reportedly sent to the government-run lab at Parbhani and also carries the ICMR identification number. When contacted, medical superintendent at Manwat Rural Hospital Dr Naren Varma said an inquiry had been ordered into the whole incident. “Parbhani district civil surgeon will monitor the inquiry, which will be completed as early as possible,” he said. Notably, Manwat taluka in om Parbhani district has been witnessing more fresh cases of Covid-19 as compared to other talukas. The district administration on Wednesday held a special Covid review meeting at Manwat, during which scaled-up Covid testing and other measures have been ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-tagged-covid-positive-without-test/articleshow/86817021.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Jaipur||HC ban order may hit plan to regularise land in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The state government's ambitious six-month special campaign, ‘Shahar-2021’, may face a setback after the Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday banned the regularisation of illegal colonies in cities without implementing zonal and sectoral plans. The order was given on a petition filed by Roshan Vyas. As per rules, regularisation can only be done in cities with a population of over 1 lakh after implementing the zonal development plan. Out of 29 big cities, the zonal plans have only been put in place in some cities, including Jaipur and Jodhpur. “After the high court order, the urban development and housing (UDH) department will expedite the process of implementing zonal plans in bigger cities,” a senior UDH official said. “It will not affect the regularisation process as camps will be held for long to complete the process,”the official added. Similarly, a ban has also been imposed on smaller cities which do not have layout plans. “There are 184 small cities and none of them have layout plans. However, plans have been prepared for most of the cities. A legal advice will be sought and the process of regularisation will begin soon,” a source said. The state government is aiming to issue 10 lakh lease deeds during the campaign. The major attraction of the campaign was regularisation of colonies on agricultural land. It is estimated that about 7-8 lakh houses, partially or fully constructed on agricultural land, need title deeds. The court has also banned the regularisation of plots developed on areas earmarked for utilities. Following this, the UDH department on Wednesday also issued directions to withdraw the previous order to regularise plots on such areas. “As per norms, colonies can be regularised if they are developed as per 60:40 ratio. While 60% can be used to develop land plots, the remaining 40% land is to develop facilities, including roads, water tanks and parks. There are developers who have made plots on land meant for parks and roads. The court has banned regularisation of such plots,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-ban-order-may-hit-planto-regularise-land-in-state/articleshow/86821150.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: 3,000 shut hostels in state keep tribal pupils at home||PUNE: Over 3,000 hostels run by the tribal development department and social welfare department in the state have still not reopened for students forcing them to continue study online despite reopening of physical classes. Parents in rural places and extreme interior parts of the state have been demanding to reopen hostels so that their children could also be part of the regular classes. The school education department officials stated that the hostels are to be cleaned and arrangements with respect to medical help should be arranged before restarting. A fresh set of SOPs for hostels would be announced by the government soon after which it would reopen for students. Subhalakshmi, a volunteer who works with the tribal children in Ahmednagar, said, “Schools have reopened for higher classes and in rural areas for Std V onwards, but the students who have registered in the hostel cannot take the benefit of this relaxation. They are eager to go back to school. Many students do not have the necessary digital devices for online education and hence they should be the priority to send to schools with proper precautions.” The students are facing network issues and unable to connect to the online classes as a result of the same.  In Maharashtra, there are 491 hostels run by the tribal development department and 2,761 social welfare departments. The parents of the students studying in these schools said that the schools in rural parts of the state are buzzing with activity since Monday. “We enrolled our students in hostels because we are either migrating or the schools are far from our villages. The hostel facilities should be revived and with appropriate care and precaution the students can be prioritised,” Kamal Sihore, a parent of a tribal student, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3000-shut-hostels-in-state-keep-tribal-pupils-at-home/articleshow/86819703.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar tweeted that AMC teams were checking vaccination status at food courts, restaurants, and hotels across the city. “We are asking people to go to the nearest universal vaccination centre and get the jab,” the AMC official said. Since mid-September the civic body had begun blocking access to its facilities to unvaccinated citizens. The AMC had cited 20 government orders and notifications of various Indian states to defend its ‘no-vaccine, no access to public facility’ stand. “Places such as Puducherry, Guwahati, Shimla, Bhubaneswar, and several areas of West Bengal deny access to public facilities if citizens are not vaccinated,” the AMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/from-today-vax-status-checks-at-your-office/articleshow/86819727.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Covid cases up, but jabs weaken severity in Vadodara||VADODARA: Strange as it might sound, but this has been witnessed in Vadodara city, as a majority of new Covid-19 cases reported since September 20 are people who have received both doses of vaccine. But there have been no deaths and none of the patients needed intensive care. Despite vaccination, several experts and public health authorities have repeatedly warned that Covid-19 appropriate behaviour will have to be followed. And data available from the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is a clear indication of that. Over 66% of the 33 cases recorded in the city from September 20 to October 5 were of persons who were completely vaccinated. On the other end, only 18% of these positive patients needed hospitalisation and none of them had a serious condition needing intensive treatment. Infectious disease expert Dr Hiten Kareliya said that this was expected and it proved that vaccinated people did not have a severe infection and there was no requirement of ventilators or BIPAP machine support. “I will take this as positive news,” he said. “The data reveals that there is no reason to let our guards down and Covid appropriate behaviour will have to be followed. Social distancing may be becoming difficult due to need to travel and work, but we can always wear masks and follow hand hygiene,” said Kareliya. He said that if Covid appropriate behaviour was followed strictly for a couple of weeks by all, the pandemic would spare us. VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that it was expected that some people will get infected as the efficacy of the vaccine is around 70%. At the same time, he added the sample was too small and there was no controlled group to compare the data. Patel added that the data was also an indication that people still need to follow Covid-19 guidelines. “People should understand that while there may be hardly any serious coronavirus case, but they might just be the unfortunate one to be such a patient,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccine-makes-symptoms-mild/articleshow/86818683.cms||Sachin Sharma

For this purpose, the ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism, culture and religious affairs Dr. Neelkanth Tiwari while addressing a conclave on ‘Making Uttar Pradesh Water Positive’, organised by The Times of India in association with the UP Government on Wednesday. Addressing the inaugural function, Tiwari said, “The ambitious Namami Gange programme has been undertaken for the conservation of rivers and water resources. Besides, a number of projects have been initiated for water conservation through revitalization of ponds and waterbodies. The work of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has also been linked with water conservation.” “Before 2014, the increasing pollution in the river Ganga in Varanasi, Prayagraj and Kanpur had been a serious issue of concern. But, after the Namami Gange initiative, the situation has improved significantly and Ganga has become clean at these places,” said Tiwari. The matter of sustainable development has been discussed at different forums, but for the first time it was debated in the legislative assembly, he said, adding that today work is on for sustainable development. Tiwari said that in Kashi only, about 20 drains were falling into the Ganga and the sewage treatment plants (STPs) were not functioning properly before 2014. “Today, the three new STPs are fully functional in Varanasi,” he said and added that similar initiatives have been undertaken in Kanpur for the treatment of wastewater. “Furthermore, the ministry of tourism is working on ecological balance through initiatives like the Ganga tourism circuit,” he said and added that wastage of water should be prevented. Speaking on the occasion, minister of state for Jal Shakti and flood control Dinesh Khatik said that water is essential for life on Earth. Highlighting the importance of water conservation approach, he said that only 15-20% water is sufficient for irrigation of cane crop through drip irrigation. “There is a need for sincere efforts to end water scarcity in future,” he added. Earlier, Dr. Venkatesh Dutta from the School of Earth Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University gave an insight of the conclave through a powerpoint presentation. Under Make India Water Positive initiative, a number of activities have been launched to create awareness about water conservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/water-is-shakti-its-conservation-is-important/articleshow/86819706.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Low-pressure system may bring rain from Ashtami||KOLKATA: The city is set to have a wet Durga Puja under the impact of a low-pressure area, which is likely to form over north Andaman Sea on October 10 and may develop into a cyclonic storm and hit south Odisha and north Andhra coast on October 14. Consistent rain with the chances of a heavy downpour has been predicted in Kolkata and its adjoining south Bengal districts on October 14 and 15 (Nabami and Dashami) while light to moderate showers are expected on October 13 (Ashtami). In the run-up to the festival, the weather of the city will be dry with “low” chances of rain or thundershower between October 9 and 12, said the officials of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) on Wednesday. “The low-pressure system will form around 1,000 km away from the coast and will gain strength as it approaches the coast over the next four to five days. While it is expected to have a landfall between north Andhra and south Odisha — much like last week’s cyclonic storm that had hit the same region — this system is likely to be a stronger one. Since it is forming in October, the chances of its turning into a cyclonic storm are very high,” said RMC director GK Das. Kolkata and south Bengal may fall within the outer band of the system and receive moderate to heavy rain. “There will be a strong south-easterly wind during the period that will help to bring in the clouds and lead to rain. We expect rain to begin late on October 13 (Ashtami) and remain light to moderate the next day. It could turn heavier on Dashami (October 15), with the possibility of Kolkata receiving a heavy spell on one of these two days,” added Das. Along with Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly are likely to receive light to moderate rain during the festival. Meanwhile, southwest monsoon has started receding from north Bengal, which is likely to remain dry during the festival. Kolkata has received almost double the normal volume of rain — 96% above the normal mark — in September even as Gangetic Bengal has recorded 31% excess rain so far in this monsoon (June 1 to September 30). While Kolkata’s overall rain count in this monsoon is 31% above normal, Bengal has received 15% excess rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/low-pressure-system-may-bring-rain-from-ashtami/articleshow/86819696.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||India||Denied raise, junior engineers take out ‘supari’ on their boss; held||MUMBAI: Two Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC) junior engineers were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the firing on their colleague, executive engineer Deepak Khambit. Police said the duo had given a contract on Khambit’s life as they were miffed with him for denying them promotions and plum postings. The alleged shooter was arrested from Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. The total arrests in the case have gone up to six. Shrikrishna Mohite (46) and Yeshwantrao Deshmukh (49) have been attached to MBMC since early 2000. They told police that Khambit was part of a committee that looked into promotions. He allegedly gave them adverse remarks which stalled their rise in the organisation. Khambit did not respond to TOI phone calls. Mohite and Deshmukh offered a contract of Rs 20 lakh to an ‘activist’ Raju Vishwakarma, who often made the rounds of MBMC. Vishwakarma runs the organisation Fight for Rights, and had spent time behind bars. During his prison stint, Vishwakarma got acquainted with Amit Sinha, an ex-Chhota Rajan henchman. “The conspiracy was hatched over six months. The group had meetings to plan the hit. Sinha and Singh carried out a recce,” said a senior officer, while Pradeep Pathak, a manager with Vishwakarma’s organisation, was involved in the conspiracy. A month-and-a-half ago, Mohite handed over Rs 10 lakh to Vishwakarma for the job. Vishwakarma hired Sinha and the shooter, Ajay Singh. On September 29, Khambit was returning to his Borivli residence. He was in the back seat of his official car when two bike-borne men came up to his vehicle. One of them fired two rounds from close range. The bullet missed Khambit but shattered the window pane. The glass struck his face and neck. In 2013, Sinha was involved in a conspiracy for attempting to murder bookie-turned-builder Ajay Gosalia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/denied-raise-junior-engineers-take-out-supari-on-their-boss-held/articleshow/86825635.cms||---

However, a major chunk of the work would be completed by the end of this year, he added. Singh was addressing Times Water Conclave 2021, organised by The Times of India along with knowledge partner WaterAid India on Wednesday. He said that the state government is working on an accelerated pace for the implementation of schemes meant for irrigation, water supply, rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharging and strengthening of ponds, rivers and other water bodies. He said, “Making a significant move, the government recorded irrigation of 11 lakh hectares of land in 4.5 years of the Yogi Adityanath government. It has been targeted to enhance the figure to 25 lakh hectares by the end of five years, which would be a record in itself.” “For water recharging, the government has implemented Atal Bhujal Yojana,” he said, adding that the government has also enacted a law for the groundwater management under which the provision of rooftop rainwater harvesting is essential for the buildings. He further said that 20,000 ponds were recharged in the first year, while 15,000 ponds were strengthened in the second year. “Besides, five big rivers were also undertaken for strengthening in the state. Now, work has started in 15 rivers,” he said. The minister also made an appeal to the people to create ponds in their villages in the names of their ancestors to show respect to them and contribute to environment conservation as well. Speaking about water scarcity and contaminated ground water in different regions of the state, he said that the government is working on piped water to address the problem. Highlighting the Namami Gange programme, Singh said that it is the impact of Namagi Gange that dolphins are now visible in Ganga. “The level of dissolved oxygen has increased significantly, improving the river’s health that was also evident during the Kumbh mela,” he said, adding, “Real- time monitoring of every ghat through CCTV cameras has been started.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/every-household-to-get-tap-water-supply-by-2023-singh/articleshow/86819741.cms||---

The education department said that the process will be finalised by October 25 and the admission for students in waiting list was underway. The RTE admissions started four months later and the process has not been completed. According to the RTE admissions portal, 35,000 seats across schools in Maharashtra have still not been filled up. The process is being conducted in 9,432 schools in Maharashtra for 96,684 seats. The education department received 2.22 lakh applications for which a lottery was drawn and seats were allotted to the eligible students. After the second wave, the lockdown was announced so the admission process was hampered, Dinkar Temkar, joint director of state directorate of primary education, said. “After restrictions were relaxed, the admission process resumed and students were given time from June 11 to 30 to confirm their admissions. This date was further extended for those who had been allotted the seats,” he added. After the regular round, there were still some vacant seats which were opened for students in the waiting list. About 70,000 students had received admissions as per the latest RTE admissions data and several seats still remained vacant. Temkar added, “The main stage of the admissions process is over. The second round for admissions to students in the waiting list is underway. After this round, another round will be conducted and finally the admission for this year will be closed by October 25.” MESTA protestThe Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA) announced on Wednesday that if the fee against RTE admissions is not reimbursed to the institutions in one month, the school representatives would launch a major protest rally at the state assembly. President of MESTA, Sanjay Tayde Patil, said, “The issue has been pending since the last four years. The reimbursement is shared in a 60:40 ratio by the Union and state government. The state government has not reimbursed its share to the schools, nor has it completely paid the amount received from the Union government. We have requested the government on many occasions in the past and now we cannot wait any further. It will be our last one month’s notice to the government or else we shall stage a major protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lengthy-rte-admission-but-35k-seats-still-vacant/articleshow/86819743.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The sonography machine was recently inaugurated by president of the cantonment board B Ragesh, though the unit will be put to use from next week. Senior medical officials of the Cantonment hospital said that the service of the ultrasound machine would be available on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Dr Manisha Honrao of the cantonment hospital said that the hospital had an ultrasound machine earlier and it was operational before the Covid-19 pandemic last year. However, after the outbreak of Covid -19, the hospital was converted into a Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) and the machine also developed a technical snag. A good Samaritan of Deolali Camp recently donated the ultrasound machine and dialysis unit, which would be helpful to not only the residents of Deolali Camp but also Bhagur and 28 villages around it. Before the Covid pandemic, around 30 to 40 patients used to come for ultrasound checking. Rahul Gajbhiye, chief executive officer of Deolali Cantonment Board, said, “We are looking for some organization or institute to run the dialysis unit and offer the service at an affordable rate to the patients. The dialysis unit too would be of immense benefit to the residents of Deolali Camp. Patients with non-Covid ailments have started coming the hospital from last month. After increase in number of Covid-19 patients in the second wave in March this year, the hospital was converted into a DCHC. Patients with non-Covid ailments had to go to other private hospitals or come all the way to Nashik Road at the Bytco hospital or Nashik civil hospital in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-cantt-hospital-gets-ultrasound-dialysis-machines/articleshow/86817107.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Citizens’ group distributes festive gifts to 250 families in New Town||KOLKATA: A group of citizens in New Town has spent a part of their Durga Puja budget to bring cheer to 250 Muslim families in a nearby village, by gifting food and saris to women and clothes to children for the festive days ahead. Members of New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity on Wednesday drove to Panapur, around 15km from New Town, and handed out the clothes and food, worth Rs 3 lakh, to the families, most of them belonging to the financially weaker sections. The fraternity collaborated with Ammucare charitable trust for the programme on Wednesday afternoon but the preparations had begun much in advance. The money for donation was carved out of the Durga Puja funds by the members of the fraternity. “Durga Puja is not exclusive to any particular community. People from other faiths are connected with various aspects of this festival, which transcends religious boundaries and embraces multiple faiths,” said Samir Gupta, secretary of the welfare organization. Members of the group had also been instrumental in helping those in distress during the second wave of the pandemic in April-May this year. “Our families buy new clothes as well as other things during Durga Puja for the people of the economically disadvantaged sections. The idea behind helping these people is to connect them with the festival and convey to them the message that the festival is as much theirs as ours,” said Gupta. The donation was made in a small ceremony arranged by the villagers on Wednesday afternoon. Several families had gathered before the members of the organization arrived. “We noticed how their faces lit up when they saw us. The children and women were happy to receive new clothes from us,” said Gupta. Many puja organizers have scaled down celebrations owing to the pandemic. They are utilising some part of their budget to reach out to those, who are under financial distress. “Every year, we try to do something that can bring a smile on the faces of others. So, this programme was a part of our plan,” said another member of the forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-group-distributes-festive-gifts-to-250-families/articleshow/86819751.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Surat||44 students lose track in forest, rescued||SURAT: A group of around 44 students and faculty members of S D Jain College who were out tracking in the forest near Devghat of Surat district on October 1 lost their way for a while when they went off track. However, as they kept in constant touch with their families over phone, forest department team traced the group and brought them back safely to the eco-tourism point in Devghat. College officials claimed that the students were constantly in touch with their teachers, even as forest officials stated that misadventure by the students led them astray from the forest track. “If our team would not have reached on time, the students would have had to stay longer in the forest making it extremely dangerous for their lives. Around 35 watchmen, beat guards and foresters swung into action and traced the group immediately,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat. A group of nearly 430 students and 22 teachers had gone to Devghat eco-tourism point in buses on October 1. Majority of the students were spending time at the eco-tourism point, while one group ventured into the forest in the evening for tracking along with a few faculty members. “Within 15 minutes the exact location of the lost students could be traced and brought back safely by government officials,” said a college official. One of the students alerted his parents over phone and they, in turn, informed a senior BJP leader, who sought help from the forest department. After being brought to safety, the students were provided food and sent back only after all of them were fit enough. “On being informed our teams contacted the students and found their location through mobile phone GPS. They were around four kilometres away from the eco-tourism point when our teams reached there,” Nayyar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/44-students-lose-track-in-forest-rescued/articleshow/86818635.cms||---

According to police, three youths were sleeping inside the shanty in Rewari Line on September 28 after cooking food on a gas stove. “We suspect that they forgot to turn off the cylinder knob, which led to the incident,” an officer said. The deceased have been identified as Ram Chhala, Vimal Yadav and Pintu, and Shrawan and Lali, the couple lived near the shanty. Shrawan and his wife detected a strong smell of gas emanating from the shanty and knocked on its door. As soon as one of the youths switched on the light, the fire broke out and all five people got injured, the officer said. “The leaked gas had spread across the room. All of them were immediately taken to a hospital, but they died within a week during the treatment,” he added. Shrawan was first to die, followed by Chhala, Pintu, Vimal and Lali. “The woman died on October 5,” the officer said. “Vimal, Pintu and Ram were friends and doing petty jobs. The husband and wife were working as labourers,” an officer said. Investigators are surprised how the youths who were sleeping inside didn’t smell the gas. “A strong smell was coming from the shanty, but they remained unaware,” the officer said. According to the fire department, it has no record of the incident. The local police were informed by the hospital. Investigators found the shanty had completely burnt, with a damaged cooler lying on the floor. “We found that the gas cylinder and the stove were kept at a corner,” a cop said. A case has been registered under IPC sections 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) at the Mayapuri police station. “But the suspects are already dead,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gas-leak-all-5-injured-in-fire-in-mayapuri-shanty-on-september-28-dead/articleshow/86821219.cms||---

The state government recently decided to restructure the previous one-member ward to three-member ward system. In the 2017 civic election, there was four-member ward system. The term of that house ends in February this year. Accordingly, the number of wards will increase from existing 31 to 41. NMC officials said they have received a letter in this connection from the state election department and they would start restructuring the existing wards as per the new order in a day or two. “We will submit the draft plan of the wards as per three-member ward system to the state election department once it is prepared,” said NMC officials. In the last civic polls held in February 2017, one voter from all the 31 wards had to select one candidate contesting from each of the four prabhag under the ward. “But as per SEC’s instruction, a voter will need to vote for three candidates,” said a civic official. At present, BJP has the sole majority with 66 elected members in the 122-member house. Sena is the main opposition with 35 seats, Congress and NCP have six seats each and MNS five. The remaining seats are held by smaller parties and independents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/3-member-ward-voting-for-civic-polls-in-nashik/articleshow/86817121.cms||Tushar Pawar

As per Unesco’s ‘State of the education report for India 2021’, Goa has 239 single-teacher schools. The number of such schools in the state are up from 230 last year, which was pointed out by data of the Union education ministry. To blame for this scenario in Goa is an age-old norm followed by the state directorate of education (DoE), which makes primary schools eligible for a second teacher only if they have an enrolment of 24 or more students. This has taken a toll on government primary schools in the state, which are grappling with low student numbers. Government primary schools are pushed into a vicious cycle as having a single teacher means fewer children are motivated to join the school, and fewer children means not being eligible for a second teacher, as per state norms. Of the 1,486 schools in Goa, 239 are single-teacher schools, states the Unesco report. At one point, the number of such schools in Goa stood at nearly 350. However, assistance under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has helped allotment of a second teacher in many of the government primary schools, pulling them out of the difficult situation. “States with a high percentage of single-teacher schools include Arunachal Pradesh (18.2%), Goa (16%), Telangana (15.7%), Andhra Pradesh (14.4%), Jharkhand (13.8%), Uttarakhand (13.6%), Madhya Pradesh (13%), Rajasthan (10%),” the Unesco report reads. As per DoE officials, para teachers also assist single teacher schools on a rotation basis. But being a single-teacher school means the teacher not only teaches alone from Class I to IV, it also means that the school is not eligible for a head teacher or clerical staff to carry out the administrative duties due to the low enrolment. This means that a single teacher is burdened with these duties as well on a daily basis. The Unesco report, however, also points out an encouraging sign, where Goa has the second-highest percentage of female teachers in the country. Having more female teachers is seen as a good sign, due to the more nurturing qualities attributed to women educators. “States and Union territories (UTs) where over 70% teachers are women include several that are ranked high in the performance grading index(PGI). These include Chandigarh (82%), Delhi (74%), Kerala (78%), Punjab (75%), Tamil Nadu (75%), Puducherry (78%) and Goa (80%),” the Unesco report reads. Goa is also listed among states where between 97 and 100% of schools are accessible by road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goa-1-in-6-primary-schools-has-just-one-teacher-unesco/articleshow/86821241.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Whatever reforms are required for the building sector will be undertaken in consultation with the industry,” Patel said addressing a bevy of real estate developers at the launch of CREDAI Foundation, a permanent corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative of CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED. “With your support, the government will make all efforts to minimize administrative confusions as much as possible. We want to put an end to the practice where files (projects) are held up due to two or more interpretations of a single provision. Once a provision is made, it should carry only one meaning (interpretation) at a time,” added Patel, who himself is a builder. He, however, quickly made it clear that his government has never done anything wrong and will never indulge in any wrongdoings. “Get one thing clear, any stain on me is a stain on you,” the CM told the developers. Talking about the delays faced by realtors in project execution, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI)’s national vice-president Shekhar Patel stated that around 12 months are consumed from the time the non-agriculture permission for a land is sought till the realty project receives registration from the state Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). “The government should take steps to reduce this period to 3 months to expedite project execution. The construction sector provides highest employment, pays maximum taxes to the state and Centre as well as it is the biggest wealth creator,” the CREDAI national vice-president said. CREDAI-Ahmedabad has created a permanent foundation for its CSR activities. “The foundation aims to take up CSR activities, which include skill development of labourers, providing nutritious food and education to the children of construction workers. It will also develop a public garden on Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation land near CREDAI-Ahmedabad house in the city,” said Tejas Joshi, president, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, which an Ahmedabad city chapter of CREDAI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cm-promises-administrative-reforms-for-real-estate-sector/articleshow/86819772.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||14% schools in Andhra Pradesh function with just 1 teacher: UNESCO||VISAKHAPATNAM: The ground reality of school education in Andhra Pradesh seems to be grim. As per the UNESCO’s latest report- ‘State of the Education Report for India 2021’, nearly 9,100 schools or 14% of the total schools in Andhra Pradesh are being run with just a single teacher. The report was developed based on analysis of two secondary data sets – Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+) 2018/19 round and the Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018/19. Low learning outcomes are correlated with lack of sufficient faculty. As per the Right to Education Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school having up to 60 students, while there shall be at least one teacher per class from sixth to eighth class. As per the report, nearly 49% of the total teachers working in Andhra Pradesh are women. The majority of teachers in urban areas are women, in contrast with rural areas. The early childhood education, special education and private unaided schools sectors are also highly feminised. Operation Blackboard, the first centrally sponsored pan-India scheme to improve infrastructure in primary schools, recommended that all schools should have a minimum of two teachers, at least one of whom must be a woman. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the National Policy on Education 1986 recommended increasing the percentage of women teachers to 50 per cent as a strategy to improve girls’ participation in schools. About 10 per cent of upper primary and 8 per cent of secondary level teachers are underqualified in Andhra Pradesh. On an average, 86 per cent of schools across the country, including 89 per cent of urban schools and 85 per cent of rural schools, are accessible by road. But it is 100% in Andhra Pradesh. Only Delhi, Chandigarh and Goa have achieved the same feat. The government schools in Andhra Pradesh are found to be outperforming private schools in providing lessons through social media, radio and television, print materials access, recorded lectures and/or engaging students in online lectures. Narava Prakasa Rao, convenor of Andhra Pradesh Right to Education Forum, said that the state government should also focus on filling the vacant teacher positions in the schools. “The schools are getting a facelift under the Nadu-Nedu scheme on the infrastructural front. But teachers play a key role in moulding the students and in the overall performance and academic outputs of the students,” said Prakasa Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/unesco-14-schools-in-ap-function-with-just-1-teacher/articleshow/86818634.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

He said that allotment of tickets will be based on the MLAs’ performance, indicating that some non-performers may face the axe. “Every party always does this,” he said. “No party is able to give tickets to everyone. It all depends on how one has performed, how good one’s connect is with the people. I will not say that all (MLAs) will get a ticket. It is not possible at all. Everyone knows it. Every time, every state practices this. The same will be done in Goa.” He said that the job of allotting tickets is done by the party centrally, but recommendations for tickets will go from from the state BJP. “Surveys are carried out by the state team and central team, but the ticket is allotted at the Centre. BJP is a national party with a parliamentary board, which allots the ticket. When the time comes, the parliamentary board will allot the tickets,” the CM said. Sawant said that the recommendations for tickets will be made from Goa based on an internal survey being conducted by the party in the state. “We are carrying out a survey and obviously we want the party to form the government again. So definitely, based on the survey, the recommendations will be made as per our survey, not any other survey,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-not-all-sitting-bjp-mlas-will-get-ticket/articleshow/86821265.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Nashik||Average wholesale onion price rises at Lasalgaon||Nashik: The average wholesale onion price at the country’s largest wholesale onion market at the Lasalgaon APMC has increased by 20% in the past six days due to a drop in supply. In the retail markets, onion prices have increased to Rs 40-45 per kg, against Rs 30 a kg around a week ago. The average wholesale price has increased from Rs 2,400 per quintal on October 1, to Rs 2,950 per quintal on Wednesday. If a fortnight is to be considered, the wholesale price has almost doubled — on September 22, the wholesale price was Rs 1,450 per quintal. According to the APMC officials, the supply of onions has reduced due to the recent heavy rainfall. The drop in supply, when compared to the demand, led to a rise in the average wholesale prices. The arrival of onions have reduced from 15,000 quintal a day around a fortnight back, to around 7,000-9,000 quintal following the recent showers. The supply had dropped to around 5,000 quintals immediately after the rainfall, but it has slightly improved over the past two days. Around 9,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Thursday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 1,100 and Rs 3,353 per quintal, respectively. At present, the onions arriving at the wholesale markets are the summer crop harvested in March and April. Summer onions have a shelf life of over six months and farmers prefer to store summer onions with the hope of getting better prices. They sell their stored onions as and when needed. There is no fresh crop till mid-October and the summer onions stored by the farmers cater to the markets between April and September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/average-wholesale-onion-price-rises-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/86817177.cms||Tushar Pawar

Two of the women are from Thailand and all the accused women were present at the spot for prostitution, police suspect. Of the accused, 20 men are from different areas of the city and district. They gathered at bungalow number 47 to celebrate the birthday of one of the accused Kaushik Mayani. Police seized 142 bottles of liquor worth Rs 30,550, mobile phones worth Rs 1.69 lakh and vehicles worth Rs 25 lakh. Police received specific information about the party being organized with women and liquor after which a team of Palsana police station raided the bungalow. Mayani’s birthday was a few days ago but he was not present in the city then, so he organized the party on Wednesday night. Mayani is a businessman and he sent invites through WhatsApp. The Thai women are staying in the Magdalla area of the city. They told police that they are on business visa and claimed that they are eligible to consume liquor. However, police arrested them since they were present at the spot of crime. The Thai women are not cooperating with police claiming language limitations, sources said. Police raided the bungalow at around 12.30 am and the raid continued till early morning. “All the men arrested are part of a group and friends of Mayani.

---||Goa||Goa: Despite govt relaxation, not many premises rented out to tourists register with dept||PANAJI: The state has not seen a noticeable increase in the registration of ‘D’ class units — flats, houses and bungalows rented to tourists — even after such properties were offered relaxation under the new rules. Of the 559 units under this category, only 41 were found to have been newly registered. Last October, the tourism department had declared that a registration certificate would be issued to an applicant unit pending inspection so that administrative hassles did not discourage owners from registering their properties. “There have been fresh registrations, but not on our expected lines. Probably, some are still facing problems in getting NOCs from panchayats,” a senior tourism official said. The Goa Registration of Tourist Trade Act was amended last year making it mandatory for all tourism trades to register with the department. For some years the trade body, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) has been demanding a crackdown on unregistered properties. In fact, after the hospitality industry opened last year as the first wave of the pandemic subsided, and work from home became the new normal, a huge demand was seen for independent units and flats. Domestic tourists who drove to Goa choose to stay in rented flats and houses rather than booking into a hotel. Hotelier Ralph De Souza said that whether it is a long or brief stay, travellers find it economical to stay in rented bungalows or row houses rather than in starred hotels. “There has been more demand for houses and flats. Such tourists either drive down to Goa or they rent a car here during their stay,” De Souza said. Another trader who has put his boutique property on rent for tourists said that the demand has grown over the years and mostly all do well. “My property is registered with the tourism department plus I have all the permission, but there are many who don’t and that’s not fair,” he said. The tourism official said that they have a squad in place to check on properties that are advertised online and notices are issued to unregistered properties. Every day, one or two properties are inspected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-govt-relaxation-not-many-premises-rented-out-to-tourists-register-with-dept/articleshow/86821277.cms||---
---||Goa||After 8-year wait, Goa gets cyber forensics lab||PANAJI: The state’s first cyber forensics laboratory was finally made operational on Wednesday at the Goa police’s cyber crime cell at Ribandar, reports Gauree Malkarnekar. The lab is expected to help improve detection of cyber crimes in the state. Until now, over 50% of cyber crime cases reported in the state had to be closed due to lack of evidence. The Goa government first gave its nod to set up the cyber crime cell in the state in December 2013, along with permission to recruit technical persons for the same. But establishment of the lab did not materialise. Now that it is functional, the laboratory is expected to help investigations using technology and tools to detect cybercrime and forensic investigations of such crimes. The lab is a well-equipped, dedicated facility, where trained police personnel will make use of digital and forensics analysis for detection, extraction and analysis of data to help bring cyber criminals to book, said crime branch SP Shobit Saxena. So far, not a single person has been convicted in the state for a cyber crime. Since 2014, 118 cases have been registered at the cyber crime cell at Ribandar, and closure reports have been filed in 61 cases. Police, however, said that the two fake call centres that were recently busted in the state were detected through investigations at the new lab. Last year, the Union government approved Rs 1.4 crore for Goa police to set up the cyber lab. So far, the cyber crimes reported in Goa include financial crimes involving cheating, credit card frauds, money laundering, cyber photography involving production and distribution of pornographic material, sale of illegal articles such as narcotics, weapons and wildlife, intellectual property crimes such as theft of computer source code, software piracy, copyright infringement, trademark violation, deployment of virus, cyber-attack, cyber terrorism, etc. Investigating these requires computer skills, mainly for on-site imaging of disks and on-site analysis and tracking of leads. The digital forensic lab (DFL), besides cyber crime detection, is also equipped to carry out all types of training across a wide range of digital forensic capabilities. The lab also provides the facilities to undertake forensic investigations and data recovery functions. Fully equipped with licensed digital forensics software, DFL can assist in providing forensic expertise to any mobile, computer, hard disk incidents, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-8-yr-wait-goa-gets-cyber-forensics-lab/articleshow/86821295.cms||---

Akinwole Kolawole, a resident of Bengaluru, has been charged under Section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66 c (fraudulent use of digital passwords to carry out theft) of the Information Technology Act. In the last week of September, the suspect visited Kolhapur city and withdrew cash worth Rs 25,000 approximately from various ATMs. A complaint was registered at Shahupuri police station on September 30. Based on CCTV footage from ATMs, the police traced the accused. The police had laid a trap and arrested him red-handed. Kolawole has been granted police custody till October 7. Inspector Rajesh Gawali of the Shahupuri police station said, “We have also traced another person, who was working with the accused. We expect a well-developed network of Nigerians to be involved in the crime. We have sent a team to Bengaluru for further investigation. We have recovered ATM cards of several banks from the Nigerian national.” Gawali said that getting information from the accused was difficult as he didn’t speak much to the law enforcement authorities. The officer added that the accused will be tried on the basis of available evidence. “We appeal to citizens to change the password of their ATM cards regularly and ensure there is no cloning machine at the ATM centres before withdrawing cash,” said Gawali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/man-uses-cloned-card-to-withdraw-cash-held/articleshow/86817173.cms||---
---||Mumbai||100 structures built on garden plot in Bandra demolished||MUMBAI: About 100 houses built illegally on a plot reserved for a garden at Bandra Bandstand were demolished in a major drive launched by the BMC earlier this week. Assistant municipal commissioner of H West ward Vinayak Vispute said that the demolition drive was initiated on Monday, and 95 huts had been removed. TimesViewWith the city already starved of accessible public open spaces, any reserved space should be developed as priority. The BMC must ensure that encroachments which have been cleared do not re-enter the space and that the open space is protected and under the regular, watchful eye of the civic body and local residents.“In 2019, we had undertaken an inventory of encroachments and found that of the 170-plus structures, only around 30 are eligible structures. However, people living in 65 structures went to court so, we were unable to act against them. In the current demolition, drive we have taken action against the remaining illegal structures,” said Vispute. As the plot is strategically located, on the sea front with the Bandra Worli Sea link in the backdrop, local residents have demanded that the open space be converted into a tourist attraction on priority. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said that while the demolition drive is a good move, a major challenge will be to keep the encroachers away permanently. “The BMC carried out a survey of the plot in 2019 but even after that hundreds of new houses were built. While the plot is reserved for a garden, currently it has no boundary wall, leaving it unprotected and open to further encroachments,” Zakaria said. Local residents also echoed Zakaria’s concern. They said that whenever demolitions were carried out in the past, it was observed that the encroachers were back in no time. So, they said, the anti-encroachment campaigns were nothing but a wastage of manpower and machinery. Benedict Soares, trustee of Bandra Bandstand Residents Trust, said that a lasting solution is needed to tackle such encroachments, which keep returning. Vispute said that plans are already afoot to display boards restricting any encroachments. “BMC will also stay vigilant so that no new structure comes up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-100-structures-built-on-garden-plot-in-bandra-demolished/articleshow/86822836.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Varanasi||TWC is not only an event, it’s a life-saving campaign, says Yogi||Cleared By RE Varanasi: “The Times Water Conclave (TWC) is not only an event but a life-saving campaign,” said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath here on Wednesday. Addressing the conclave under The Times of India’s ‘Make UP a water positive state’ initiative at hotel Taj Ganges here on Wednesday, the CM said, “Water is a must for healthy nature and also human beings. Availability of clean drinking water cuts half of the expenditure on treatment of ailments. Through TWC, TOI is imparting the art of living to the masses by forwarding this initiative in a mission mode.” Further talking about the importance of clean water, the CM recalled, “After entering 38 districts of east UP in 1977, Japanese encephalitis had been claiming around 1,500 lives, mainly of children, per year. Since 1998, I have been raising the issue in and outside Parliament. However, no one paid attention to it despite the fact that the children becoming victims of JE belonged to the same castes and communities that were being exploited as vote banks by the opposition parties for decades.” “In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Clean India mission and construction of toilets in each household started,” he said adding, “After assuming the CM’s office in 2017, I ensured construction of 2.50 crore clean toilets in one and a half year,” the CM said. “I also formed an inter-departmental coordination committee to combat JE by making the health department as the nodal agency. Apart from ensuring construction of toilets, this committee initiated many other measures, including ensuring clean drinking water in these 38 districts. Now, the mortality rate due to JE has come down to 98%,” said the CM. Stating how the Namami Gange programme launched by the PM has changed the quality of water of the river Ganga, the CM said: “The world had realized how the Ganga started becoming free from pollution during the 2019 Kumbh of Prayagraj. Guests from NRI meet at Varanasi, including Mauritius premier and a 400-member delegation had visited Prayagraj on my request. While performing Ganga Aarti, they noticed the clean water and later they all decided to bathe in the Ganga.” “I had also taken feedback from NDRF personnel about the quality of the water in the Ganga during my recent visit to take stock of the flood scene in Varanasi. The NDRF personnel said that in the past three years, the quality of water has improved as now they do not suffer skin allergies as in the past on staying in the river water for long during rescue operations,” said Yogi. He also mentioned that the “return of the Ganges dolphins in the river is also proving how the river water quality is improving”. “After the Ganga, its tributaries are also being covered under this programme,” said Yogi, adding, “Dredging of rivers like the Saryu to improve their water channel has not only minimized the threat of floods in the state, but income through auctioning of sand has also been started.” He said that over 60 rivers have been revived by linking with public and MNREGA. “Despite the fact that massive work has been done for the rivers, there are more critical issues,” said Yogi. “In 2017, I found that of 824 development blocks in the state about 50% had become dark zones, including 300 in critical category. However, no attention was paid towards it despite the fact it was hazardous for the earth as well as water consumers,” he said while mentioning how initiatives of his government like Kashi and Chitrakoot models of ground water recharging, ban on plastic, allowing potters’ fraternity to collect clay from ponds and others helped in positively changing the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/twc-is-not-only-an-event-its-a-life-saving-campaign-says-yogi/articleshow/86819775.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The home launches in Ahmedabad market jumped by 193% to 4,257 in the third quarter of the current calendar year. The launches had stood at 1,176 in the corresponding quarter last year, states a report by Knight Frank India. In fact, Ahmedabad recorded the second highest growth in new launches among the top eight cities in India. Hyderabad topped the list with a growth 650% during the quarter, the real estate consultant’s report further shows. Similarly, housing unit sales in the quarter under review rose 37% to 1,607 units from1,176 units in the same period in 2020. Ahmedabad was among the bottom two cities in terms of sales growth. The enhanced need of Amdavadis to own a home, move to a bigger house, lowered sale prices, and record low interest rates were primary drivers for increased demand in the residential real estate market, said real estate developers. “While, on one hand, there has been a strong demand for residential units across categories, on the other, unsold inventory fast depleted to its lowest levels. In order to cater to the resurgent demand amid lowest inventory, more and more developers have come up with new projects,” said Tejas Joshi, president, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, a city chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI). “Real estate market is currently very positive with the threat of the third wave fading and vaccination drive going very strong. This has further helped in improving the market sentiment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-home-launches-in-ahmedabad-jump-193/articleshow/86819795.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Goa||Goa: Four held for assaulting club guard at Calangute||CALANGUTE/PANAJI: The security guard of a nightclub in Calangute suffered grievous injuries after he was allegedly assaulted near the Calangute market junction by four “gangsters” late on Tuesday night. The four have been arrested. North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena denied reports terming the incident as a gang war. According to Calangute police, the victim, Swapnil Redkar, 30, lodged a complaint that the accused accosted him at the nightclub and after spraying pepper into his eyes, allegedly assaulted him with a sword, chopper and iron rod on his right leg, due to which he suffered bleeding injuries. “Last (Tuesday) night, it came to the notice of police that some criminal elements had come to a Calangute club and there was some disturbance. Calangute police, led by PI Nolasco Raposo, immediately rushed to the spot and apprehended one criminal named Tarzan Parsekar, who is from Nagoa. Later on, it was learnt that there were three other criminals who had come here for creating this disturbance,” said Saxena. He said a team led by Raposo was dispatched to Pernem police station, based on the reported location of the criminals. “By late night, our staff apprehended all three criminals who were involved and wanted in the case, and an offense has been registered under Section 326 of the IPC and the Arms Act. Further investigation and recovery of weapons is ongoing. We will take strict action. There is zero tolerance to these kind of criminals who are disturbing peace,” said Saxena. Saxena said that action would be taken to ensure that such incidents are not repeated. “They are found to be repeat offenders, and we have consulted the public prosecutor and we will take action so such things are not repeated again. It is not correct to call it a gang war. These are criminal elements who came here and got into some kind of fight. We are investigating very objectively,” Saxena said. On Tuesday, as soon as police received news of the assault around 8pm, a patrolling police vehicle rushed to the spot and prevented the situation from getting worse. In the melee, three of the four accused managed to escape from the spot, while police nabbed one of the assailants, Tarzan Parsekar, who has a number of criminal cases registered against him at the Anjuna police station. The three absconding accused were also subsequently nabbed in the early hours from Pernem as they were trying to flee to Maharashtra, police said. The three have been identified as Imran Bepari, a history sheeter from Santa Cruz who is out on bail in another case, Surya Kambli, a resident of Taleigao, and Suraj Shetye, a resident of Merces, both of whom also have cases registered against them. The victim, Swapnil Redkar, is a resident of Torda, Porvorim. According to police, the incident is a fallout of previous enmity and the accused had come to take revenge. Meanwhile, Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martin has urged police to invoke the strongest possible sections of the law against the accused to prevent such incidents from being repeated in Calangute. “We’ve been told there were some issues between the victim and the accused because of which there was a fight,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-held-for-assaulting-club-guard-at-calangute/articleshow/86821307.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: 90% measures in place, ready for 3rd wave, says GMC dean||PANAJI: GMC dean and chairperson of the Covid-19 expert committee Dr S M Bandekar on Wednesday said that 90% of preparations for the possible third wave have been completed. “The paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) is ready,” Bandekar said replying to reporters. The situation was “static” with regards to new infections, while the preparations have been almost done. The seropositivity among children was found to be almost 70%, and though the sample size was not big enough, it indicated that if the third wave at all happens, it won’t be as massive as was the second wave, Bandekar said. He said people must comply with the SOPs when pointed out that since the rush of tourists has increased, hardly anybody displays Covid appropriate behaviour. The crowding at tourist spots as well as outside casinos in Panaji, has been a common scene since their reopening last month. “Public must understand its responsibility,” Bandekar said, evading a question if the SOPs are being really implemented. It was told to Bandekar that crowding in the capital, whether at the Church Square or outside casinos, it was by the domestic tourists. “After all they are also human. But they should comply with the SOPs for their own good as well as for the society,” he said. Asked, if crowding is allowed, will it not cause cases to rise, he said, they are watching case positivity rate, and if it rises, they will ask the government to stop all activities. “It must be taken into account that many Goans have become jobless in the pandemic. A balance needs to be found,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/90-measures-in-place-ready-for-3rd-wave-gmc-dean/articleshow/86821297.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||TN: Strategies change; tiger still in hiding in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The search for the elusive tiger, which is identified as Mudumalai Division Tiger-23 (MDT-23) continued for the 12th day in the Masinagudi and Singara forest ranges in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR)-buffer zone here on Wednesday by setting up four treehouses (machans) and reducing the total number of forest special task force (STF) and rapid response team (RRT) personnel in the combing teams to 50. This time, the teams mainly combed the outer circles of the location in the desperate effort to trace the big cat. However, the teams could not spot the tiger as the heavy rain in the evening disrupted the operation. A forest officer said the number of people in the combing teams was reduced to ensure that the tiger and other animals were not disturbed during the operation. In the past 11 days, at least 120 to 150 forest, STF and RRT personnel were involved in the combing operation. The treehouses, the officer said, were set up to monitor the tiger’s movement and tranquilize the animal. It was also the day when Shekar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, joined the ground search teams to check the potential habitats of the tiger - riverine and valleys edged by bamboo thickets. “We used high resolution and fast-moving drones to scan the areas that we had zeroed in on based on the recorded evidences and data. Those were the areas that had high chances of the presence of the MDT-23. We, however, didn’t succeed on the day. We have intensified surveillance around the human habitats for the night,” he told TOI. According to him, the operation to capture MDT-23 would be resumed at 6am on Thursday. “The plan is to increase the camera trap density in the identified areas and engage grazers in the search operation.” Earlier in the day, Niraj had told the media that they were adopting different scientific strategies in the operation to capture the tiger. “The scientific methods are very complex and we have to be very careful, as we need to ensure the safety of the teams as well as the animals. High quality drones that are used in car racing are used for the operation to obtain high clarity visuals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/strategies-change-tiger-still-in-hiding/articleshow/86821308.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Floating manja hurts throat, finger of biker||PUNE: A stray manja used to fly kites caused injury to the throat and left-hand index finger of a two-wheeler rider in front of the College of Military Engineer campus gate in Dapodi on Monday. The victim, Ashish Pawar, (32), a private bank employee residing at Bopodi, on Tuesday evening lodged a complaint with the Bhosari police against unknown persons. “I was returning home after office work, on my motorcycle around 5.45pm when I felt a sharp pain in my throat. I was at a spot in front of the CME campus gate. When I checked, I found that it was a kite string. I also realised that there was a cut on my left hand’s index finger too,” Pawar told TOI. Pawar said he sustained injuries because of the manja, the abrasive string used in kite-flying. “I also noticed a few boys running after the kite,” he added. He said he was at a slow speed or could have fallen off. “Moreover, I was wearing the helmet, due to which the injuries on my throat were not deep, but, I have sustained a deep cut on my finger,” Pawar said. After the incident, Pawar went home and got himself treated in a hospital. “I approached the police on Tuesday and filed a complaint,” he said. An officer from the Bhosari police said that a case under section 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against unknown persons. “We have launched a drive against the shops, who are selling the manja illegally,” the officer said. Death by kite string A 26-year-old woman ayurvedic doctor was killed after her throat was slit by kite string on the flyover at Kasarwadi in October 2018. The doctor, Krupali Nikam, a resident of Pimple Saudagar, was riding her scooter from Pune to Bhosari. On February 7, 2018, Suvarna Mujumdar (42), who worked with the marketing department of a media house, was killed after her throat was slit by manja while she was on her scooter on Shivaji Bridge near the PMC building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/floating-manja-hurts-throat-finger-of-biker/articleshow/86819799.cms||---

The state cabinet approved the amendments to protect rights and the livelihood of traditional fisherfolk. A government press release said technological advances ensured fishing can be carried out on a massive scale with little human effort. The use of purse seine nets, trawlers and LED lights must be regulated, and hence the amendment. The Act, it said, has not been amended in 40 years despite advancement in technology in the fishing industry. The amendments will allow appointment of an officer from fisheries department in place of tehsildar to hold hearings and expedite decision-making. It will introduce more stringent punishment for illegal fishing, which include an increase in penalty and confiscation of boats used for illegal fishing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-govt-to-amend-law-for-fisherfolk/articleshow/86822853.cms||---

The corporator, Ambarnath Kamble, filed an FIR with the police on September 23. A Sangvi police team led by assistant inspector Satish Kamble arrested the suspect, Suraj Wagh of Dwarka in Nashik, following technical investigation. “Wagh was produced before the court on Wednesday and has been remanded into police custody till October 8,” Kamble told TOI. On September 19, Wagh had contacted corporator Kamble on his cellphone and told him that his eight-year-old daughter had been run over by a truck and she was in the YCM hospital for treatment. Wagh then requested Kamble to transfer Rs6,500 for her medical tests. Believing him, Kamble transferred the amount through his wife’s e-payment app. When the suspect again called for Rs 10,000, Kamble visited the hospital with the cash and found that nobody by that name was being treated there. Assistant inspector Satish Kamble said during probe, it was revealed that the caller was from Nashik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nashik-resident-held-for-duping-corporator/articleshow/86819826.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Spot-billed pelican is Kolleru Lake mascot||Amaravati: The forest department has selected spot-billed pelican as brand ambassador for Kolleru Lake. Prateep Kumar, principal chief conservator of forests, said the decision to have a brand ambassador was taken to protect Kolleru wetland site. Speaking to the media here on Wednesday, Prateep Kumar said Kolleru Lake was declared as wildlife sanctuary in 1999 and it is the responsibility of every citizen to protect such a rare herniate site. He said that the Centre has declared Kolleru as designated wetland of international importance under Ramsar Convention in 2002. “We will organize a awareness programme in Kolleru Lake as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav shortly,” said Prateep Kumar. He said they would appoint Wetland Mitras to take up awareness activities in the region. Since about 40% of the pelicans across the globe were residing in Kolleru, they thought that it was apt to select the bird as brand ambassador to create awareness about Kolleru wetland, said Prateep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/spot-billed-pelican-is-kolleru-lake-mascot/articleshow/86818689.cms||Samdani MN
---||Nashik||Karad blames state govt for delay in central teams’ visit||Aurangabad: Union Minister of State for finance Bhagwat Karad on Wednesday blamed the state government for the alleged delay in the visits of the central teams to the rain-ravaged areas in Marathwada. “The Maharashtra government has not yet submitted the official report on rain-related damage incurred by Marathwada to the Centre. The central teams can visit the affected areas only after the state government submits its report to the Centre,” he said. This information has evoked sharp reactions from farmers’ groups that have criticised the state government for the alleged delay in taking official cognisance of the large-scale rain-related damage in Marathwada. Farmers’ leader Jayaji Suryawanshi said it was unfortunate that the state government could not submit the official report almost a month after the natural disaster. “Marathwada was battered by the rain early in September and even in the second half of the month. The necessary report has not been prepared so far because the process of panchanamas is yet to cover scores of affected villages. The state government needs to set its priority right,” he said. Farmers groups also said that effective help to farmers cannot be offered unless the Centre is involved in the relief measures. Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve said some rain-hit agriculture areas in Marathwada are still submerged, posing problems in carrying out panchanamas. “The state government is ensuring that not a single farmer is left out during the official process of offering relief. Once all the panchanamas are done, the necessary report will be submitted to the Centre,” he said. Karad also demanded a special relief package from the state government for Marathwada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/karad-blames-state-govt-for-delay-in-central-teams-visit/articleshow/86817252.cms||Prasad Joshi

Thakor Patel, 58, a resident of Saraspur, in his FIR with Cybercrime police said that his son Bhargav Patel googled for IOC petrol pump dealerships and found a website, which they later found was spurious. Unaware that the website was fake, Bhargav filled in his details to apply for an IOC dealership on January 4. On January 18, he got a call from a person who promised massive returns if he invested Rs 15 lakh in the business. On the same day, the man sought Rs 10,000 as ‘registration fees’ for the dealership. As Bhargav paid the money, the man through calls and emails kept asking for various different amounts of money as different charges. Between January 27 and February 3, 2021, Thakor used to give money to his son to pay the man and they ended up paying him Rs 39.60 lakh. The man told Bhargav he would come to inspect the proposed site of the Patels’ petrol pump in Vansda on February 12, but no one turned up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/petrol-pump-dream-costs-man-rs-40l/articleshow/86819809.cms||---

---||Meerut||Punjab CM’s motorcade stopped from entering UP, Pilot turned back||MEERUT: The motorcade of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was stopped from entering Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday by several contingents of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and police personnel deployed at the Gauripur checkpost on the UP-Haryana border on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. A senior police officer on condition of anonymity told TOI that the convoy was “requested” not to enter UP. “The fleet of cars with the Punjab CM likely wanted to use the expressway to reach Delhi Airport, but we asked them to turn back,” he said. The convoy had to use another route to reach Delhi airport where several senior Congress leaders along with Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM and Rahul Gandhi boarded a flight to Lucknow. UP police remained on high alert on Wednesday and every vehicle entering the state underwent checking. Congress leader Sachin Pilot from Rajasthan was also stopped in Pilakhwa (Hapur), according to IG Meerut range Praveen Tripathi. Pilot later arrived in Delhi and took the road to reach Sitapur where Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was under detention at the PAC compound. “We are being stopped repeatedly on the highway. This is not the democratic way. Even detention of Priyanka ji for three days in Sitapur was unconstitutional. We are going to Sitapur and then to Lakhimpur Kheri to wipe off the tears of the bereaved families and doing so in a peaceful manner. What is so wrong about it? The government will have to pay for this kind of attitude,” said Pilot. At a massive gathering in Muzaffarnagar, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary, echoed Pilot's sentiments. “Leaders of the opposition are being detained and stopped from seeing the families of the deceased farmers. If opposition will not remain, then democracy will also not remain," Chaudhary said. Chaudhary, who had met one of the bereaved families in Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday, said he felt he was in Kashmir during his visit. “During the visit to Lakhimpur Kheri, I felt I’m in Kashmir or in a Naxal area, because internet services had been snapped, even phones were not working in the region,” he said at an event in Muzaffarnagar’s Sisauli organised by the leaders of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) on the birth anniversary of BKU founder Mahendra Singh Tikait. Farmer leaders gathered in large numbers said the protest against the farm laws would continue “till their last breath”. BKU chief Naresh Tikait said the way the farmers were being treated now — as evident by what happened in Lakhimpur Kheri — was worse than the atrocities that were committed in the colonial-era. “Farmers are being called Khalistani and Pakistani. They have been on dharna for 10 months and many have lost their lives." he said. Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Karan Chautala, son of Indian National Lok Dal senior leader Abhay Singh Chautala, also attended the event. Heavy police force was deployed even as additional district magistrate Amit Kumar and several officials stayed in the village during the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/punjab-cms-motorcade-stopped-from-entering-up-pilot-turned-back-from-hapur/articleshow/86817261.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Goa||Goa: Acute space crunch hits Hospicio as patients surge||PANAJI: Hundreds of patients and citizens visiting various OPDs and casualty at Hospicio Hospital, Margao are struggling to access treatment and maintain social distancing due to the acute space crunch at the premises. Overcrowding is witnessed in several wards and OPDs, including surgery, medicine, gynecology and paediatric as well as wards, with patients in South Goa left with no other option but to suffer silently. Some patients have raised their voice and complained to hospital authorities that they were discharged early although they were not fit, and were subsequenlty transferred to periphery hospitals to free up beds for other patients in need of urgent treatment. Staff too have been finding it tough to manage the crowds of regular patients that have begun pouring in post the second wave of the pandemic. With things opening up, the hospital expects the number of regular patients to increase significantly. As the number of regular patients visiting the old hospital rise, the new South Goa district hospital in Margao with a capacity of 560 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, is lying almost vacant with only one ward on one floor currently being occupied by around 15-odd patients. The district hospital has had less than 30 of its beds occupied since July. “Regular patients need care too, but they are suffering. There are accident, deliveries, etc, and it’s difficult to manage the patients. There’s not enough space for everyone. We have to keep adjusting and making space, but there’s no more space and patients get angry,” a nurse at Hospicio told TOI. The medicine OPD at the old Hospicio hospital itself sees around 200 patients each day and footfalls in the casualty have also soared. Other OPDs like surgery witness over 100 people every day. The old building is also not disabled-friendly and doesn’t have a covered waiting area for patients who are forced to stand outside. The space constraints at Hospicio had forced authorities to shift to the spacious new district hospital last year before the monsoon. But then as Covid cases began to rise, authorities shifted back to Hospicio when the district hospital was required for treating Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acute-space-crunch-hits-hospicio-as-patients-surge/articleshow/86821342.cms||Lisa Monteiro

In the absence of a standard operating procedure (SOPs) from the state, both Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) have not been issuing any season or daily tickets to students. The state government has opened schools for classes 8 and 12. A majority of these students are under 18 years of age. In a letter to the state government’s disaster management authority undersecretary, CR’s senior divisional commercial manager Gaurav Jha wrote: “Students are approaching unreserved ticketing system (UTS) counters over Mumbai division requesting for journey/season tickets. At present there are no guidelines for issuing of journey/season tickets to students for travelling by trains in local train over MMR region.” The October 4 letter further stated: “It is requested to kindly issue guidelines for issuing of tickets for students willing to travel by local trains.” A booking clerk said, “Students plead and sometimes get into arguments when tickets are denied. It is a waste of time and stressful for both railway staff and the students, as sometimes the exchange can get heated. It is better that the state government allows them permission to travel.” A teacher from a junior college in an eastern suburb said, “Only students from Class 8 to junior college are allowed to attend. They are usually below 18 years of age and hence not eligible to get vaccination. The state government cannot expect students to spend money on private vehicles to commute.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-seeks-sops-for-train-commute-by-under-18-students/articleshow/86822907.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Nashik||MNS tells officials to fix VIP Road within a week||Aurangabad: The stretch of road from the Cidco bus stand to the Harsul t-point, commonly known as the VIP Road, has developed potholes at many places severely inconveniencing the motorists. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Wednesday gave a week’s time to the authorities concerned to carry out the necessary repair works. MNS district president Suhas Dashrathe pointed out that the nearly 5km road was made ready by the public works department (PWD) in May this year at a cost of Rs 60 lakh. The monsoon rain has exposed the sub-standard quality of works as the road is riddled with potholes again. “The VIP Road has around 2,000 potholes, making commuting along this stretch a nightmare for four-wheeler drivers and two-wheeler riders. Large-scale corruption is responsible for the road developing so many potholes within a few weeks,” he said. On Wednesday, the local unit of the MNS also held a symbolic protest during which pooja of the potholes was carried out. Another MNS functionary, Ashok Pawar, said it was outrageous that the VIP Road, which is on the route to the World Heritage Site of the Ajanta Caves, is in such a bad condition. “While on one hand Aurangabad is said to be a part of the Smart City Mission, on the other hand, an important road is pothole-ridden beyond imagination. Such shoddy work is definitely projecting the city in a bad light in front of foreign tourists besides giving troubled rides to local citizens,” he said. Earlier, Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan, during his official visit to Aurangabad on September 26, had said that entirely new construction of the VIP Road was on cards, instead spending money on repairs. Local Congress and Shiv Sena leaders from Aurangabad had raised the demand for repairs before Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mns-tells-officials-to-fix-vip-road-within-a-week/articleshow/86817273.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Fogging on at Ponda after ‘dengue’ death||PONDA: Two days after a suspected dengue death in Ponda, health officials on Wednesday have found some spots susceptible to mosquito breeding near the house of the deceased teenager. Health officials have also claimed to have undertaken fogging and taking other measures to prevent further breeding of mosquitoes in the area. Sejal P Naik, 17, who was a First Year BCom from Nagzar-Curti, died on Tuesday, and her family had claimed that the reason was due to dengue. Dr Kalpana Mahatme, nodal officer of vector borne diseases at the Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Panaji has said that the teenager had fever and cough at the time of admission to the Ponda sub district hospital, and since her blood pressure was dropping, she was referred to Goa Medical College, Bambolim for further treatment, but she could not survive. “We do not know the exact cause of her death.

Residents of the area recorded the incident on a mobile phone to prove the allegations. Police arrested Vasram Padmani, who was earlier in the finance business, for allegedly sodomizing the boy. Police suspect that the accused sodomized the child in the past as well but he was never caught red-handed.

In the incident, the boy’s father, a diamond artisan, returned from work on Tuesday night when people from the society came to meet him and showed him the video. The locals had recorded the crime on their mobile phone. Later, the father lodged a complaint with the police.

Earlier, a local farmer had claimed that an object had fallen in his farm on September 24, following which GSDA had visited the spot to conduct a detailed study. Senior geologist from GSDA Brijpalsingh Thakur said the reddish stone, which is said to have dropped from the sky, does not belong in space. “The spot inspection did not reveal impact on the ground due to the alleged fall of the object from space. Ideally, a deep depression or crater is expected to be formed on the ground due to the fall of the meteorite, which was absent. In fact, grass was growing at the alleged point of impact,” he said. Thakur said the object also does not have any burn marks on its periphery on its entry into the earth’s atmosphere. Large meteoroid spotted A relatively larger meteoroid was spotted over Aurangabad on October 3. Astronomer Amit Raka, who spotted the ‘fireball’, said it was the most spectacular meteoroid fall he had observed over the city sky so far. It was observed in the north direction, between Perseus and Auriga constellations while moving from the east to west. “Meteor showers are a phenomenon, where space rock enters earth’s atmosphere and the friction and velocity causes the spectacular show of fireball in the dark. Such phenomenon goes on around the year but such a large trail spotted on October 3 are rare,” Raka said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/experts-rule-out-farmers-claim-of-meteorite-fall-in-osmanabad/articleshow/86817320.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Allahabad||HC to Govt: Remove all encroachmentsfrom Chandrashekhar Azad Park in 3 days||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to remove, within three days, all the encroachments including graves, mazars or mosque constructed or created within the area of the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Prayagraj, which was earlier known as Alfred Park. Besides, the court, while referring to an apex court ruling in the case of Allahabad Ladies Club Versus Jitendra Nath Singh and others (2007) 11 SCC 609, directed the authorities that all illegal encroachments in the park that came up after 1975 should be demolished. Hearing a PIL filed by Jitendra Singh Visen and another, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Piyush Agrawal directed to list this PIL on October 8, 2021 as fresh for further arguments enabling the UP government authorities to produce the report after removing all encroachments after taking note of the judgment and directions of the apex court in the case of Allahabad Ladies Club (supra) and another. In the case of Allahabad Ladies Club, the apex court had taken into account various provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Parks, Playgrounds and Open Spaces (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1975 and said, “no park, playground or space shall except with the previous sanction of the prescribed authority be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was used on the date immediately preceding the date of commencement of the said Act.” This clearly meant that if on the date of commencement of the Act a park, playground, or open space was being used for a particular purpose, the same can be continued, however, no further ‘illegal’ encroachment could be allowed to continue as per Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Act. In the PIL, the petitioners alleged that for the last few years, the members of the Muslim community in their usual manner of capturing the land for their religious purposes were trying to construct a mosque within the parking area and some artificial mazars (graveyards) have been created at the instance of fundamentalists and the patronage of the Waqf Board. It was also contended that the government or the Waqf Board had never issued any public notice for registering any portion of the parkland as Waqf property. It alleged that the building illegally raised is being tried to be converted into a mosque. It was further alleged that the Waqf Board without issuing any notice and giving any opportunity of hearing to members of the public and the affected persons in a celandine manner declared an area of the park land as Waqf property and that it does not confer any right or title on any person/s in pursuance of such illegal registration. The court passed these directives on October 5 that came to limelight on October 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-to-govt-remove-all-encroachmentsfrom-chandrashekhar-azad-park-in-3-days/articleshow/86819888.cms||---

---||India||Corbett may no longer remain Corbett||DEHRADUN: The iconic Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand may be renamed as ‘Ramganga National Park’ following a visit by Union minister of state for environment, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, who has sought a proposal in this regard from the state forest department. The park’s director, Rahul (who only uses his first name), told TOI on Wednesday that a proposal for the name change will be prepared after a discussion with relevant stakeholders. TimesViewRenaming has been part of a national political game for decades now. The talk of renaming Jim Corbett Park as Ramganga falls in the same category of appropriation. Jim Corbett was a legendary hunter turned conservationist and writer. Even today he remains a fond figure in the hills of Kumaon and Garhwal. It would be better if India’s first national park, in the founding of which he played a crucial role, retains his name.Between 1954 and 1956, the tiger reserve was called ‘Ramganga National Park’ — after the Ramganga river that flows through it — before it was renamed in a tribute to noted hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett. When the park was first set up in 1936, it was known as Malcolm Hailey Park after the first Lt Governor of the United Provinces. Forest officials were accompanying the Union minister on Sunday when he visited the Dhangari museum to mark ‘Azadi Ka Mahotsav’ and later suggested that the park’s name should be changed. A senior Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer said the minister learnt about Corbett’s old name during his visit to the museum and thought it accurately represented the river, Ramganga, which is the lifeline for many animals in the reserve. The park boasts of having the highest tiger density in the wild — at 14 tigers per 100 sq km — in the world. During his visit, Choubey wrote the park’s name as ‘Ramganga National Park’ in the visitors’ book kept in the museum. A source told TOI that Choubey has also discussed the matter with the minister of state for tourism and Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt who gave his in-principle consent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/corbett-may-no-longer-remain-corbett/articleshow/86825891.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Lucknow||Sale of masks, sanitisers ebbs as Lucknow drops guard||LUCKNOW: Sale of masks and sanitisers has dropped drastically in the city in the past two months, indicating that people are dropping their guard which experts say is an open invitation to the third wave of the Covid-19. A survey by TOI of medical stores revealed that the sale of masks and sanitisers has gone down by over 90% in comparison to April-June when the second wave was razing through the city. Shopkeepers said that as Covid cases have dropped drastically, people have presumed that the pandemic has fizzled away. TimesViewFestival season has begun. Unlike last year, Covid-19 cases are negligible this time and there are less restrictions on celebrations, but this does not mean that we can throw all safety precautions to the winds. The laxity of people, as revealed in the TOI reality check, may prove very costly. Hence, we all must take a pledge to follow all necessary Covid protocols and guidelines advised by experts."Earlier we used to sell around 2,000 masks daily, but now the sale has dropped to about 60-70 per day. The demand for sanitizers, too, has gone down,” said Vinod Shukla, owner of a medical store chain with its headquarters in Gole Market, Mahanagar. Sikhar Agrawal, who owns a small pharmacy in Patrakarpuram, said "People used to buy masks and sanitisers regularly. But now most customers prefer to buy only one or two masks so that they can use it at venues where Covid protocol is mandatory”. SN Malik, owner of a leading medical store in Aminabad, said that the sale of masks and sanitisers has dropped by 95%. "Now rarely any customer comes to buy N95 masks, which earlier used to sell within no time,” said a pharmacist in Indira Nagar. KD Agrawal, who owns three medical shops in Gomtinagar, said that stocks of masks and sanitisers have been lying unsold for a few weeks. Experts pointed out that the daily cases in Lucknow had dropped below 10 in March. But all of sudden there was a spike and within a month the city started recording thousands of cases every day. Meanwhile, Prof Virendra Atam, head, medicine, KGMU, said: “People need to understand that in case a new Covid variant develops, it will take just a few days for the third wave to take the city into its grip. We need to realise that masks and sanitisers are a must till scientists declare that the pandemic is now under control.” Prof Manodeep Sen of microbiology, RMLIMS said that vaccination does not mean that a person cannot contract infection. People need to take extra precautions. “A breakthrough infection in a vaccinated person can result in mutation and the new variant can be more dangerous than the one that caused havoc during the second wave,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sale-of-masks-sanitisers-ebbs-as-city-drops-guard/articleshow/86821484.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Mahalaya marks beginning of Durga Puja||Lucknow: Durga Puja festivities began in Bengali households on Wednesday with people waking up to the 90-year-old musical recital of ‘Mahishasur Mardini’, marking the auspicious occasion of Mahalaya. Mahalaya is celebrated every year on the last day of Pitrapaksha. It is believed that Maa Durga begins her journey from the mountains with her kids Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartikey and Ganesha to bless people. Several families listened to the recital on the radio for old time sake, while others tuned into YouTube or their smartphones. Madhu Banerjee, a devotee, said, “We not just welcome Maa Durga with prayers and chants but we think that we are inviting Devi from the Himalayas to our hearts,” she added. Tuhina Srivastava, principal of a private school in the city, listened to the Chandi path which she composed herself with her siblings last year during Covid-19 lockdown. “Earlier, we used to visit the Bengali Club to participate in Chandi path and ‘aavahan’ mantra. During Covid we decided to utilise our time at home and recorded the path with my siblings which later my husband helped in composing it with music through our home production. Early this morning today it was telecast on Gyanvani,” she said. “Mahalaya always brings happiness to me with the thought of festivities lined up after the very day and also the change of weather and blooming aparajita flowers,” said Anoop Ghosh, treasurer of Ansh Durga Samiti. “This year I along with my entire family watched the Mahalaya special show on a leading television channel. It brought us happiness by marking the beginning of Durga Puja,” added Tithi Chaudhary, a teacher by profession. Subhanjana Sarkar, a college student took a nostalgic tour to her childhood. “My cousins and I used to eagerly wait for Mahalaya. There was a time when families would come together to listen to Chandi path in Birendra Krishna Bhadra’s baritone voice. Years down the line, Mahalaya is still about my childhood nostalgia,” said Sarkar. “The windows of our house and even that of our neighbours were kept open, so that the sound of Mahisasuramardini could reverberate in the morning air. We tuned in to YouTube to hear the entire Chandi path,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mahalaya-marks-beginning-of-durga-puja/articleshow/86821457.cms||---

Some of these documents included panchanama, inquest, spot panchanama and chemical analyser reports, seizure memos and medical notification, among others. Special prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi told TOI, “The court directed the CBI to furnish a list of witnesses at the next hearing on October 13. The CBI also gave a 27 volume exhaustive case diary (which has recorded minutest of developments till date ever since the crime took place) to the court.” Special judge SR Navander, hearing the case, also sought a report from the Yerawada jail authorities on key accused Virendrasinh Tawde’s plea to allow him to have a telephonic conversation with his sister living in Vadodara, Gujarat. The jail authorities have so far not allowed such conversation on the grounds that his sister’s number will have to be verified first. Avhad told TOI, “Tawde’s sister had approached the Vadodara police for getting her number verified, but she was told that such a verification can be done only as per the court’s order.” The defence lawyers again raised the issue of physical production of all the accused at the hearings to enable them take instructions. Both, Suryavanshi and Avhad, said the court was exploring the possibility of commencing the trial from a facility in Yerawada jail or from the Ashoka hall of the district and sessions court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dabholkar-case-defence-denies-all-cbi-documents/articleshow/86819887.cms||Vishwas Kothari

---||Patna||Mother and sister of Saran loot case accused commit suicide out of shame||PATNA: In a shocking incident, the mother and sister of a man accused of Rs40 lakh loot committed suicide out of humiliation and shame after the police raided their house in Saran district on Tuesday night and recovered Rs6 lakh, a countrymade pistol, five live cartridges and the bike used in the crime. Bike-borne criminals had looted Rs40 lakh from one Bal Mukund Kumar alias Mukund Pathak near Israuli petrol outlet on the Maraurha-Chhapra road under Maraurha police station area in Saran when he was on way to load the cash in different bank ATMs in the district on Monday afternoon. Sonu Pandey (23), one of the five accused in the case, is evading arrest. His father, Chandeshwar Pandey (45), was arrested after the raid on their house at Khardaha Tola Jalalpur under Bheldi police station area in Saran. Sonu’s mother Sanju Devi (40) and his sister Rupa Kumari (18) were found hanging in their house when the villagers went inside after noticing no movement on Wednesday morning. None of their relatives were coming forward even to claim the bodies after postmortem and cremate them, police sources said. Police recovered a two-page suicide note allegedly written by Rupa in which she has blamed Sonu’s antisocial activities which maligned their “izzat” (reputation) in society. “It seems both committed suicide on Tuesday night. Their bodies were hanging from a nylon rope tied to a wooden plank in the roof. Rupa wrote in the suicide note that they had tried hard on several occasions to convince Sonu to shun such activities, but failed. Rupa has also mentioned in the note that their father is innocent and he always wanted to educate and see his children as officers,” Marhaura SDPO Indrajeet Baitha said. “She has also mentioned that Sonu changed his behaviour only after eloping with a girl for which he even faced a kidnapping case. She also wrote that all his acts maligned the family’s reputation in society,” he added. Sources said it was Chandeshwar who himself handed over all the items to police. They said Chandeshwar’s arrest might have broken the morale of the mother-daughter duo after which they committed suicide. Baitha said the bike used by Sonu in the crime was registered in the name of his mother. He said none of their relatives have come forward even after being informed by the police to claim the bodies or to even give a statement. “Police would register a case of unnatural death and cremate the bodies,” he added. Meanwhile, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar on Wednesday said one Ashu Rai was also arrested along with Chandeshwar. Five criminals were involved in the loot, the ADG said at a presser in Patna. “Altogether Rs18.28 lakh of the looted money has been recovered. Four criminals are evading arrest. Police recovered Rs6 lakh each from the residences of Sonu, Ashu and one Shailesh Pathak and Rs28,500 from the house of one Mintu Kumar,” he said. Gangwar said police would put up the case for speedy trial. He said police would conduct separate investigation in the double-suicide case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mother-and-sister-of-saran-loot-case-accused-commit-suicide-out-of-shame/articleshow/86819900.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Aurangabad||HC urges state to delete rule empowering relaxation in two kid mandate for govt employees||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has expressed its “dissatisfaction and disapproval” of the Rule 6 under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Declaration of Small Family) Rules, 2005, which provides for relaxation in the small family (only two children) mandate for government employees and has “requested” the state government to delete the Rule 6. In a judgment on September 24, the HC bench of Justice Ravindra V Ghuge and S G Mehare also asked the state government to “make the 2005 Rules applicable uniformly to all employees of the Government, State instrumentalities, local authorities and local bodies, if the laudable object of controlling the growth of population is to be achieved.” The bench said, “We find such rule to be not only unwarranted, but harmful for the reason that on the one hand, this country is grappling with the problem of population explosion and by introducing the 2005 Rules, the State of Maharashtra has taken a progressive step to control the problem and encourage the people to have a small family of only two children. On the other hand, these rules are not made applicable to the employees of the local authorities though similar provisions are made applicable to the persons who seek election to the Gram Panchayat, Municipality and Zilla Parishad, by introducing the disqualification clause.” “In this backdrop, Rule 6 permitting the government to relax the mandate of small families would be counter-productive. So also, these rules need to be made applicable even to the employees of the local authorities like the gram panchayat,” the bench said. The matter arose from a petition filed by a peon from the Karetakali gram panchayat in Shevgaon taluka of Ahmednagar district, challenging a show cause notice of December 26, 2019 asking him to explain why action should not be initiated against him for having more than two children. A woman from the gram panchayat had on July 11, 2019 sought the peon’s removal from service _ in view of a government notification of March 28, 2005 that introduced the Rules of 2005 with a prospective effect _ claiming he had three sons. In the petition the peon pleaded, Rule 5 of the 2005 Rules clearly stated that the rules cannot be applied with a retrospective effect. He pleaded that he was appointed by a gram sevak in March 2004 i.e. before the rules were introduced, and he was not a state employee but a gram panchayat employee where the rules cannot be applied. The HC had appointed lawyer Ajay S Deshpande as amicus curiae (friend of the court) to give his opinion on the larger issue of applicability of the Rules of 2005 and on the issues raised by the petitioner. While the additional government pleader, appearing for the state and the zilla parishad, and the lawyer for the gram panchayat had opposed the petition on the grounds that the same cannot be entertained at the stage of a show cause notice, amicus curiae Deshpande submitted that though the employees of the gram panchayat may not be the employees of the Government of Maharashtra, considering the Panchayat Raj system introduced by the Constitutional amendment, the small family principle needs to be implemented at all levels and should be applied to all families, irrespective of falling in different strata of the society. As local authorities are covered by the definition of the “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution of India and since the salaries of the employees of the gram panchayat are borne by the Government, which reimburses the amount from the Rural Development Department, the state is required to initiate steps to include such employees under the 2005 Rules so as to implement the small family principle throughout the country without an exception, Deshpande submitted. The HC acknowledged the amicus curiae’s views while recommending to the government to delete Rule 6, it also directed the competent authority which issued the show cause notice to the peon to proceed in accordance with law and decided if the 2005 Rules are applicable to the petitioner||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-urges-state-to-delete-rule-empowering-relaxation-in-two-kid-mandate-for-govt-employees/articleshow/86817396.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The senior officer is closely monitoring the investigation in the alleged murder. The post mortem report of the deceased Arav Rajesh Kesarkar shows he was strangled. He had been missing for a couple of days and his body was found near his parent’s old house on Tuesday morning. The boy’s body was coloured with ‘ceremonial’ colours (turmeric, kunku and gulal), which hinted towards a case of human sacrifice. Anti-superstition activists and local residents demanded the police investigate the angle of human sacrifice. Balkawade said, “So far, there is no major development in the investigation into the case. However, we are trying our best. We couldn’t record the statement of close relatives, especially the boy’s mother as she is unstable since the incident happened. We are certain that there is no angle of human sacrifice. Putting colours on the body seems to be an attempt to divert the focus of investigation.” The officer has appointed eight teams, including cybercrime and technical experts. Each team includes four policemen and is led by a senior officer of the particular domain. An officer of deputy superintendent of police level has been asked to stay at the village round-the-clock. Balkawade said the timely review of the progress in the investigation is being taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/human-sacrifice-angle-ruled-out-in-5-year-old-boys-murder/articleshow/86817370.cms||---
---||Lucknow||SP doing politics over dead bodies, Pawar should recall 1994 Nagpur bloodbath: BJP||Lucknow: BJP stepped up attack on SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, accusing him of doing “politics over dead bodies and shedding crocodile tears” for farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri. BJP’s counter offensive comes a day after Akhilesh tweeted — UP is mourning killings of farmers, this is not the time for a festival — in an apparent reference to PM’s Narendra Modi inauguration of New Urban India conference as part of 75th year of independence in Lucknow. State government spokesperson, Sidharthnath Singh said, spreading anarchy in the state was the “core character and identity” of Samajwadi Party. He said chief minister Yogi Adityanath has announced a judicial inquiry for a fair and speedy investigation into the unfortunate incident. “The government will also get to the bottom of incident and track what triggered the tragedy. Whoever is guilty will not be spared,” Singh reiterated. He said, Rs 45 lakh aid was given to families of each deceased farmer and Rs 10lakh to the injured. Also, a government job has been announced for dependents of deceased farmers, he said. “It was because of efficient management of the situation by CM Yogi Adityanath that Akhilesh could not get political mileage. This is the reason of their grief. We can recall how the entire nation was shocked when SP supported terrorists involved in Varanasi blasts,” said Singh. The CM has expressed grief for what happened in Kheri. Every demand of the farmers has been accepted, he added. Reacting to NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s remarks on the Kheri incident, Singh said Pawar should remember the heart-wrenching 1994 Nagpur stampede in which 114 persons from the Gowari community were killed and 500 injured after a police lathicharge. Expressing concern over Pawar’s remark in which he equated the Lakhimpur Kheri incident to Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Singh said, Pawar government had not even expressed regret over what happened during his tenure as CM and instead of helping the downtrodden, he had suppressed them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-doing-politics-over-dead-bodies-pawar-should-recall-1994-nagpur-bloodbath-bjp/articleshow/86821513.cms||Pankaj Shah

As the news spread fast and thick in the village and entire region, a large crowd gathered at the riverbank to retrieve the plants from water. However, police too got a whiff of the goings on and immediately asked the villagers to leave the area empty-handed. Later, cops pulled out the remaining plants found floating in the waters and seized entire stock of contraband weighing 2.4kg. Police have registered a case under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act against unidentified person at Naswadi police station. “We suspect that the farmer who must have grown the plants at his farm may have uprooted the crop for fear of getting nabbed. We are checking farms upstream for evidence,” said a police official. Local sources said that cops could not collect all the plants from the river as many plants got dragged away in the current.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/marijuana-plants-floating-in-river-shock-villagers/articleshow/86818829.cms||---

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, along with Congress representative Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda visited the families of farmers who were killed. The Congress representatives arrived at Bhagwantnagar, where one of the farmers who died, Lovepreet Singh, 20, lived, around 9.30pm. It was the first stop on their route. “I only had one thing to ask for — I demanded justice for my son. She (Priyanka Gandhi) said she would fight for me,” Lovepreet’s father Satnam Singh told TOI after the Congress representatives left. They were headed for Nighasan to meet the family of local news channel journalist Raman Kashyap, who was also killed in Sunday’s violence. Earlier in the day, roads to the Chaudhary Charan Singh International (Lucknow) Airport had been barricaded, with police and CISF deployed while hundreds of Congress workers gathered. Rahul had announced he would be in Lakhimpur Kheri. By the time his flight reached the Unnao airspace, Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash and other police officials had reached the airport. “We received the Congress leaders and informed them that only five people could travel to Lakhimpur Kheri as prohibitory orders are in place,” the DM said. Rahul was travelling with Baghel, Channi, and party secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. When they were told they had to travel to Sitapur, where Priyanka had been detained over the past two days, in government vehicles, the Congress representatives protested. “Police stopped us at the airport even after the UP government’s permission to travel to Sitapur en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. They are forcing us to board government vehicles, but we won't,” Rahul told reporters there. Congress workers joined the dharna. Around 3.15pm, the district administration told them they could travel in their own vehicles. They met Priyanka at Sitapur around 5pm and, from there, left for Lakhimpur Kheri. AAP MP Sanjay Singh also visited Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. Around 8.30pm, he reached Nighasan and met journalist Kashyap’s brother Pawan. He made him speak to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. “I will fight for your justice,” the latter told Pawan. Rajasthan Congress MLA and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot, however, could not make it to Lakhimpur Kheri after being stopped at Moradabad. He tweeted, “This evening @AcharyaPramodk ji & I were detained in Moradabad while en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. We didn’t break any provisions of the law. These undemocratic steps of UP Govt will not deter us. We’ll raise our voice for justice for the deceased farmers & their families.” SP president Akhilesh Yadav and BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra are scheduled to visit the families on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-finally-allows-entry-into-kheri-priyanka-rahul-visit-farmers-families/articleshow/86818782.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid-weary Kolkata looks forward to make most of Puja break||KOLKATA: The biggest festival of the year is here but it doesn’t quite seem to promise the old excitement and unbridled joy amid the fear of the virus lurking around. This year, too, entry into pandals will be barred and the crowd of revellers thin, as suburban trains won’t run. The night restrictions have been lifted, paving the way for nocturnal pandal-hopping, but other curbs will ensure the puja revelry doesn’t really take on its usual proportions this year. A large section of Kolkatans has already decided not to venture out on the streets. But others are ready to make the most of the annual festival, which comes at the end of a gruelling summer, a ruthless Covid second wave sweeping through the country, and a wet monsoon. They have, however, decided to celebrate with caution, keeping a safe distance from gatherings, given the warning about a possible Covid third wave striking soon. Experts and doctors stuck to their assumption that the Pujas would be followed by a spurt in Covid cases, albeit small, thanks to vaccination. Sunando Banerjee, a businessman from south Kolkata, says like last year, he will take his family out on a fun ride, enjoying the festivity, decorations, lights and pandals from a distance. “We don’t want to miss this once-a-year festival but will not jostle with pandal-hoppers,” says Banerjee. Techie Souvick Basu, who usually has plans with separate groups of friends on each day, had spent the last Puja in his bedroom. “This time, I have planned two small outings. For the first two days, I will be in Raichak and the next two days I will join other friends in Jhargram,” says Basu. But bank employee Soumya Mukherjee, who will return to Kolkata from Bangalore later this week, wants to enjoy with his family and friends like before. “We could not visit Kolkata with our 4-year-old son last year owing to the novel coronavirus. But now that Covid cases are under control, I plan to enjoy my para pujo in Behala and go pandal-hopping with my family and son but, of course, will maintain caution. On Nabami and Dashami, we will be at my in-laws’ place in New Town, where the complex will have cultural programmes,” Mukherjee says. People do need something to look forward to in these gloomy times, says mythologist Nrisinghaprasad Bhaduri. “This is an annual festival that we all wait for throughout the year. Durga Puja is not merely about those four days. The preparations begin much earlier, with people flocking to markets for shopping, making their plans for Ashtami, Nabami and so on. The enjoyment has been curbed by Covid but let’s not shun the festivities altogether. We can still celebrate with caution,” says Bhaduri. There might be more people on the streets till late into the night, feels restaurateur Nitin Kothari, who owns Mocambo and Peter Cat on Park Street. “Since entry into pandals has been barred, a large section might be dissuaded from pandal-hopping, a favourite puja activity. A majority of them will invariably look for alternative entertainment and eating out tops the list during the festival. So, I expect a larger turnout, especially in late evenings,” says Kothari. “Kolkatans know their food and love it. So, the festive spirit will be there, unlike last year, when the scare was bigger. Only the celebrations may take on a slightly different form.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-weary-kol-looks-forward-to-make-most-of-puja-break/articleshow/86819902.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Sen questioned BJP’s various failure including that of providing employment for youth and state-of-the-art infrastructure for the tourism industry. Mamledar said that while TMC will target the government, Congress too would be hit badly. “BJP is worst than the previous government. It has looted the country. Issues are unending.

---||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi reach ground zero Lakhimpur Kheri||LUCKNOW: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was released after a three-day confinement at PAC headquarters in Sitapur, joined brother Rahul Gandhi to visit ground zero Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday along with three other Congress leaders, but not before an hour-long high-octane drama at Lucknow airport after Rahul Gandhi refused to board a government vehicle. Rahul took the Lucknow flight at 12:45pm en route to Lakhimpur Kheri, following UP government’s decision at noon to allow entry of politicians in groups of five. While Congress chief ministers of Punjab and Chhattisgarh, Chiranjeet Singh Channi and Bhupesh Baghel and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda accompanied the Gandhi siblings to Kheri, Rajasthan Congress leader Sachin Pilot was detained at Moradabad. Both Channi and Baghel announced a combined compensation of Rs 1crore each to families of deceased farmers in Tikunia village, where eight persons were killed in violence after an SUV ploughed through protesting farmers last Sunday. Soon after Rahul Gandhi’s announcement in Delhi of his Lakhimpur Kheri visit, roads to Lucknow airport were barricaded and the airport terminal fortified by police and a CISF platoon even as hundreds of slogan-shouting Congress workers trooped into the Amausi airport area. By the time Rahul’s flight entered Unnao airspace, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash and other police officials reached the airport. Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash said, “We received the Congress leaders and informed them only five people could travel to Lakhimpur Kheri as prohibitory orders have been imposed in the district.” After Rahul Gandhi touched down with Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, party general secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala, sparks flew after they were escorted to the lounge and purportedly told to travel in government vehicles to Sitapur. Spurning the diktat, Rahul along with Baghel, Channi and Venugopal sat on a dharna inside the airport premises. “Police have stopped us at the airport even after UP government’s nod to travel to Sitapur en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. They are forcing us to board government vehicles, but we won’t,” Gandhi told reporters. Congress workers too joined protest outside the airport. Earlier, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI that the government has imposed restrictions on travel to Kheri to maintain law and order. Anybody can visit Kheri, but only in a group of five or less.” By 3:15 pm, the district administration blinked and Congress leaders were told to travel in their own vehicles to Sitapur, where they joined Priyanka Gandhi after 5pm. From there, Gandhi siblings along with Baghel, Channi and Hooda left for Lakhimpur Kheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-released-from-sitapur-guesthouse-rahul-3-other-congmen-go-to-ground-zero-kheri/articleshow/86821505.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The party is mulling how the rally can be held with a limited crowd and following Covid-19 protocols.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said the party won’t just have an online event and is likely to hold a rally on Dussehra, October 15. “The Dussehra rally will happen and it will not just be an online event. We feel that the rally should be held properly like it used to be held. Uddhavji also has a similar view. We are discussing how the rally can be organized by following the Covid protocols and norms.

---||Ahmedabad||‘His Ravan was flawed human, not demon’||Whenever a character in Ramanand Sagar’s blockbuster TV series "Ramayan" addressed Lord Ram as ‘Shri Ramchandra’, the ten-headed figure of Ravan, played by Gujarati actor Arvind Trivedi, would react arrogantly. Ravan would say: "Shri mat kaho usey." (Don’t use the respectful prefix of shri for him). However, those who knew Trivedi cherished his abiding humility. "Ravan’s character has been portrayed by a number of actors in India before and after Trivedi’s role of Lankesh in the late eighties," said Mahesh Champaklal, professor emeritus, MSU. "I always remember him not only as a versatile theatre, movie, and television actor but also as a very humble person." Trivedi’s portrayal of this character is the most remembered one in the country as he may have for the first time added some humanness to it, said Professor Champaklal who headed the faculty of performing arts at MSU till 2013. Professor Champaklal said Trivedi understood that stardom can make a person arrogant. He added: "Though he was a star, I have always known Arvindbhai as a very low-profile person." Professor Champaklal said that Trivedi retained his humility even after he became famous. "In 1989, the Vadodara-based Triveni Theatre group, established by well-known theatre artist Markand Bhatt, wanted to felicitate Trivedi," said Prof Champaklal. "We explained that we won’t be able to give him airfare as we are a small organization. He came at his own expense." Role of Lanka Naresh changed his life Arvind Trivedi shot to national fame in the role of Ravan in Ramanand Sagar’s "Ramayan" that aired in 1987-88. He was born in Ujjain to a Gujarati family belonging to Kukadiya village in Idar taluka of Banaskantha.Trivedi, 82, passed away late on Tuesday night at his home in Kandivali, Mumbai. He had been ailing for long with age-related issues, according to his nephew and Gujarati theatre producer Kaustubh Trivedi. The brother of veteran Gujarati actor Upendra, Trivedi also acted in other popular teleseries such as "Vikram Aur Betaal" and "Vishwamitra", and over 300 Gujarati and Hindi films. In 1991, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Sabarkantha constituency on a BJP ticket, and served the full term. He worshipped Lord Ram Professor Mahesh Champaklal said that Arvind Trivedi was a religious man. "He was an ardent worshipper of Lord Ram," he said. "He became more humble after playing Ravan. He started wearing dhoti and kurta and had rudraksh beads around his neck."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/his-ravan-was-flawed-human-not-demon/articleshow/86819967.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Traders say that prices would go up further if the rain continues as the demand is more due to less supply.. Onions for the Madurai markets come from Maharashtra, Karnataka and the neighbouring districts of Tenkasi and Dindigul. President of the Paravai vegetable market association, S Manuel Sekharan, said that the prices were increasing because the season has ended in Maharashtra which produced the first quality onions. “The next season begins only in February and the next few months will see the price of onions going up,” he said. The Paravai market, which supplies vegetables to six southern districts, receives about 300 tonnes of onions every day, but now it has dropped to less than 200 tonnes, hence the hike in prices. Ganesha Pandi, a wholesale onion vendor in East Marret Street in Madurai blamed the rains for the price rise. “Now is the harvest time and when it rains during this time, the bulbs become soggy. This pushes up the prices of the dry onions manifold,” he said. “The new onions would soon start arriving in the market, but the demand will be for the old stock which is dry. It would not be surprising if the price goes above Rs 100 per kg in the next two weeks,” said Sudalai Muthu, a trader. “This is not the best quality. If you really wanted the big onions with silky skins and dry, they would cost Rs 80 per kg, but they cannot be sold in the local market,” said M Hussai, a vendor in Anna Nagar. In the Mattuthavani market also the onions sold at Rs 40 to Rs 50 wholesale price and it is expected to increase further said merchants. However, shallots were in good supply an they were sold for just Rs 20 a kg in the wholesale market on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/onion-prices-shoot-up-due-to-rain-induced-short-supply/articleshow/86821543.cms||---

Although the hospital has recently been given equipment worth Rs 7 lakh under corporate social responsibility (CSR), it lacks expertise and required manpower. Sources said that the old Chicalim hospital used to undertake minor operations. But ever since it has shifted to the new structure designating it as a sub district hospital, it has neither received equipment nor expertise to commence the operation theatre. In fact, many politicians had assured that it would make arrangements to provide better health facilities at the hospital for people from the three constituencies -Mormugao, Vasco and Chicalim. Sources told TOI that the hospital requires a surgeon, anaesthetist, a few nurses and multi-tasking staff. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation has been directed to complete certain civil works such as drainage system so that the hospital can kickstart its operation theatre. The hospital is now planning to start with minor operations like family planning and cesarean deliveries if they get the expertise. They have been told by the Directorate of Health Services that the required expertise will be provided on alternate basis even if not round-the-clock. Parshuram Sonurlekar of NGO ‘Goa First’ said that, “When we have a huge hospital built at the cost of taxpayers money, why are people of Vasco forced to go to far off places for surgeries? The families have to travel, make arrangements before shifting the patients to distant places, repeatedly visit the OPD of the hospital where the surgery was conducted, etc, when the government can easily make the doctors available here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-hosps-operation-theatre-awaits-required-staff/articleshow/86821544.cms||Ruvina Khan

The Azad Maidan unit of the ANC got a tip-off about the two coming on October 4 to supply drugs. Police laid a trap on Monday morning and arrested Hakeem Gul Khan, 56, and Jeevanlal Bherulal Meena, 29. Khan was carrying 4.5 kg and only 500g was with Meena.

Singh said, “The Congress ‘Yuvraj’ staged the drama despite getting permission to go to Lakhimpur Kheri.” “He always does callous politics on sensitive issues and incidents like the one in Lakhimpur. They have nothing to do with the farmers, never care for their interests,” Singh added. “Why Rahul Gandhi did not show same concern for the farmers of Rajasthan? The farmers there were injured recently in a brutal lathicharge ordered by the Congress government and had to be admitted to hospitals, but Rahul remained silent on their plight,” he said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had taken the Lakhimpur incident very seriously on the very first day and ordered strict action against the culprits after an impartial inquiry, said the state BJP president. Attacking other parties, including SP and BSP, Singh said the Opposition should stop its disgusting habit of doing vote bank politics over deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-yuvraj-staged-dramato-hog-media-headlines-bjp/articleshow/86821598.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lakhimpur Kheri violence won't impact poll prospects: Uttar Pradesh BJP chief||LUCKNOW: Undeterred by Opposition’s hardened stand on Lakhimpur Kheri violence that led to the death of eight persons, including four farmers, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Wednesday maintained the incident will not have an adverse fallout on BJP’s electoral prospects in any part of the state, including the politically restive west UP region in run-up to polls early next year. Speaking to TOI, Singh said the Opposition was mendaciously trying to turn a crisis into a political opportunity, but it “would not succeed” in denting BJP’s prospects in any corner of the state. The state BJP chief insisted various pro-farmer policies framed by the Modi government at the Centre and Yogi Adityanath government in UP have benefitted the farming community and brought it close to the ruling party. “Virodhi mahaul kharab kar lenge...par BJP kas nuksaan nahi kar payenge (Opposition can spoil the atmosphere of the state, but can’t cause any harm to BJP),” he said. Singh’s assertion assumed political importance in the backdrop of Opposition’s aggressive move to corner BJP over the incident which was, otherwise, deftly controlled by the state government machinery led by the CM. Political experts said, the Opposition was desperately seeking to turn the tables on the ruling BJP, which had plugged movement of political leaders, including Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and stopped them from reaching Lakhimpur Kheri at the peak of crisis. A senior BJP leader, however, admitted the alleged role of junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish, in mowing down protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri was certainly a “cause of worry”. In fact, some BJP leaders like party MP Varun Gandhi have been candid in terming the incident “unforgivable in any decent civilisation”. Sources said, BJP found itself in a spot after videos purportedly showing two SUVs ploughing through protesting farmers went viral. BJP, not surprisingly, has gone into a damage-control exercise. Sources said, the party has asked its farmer frontal wing to hammer out outreach programmes to consolidate the farming community. UP BJP Kisan Morcha president Kameshwar Singh said, functionaries of the frontal wing are in constant touch with farmers, assuaging them and telling them about various measures taken by the Centre and state government. He also confirmed that the ‘morcha’ was devising campaigns and programmes to consolidate farmers, which would be launched soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-will-have-no-impact-on-bjps-electoral-prospects-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/86821575.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Goa||Loutolim sarpanch disqualifed for renting panchayat shops||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has disqualified the present sarpanch of Loutolim panchayat, Inacio Fernandes, after former sarpanch Franky Monteiro filed a petition seeking his disqualification under the Goa Panchayat Raj Act. Monteiro submitted that the sarpanch took two shops on lease from the Loutolim panchayat where there was a contract between him and the panchayat, and hence he had a direct monetary interest in the contract, thus inviting disqualification under Section 10(f) of the Act. “A proper reading of the said provision would show that disqualification would be incurred if the person concerned has directly or indirectly a monetary interest in any contract by or on behalf of the panchayat. In the present case, there is no dispute about the fact that there are lease agreements executed between the panchayat and respondent no.1 under which the respondent no.1 is obliged to pay rent. This clearly indicates the monetary interest on the basis of lease agreements executed between the panchayat and the respondent no.1,”stated Justice Manish Pitale. The allegation against the sarpanch was that he had not paid lease rent towards shop number 1 in the old panchayat building from April 2009 onwards and for shop number 5 in the building from April 2012 onwards and was in arrears of rent, thereby incurring disqualification under Section 10 (d) of the Act. “There cannot be any doubt about the fact that an elected member and sarpanch of the panchayat would be in a position to influence the steps to be taken by the panchayat in a dispute with him in his personal capacity and such a conflict of interest and duty is the very mischief that is sought to be addressed by Section 10(f) of the said Act,” the order stated. “The moment there is a dispute between the two in respect of the said shops, there would certainly be a conflict between the interest and duty of the respondent no.1. In the facts of the present case, such a dispute has already arisen and the two parties are in conflict and contesting the dispute. It is such a situation, which is sought to be averted by Section 10(f) of the aforesaid Act, so that the purity of the responsibility with which an elected member in a representative democracy is expected to work, is not adversely affected and the entire process remains pure,” he added. It is not that a dispute must necessarily exist, but the likelihood of a conflict that could arise between the duty and interest of the elected member is enough to incur disqualification under Section10(f) of the said Act, the order further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/loutolim-sarpanch-disqualifed-for-renting-panchayat-shops/articleshow/86821559.cms||---

---||Mumbai||CR will resume AC locals in January once work on 5th, 6th line done||MUMBAI: In a bonanza for commuters, Central Railway is mulling to introduce all its new services with air-conditioned trains once the work of laying of the fifth and sixth lines is completed by January. At present, the fifth and sixth lines exist between LTT and Thane and also between Diva and Kalyan. Work on bridging this link is under progress between Thane and Diva. Central Railway’s general manager Anil Kumar Lahoti said, “Once we have fifth and sixth lines between LTT and Kalyan, we will have the path available to run more suburban services. Whatever services we introduce after completion of this work will be with air-conditioned (AC) locals.” According to the estimates prepared by Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), there is scope to run 86 more suburban services. Lahoti said, “The number of AC services will increase gradually.” A senior Central Railway (CR) official said, “This is a better option as we do not have to withdraw any non-AC service to accommodate AC service. Any withdrawal of non-AC service to replace the path with AC service could lead to a backlash from regular commuters.” At present, CR is running a total of 12 services on its Main line between CSMT and Kalyan. Some of these services originate from Kurla, Dadar, Thane and Dombivli. Currently, Central Railway has four air-conditioned trains in its fleet. It began running air-conditioned trains on the Mail line between CSMT and Kalyan from March 16 last year. Central Railway ran its first air-conditioned local train on the trans-harbour line, that connects Thane to Panvel, onJanuary 30 last year. However, air-conditioned services on the Main line and the Harbour line were stopped briefly due to lack of demand during the peak lockdown period. In an online survey, nearly 66 per cent of the approximately 37,000 respondents have affirmed that they are willing to switch to suburban trains with air-conditioned coaches if the railway authorities run these services regularly across Central Railway as well as Western Railway, Both, Central Railway and Western Railway are also planning to run partial air-conditioned local trains which will not have the first-class compartments. First-class passengers may then have to upgrade their first-class season tickets to the air-conditioned class.  A Western Railway official said, “We are of the view that semi-air-conditioned local trains can be run as a combination of nine non-AC and three AC in 12-car trains and in 15-car trains, nine non-AC and 6 AC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cr-will-resume-ac-locals-in-jan-once-work-on-5th-6th-line-done/articleshow/86822950.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Madurai||Over 70% vote in rural civic polls in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi||Tirunelveli: The first phase of polling in the rural local body elections held in ten panchayats of Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts on Wednesday was peaceful. Tirunelveli saw 70.36% turnout and Tenkasi 73.95% as voters queued up to elect their village panchayat ward member, village panchayat president, panchayat union ward councillor and district panchayat councillor. In Tirunelveli, polling was held in Ambasamudram, Cheranmahadevi, Papaakudi, Palayamkottai and Manur unions to elect 1,113 representatives from among 3,006 candidates. Nearly 500 voters of Madhudaiyarkulam village in Malaiyankulam panchayat under Cheranmahadevi panchayat union boycotted the polls in protest against the delay in opening a PDS shop in their locality. However, after the tahsildar promised to open the shop after the model code of conduct (MCC) is lifted, they gave up the protest after three hours. According to officials, though cooperatives minister I Periyasamy had consented to open the PDS shop, the MCC had by then come into effect. There were incidents of some aged voters picking up quarrels with election officials for handing over only three ballot papers, saying their relatives in nearby villages were given four. It took time for the officials to explain that a candidate was elected unopposed to one of the posts. Use of ballot papers instead of EVMs left some first-time voters confused as they are used to voting in EVMs for assembly and general elections. “Since we were given four different ballot papers it caused little confusion though it was amusing,” said Manjula. On information about voter bribing at Ariyakulam, police picked up a few people for questioning. In Tenkasi, the first phase polling in 754 booths was held to elect 1,259 representatives from among 3,327 candidates. But for minor altercations between party cadres there were no major incidents of violence. Polling continued beyond 8 pm at a few booths as tokens were issued to voters who thronged the them between 5 pm and 6 pm, though the election commission had announced that the last hour of polling was for the benefit of Covid-19 patients. Though many wore masks at the booths, a sizeable number did not. Radhakrishnan, 52, of Neduvayal who is contesting as an independent from ward no 7 in Kadayanallur panchayat union in Tenkasi, died at a private hospital in Tirunelveli on Tuesday night after he collapsed while campaigning on Friday. Officials said election would be cancelled only if a candidate from a recognised party died before the polls. Since Radhakrishnan is no more, voters in the booths of his ward were asked not to vote against his name. In the event of Radhakrishnan emerging winner, a by-election will be held later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/over-70-vote-in-rural-civic-polls-in-tirunelveli-tenkasi/articleshow/86821550.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Khaki’s softer side: Cops went out of the way to broker peace and pacify victims’ relatives in Lakhimpur Kheri||LUCKNOW: Acting on clear instructions from the chief minister’s office to take adequate steps to defuse tension and pacify the families of the farmers who lost their lives in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, the police brass left no stone unturned to keep the situation under control. A case in point was the situation when the authorities were left in a fix after the family of one of the deceased questioned the findings of the post-mortem examination which stated that no gun shot injury was found on the body. A panel of doctors from Lucknow hospitals flew down to Bahraich to conduct autopsy. Additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar, said: “A special chopper was arranged by the government and the panel of doctors from Lucknow landed in Bahraich on Tuesday night itself to conduct autopsy on body of a deceased farmer, Gurvinder Singh. The last rites were performed after getting the family’s consent on Wednesday morning.” The state government forwarded a report to the Union home ministry about the developments after which it was decided that the political parties would be allowed to visit Kheri. When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi landed at Lucknow airport on Wednesday, senior police officials informed him that he had been granted permission to visit Kheri. To avoid any tension, police commissioner DK Thakur reached the airport and met Gandhi, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Chhani and others to convey the decision to them. Talking to TOI, Thakur said Gandhi was requested to leave for Sitapur from the backside of the airport. “The police did not stop Gandhi or any other Congress leader,” he said. Later, officials of the Sitapur district administration met Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, who was lodged at the PAC guest house, and informed her that the state government had allowed her to meet the kin of the deceased farmers. Rahul Gandhi was allowed safe entry to the PAC premises in Sitapur. Inspector general, Lucknow, Laxmi Singh, reached the guest house and met the Congress leaders. Later, all the leaders left for Kheri. Earlier too, the police acted deftly to ensure to check the spread of tension to other parts of the state. In a tactical move, cops allowed only farmers’ leaders to enter Kheri and later struck a dialogue with the protesting farmers. Other opposition leaders were stopped from coming out of their residences in Lucknow as a precautionary measure. Even when Priyanka tried to give the cops a slip, she was stopped in Sitapur. Senior IPS officers from Lucknow, including ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar, camped in Kheri. Internet was snapped in sensitive districts to avoid rumour-mongering. “FIR was lodged against the minister’s son (Ashish Mishra) as soon as the complaint was received,” said IG, Lucknow, Laxmi Singh. The demands of protesting farmers were met and the families were given compensation of Rs 45 lakh each, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-cops-went-out-of-their-way-todefuse-tension-pacify-victims-kin/articleshow/86821626.cms||---

Similar visuals arrived from Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, Dadar. Kulwant Singh, vice-president, said the darbar may have been closed for months but their Covid relief work was not interrupted for a day. Haji Ali Dargah underwent an intensive scrub not only of the interiors but also the external ribbon of road that leads to it, said administrative officer Mohammed Ahmed Taher. Babulnath Mandir, Chowpatty, is enforcing Covid protocol earnestly. Senior administrative officer Mukesh Kanojia said, “The entrance to the shrine is barricaded, beyond which devotees may not proceed without a mask. Posters have been pasted in the premises urging people to not linger after finishing their prayers.” Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Bombay, is also parish priest of Our Lady of Rosary Church, Mazgaon. He said, “Thursday is a special day for us as it is the Feast of the most Holy Rosary. The Rosary is a Marian devotion that reflects on the life and mission of Jesus and the Birth of the Holy Church.” Approximately 150 people will attend a special recitation of the Rosary before mass, which is one-third of church capacity. Fr Venancio Mascarenhas, parish priest of St Joseph's Church, Belapur, said, “We will permit only two persons per bench.” Fr Michael Pinto, parish priest of Our Lady of Lourdes, Orlem, Malad, said the place was sanitised using a UVC lamp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-places-of-worship-in-city-sanitised-ready-to-open-doors-after-6-mths/articleshow/86819976.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Lucknow||NDA countdown will begin with BJP defeat in 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: The BJP’s defeat in the 2022 assembly elections in UP will come as a countdown for the saffron brigade led NDA at the Centre and eventually mark the end of a regime more ruthless and unjust than what Indians faced during the British rule, said Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday. Akhilesh said the manner in which the jeep belonging to son of the Union minister of state for home mowed down four farmers in Lakhimpur on October 3 and the failure of the government to arrest the accused clearly shows what the government's claim of zero tolerance towards crime and criminal actually means. The former UP CM is slated to visit Lakhimpur on Thursday to meet the family members of the farmers killed in the incident. Addressing a gathering after paying respects at the Bada Gurdwara Nanakpuri Sunsarghat in Shahjahanpur on the anniversary of Sant Baba Sukhdev Singh Ji Bhuriwale, Akhilesh recollected the contribution of the Sikh community in the freedom struggle and renewed his party’s resolve to stand with the community like he stood in the past. Attacking the ruling BJP for turning a blind eye to the ongoing agitation of farmers against the farm laws, Akhilesh said the manner in which a jeep of a minister’s son has killed four farmers and no action has been initiated in the case explains the very intention of people in power. “UP is perhaps the only state in India where police officers wanted for murder are absconding and so expecting justice from such a government is meaningless,” he said and added that UP is the only state where businessmen sleeping in a hotel room is beaten to death by policemen. The former UP CM said the only way to ensure justice to farmers, unemployed youths and the deprived class is to remove the BJP government at the Centre. “The countdown for the government at the Centre will begin with the defeat of the BJP government in UP in the 2022 elections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-nda-countdown-to-begin-with-bjp-defeat-in-state/articleshow/86821643.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The protest was staged near Thiruvalluvar statue on Panagal road. “Students, especially from rural backgrounds, are most affected due to NEET. We will continue protesting in various rural pockets of Madurai including Thirumangalam, Usilampatti, Melur, Othakadai and Sholavandhan,” said federation co-ordinator M B Pandian. The protesters included members of various leftist and dalit outfits and parties including CPI, CPM, SDPI and VCK. The state assembly had passed a bill on September 13 seeking to permanently exempt Tamil Nadu students from appearing for the NEET exam. However, the President is yet to give approval for the bill. “The state government’s efforts so far for getting TN exempted from NEET are welcome and they must not back down. NEET has killed the dreams of so many medical aspirants from financially-poor backgrounds. It has also been responsible for deaths of students. There must be an end to this,” said Pandian. The protesters also demanded for translation of the report in Tamil so that it can be made to reach those in rural areas better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/outfits-hold-rally-seeking-prez-nod-for-anti-neet-bill/articleshow/86821617.cms||---

---||Bareilly||UP finally allows entry into Kheri, Priyanka & Rahul visit farmers’ families||Lakhimpur Kheri/Lucknow: After two days of being denied entry, political representatives were finally allowed to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight had died on Sunday in violence during a farmers’ black flag protest against Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, along with Congress representative Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda visited the families of farmers who were killed. The Congress representatives arrived at Bhagwantnagar, where one of the farmers who died, Lovepreet Singh, 20, lived, around 9.30pm. It was the first stop on their route. “I only had one thing to ask for — I demanded justice for my son. She (Priyanka Gandhi) said she would fight for me,” Lovepreet’s father Satnam Singh told TOI after the Congress representatives left. They were headed for Nighasan to meet the family of local news channel journalist Raman Kashyap, who was also killed in Sunday’s violence. Earlier in the day, roads to the Chaudhary Charan Singh International (Lucknow) Airport had been barricaded, with police and CISF deployed while hundreds of Congress workers gathered. Rahul had announced he would be in Lakhimpur Kheri. By the time his flight reached the Unnao airspace, Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash and other police officials had reached the airport. “We received the Congress leaders and informed them that only five people could travel to Lakhimpur Kheri as prohibitory orders are in place,” the DM said. Rahul was travelling with Baghel, Channi, and party secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. When they were told they had to travel to Sitapur, where Priyanka had been detained over the past two days, in government vehicles, the Congress representatives protested. “Police stopped us at the airport even after the UP government’s permission to travel to Sitapur en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. They are forcing us to board government vehicles, but we won't,” Rahul told reporters there. Congress workers joined the dharna. Around 3.15pm, the district administration told them they could travel in their own vehicles. They met Priyanka at Sitapur around 5pm and, from there, left for Lakhimpur Kheri. AAP MP Sanjay Singh also visited Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday. Around 8.30pm, he reached Nighasan and met journalist Kashyap’s brother Pawan. He made him speak to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. “I will fight for your justice,” the latter told Pawan. Rajasthan Congress MLA and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot, however, could not make it to Lakhimpur Kheri after being stopped at Moradabad. He tweeted, “This evening @AcharyaPramodk ji & I were detained in Moradabad while en route to Lakhimpur Kheri. We didn’t break any provisions of the law. These undemocratic steps of UP Govt will not deter us. We’ll raise our voice for justice for the deceased farmers & their families.” SP president Akhilesh Yadav and BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra are scheduled to visit the families on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-finally-allows-entry-into-kheri-priyanka-rahul-visit-farmers-families/articleshow/86818872.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Award to crack drug cases raised 6-fold!||GANDHINAGAR: Even as there have been several seizures of narcotics from the state in the recent past, the state government convened a special meeting of top officers of various law enforcing agencies to chalk out a comprehensive action plan to counter the growing menace of drugs. The meeting, convened recently by minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi and chaired by CM Bhupendra Patel, was an exercise to identify areas where upgradation is required in terms of technology, skills and manpower, so that the drug menace can be countered more effectively. For the past several years, cops who crack drug cases are given a monetary reward of Rs 5,000. The government has decided to increase the award six times to Rs 30,000. This will be a morale booster for cps dealing with such cases, government sources informed. “We understand that there is a manpower crisis. There are technological aspects as well which need to be upgraded. We are working out a plan to control consumption of drugs and also the use of Gujarat’s ports and coastline in transportation of narcotics,” minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi said. He added that the decision to increase the reward from Rs 5,000 to 30,000 is a small step to boost the morale of those involved in tackling narcotics sale and transportation. “Besides, the government will also felicitate cops who assist in cracking narcotics related cases,” the minister said. On the training and technology upgradation front, special training modules will be held for policemen on how to work on narcotics cases. Besides, the government will upgrade its equipment to handle such cases more effectively. “Like prohibition, there will be a separate cell exclusively to deal with narcotics at various ports of the state,” Sanghavi said. In the recent past, there have been a number of instances, where ports and the coastline of Gujarat has been used by cartels to transport contraband like narcotics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/award-to-crack-drug-cases-raised-6-fold/articleshow/86819983.cms||---
---||Lucknow||When firebrand leader Rakesh Tikait donned role of firefighter to defuse tension in Lakhimpur Kheri||LUCKNOW: Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), who has emerged as a firebrand farmer leader for leading the protests against the three farm laws, showed the other side of his personality – that of a deft mediator – which helped the state government defuse tension in the aftermath of Lakhimpur Kheri incident. There are many in the Opposition who are terming Tikait as “unreliable” so far as his allegiance is concerned, there are others who believe that by acting as a negotiator between the farmers and the government, he proved that he is not playing into the hands of any political party but is concerned about the cause of the farmers. There might be some truth in both the opinions. Those who support the first theory corroborate their claims by digging into Tikait’s past and his political aspirations. Tikait joined the Delhi police in 1992 and resigned after a couple of years to join BKU. He unsuccessfully contested assembly elections from Khatauli seat in 2007 on Bahujan Kisan Dal (BKD) ticket with the support of the Congress party. In 2014, he contested the Lok Sabha election from Amroha on Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket. Tikait was appointed the spokesperson of BKU in 2018. His elder brother Naresh Tikait took over as BKU president after the death of their father and farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait in 2011. However, those supporting Tikait say had politics been his motive, he would not have rushed to Kheri and stay there for three days to ensure justice is meted out to the family of victims. Irrespective of diverse views on his motive, the fact that the Yogi Adityanath government reposed complete faith in Tikait has come as a surprise to many. According to sources, soon after Tikait announced his plan to visit Kheri, UP government officials contacted him and assured him that he would be provided a smooth passage. The idea was that since the issue was related to farmers, Tikait should not be stopped from reaching Kheri as any hindrance to his movement could further agitate the farmers. Even Tikait, who has a good rapport with many officials earlier posted in the West UP region, assured them that he believed that there should be peace in the region and no one should be allowed to take political advantage of the situation. Tikait reached Kheri on October 3 night and immediately started deliberations with officials. His main demands included Rs 1 crore compensation each to the next of kin of deceased farmers, a government job to one of the family members, FIR against Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and his son Ashish Mishra and the arrest of the accused. Sources said the government officials agreed to all the demands and kept on negotiating on the compensation amount. After several rounds of discussions, Rs 45 lakh ex gratia was agreed upon, they added. According to sources, at no point Tikait showed any aggression as he knew that such a behaviour could trigger tension. Tikait played a crucial role in bringing the situation back to normal. He even rushed to Bahraich to convince the family members of one of the deceased farmers who were not ready to perform the last rites. According to political analysts, Tikait’s role in Kheri will cement his position as a farmer leader as his image was that of a leader of only Jat farmers. On social media too, Tikait was being painted as a troublemaker but his mediation in the Kheri incident may change his image to that of a trouble-shooter, analysts said. Talking to media persons in Kheri on Wednesday, Tikait said role in Kheri notwithstanding, the farmers’ agitation would continue till the three farm laws were withdrawn by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-farmer-leader-tikait-turnedfirefighter-to-defuse-tension-in-kheri/articleshow/86821664.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ATS inches closer to drug mafia from Iran||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat anti-terrorism squad (ATS) is closing in on a drug lord identified as Imam Bakhsh from Konarak in Iran, whose seven aides were caught in a mid-sea operation with 30kg heroin by the cops and the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on September 18. The ATS released a picture of Imam Bakhsh who had sent the seven men — all from Iran, to deliver the drugs to Sri Lanka. But as Sri Lankan agencies were on high alert after some big seizures of heroin there, the crew members were told to be prepared for landing in Gujarat or Maharashtra and the drugs were supposed to be delivered to Punjab. “We have also obtained some phone numbers from the phones of the arrested crew members and have been trying to identify the callers from countries like Iran and Pakistan,” said an ATS officer. He said that along with Imam Bakhsh, who is the kingpin of the drugs business, two others – Khan Sahab from Iran, whose full name the crew members did not know, and one man from Pakistan, Ghulam, were also involved in the smuggling. The two, except Imam Bakhsh, are yet to be identified. The officer said that the crew members were kept unaware about the delivery point of the drugs and they stayed mid-sea for around three days. At that time, Gujarat ATS got the input and nabbed them with the help of ICG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ats-inches-closer-to-drug-mafia-from-iran/articleshow/86820081.cms||---
---||Pune||Places of worship ready to open doors for the devotees in Pune||PUNE: Religious places in the city are ready to welcome devotees with equal parts of joy and caution, after being shut for nearly 18 months. Preparations are being made with sanitisers, online slots, social distancing markers and mandatory masking. Mahesh Suryawanshi, treasurer, Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Mandir, Laxmi Road, said overhead sanitiser sprays have been installed inside the temple. “Devotees will be requested to maintain social distancing for which we have put strips on the floor. Sitting will not be allowed inside the temple. Devotees can book online appointments for abhishek for which they will be given a date and time slot and a separate entry/exit,” said Suryawanshi. Pallavi Bendre, trustee, Graamdevta Shree Tambdi Jogeshwari Mandir, Budhwar Peth, said, “We will not be distributing or accepting any prasad in accordance with the Covid-19 regulations. Only the darshan area will be open; other areas of the temple will be restricted.” . At St Anne’s Catholic Church in Solapur Bazar, the seats have been colour-coded to ensure social distancing. Parish priest Father Malcom Sequeira said there will be two exit points on the premises. “Being a weekday, we do not expect many people on Thursday, but on Sunday we will have services at 7.30am, 9am and 6.30pm to avoid crowding. We have also arranged for an anticipation service for Sunday to be held on Saturday evening,” said Sequeira. Father SA Louis, parish priest of St Patrick’s Cathedral, said a team of volunteers will check temperature at the gate, usher people to their seats and ensure they wear their masks throughout. “Fogging will be done before and after every service. We have asked elderly members and those who are unwell not to come, but to attend the service online. On benches which can seat eight people, we are allowing only three at a time.” Gurudwara Guru Nanak Darbar in Camp, popularly known as Hollywood Gurudwara, has arranged seating spaced five feet apart inside the darbar (main hall). “Masks are mandatory for entry. We will provide free masks to those who do not have one. We are also conducting a free vaccination on the premises from 9am to 12pm, where people of all faiths are welcome. Langar will be served by volunteers wearing gloves and all safety gear, with spaced seating. The microphone used to recite kirtan and pravachan will be covered by a mask which will be changed after every use,” said Mohindev Singh Khandari, PRO, Gurudwara Guru Nanak Darbar. At many mosques in the city, visitors have been requested to complete wazu (act of ablution before prayers) at their homes before they come for namaz. Siraj Bagwan, trustee and secretary at Roshan Masjid, Nanapeth, said, “We will offer alcohol-free sanitiser at the gate. We have put up boards and will make announcements to follow social distancing and safety protocols after every namaz. The premises will be sanitised after every namaz, and everyone will be required to wear masks on the premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/places-of-worship-ready-to-open-doors-for-the-devout/articleshow/86819985.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The dam now holds over 117.22 TMC water, which includes live storage of 53.57 TMC and 63.65 TMC of dead storage. The dam’s live stock had dropped to zero percent in June this year and water was being used from the dead storage. It is the fourth consecutive year when the Ujani dam’s stock has reached 100%. Officials from the state irrigation department said the dam’s catchments have reported good spells of rain in the last two days. A senior official said, “Though the stock has reached to 100%, there is no plan to initiate water discharge immediately. Water will be released if the inflow of water in the reservoir goes up significantly. At present, water inflow from upstream dams is less than 10,000 cusecs.” Apart from Ujani, the water storage of 18 dams in the Bhima basin was at 100% on Wednesday. The dams with 100% stock include those which supply water to Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ujani-dams-stock-hits-100-for-4th-year-in-a-row/articleshow/86819984.cms||Sarang Dastane

But many journalists are now trying to cross-question us to make us say that the farmers beat him to death. That did not happen,”Raman’s brother Pawan told TOI. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had earlier said that Kashyap would be counted among the farmer “martyrs”. “My brother was a journalist but we are a family of farmers. What Tikait said was right,” Pawan said. “I have not received the postmortem report … I was told that there’s a procedure to attach our complaint to another FIR that has already been lodged. The FIR by farmers is the one with which ours is being attached.” Earlier in the day, a video with Pawan’s allegations against the media had been shared widely. “They are trying to put words in our mouths. That farmers beat him up. We said that didn’t happen. But the politics over this doesn’t end,” he says in the video. “One journalist came and said the autopsy report states he died of injuries from being beaten up with sticks. I ended up getting into an argument with him. He said had I not been the journalist’s brother, he would not have spoken with the civility he had … The autopsy report is not here but they’re making up stories. I was there at the mortuary. I saw his injuries. He had not been beaten up with sticks.” When asked how the theory came about, Pawan says, “There was a WhatsApp forward, on the basis of which I was being asked these questions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/journos-family-says-media-pressuring-them-to-say-farmers-killed-him/articleshow/86818885.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu govt urged to deploy MGNREGA workers to clean private schools||MADURAI: The Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA) has written to minister for school education and principal secretary to the government (rural development and panchayati raj department) to deploy workers from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme to undertake cleaning work in private school campuses ahead of the reopening on November 1. According to M Arumugam, state president, FePSa, most schools had to let go of their workers as they remained closed and hence they are unable to get workers for cleaning work. “With maintenance work not being carried as schools were shut, school campuses are overgrowing with weeds and wild bushes. MGNREGA workers can be deployed for a short time to support the cleaning work in schools,” he said. “Private schools have suffered severe financial losses so we are expecting at least this minimal support. We cannot afford the high cost of paying workers. We have to take loans and if reopening is postponed again, our costs will increase further,” said Samuel Raj, correspondent, Jerusalem Nursery and Primary School, Mela Panangadi. “With no maintenance work done for a long time, it is difficult to find workers. By deploying MGNREGA workers, they will also get work and it would be a service to the society as well,” said R Velmurugan, correspondent, Chakravarthi Vidhyalaya Nursery and Primary School, Usilampatti. The FePSA also sought for support from the local health department to sanitize school campuses ahead of the reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-urged-to-deploy-mgnrega-workers-to-clean-pvt-schools/articleshow/86821650.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Goa||SAFF Cup: India go from bad to worse with Sri Lanka draw||Whatever happens between now and the end of the SAFF Championship, India’s goalless draw against Sri Lanka at the National stadium in Male on Thursday will stick out like a sore thumb. After the disappointing 1-1 draw against Bangladesh in their opening round clash, India were expected to claw their way back against Sri Lanka. Instead, the seven-time champions played even poorly against the lowest-ranked team in the region. At 205, Sri Lanka are ranked almost 100 places below India. Their first two games ended in defeats against Bangladesh and Nepal. Yet, India could neither score nor trouble goalkeeper Sujan Perera. The poor show left India without a win in two games. They are placed third with two points and will need to win both their remaining games against Nepal (October 10) and Maldives (October 13) to have a chance of finishing among the top-two teams for a spot in the final. India could have been breathing easier. Igor Stimac, under pressure to accumulate more wins, chose to start without an established centre-back. The India coach opted for Rahul Bheke and Subhashish Bose as his two central defenders with Seriton Fernandes and Mandar Rao Desai on the flanks. But while that hardly caused any concern, the former champions had little or nothing to show upfront. Sunil Chhetri, who has scored more international goals than most players, was left frustrated. India had no creativity and the captain had little service. Sri Lanka did what they do best: frustrate opponents in more ways than one. Defenders Duckson Puslas and Asikumar Rahuman hastily cleared whatever came their way, and whenever there was an opportunity, the players wasted time. Little wonder there were six and eight minutes added in the two halves. India were better in the second session, thanks largely to the introduction of Yasir Mohammad. He worked the ball around, created openings, but India lacked the final touch that translates a good move into a goal. Liston missed a good chance in the opening half, while Chhetri, Anirudh Thapa and Farukh Chaudhary all went close after the change of ends. Subhashish Bose had the best opportunity, which he missed from point-blank range, in the 90th minute, while Sahal Abdul Samad’s attempt to chip the keeper in added time was poorly executed. In recent times, India have failed to edge past the likes of lowly-ranked Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Nepal. Sri Lanka is another blow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saff-cup-india-go-from-bad-to-worse-with-sri-lanka-draw/articleshow/86851071.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Tap water for all by 2023: Uttar Pradesh minister Dr Mahendra Singh||VARANASI: UP Jal Shakti minister Dr Mahendra Singh said that every household in the state would be connected with tap water supply by 2023 to ensure availability of potable water. However, a major chunk of the work would be completed by the end of this year, he added. Singh was addressing Times Water Conclave 2021, organised by The Times of India along with knowledge partner WaterAid India on Wednesday. He said that the state government is working on an accelerated pace for the implementation of schemes meant for irrigation, water supply, rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharging and strengthening of ponds, rivers and other water bodies. He said, “Making a significant move, the government recorded irrigation of 11 lakh hectares of land in 4.5 years of the Yogi Adityanath government. It has been targeted to enhance the figure to 25 lakh hectares by the end of five years, which would be a record in itself.” “For water recharging, the government has implemented Atal Bhujal Yojana,” he said, adding that the government has also enacted a law for the groundwater management under which the provision of rooftop rainwater harvesting is essential for the buildings. “It is because of the efforts of the state government that the number of blocks in dark zones (where groundwater level is critically low) has gone down from 82 to 57 in the last 4.5 years of the Yogi Adityanath government,” the minister said. He further said that 20,000 ponds were recharged in the first year, while 15,000 ponds were strengthened in the second year. “Besides, five big rivers were also undertaken for strengthening in the state. Now, work has started in 15 rivers,” he said. The minister also made an appeal to the people to create ponds in their villages in the names of their ancestors to show respect to them and contribute to environment conservation as well. “In Bundelkhand, people are coming forward to adopt ponds and we are telling them to celebrate the birthdays of their children around these ponds which will be beautified and revived,” he added. Speaking about water scarcity and contaminated ground water in different regions of the state, he said that the government is working on piped water to address the problem. Highlighting the Namami Gange programme, Singh said that it is the impact of Namagi Gange that dolphins are now visible in Ganga. “The level of dissolved oxygen has increased significantly, improving the river’s health that was also evident during the Kumbh mela,” he said, adding, “Real-time monitoring of every ghat through CCTV cameras has been started.” “UP is a diverse state and problems related to water also vary. Bundelkhand is water deficient but Gorakhpur gets deluged. Ballia has arsenic in water and Unnao has fluoride. Agra has hard water while some other regions may have their own unique problems. We are working to address all the problems,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-household-to-get-tapwater-supply-by-2023-singh/articleshow/86821686.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Water is ‘Shakti’, it’s conservation is important’||With RE Varanasi: “Water itself is ‘shakti’ (power) and that’s why its conservation is important. For this purpose, the ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism, culture and religious affairs Dr Neelkanth Tiwari while addressing a conclave on ‘Making Uttar Pradesh Water Positive’, organised by The Times of India in association with the UP Government in Varanasi on Wednesday. Addressing the inaugural function, Tiwari said, “The ambitious Namami Gange programme has been undertaken for the conservation of rivers and water resources. Besides, a number of projects have been initiated for water conservation through revitalization of ponds and water bodies. The work of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) has also been linked with water conservation.” “Before 2014, the increasing pollution in the Ganga river in Varanasi, Prayagraj and Kanpur had been a serious issue of concern. But, after the Namami Gange initiative, the situation has improved significantly and the Ganga has become clean at these places,” said Tiwari. The matter of sustainable development has been discussed at different forums, but for the first time it was debated in the legislative assembly, he said, adding that today work is on for sustainable development. Tiwari said that in Kashi only, about 20 drains were falling into the Ganga and the sewage treatment plants (STPs) were not functioning properly before 2014. “Today, the three new STPs are fully functional in Varanasi,” he said and added that similar initiatives have been undertaken in Kanpur for the treatment of wastewater. “Furthermore, the ministry of tourism is working on ecological balance through initiatives like the Ganga tourism circuit,” he said and added that wastage of water should be prevented. Speaking on the occasion, minister of state for Jal Shakti and flood control Dinesh Khatik said that water is essential for life on Earth. Highlighting the importance of water conservation approach, he said that only 15-20% water is sufficient for irrigation of cane crop through drip irrigation. “There is a need for sincere efforts to end water scarcity in future,” he added. Earlier, Venkatesh Dutta from the School of Earth Sciences, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, gave an insight of the conclave through a powerpoint presentation. Under Make India Water Positive initiative, a number of activities have been launched to create awareness about water conservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/water-is-shakti-its-conservation-is-important/articleshow/86821691.cms||---

During a hearing of a case relating to appointments for the post of police sub-inspectors, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati made it clear that for the legal fraternity in India, the mandatory language is only English and the court does not know any other language. The proceedings were with regard to the scoring of marks in English and Gujarati languages in examinations conducted for recruitment of PSIs. The candidates had scored less marks in English and performed better in Gujarati. The lawyer argued that in Gujarat people are more conversant with Gujarati and even law books are available in Gujarati. The judges immediately posed a question, “How will they read the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code? We don’t understand Gujarati.” The lawyer argued further that even law books referred to in lower courts are in the Gujarati language and Gujarat’s law journals also provide headnotes of judgments in Gujarati. This led the judges to comment, “When it comes to the law, it has to be English and only English, and nothing else. You are sending a wrong signal to the legal fraternity. Any lawyer, any upcoming, budding lawyer who wants to practice without English is nothing in this fraternity. How will he understand the judgements delivered by the Supreme Court and various high courts? Will he bank upon the translations undertaken by law journals?” The lawyer argued on the prevalence of Gujarati in the lower courts and said, “But this is the hard reality.” The judges asserted again, “Whatever the reality may be. The language has to be English.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/language-of-law-has-to-be-english-only/articleshow/86820042.cms||---

The delegation comprising high commission’s second secretary (political), Jack Taylor, economic secretary Allan Poon and political research officer Vandana Seth had a breakfast meeting with Husain and discussed the Ayodhya mosque project and status of Muslims in the changing political scenario. Talking to TOI, Husain said, “To a query on the socio-economic condition of Muslims, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, I told them the community’s perception was similar to that of other communities, which is marked by the politics of identity, governance and struggle for a greater share in development.” Muslims believe in the rule of law and have firm faith in the Constitution and its inherent guarantees to citizens, irrespective of caste, religion and class. “And this can be attributed to the overwhelming acceptance of the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict,” he added. The Australian delegation showed keen interest in the Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation's Ayodhya mosque project and the members were briefed about the mosque-hospital project, which would also house a research centre and community kitchen dedicated to freedom fighter Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi "On the political situation in UP, I pointed out that Samajwadi Party under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav was the main challenger to Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh and Akhilesh with of his track record of governance was focusing on development and social justice and trying to keep the communal discourse out of electoral politics. There are some issues related to delivery of justice to marginalised sections, including Muslims, Dalits, tribals and women, but with progress of democracy these would be overcome,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/australian-high-commission-delegation-meets-iicf-secy-discusses-ayodhya-mosque-project-muslim-issues/articleshow/86821720.cms||---

I had to book fresh tickets for the trip from Mumbai, which cost me Rs37,500 as against the earlier cost of Rs18,000. I cannot cancel the trip, as I have paid a non-refundable hotel tariff in advance,” Jog told TOI. Like Jog, several other flyers have been forced to redraw their travel plan, incur fresh and higher expenses to go ahead with the plan and wonder why there could not have been a more advance notice about the precise closure dates. The airport would remain closed for all flight operations till 29 to facilitate the runway re-carpeting work. Travel agents are in a fix, as the closure comes at a time when the festive season has started to peak. “A client, who was to go to Srinagar on October 17, had booked his tickets a month ago for Rs5,500. Now, he has to pay Rs25,000 for the same from Mumbai. Another client, who was to go to Coorg on October 18, cancelled his trip. We will face heavy losses,” Nilesh Bhansali, director of the Travel Agents Association of Pune, told TOI. Flyers who have booked flight tickets from travel websites are hassled even more. “I can’t get through to their call centre executives. Last evening, I was on hold for 45 minutes. My emails and tweets were not replied,” said Sameer Doshi, who had a flight booked for Kolkata on October 19. A GoFirst spokesperson said, “Passengers can advance or postpone the journey with an applicable difference in the fare. Also, they can claim a refund if they wish not to travel. In case the passenger wants to re-route his travel or for a sector change, it can be done by paying the difference in the fare.” An IndiGo spokesperson said that flyers could either cancel and get a full refund or go to their website and clock on ‘Plan-B. Airlines such as SpiceJet and AirAsia didn’t reply to TOI’s queries until the filing of this report. Representative of another airline said, “The decision has come quite suddenly and it’s a shock for us but we have to comply. Hopefully, the IAF can be convinced to hold it until the festive season is over.” Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said no formal request for such an arrangement had come to him from any airline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/forced-to-replan-trips-flyers-miffed-over-airport-closure/articleshow/86819988.cms||Joy Sengupta

These include personal secretaries, assistants, and other staff in these offices. Persons — mostly party workers and loyalists of the CM and ministers — have been working in their respective positions only on verbal instructions. The general administration department is yet to issue any formal orders on these appointments of various staff members in the CMO and offices of ministers. According to sources, this has led to a governance problem as official communications between various departments are made through PAs and PS, and there is no formal order of appointment of these persons yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/appointment-of-ministerial-staff-pending/articleshow/86820082.cms||Kapil Dave

The minister has refuted allegations that his son Ashish was responsible for the farmers’ deaths. But two cars from the convoy that day have been “linked” to the minister — one belongs to him and another to his son’s “friend”.

Tikait posted a tweet saying, "The government should immediately arrest the culprits of the Lakhimpur massacre."“The minister has confirmed that the (Thar) jeep was registered in his name and that he had let the driver take it for some work. The other car, a Fortuner, was registered in one Ankit Das’s name. We have found Ankit is a resident of Lucknow and the nephew of a former MP. He will definitely be questioned by the police,” a senior police official who didn’t want to be named told TOI. Lakhimpur Kheri case live updatesImages from Das’s social media profiles were shared widely on Wednesday, in which he is seen sharing the stage with BJP members, including Teni, at various events. Those in Lakhimpur Kheri identified him as Ashish’s friend. “Ankit bhaiya comes to meet Ashish bhaiya quite often. They are good friends but I don’t know if he came to Banbirpur on October 3,” a local trader who is involved in BJP’s work in Lakhimpur Kheri told TOI. A farmer who was present at the site of the Banbirpur killings on Sunday added, “One of the persons (from the convoy) we handed over to the police had told us that the Fortuner belongs to a Lucknow-based contractor. The man himself said he was a clerical officer for the contractor. Later, we realised it’s Ankit Das’s car.” Read AlsoLakhimpur violence: Farmers' kin dispute autopsy, agree to cremate three after mediationFor hours on Tuesday, families of farmers who died in Sunday’s violence at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri refused to cremate the bodies after the autopsy reports "did not mention bullet injuries". Over the day, with BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait stepping in and holding talks with the administration,Earlier in the day, Teni met Shah “after the state government submitted its report on the Kheri violence to the home department”, BJP sources told TOI. Teni had, however, denied any link between the Lakhimpur Kheri case, in which his son is an accused, and Wednesday’s meeting, telling a news agency that the reason for his Delhi visit is that he has “work and appointments” lined up. Teni is scheduled to be the chief guest of an event on prison reforms, organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, on Thursday at Mahipalpur in Delhi. While there was speculation that Teni may step down, BJP sources told TOI on Wednesday evening that it may not be on the cards. Bhartiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who has been at the forefront of the negotiations of farmers from Kheri with the administration, had demanded Teni’s resignation. There were also reports that Ashish may surrender to the police, but he had not done so at the time of filing this report. Photos: Protests across country over Lakhimpur Kheri violenceMeanwhile, BJP MLA Romi Sahni, who represents Palia in Lakhimpur Kheri, came out in strong support of farmers. “Many farmers who had gathered in Banbirpur village to stage a protest against the deputy CM (Keshav Prasad Maurya) and the Union minister (Ajay Mishra Teni) were from Palia, which is dominated by members of the Sikh community. Efforts have been made to defame Sikh farmers, but they have been the country’s pride,” he told TOI. “They have transformed UP’s economy and agriculture structure by turning barren fields into fertile farms. They made this region the state’s rice bowl … They should not be dragged into controversies because they have been true farmers.” About Sunday’s violence, he added, “I feel for every person who died that day.

---||Pune||Task force draws clues from second wave to prioritize vax for adolescents||Pune: State paediatric Covid task force experts are putting their heads together to identify the predominant underlying medical conditions associated with severe coronavirus illness among kids during the second wave of the pandemic. The exercise, one of the experts said, would help the Maharashtra government prioritize Covid vaccination among the high-risk adolescents in the state ahead of the nationwide rollout of ZyCov-D. The three-dose needle-free ZyCoV-D, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the country’s first vaccine that has received emergency use authorization for being administered to children aged 12 years and above. Adolescents over the age of 12 with underlying medical conditions are going to be vaccinated first, while the healthy children are unlikely to get jabs this year. The Centre is likely to issue guidelines on vaccinating children with medical conditions next week. “In addition to the Centre’s guidelines on vaccinating the high-risk adolescents, we are forming our own by studying the data of the children who developed serious Covid illness during the second wave. We will analyze the risk factors that made them vulnerable. The homegrown analysis will lend deeper insights while prioritizing Covid vaccination among the high-risk adolescents,” said senior paediatrician and task force member Pramod Jog. Among children with Covid diagnosis, what underlying medical conditions are common and which are associated with severe coronavirus illness are primarily the questions the task force members are finding the answers to. “Overall, we know that some of the comorbid conditions, such as asthma, obesity and neuro-development disorders, were the most common. Our aim is to analyze the finer details about the risk factors that were predominantly observed linked with severe Covid illness among children in Maharashtra during the second wave,” Jog said. Senior paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, chief trial investigator of ZyCoV-D vaccine among adolescents at D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital in Pune, said, “The task force’s findings will expand the knowledge available regarding the risk factors that differentiate children with severe Covid-19 and help prioritize Covid vaccination among the high-risk adolescents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-draws-clues-from-second-wave-to-prioritize-vax-for-adolescents/articleshow/86819991.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The MVA won 46 seats, more than twice the BJP’s tally of 22, though the latter was the single largest party. The BJP had a setback in its bastion, Nagpur which is home to Union minister Nitin Gadkari and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, where it lost a seat while the Congress won the highest number of seats. In 144 panchayat samitis that went to polls, BJP won 33 seats while MVA won 77 . Congress emerged the single largest party with 36 seats. When ZP and panchayat samiti results are combined, BJP and Congress have won the same number: 55 seats. In the ZP polls, Congress won 19 seats, three less than BJP. NCP won 14 while Shiv Sena had 12. Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi won 6 seats in Akola. The bypolls were necessitated after the Supreme Court quashed the OBC quota in local body polls and cancelled elections of candidates who had won from the quota. The bypolls were held in the districts of Nagpur, Dhule, Nandurbar, Palghar, Washim and Akola. “BJP has emerged as the single largest party. It has won 25% of the 229 seats,” said BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis. The MVA, which is made up of three parties had to be content with 50% of the seats. And Shiv Sena, which is part of the government, is in the last position,” he added. However, according to the ruling coalition, MVA constituents gained since the last poll. “The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have improved their tally since the last ZP polls. BJP had 31 of the ZP seats and its tally has dropped. It tried to mislead voters on the OBC and Maratha issue but this was rejected by voters,” said PWD minister Ashok Chavan.. In Nagpur, home-ground of Fadnavis, BJP lost a ZP seat while Congress gained two. An aggressive campaign by animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar helped Congress. NCP lost two seats. Analysts say this could be because former home minister Anil Deshmukh who is under an ED cloud, was missing from the campaign trail. Responding to the BJP’s setback in Nagpur, Fadnavis said, “We lost one seat in the ZP but gained 4 seats in the panchayat samiti. This means that the space for the BJP is growing and that of the MVA is shrinking.” In the Palghar ZP polls, BJP’s bid to forge an alliance with the MNS did not yield results, with Shiv Sena winning more seats than other parties. However, Sena MP Rajendra Gavit’s son lost his seat, one of the big upsets. In Akola, which has a large dalit vote base, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi won six seats, BJP lost seats in Nandurbar and Dhule.

---||Hyderabad||Merger with GHMC must to revive SCB’s health||At the onset, I must underline that it is imperative to take an unbiased perspective while engaging in a discussion around the merger of Secunderabad Cantonment Board areas with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). Having said that, a cursory glance at the GHMC map shared here is enough to ascertain that the white space, surrounded by circles 14, 16, 17 and 18, represents the Cantonment area. That apart, it also shows how the Cantonment area is geographically, administratively, and logistically entwined with GHMC. Yet, when it comes to specific focus on issues such as sanitation, the advantages of scale, manpower, and technical competence weigh heavily in favour of the areas under the corporation. Our administration mechanism too is defined by geographical jurisdictions. When it comes to intent and resource allocation towards the northern areas of Hyderabad, the immediate question asked is whether the area falls within GHMC or Cantonment? For denizens driving through the city, the quality of sanitation services (or the lack of it) that exist in the Cantonment area vis-a-via those available in GHMC areas, is clearly discernible. And this includes door-to-door waste collection, segregation at source, deployment of Swachh Auto Trolleys, establishment of transfer stations and DRCC (Dry Resource Collection Centres), promoting no-bin areas, dedicated collection mechanism for commercial areas, transportation of waste, treatment and disposal, sweeping of roads and supervision In the Swachh Survekshan 2020 ratings, GHMC stood first among all mega cities whereas the Secunderabad Cantonment was first from the bottom among all cantonments of the country. Given this reality, integration of Cantonment areas into GHMC is certain to ensure comprehensive and holistic management of sanitation along with better utilisation of GHMC resources deployed in geographic areas around the Cantonment. It will open up access to GHMC’s integrated and scientific management methods and establish better sanitation practices in place. Result: Improvement in health of Cantonment residents. Therefore, I suppose, it’s time to consider a merger.

AIPSN is a network of over 40 people’s science movements spread across the country. Chatterjee had recently expressed doubts about Covaxin data and had pointed out that the delays it is facing in getting emergency use nod from the World Health Organisation (WHO) is an indication of this problem. Pointing out that the Phase-3 preprint is a concise medical paper and that the entire statistical report of 750 pages had been shared with the regulator, Ella tweeted: “Before calling it ‘a serious concern’, would request you to show constraint, a thorough understanding of vaccinology, and patience. Scientists and medical professionals are in this together. We must ensure we curb vaccine hesitancy.” On Chatterjee’s concerns regarding reporting of adverse events, Ella said: “While writing a paper, an author is limited by the number of words they can use. The reporting of Adverse Events (in detail) has been shared with the regulators. Request you to do a quick literature review on the depth of reporting from other vaccines.” Ella also pointed out that Covaxin’s trial was first in reporting efficacy against Delta variant in a randomised control clinical trial. “No other vaccines have reported efficacy. The wide confidence intervals are due to interim findings. The phase 3 paper has been accepted and will be made available shortly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bbs-raches-ella-slams-aipsn-prez-over-covaxin-data/articleshow/86820355.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

However, the board currently has no such committees in place. This, even when problems such as bad roads, poor sanitation, non-functioning street lights, strays animals, water contamination among others remain prevalent in SCB areas. As per the Cantonment Act, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) must set up six committees — business regulation, civil areas, education, health & environment, finance, public works & buildings — to ensure good governance but none of them have been formed. “The 74th Constitutional Amendment or Nagarpalika Act was effected to give power to the people in urban governance. For this, committees were to be set up in all municipal corporations, including cantonment boards to ensure citizen participation and accountability. SCB officials, however, have violated this amendment,” said 67-year-old Venkata Ramana, a local. “During their six-year term, elected members have done nothing. Their efforts are invisible,” B Damodar Naidu, a resident of Rasoolpura, told TOI. S Tirupathi Reddy, a resident of Karkhana said that while proceedings used to be uploaded on the SCB portal. “Now, they are not displayed to the public in SCB circles or even the official notice boards,” he said. Residents said that while the six-year term of elected board members had been completed and dissolved in 2020, none in the previous term served as members of any major committees. “We had constituted committees, recommended them twice to Union ministry of defence (MoD) along with list of elected members, to notify them as per new Cantonment Act and modify them to give more powers. Unfortunately, previous members’ term had finished,” SCB chief executive officer, B Ajith Reddy told TOI. He claimed that civil area committees had been formed with elected members. “We had recommended giving more power to the board’s vice-chairman too,” he said. Meanwhile, former member from Ward-VI Pandu Yadav said, “We had given our names for committees but none had been announced during my six-year-tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/members-come-go-but-scb-remains-sans-spl-committees/articleshow/86819715.cms||Sunil Mungara

Elections are scheduled for February 2022. The state election commission has directed civic bodies, including the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to start the process of delimitation based on the three-ward panel system declared by the government. A notification to this effect was issued by the commission on Tuesday. “We have received the direction from the state election commission. The delimitation of civic areas according to the new guidelines of the state government and commission will start,” said Ajit Deshmukh, coordinator for the elections in the PMC. The state election commission’s data shows that the PMC will include 54 panels of three wards and one four-ward panel. Currently, the PMC has 164 wards across 42 panels. A four-ward panel system is in place currently. “The 2021 Census has not been conducted in view of the pandemic. The wards will be drafted based on the old Census. It may not reflect the increase in population over the last one decade. But since the latest authentic Census data available is of 2011, it will be used,” said a senior civic official. The PMC has become biggest civic body in Maharashtra after the inclusion of 23 villages in July. The civic limits increased to 518.77 sq km after the merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/just-2-more-pmc-wards-after-merger-of-villages/articleshow/86820036.cms||---

He was in his early 80s. According to Trivedi’s nephew, Kaustubh Trivedi, the actor had been unwell for a long time and breathed his last around 10 pm at his residence in Kandivli. “He had a lot of age-related health issues and was not keeping well. He was in the hospital earlier and had come home only recently. He died of a heart attack at his residence around 10-10.30 pm,” Kaustubh said. His last rites were held at Dahanukar Wadi cremation ground, Kandivli, on Wednesday morning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to Arvind Trivedi, describing him as an “exceptional actor” who was passionate about public service. Besides his acting career, in 1991, Trivedi was elected as a Member of Parliament from Sabarkatha constituency, representing the Bharatiya Janata Party. A host of celebrities, including his co-stars from ‘Ramayan’, also took to social media to mourn his demise. Trivedi acted in nearly 300 Hindi and Gujarati movies and found immense popularity in Ramanand Sagar’s TV series ‘Ramayan’. The actor’s other works, including TV series ‘Vikram Aur Betaal’ (1985) and the 1998 Gujarati feature film ‘Desh Re Joya Dada Pardesh Joya’ were also huge hits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/arvind-trivedi-best-known-as-raavan-in-ramayan-dies/articleshow/86822988.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: With new SOPs, school bus owners mull 30% fee hike||MUMBAI: School Bus Owners’ Association (SBOA) on Wednesday said it may hike bus fees by 30% in view of stringent SOPs issued by state transport department a day earlier. Anil Garg of SBOA said, “Every bus can now carry only 50% of total capacity, making it financially difficult to ferry children at the previous cost. We will have to hike fees by nearly 30%. We will take a representation to schools soon.” The operators said a key SOP was getting into an agreement with school authorities, for which they have faced difficulties earlier. “Schools signing agreements will have to take responsibility for children travelling in buses. While some readily sign the agreement, other schools are reluctant to own responsibility,” Garg alleged. SBOA also demanded a financial package from government, as unlike other modes of transport, school buses were shut down for one-and-a-half years, causing hardships to operators, and rendering over a lakh attendants and drivers jobless across the state. “It is high time the government offers us a financial package and waives road taxes for at least six months, as it did for private tourist buses,” Garg said, adding that operators should also receive financial aid to restart business. “As per the present SOPs, we will have to santinise buses twice daily, keep them clean, keep masks and sanitisers on board besides, taking preventive care of students travelling to school,” he said. Attendants will have to ensure social distancing in the bus. “Each student should be seated with adequate gap/distance maintained from a fellow student in the bus. Ideally, the carrying capacity should be not more than 50%,” the SOP said. It said bus windows should be kept open throughout the journey but in an AC bus, the temperature should be maintained at 24-30 degrees. Driver and attendant have to be fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-new-sops-school-bus-owners-mull-30-fee-hike/articleshow/86820067.cms||Somit Sen

Speaking at the occasion, Dr Altinor highlighted the rich history between India and Turkey. “Hyderabad has a unique cultural history, with similarities to Turkish culture and history”, he said, adding, “Besides the strong cultural cohesion between two nations, the relationship of both the Princess Esra and Princess Esin with Hyderabad has catalysed the connection with Turkey.” “The schools, colleges, institutions and centres of education built by the Nizam, including the Osmania University, are testimony to their vision for improving the education system in Hyderabad,” Dr Altinor said. Also speaking on the occasion, MJTEL trustee and Paigah family scion MA Faiz Khan said, “Prince Mukarram Jah always valued quality education and social empowerment.

Among those yet to return to campus are the children of migrant labourers. Officials in the Dakshina Kannada department of public instruction estimate that around 5% of the migrant labourers’ children were not attending classes on campus. The officials said that children of migrant workers constituted around 8% of the cumulative student strength across the district. Deputy director of public instruction, Dakshina Kannada Malleswamy said, “Some of the migrant workers have returned to the district, as have their children. Many of them continue to attend online classes. Whether they will start attending classes on campus depends on their parents.” Meanwhile, Malleswamy said that the deadline for seeking admission to schools had been extended to the end of October. “The exact number of students who have been deprived of education will be known by the end of the month. We expect that most children will return to the campus after a month,” he said. Another DPI official pointed out that, the construction sector was yet to fully recover in the district, owing to which a large section of the migrant workers were yet to return to Dakshina Kannada. “Construction is yet to resume fully. Furthermore, many workers may be hesitating to return owing to the fear of Covid-19. We expect more students on campus once we reintroduce midday meals,” he said. Deputy director (education) of the social welfare department, Dakshina Kannada Yogeesh S said that only 15% of the students were yet to return to their lodgings in the pre-matriculation hostels. “However, most hostels housing senior students are nearly full. Most students who reside in the pre-matriculation hostels are from Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Raichur and Dakshina Kannada’s neighbouring districts. Those returning to the hostels must furnish the results of an RT-PCR test, confirming they are negative for the novel coronavirus. We have set up an isolation room in all hostels where students showing symptoms of Covid-19 will be housed,” Yogeesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/children-of-migrant-workers-yet-to-return-to-campus/articleshow/86819268.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Addressing the conclave under The Times of India’s ‘Make UP a water positive state’ initiative at hotel Taj Ganges here on Wednesday, the CM said, “Water is a must for healthy nature and also human beings. Availability of clean drinking water cuts half of the expenditure on treatment of ailments. Through TWC, TOI is imparting the art of living to the masses by forwarding this initiative in a mission mode.” Further talking about the importance of clean water, the CM recalled, “After entering 38 districts of east UP in 1977, Japanese encephalitis had been claiming around 1,500 lives, mainly of children, per year. Since 1998, I have been raising the issue in and outside Parliament. However, no one paid attention to it despite the fact that the children becoming victims of JE belonged to the same castes and communities that were being exploited as vote banks by the opposition parties for decades.” “In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Clean India mission and construction of toilets in each household started,” he said adding, “After assuming the CM’s office in 2017, I ensured construction of 2.50 crore clean toilets in one and a half year,” the CM said. “I also formed an inter-departmental coordination committee to combat JE by making the health department as the nodal agency. Apart from ensuring construction of toilets, this committee initiated many other measures, including ensuring clean drinking water in these 38 districts. Now, the mortality rate due to JE has come down to 98%,” said the CM. Stating how the Namami Gange programme launched by the PM has changed the quality of water of the river Ganga, the CM said: “The world had realized how the Ganga started becoming free from pollution during the 2019 Kumbh of Prayagraj. Guests from NRI meet at Varanasi, including Mauritius premier and a 400-member delegation had visited Prayagraj on my request. While performing Ganga Aarti, they noticed the clean water and later they all decided to bathe in the Ganga.” “I had also taken feedback from NDRF personnel about the quality of the water in the Ganga during my recent visit to take stock of the flood scene in Varanasi. The NDRF personnel said that in the past three years, the quality of water has improved as now they do not suffer skin allergies as in the past on staying in the river water for long during rescue operations,” said Yogi. He also mentioned that the “return of the Ganges dolphins in the river is also proving how the river water quality is improving”. “After the Ganga, its tributaries are also being covered under this programme,” said Yogi, adding, “Dredging of rivers like the Saryu to improve their water channel has not only minimized the threat of floods in the state, but income through auctioning of sand has also been started.” He said that over 60 rivers have been revived by linking with public and MNREGA. “Despite the fact that massive work has been done for the rivers, there are more critical issues,” said Yogi. “In 2017, I found that of 824 development blocks in the state about 50% had become dark zones, including 300 in critical category. However, no attention was paid towards it despite the fact it was hazardous for the earth as well as water consumers,” he said while mentioning how initiatives of his government like Kashi and Chitrakoot models of ground water recharging, ban on plastic, allowing potters’ fraternity to collect clay from ponds and others helped in positively changing the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/twc-is-not-only-an-event-its-a-life-saving-campaign-says-yogi/articleshow/86821737.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

We will be taking all necessary precautions to ensure crowd management to keep Covid-19 at bay,” said KVSN Raju, a member of the Hill Country residents’ association in Nizampet. Hotels in the city too will be using the festive period as an opportunity to make up for their pandemic-induced losses by conducting Navratri special events. A star hotel in Somajiguda will be hosting a Navratri Utsav where live music, authentic food counters, live singers and a huge dandiya setup will be set up for patrons. For Bathukamma, elaborate arrangements have been made for the festival at the decades-old Katta Maisamma-Pochamma Temple at Chilkalguda in Sithapalmandi. The temple holds an equal significance to the Ujjaini Mahakali temple in Subhash Nagar. “While Bathuku means life, Amma is a compliment to women. During the festival, women dressed in sarees or Langa Voni (half saree) dance around in circles, singing songs and clapping for the Devi, seeking health and prosperity for their families,” said C Devasena, a resident of Sithapalmandi. On October 7, Atukula Bathukamma, Sapidi Pappu (boiled dal), bellam (jaggery) and Atukulu (Poha) will be offered in various places where Bathukamma celebrations are being organised. Rituals such as akhanda deeparadhana, navagraha puja, kalasa stapana, abhishekam, and sahasra namarchana were performed at various temples across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-to-see-grand-bathukamma-navratri-celebrations-this-week/articleshow/86819759.cms||---

According to data of vaccination till Tuesday, while Surat achieved over 100% coverage of the first dose, city stood fourth among municipal corporations. What the data did not reveal though is that Vadodara had the highest ratio of persons who took the second dose after taking first dose. Data reveals that 64.2% of the persons who took the first dose in the city have also taken the second dose. Other major cities are far below 60% on this front. VMC officials said that the percentage of second dose was calculated taking the persons who took the first dose as the base. They added that Vadodara did not have a large migrant population like Surat. “The target is just an estimate and not an exact number” said the official. Sources in VMC added that second dose compliance was high in Vadodara as personnel had been given the task of calling people who were due for the second jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-tops-list-of-two-doses-in-state/articleshow/86818728.cms||Sachin Sharma

Durga Utsav pandals at New Market and Bittan Market are ready to become a centre of attraction. This year, organisers at New Market are focusing on decoration as no tableaus — a major attraction in the past — are allowed. The Bittan Market pandal has been prepared at Ganj Basoda. “Since there will be no tableau this year too, we are concentrating on innovating decoration using eco-friendly bulbs. The district administration guidelines will be followed,” said Ajay Devnani, secretary of New Market Vyapari Mahasangh. “Due to restrictions, our pandal replicating the temple of Khantu Shyam in Rajasthan, will be a mojor attraction,” said president of Bittan Market Durga Utsav Samiti, Hariom Khjatik. On the eve of the Navratri, the state home department issued a fresh set of guidelines allowing garba only in colonies and mohallas with due permission from the district administration and at 50% capacity. Large-scale garba events are banned this year too. Pandals will have to be not more than 30x45 feet in size. No processions will be allowed. Usual restrictions like wearing masks, social distancing and use of santisers will have to be followed. District magistrates will ensure compliance of the guidelines under section 144 of the CrPC or using any other law for the purpose, said an order signed by additional chief secretary, home, Rajesh Rajora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-mega-garba-events-this-yr-but-navratri-spirit-remains-high/articleshow/86820035.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

At the Sassoon hospital, about 40% of the Covid patients are from Ahmednagar alone. “Almost 50% of our Covid patients are from the rural as well as the city areas of Ahmednagar, Solapur and their adjoining areas like Akluj and Pandharpur. These patients get referred to hospitals in Pune for higher treatment. We are seeing the referrals from the two districts for over one-and-a-half months now,” said Noble hospital’s infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid. The Noble hospital currently has 50 Covid patients admitted at its set up in Hadapsar. “After Ahmednagar, we have maximum patients from Solapur. A majority of these outstation patients are aged below 50 years and are unvaccinated. The flow of these patients has increased in the last few days,” Dravid said. Quite a few of these patients are also from towns surrounding Ahmednagar district, including Sangamner, Akole, and Parner, Dravid said. “These patients are being treated with remdesivir, steroids, and other supportive treatment. Critical patients are being treated with tocilizumab. There is no shortage of any medicine for now,” he said. Confirming, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “We have 62 Covid patients undergoing treatment at our hospital.

---||Delhi||No colour-coded stickers to spot polluting vehicles in Delhi yet: Road safety expert||NEW DELHI: Around 20 lakh vehicles are plying on the roads of Delhi and are polluting the air, but the initiative to install colour-coded stickers to identify such vehicles hasn’t taken off in the past two years, National Road Safety Council member Kamal Soi said on Wednesday. Every year, thousands of people die in the national capital due to causes related to pollution in the city, while 1.5 lakh people die in road accidents across the country, said Soi, who is also the President of Rahat-The Safe Community Foundation and an adviser to Transport Research Laboratory, UK. The approaching winter will affect pollution adversely in Delhi and colour-coded stickers are a must to identify the oldest vehicles using outdated technologies and emitting the highest amounts of pollutants, he emphasised. Out of Delhi’s 1.5 crore vehicles, 70% are two-wheelers and, besides this, around 20 lakh vehicles are 10-15 years old, but still running, he claimed. He further said the pollution from factories didn’t contain PM 2 and remained in the same area, while PM2 from vehicles spread throughout the city. Soi alleged that for the past two years, the work for colour-coded stickers had come to a halt. He claimed that Delhiites got more sick from Covid-19 because PM2 coming out of vehicles was too much here. PM2 goes through the breath to the lungs and the person becomes ill soon, he pointed out. “The Delhi government had talked about installing colour-coded stickers to identify Euro-IV vehicles before 2019, but for the past two years, this sticker is not being installed on old vehicles. Due to this, there is pollution running on the roads. The vehicles involved are not being identified,” Soi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-colour-coded-stickers-to-spot-polluting-vehicles-yet-road-safety-expert/articleshow/86820324.cms||---

They also alleged involvement of a private builder in the demolition work. “The bridge is important for residents residing at the disputedslum pocket. Its demolition will affect easy access to main roads,” said Kishor Kamble, a local resident. The residents have approached the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to stop the razing down of the pathway. “The property belongs to the municipal corporation. A private builder will have to follow norms, before carrying out any activity on the land. Even then, the demolition is happening. So, we are opposing it,” said Anant Gharat, a local resident. V G Kulkarni, head of the PMC’s road department, said the civic administration would look into the matter. “The civic body has not carried out the action. We will take appropriate action in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/opposition-to-demolition-of-bridge-over-ambil-odha/articleshow/86820075.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

A second autopsy was conducted on his body late night on Tuesday and the report, which only came in after the body was cremated, said what the first one had — that he died of several antemortem injuries but not bullet injuries as the family had said. “Our father, uncle and I were present for the autopsy. It was done before us. We cremated Gurwinder at 7.30am this morning,” his brother Gursevak told TOIin the afternoon. Three doctors from Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences conducted the second autopsy well into midnight. By Wednesday evening, Gurwinder’s family had received the second autopsy report. “It still doesn’t mention bullet injuries. We are not satisfied but we have no choice. We have to accept it,” Gursevak said. On Tuesday, families of the farmers who died had refused to cremate the bodies until there was clarity over the findings of the autopsy report. The first report had attributed the deaths of all four farmers to various antemortem injuries, indicating they died in an accident, and did not mention bullet injuries. After Bhartiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait met the families and held discussions with the police on behalf of the families on Tuesday, the administration agreed to a second autopsy for Gurwinder. The three other farmers — Lovepreet Singh, 20, Nachattar Singh, 60, and Daljeet Singh, 35 — were cremated on Tuesday. Gurwinder would have turned 20 the following month. “He dropped out after Class X. He was very religious and wanted to help the poor,” said Gursevak, who has given up on his plan to go to Poland for his studies so he can support the family. “With the money we get as compensation, we will do what he wanted to — help the needy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4th-farmer-whose-family-had-disputed-autopsy-report-laid-to-rest/articleshow/86818943.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

With the beginning of Durga Puja, the 158-year-old institution celebrated the arrival of Goddess Durga with a Mahishasura Mardini Strotam night, with key performers of 'Kuhor group' from Kolkata. The entire temple premise was lit up with a number of devotees waiting in earnest to listen and participate in the auspicious ritual. Ritika Roy, a government employee, was excited as she visited the Mahalaya day celebration for the first time in Kali Bari. “The Mahishasur Mardini programme left me spellbound. I had goosebumps while the singers sang in such a melodious manner,” said Roy. Another devotee, Dheeraj Sonkar, a manager in a private firm said, “To me, Goddess Durga feels like my mother and her eternal love brings me here every single day.” Sonali Ghosh Chakraborty, founder of the musical group, said, “Kuhor means ‘Koel’ and as the group is known for its melodious music nights. We are a group of 10 singers who have been singing for about 15 years.” Gautam Bhattacharya, president, managing committee of the temple, said that though the temple faced financial crunch due to the pandemic, still with the support of devotees and other members, we were able to celebrate the arrival of Devi to the fullest. “We have made proper arrangements.

---||India||US deputy secy: On same page with India on Afghanistan, mindful of its concerns||NEW DELHI: Signalling a strong convergence on China and a preparedness to keep Indian concerns over Afghanistan in mind, US deputy secretary Wendy Sherman said Taliban needs to provide an inclusive government while Beijing should follow global rules. In a sign that the US has taken on board India’s security concerns after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and giving a hint of the next steps US may take in the war-ravaged country, Sherman said here on Wednesday, “We will always have India’s security front and centre in our considerations of how the US proceeds.” In one of the clearest enunciations of US policy towards China, she said the US would compete, challenge and cooperate with China in various fields. “We have a very complex relationship with China. And it falls into three pathways. One is, we know that China will be a major competitor with the US in economics, emerging tech and in future. We’re happy to compete with China, as long as there is a level playing field... Let’s make sure that everybody’s living by the rules of the road.” Sherman held discussions with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and also called on NSA Ajit Doval. She also called on foreign minister S Jaishankar. Later, she told journalists that Taliban “must create an inclusive government, ensure that Afghanistan not be a safe haven for terrorists, allow safe travel of people who wish to relocate and subscribe to human rights, including rights of women, girls and minorities.” She said the US and India were “on the same page” regarding Afghanistan and the demand for unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance. “We must help the Afghan people that they are suffering terribly. We don’t believe that now is the time to provide money directly to Taliban or to the interim government. The US issued a general license from our treasury department, so that any country providing humanitarian assistance wouldn’t be sanctioned by US government,” she said. “The President believed... after 20 years, we needed to step aside and make sure that we took our resources and use them in different ways in terms of our military. But he didn’t in any way withdraw from our interest in the security of this region, in the security of India, and of making sure that terrorism does not grow in any part of the world,” she added. On the possibility of CAATSA sanctions on India when it takes delivery of the S-400 missile system from Russia this year, Sherman said, “We’ve been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest.” Government sources said India has shared with Sherman its own perspectives on both Afghanistan and CAATSA. India and the US, with their eyes fixed on the situation in Afghanistan, are continuing their intensive interactions. A counter-terrorism joint working group will be meeting between October 26-28, while a defence policy forum will be held this weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-deputy-secy-on-same-page-with-india-on-afghanistan-mindful-of-its-concerns/articleshow/86826100.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The estimated expenditure of the project would be around Rs3,380 crore. Around 7,300 warehouses, 2,100 cold storages and over 100 markets would be developed under the scheme. Panchayat and rural development minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia said that MP will be the first state in the country to implement the Sathi project. “It will prove effective in fulfilling the government’s goal of doubling the income of farmers and realise the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan of a self-reliant India and a self-reliant MP”, he said. Sisodia said the scheme should be given a practical form, so that farmers should get maximum benefits. He directed the nodal agency of the scheme, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), to prepare a detailed action plan and send it to the Union government to get funding. Initially, the scheme will be implemented as a pilot project in 10 development blocks of five districts . Sisodia took a meeting related to the Sathi project at the Mantralaya here on Monday.

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Erratic rains lead to rise in onion prices||NAVI MUMBAI: Onion prices have spiked by Rs 10-12 per kg in the Mumbai APMC at Vashi for over the last one week. The increased prices have been attributed to the erratic monsoon that caused a delay in the harvest of the fresh crop and caused significant damages to the old stock of the bulb. Market observers opined that the prices of this kitchen staple are expected to remain high during the festival season. The prices have climbed to Rs 28-32 per kg from the earlier Rs 18-20 a kg at wholesale markets. This has pushed the retail prices to Rs 40-45 per kg from Rs 30-35 a kg. Traders said that the volume of sale has dropped marginally due to damages in old stock, which was affected by the cyclone. Besides, retailers pick the best quality and leave the inferior ones unsold for days. The pile up has caused more damages, said a wholesaler. Prices are expected to cross Rs 35 per kg in the next few days before witnessing a dip in prices post Diwali with the arrival of new onions, said a wholesaler.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-erratic-rains-lead-to-rise-in-onion-prices/articleshow/86820099.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Relief for man jailed for raping minor wife||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has quashed a special Pocso court’s order convicting a man to 10-year in jail on charges of raping his minor wife and observed that if the high court would not interfere, the woman would lose the support of her husband and their two children lose the shelter of their father, and it would not be in furtherance of justice. While acquitting the man from the rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, Justice Paresh Upadhyay said that looking at the peculiar facts of the case, this case can be termed as an offence under the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act. The court said that the breach of this law is very common among the lower strata of society. The case is from Mangrol in Junagadh district. The couple eloped in May 2018 and an FIR under rape and Pocso charges was registered against the man, who was arrested in January 2019 and put on the trial. In July 2021, he was held guilty of rape and punished with 10-year imprisonment. While punishing him, the special Pocso court in Junagadh said that since the man and the so-called victim were living together as man and wife, she was not entitled to any compensation and the government should take it back, if any amount was given to her. Justice Upadhyay based his order to acquit the man on the trial court’s observation that the man and victim had been living as man and wife and had two kids. The HC said, “It is under these circumstances, this court finds that the conviction recorded by the sessions court needs to be set aside.” The high court cited the woman’s statement with a remark that legal requirement warrants that it be called “evidence of the victim”, but she clearly said that she had walked out of her home with the man because of her wish and gave birth to two children.

---||Mumbai||7 years later, Bombay HC begins death confirmation hearing||MUMBAI: Over seven years after a trial court here sentenced three men, including an 18-year-old to death by hanging, in the 2013 Shakti Mills gang rape case, Bombay high court began hearing the death confirmation reference and a plea against the trial court verdict. A death sentence by a trial court must be confirmed by HC to be effective. A 22-year-old photo-journalist had complained of gang-rape in August 2013, at the defunct mill compound by five persons, including a minor. A 19-year-old telephone operator too registered a crime, alleging gang rape at the same compound. The accused were mostly the same. On March 20, 2014, the sessions judge held three common accused guilty for the gang rape of the telephone operator. Minutes later they were pronounced guilty for the photojournalist’s gang rape. The death sentence was given to the trio in April 2014 by the trial court incorrectly by wrong application of law, said Yug Chaudhry, counsel for Vijay Jadhav and others, who began submissions before a bench of Justices S S Jadhav and P K Chavan on Wednesday. Section 376 E of IPC, which provides for death penalty to ‘repeat offenders’, cannot be invoked when two crimes have occurred but tried simultaneously. The provision is meant when the second offence is after conviction for the first, said Chaudhry, assisted by advocate Payoshi Roy. Section 376 E of IPC provides that a person convicted once again for an offence of rape, or gang rape, or rape where a woman is injured enough to result in her death, or in rendering her to a persistent vegetative state, shall be punished with death sentence or imprisonment for rest of his natural life. The section was brought in under the 2013 criminal law amendment. Special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi said it was a question of interpretation of law, which he would argue after Chaudhry’s submissions. Chaudhry argued that the trial was conducted in a way that did not provide fair or adequate opportunity to the defence to make submissions on framing of charge under section 376E, IPC and on quantum of sentence, after conviction. The trio had challenged the constitutional validity of law under which they were sentenced to death as ‘repeat offenders’. In January 2019, an HC bench directed that the challenge to constitutional validity be heard “along with confirmation case’’.

Sources at the Tikunia police station, where two FIRs have been lodged on Sunday’s killings, said four suspects have been detained. “They are being questioned,” the source added. The source did not, however, say which FIR the suspects have been rounded up for or the reason they were picked up. A local intelligence officer told TOI, “The priority is to ensure law and order first. The investigation is taking some time.” It was why, police said, no arrest was made four days since the violence. “We are verifying videos to make sure they’re not doctored, recording statements of cops on duty there that day and gathering evidence. Arrests will be made after we have sufficient proof. In one FIR (the one filed by a member of the minister’s convoy), no one has been named. So, we need to determine who may be the accused,” ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI. Kheri SP Vijay Dhull said the same: “We will only make an arrest after verifying the evidence that we have. Questioning is on. Both parties are levelling allegations against each other, so we have to corroborate all the proof that we have.” In the first FIR, registered at 2.53am on Monday, Ashish Mishra and “15-20 unidentified people” were booked for murder, causing death by negligence, rioting, rioting with deadly weapon, unlawful assembly, rash driving, causing grievous hurt and criminal conspiracy. It was based on a complaint by farmers, who wrote, “This (the killings) was a premeditated conspiracy by the minister and his son.” ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar had told TOI that the minister’s name is part of the FIR as well. The second FIR, lodged at 4.46am on Monday, named “unidentified” accused on charges of murder, act endangering life or personal safety of others, voluntarily causing hurt and rioting. It was based on a complaint by one of the men in the minister’s convoy on Sunday. In the FIR against farmers, the complainant alleges that journalist Raman Kashyap — who was referred to as an unidentified BJP worker in the complaint and later identified — was “beaten to death” by protesting farmers. But because Raman’s father in his complaint accused Ashish and his aides of killing him, his murder is now part of the farmers’ FIR. “Kashyap’s father’s complaint is the basis of the FIR, which will be clubbed with the one filed by farmers,” Sabat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/4-days-2-firs-no-arrest-police-say-probe-taking-time-4-being-quizzed/articleshow/86818970.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Mumbai||Bombay high HC says scrap rule relaxing 2-kid mandate||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has expressed its “dissatisfaction and disapproval” of the Rule 6 under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Declaration of Small Family) Rules, 2005, which provides for relaxation in the small family (only two children) mandate for government employees and has “requested” the state government to delete the Rule 6. In a judgment on September 24, the high court bench of Justice Ravindra V Ghuge and S G Mehare also asked the state government to “make the 2005 Rules applicable uniformly to all employees of the Government, State instrumentalities, local authorities and local bodies, if the laudable object of controlling the growth of population is to be achieved.” The bench said, “We find such rule to be not only unwarranted, but harmful for the reason that on the one hand, this country is grappling with the problem of population explosion and by introducing the 2005 Rules, the State of Maharashtra has taken a progressive step to control the problem and encourage the people to have a small family of only two children. On the other hand, these rules are not made applicable to the employees of the local authorities though similar provisions are made applicable to the persons who seek election to the Gram Panchayat, Municipality and Zilla Parishad, by introducing the disqualification clause.” “In this backdrop, Rule 6 permitting the government to relax the mandate of small families would be counter-productive. So also, these rules need to be made applicable even to the employees of the local authorities like the gram panchayat,” the high court bench said. The matter arose from a petition filed by a peon from the Karetakali gram panchayat in Shevgaon taluka of Ahmednagar district, challenging a show-cause notice of December 26, 2019, asking him to explain why action should not be initiated against him for having more than two children. A woman from the gram panchayat had on July 11, 2019, sought the peon’s removal from service — in view of a government notification of March 28, 2005, that introduced the Rules of 2005 with a prospective effect — claiming he had three sons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-high-hc-says-scrap-rule-relaxing-2-kid-mandate/articleshow/86820134.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Pune||Pune: Hospitals told to update bed occupancy data on dashboard||PUNE: The district administration has directed all the city and rural hospitals to update the Covid beds’ occupancy and availability data on the dashboard, enabling it to decide on the number of health hubs to be completely dedicated to coronavirus-infected patients’ care. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI that he had directed hospitals in the rural areas to update the date on the dashboard. The same applied to the facilities in the city limits, he added. Admitting that there was a little laxity among the hospitals regarding updating the bed availability data on the dashboard, Santosh Patil, the deputy commissioner at the Pune divisional commissionerate, said they were ensuring that no Covid patient was denied hospital care. “We have enough allocated beds in various hospitals. The hospitals not seeing any Covid patients should speak to the collector if they are in rural areas and to the commissioners of the civic bodies if they are in municipal corporation areas,” he said. Currently, the dashboard does not reflect the updated data on the bed availability in private hospitals. Also, many small and medium hospitals in the city have stopped routine Covid work because of infrastructure issues. The absence of the updated data on the dashboard was confusing citizens about the hospitals giving Covid care, said a source. A Covid patient said some hospitals that had started non-Covid work were directing patients to other healthcare facilities despite having enough beds. On September 1, the state had extended the 80:20 bed reservation for Covid patients till November. Collectors and civic chiefs were given a free hand to decide on the bed allocation on 50:50 ratio, depending on the situation. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association, Pune, told TOI that considering the number of admitted Covid patients across the city, the local administration was following the 50:50 ratio for Covid patients. “Many small and medium hospitals admitting Covid patients during the first and second waves have now switched to routine non-Covid work. Many have stopped Covid admissions because of infrastructure problems,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-told-to-update-bed-occupancy-data-on-dashboard/articleshow/86820131.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Bhopal||Restore BMHRC to former glory: Digvijaya Singh writes to PM Narendra Modi||BHOPAL: Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday shot a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to restore the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) “to its former glory”. The former chief minister suggested BMHRC could be designated by the Parliament as an autonomous PG medical hospital on the lines of PGI, Chandigarh and Jipmer, Puducherry. “After the Bhopal Gas tragedy, along with compensation there was a provision that a corpus should be made with which a hospital would be constructed. A large plot of land was allocated and a good hospital was constructed,” Digvijaya said. Digvijaya said that BMHRC operated till 2010. Meanwhile, a number of private hospitals came up in Bhopal and all good doctors left. “The private hospitals paid better salaries and appointed these doctors. Today, despite having a good infrastructure, treatment in BMHRC is not as good. And there are still many gas victims who have pulmonary problems since their lungs were adversely affected during the 1984 gas leak tragedy,” Singh argued. In his letter to the PM, Digvijaya wrote, “It (BMHRC) was the first hospital in Bhopal to provide super-specialty services such as gastrointestinal surgery, cardiology, heart surgery and brain surgery. To begin with, there was an excellent team of doctors to treat the patients, as their terms of employment were very competitive. Once the government took over the management of the hospital in 2010, most of these doctors left the hospital as the government unilaterally changed the terms of employment.” The veteran leader also informed the PM that doctors left because there was “no protection from vested interests – NGOs who interfered on a daily basis in the functioning of the hospital.” Digvijaya’s letter also stated, “The honourable Supreme Court had taken cognisance of the situation, and in 2012, had ordered that all vacancies of doctors should be filled, and such conditions should be provided that the doctors are not compelled to resign from BMHRC. In spite of this, it is seen that there are a number of vacancies of specialists and super-specialists. Because of this, many patients are unable to get treatment at the BMHRC.”  Digvijaya said that once the hospital is autonomous, renowned doctors can be brought with attractive salaries . “That is why, I urged the PM to discuss the issue with the Union health minister. A bill should be brought in the next parliamentary session, so that Bhopal can emerge as a good medical treatment centre,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/restore-bmhrc-to-former-glory-diggy-writes-to-modi/articleshow/86820116.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Fire drill finds prayers could be your only option at Nehru Place||NEW DELHI: Nehru Place is a veritable fire zone and emergency vehicles like fire tenders and ambulances do not have access to the inner courts of the sprawling commercial complex. This was established during a mock drill ordered by Delhi High Court and conducted on September 21. In its report sent to the high court and Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Fire Service said the hundreds of shopkeepers, vendors and big businesses were at deadly risk because even rescue vehicles such as those with hydraulic platforms were, at best, able to access only the outer portions of the market. The fire service recommended urgent measures like a ban on roadside parking and freeing the market of hawkers. It also wanted a ramp constructed for emergency vehicles to reach the inner areas of Nehru Place. On September 21, a distress call was made to the fire control room and tenders sent to the south Delhi market even as police, CATS ambulances and power utility staff were also alerted. However, the fire officer in charge of Nehru Place reported that fire tenders could only drive up to the police booth, around 90 metres away from the designated incidence spot. The officer, therefore, directed the crew to join hoses to be able to reach the target. Drivers of two CATS ambulances summoned to the fire site similarly expressed their inability to reach the location due to heavy traffic and roadside parking, the fire department noted in its report. DFS added that the time taken to reach Nehru Place by various agencies was also very high, indicating “significant hindrances” on the way. The first fire tender took 11 minutes to arrive from the nearby Nehru Place fire station. In response to the DFS findings, DDA claimed that a 6-metre motorable road existed around all buildings in the area. It added that the south corporation and police have been asked to free this pathway of all encroachments and cars illegally parked there. DDA said in its status report to the high court that there were two entry ramps near Satyam Cinema and another building that could help fire engines and emergency vehicles to reach the upper plaza of the commercial complex. Pointing out that the basements at Nehru Place were being misused for commercial activities instead of storage as per norms and also that there was no fire safety arrangements had been made for such establishments, DDA assured the court of constructing a new ramp from the upper to the lower plaza near buildings 27 and 97 in the complex. As for making the market a hawker-free zone, DDA reported to the court that SDMC has informed it that only after a new Town Vending Committee was formed could a decision in this regard be taken. A bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla ordered a fire drill at Nehru Place to identify obstacles faced by the fire service and the risks posed by fire to people and businesses while hearing a PIL it filed following a building fire in the District Commercial Centre on August 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fire-drill-finds-prayers-could-be-your-only-option-at-nehru-place/articleshow/86820186.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Delhi||Covid-19: 423 from UK sent to 10-day home quarantine in Delhi in 3 days||NEW DELHI: Over 400 UK nationals who have arrived in Delhi since Monday have been sent for mandatory home quarantine. Sources said that even transit passengers from the UK who were going to other states had to give their sample for an RT-PCR test at the Delhi airport. No passenger has tested positive for Covid-19 yet. The central government has decided to impose the “reciprocal” quarantine conditions on the British nationals after the United Kingdom refused to reconsider its decision to treat fully-vaccinated Indians as unvaccinated. The new regulation was issued on October 4 by the Union health ministry, which are applicable to all UK nationals arriving in India, regardless of their vaccination status. The new regulation includes a pre-departure Covid-19 RT-PCR test within 72 hours before travel, Covid-19 RT-PCR test on arrival at the airport and another RT-PCR test on Day 8 after the arrival and mandatory quarantine at home or in the destination address for 10 days after arriving in India. Prior to the new regulation, the British nationals had to undergo extra screening upon arrival due to the UK’s own surge in December. This included seven days in home quarantine and an RT-PCR test at the airport on arrival. A total of 423 United Kingdom nationals have arrived in Delhi in 10 different flights since the new regulation came into effect, including 56 in one flight at the time of going to the press. The passengers have to give a self-affidavit, declaring that they will follow the guidelines dated October 4, 2021 and that they will remain in home quarantine for the next 10 days and get tested through RT-PCR on Day 8 from the day of arrival. “Such safety protocols have already been there and for all international passengers who have to get screened by taking a Covid-19 RT-PCR test and remain in home quarantine. Only those who test positive for Covid-19 have to remain in institutional quarantine,” a senior Delhi government official said. “The only difference in this new regulation for the UK nationals is that the length of home quarantine is longer and the requirement of another test after eight days,” he said. The official said that while all international passengers were screened for Covid-19, the UK nationals were being identified separately and it was ensured that they were put under surveillance separately. “Usually, passengers are asked to remain in home quarantine, but now in the case of UK nationals, the district officials at their destination are being alerted immediately and it is their responsibility to keep the passengers under a health surveillance,” he added. “Also, not only passengers destined for Delhi and getting out of the airport arrival terminal, but also samples for the RT-PCR test for transit passengers are being taken. The authorities of the state they are visiting are informed and in case the test result comes out positive, the local authorities are alerted immediately,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/423-from-uk-sent-to-10-day-home-quarantine-in-3-days/articleshow/86820214.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The officials seized 62kg of such products from the central zone, 32.5kg from the west zone, 28kg from the east zone, 5kg from the south zone and 2.5kg from the north zone. The violators were slapped a total fine of Rs 35,900. The state government had banned single-use plastic in 2019. While officials enforced the rule strictly in the beginning, the drive lost steam after the outbreak of Covid-19. Subsequently, traders began using the banned items. While some use them openly, others are more discreet. People who started carrying cloth bags to shops have stopped the practice due to rampant use of plastic bags. Searches will be conducted regularly, a health official said. “We are now focusing on single-use plastic although we have other key areas to focus on. We keep a tab on dumping of waste in public places, mosquito breeding that can cause dengue outbreak, social distancing and mask compliance, and sales of banned tobacco products, and penalise residents and establishments,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/130kg-banned-plastic-products-seized/articleshow/86820216.cms||---

---||Delhi||Gang dupes over 3k with fake sites for RTO services||NEW DELHI: A gang of crooks duped over 3,300 people by creating fake websites providing Regional Transport Office services. The cyber cell of Delhi Police has arrested the kingpin of the racket and is looking for other members of the syndicate. The accused has been identified as Kapil Tyagi. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) KPS Malhotra said that the police had received a complaint from the ministry of road transport and highways following which an investigation was initiated. “It was alleged that fake websites such as e-parivahanindia.online, www. roadmax. in and Sarathiparivahan.com were prepared,” he said. A case was registered and a team under ACP Raman Lamba was formed, including sub-inspector Sonam Joshi and SI Karamvir, to bust the racket. “Registrant details of phishing websites were obtained and bank statements of victims were analysed,” an officer said. A thorough analysis of information, documents obtained from various agencies, banks and payment gateways led to the arrest of Tyagi from his house in Ghaziabad on Monday. “By using Google Ads, phishing websites were displayed on the top when searched on Google,” the officer said.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore airport expansion: Landowners demand alternative sites||COIMBATORE: Owners of the residential land that were earmarked for acquisition at Uppilayapalayam for the city airport expansion project staged a protest at the collectorate here on Wednesday, urging the district administration to find a suitable land for them, as the compensation amount was insufficient to buy another land and construct a new house. Pointing out that there were only 110 houses on the land that was proposed for acquisition, the residential landowners said they were outnumbered by the vacant land owners and had to abide by the majority decision. They said while the district administration had agreed to their demand for an alternative land at a consultative meeting in 2017, the officials had now reneged on their word. With the state government sanctioning the compensation amount, the residential landowners said they were left in the lurch. S Chandran, a residential landowner, said a person residing in a house on four cents of land would get only around Rs 30 lakh to Rs 35 lakh as compensation. “Given the land price in the 10km radius of Uppilayapalayam, the money will be sufficient only to buy another four cents of land. There won’t be anything left to construct new houses.” He said it would cost them at least Rs 20 lakh to construct a 1,000sqft house. Another protester said in 2017 then collector had promised them land at Arasur village. He requested the district administration not to go back on their promise. “If we get land, we can use the compensation amount to build houses.” Chandran said they had explained their predicament to collector S G Sameeran, who has assured them to bring their issues to the state government’s attention. “If they pay us the compensation amount, which might happen anytime, there won’t be any delay in issuing us eviction notices. We are expecting a positive response before that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/airport-expansion-landowners-demand-alternative-sites/articleshow/86820218.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Despite relentless efforts, can’t find Param Bir Singh: CID||MUMBAI: The state CID on Wednesday submitted a report to the Justice Chandiwal Commission saying it had made relentless efforts to trace former police commissioner Param Bir Singh to serve him a bailable warrant but he could not be traced. The case was adjourned to October 18 for recording of evidence. It was the commission’s third attempt to serve a bailable warrant on Singh. Justice K U Chandiwal is probing into the letter written by Singh to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had set the police a target of mobilising Rs 100 crore for him. As per the CID report, a team of police personnel visited the last known place of Singh. The report shows that the team had enquired with the doctor from whom Singh received treatment on particular dates. It visited the places where it was heard that he was staying. “The team made relentless efforts, but failed to trace Parambir Singh, as a result, the bailable warrant could not be served,” the CID report said. Deshmukh’s lawyer and his private secretary Sanjeev Palande’s lawyer urged the commission to issue a non-bailable warrant against Singh and attach his properties. “Provisions of law should be placed in letter and spirit to attach Parambir Singh’s properties, since he is avoiding appearance before the commission,” Deshmukh’s lawyer said. Deshmukh and Palande’s applications have been kept in abeyance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/despite-relentless-efforts-cant-find-param-bir-in-mumbai-cid/articleshow/86820230.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Delhi||AUD admissions under first cutoff begin, many keep DU option open||NEW DELHI: Admissions under the first cutoff list at Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) began on Wednesday with aspirants visiting the campus for physical verification. Along with the cutoff list, the varsity had also released a provisional list of candidates who were clearing the cutoffs for its various merit-based undergraduate courses. With AUD’s cutoff being marginally lower than that of DU, several students said that they were taking admissions at AUD as they could not get into their preferred DU colleges. Anwesha Samanta, an aspirant who received 96.2% in her Class XII boards, said, “As of now, I am taking admission at AUD for BA (Honours) history. I had applied for a bunch of courses to DU as well but I did not clear the first cutoff list. Though I am taking admission at AUD, I will still wait for DU’s second cutoff list and will take a transfer if required.” With 88% marks in his Class XII exams, Krishnanshu, another aspirant, said that he would also wait for the DU’s next list. “I had applied for BA (H) history and a few other subjects in DU. However, I did not make the cut in the first list. As I am clearing the AUD cutoffs, I am going ahead with my admission here. Will take a call about Delhi University after the second list is out,” Krishnanshu said. However, several others said that unique courses like BA(H) global studies and BA (H) law & politics offered by AUD were their first choice for admission. Aryan, an aspirant who visited the campus on the first day of admissions, said, “I wanted BA (prog) in DU but the cutoffs were quite high. Moreover, I was interested in the law and politics course offered by AUD. So I will be taking admission here itself.” For Lavanya, who has 91% in her Class XII boards, faculty in a particular department was more important. “I was clearing the cutoff at Sri Venkateswara College and Maitreyi College among others but I wanted AUD because faculty matters at the end of the day. Now, I have my choice of course and university both,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aud-admissions-under-first-cutoff-begin-many-keep-du-option-open/articleshow/86820236.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Delhi||Trust, not force, will make people follow rules, says author||Mentioning that pandemic control measures had become more law enforcing than public health in many countries, Jonathan D Quick, the author of “The End of Epidemics: The Looming Threat to Humanity and How to Stop It”, said this should not be the case and force should be the last resort.“Most people, when provided with correct information, form trust. When people get to know the things from the people they trust, they will follow the guidelines. But the trusted leaders should have a plan first. No vaccine is perfect, no medicine is perfect, but being transparent is more important as it will take us forward,” said Quick.Quick, who was conversing with Rema Nagarajan at Times LitFest, had written the book in 2018, much before the pandemic struck. He warned people of the looming threat, but said a lot of his warnings were let go.Highlighting what went wrong, he said there should be a universal health vision that everyone could access. “Achieving it requires two things, financing and a delivery system. Countries have achieved it in different ways with different combinations. Financing may vary, but the key thing is you have to be sure that everybody is included. What doesn’t work, and is deadly, is when you leave it to individuals to pay the entire cost. Financing can be a mix of taxes and employers,” added Quick.Asked why the US, which spends the most on health, did so badly, Quick said that money was not the only aspect to deal with a pandemic effectively. “It’s more about how and where you spend it. We need to invest in three things first — a universal health coverage programme, public health services such as water and pandemic preparedness, and medicines. The US has been spending a lot on the curative part and has underfunded the prevention for years. Spending on prevention is cheaper than spending on cure,” he added.“South Korea, Australia, Norway, Germany, all have strong universal public health programmes. They understand the importance of keeping communities safe. The governments need to be clear about what is at stake. The first step should be to vaccinate frontline workers, which will be better for every country’s economy. But that is not happening because there has been no global, unified political leadership. Leaders have to come together to protect our interests,” said the author.Quick said, most governments launched apps for public surveillance, at times at the cost of privacy. “But collective long-term welfare is more important than individual short-term freedom. Saying that, we also need to progress on technology to limit privacy threats,” he added.To watch live, visit www.timeslitfest.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trust-not-force-will-make-people-follow-rules-says-author/articleshow/86820279.cms||---
---||Mumbai||SC clears way for NCP men’s prosecution: Housing scam||NEW DELHI: Supreme Court cleared the decks for prosecution of corporation-level NCP leaders in Naldurg civic body in Maharashtra’s Osmanabad district for their alleged role in a scam relating to cheap housing for poor and backward classes, which comes two years after a Jalgaon trial court convicted two former state ministers for involvement in a similar scam. A bench of Justices L N Rao and S R Bhat dismissed petitions by those allegedly involved in the scam. They had challenged a Bombay high court decision to allow Jalgaon district administration to take investigations to their logical conclusion, including recovery of excess amount paid to the builder and launching prosecution of those responsible for irregularities. The petitions of Shaikh Ansar Ahmad Md Hussain, N S Jahagirdar, Abdul Rehman Khan, Uday Ambadas Jagdake, Nayyarpasha Ajjadali Jahagirdar, Nirmala Arvind Gaikwad and Minar Constructions, Latur, were dismissed. Two PILs were filed before HC, which claimed that under the Centre’s Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme for construction of 1.05 lakh dwelling units, in which the Centre’s share of the cost was 80% and the rest to be borne by the state, Naldurg municipal council floated a tender for construction of 1,206 units for the poor, of which 737 were meant for persons from reserved category and the rest for general category. The total cost of the project was Rs 21 crore. After irregular allotment of the project to a builder, only 302 housing units were constructed in Naldurg, of which 202 could be used and 100 were unusable. Proceedings before HC in the PILs led to verification of accounts, leading to discovery of excess payment of around Rs 2.5 crore. The appellants argued that criminal proceedings have been initiated against them even though they were not heard in public interest proceedings, and that being adverse to them the judgment was vitiated on account of non-participation. A grievance was also made out that of the dwelling units constructed by contractors, no deficiency was pointed out by the public agency (municipality) and even civil action stood precluded as the contractual liability period had lapsed. Justice Bhat said material showed irregularities of a severe nature. “The constructions, according to the reports, were sub-standard in respect of 100 such houses, so severe that the units were unusable. The main objective of providing housing to 1,206 eligible and deserving families remains unfulfilled despite expenditure of substantial amounts.” Dismissing the appeals, SC said HC’s direction to take the case to the logical conclusion did not warrant its interference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-clears-way-for-ncp-mens-prosecution-housing-scam/articleshow/86820295.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||Best-of-4: DU clears air on some subjects under Kerala board||NEW DELHI: Delhi University issued guidelines on Wednesday on certain subjects under the Kerala education board being treated at par with the similar subjects under the examination system of the Central Board of Secondary Education. Delhi University has been getting admission applications in large numbers from students who sat for the Kerala state board exams. DU has now listed the subjects that are acceptable for the calculation of the best of four aggregate required under the admission procedure. In Wednesday’s notification, the university’s admission branch said, “The paper entitled ‘accountancy with analysis of financial statement’ offered by higher secondary education, government of Kerala, is equivalent to accountancy of CBSE.” Similarly, ‘accountancy with computer accounting’ offered by the Kerala board would be deemed equivalent to ‘accountancy’ under CBSE. The notification added, “Please ignore the earlier equivalence pertaining to ‘accountancy with computer accounting’ where it was inadvertently stated that it is not equivalent to business studies of CBSE.” Delhi University also clarified that while ‘applied mathematics’ offered by CBSE could be considered equivalent to ‘mathematics’ for admission in BCom (Honours) and BCom Programme, it would not be equivalent to ‘mathematics’ for admission to BA (economics). Wednesday was the last day for students to apply for admission under the first cutoff list. On Thursday, the colleges must approve of the admissions and by Friday, the admitted students should have paid their fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/best-of-4-du-clears-air-on-some-subjects-under-kerala-board/articleshow/86820240.cms||---

---||Jaipur||BJP offers ticket to my wife, claims Bhinder||Edited (361) Jaipur: Janta Sena president and former BJP MLA Randhir Singh Bhinder has claimed that BJP offered his wife Jitendra Bhinder to contest polls from Vallabhnagar assembly segment. The move is seen as a middle path taken by the party since its leader Gulab Chand Kataria has vetoed the entry of Bhinder into the party. The saffron party surveyors had expressed that the best winning possibility is for its former MLA Bhinder who had quit the party in 2012 over differences with Kataria. He was solely responsible for the defeat of BJP candidates in the 2013 and 2018 assembly elections. Leader of Opposition Kataria is bitterly opposed to him to an extent that he had called the entry of Bhinder into the party at the cost of his exit from the BJP. “I have got a call from a senior party leader inquiring if I am supporting any candidate. I refused them of supporting any candidate and cleared my intentions that I will contest the polls myself. The next offer he made was for my wife which I said that I will have to discuss with my party workers,” said Bhinder. The former BJP leader held a discussion with his party members who were adamant that he should contest polls. “I have communicated the decision of my party to the BJP but still I will take a final call on Thursday,” said Bhinder. For the party, Bhinder’s wife is a safe bet to take on the Congress potential candidate Preeti Shaktawat. “The polls are set to be held on emotions which appear to be in favour of the sitting MLAs. Bhinder’s wife would assure that united support of BJP and the Janta Sena, the only combination which assures party’s victory in the polls,” said a party leader, who shared his calculation that if Janta Sena and BJP votes combined together in 2008, 2013 and 2018 assembly polls, it is giving one-sided defeat to the Congress. Bhinder has called upon the former chief minister Vasundhara Raje at least thrice in the past six months has given rise to the speculation that the former has the backing of the latter for the party’s candidature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-offers-ticket-to-my-wife-claims-bhinder/articleshow/86820325.cms||---

---||Delhi||'Marks jihad': DU professor stirs a row with comment on Kerala students||NEW DELHI: A social media post by Delhi University professor Rakesh Kumar Pandey has raised the hackles of students and teachers alike. In a Facebook post, Pandey, professor of physics at Kirori Mal College, alleged a “marks jihad” by the Kerala education board, forcing certain colleges to “over-admit” students in particular courses because they all had “100% marks from Kerala board”.   Speaking to TOI, Pandey, former president of RSS-affiliated National Democratic Teachers’ Front, reiterated on Wednesday that the “inexplicable flow of students” from the southern states to DU couldn’t be taken as a “normal, unintentional or a benign development”. The professor alleged, “It seems some plan has been in operation for two-three years. One can connect this with the loosening hold of those aligned to the political left on universities like Jawaharlal Nehru University. They, therefore, now want to spread to Delhi University.” He also dismissed the improbability of a link between the higher number of students from a particular state with the marking system of the state board. “Due to the pandemic, the number of students with 100% aggregates may have increased this year, but this trend was visible even earlier,” he said, adding that DU should conduct entrance examinations in order to stop students from “trying to exploit the criteria” in merit-based admissions. In a separate statement, the KMC professor declared, “Love done with the intention other than love is ‘love jihad’ and marks allocation with the intention guided by reasons other than academics is ‘marks jihad’.” Delhi University’s Students’ Federation of India was critical of the post. Akhil KM, convener, SFI, DU, said, “We condemn the post where Pandey disparages the Kerala board for the commendable work of its students and uses terms such as ‘marks jihad’.” Several teachers similarly expressed affront at the post. Rajesh Jha, former member of DU’s Executive Committee, said, “DU has a time-tested method of admissions. It is a central university and it does not matter whether the student is from Kerala or West Bengal or elsewhere. We cannot allow such discriminatory and volatile terms to be used against students. The high cutoffs reflect India’s higher education system. If there is an issue with the evaluation system, then it is up to the policymakers to see how to deal with it.” Echoing Jha, Nandita Narain, professor at St Stephens’ College, said, “Such remarks are condemnable. There is a problem with the marking system, yes, but that is there in many parts of the country, not just one state. It is unfair to allege that one particular board is giving inflated marks. Rather than biased comments, one should address aspects like investing more in education and increasing the number of colleges.” Abha Dev Habib, professor at Miranda House, too felt it was unfortunate such terms had been used. “It is important to address the problem of high marks given by all boards,” she said. “Moderation of marks should be done to make scores more acceptable and avoid long-term damages. Many boards are giving high marks these days; one cannot single out a particular state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-professor-stirs-a-row-with-comment-on-kerala-students/articleshow/86820293.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MPs & educationists suggest normalcy models for schools||MUMBAI: Members of Parliament, education experts and teachers have underlined the need to reopen schools and expressed concern over learning losses suffered by students since the pandemic. The Parliamentarians’ Group for Children (PGC) with support from the United Nation’s Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Swaniti Initiative had organised an online round-table conference to discuss the reopening of schools and various measures to be undertaken towards child-centric pandemic recovery. During this discussion, they suggested various models for schools that would help regain normalcy and recover the learning losses. Schools across Maharashtra resumed physical sessions for classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and 8 to 12 in urban areas on Monday after being shut for over a year and a half in wake of the pandemic. MP Gaurav Gogoi said in their formative years, when children require the physical presence of a school to learn and grow, even beyond the realms of a textbook, the pandemic forced them to live a life in solitude. “School closures come at the price of learning,” Gogoi said. Rajeshwari Chandrasekar, chief of the field office, UNICEF Maharashtra, said, “We must now focus on reopening the primary grades as well given that the risk of Covid to this population is the least, as stated in several Lancet reports, and as the learning loss is the highest.” MP Dr Fauzia Khan, a prominent member of PGC, said that loss of discipline among students was another issue. Many children were just physically present during online classes but did not learn. MPs Dr Vikas Mahatme, Arvind Sawant, Sanjay Jadhav, Vandana Chavan and Hemant Godse also attended the conference. Teachers from Maharashtra narrated their efforts to continue education in the absence of schools. Sagar Ramesh Sathe and Sneha Mohite from ‘Nine is Mine’ presented a charter of demands by children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mps-educationists-suggest-normalcy-models-for-schools/articleshow/86820362.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp nod for action plan banning single-use plastic||Thiruvananthapuram: Reeling from foiled attempts in the past at plastic ban, the corporation council here on Tuesday approved the action plan to introduce plastic ban in a phased manner in the city. The action plan was formulated in the wake of notification issued by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change on August 12 which specified timelines for banning plastic based on thickness. P Jameela Sreedharan, chairperson of health standing committee who presented the action plan, said the corporation’s efforts at reducing use of plastic suffered a major setback with the spread of Covid. Use of disposable items necessitated by Covid due to social distancing measures led to a significant increase in single-use plastic items in the city, she said. As per the action plan, around 80,000 food packets were disposed of in the city during Covid times. On an average, 1 lakh plastic carry bags and 1.5 lakh paper cups are used by the city residents, the action plan notes. Jameela Sreedharan said the non-biodegradable waste constitutes 35% of 400 tons of total waste being generated in the city. With the plastic ban coming into effect, the corporation plans to bring down non-biodegradable waste generation by 20%. The corporation has held meetings with representatives of merchants association, textile merchants, street vendors and merchants of Chalai and Palayam. The merchants have sought some time to dispose of their present stock before they can cooperate fully with the ban. The action plan mainly focuses on awareness programmes, mike announcements, discussions, collection drives and endorsing alternatives for plastic till January 2022. Legal action by special squads of the health wing will be initiated only from January 1, 2022. The corporation plans to ban plastic carry bags below 100 microns by June 2022 and carry bags below 120 microns by December 2022 in compliance with the direction of MoEF&CC. Failure in making available proper alternatives has always affected the corporation’s anti-plastic campaigns. The councillors who spoke regarding plastic ban also stressed the need to ensure proper alternatives. In 2017, the city corporation had sold out more than 10,000 cloth bags manufactured from its five production units in the city. The corporation which was planning an aggressive entry into the cloth bag market following a ban on all kinds of carry bags had to slow down mainly owing to difference in cost of procurement and production. The gap between purchase of raw material and production costs badly affected the corporation’s plans. In February 2017 the civic body had decided to introduce 30 lakh paper and cloth bags by the middle of 2017 as an alternative to plastic carry bags. The project, however, failed to take off. Jameela Sreedharan added that the units are being revived after maintenance of machines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-nod-for-action-plan-banning-single-use-plastic/articleshow/86792250.cms||---

Rai said, “We had run an anti-dust campaign in Delhi last year, too, and saw its impact in controlling dust pollution. Based on our experience, we have prepared a robust plan for running this campaign in an organised manner throughout Delhi. Our teams will conduct inspections at construction sites and monitor the situation.” TimesViewAn anti-dust campaign was much-needed. This is a well-intentioned move. However, the truth is that both private and government owned construction projects violate the rules. Government should treat them equally and fine all errant sites. By walking the talk, it will set a good example.Out of the 31 teams formed for the campaign, 17 are of Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s (DPCC) engineers and 14 of green marshals who will work with mobile vans. A DPCC team will be deployed in each of the five districts — East, North East, South East, South West and Shahdara, while two teams each will work in New Delhi, North West, North, South, West and Central Delhi. Green marshals will be deployed in all districts. The Delhi government earlier issued a 14-point guideline on dust management. “All teams have been trained about what to do and how to identify violations. They will be uploading the complaints on the Green Delhi app, which will be monitored through Green War Room and resolved,” the minister said. “If we observe that any department is not taking suitable action, a show-cause notice will be issued. If the department is unable to clarify within two days, it will be penalised. If pollution continues due to that activity, DPCC may direct its shutting down for the time being,” Rai said. The fine will be imposed on the basis of the National Green Tribunal guidelines of 2016 for construction sites, he added. The amount will vary from Rs 10,000 to Rs 5 lakh, depending on the plot size. The portal will be launched on Thursday. “Through this portal, all construction agencies will have to comply with the checklist and conduct a self-audit on it. The website will help with the management of dust pollution,” said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/month-long-drive-to-fight-dust-pollution/articleshow/86820374.cms||---

Two event organisers, Akash Patwa and Hemal Patel, urged the HC to direct the government to permit commercial garbas at party plots, particularly when it has granted permission for Navratri events in streets and housing societies with various conditions including maximum participation of 400 persons, mandatory two-dose vaccination and other SOPs to be followed. The petitioners argued that when non-commercial garba events are permitted, the authorities may grant permission to commercial events and the petitioners are ready to comply with any condition imposed. There cannot be such a blanket ban on commercial garba events, particularly when all other commercial activities at restaurants, malls are permitted. There is no reason for banning commercial garba events, petitioners’ lawyer argued. On hearing this, Justice Sangeeta Vishen said, “Other activities cannot be compared with Navratri. The reason? writ large. Everybody knows the reason. So far as Gujarat is concerned, the (Covid) situation is controlled…We all know with what civility the citizens observe (Covid) guidelines.” The court also asked the petitioner how it can venture into the government’s policy decision and orders issued under Section 144 of CrPC. It sought the government’s response on the issue on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-reply-sought-on-plea-to-hold-commercial-garbas/articleshow/86819113.cms||---

Yes, garba is finally being organised this Navratri, ringing in the good times and revelry that will last over the next nine nights! Despite restrictions imposed by the state including the ban on commercial garba, limiting the garba to private, closed-group events with a cap of 400 persons and allowing only double-shot vaccinated individuals to enjoy the festive revelry, the enthusiasm of khelaiyas, enthusiasts, artists and singers, performers and even brands and businesses, knows no bounds! “I will certainly miss going to clubs and different venues for Navratri, the fun is at a different level. However, the fact that garba is being organised is a big deal this time. I look forward to it even if I get to spend only an hour or two at garba,” said Chandani Korat, prosthetist based in Ahmedabad. Some people, despite being enthusiastic about Navratri are also cautious in the wake of the pandemic. “I have not just organised garba during Navratri over the past years, I am equally keen on celebrating and enjoying the revelry during the festival. However, this year, I am neither organising nor celebrating simply for safety reasons. Even though garba will be organised in my society,” said Tushar Panchal, a city-based garba organiser. The business community is upbeat about positive consumer sentiment, and good business, especially in the apparel, automobile and hospitality industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nine-nights-of-revelry-begin/articleshow/86819133.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: People from various walks of life come together to be part of Katra Ramlila||PRAYAGRAJ: Apart from Mumbai based actors and artists from local theatre groups, religious devotion and passion for Ramlila are also attracting people from different fields like teaching, business and other walks of life onto the stage to perform and be a part of the decades-old Katra Ramlila. For instance, city-based businessman Rishabh Gupta, who will enact the role of Lord Ram, is putting in the extra effort and hours required to do justice to his role. Pragya Kesarwani, who teaches in a private school, will be seen in the role of Goddess Sita in the Ramlila. Interestingly, both Gupta and Kesarwani, given their profession and busy schedule, still manage to dedicate at least four to five hours a day for rehearsals as Katra Ramlila, which is all set to begin from today. Subodh Singh, director, Katra Ramlila says, “Rishabh Gupta’s elder sister Manisha Gupta had played the role of Sita for four consecutive years and he (Rishabh) used to pick and drop his sister for the Ramlila rehearsal and shows. This year, Rishabh, despite having a busy and tight schedule, approached Katra Ramlila committee authorities and wished for a role on the stage in Ramlila which arises from his religious devotion.” Director Subodh Singh also said, “Hailing from a leading business family in the city, Rishabh Gupta was adamant to perform a role and he finally got the character of Lord Shri Ram after auditioning”. Similarly, Pragya Kesarwani, who has been associated with various Ramlila in the city since childhood, was keen to play a bigger role in Katra Ramlila. Pragya, a teacher by profession who teaches in a private school, moves straight to the Ramlila auditorium for rehearsals. “Pragya has been performing Ramlila since she was 13 years old and was pursuing her class VIIIth studies,” said the director, Subodh Singh. “She had done many roles in Katra Ramlila, including that of Urmila, Sulochana and demon queen Shurpanakha. However, this time, she will be playing the role of Goddess Sita,” added Singh. Pragya had earlier worked in the Patharchatti Ramlila committee also. Moreover, there are more than a dozen actors playing different roles in Ramlila who have professional degrees under their belt and are working professionals. However, it is their devotion towards Ramayana and Ramlila that brings them on stage together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/people-from-various-walks-of-life-come-together-to-be-part-of-katra-ramlila/articleshow/86820364.cms||Kapil Dixit

The court observed in its order that the child accused /appellant had been charged with murder of the complainant’s son and for destroying the evidence which clearly showed that his mother had no control over him and he was of perverted mentality. There were all possibilities that he might join the company of perverted people and become involved in criminal activity if released from judicial custody. “If bail is granted in such types of cases, it will give a wrong message to the society and defeat the purpose of justice”, the court said. Citing a ruling of the high court, the court observed that the order passed by the juvenile justice board had no illegality or irregularity. According to Sushil Kumar Verma, additional district, government counsel, the complainant, in the case, who was mother of deceased Akash Pal, stated in her complaint that his 19-year-old son was a student of class XII. He was studying with Mrigendra Mishra alias Rachit, a resident of Awas Vikas Colony Naubasta. He along with his tenant Luvkush alias Chhotu used to visit her house. Mrigendra and Chhotu had come to her house on April 28, 2021 and took her son Akash on a motorcycle. When her son did not return, she lodged a complaint at the Naubasta police station and inquired from Mrigendra’s father about her son. The CCTV footage later showed that Mrigendra and Chhotu had taken Akash to some place in their motorcycle. Aman Pal, her younger son too informed his mother that he had seen Mrigendra, Chhotu and Akash Pal were going on a motorcycle. On April 29 last, police informed her that a dead body was found under Chakri police circle which she identified as that of Akash Pal. The Babupurwa police had registered a case of kidnapping, murder and destroying the evidence and arrested Mrigendra Mishra who was later declared as juvenile. The juvenile justice board had rejected his bail application on the report of the probationary officer. The probationary officer in his report stated that there were all possibilities that the accused could join a company of perverted people after which the juvenile justice board rejected the bail application on September 17, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pocso-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused-challenging-order-of-juvenile-justice-board/articleshow/86820375.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Bombay Chamber activities charitable, eligible for tax exemption’||MUMBAI: The 185-year-old Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), India’s oldest business chamber, has been successful in its claim that its activities are “charitable” in nature and it is thus entitled to income-tax (I-T) exemption. The Mumbai bench of the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), in its recent order, allowed BCCI’s appeal. The chamber enables hundreds of industry stalwarts, other businessmen and professionals to network with one another. Its role in policy formulation dates back to the mid-1800s when it was largely responsible for the first railway built in India— the Bombay-Thana railway line—which was completed in 1853. BCCI played a stellar role in helping introduce various legislations and was incorporated as a non-profit company in 1924. Today, it has moved beyond its advocacy role with the government. It plays a larger role of “corporate as a citizen” by promoting good governance and also promoting arts and culture. If a registered trust or non-profit entity is engaged in charitable activities, its income is exempt under Section 11 of the I-T Act. According to Section 2 (15), the term “charitable purpose” includes “advancement of any other object of general public utility”. A proviso to this section, introduced from April 1, 2009, provides that this definition no longer holds good if the non-profit entity carries on any activity or provides any service in the nature of trade, commerce or business for a consideration. Certain exceptions are carved out though. If such activities are undertaken in the course of carrying out its main objectives; or if the receipts from such activities do not exceed the stipulated amount in a financial year, then the terms of Section 2 (15) are not violated. In such cases, the non-profit entity is entitled to I-T exemption under Section 11. For the financial year 2008-09, the chamber claimed exemption under Section 11. The I-T officer denied this claim, though, on the ground that it had “rendered services in relation to commercial activity for which fees were charged” such as by conducting seminars or selling publications. It also earned an interest income. The commissioner (appeals) also agreed with this view, which led the chamber to appeal before the tax tribunal. The ITAT bench, comprising Mahavir Singh, vice-president, and Manoj Kumar Aggarwal, accountant member, observed that the dominant object of the trust or non-profit entity has to be looked at, including the manner and form in which the objects are achieved. The bench lent weightage to the spirit of the law, “...the intent of the legislation was to curb the practice of claiming exemption on the pretext of carrying out objects of general public utility and thereby taking the benefit of exemption in respect of business carried out in the mask of charity,” it pointed out. The bench added that it was clear that the members of the chamber did not stand to gain personally, as no portion of the income or property was paid or transferred to them directly or indirectly. “These facts highlight the fundamental point that the chamber by and large strives to promote and protect the trade, commerce and manufacturers of India without seeking to make profits for its members,” summed up the ITAT. Thus, the bench held it to be eligible for I-T exemption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-chamber-activities-charitable-eligible-for-tax-exemption/articleshow/86820376.cms||Lubna Kably

BJP councillors who have been protesting in the council wore black cloth wrapped around their mouth. The mayor, however, asked the health standing committee chairperson to present the action plan which was objected to by UDF parliamentary party leader Padmakumar. He said that it was decided in the all party meeting that all matters regarding the fund fraud will be presented in the council. The LDF heads of standing committees backed the mayor and said that a special council may begin with the action plan and then the mayor may present a statement as demanded by the UDF. The councillors, however, did not accept this and they moved to the well of the council hall protesting and walked out of the council raising slogans. Meanwhile, the BJP councillors took part in the discussion on plastic ban. Later the mayor reiterated that the corporation will not pass a resolution demanding the arrest of persons who have been suspended in various zonal offices in connection with the fund fraud. “If there is a lapse on the part of police in the investigation, we will take it up with the Chief Minister. Non-bailable offences have been charged against the two staff at zonal office. The investigation and further action will take its own course,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/udf-walks-out-of-special-council/articleshow/86792327.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Art expo opens new avenues for artists||Thiruvananthapuram: With art expos and creative workshops becoming a rarity in the wake of pandemic, a set of artists recently got together here for a mission envisaged by the Lalithakala Akademi. The artists worked on paintings and sculptures at their homes and the akademi pooled around 250 such paintings and 50 sculptures which are now on display in different galleries across the state, including the gallery at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan. The paintings measuring three by four feet in size are done with acrylic paint on canvas. The artists themselves were in charge of transporting the paintings to the galleries. The sculptures are made with a variety of materials, including wood, granite, cement and mixed materials. The artists can take their artworks featured in the exhibition home once the show is finished. They can also sell them during the exhibition. The idea for the project was born after the epidemic struck Kerala’s artists very badly as the order for paintings also decreased. “The Lalithakala Akademi chose to assist them at the moment by supplying colours and canvas to the artists at their residence. We have got a large number of creative works in this exhibition,” said Nemom Pushparaj, chairman of the Lalithakala Akademi. “My artwork in this exhibition is about a protest I have done against land mining. The mining has the potential to harm the natural resources. It also represents the current generation, which is not preserving the natural resources for future generations. This initiative has become a great relief to all the artists in Kerala. During the pandemic, most of the artists were struggling since they could not afford to buy canvas or colours. I would like to express my gratitude to the Akademi for initiating such a project,” said Suresh Muttathi one of the artists taking part in the expo. Suresh Muttathi is an artist and environmental activist who led many revolutions on behalf of environmental protection, the protest for Chalakudy river was one among the many. His paintings are mostly about environmental protection. As an art director, he has also proved his efficiency in in international dramas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/art-expo-opens-new-avenues-for-artists/articleshow/86792393.cms||---

Herman Joyson Lobo, a resident of Belthangady, was arrested at the Delhi Airport on October 3 following a look out circular (LOC) issued against him by the Mangaluru city police. City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said on Wednesday that the accused had collected money from gullible people by promising them high returns after investing it in shares. “He got money from people saying that he will give them 10-12 % interest a month while they would get just 6-7 % interest in the banks. Initially, he paid them as promised and gained their trust. People realised that they have been cheated whenhe started defaulting on payments,” said the commissioner. Shashi Kumar said, as per the information available so far, the accused has cheated about 30 people in the last three years and two cases have been registered against him. “He may have duped more people. I request people who have been cheated by him to come forward and lodge a complaint with CEN police station,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-cons-investors-of-rs-50-lakh-held-in-delhi/articleshow/86818998.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Endosulfan victims being failed again’||Thiruvananthapuram: Extending support to the Endosulfan victims protesting before the secretariat, the opposition on Wednesday raised the victims’ grievances in the assembly alleging that the government has not been able to implement the Supreme Court order pronounced four years ago. The opposition also pointed out that the remediation cell set up for coordinating various departments to address the grievances of Endosulfan victims has been dysfunctional for the past one year. Quoting the numbers and the Supreme Court verdict, opposition leader V D Satheesan said as many as 3,713 victims in the list have not received any financial help yet though the court had ordered in 2017 to disburse Rs 5 lakh each to them within three months. “As many as 1,031 persons who were found to be victims of Endosulfan in 2017 itself have not been included in the list of the affected. There are no trauma care centres or even neurologists in any of the hospitals in the district and they are forced to go to Mangaluru. After the pandemic broke out, it has become more difficult to visit the hospitals due to travel restrictions and as a result, as many 20 children have died in the area,” Satheesan said. Citing Rachel Carson’s environmental classic “Silent Spring” that drew attention to the dangers of toxic chemicals such as DDT entering the food chain, which subsequently led courts to fix “strict liability” on the companies responsible, Satheesan said the Supreme Court in the country has modified strict liability to “ultimate liability” on those responsible. In the case of Endosulfan, it is the state which is responsible, and ultimate responsibility lies with the state, he said. The opposition also vehemently criticized the report of former Kasaragod district collector D Sajith Babu who had recommended that the list of Endosulfan victims has to be revised as several ineligible persons have been included in it. “The list was prepared after three rounds of medical screening. The district collector says it is wrong. The government should clarify whether it is the government’s policy,” he said. Social justice and higher education minister R Bindu said the collector’s report is not the government’s policy in the matter. Assuring that the remediation cell will be reconstituted soon, the minister read out a list of financial aid under various schemes and programmes already given to the victims, including Rs 171 crore as compensation, Rs 16.8 crore for the treatment of the victims, and waiving of power bills. She also said that the work on setting up a he medical college in Kasargod is progressing. Earlier, raising the matter, Kasaragod MLA N A Nellikkunnu said the former collector has been behaving as if he is the agent of Endosulfan manufacturing companies and demanded that the government should make its stand clear with regards to his recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/endosulfan-victims-being-failed-again/articleshow/86820435.cms||---

He said the entire country was a witness to the struggles of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi against violence in Lakhimpur Kheri and the "dictatorship" of BJP-led government in UP and the Centre. "The Uttar Pradesh government had to eventually hear the voice of the nation and release Priyanka ji after an illegal custody of 52 hours," he tweeted. The AICC general secretary was detained in Sitapur early Monday on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri where eight people were killed the previous day. While four of the dead in Sunday's incident were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, the others included BJP workers and their driver who were allegedly lynched. Gehlot noted that Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and other Congress leaders are going there to meet the bereaved families of farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and console them. “It is surprising that no culprits have been arrested so far. The central government should intervene in the matter to ensure that those guilty are arrested and the victims get justice,” he said in another tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-seeks-centres-intervention-in-lakhimpur-violence-case/articleshow/86820422.cms||---

In the same way, I have only asked for the respect of our colleagues. You give me respect or not, it hardly matters. I have achieved a lot, I have been a minister as well as a president. Now I have also become the national president. I even said on 22 November 2020 that if this is the desire, we will not even contest elections. Even today I had called and messaged him (Akhilesh) that it is necessary to talk to defeat the BJP, but he hasn’t got a reply yet,” said Shivpal. He said that everyone needs to be united to oust BJP from power. “Even though Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) did not want me to leave SP, I was separated from the SP,” he said and added, “I had said earlier also that if everyone unites then Akhilesh will become the Chief Minister,” he said. Further speaking on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, he said that “Union Minister of state Ajay Mishra is a history-sheeter criminal”. “In a state where there will be ministers against whom murder cases are registered, then tell what will happen in the state. Government should take strict action against such ministers,” he said. He added, “We were going to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the aggrieved farmers, but the government did not allow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/its-enough-im-waiting-for-a-war-shivpal/articleshow/86820397.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Foresters rescue elephant calf from pit in Nilgiris, reunite it with herd||UDHAGAMANDALAM: A month-old elephant calf found stuck in a pit in Pandalur forest range in the Nilgiris was rescued and reunited with its herd on Tuesday. Pandalur residents, who were alerted by the loud trumpeting of a herd of elephants on Tuesday morning, had informed forest department officials. Forest personnel conducted a search and found a female elephant calf in a mining pit in Goldmine RL area. “Usually, a nursing herd, comprising only female elephants, would be accompanying calves. May be after sensing the arrival of the forest team, the herd had left the place,” forest range officer Prasad Ganesan told TOI. It took nearly two hours for the forest team to rescue the calf from the pit. “The calf might have fallen into the pit the previous night. The herd trumpeted for help to rescue the calf,” said the official. As the calf looked weak, it was fed Lactogen and glucose with the help of mahouts at the Gene Pool Eco Park. The team waited for more than two hours for the nursing herd to return to the place, but in vain. The calf was left inside a nearby small pit and was monitored. A team was formed to search for the mother elephant and the herd. By 5pm, a herd was found a kilometre away. “We did not carry the calf to the herd as elephants are very sensitive to smell. If human scent is found, the herd might abandon the calf,” said Ganesan. “We made the calf walk a kilometre to reach the herd.” But when the team left the calf close to the herd and left the place, the calf followed the team. “Two elephants from the herd came forward, threatening to charge the team. As it was a difficult terrain, we had to safeguard ourselves. Hence, we tied the legs of the calf with a whistle cord and left the place around 8pm,” Ganesan said. On Wednesday, the team found the whistle cord and a trail of footprints left by the herd. “We ensured that the herd took the calf along. Elephants care for their young ones and family members like we do,” the official added.

Three African nationals were arrested for running the alleged drug racket. Stanley Chimeize Alasonye, 41, identified by police as the mastermind of the illegal operations, Henry Okolie, 41, and Uchechukwu Peter Igbonaju, 37, were arrested with 1.3kg of heroin, 4.5kg of chemicals and equipment to prepare saleable heroin. These African nationals had outlived their visas to India. According to police, they regularly received information through sources about some African nationals importing and distributing drugs in areas like Uttam Nagar and Mohan Garden. “This raised an alarm and a deployment operation was launched which involved careful observation and tracking of possible suspects,” a police officer said. “Soon we could zero in on a group involved in drug peddling and mounted technical surveillance for more information.” Based on a tip-off, the cops reached Mohan Garden on October 1 and were able to intercept Okolie and Igbonaju with 1kg heroin in their possession. The two men, police established, came to India in 2019 via Bangladesh. The officer revealed, “The two arrested men had rented two rooms on different floors in a building in Mohan Garden. They lived on the ground floor and had set up a factory on the top floor, from where we seized chemicals and equipment used for processing raw heroin.”  Following their interrogation, police arrested Alasonye on October 4 and seized 300gm of heroin from him.” The officer revealed, “Alasonye procured the drug from an African vendor and had a large customer base in Delhi. Big vendors contacted the retailers through virtual numbers and supplied the drugs at the retailers’ locations here.” During questioning, Igbonaju admitted to receiving the contraband they sold from a foreign national based in Africa. He said that the African was a big supplier of drugs and had a large customer base in Delhi. He was a supplier of various drugs such as cocaine, heroin, MDMA (ecstasy), etc. Igbonaju also disclosed that the communication among the supplier and the peddlers/vendors was through mobile phone sporting virtual numbers. The seized heroin had been smuggled into India from Nigeria via Russia by using Indian ports. Contraband drugs were regularly brought into the country through cross-border smuggling across Bangladesh and Nepal. The three arrested men were presented in a court from where permission was obtained to keep them in remand with police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heroin-factory-busted-rs-13cr-drugs-and-chemicals-seized/articleshow/86822310.cms||---

Replying to a calling attention motion by MLA M K Muneer who invited the attention of the government towards the need to set up a skill development authority, the chief minister said that the government is exploring the possibilities of work-from-home mode and are planning to include more people under the skill development initiatives. Regarding the same matter, general education and labour minister V Sivankutty said that the government is ready with the draft skill policy of the state government, and it will be finalized after discussions with other stakeholder departments. The minister said that even though there are some gaps in coordination in the absence of a skill development authority, the government has entrusted Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence (KASE) as the state’s skill development mission. In addition, to bring the state’s skill development initiatives under a single umbrella and coordinate them, KASE has been designated as the skill secretariat. Raising the matter, Muneer said that there are a multitude of skill development initiatives by various bodies under the government, including the additional skills acquisition programme (ASAP) under the education department, KASE under the labour and skills department, ICT Academy, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY) under Kudumbashree and agencies like Keltron and C-DIT are operating their own skill development programmes. “Despite having these many programmes, we are unable to achieve the goals in skill development. There should be an authority that should be headed by the chief minister, which gives accreditations to various skill development programmes, and coordinate between them,” Muneer said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/skill-devpt-a-priority-for-govt-pinarayi/articleshow/86820472.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||3 UP cops among four killed as car crashes into parked truck near Gwalior||AGRA: In a split second, four-year-old Chitransh Singh’s birthday celebration turned tragic. Grief, loss and bereavement replaced the celebrations as soon as the news of the death of his father Manish Kumar Singh, 32, reached the family on Wednesday. Singh, a sub-inspector (SI), was posted at Beswan chowki in Aligarh. He was among four people (three policemen and a driver) who were killed after their vehicle rammed into a truck in Madhya Pradesh’s Morena district on Wednesday morning. Speaking to TOI, Singh’s father-in-law Raj Kumar, who is posted as an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in Hapur, said, “It was Manish’s elder son Chitransh’s fourth birthday. Everyone was in a celebratory mood and then this devastating news came…I don’t know how to convey the news of her husband’s death to my daughter Priyanka. Their younger son is just 10 months old.” According to officials, the police team was on its way to arrest a theft accused. The team was pursuing the thief, tracking his mobile location, when the accident happened around 3.30 am at the Agra-Mumbai national highway near Banmore, around 30km from Gwalior. Besides Singh, the other deceased have been identified as head constable Sunil Kumar, 34, a resident of Firozabad, constable Pawan Kumar, 33, from Agra, and driver Deepak Kumar, 20, from Aligarh. A constable Ram Kumar, 30, sustained injuries in the mishap and is said to be critical. All the cops were in uniform. As per eyewitnesses, police had a hard time freeing the vehicle, which was stuck under the truck.Morena police have registered a case and are looking for the truck driver. Meanwhile, relatives of the victims were yet to come to terms with the tragedy. Dheeraj Kumar, cousin of constable Pawan Kumar, told TOI, “I am at a loss for words. My father and two elder brothers have gone to Morena.” Sheela Devi, mother of the vehicle driver Deepak Kumar, was inconsolable “Deepak had just bought a new Renault Triber. He had told me he would be back from work shortly. I don’t know how this could happen.” Morena SP Lalit Shakyawar said it appeared the driver might have dozed off and rammed the vehicle into the parked truck. Accidents due to vehicles parked on road shoulders are alarmingly high in MP. In 2019, 81 people were killed and 262 injured in such accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-up-cops-among-four-killed-as-car-crashes-into-parked-truck-near-gwalior/articleshow/86819187.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Notices issued to seize property, arrest doctors over Rs 10 lakh bond||AHMEDABAD: To tighten the noose around doctors who did not respond on being summoned for Covid-19 duty during the second wave, the state government has started issuing notices to them for attachment of their properties or properties belonging to the guarantors who stood for them in lieu of the Rs 10-lakh bond executed during admission to PG medical courses. The state government had ordered doctors who studied at government medical colleges and yet to discharge their bonds, to join Covid duty. In the notices issued under provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code in September, the government authorities asked the doctors to either pay the bond amount and discharge themselves from the mandatory three-year rural service or properties belonging to them or their legal heirs or their guarantors would be attached and put on auction to recover the Rs 10 lakh bond amount. In case of failure to pay the amount, the government also threatened to arrest them and put them behind bars and said that a proposal to this effect would be sent to the collectors and district magistrates concerned. This threat has created panic among doctors and those who stood guarantors when they took admission and their families did not have enough money to pay off the bonds, and had relied on relatives to stand as guarantors. In some cases, medical college authorities have issued notices to former students asking them to pay Rs 10 lakh and get themselves discharged from the bond. They have been given a seven-day period to pay up or the bank guarantee issued at the time of their admission would be forfeited. Following the government’s communications, as many as 45 doctors have paid the bond amount and freed themselves from the liability. They are among 251 doctors, who had taken admission to PG medical courses before 2013, and who have approached the Gujarat high court against the state government’s notices issued in June for failure to turn up for Covid duty. During the hearing on Wednesday, the petitioner doctors’ advocate, Amit Panchal, raised the issue. In response, the government pleader promised the court that the authorities would be told to go slow against the doctors in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/notices-issued-to-seize-property-arrest-doctors-over-rs-10l-bond/articleshow/86819188.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid, non-Covid balance on hospitals’ Puja roster||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals in Kolkata will be reverting to their pre-pandemic roster for doctors and nurses in non-Covid wards during the festive days next week. At Covid wards, however, presence of the existing strength of personnel will continue even as some have decided to extend their Covid units and be ready to deploy more health workers at a short notice in case there is a spurt. While Peerless Hospital will continue to depute six consultants, at least eight nurses and 10 junior doctors at its Covid ward that now has just 21 admitted it will return to its 2019 roster for the rest of the wards. “We have very few planned surgeries or admissions during the Pujas, which allows us to have a smaller workforce. Since there has been no spurt in Covid numbers so far, we expect the trend to continue during the Pujas. But we will not reduce the workforce at the ward,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Last Puja, Peerless had to cancel doctors’ leaves since it had more 100 Covid patients. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) , too, will be reverting to its pre-pandemic roster for doctors and nurses. But it will continue to have more than the usual number of doctors and nurses at the Covid ward since cases have increased slightly, according to RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh. “We have 47 Covid beds with an occupancy of 32, with 16 critical care patients. If we see a steady rise in cases, we will add more beds as we have the infrastructure ready. For non-Covid wards, though, we will return to the pre-pandemic roster,” said Venkatesh. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has already revived its pre-pandemic roster for non-Covid wards. “We have just 26 Covid patients now. Admissions will drop sharply during the Puja days, so we will allow Puja leaves to our doctors and nurses. We will call them back in case there’s an unexpected spurt either in Covid or non-Covid admissions,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. AMRI Hospitals will not alter its schedule for doctors at non-Covid wards, though. “We will stick to last year’s routine and have a strong presence of health workers across wards. While the number of non-Covid patients could drop, we will accommodate more Covid patients in case there is a spurt,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Ruby Hospital, too, has decided against reviving its 2019 roster. Like AMRI, it will add more Covid beds and will stick to its usual roster for health workers during the festival. “We will have 25 Covid beds across two wards, including several critical care ones. There has been a marginal spurt in Covid admissions over the last few days. So, we are not taking it easy,” said Ruby general manager (operations) Subhashish Datta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-non-cov-balance-on-hosps-puja-roster/articleshow/86819218.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The couple who are both major and from the same village had married in January. They filed a petition in Allahabad high court seeking protection. The HC had ordered Bijnor police to "grant protection to the petitioners and restrain family members from undue interference". But the cops were doing the "family's bidding". The couple then approached a minister for help. Swami Prasad Maurya, the state minister for labour and employment, intervened and sent a letter to the additional chief secretary for a fair probe.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Swollen Kallar washes away road||Thiruvananthapuram: A panchayat road in the Kallar ward, situated on the foothills of Ponmudi, suffered major damages after the Kallar river overflowed due to the heavy rains the district received on Tuesday afternoon. The panchayat road that leads from Kallar to Mottamood tribal settlement suffered the damages. Nearly half of the road was washed away when a tributary of Kallar river that ran parallel to the road overflowed. Besides this, a tree and two electric poles fell across the Ponmudi road near Golden Valley, affecting vehicular traffic. According to Vithura police, the water level of the river started to rise around 3 pm. After three hours the retaining wall of the road swept away. Soon, portions of the asphalt road too caved in due to the strong currents. Vishnu Anappara, the ward member of Anappara ward nearby, who visited the spot, said the local residents were not in any immediate danger. ''The other half of the road still seems to be motorable and the residents of the tribal settlements here are not at the risk of getting isolated,” he said adding that the panchayat authorities, senior officers of police and revenue department have visited the region and assessed the damages in view of taking precautionary measures. Famed traditional medicine practitioner and Padma Shri award winner Lakshmikutty resides at the Mottamood tribal settlement. The tree that fell across the Kallar bridge and the two electric poles that fell across the road nearby were removed by the fire and rescue services personnel. The police also said that no casualties were reported as Kallar ward still continues to be a containment zone and tourism was closed here. PWD officials of Nedumangad sub division said though there was no news yet regarding damages caused to the road leading to Ponmudi, they are worried about the progress of maintenance works they launched last week following damages suffered in rains during June. They will be inspecting the worksites on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/swollen-kallar-washes-away-road/articleshow/86792457.cms||---

The gang was allegedly being run by Khalistan separatists settled abroad. The anti-terror federal probe agency returned after handing over notice to their families which asked the two suspects to appear at their office in Chandigarh on October 8 for questioning. The first case in the alleged extortion racket was registered in Moga on May 22 this year. And after the names of separatists cropped up, the NIA took over the probe in the case on June 10. In July, it had arrested an alleged arms trafficker from Meerut. “Gagandeep Singh was involved in smuggling of weapons on the directions of Arshdeep, one of the main accused in the case and a close aide of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , the chief of Khalistan Tiger Force,” the NIA had said in a statement then. The NIA team accompanied by Chandigarh police raided two houses in Radhna village on Tuesday. According to sources, the homes of Jalish Ahmad and Mohd Khilafat were raided. NIA served notice to the family of Khilafat and asked his son Akbar Soni to be present at its Chandigarh office. The notice accessed by the TOI, stated, “Whereas it appears that you are acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the NIA case noted below, which is now being investigated by NIA. You are hereby directed to appear on October 8, at NIA branch office Chandigarh for the purpose of examination.” Radhna village has seen several such NIA raids, at least six in the last over two years. And all those booked and arrested were accused of supplying illegal arms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/punjabs-extortion-racket-nia-raids-meerut-village-in-search-of-2-suspects/articleshow/86816326.cms||Sandeep Rai

All hospitals have been asked to make roster for their own vaccination team so that whoever turns up at the centres get the jab. On Ashtami, OPD services will also be shut for a day. Health officials said that the footfall at the centres is likely to fall sharply during the five-day festivity as recipient themselves might not want to take the jab during this period. But they will keep the services open for whoever comes to take the shot. “Since the footfall is likely to drop sharply during the festival, hospitals can reduce the number of sites depending on the response. But they will have to keep the inoculation drive on expect on Ashtami,” said a senior health official. “It is likely that we might get less first-dose recipients. But people whose second dose is due are likely to turn up. We will be offering the jab to either category of recipients,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, vaccination coordinator at Beliaghata ID hospital. On Tuesday, Bengal crossed the 6-crore jab mark when around 10 lakh doses were administered.

Replying to a calling attention motion by MLA H Salam, the minister added that the government is also considering conducting the Nehru Trophy boat race in a bio-bubble model. The minister said that the concept of houseboats in the tourism sector were introduced in the 1980s. Now, the government has come up with caravan tourism, another innovative initiative. What makes the caravan tourism attractive is that it will help tourists explore unexplored tourism destinations, where there are no accommodation facilities, Riyas said. The caravan parking centres that are envisaged in such places will turn the locations into a main cultural hub, and would also generate economic activities in that location, he added. He said that the government is aiming at 100% vaccinated tourism destinations, and Vythiri in Wayanad has already achieved this goal and the nation has taken note of it. The government has initiated multiple schemes to address the issues that adversely affected the tourism sector due to the pandemic, including schemes like working capital support scheme, employment support scheme, revolving fund, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/normalcy-returning-to-tourist-spots-min/articleshow/86820530.cms||---

Kumar is believed to have supplied drugs to two of the arrested accused. With this, the number of arrests in the case has gone up to 17. Meanwhile, the NCB on Wednesday produced all the four arrested directors of the Delhi-based event management company Namas’cray Experience Private Limited — Gopal Jee Anand, Samir Sehgal, Manav Singhal and Bhaskar Arora — before the 8th metropolitan magistrate, who remanded them in NCB custody till October 14. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said that the investigation has shown all these arrested persons were an integral part of the organizing team. The remand application seeking custody of the four said the plea for custody was in order to “confront these persons, along with the already arrested, primarily to find out and investigate in what manner the arrested persons boarded the ship and the event that took place before boarding the ship... it appears that the said four people are prima facie involved in harbouring offenders.” The application further stated, “It may be also noted that facts like the cruise having no licence/permission from DG Shipping, whether it was sea worthy or not, and whether proper tickets/invitations were issued to the concerned passengers will be an essential aspect of the investigations.” Bhaskar Arora’s lawyer opposed the NCB demand for his remand and sought his release. The lawyer said that Arora was arrested on October 4 but shown as arrested on 5 and was produced before court on October 6, which was “a clear violation and clear breach of constitutional safeguards.” He argued that there was no recovery of any contraband and no blood test was carried out. The court remanded him in NCB custody till October 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-more-held-from-powai-event-firm-directors-sent-to-custody/articleshow/86820510.cms||Ahmed Ali

They have threatened to stage a protest if the college goes ahead with the plan. Chiefs of VHP, Bajrang Dal and ABVP outfits on Wednesday, opposed the decision of St Aloysius College management to name the park after Father Swamy. VHP zonal secretary Sharan Pumpwell said that Swamy was arrested under the Unlawful Activities(Prevention) Act and was facing serious allegations like terrorism and naxalism— for his alleged role in the Bhima Koregoan violence. “It is an insult to the social system to name a park after him,” he said. The move by an old institution like St Aloysius College, which has contributed immensely to the field of education, to name a park after a person like Stan Swamy is akin to it indirectly challenging national unity and such a development is shocking. He said if the college management goes ahead with the plan, they will carry out a protest. “The college will be responsible if there is any untoward incident,” he cautioned. Pumpwell added they have conveyed their opposition to the college management and have submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner K V Rajendra. ABVP state secretary Manikanta said instead of Stan Swamy the college management can name it after personalities like former Union minister Oscar Fernandes or George Fernandes who have contributed to the country. To a query, he said they have no problem if the park is named after Stan Swamy once he is cleared of all charges. When TOI contacted, Rev Fr Melwin Joseph Pinto, rector, St Aloysius Institutions and vice-president, Mangalore Jesuit Educational Society, he said, “based on the suggestion of city police that President Ram Nath Kovind will be visiting the city on Thursday, we have postponed the programmes scheduled for Thursday.” However, the college refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/right-wing-forums-oppose-aloysius-colleges-move-to-name-park-after-stan-swamy/articleshow/86818955.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Rain, fuel price turn protein staples dearer||KOLKATA: There has been a sharp rise in retail prices of egg, fish and chicken across city markets owing to back-to-back downpours and subsequent release of barrage water, washing out fisheries, ponds and poultry farms in south Bengal. A steady rise in fuel prices has also contributed to the price rise. Worse, prices of these protein staples are unlikely to drop during the festive time. “In fact, prices of fish may rise further if the current situations persist,” said Tarun Bera, a fishery operator in East Midnapore. On an average, prices of fish rose by Rs 100-Rs 200 a kg. A poultry egg is now costlier by Re 1, dressed poultry chicken is now Rs 220, costlier by Rs 20-Rs 30 and may run up to Rs 250 during the festive days. “The kitchen budget has certainly gone haywire. Fish and eggs are daily essentials in any average Bengali household. The spike is going to burn bigger holes in our pockets,” said Swarup Nandi, en employee with a pharmaceutical company. “Record rainfall, followed by release of pent-up barrage water, washed away fisheries, ponds and rivers. Therefore, supply has dipped significantly. The gap is not easy to be met with imports from neighbouring states,” said Nuruddin Shah, a wholesale trader at Baruipur. The annual requirement of fish in Bengal 18.2 lakh tonnes. The annual production is now 18 lakh tonnes. “The daily demand for fish is around 5,192 tonnes. The supply is generally is 5,158 tonnes. But now the supply is much less. We are trying our best to take the supply to 5,041 tonnes during the festive days,” said Bengal fisheries minister Akhil Giri. If fish farms have incurred losses, so did the poultry farms in Hooghly, Howrah and two Midnapore — four key districts that supply bulk of the city’s egg and chicken requirement. “The losses are so huge this year because of natural calamities that many of the smaller players just cannot withstand the hardship and would exit the trade forever,” said Madan Maity, secretary of Bengal Poultry Federation. Egg price was hovering around Rs 5 a piece even a week ago. But rising fuel price is increasing the transportation cost almost on a daily basis. As a result, the wholesale price per box was raised by Rs 60. It may rise further during the festive days,” Narayan Chandra Pradhan, an egg retailer at Gariahat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-fuel-price-turn-protein-staples-dearer/articleshow/86819236.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Delhi||One of two judges hearing northeast Delhi riots cases transferred||NEW DELHI: One of the two judges hearing the 2020 northeast Delhi riots cases was on Wednesday transferred to another court in the national capital. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Vinod Yadav has been critical of the “callous and farcical” probe of Delhi Police in some of the riots cases and had even observed that failure to conduct a proper investigation will torment “sentinels of democracy.” In a reshuffle carried out by Delhi High Court, Yadav was transferred from Karkardooma District Courts to New Delhi district’s Rouse Avenue Court as Special Judge (PC Act) (CBI) in place of Judge Virender Bhatt, who will now be holding the post of ASJ in Karkardooma court. ASJ Yadav, a day before his transfer, had come down heavily on Delhi Police saying that “police witnesses are lying on oath” and giving contradictory statements, after one policeman identified three alleged rioters but another said that they could not be identified during the investigation. “This is a very sorry state of affairs,” Yadav had said and sought a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Police (northeast) in this regard. As the cases reached trial stage, the judge had been disapproving the investigation conducted by the police in some of the riots cases. and pulled them up at times for a “callous and farcical” probe and even imposed a fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-of-two-judges-hearing-ne-riots-cases-transferred/articleshow/86822424.cms||---

Hyderabad-based makers lab, T-Works, on Wednesday said it has designed and developed a cold-storage medical supplies payload with an autonomous release mechanism in collaboration with Hyderabad-based drone company Airserve Initiatives. This tech was demonstrated during the drone trial run between the Vikarabad Area Hospital to Madgulchittampalle primary healthcare centre as part of the Telangana government’s `Medicine from the Sky’ project. Until now, the staff at primary healthcare centres had to manually take out boxes after the drone landed but this posed the risk of drone damage as well as injury to the medical staff as they would otherwise have to be in close proximity to the drone and its propellers. The new solution incorporates a unique payload-release mechanism which automatically detaches the entire payload from the drone after it lands, with zero human intervention. Once detached, the drone immediately takes off to return to its home base. Commenting on the development, Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T-Works, said, “Over the past year T-Works has demonstrated multiple UAV related capabilities -- from developing fixed-wing beyond-visual-line-of-sight or BVLOS UAVs to building customised payloads. We worked with Airserve Initiatives to design and fabricate the payload to carry temperature sensitive medical supplies and a first-of-its-kind autonomous payload release mechanism.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-works-develops-drone-payload-release-tech/articleshow/86820513.cms||---

They are protesting against the policies of the central government that have made reopening of the mill a distant reality. The operations of the mill were stalled 19 months ago following the lockdown induced by Covid pandemic. Though all other industrial sectors have gradually returned to normalcy, many textile mills across the country under National Textile Corporation (NTC), including Vijayamohini mill, remained non-operational. The official explanation for the failure to restart operations is lack of availability of raw materials. The hunger strike has been launched under the aegis of Trivandrum Textile Workers Union (CITU). K N Gopinath, CITU state secretary, inaugurated the hunger strike on Tuesday. The strike on Wednesday will be inaugurated by CITU district secretary C Jayan Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/seeking-reopening-mill-workers-go-on-hunger-strike/articleshow/86792671.cms||---

The Congress MLA appealed to the farmers to realise that neither KCR nor Jagan had led any farmers agitations against the NDA government at the Centre or its contentious three farm laws, which are anti-farmer. Though KCR-led TRS participated once in a farmers’ Bharat Bandh, it made a U-turn after KCR’s meeting with PM Modi in New Delhi. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-jagan-mum-on-farmers-deaths/articleshow/86820600.cms||---

Replying to a submission by MLA A N Shamseer pointing out that some of the schools are denying TCs to the students when they seek to get transferred to schools near their houses, especially during the Covid-19 period, the minister said that anyone found violating this law will have to face action. The minister said that admissions to the school of their choice can be given only taking into consideration the physical conditions of the school, and in higher secondary classes, the transfer will be through a single window admission procedure. The minister said that there were some schools that had insisted that transfer certificates will be issued only if the full fee was paid and some schools had even issued legal notices to students demanding the full payment of fees. The government takes such matters very seriously, he said.

It’s the second most delayed withdrawal of the southwest monsoon in 40 years. Withdrawal from Delhi-NCR and remaining parts of north-west India is likely to be complete in the next 3-4 days. Announcing withdrawal of the southwest (summer) monsoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the monsoon has withdrawn from some parts of west Rajasthan and some parts of adjoining Gujarat on Wednesday. “Conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some more parts of Gujarat, entire Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Madhya Pradesh during the next 3-4 days,” it said. The southwest monsoon had seen the most delayed withdrawal in 2019 when the retreat started on October 9 as against its normal withdrawal date of September 17. Before 2019, the most delayed withdrawal was recorded in 1961. The monsoon withdrawal had commenced on September 28 last year while it happened on September 29 in 2018, on September 27 in 2017 and on September 15 in 2016. India this year received 'normal' monsoon rainfall during the four-month season from June to September. All India monsoon rainfall during June 1 to September 30 had been 87 cm against the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm of 1961-2010 (99% of its LPA). This is the third consecutive year when the country recorded rainfall in the 'normal' or 'above normal' category. Issuing weather forecasts for the next few days, the IMD predicted formation of a low-pressure area in north Andaman Sea around October 10 which may move west-north-westwards towards south Odisha and north Coastal Andhra Pradesh coast during subsequent 4-5 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monsoon-begins-to-withdraw-after-2nd-longest-delay-in-40-years/articleshow/86826485.cms||---
---||Delhi||Entire system is trying to shield perpetrators of violence: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Demanding justice from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said “the entire system” was trying to shield the perpetrators of the crime. Kejriwal said at a time when the country was celebrating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, political functionaries going to console the mourning families were being arrested. “This is what the tyrannical British used to do. Our forefathers did not get martyred in the struggle for freedom to see this day. What are you trying to hide from the nation?” he asked. “The truth is that there is no rule or respect for law left today. All people of this country are demanding justice for those farmers. You should sack the minister involved and meet the families of the victims. They will get some strength when the PM supports them,” said Kejriwal. Mentioning that he was talking on behalf of the people of the country, Kejriwal said, “Dear Mr Prime Minister, throughout the country everyone’s talking about how the entire system is trying to protect the murderers of the innocent farmers who died in Lakhimpur. It is a pressing matter that needs to be actively discussed.” The CM asked, “Why is there such a state of helplessness all around? Why are those murderers being protected? Those murderers barbarically ran their car over innocent farmers in broad daylight, and yet they haven’t been arrested.” “Do you know where we see criminals mercilessly running their cars over innocent people only to have the entire system bow down before them and shield them from the law? We only see it happen in Bollywood movies and the people of this country do not deserve to see it become a reality,” added Kejriwal. Claiming that the murderers didn’t just kill the group of farmers they ran over, but they also killed the spirit and soul of all farmers of this nation, Kejriwal said, “It feels like the car ran over the government and killed the entire system. The people of this country deserve to know the truth. They deserve to know who murdered those innocent farmers.” “Today, the system is claiming that the minister’s son was not present in that car at all. A week later, they will say there was no car at all. A week after that, they will say there were no farmers at that spot,” said Kejriwal, adding that farmers were protesting for over a year and 600 had lost their lives till now. Kejriwal said every person in the country was seeing on TV and social media that “a car came, murdered people and no action was taken against them”. “What message do you want to give to this country by protecting the murderers? Is there no value of life left for you? If someone’s a politician or a rich and powerful person, can they get away with murder under your watch?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/entire-system-is-trying-to-shield-perpetrators-of-violence-kejriwal/articleshow/86822450.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Kingpin, 5 others held in Telugu Akademi FD fraud||HYDERABAD: Six more persons, including alleged mastermind Chunduri Venkata Koti Sai Kumar, were arrested for their role in the Rs 64.5 crore Telugu Akademi fixed deposit fraud on Wednesday. Apart from Sai Kumar, a businessman from Hyderabad, his his partners in cirme — Telugu Akademi accounts officer Segoori Ramesh, Canara Bank’s Chandanagar branch manager M Sadhana, N Venkata Raman from Tanuku, Venkateshwar Rao alias Dr Venkat from Khammam and Somashekhar, a realtor from Dharmavaram — have been arrested. Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said Sai Kumar had committed similar offences in the past and he scripted the FD fraud and executed it with the help of other accused. The accused fraudulently withdrew 43 fixed deposits (FDs) of Telugu Akademi from Union Bank of India’s Karwan and Santosh Nagar branches and Canara Bank’s Chandanagar branch between December 2020 and September 2021, the CP said. To execute the fraud, Sai Kumar had contacted Telugu Akademi accounts officer Ramesh, who handed over cheques to Somasekhar and Venkat to deposit them in banks as fixed deposits in the name of the Akademi. “The accused initially deposited the amount in the fake Telugu Akademi accounts created at AP Mercantile Cooperative Credit Society Ltd using forged documents and from there it was transferred to AP Mercantile Cooperative Credit Society’s account in Agrasen Bank, Siddiamber Bazar. From Agrasen Bank, the accused withdrew cash and shared it between them,” Hyderabad joint commissioner of police Avinash Mohanty said. Anjani Kumar said the fraud was executed with active connivance of bank officials and the responsibility was with banks to compensate the money, which belongs to the Telangana government. Avinash Mohanty said the accused had deposited cheques issued by the Akademi in banks and booked FDs for a short term using forged letters. After the maturity of the deposit, they transferred the amount to Telugu Akademi’s account created at AP Mercantile Cooperative Credit Society. “The forged FD receipts for a different time period were sent to Telugu Akademi mentioning the details provided by the bank officials,” the joint CP said. Sai Kumar and his associates told Telugu Akademi and bank officials that they were using the amount for investment purpose and the money would be returned before the due date of the deposit mentioned in the original letter issued by the Akademi with cheques. “We will seek police custody of the accused to gather more details,” Mohanty said. In the FD fraud case, three FIRs had been registered so far based on separate complaints from the bank and Telugu Akademi officials. CCS had already arrested Union Bank of India, Karwan, chief manager Mastan Vali, AP Mercantile Cooperative Credit Society Limited , Vijayawada, chairman/MD Satyanaryana, Society, manager (operations), Hyderabad, V Padmavathi and AP Mercantile Cooperative Credit Society Ltd relationship manager Syed Moiuddin. Investigators said 10 to 11 more people are likely to be arrested in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kingpin-5-others-held-in-akademi-fd-fraud/articleshow/86823574.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The only other woman on the list is K Lakshmi Raju of NACL Industries, who with a wealth of Rs 1,000 crore, is ranked 41st in the Telugu states.Interestingly, Datla is streets ahead of the promoters of Bharat Biotech, another Hyderabad-based vaccine maker, in the wealth sweepstakes. Bharat Biotech’s Dr Krishna Ella & family figure at the 22nd spot in the two states and on the 377th position all India with a combined wealth of Rs 4,100 crore.

According to Anas Rahman Junaid, managing director and chief researcher, Hurun India, the number of entrants on the rich list from Telangana and AP has grown from just under three people a decade ago to 70 now.

Thiruvanantapuram police stood second in the pan-India list. Out of 34 metropolitan cities of the country, crime rate of Rajkot city too was lower in 2020 as compared to average crime rates in these cities, said city police. However, the city registered the maximum number cases of violation of public notice during the nationwide lockdown among the 34 cities. “Rajkot police is using modern technology to control the crime rate like the eye way project, Surkshita app, e-cop application etc. The use of technology is also useful in detecting the offence once committed,” said Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agrawal. According to the NCRB records, the rating of law and order situation is given based on offences registered in major cities of the country from 2013 to 2015, 2019 and 2020. Total 88 cities were taken into the consideration in 2013, 54 in 2014 and 2015 and 2019 while 34 were counted in 2020. According to the data, Rajkot city was on number 34 out of the 88 cities in 2013, while it was on 15 in 2020 out of 34 cities for offences registered under IPC section 302 (murder). However, in 2020 India’s average rate in murder offences was 2.4, while Rajkot’s average rate was 2.1. In the ‘attempt to murder’ category, Rajkot city was on number 17 in 2013, while in 2020, city was on number 5. Rajkot’s rate in this offence is 1.7 in 2020 against India’s rate of 4.1. In a similar way, Rajkot’s rate is 9.9 in the offence under section 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) in 2020 against India’s average rate of 11.1. The city police claims that in offences like kidnapping, Rajkot is far better then the country’s average position. In 2020, Rajkot’s registered 3.4 rate in abduction cases against 8.2 of India’s average rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tech-helps-rajkot-cops-stay-ahead-of-criminals/articleshow/86818191.cms||---

Her family members alleged that she was being harassed by the warden. According to the police, the student hailed from Agra and had joined the institute two years ago. Rashmi’s roommate from Kolkata who used to go for studies with her friend, stays on the second floor. She went out around 5am and when she returned to her room at 8am, the door was locked. She knocked on it several times and then looked inside from the window to find the body hanging from the fan. She immediately informed the warden and other staff members. When contacted, assistant secretary and hospital administrator Swami Kalikrishnaananda, said, "The student was pursuing a three-year Diploma in General Nursing and Midwifery. She was a good and well behaved student, but for the past one year she was in depression after facing neurological issues. She was taking treatment in Agra. She had requested to shift her from the second to the ground floor and we did that because of her back pain.” He claimed that she had some family issues as well and her parents turned up to the hospital for the first time on Wednesday. “The principal had called the student’s home to talk to her parents as her performance was not satisfactory, but only her grandmother turned up, two months ago,” he said. He added that when she was asked to take her home as she was not looking good, she refused to do so on the plea that circumstances at her house were not favourable. On Sunday evening, she was talking to someone over the phone very loudly and the warden had warned her not to repeat it. After a few minutes, she again started shouting at someone on the phone, then the warden raised her voice and reprimanded her for flouting hostel rules. SP (city) MP Singh said the student had been staying in RK Mission’s girls' hostel and was in her second year. Her body has been sent for postmortem and the matter is being probed. No FIR had been registered till the filing of this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/nursing-student-found-hanging-in-mathuras-rk-mission-hostel/articleshow/86814666.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

This happened as scores of depositors, along with opposition political parties, took out a protest march to the house of secretary PV Haridas on Wednesday. Society governing body president Jijeesh M said that the secretary was suspended for trying to take files and documents from the society on the night of October 2. Depositors who had enrolled for the society’s chit scheme with a chit value of Rs 1 lakh with 50 monthly instalments of Rs 2,000 said that 386 investors of that scheme were yet to receive Rs 1.87 crore after its tenure ended in August. “The bank had seven other chit schemes and the total default amount would run into crores when they are also taken into account,” said Sibi Mechery, one of the depositors. He added that most investors were poor people who were awaiting the final amount to meet emergencies like building a house and even medical treatment. Sibi said that the chit schemes, which started in February 2017, had a duration of 50 months. It was extended by a few months following the pandemic and the term ended in August 2021. “But, when we approached the bank for payment, the society could not pay it back as the money was misappropriated. During the reconciliation meeting held last week, it was agreed that the secretary will register one of his properties for the purpose of paying back the investors. But, the secretary backed out at the last minute and went into hiding,” he said. It is learnt that cooperative department authorities, who have been carrying out an audit in the society over the past three days, found evidence of misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 1.65 crore. The society started the chit scheme in violation of directives issued by the department, it is learnt. The action council formed by investors will start a relay satyagraha in front of the society from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/investors-protest-secy-suspended/articleshow/86820686.cms||---

Roughly translating into “friends of wetlands”, those chosen will be empowered to take measures that involve removal of sewage and basic encroachments, apart from extending any other assistance that may be required, officials say. TimesViewWetlands play an important role in the ecosystem. Among other things, they lower pollution levels and raise groundwater tables. To get special wetland “mitras” who will actively monitor these vital waterbodies is a sensible step. The mitras should take their jobs seriously and prove that they are real friends of the wetlands.While the DSWA had begun the process to appoint the mitras in March, officials say they were awaiting selection through a committee that was formed recently. Of the 30 applications received, 27 were selected and their names sent to the Delhi government for approval, an official said. “Prospective wetland mitras have been shortlisted and the final list has been sent to the Delhi government for approval. Once cleared, they can begin protecting waterbodies near their villages or home. They will be assigned individual roles too,” the official said. In a notice that was taken out in March, the DSWA said anyone over the age of 12 years and wishing to revive or preserve waterbodies could apply to be a wetland mitra. Delhi government officials said the inspiration for the concept came from Kerala, where such a system has already been tried in the past. “The aim is to promote efforts from the locals willing to adopt johads and ponds for their preservation. Around 200 waterbodies across the capital are also planned to be revived in three phases, the last of which will end in December 2022,” said an official. The notice, however, stated that there would be no payments or honorarium from the Delhi government for these wetland mitras. “Wetland Mitra is conceived as an informal, voluntary and non-statutory network of concerned citizens to foster and promote community engagement in wetland conservation and management efforts. Any individual who can provide their time and services for the protection, management and beautification of their nearby wetlands can apply to become wetland mitras,” it stated. DSWA had on October 4 celebrated “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” by meeting with prospective wetland mitras to discuss ways to conserve waterbodies going ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/friends-indeed-27-wetland-mitras-to-help-conserve-revive-waterbodies-around-delhi/articleshow/86820696.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Kolkata||Plaque unveiled at Rajendralal Mitra’s ancestral home||Kolkata: A plaque in honour of Raja Rajendralal Mitra was unveiled by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) and Rotary International at his ancestral home at 143, Raja Rajendralal Mitra Road off Beleghata Main Road on Wednesday. Among the family members present at the event were Raja Randralal's great grandson Ranchhorlal Mitra and his great great grandson Dwaipayana Mitra. A multifaceted personality and a prominent figure of the Bengal Renaissance, Rajendralala Mitra was the first modern Indologist. The late 18th century mansion at the present address was constructed by his great-grandfather Pitambar Mitra, who held important positions at the royal courts of Ayodhya and Delhi. Rajendralal Mitra contributed to various fields, such as historiography, literature, publication, paleography/ numismatics, archaeology, architecture, antiquity, linguistics, indology, photography, geography, vernacularis and new system of cataloguing. He was the first Indian who initiated research on the ‘phonology and morphology’ of Indian languages and tried to establish ‘philology’ as a science. He was a noted antiquarian and played a substantial role in discovering and deciphering historical inscriptions, coins, and texts. He was also the first Indian president of Asiatic Society. The house where the plaque was unveiled has a mixed architectural style with both colonial and indigenous elements and is listed by KMC as a grade I heritage structure. It has a double storeyed courtyard and a three-arched thakurdalan. A typical Gothic element in the house is burtresses to support the external walls for structural stability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plaque-unveiled-at-rajendralal-mitras-ancestral-home/articleshow/86819374.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kochi||Kerala: Plea blames Nipah death on lack of ventilators||KOCHI: The high court has sought the views of the state government on the death of 12-year-old Mohammed Hashim at Kozhikode Medical College on a plea alleging that he died as a ventilator was not available even after 24 hours. Hashim, who had contracted Nipah virus, was admitted to the medical college with severe breathing problem, the petition filed by Kulathoor Jaisingh through advocate R Gopan said. In an earlier plea by the petitioner related to the death of a child in school due to snakebite, the government had told the court that sufficient ventilators are available at all the 10 government medical colleges. In the present plea, the petitioner has also alleged that even though there are two laboratories controlled by the central government in the state –– at Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha –– to detect Nipah, they were not fully functional and Hashim’s test had to be conducted at Pune, resulting in late detection of the virus. State government has failed to sanction amounts necessary for the two laboratories, according to the petition. A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly considered the plea and directed the principal secretary of health department to respond to the allegation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plea-blames-nipah-death-on-lack-of-ventilators/articleshow/86820710.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rules relaxed, Bengalis abroad look forward to mask-free festival||KOLKATA: Bengalis abroad have started enrolling themselves for a mask-free Durga Puja this year, as opposed to last year’s muted celebrations. Only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to attend after pre-registration. “This year the rules are relaxed, as only those fully vaccinated will participate after pre-registering. Our venue is the open-air amphitheatre at the Mission San Jose High School, Fremont. So we are back in the mask-free era,” quipped Gourav Roy, one of the Puja organizers from Prothoma-San Francisco Bay Area. The same goes for Swisspuja in Zurich. “Non-members, too, will be allowed once again. So, one expects around 200 to 300 people to congregate at a given point of time. Last year, around 30 (all masked) could participate. This time, masks aren’t required as vaccine records will be verified at the entry. Even cultural programmes will be held inside the venue,” said Kamalika Chakraborty, member, Swisspuja executive committee 2021. “I think we are luckier than those back home in Kolkata. Here in the UK, we can get as close to the idol as we want and celebrate with the community,” said London-based IT professional Prasenjit Bhattacharjee, who is a member of the Adda Sough Puja. Fellow organizer Nilotpal Mandal said, “We are recreating Kolkata’s Maddox Square at the Slough Cricket Club.” The pandal is 110 ft by 90 ft — to accommodate 750 devotees at a time. The entrance is called the “Gate of Joy” to support Bengal’s craftsmen who have suffered huge losses because of Covid. “For the first time in London, a woman priest will be performing the rituals this year,” said Kingshuk Bose of Bilete Bangali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rules-relaxed-bengalis-abroad-look-forward-to-mask-free-festival/articleshow/86819373.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Chandigarh||Punjab State Power Corporation Limited to end PPAs with 5 stations||PATIALA: A month after Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) disapproved of running power-purchase agreements with five generating stations, the PSPCL (Punjab State Power Corporation Limited) has sent out notices to terminate these PPAs. In September, the regulatory commission dismissed the PSPCL’s request to review its February decision and stuck to disapproving the PPAs, thus disallowing the procurement of electricity from DVC (Durgapur, Raghunathpur, and Bokaro), Pragati Gas (Bawana), and Meja Urja Nigam Private Limited (MUNPL), which aggregates to 885.10 megawatts. This was done on the grounds of high cost of purchase from these stations despite the availability of much cheaper power on the market. Even though the commission has given PSPCL the liberty to renegotiate viable rates with the plants and seek the commission’s approval, the PSPCL decided to stop buying power from the next month, keeping the option of negotiatiing with DVC on the end price and entering a fresh agreement. “Thereafter, both parties can approach PSERC for appropriate approvals in case a mutually acceptable agreement on price conducive to the procurement, consistent with the principle laid down in the order of September 6 and February 1, happens between them,” reads the notice to DVC. PSPCL had signed these long-term PPAs with some private generators without getting mandatory approval from the PSERC. The PPA with Kolkata’s Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) was signed in 2006 and the state power corporation started scheduling power from Durgapur, Raghunathpur, and Bokaro thermal-energy stations from 2012, 2016, and 2018, respectively. The PPA with Pragati Power, Himadri, was signed in 2008, and the power is being supplied since December 2011, while the deal with MUNPL, Allahabad, was executed in December 2010. PSPCL chairman and managing director A. Venu Parsad said: "We have issued the notices for termination of the PPA to these power generators." PSPCL director generation Paramjeet Singh said: "As the regulatory commission did not approve of these PPAs, we have initiated the process of termination by serving the notices and DVC has been sent one of these, while the others are also being served."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/month-after-psercs-dislike-pspcl-to-terminate-5-ppas/articleshow/86820709.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Delhi||Facing hurdles at IP Estate, SDMC explores option at Vasant Kunj for new HQ||NEW DELHI: After facing hurdles in constructing its headquarters on an 8.8-acre plot on Ring Road near IP Estate DTC bus depot, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has approached Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for utilisation of an alternative 7.8-acre plot at Vasant Kunj for the purpose. Recently, SDMC had submitted a proposal specifying space requirements for various purposes and the need for change in land use of the site. An official said while they were pursuing government agencies for obtaining clarity on the land at IP Estate, a proposal on the alternative site was being worked out simultaneously. “DDA was approached for change in land use of the Vasant Kunj site some time ago, but it has demanded clarification on the purpose/utilisation of the land. We have submitted a reply giving details of space required for staff, deliberative wing and other purposes. We are awaiting their reply,” said a senior SDMC official. At Vasant Kunj, around 2.5 acres of the 7.8-acre plot would be utilised for administrative offices, 2.5 acres for the deliberative wing and committee offices and the rest for property tax offices. The floor area ratio of each tower would be 300 or 30,000 square metres. “Though the site on Ring Road is perfect and centrally located, we do not have any clarity on the availability of space for developing the headquarters. The east-west corridor would be crossing the site underground and PWD has to take a call on changing the route. Our site is sandwiched among ongoing projects, which is why we are making alternative arrangements,” said the official. The official added, “At Vasant Kunj, there would be height restrictions as the area is close to the airport. The basement can’t be more than one floor as the location is rocky. As a result, a decision has been taken to expand vertically for which sufficient land is needed from DDA.” In 2017, SDMC had announced that its headquarters would come up on the “district park” on Ring Road. It had even signed an MoU with NBCC for carrying out construction work. However, it soon started facing hurdles, from change in land use by DDA to objections raised by other agencies due to ongoing projects, including PWD’s east-west corridor and Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transport System. Since 2012, SDMC’s deliberative and executive wings have been functioning from Civic Centre at JLN Marg shared with north corporation. Earlier, north corporation, which claims to own the property, had demanded rent from SDMC, but it recently quashed the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/facing-hurdles-at-ip-estate-sdmc-explores-option-at-vasant-kunj-for-new-hq/articleshow/86820712.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Hyderabad||Supreme Court lets Telangana withdraw Krishna plea; ball in Centre’s court, says state||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Telangana to withdraw its writ petition for resolution of Krishna water sharing issues with neighbour Andhra Pradesh. Telangana had requested for permission to withdraw the petition last year. Now, the ball was in the Union jal shakti ministry’s court, Telangana officials said. “It is a good beginning towards addressing the Krishna river water sharing issues. The jal shakti ministry can refer the matter to the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-II to finalise water sharing between the two Telugu states,” Telangana special chief secretary (irrigation) Rajat Kumar told TOI. Telangana withdrew the case after an assurance from Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to look into the row, Rajat Kumar said, adding that the ministry had even referred the matter for a legal opinion. Interestingly, Maharashtra and Karnataka while opposing the withdrawal of the case by Telangana, wanted the SC to hear their arguments, which was accepted by the court on Wednesday. “Unfortunately, AP was opposing withdrawal of our petition,” Rajat Kumar said. Telangana had filed the case in 2015 seeking a direction to the Centre for redistribution of water under the Inter-state River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act of 1956. A senior irrigation official said water allocation could not be done under section 89 of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, as it has only terms of reference to make project-wise allocation of total 811 tmcft of Krishna water. “It does not talk about redistribution of water to states. Secondly, AP has been diverting water to projects located outside the Krishna basin,” the official explained. Telangana government has been arguing that Krishna water should be redistributed between the two states under section 3 of ISRWD Act. It said a new tribunal should be constituted or the matter be referred to the existing KWDT-II, alleging that the existing water allocation was gross injustice to the state. Telangana has also been alleging that AP has been diverting the water outside the Krishna river basin by constructing new irrigation projects. For now, Telangana gets 299 tmcft out of 811 tmcft. AP’s share is 512 tmcft. Telangana has claimed that it should get at least 565 tmcft. The issue came up during the second apex council meeting held in October last year which was attended by Shekhawat and CMs of Telangana and AP, K Chandrasekhar Rao and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-lets-t-withdraw-krishna-plea-ball-in-centres-court-says-state/articleshow/86823670.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||In a first in India, Telangana develops smartphone-based e-voting app||HYDERABAD: The country’s first smartphone-based e-voting solution has been developed by the Telangana government and a dry run will be held in Khammam district soon. The software helps some voters, including senior citizens, persons with disabilities, those employed in notified essential services, polling personnel, and patients who can’t vote physically. Technical support for this project was provided by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC). The development has also been guided by an expert committee comprising professor Rajat Moona, director of IIT-Bhilai and technical advisor to the Election Commission, and professors from IIT-Bombay and IIT-Delhi. “The solution has been developed and tested. Its dry run in the form of a dummy election will be conducted in Khammam district with the registration on the application open from October 8 to 18, and dummy voting will be held on October 20. Though the initial scope was limited to a subset of citizens, the dry run is open for all citizens of the district,” an official statement of the IT department said. The initiative was taken by the Telangana State Election Commission which partnered with the IT department’s emerging technologies wing. Officials said the solution leverages artificial Intelligence for a three-stage authentication of voters. These include the name being matched with Aadhaar, liveness detection of individuals (to keep bots out), and image-matching with EPIC database (with records dating back 15 to 20 years). Blockchain (distributed ledger) technology has also been used to secure de-identified and encrypted votes so that they are maintained as immutable records. The smartphone application follows a minimalist design approach and supports both English and Telugu, and also has a detailed help section with tutorial videos and helpline number to aid citizens. The ‘TSEC e-Vote’ Android app is a security hardened application to prevent tampering and also binds a device ID and phone number to a specific citizen registration process such that only the same device can be used during voting. Principal secretary, IT department, Jayesh Ranjan said: “Artificial intelligence and blockchain are two of the most versatile emerging technologies that already empower many of our GovTech projects. We are glad to have supported TSEC in this initiative of building an e-Voting solution for our citizens, and especially those who may face challenges with physical voting with or without Covid-19 pandemic.” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-first-in-india-t-develops-smartphone-based-e-voting-app/articleshow/86823760.cms||Koride Mahesh

The area has been facing these issues for around 15 years after a number of hospitals and other commercial establishments like coaching classes and food joints started coming up there. Praying for stern directives to the respondents, petitioner Dhantoli Nagrik Mandal pointed out that in spite of ‘No Parking' and 'One Way Traffic' signboards installed at several places, many citizens are parking their vehicles and using bylanes in gross violation of prohibitory and regulatory measures. Petitioner’s counsels – Ashutosh Dharmadhikari and Ashwin Deshpande – pointed out that after the HC’s orders of July 3, 2019, the respondents, including the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and traffic police, have taken steps for prohibiting parking of vehicles at designated places in the area and regulating the movement of traffic. However, there is a problem in implementation of those prohibitory and regulatory measures, they said. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor then allowed the petitioner to prepare a draft scheme for regulation of traffic movement and submit it for consideration of the respondents. “We request the petitioner to form a team of its members, who are willing to volunteer their services to assist traffic police in its job to implement the prohibitory and regulatory measures. If any such team is formed, its intimation be given to commissioner of police (CP), in which case, he may consider issuance of necessary authorisation to the members of such team,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing by two weeks. Earlier, additional government pleader Shishir Uike requested for further time to seek instructions from CP, stating that some steps must have been taken by the traffic police in implementing these measures. “We grant two weeks to the respondents to submit their responses regarding the petitioner’s submission that there is no implementation of prohibitory and regulatory measures taken by NMC authorities,” the bench said. The HC was hearing a new PIL (No 52/2017) by Dhantoli citizens over several parking problems faced by the residents due to large number of hospitals cropped up in the area, which have allegedly gobbled up the parking space and opened canteen and other services at their basements in gross violation of norms. Fed up with the menace of commercial establishments in Dhantoli, which was once renowned as a locality of the “rich and famous”, the petitioner has prayed for their removal. According to the petition, the once posh area has now completely turned into a concrete jungle after many hospitals, coaching classes and food joints multiplied up in the area, primarily on account of blind permission granted by the NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-dhantoli-residents-to-form-panel-help-traffic-cops-over-parking-mess/articleshow/86847777.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Jharkhand BJP has so far, however, maintained silence since the incident took place last Sunday which triggered nationwide uproar. Sarangi tweeted the video of the incident and tagged UP police and the DGP seeking strict action, similar to what BJP MP from Pilbhit, Varun Gandhi did a day before. Talking to TOI, Sarangi said, “I stick to my stand on this issue and demand quick and strict punishment for the culprits. This is something which shouldn’t have taken place. And I think even UP CM Yogi Adityanathji has assured thorough probe.” On the opposition parties, mainly the Congress, making attempts to visit the tension-hit zone, Sarangi said that it has become a fashion for undertaking selective visits. “...I request Rahul and Priyanka Gandhiji to also make similar visits to Jharkhand or the states ruled by Congress or their coalition governments rather than cherry picking people’s issues,” he said. On Tuesday, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, who is currently in police custody, released a footage of the killings in Lakhimpur Kheri. The car was allegedly linked to Union minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra Teni. His son Ashish is accused of driving the car.

For many in Jharkhand hoping to go pandal-hopping this Durga Puja after Covid robbed them of the opportunity last year, the state government restrictions on entry of devotees came as a disappointment. But with hotels across the state welcoming visitors, it has offered a window of opportunity for some to make the most of the festival period. Thanks to the ban, prominent getaway destinations across Jharkhand are gearing up for a heavy rush during Durga Puja, scheduled next week. Tourist destinations like Netarhat and Betla, already seeing an uptick in visitors in recent months, are ready for more business in the coming days. “We could not visit the pandals last year, neither could we go on a holiday due to the travel restrictions and quarantine protocols. But this year, after the government once again banned the entry of devotees into the pandals, I decided to take my family out for a vacation in Betla and Netarhat,” said Lalpur resident Arindam Moitra. He was lucky to have got his bookings done three weeks in advance unlike Sumit Das of Tharpakhna. “A couple of days back I tried to book rooms at the Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC) hotel in Netarhat. But there are no rooms available,” said Das who is now planning to take his family on a short trip to Mandarmani in West Bengal. “Bookings in our hotels open 90 days in advance. In 2020, the hotels were closed due to the pandemic. But this year, our hotels in Betla and Netarhat have 100% occupancy for the entire Durga Puja period,” JTDC general manager Alok Prasad told TOI on Wednesday. “Even our hotel in Patratu is completely occupied next week,” he said. “This year, Netarhat has witnessed good number of visitors even during the lean season as all the rooms were fully occupied during weekends,” Prasad added. A JTDC official said while Betla and Netarhat are packed, lesser known destinations such as Itkhori and Tenughat are expected to witness a surge in bookings after Navratri ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-ban-on-pandal-entry-of-devotees-a-boon-for-states-tourist-destinations/articleshow/86820252.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He said that the extremists were threatening Rampal for levy for the past several days but the latter did not inform the police. Police have seized empty cartridges and posters from the spot. Alam said, “We have registered a case in connection with the incident. Raids were carried out in the area to nab the miscreants.” Sources said that Rampal is engaged is road construction work. The extremists have been demanding levy and had recently been sending frequent messages to him over Whatsapp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/extremists-open-fire-in-harra-village/articleshow/86820377.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: State assembly to host youth parliament||RANCHI: Jharkhand assembly with the support of Delhi-based non-profit organisation PRS Legislative Research, will host the first youth parliament on October 30-31 in the new assembly building. The idea is to create awareness about legislative processes among youth and give them an opportunity to gain hands-on experience through a mock session of the assembly. The assembly secretariat has made elaborate arrangements for the youth parliament, a first of its kind in its 21-year-old history. Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto, minister Mithilesh Thakur, Jharkhand assembly secretary Mahendra Prasad and legislative expert from PRS, Chakshu Rai, addressed media here on Wednesday to share the details of the selection process and event plan. Mahto said the future leaders are shaped at an young age and unless there is an exposure to the system which governs the people, there remains a disconnect. “I am inspired by young blood like Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg who have raised their voice at an young age. Even we have bright children like them in Jharkhand but there is a need to provide them with a stage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-assembly-to-host-youth-parliament/articleshow/86820348.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Ranchi: Tri-weekly festive special train between Hatia and Durg stations||RANCHI: The Ranchi railway division of the South Eastern Railways on Wednesday announced to run a tri-weekly festive special train connecting Hatia and Durg railway stations to clear the festive rush. In a statement, the division said the train will make nine trips between October 7 and November 4 through Rourkela, Jharsuguda, Raigarh and Bilaspur stations. However, Ranchi’s divisional railway manager Pradeep Kumar Gupta said the division did not have information on whether any other festive special trains will be operated in coming days. While three express trains are currently operating between Hatia and Howrah stations, the division hinted that there was no plan to operate festival specials on the route during Durga Puja. No festive specials have been announced for Bihar yet. Until 2019, SER ran bi-weekly festive special trains from Hatia to Santragachi station to clear the festive rush. Last year, SER had resumed the services of three regular trains connecting Ranchi and Howrah stations and two trains connecting Ranchi and Patna ahead of Durga Puja by terming them as festive special trains. “While no festive special trains have been announced by the railways so far, there is no effort to reinstate the regular trains. Even the passenger trains are being converted into specials and their fares are being hiked exorbitantly,” Prem Kataruka, secretary of Jharkhand Passenger Association said. “Thousands of people travel to their homes from Ranchi and return to their homes here during the festive season. The fares are exorbitant, sometimes as high as 1.5 times. The Indian Railways should take cognizance of the economic distress the people are in and regularise the fares,” Kataruka said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tri-weekly-festive-spl-train-between-hatia-durg-stns/articleshow/86819992.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Congress workers heads to violence-torn Lakhimpur Kheri||RANCHI:: Upping the ante against the BJP-led government in Uttar Pradesh, several workers from Jharkhand Congress on Wednesday left for violence-torn Lakhimpur Kheri to join to protest against the arrest of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and express condolences to the kin of the deceased farmers. The Opposition BJP in the state, on the other hand, snubbed the ruling Congress for shedding crocodile tears for farmers at a time when many annadatas in Jharkhand are struggling for basic resources to pursue farming and are awaiting payments in lieu of last year’s paddy procurement. Party’s general secretary Aditya Sahu said, “Congress is resorting to political tourism in UP solely to further its agenda to stoke tension there in the name of farmers .” Around 6pm, at least 250 Congress workers, including two ministers of the Hemant Soren cabinet — Banna Gupta (health) and Badal Patralekh (agriculture) — several MLAs and state Congress president Rajesh Thakur left for Lakhimpur Kheri by road. Violence broke out in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday (October 3) after four farmers were mowed down by a speeding car allegedly linked to Union minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra “Teni”. A total of eight persons, including a few BJP workers had died in the clash thereafter. Mishra’s son, Ashish, was accused of driving the car though he and his father have denied the allegations. None of them have been arrested so far, which the Congress and other opposition parties have already questioned. Talking to TOI, Thakur said, “The Lakhimpur Kheri violence exposed the real face of the BJP government in the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh towards the farmers. But by detaining and arresting members of the Congress who wanted to meet the kin of the deceased farmers, the saffron camp has crossed all limits of violating constitutional norms.” “Since the past 48 hours, our leader Priyanaka Gandhi is in custody, while Chattisgarh CM Bhupesh Bhagel was not allowed to move out of Lucknow airport where he landed. This shows how rattled the BJP government is in UP. Hence, Jharkhand Congress has now decided to head to UP in solidarity with farmers.” Criticizing BJP’s barb against Congress leaders for trying to fan tension in UP by visiting Lakhimpur Kheri as political opportunism, Poriyahat MLA Pradeep Yadav, who is part of the UP-bound team, said, “We don’t see it as any political opportunity. It is in the DNA of BJP. Congress has been working for the people since ages and when such violence happens, it is only natural for leaders to visit the families to express solidarity. Any movement shapes up in a phased manner, and the ongoing farmers’ movement has been there for the past 10 months against the three farm laws. We will stand by the farmers through thick and thin.” Party spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said the state team will first reach Lucknow on Thursday morning and from there will head to Lakhimpur Kheri. Rakesh Sinha, another party spokesperson, added, “The decision for UP march was taken following directives from the party high command.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-cong-heads-to-violence-torn-lakhimpur-kheri/articleshow/86819968.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Sindhi has been on the run for last 18 days after a 24-year-old girl filed a case of rape against Ashok Jain, a chartered accountant and Raju Bhatt. The police said that Sindhi’s testimony is also key to their case. “Initially, our focus was on arresting the rape accused. We managed to nab Bhatt while the search for Jain is still on. But our focus is also on nabbing Sindhi though he isn’t an accused in this case. His statement will reveal much more details as he is a friend of the girl,” a police official said. Sindhi is already wanted in a prohibition case. “We got clues about his whereabouts but before our team reaches there, he changes his location. We are confident of tracking down Sindhi and Jain soon,” the police added. Meanwhile, former trustee of Pavagadh Temple Raju Bhatt was sent to judicial custody on Wednesday morning. The investigators produced Bhatt in the judicial magistrate’s court on Wednesday as his extended remand period too ended. As police did not seek further custody of Bhatt, the court ordered to send Bhatt to Vadodara Central Jail. After his arrest, Bhatt was remanded to police custody for three days which was later extended by the court to three more days.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: JMM, BJP lock horns over inauguration of PSA oxygen plants||RANCHI: The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and state BJP leaders are locked in war of words over inauguration of 38 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants constructed through PM cares (fund) in the state. While the BJP accused the state government of taking credit for work done by the BJP government at the Centre, JMM said that public health is a state subject and the state government is competent enough to take appropriate decisions for the people. The war of words between the BJP and the JMM started after several BJP leaders, including Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and Kanke MLA Samri Lal, decided to boycott the event organised on RIMS campus on Wednesday for inauguration of PSA plants, a day ahead of the nationwide inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Issuing a statement, Seth said that inauguration of all PSA plants which have been constructed through PM-Cares fund a day before the PM’s programme is disrespecting Modi and they will keep away from the event in protest. “Chief minister Hemant Soren in order to gain a few brownie points and to disrespect PM Narendra Modi has decided to inaugurate the PSA plants which have been constructed through PM-Cares fund. The timing of the inauguration was scheduled a day before its nationwide launch to take credit on work done by our government at the Centre,” said Seth. Reacting to the allegations, JMM said that PSA plant is an essential and emergency requirement and slammed the BJP for “always wanting to market things which is outside their ambit”. Talking to TOI, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said: “First and foremost, public health is a state subject and the state government has all the rights to take a decision on that issue. Oxygen plant is an emergency service... why does BJP wants to hold an event to provide oxygen to patients? If an essential service is ready, it should be immediately started without wasting any time.” Questioning the validity of BJP’s accusation, Bhattacharya added that the money collected in PM-cares isn’t someone’s individual property and BJP should stop treating it in that manner. “PM-Cares fund is public money and for inaugurating a service made out of public money that too for welfare of patients I don’t think one needs to check for an auspicious day. If someone requires oxygen today, will he/ she wait for PM Modi to inaugurate it on a specific day?” said Bhattacharya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate 35 PSA oxygen plants established under the PM cares fund across 35 states and union territories in an event to be held at AIIMS Rishikesh in Uttarakhand on Thursday. With this, all districts of the country will have commissioned PSA oxygen plants, the PMO said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-bjp-lock-horns-over-inauguration-of-psa-oxygen-plants/articleshow/86820125.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: State matches Delhi-sponsored 38 PSA plants with 34 of its own||RANCHI: State health minister Banna Gupta on Wednesday said he is proud of his department and healthcare workers. "Many say that ‘swastha vibagh nahi sudharega’, meaning the health department can never improve, but today I am proud while I thank all healthcare workers of the state health department for their dedicated service as we have fought two waves of Covid-19 successfully," said Banna while addressing the gathering at Rims as he inaugrated PSA oxygen plants of different state hospitals across various districts. After inaugurating PSA plants which have been funded by the PM-Cares Fund, Banna thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the Centre has provided funds to set up 38 PSA plants while the state government has also contributed to establishing 34 plants taking the total number to 72. “I feel proud for my healthcare workers when I hear stories that when relatives had abandoned Covid patients, our healthcare workers had ensured that they received proper treatment. I would also like to attract attention to a fact that when 70% of the private sector had closed their ‘shops’ for patients, it was our state-run healthcare system which showed the way and ensured that people received treatment,” added Banna. Apart from the inauguration of PSA plants, earlier in the day, chief minister Hemant Soren along with Banna reached the microbiology department and inaugrated COBAS 6800 machine which can test more than 1,200 samples of Covid-19 in three hours. “We have come a long way. When Covid-19 struck, we did not have a single RT-PCR lab in state. From there to adding up 200 Truenat machines, eight RT-PCR labs, and now COBAS machines we have come a long way,” added Banna. Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh, who also addressed the event, said the state government is committed to providing the best healthcare facilities and they are working on strengthening infrastructure as well as other requirements at all of their district hospital to tertiary care centres. “We have started working on three new district hospital buildings at Khunti, Lohardaga and Seraikela. Apart from that, a proposal is in the final stages to strengthen services of OPD as well as IPD at Rims and MGM Jamshedpur,”Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-matches-delhi-sponsored-38-psa-plants-with-34-of-its-own/articleshow/86820091.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||India||Activists’ ‘silence’ on J&K civilian killings questioned||NEW DELHI: Security agencies have questioned the silence of human rights activists and groups on the killing of three innocent civilians in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, with senior officers asking if police action against terrorists and overground workers alone counts as “human rights violations” for them. Makhan Lal Bindroo, a known chemist belonging to the minority Kashmiri Pandit community, was killed on Tuesday by The Resistance Front (TRF). Around the same time, Mohd Shafi Lone, a Kashmiri from Naidkhai, and Virender Paswan, a labourer from Bhagalpur in Bihar and residing at Alamgiri Bazar, were also killed, with TRF later claiming responsibility for them. J&K police and central agencies believe TRF is only a front for LeT, rebranded to project Pakistan-sponsored terror as an “indigenous” movement by local Kashmiris. The absence of any public statement by either domestic NGOs and ‘experts’ or international watchdogs, condemning the two dozen civilian fatalities inflicted by terrorists in J&K till September this year and Tuesday’s killing of three civilians, is being seen in the context of UNHRC chief Michelle Bachelet recently criticising the frequent use of UAPA, particularly in J&K, temporary communication blackouts and the high number of detentions. Questioning the “deathly silence”, a top officer of the central security establishment said: “Despite planned, cold-blooded killings of three civilians in a span of one hour, no global outburst has emerged decrying human rights violations in Kashmir. The very same, so-called Kashmir sympathisers, particularly in Britain, Europe, the US and the Gulf, unleash a torrent of social media posts following any action by the Indian security forces against Pakistan- based terror forces. After three killings, they all have maintained a deathly silence. Within India too, those who are constantly pained over the killing of terrorists in Kashmir have found no reason to speak up if locals and non-locals are killed by terrorists.” A J&K police official said international outrage on Kashmir follows a pattern. “It is selective and subjective. Brutal killings by terrorists year after year are ignored. These human rights champions are blind to the terror ecosystem where religion is used as a tool to indoctrinate vulnerable youth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/activists-silence-on-jk-civilian-killings-questioned/articleshow/86826587.cms||---
---||India||Lakhimpur: BJP says Rahul trying to fan unrest and Congress seeking mileage||NEW DELHI: Alleging the Gandhi family is using the Lakhimpur Kheri incident as an opportunity to derive political mileage as it has been facing questions from party leaders, BJP on Wednesday accused Rahul Gandhi of trying to fan unrest over the incident that resulted in eight deaths. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra hit back at the Congress leader over his remarks that “dictatorship prevails in the country” and said “irresponsibility” has become Rahul’s second name. “The Congress has been trying everything to provoke people to cause violence,” Patra said and asked the leader to desist from attempts aimed at getting votes from the crisis. Patra referred to the recent baton charge on farmers by police at Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, where the Congress is in office, and asked if Rahul Gandhi ever spoke to the state chief minister regarding this. “Rahul Gandhi has been ‘selective’ on farmers as to why is not visiting the farmers who were assaulted by police in Hanumangarh in Rajasthan when they were holding demonstrations seeking purchase of paddy crop?” he questioned. Patra also took a swipe at Rahul, saying he had never faced protests from BJP workers for his press conferences, while Congress members threw tomatoes and protested outside dissident leader Kapil Sibal’s residence for his critical comments about the party’s functioning. “There is democracy in the country and that is why you are holding the press conference,” he said and added, “of course there is democracy in the country... Rahul Gandhi makes derogatory remarks against BJP leaders and has been abusive towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” Noting that farmer leaders and the local administration coordinated to deal with the crisis, Patra said an “impartial probe” is on into the violence and people should not give irresponsible statements that may obstruct justice. He alleged that the Gandhi family had nothing to do with either farmers or any other section of society. “They are not even concerned about the Congress. All they want is that their fortunes should not be scuttled,” Patra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakhimpur-bjp-says-rahul-trying-to-fan-unrest-and-congress-seeking-mileage/articleshow/86826848.cms||---
---||Goa||Child rights panel urges kids to come forward with their issues||PANAJI: The Goa State Commission for Protection of Child Rights is working to make children more aware about their basic rights after it found that they hardly ever write or approach them with their problems. The commission, this year, has received only one complaint directly from a child. The rest have been sent in mostly by parents. Chairperson of the commission Peter Borges while speaking at a round table session on child online protection and safety in Margao, on Tuesday, said that there is a need to make children aware of their basic rights, including those under the UN Convention on Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and make them party to decisions instead of treating them as subjects who must follow commands. “Children can send us complaints related to child abuse, excess fees charged by schools, non-issuance of receipts, extra fees taken in cash, poor toilet facilities, no toilet facilities for girls, no clean water and other issues,” Borges said, while encouraging parents not to inculcate fear in children who try to complain about abuse online. He told TOI that the team is working to make the commission more child-friendly and approachable so that children approach them in case of any violations. A child-friendly version of the rights of children is being put together and developed in the form of a booklet. “Our focus is to give them a platform to get their voices heard,” Borges said. Children’s most basic rights revolve around four aspects. Survival, which includes the right to life, good food, water, and to grow up healthy. Development, which is right to education and time to relax and play. Participation, right to say how they feel, be listened to and taken seriously and finally, protection — right to be treated well and not be hurt by anyone. The commission will be introducing the topic on child rights in all talukas beginning with sessions for heads of schools on October 9, at Ponda. The commission monitors the implementation of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection ) Act, 2015, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and ensures that children’s rights enshrined in the Constitution of India/UNCRC are protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/child-rights-panel-urges-kids-to-come-forward-with-their-issues/articleshow/86821123.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa: Group of citizens requests CM to constitute special cell to probe fraudulent sale and change of land ownership||PANAJI: Stating that citizens cannot be expected to check property records everyday like one checks diabetes or blood pressure, a group of citizens under the banner ‘Citizens for Democracy’ have requested the chief minister to constitute a special cell under the secretary revenue to investigate fraudulent sale and change of land ownership, where people can register such complaints. “ ...the rate at which names of original owners in the land records forms I and XIV are getting replaced by persons predominantly reported to be from Delhi region either through purchase or frauds,” the group stated in a letter to chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday. The group handed over two cases to the CM to test and find out weak spots in administration that lead to flagrant violation of law in Cuncolim village. The group asked for investigation within seven days and for launching of criminal proceedings of cheating and fraud against those involved. “Although forms I and XIV do not have much value to prove ownership of properties, government authorities are allowing development of such properties without insisting on proof of ownership,” stated the group comprising Elvis Gomes, Pradeep Padgaonkar, Siddharth Karapurkar, Ramiro Mascarenhas, Rodney Almeida and Edwin Vaz. The group said that the rate at which land in Goa was getting sold with the connivance of both legal as well as illegal mechanisms was alarming, and alleged that “it would not have been possible without active backing of the government machinery”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/constitute-spl-cell-to-look-into-land-frauds/articleshow/86821127.cms||---
---||India||Democracy has been supplanted by dictatorship: Rahul Gandhi||NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said democracy in India has been supplanted by dictatorship with BJP and RSS capturing institutions, as he questioned the decision of the UP government to stop party members from visiting the kin of the Lakhimpur Kheri farmers crushed allegedly by the SUV of junior home minister Ajay Mishra’s son. Addressing a press conference before leaving for Lucknow, Rahul said that no action has yet been taken against the minister and his son. He said while Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Lucknow on Tuesday, he chose not to go to the scene of the incident. Drawing a link between the Hathras rape-murder, Unnao rape and Kheri, Rahul said, “In Unnao, there was rape by MLA. Here it is a minister. This is new kind of politics in UP. Criminals can do anything, rape or murder. Those who commit crime are free, while the victims and those who speak for them, go to jail.” “The opposition’s job is to build pressure, only then action is taken. The government does not want us to raise the issue in Kheri, so that people can go scot-free. Had we not gone to Hathras, the accused would have gone scot-free. Same in Unnao rape,” he said. He said the government does not understand the power of farmers and is instigating them out of sheer arrogance, which “is a bad idea”. “Farmers across the country are being victimised — first by land acquisition amendment and now by three farm laws. “The rights of farmers are being snatched and that is why the farmers are protesting,” he said. Saying that dictatorship has replaced democracy, Rahul said Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel was stopped from entering Lucknow on the pretext of Section 144 though he was alone, and “we are being told we too can’t go”. Rahul said that if the government did not change its ways, it will lead to an explosion that one cannot imagine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/democracy-has-been-supplanted-by-dictatorship-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/86826988.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Goa||Goa: Oppn slams govt for gang violence in Calangute||PANAJI: Criticising the state government for the violent clash at Calangute between two rival gangs, the opposition said that the BJP-led government has ruined Goa’s reputation completely by allowing anti-social elements to run riot in the state. Congress demanded that governor P S Sreedharan Pillai step in, while Goa Forward Party demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant step down. The two parties were reacting to clashes between two gangs near the Calangute market which left four people injured, one grievously. The gang violence revived memories of the shootout between two gangs in Santa Cruz, where one gang member was shot dead. “Under the BJP, Goa’s reputation of being great, glorious and golden has been destroyed,” said former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai. “This government’s tenure has seen the complete collapse of law and order in the state, making Goa all about gangs, guns and goriness.” Congress was also quick to react and blame Sawant for the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. “How low will you allow law and order to stoop, chief minister?” asked state Congress president Girish Chodankar. “There’s no fear in the minds of criminals, due to which gangsters are having a field day. The gang war at Calangute mirrors the inefficiency of BJP and the government of Goa.” Goa police has launched a manhunt to nab those involved in the clash. A history-sheeter from Parra, Tarzan, was arrested by Calangute police. A team of police personnel led by PI Nolasco Raposo rushed to the scene and prevented the fight from escalating “It’s high time governor Pillai takes over the administration,” said Chodankar, while Sardesai said that Goans and their families seek safety and security in Goa, and if the present government cannot provide it, it should step down. “If they can’t provide (security), they must leave,” said Sardesai. “We Goans must act now to end this Pramod Sawant-nonsense called government of Goa that accords no value to our lives or property.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-slams-govt-for-gang-violence-in-calangute/articleshow/86821301.cms||---

A few weeks ago, villagers had stopped the erection of the tower, urging the telecom company’s officials to produce documentation for the same. Colva sarpanch Johnson Coelho said that after the stop-work notice was issued two weeks ago, the panchayat office was provided with an incomplete set of documents wherein the location of the tower was not mentioned. On Wednesday, when the villagers gathered at the site again to stop the work, Colva police in-charge Tukaram Chavan said that they had received orders from the deputy collector’s office to provide protection for the work. The villagers were shown the order and requested to disperse. The villagers, led by Coelho, then approached deputy collector Jyoti Kumari, who asked them to get the permissions revoked from PWD. Coelho said the panchayat office is unaware of any such permission granted since it has been processed through a single-window system. He said that the subject of the telecom tower was to be discussed at a special gram sabha meet to be held on October 10 and an inspection was scheduled for October 11. As per the Goa Telecom Infrastructure Policy 2020, panchayat permission is not required to install mobile towers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-restarts-on-colva-cell-tower-under-police-eye/articleshow/86821489.cms||---

But many journalists are now trying to cross-question us to make us say that the farmers beat him to death. That did not happen,” Raman’s brother Pawan told TOI. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had earlier said that Kashyap would be counted among the farmer “martyrs”. “My brother was a journalist but we are a family of farmers. What Tikait said was right,” Pawan said. “I have not received the postmortem report … I was told that there’s a procedure to attach our complaint to another FIR that has already been lodged. The FIR by farmers is the one with which ours is being attached.” Earlier in the day, a video with Pawan’s allegations against the media had been shared widely. “They are trying to put words in our mouths. That farmers beat him up. We said that didn’t happen. But the politics over this doesn’t end,” he says in the video. “One journalist came and said the autopsy report states he died of injuries from being beaten up with sticks. I ended up getting into an argument with him. He said had I not been the journalist’s brother, he would not have spoken with the civility he had … The autopsy report is not here but they’re making up stories. I was there at the mortuary. I saw his injuries. He had not been beaten up with sticks.” When asked how the theory came about, Pawan says, “There was a WhatsApp forward, on the basis of which I was being asked these questions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/media-pressuring-us-to-say-farmers-killed-journo-kin/articleshow/86827142.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||‘Patch-up work in guise of restoration harmful to KA’||Panaji: A modern architecture structure like Kala Academy requires regular maintenance cycles. Patching things up in the name of repairs and restoration is not the solution. Instead, productive measures are required, said Buland Shukla, an acoustical consultant hired by the public works department for the ongoing repair works at the Kala Academy. “Avoiding layering and patchwork solutions is the key. One must treat the cause, not just the symptom, when applying a solution,” he said. The Charles Correa Foundation had reached out to the consultant, Techton Buildcon Pvt Ltd, to make a presentation through a virtual public hearing with Shukla to discuss the ongoing work. He pointed out that there should be access to documents and data, especially when there are “new interventions” that come with repair works. “If that’s not possible, then we should gather as much information to ensure that there are no mistakes being made in such a massive scale restoration because they will have an impact for decades to come. Not just the acoustical data, but the information on the field must be available and individual discussions must be held in detail with a set of experts,” he said. Shukla cited the example of repair works during the first International Film Festival of India in Goa in 2004, wherein the intervention led to many changes, thus affecting the acoustics of the building. CCF director Nondita Correa pointed out how the waterproofing of the building was done over the years wherein tonnes of layers were added, creating a deadload. She further added that projects such as the KA need to have timelines, transparency and a record of what was done at what stage. “Everything has its own lifecycle which needs to be properly tabulated so that we have a proper plan for maintenance. Such a report can project the next 10 years of the building’s health and create an estimate for that. This can help save buildings of modern architecture,” she said. The issue of the introduction of wall art at the Kala Academy was also raised at the virtual meet by Poonam Varma Mascarenhas, steering committee member of ICOMOS. She pointed out that the introduction of Kavi art and Mario Miranda murals may interfere with the existing acoustics of the building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/patch-up-work-in-guise-of-restoration-harmful-to-ka/articleshow/86821613.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityThe average PM 2.5 value is 285 micrograms per cubic metre during this period. Officials said this is the only period that has been put in the ‘severe’ range (when the PM 2.5 concentration is more than 250 micrograms per cubic metre). “The period witnesses severe pollution mainly due to a rise in stubble burning and Diwali celebrations,” according to an official of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). Dec 16 to 31 is second most polluted fortnight in winter The second most polluted fortnight of this season is December 16 to 31 with an average PM 2.5 level of 218 micrograms per cubic metre, according to this report. “Meteorological conditions are one of the most important factors through the entire winter season but the average PM2.5 crosses the 200-mark in the second half of December because of farm fires, festivals and marriage season,” said the official. Delhi’s air quality remains in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ categories during the beginning (October 1-15) and end (February 16-28) of the winter season. However, it remains in the ‘very poor’ category in the other fortnights. The air quality is considered ‘moderate’ to ‘very poor’ when PM 2.5 is between 61 and 120 micrograms per cubic metre. It is considered to be ‘very poor’ when the PM 2.5 level is between 121 and 250 micrograms per cubic metres. “Based on this analysis, all the agencies will intensify their actions to control pollution. We have come up with the Delhi Winter Action Plan, listing 10 points to tackle this,” said a senior official of the environment department. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “Smog episodes intensify in two distinct phases during winter — early November and end December— January. Low temperature, inversion, calm wind and atmospheric changes trap air and pollution. The pollution concentration starts to build up from mid-October. Farm fires, Diwali firecrackers and an increase in traffic intensity around festivals contribute to the November smog. In subsequent phases, more intense winter conditions create opportunities for more severe smog episodes.” She said the winter conditions cannot change but the authorities can bring down the pollution levels. “If the authorities take round-the-year action with a systemic approach, develop infrastructure and implement strategies, overall pollution can be reduced and the levels sustained. However, during extreme pollution episodes, immediate emergency measures are needed to ensure that pollution levels do not worsen,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dec-16-to-31-is-second-most-polluted-fortnight-in-winter/articleshow/86822590.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||India||Editors Guild seeks court-led probe into death of journalist in UP||New Delhi: The death of TV journalist Raman Kashyap during the Lakhimpur Kheri violence is shocking and raises many questions, the Editors Guild of India (EGI) said while demanding a separate court-led special investigation to ascertain the circumstances under which Kashyap died. In a statement on Tuesday, the Guild said there were “competing versions” in the media about the conditions under which Kashyap died, with one claiming that he died of bullet wounds. Expressing its shock at the death of Kashyap, the EGI said, he was reporting on the events of the day when the “horrific incident” of the convoy running through protesting farmers took place, “killing some of them”. “In what is clearly a terror attack meant to spread fear amongst the farmers, the killing of Kashyap raises many questions. There are competing versions about Kashyap’s death including a version that claims he died of bullet wounds,” the Guild said in a sharply worded statement. It also said an independent inquiry is, therefore, needed to establish the cause of the TV journalist’s death. “The EGI is concerned about the varying versions of the incident in different sections of the media. It is imperative for the media to report the facts and not versions,” it said.

The board will consist of 13 members representing non-resident Tamils and the government to implement and administer various welfare programmes. The Tamil Nadu Non-Resident Tamils’ Welfare Act was enacted by the DMK government led by M Karunanidhi on March 1, 2011, but the board was not set up as per the provisions of the Act. “Wherever Tamils live, Tamil Nadu is their mother land. It is the duty of Tamil Nadu to not only love them but also protect them,” chief minister M K Stalin said. He also announced the constitution of Tamil Nadu Non-Resident Tamils’ Welfare Fund with an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore. Since Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, about seven lakh Tamils have returned to the state and many lost their jobs. The government will extend loans to them with a maximum subsidy of Rs 2.5 lakh for promoting entrepreneurship. Currently, home and public departments, commissionerate of rehabilitation and welfare of non-resident Tamils and overseas manpower corporation limited are meeting the requirements of non-resident Tamils. The state government is keen to club various services under one agency. Stalin said the government would create a database of NRTs and life and health insurance schemes would be extended to those registered with the board. In the event of death of NRTs of low income group, the children will get financial assistance for education and marriage. The chief minister said the government would allocate Rs 20 crore for the welfare of non-resident Tamils, including Rs 6.4 crore for the board and welfare fund, Rs 8.1 crore for welfare schemes, and Rs 5.5 crore for cultural exchanges. Orientation programmes will be extended to those who emigrate for education and employment from Ramanathapuram, Pudukottai, Kanyakumari, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Sivaganga and Villupuram districts, in addition to Chennai. “Toll-free helpline, web portal and a mobile application will be developed for non-resident Tamils to get assistance,” Stalin said. A legal helpdesk will be set up exclusively for the NRTs. Since many non-resident Tamils are keen on investing their savings in Tamil Nadu, the state government will facilitate signing of memorandum of understanding to deposit their funds in government agencies. “A scheme - My Village - will be launched to help non-resident Tamils improve infrastructure in their native, and meet the basic needs such as education and healthcare. An invite will be extended to the NRTs to build schools, hospitals and libraries,” the chief minister said. In a bid to encourage children of those staying abroad to learn Tamil, the state government will impart Tamil teaching through Tamil Virtual Academy. Incentives will be provided to the institutions teaching Tamil and training to teachers. Stalin said that ‘Day of Non-Resident Tamils’ will be celebrated every year on January 12 in collaboration with Tamil associations abroad to unite Tamils in different countries and recognize their contributions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/decade-on-tamil-nadu-govt-sets-up-welfare-board-for-non-resident-tamils/articleshow/86827172.cms||---

Images of damage to the deck and foundation of the bridge, clicked and uploaded on social media by a local, have gone viral. Agonda sarpanch Badal Naikgaonkar told TOI a tender for demolition and construction of a new bridge has already been awarded to a contractor, who has in turn been awaiting the work order. Naikgaonkar further said that he has already directed the panchayat secretary to write a letter to the authorities concerned to do a structural audit on the stability of the existing bridge. “If the authorities certify that the bridge can be used, it’s fine. Otherwise we will have to close the bridge forthwith for vehicles and pedestrians ,” he said. Further, he said that since the condition of the bridge has already been brought to the notice of the PWD, if any untoward incident happens, the departmwwill be responsible for it. The narrow bridge, which can just about accomodate a small car, is used by locals as well as tourists to cross the Agonda river. In 2017 when former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had visited the area, he had said that it is a shame that such a small public utility project, which might not cost more than Rs 60 lakh, has remained pending. Unfortunately for the locals, the ‘small project” continues to be igonored, this despite its condition being brought to the notice of the government and the public works department (PWD). Meanwhile, when asked about the status of the file pertaining to the construction of the new bridge, Canacona MLA and deputy speaker Isidore Fernandes said that the tender has alreadyy been awarded to M/S Puthire Construction and that the firm is just awaiting the work order to commence work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bridge-at-agonda-on-verge-of-collapse/articleshow/86821709.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sources at the Tikunia police station, where two FIRs have been lodged on Sunday’s killings, said four suspects have been detained. “They are being questioned,” the source added. The source did not, however, say which FIR the suspects have been rounded up for or the reason they were picked up. A local intelligence officer told TOI, “The priority is to ensure law and order first. The probe is taking some time.” It was why, police said, no arrest was made four days since the violence. “We’re verifying videos to make sure they’re not doctored, recording statements of cops on duty there that day and gathering evidence. Arrests will be made after we have sufficient proof. In one FIR (the one filed by a member of the minister’s convoy), no one has been named. So, we need to determine who may be the accused,” ADG SN Sabat told TOI. Kheri SP Vijay Dhull said, “We’ll only make an arrest after verifying the evidence that we have. Questioning is on. Both parties are levelling allegations against each other, so we have to corroborate all the proof that we have.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/4-days-2-firs-no-arrest-in-lakhimpur-case-police-say-probe-taking-time/articleshow/86827233.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry appeals to govt to waive cess on inland cargo||PANAJI: Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Wednesday appealed to transport minister Mauvin Godinho to waive off the Goa Rural Improvement and Welfare Cess on cargo that is moved via inland and coastal vessels. GCCI also requested the minister to improve road connectivity to public and private jetties, which would give a boost to the inland shipping and logistics sector. The transport department levies the Goa Rural Improvement and Welfare Cess on cargo such as minerals, other than iron ore and coal imported and transported in Goa. “With the implementation of GST, such levies, which were prevalent in other states, have been abolished and the result is that most cargoes, which are handled in Goa, are levied cess, resulting in higher logistic costs as compared to the neighbouring states,” said member of GCCI’s logistics committee Naresh Mandrekar An exemption on payment of cess for minerals imported and handled in Goan inland waterways would give relief to the coastal and inland waterways industry. “Bauxite is one such commodity, which could be imported at Goa port, and abolishing the cess could result in substantial savings in inland transport and will be viable for the importer as well as the transporters. This could also open the avenues of more such imports at Goa port and give business to local stakeholders in the inland shipping sector,” said GCCI director Sanjay Amonkar. GCCI claimed that Godinho understood the concern and assured the delegation that their concern would be addressed. GCCI treasurer Chandrakant Gawas, Amonkar and Mandrekar met Godinho and submitted a written appeal where they also said that public and private jetties have “serious issues” regarding first and last mile road connectivity. “GCCI recommended identifying such jetties in Goa and widening the approach roads to such jetties along with other infra, such as power and water supply for smooth movement of cargo within the state,” said Amonkar. Godinho said that he had always been working to boost the Goan economy and would provide the necessary infrastructure and support for the industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-appeals-to-govt-to-waive-cess-on-inland-cargo/articleshow/86821804.cms||---

In its September 24 judgment , the bench of Justice Ravindra V Ghuge and Justice S G Mehare asked the state to “make the 2005 Rules applicable uniformly to all employees of the Government, State instrumentalities, local authorities and local bodies, if the laudable object of controlling the growth of population is to be achieved.” The bench said, “We find such rule to be not only unwarranted, but harmful for the reason that on the one hand, this country is grappling with the problem of population explosion and by introducing the 2005 Rules, the State of Maharashtra has taken a progressive step to control the problem and encourage the people to have a small family of only two children.”  The bench said, “On the other hand, these rules are not made applicable to the employees of the local authorities though similar provisions are made applicable to the persons who seek election to the Gram Panchayat, Municipality and Zilla Parishad, by introducing the disqualification clause.” “In this backdrop, Rule 6 permitting the government to relax the mandate of small families would be counter-productive. So also, these rules need to be made applicable even to the employees of the local authorities like the gram panchayat,” the bench said. The matter arose from a petition filed by a peon from the Karetakali gram panchayat in Shevgaon taluka of Ahmednagar district, challenging a show cause notice of December 26, 2019 asking him to explain why action should not be initiated against him for having more than two children. A woman from the gram panchayat had on July 11, 2019 sought the peon’s removal from service — in view of a government notification of March 28, 2005 that introduced the Rules of 2005 with a prospective effect — claiming he had three sons. In the petition the peon pleaded, Rule 5 of the 2005 Rules stated the rules cannot be applied with a retrospective effect. He pleaded he was appointed by a gram sevak in March 2004 i.e. before the rules were introduced, and he was not a state employee but a gram panchayat employee where the rules cannot be applied. The HC had appointed lawyer Ajay S Deshpande as amicus curiae (friend of the court) to give his opinion on the larger issue of applicability of the Rules of 2005 and on the issues raised by the petitioner. Amicus curiae Deshpande submitted though the employees of the gram panchayat may not be the employees of the Government of Maharashtra, considering the Panchayat Raj system introduced by the Constitutional amendment, the small family principle needs to be implemented at all levels and should be applied to all families. HC acknowledged the amicus curiae’s views while recommending to the government to delete Rule 6, it directed the competent authority that issued the show cause notice to proceed in accordance with law and decided if 2005 Rules are applicable to the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delete-rule-allowing-ease-in-2-kid-norm-for-govt-staff/articleshow/86825763.cms||Vishwas Kothari

Close to 42 lakh voters are electing 78 district panchayat ward members, 755 panchayat union ward members, 1,577 village panchayat presidents and 12,252 village panchayat ward members under the first phase of polls. The second phase of polls will be held on October 9. Polling in the nine districts - Chengalpet, Kallakurichi, Kancheepuram, Ranipet, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, Tirupathur, Vellore and Villupuram - began at 7am on Wednesday on a sluggish note, registering just 7.7% voting in the first two hours but momentum picked up as the day progressed and registered 74.4% at end of polling. Villupuram registered the maximum polling with 81.4% followed by Ranipet (81%), Kanceepuram (80%), Tirupathur (78%), Tenkasi (74%), Kallakurichi (72%), Tirunelveli (69%), Vellore and Chengalpattu with 67% each.

People, who queued up at polling booths before 6pm were given tokens to enable them cast votes even after the deadline ended. Polling in Ullavoor panchayat in Walajabath union in Kancheepuram district was stopped after the name of a candidate was spelt wrongly. Candidate Tha. Lakshmi's name was spelt wrongly as Dhanalakshmi and the issue was noticed after a few voters exercised their right and the supporters of the candidates picked up an argument with the polling officers, which resulted in polling coming to a halt. Tension gripped a polling booth at Sipcot government school premises in Walaja in Ranipet district when DMK men and opposition AIADMK cadres picked up a wordy duel. The AIADMK men accused DMK men of canvassing votes for their candidate at the polling booth. The cadres of two parties started pushing and pulling each other and a team of policemen on duty managed to disperse them. The residents in wards 7, 8 and 9 in Ponangkuppam village near Gingee in Villupuram district boycotted polls urging the state to carve out Ponangkuppam from Thuthipet panchayat and upgrade it as a separate panchayat. Twenty-two candidates from Ponangkuppam withdrew their candidatures to press their demands for upgrading the hamlet as a separate panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-74-cast-votes-in-first-phase-polling/articleshow/86827312.cms||---

The sum, however, was ‘scaled down’ to Rs 25 lakh by the abductors. A history-sheeter, ‘Aruppu’ Kumar who faces about 40 cases, and four of his men kidnapped Moosa, a timber businessman who dealt with red sanders too. Police sat with the family for three days so as not to miss any ransom call and to ensure the family did not bypass police and pay up. In the late-night hours of Tuesday, the family and the abductors agreed to a ransom of Rs 25 lakh in cash. While the cash was being handed over, police swooped on the culprits, nabbing two of them, including Aruppu Kumar. Both cash and the abducted person were taken to safety. It was dramatic, when plain-clothed head constable Saravanakumar pounced on the bonnet of the culprits’ car when they tried to escape with the cash after leaving Moosa near Pantheon Road in Egmore. He was dragged for about 20 feet, before the other alert cops rounded up the car at gunpoint. Still three others fled the scene and vanished in the dark. A 1970-batch direct sub-inspector of police, Moosa, 82, of Harrington Road in Chetpet, was into wood export business. He had engaged the services of 'Aruppu' Kumar, who claimed to have been leading a reformed life. Following irregularities in business, Kumar plotted to abduct Moosa. On Sunday night, Kumar and his men reached Moosa's residence when the latter was alone on the ground floor, and abducted him in Moosa's own car. A few hours later, the gang brought back the car and left it behind the house. Inquiries revealed that Kumar told a woman contact that he had abducted Moosa, as he failed to repay a loan. Moosa negotiated with the gang to settle for Rs 25 lakh and informed his son Basheer and a few friends to arrange the money through their hawala sources in Dubai. However, Basheer approached the Kanathur police station with a complaint. The police team led by the Kilpauk DCP Karthikeyan and Adyar DCP (in-charge) Mahendran laid a trap .On Tuesday night, Basheer handed over the cash to Aruppu Kumar after they released Moosa after receiving Rs 25 lakh ransom. As soon as Moosa got off the vehicle, the police team chased the car. They nabbed Aruppu Kumar and the car driver Prakash of Sirkazhi at gunpoint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kidnappers-of-trader-nabbed-at-gun-point-chennai-police/articleshow/86827386.cms||A Selvaraj

During the speech in Manchester, Patel said, "Our (Conservative party) values embody service before self and this can be neatly defined by the Hindu (sic) word ‘sewa’, which can mean service, commitment and dedication to others. Ensuring the best interests of our country come first is what drives me each and every day. That is my responsibility and that is my service and that is our party. It is because of our commitment to putting the needs of the hard-working silent majority first that I will not tolerate the so-called eco warriors trampling over our way of life," she said in reference to Extinction Rebellion protesters blocking motorways. Amandeep Madra, founder of the UK Punjab Heritage Association, tweeted a video of Patel’s "sewa" reference and wrote: "Oi mate, do you speak Hindu". Indian-origin Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi quote-tweeted him, saying: "Agree @amanmadra, what language is Hindu? Her comment is just so wrong on so many different levels. No wonder many Sikhs and others are outraged by it! Ministers really ought to be much better briefed about languages and the meaning of words." But Anil Bhanot, interfaith director at the Hindu Council UK, told TOI that "sewa" is a Hindu word in the same way "dharma" is, and that Patel had meant to use it. "Sewa is an ancient Hindu concept from the Vedas. It’s selfless service without expectation for any acknowledgment, and is done by Nishkam Karma as Bhagwan Krishna mentions in the Bhagwad Gita. It is a Sanskrit word, not Hindi word. Hindi did not exist then. Sikhs do langar sewa but the concept originated in Hinduism. Many Hindus do sewa," he said. Some UK PIOs were delighted that the UK’s first British Indian cabinet minister had highlighted the Hindu concept in her speech. British Indians Voice tweeted: "#BritishIndians thank Rt Hon Priti Patel for her seva." But Indian-origin Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill tweeted: "Compassion is a key part of sewa. Selfless service for the betterment of all mankind. It’s clear @pritipatel does not know the meaning of the word given cuts to universal credit, no plan to protect women, tax rises hitting working families. Cuts to aid and takeover of DFID (Department for International Development)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/twitter-storm-erupts-over-priti-patels-sewa-reference-in-party-conference-speech/articleshow/86827316.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Alleging that the minister has a criminal history, the Morcha claimed, “The central government ignored the open threat that he gave to farmers on September 25, two weeks before four of them were run over. We have reports of several cases against both the minister and his son.” The SKM said if the minister was not sacked by the day of memorial service for the killed farmers, there will be consequences. The SKM questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident while he was in UP on Tuesday. It claimed that instead of arresting Ashish, the UP police had given him cover to escape the crime scene. It opposed the case against farmer unionist Tajinder Singh Virk, claiming he was the victim of attack and among those injured in Lakhimpur Kheri. Farmers want the police to drop their case against Virk. “Video clips show that Virk was among the peaceful marchers whom the Thar had crushed from behind. He lay bleeding and dazed on the road, while the others scurried to help him. The FIR against him is a cruel joke,” the SKM said. The farmers’ front also demanded an investigation into the complaint that UP cops didn’t try to save journalist Raman Kashyap, among those whom Ashish’s reported convoy had mowed down.The farmers’ front also demanded an investigation into the complaint that UP cops didn’t try to save journalist Raman Kashyap, among those whom Ashish’s reported convoy had mowed down. He was taken straight to a mortuary instead of being treated, claims the morcha. Police are also yet to turn the complaint of the journalist’s father into an FIR (first-information report). The conglomerate of 31 farmers’ unions resolved to continue its campaign against Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was caught on tape telling his partymen to raise a force to take on the farmers, and demanded his resignation. In Rajasthan, the farmers of Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh, who seek paddy procurement and canal water, accused the Ashok Gehlot government of ignoring their demands and sought action against the cops who had caned farmers. They want all procurement on MSP (minimum support price). Foreign MPs speak The SKM said the Lakhimpur Kheri killings had been condemned by not only chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Delhi, Punjab and Jharkhand but even the British and Canadian MPs.

On Wednesday, a total of 1,432 people tested positive for the virus. This the lowest number of daily corona positive cases reported in the state during the second wave. Chennai with a test positivity rate (TPR) of one percent once again had the highest number of fresh cases (176). Coimbatore with a slightly higher TPR of 1.5 % stood second with 149 new cases. Thanjavur and Krishnagiri had the highest TPR (1.8 %) in the state. However, the state's overall TPR has remained unchanged at one percent for a month. This coupled with a steady recovery rate of 98% has helped in bringing down the number of active cases to 16,637. Three weeks ago, more than 17,000 patients were undergoing treatment. Among these patients, only one-third required hospilation and others were treated either at covid care centres or at their homes. Health authorities attribute this to increased vaccine coverage. As on date, 4.7crore vaccinations were recorded in Tamil Nadu. This included 1.1 lakh inoculations on Wednesday. Around 600 village panchayats and four municipalities have achieved 100 percent vaccination against Covid-19 with at least first dose. Overall, around 64% of the population has received at least one dose and 22% have got completely vaccinated. Health minister Ma Subramanian said the fifth mega-vaccination camp will be organised on Sunday through 30,000 special centres across the state. As on Wednesday, TN has 33 lakh vaccine doses in hand and another consignment is expected to reach this week. "So, vaccinations will continue for next three days and by Saturday evening, we expect to have at least 25 lakh doses in hand for the mega-vaccination camp," he said. Over 87 lakh people got inoculated at the previous mega camps. On Wednesday, 25 people succumbed to the disease thereby taking the Covid toll to 35,707.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/tamil-nadu-to-hold-fifth-mega-vaccination-camp-on-sunday-health-minister-ma-subramanian/articleshow/86833418.cms||---

---||India||When farmer leader Tikait turned firefighter to defuse tension in Kheri||LUCKNOW: Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), who has emerged as a firebrand farmer leader for leading the protests against the three farm laws, showed the other side of his personality – that of a deft mediator – which helped the state government defuse tension in the aftermath of Lakhimpur Kheri incident. There are many in the Opposition who are terming Tikait as “unreliable” so far as his allegiance is concerned, there are others who believe that by acting as a negotiator between the farmers and the government, he proved that he is not playing into the hands of any political party but is concerned about the cause of the farmers. There might be some truth in both the opinions. Those who support the first theory corroborate their claims by digging into Tikait’s past and his political aspirations. Tikait joined the Delhi police in 1992 and resigned after a couple of years to join BKU. He unsuccessfully contested assembly elections from Khatauli seat in 2007 on Bahujan Kisan Dal (BKD) ticket with the support of the Congress party. In 2014, he contested the Lok Sabha election from Amroha on Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket. Tikait was appointed the spokesperson of BKU in 2018. His elder brother Naresh Tikait took over as BKU president after the death of their father and farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait in 2011. However, those supporting Tikait say had politics been his motive, he would not have rushed to Kheri and stay there for three days to ensure justice is meted out to the family of victims. Irrespective of diverse views on his motive, the fact that the Yogi Adityanath government reposed complete faith in Tikait has come as a surprise to many. According to sources, soon after Tikait announced his plan to visit Kheri, UP government officials contacted him and assured him that he would be provided a smooth passage. The idea was that since the issue was related to farmers, Tikait should not be stopped from reaching Kheri as any hindrance to his movement could further agitate the farmers. Even Tikait, who has a good rapport with many officials earlier posted in the West UP region, assured them that he believed that there should be peace in the region and no one should be allowed to take political advantage of the situation. Tikait reached Kheri on October 3 night and immediately started deliberations with officials. His main demands included Rs 1 crore compensation each to the next of kin of deceased farmers, a government job to one of the family members, FIR against Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and his son Ashish Mishra and the arrest of the accused. Sources said the government officials agreed to all the demands and kept on negotiating on the compensation amount. After several rounds of discussions, Rs 45 lakh ex gratia was agreed upon, they added. According to sources, at no point Tikait showed any aggression as he knew that such a behaviour could trigger tension. Tikait played a crucial role in bringing the situation back to normal. He even rushed to Bahraich to convince the family members of one of the deceased farmers who were not ready to perform the last rites. According to political analysts, Tikait’s role in Kheri will cement his position as a farmer leader as his image was that of a leader of only Jat farmers. On social media too, Tikait was being painted as a troublemaker but his mediation in the Kheri incident may change his image to that of a trouble-shooter, analysts said. Talking to media persons in Kheri on Wednesday, Tikait said role in Kheri notwithstanding, the farmers’ agitation would continue till the three farm laws were withdrawn by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/when-farmer-leader-tikait-turned-firefighter-to-defuse-tension-in-kheri/articleshow/86827449.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Chandigarh||Farm outfits get buses to take activists to protest sites||Barnala: Besides arranging tractors for farming activities or tents to save farmers from vagaries of weather at protest sites, the farm groups of Punjab are also arranging for buses to ferry protesters from one place to another. At some of the places, the district or block level units of the farm organisations have made arrangements of transportation instead of hiring various modes of transport to reach the designated places of protests or common works of the units. Various units of farm organisations BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) have arranged their own buses. Other farm outfits are also not lagging behind. The Bhadaur, Mehla Chowk, Lehra units of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) have purchased own buses. The Bhadaur unit in Barnala district has even prepared a bed-cum-platform in the rear of the bus for women, older or sick persons for the purpose of taking rest while in transit. Jasbir Singh of Bhadaur, who drives the bus, said the bus ferries normally 50 activists. “We had spent Rs 4.6 lakh for preparing the bus and have been using it to take people to borders of Delhi at protests against farm laws. Following a call for protests at offices of the deputy commissioners against the killing of farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri, we took the activists in the bus without waiting to hire any other mode of transport,” he added. Balwant Singh of BKU Sidhupur’s Sehjara unit in Barnala said, “We arranged our own minibus for the convenience of activists.” Pics: Buses of BKU Ugrahan, BKU Sidhupur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-outfits-get-buses-to-take-activists-to-protest-sites/articleshow/86822515.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Kolkata||Didi, 2 other MLAs to be administered oath today||Kolkata: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar will step into the Bengal assembly on Thursday to administer the MLA oath to chief minister Mamata Banerjee as well as Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam. In a break from the past, the governor chose not to delegate the power to administer oath to Speaker Biman Banerjee and decided to do it himself. Though powers are vested with the governor under the Constitution to administer oath to MLAs, these are usually delegated to the pro tem speaker or speaker. Veteran jurist Justice Chittatosh Mookerjee said he had not heard of or seen any governor administer the oath of MLA. The former Calcutta High Court and Bombay HC chief justice said: “I do not know why he (the governor) withdrew the power (to administer oath to MLAs) from the speaker. The governor usually doesn’t perform this function and delegates the power.” Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “The governor usually administers oath to the chief minister and the council of ministers. But in this case, he will be administering oath to MLAs, and not the CM or ministers. I do not know what purpose will be served by his administering the oath. This could easily have been delegated.” Even in the Lok Sabha, the pro term speaker initially or the speaker later — once they are elected — are delegated similar powers by the President. Trinamool Congress hasn’t formally reacted to the development. It was Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee who had written to the governor requesting him to come to the assembly to administer the oath to the three newly-elected MLAs, including the CM. A senior leader said: “Speaker Banerjee has been very vocal against the governor for interfering in the speaker’s domain. He had flagged this issue at the speakers’ conclave on two occasions.” EOM||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-2-other-mlas-to-be-administered-oath-today/articleshow/86821589.cms||---
---||Kolkata||TMC poll win has crafted Bengal model for a new India, says CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Congress must realise the reality that it has failed to fight BJP in Delhi, and the last two Lok Sabha elections bear testimony to that, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has written in the Puja edition of ‘Jago Bangla’, which was released on Wednesday. She said “Trinamool Congress has shown that this battle (against BJP) can be won”. “Time beckons Trinamool Congress to fill the void in Delhi,” Banerjee said. “We are never talking of an alliance without Congress, even thinking of it. We are not worried about who leads the opposition front, but Congress has to realise this reality,” she added. In the article penning the Congress vis-à-vis Trinamool contrast, Banerjee further wrote: “The entire country was looking at the Bengal poll outcome. They had witnessed that all BJP leaders across the country had taken a plunge in the Bengal poll battle. And people now realise that the combined strength of BJP wasn’t enough to take on Trinamool Congress.” “In the fight against BJP, this is the Bengal model. We looked them in the eye and fought for ideology and principles and fought for people’s development,” she continued. “There is a demand nationwide to remove the autocratic and fascist BJP from Delhi. Trinamool Congress has given this hope and belief. People are urging us across states to step out of Bengal and lead this fight, to make a new India.” “We have to respond to the call of time. We must fulfil people’s aspirations. We must take the responsibility to build the country,” Banerjee further wrote. “It is a necessity that all parties opposed to BJP forces should come together. Not for their own arithmetic, but this needs to be done for larger interests of the country. This alliance will be on policies and programmes. Congress will be part of this alliance.” Referring specifically to Congress here, she argued: “If there isn’t a fight in Delhi, then people’s confidence gets broken, and BJP gets a few more votes (than it should) from the states. We cannot let this happen again. And if it happens (again), then there will always remain a vacuum in the opposition alliance.” Highlighting Trinamool’s role, she said: “The Bengal elections have shown how Trinamool Congress has defeated BJP’s entire might. Those who were running the country (actually, sinking it) were daily passengers to Bengal. They spread canards. Deployed central agencies. But still couldn’t defeat Trinamool Congress. This is history. This is a model. And people have faith in this model.” “People are dreaming of a new India with Trinamool Congress,” she continued. “Trinamool Congress is keen to work with all opposition parties. But this model must be showcased to the people. Trinamool Congress will never step back from fulfilling people’s aspirations.” Recalling her party’s stance against CPM, Banerjee wrote: “There was a time in Bengal when Trinamool Congress had emerged as the real face in the fight for rights and independence against the CPM. Now CPM is a diminishing force, far away from relevance. And now people are reposing their love in Trinamool Congress for their development work. And with the tide of time, Trinamool Congress is now emerging as the real face against the BJP.” “And Trinamool Congress will keep working relentlessly to establish a democracy loving, progressive and secular new India and free the country from anti-people BJP,” she added. Starting the article on a personal note, Banerjee wrote: “Posts are of no significance to me. I have got many posts in my life, and have left many... There is no bigger post than people’s love and faith. One doesn’t need a post to fight. But it is also a fact that in parliamentary democracy, if one intends that the government works for people, one must either remain in it or have influence over it.” “Time may change priorities but not the core belief. My belief has always been to be with people, to help them, to work for them, to solve their problems,” she added.

---||Kolkata||Muslims revive Durga Puja in heart of Kolkata with help from Hindu families||KOLKATA: Local Muslim residents have revived a Durga Puja in a predominantly Muslim neighbourhood in the heart of the city that was discontinued nine years ago after most Bengali Hindu families migrated from the area and the three families that stayed back were unable to carry forward the tradition. The pandal is coming up at the original venue — next to the pavement opposite Pratt Memorial School on AJC Bose Road and a stone’s throw from CPM’s Alimuddin Street office — and the Muslim organisers are being enthusiastically guided by members of a Bengali Hindu family who have been living in the area for decades. The organisers supervise the construction of the pandal on AJC Bose Road on WednesdayThe shared spirit of communal harmony and festivity might appear extraordinary to the outside world at a time when convergence of religion and politics has frayed the social fabric, but for those staying around Alimuddin Street, a lower middle-class neighbourhood of mostly Urdu-speaking Muslims, this harmonious co-existence of the two communities has always been the normal. Jayanta and Sharmila Sen, members of one of the three Bengali Hindu families left in the area, were surprised when some local Muslim residents approached them a few weeks ago with the proposal of reviving the Durga Puja. “This Durga Puja had started in the late 1960s. At one point, my husband too was active in organising the Puja but gradually most families settled elsewhere, and nobody was left to shoulder the responsibility. But when the local Muslims approached us for guidance because they are not aware of the rituals, we were both surprised and touched. We decided to extend all possible help so that they can organise the Puja,” said Sharmila. ‘Durga Puja was a shared culture of this locality’After a group was formed to look into the logistics and money collected, Jayanta Sen, Mohammad Tauseef Rahman and others went to Kumartuli to book the idol. “Most of us have very fond memories of this Durga Puja. As children we would go to the pandal and spend a lot of time there. It was a shared culture of this area. We wanted to revive the Puja for our Bengali bothers and sisters,” said Rahman, a social activist. “We have a shared history of peaceful co-existence and the festive spirit will strengthen the bond between the people,” he added. Now, the entire neighbourhood is waiting for the day the Goddess will come to their pandal. The Sens and the other Hindu families have gladly taken up the responsibility of performing the rituals on the Puja days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/muslims-revive-durga-puja-in-heart-of-city-with-help-from-hindu-families/articleshow/86821808.cms||Zeeshan Javed
