It can be the issue of BJP”, he said while talking to reporters at Rajiv Bhawan, the state Congress headquarters, after a meeting of party functionaries. State Congress president Mohan Markam and chief minister Bhupesh Baghel were among those who attended. Punia was replying to a statement of senior BJP leader and former minister Brijmohan Agrawal that Congress should make its stand clear on the reports regarding two and a half year rotational CM formula, particularly in the light of power-struggle that broke out in August in the ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh. Asked about the acts of ‘indiscipline’ by the Congress legislators by issuing public statements, the AICC general secretary said it is not necessary to take cognizance of each and every statement or issue notices. A power struggle broke out in the ruling Congress in August this year following reports regarding a possible change of guard in the state. Speculations were rife that at the time of formation of Congress government in December 2018 assembly elections, there was an understanding that chief minister Bhupesh Baghel would be chief minister for the first two and a half years and health minister T S Singh Deo would take over for the remaining tenure of two and a half years. Several rounds of meetings took place with the party high command in Delhi during which supporters of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel flexed muscles for the show of strength in Delhi as well as in the state capital. Subsequently, the chief minister and his loyalist MLAs returned to the state capital while health minister T S Singh Deo maintained that the high command has 'reserved its decision' regarding the leadership change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/rotational-cm-formula-is-not-an-issue-for-congress-says-aicc-general-secretary-pl-punia/articleshow/87028704.cms||---

---||Goa||Must work to win 2022 Goa assembly polls to pay tribute to Parrikar: Devendra Fadnavis||PANAJI: Senior BJP functionaries Devendra Fadnavis and CT Ravi said on Thursday that the party should work to form the next government in Goa to pay tribute to former chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Fadnavis, the party’s election in-charge for Goa, said that if someone wishes to see the real face of Trinamool Congress, they should visit West Bengal, where there is 'no democracy'. Addressing karyakartas at Taleigao, Fadnavis said that the upcoming Goa election is a different one, and that parties are fighting to become the main opposition party in the state. He said it is 'our responsibility' to win and pay tribute to Parrikar. The former Maharashtra CM said that Delhi is not a full-fledged state, and that police and PWD are looked after by the Union government. He said that only two things are with the AAP government — education and health. “They get a lot of money as it is the capital city, and they go around the country saying that they want to implement the Delhi model,” he said. Slamming TMC, Fadnavis said that whatever is seen in Goa is from that party’s publicity department. He alleged that in West Bengal, “if you speak about democracy, you will be assaulted, and if you demand your rights, you will be hanged”. “Some people want to get such a government in Goa, (but) the people of the state will not allow it,” he said. “This isn’t the culture of Goa and we should not allow such a culture in Goa.” Meanwhile, Ravi, the BJP’s Goa desk in-charge, said that he prayed to grant BJP a hat-trick victory, to work for the people of the state and to carry out development. “We want a hat-trick in the next assembly election to pay tribute to former CM Parrikar,” Ravi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/must-work-to-win-2022-goa-assembly-polls-to-pay-tribute-to-parrikar-fadnavis-ravi/articleshow/87028584.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Chandigarh||Charanjit Singh Channi calls for change in obsolete land laws to safeguard ownership rights||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday called for an immediate systematic change in the archaic land laws to safeguard the proprietary ownership rights of people. He said the initiative would go a long way to streamline the existing procedure of girdawari, mutation, Jamabandi besides division thus saving the people from sheer exploitation through illegal and fraudulent practices to divest them from their proprietary rights. Chairing a meeting of all deputy commissioners, Channi directed the chief secretary to constitute a committee in consultation with the financial commissioner (Revenue) comprising deputy commissioner, district revenue officer, Tehsildar, Patwari to suggest reforms in the state land laws so as to simplify them. He also asked the chief secretary to bring a detailed proposal to abolish the system of girdawari so as to ensure ownership rights only vests in the legitimate owner as several states have already done away with this system. He gave a 'stern warning' to the DCs to stamp out the corruption from the public life. Channi categorically said that it has to be eradicated at the cutting edge without showing any complacency. He also asked them to ensure their punctuality in offices from 9 am and even work beyond 5 pm to effectively deliver the goods to the satisfaction of the general public. Without mincing any words, he said that no one would be allowed to function from their camp offices. He also asked the DCs to ensure prompt redressal of public grievances and keep their meetings with field officers after 5 pm so that they could exclusively concentrate on the administrative functioning and reserve any two days in a week for field visits to supervise the ongoing development activities. Attributing clean, responsive and transparent administration as the hallmark of his government, Channi asked the deputy commissioners to organise Suwidha Camps to clear the backlog of social security pensions including old age, disabled, destitute, and widows besides ashirwad shagan. He also directed them to hold these camps on 20th and 21st besides 29th and 30th October at tehsil, block and district level. Likewise, the next schedule for such Suwidha Camps to be organized would be soon notified by the CMO. To speed up the ongoing development works and welfare schemes, Channi also asked the DCs to have meetings with the MLAs to redress their various concerns related to their respective constituencies on priority. He also asked them to depute field staff to get the prescribed forms filled from all the eligible beneficiaries to waive off pending electricity bills having load up to 2 kw by reaching out to them. Likewise, he also underscored the need to ensure timely clearance of driving licenses, birth and death certificates, disabled certificates. Channi also warned the DCs to keep a check over the functioning of their subordinate staff in the districts so as to curb the practice of putting unwarranted objections on the files so as to harass the general public. Coming down heavily on the 'prevailing system of corruption' especially in the registry offices, he asked the DCs not to allow Tehsildar to undertake registration beyond office hours after 5 pm, adding he said to ensure the availability of revenue officials in their offices from 9am to 5pm in field and only charge the prescribed fee for the registry. The chief minister also told the DCs not to unnecessarily delay the registry on frivolous grounds. The DCs would have to ensure that none from general public is forced to bribe for getting their works done like approval of building plans of their houses, driving and arms licenses from the field offices and asked them to put in place a mechanism to check corruption with heavy hand to ensure clean, responsive and transparent governance, which should apparently visible on the ground. Making a firm resolve to effectively address the problems of drug trafficking and mining, he solicited support to get the culprits nabbed who are involved in such malpractices with the help of local representatives in both urban and rural areas. Underlining the significance of health and education being the core sectors, the chief minister asked the deputy commissioners to often make surprise visits to ensure the punctuality of the doctors and paramedics and teachers. Any employee found absent or delinquent in performing his/her duties should be immediately placed under suspension. In a bid to protect the properties of NRIs, Channi reiterated his Government’s firm commitment that requisite legal framework should be strengthened so that the NRIs are not dispossessed of their properties in the state by illegal/fraudulent practices in connivance with unscrupulous elements. He also asked the district administrations to prevail upon the NRIs to adopt some schools/hospitals/educational institutions with a sense of belongingness towards their motherland under the state government scheme, in which matching grant is given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/charanjit-singh-channi-calls-for-change-in-obsolete-land-laws-to-safeguard-ownership-rights/articleshow/87028623.cms||---
---||India||India ‘takes note’ as China, Bhutan ink border talks MoU||NEW DELHI: Bhutan and China signed an MoU Thursday for what they called a "Three-step roadmap" for expediting the Bhutan-China boundary negotiations and which according to Thimphu will provide fresh impetus to talks and can bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion acceptable to both sides. The MoU comes at a time India's own talks with China to resolve the military standoff in eastern Ladakh remain inconclusive. Like India, Bhutan remains locked in a boundary dispute with China and while the two have held 24 rounds of border talks since 1984, the last time they held these boundary negotiations was in 2016, or before the Doklam dispute involving India in 2017. India closely follows all boundary engagements between Bhutan and China as Chinese claims over disputed territories have serious security implications for New Delhi. The MEA was extremely cautious in reacting to the development as it said the government had noted the signing of the agreement. ``“We have noted the signing of the MoU between Bhutan and China. You are aware that Bhutan and China have been holding boundary negotiations since 1984. Similarly, India has been holding boundary negotiations with China,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, when asked about whether or not Bhutan had kept India informed about the MoU. For many, and going by past behaviour, it’s inconceivable that Bhutan would not have discussed an MoU on the boundary issue without explaining at least the broad contours to Indian authorities. Bhutan has so far not accepted the Chinese 1996 ``package deal’’ that offered to exchange territory in central Bhutan for Doklam, located dangerously close to India’s Siliguri Corridor. China reiterated this land swap offer last year. The 2017 Doklam standoff further complicated the border issue as India saw PLA’s construction of a road in the Doklam area as a violation of the 2012 bilateral agreement that tri-junction boundary points between India, China and third countries will be finalised in consultation with the concerned countries. China settled the boundary with Russia with a formal agreement in 2008 and has reached agreements in some other cases, but remains embroiled in maritime disputes with Japan and several ASEAN nations. The text of the MoU, which was signed during a virtual ceremony, has not yet been made public. Bhutan said in its announcement that during the 10th expert group meeting with China in April this year, the sides had agreed on the roadmap that will apparently build on the 1988 Guiding Principles for the settlement of the boundary and expedite negotiations. In the media then, it was reported that Bhutan and China had discussed a three-step roadmap. A month later, there were reports that Bhutan had reservations about the roadmap, one of which related to China’s claim over the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan (close to the Arunachal border), and that Bhutan had suggested certain amendments. It’s not clear yet to what extent China has taken into account those amendments. Bhutan said the roadmap will provide fresh impetus to the boundary talks and that it expects that the implementation of this roadmap ``in a spirit of goodwill, understanding and accommodation’’ will bring the boundary negotiations to a successful conclusion that is acceptable to both sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-bhutan-sign-mou-for-border-talks-india-takes-note/articleshow/87029836.cms||Sachin Parashar

The incident comes four days after a JCO and four soldiers were killed in action while pursuing terrorists hiding in a forested area of Surankote in the same district. "There has been a fresh exchange of fire between Army troops and terrorists during the ongoing counter-terrorist operation in the Nar Khas forest area of Mendhar subdivision," Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said. "The terrorists had been hiding in the forests of Rajouri-Poonch districts," he said, suggesting they might be the same ones involved in Monday's encounter that led to five casualties on the Army's side. Security forces have been scouring the forest area connecting the twin frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch since the gunfight at Surankote. "After the initial encounter at Charmer village of Surankote on Monday, the terrorists had fled to nearby Bhangai village of Rajouri, leading to another encounter," an official said. "The exchange of gunfire between the two sides stopped after some hours, suggesting the terrorists escaped." The entire forest belt in the Rajouri-Poonch axis has remained cordoned off since.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jco-soldier-hurt-in-fresh-jammu-gunfight-with-ultras/articleshow/87030529.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Lucknow||UP govt asks industries to adopt Miyawaki method to reduce carbon footprint||LUCKNOW: Bringing a major policy change to curb the carbon footprint in the country’s most populated state and to offset the industrial carbon emissions, the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday issued an order making it compulsory for industries to adopt the Japanese Miyawaki afforestation technique. Under the technique, the state pollution control board (UPPCB) has recommended industries to grow high-density micro forests in a minimum 150 sq meter of land to meet the mandatory requirement of 33% of area of the total land owned by an industry. The order signed by additional chief secretary, forest, Manoj Singh read, “Standard operating procedure (SOP) has been developed by UPPCB for Miyawaki afforestation technique. To control air pollution caused by industries, Miyawaki method of plantation is very effective, as these plantations have about 10 times more capacity to absorb air pollutants. Therefore, to develop green belt it’s compulsory for industrial units to adopt the Japanese technique. Technical guidance will be provided by divisional forest officers who will closely monitor the Miyawaki method-based plantation.” “If industrial units fail to comply with the order, appropriate action including revoking license to operate will be taken,” read the order copy. In Miyakawi forests only native species, which are originally found in the forest land in that area are grown in a specially prepared forest lawn soil having organic matter, water retention and percolation along with culture of microorganisms. Such forests have more than 99% of survival and need minimum maintenance. The forest-grown by this methodology grows 10 times faster, they are 30 times denser, 100 per cent biodiverse and natural. In the last one year, the UP government has covered over 19 hectares of land with micro forest in Lucknow’s Kukrail, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Ghaziabad. Talking to TOI, Ashish Tiwari, secretary, environment and forest climate said, “This technique is a vital solution for offsetting carbon emissions in the highly populated landscape like UP where land availability for the growing forest is limited. Miyawaki forest can be grown in a minimum 150 sq meters of the area to meet the mandatory requirement of 33% of the area of the total land owned by industry. Such efforts would offset the carbon footprint.” It costs around Rs 30,000 to develop Miyawaki forest in 150 sq meters of area. The UPPCB is now focusing on bringing educational institutes and residential areas to voluntarily adopt the Japanese plantation method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-asks-industries-to-adopt-miyawaki-method-to-reduce-carbon-footprint/articleshow/87027089.cms||Arvind Chauhan

He said the demand for LPG gas pipeline will also be given top priority by the government. The minister said this while speaking to the media during his visit to Jammu as part of the ongoing ‘Public Outreach Programme’ in J&K. The minister said that many schemes under the present government are reaching their saturation points. He cited that the PM Ujjwala Yojana that has provided eight crore LPG connections so far. Referring to J&K –Bhatinda Gas pipeline Project, Singh said, “Presently we have 19,000 kms of gas pipeline and it is likely to be extended to 35,000 kms i.e. additional 16,000 kms are to be added and J&K will be given priority.” “After abrogation of Article 370, the development projects that were languishing for years in J&K have been taken up and many have been completed in these years.

---||World||Impasse between Imran, Pakistan army over new ISI chief continues||ISLAMABAD: The controversy about the appointment of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief continues to linger on despite the government’s repeated claims that the country’s civilian and military leadership were on the same page regarding the issue. “The problem is that every hour some person, for getting fame, twists some words and puts it up on Twitter. At this time, the process has started. There is no conflict between the army and the government. Everyone is on the same page,” Pakistan’s information minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Thursday. He claimed that a specific section, which wants to play on this, has been defeated. Read AlsoPakistan army replaces ISI chief in surprise reshuffleIn a surprise move, Pakistan Army on Wednesday transferred the powerful spy agency ISI's chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed and appointed him as Peshawar Corps Commander. However, his replacement on the key post of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief was not immediately announced.The ministry of defence -- to be more specific army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa -- had announced the replacement of the outgoing spymaster Lt Gen Faiz Hameed by Karachi’s corps commander Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum on October 6. The decision was not welcomed by the PM as he was not consulted on it. Since Gen Bajwa’s decision, some of the cabinet members had started claiming that it was the PM’s prerogative to make an appointment of the ISI chief. Amir Dogar, one of Khan’s top aides, had recently claimed that the PM wanted to retain Hameed as his ISI chief. Following the reported impasse between the civil and military leadership on the issue, the PM’s office received a summary on Wednesday carrying names of three candidates and Khan, as a rule, has to choose one from them or pick up someone else for the ISI chief’s post. A day earlier, the information minister had said that the issue regarding the appointment was settled after a lengthy meeting between Khan and Bajwa. Hours later, one of the federal ministers was quoted by media as saying that the PM wanted to interview officials who were shortlisted for the position of ISI DG. Responding to the minister’s claim, the information minister said that it was a convention for the prime minister to meet candidates before appointments were made to key positions such as the ISI chief. “Now it is being said that the PM will conduct interviews for the new ISI chief,” he said. In response to a question about when the government would notify the new ISI chief, PM’s aide on political communication, Shahbaz Gill, who was accompanying the information minister, said: “Do not take this so urgently. It is serious business.” He said that the information minister would share the news with the media as soon as the prime minister makes a decision and urged the media to refrain from sensationalising national matters. The government’s claim about the PM receiving a summary for the appointment of the new spymaster has prompted netizens to poke fun at PM Khan, who had earlier said that he wanted Hameed to continue with his job. One of the posts that was frequently shared in social media groups said: “PM to nominate the next ISI chief from a list of three names recommended by the chief of army staff. The three names recommended by Gen Bajwa are Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum, Lt Gen Nadeem A Anjum and Lt Gen N A Anjum.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/impasse-between-imran-pak-army-over-new-isi-chief-continues/articleshow/87030793.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The minister has been accused of criminal conspiracy by farmers and his son has been arrested after being booked for killing four farmers and a journalist. “Between 10am and 4pm on Monday, protesters will stop trains across the country,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said at a private event in Aligarh on Thursday. Asked about the plan, Tikait told TOI, “Farmers from every district will stage blockades on their nearest rail lines. Minister Mishra has been accused of criminal conspiracy but he has not been summoned, nor has he been asked to step down. His son was arrested, but after a lot of delay. We won’t get justice if he remains in office. So, unless he is sacked, we are going ahead with our rail roko.” On October 3, farmers at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri were preparing for a black flag protest against minister Ajay Mishra and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya when Mishra’s convoy allegedly ran over protesters, killing four farmers and a journalist. The violence escalated and two BJP workers and a driver were also killed, allegedly by protesters. Farmers have further alleged that the killings were “planned” while Mishra has maintained that it was an “accident” that followed “protesters pelting stones at the convoy”. Preparations for the rail roko have begun. “In Punjab, we have identified 36 points for our blockade. We will make sure no train from any state passes through these points,” said Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda) in Punjab and working member of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. In UP’s Mathura, hundreds have been asked to turn up at each station. “About 600 people have been asked to gather at Raya station and nearly 400 at Mathura junction to stop trains. This was decided at a district-level meeting on Wednesday,” said Raj Kumar Tomar, district president of BKU (Ambavata) in Mathura. “Police have deployed PAC outside villages. We think it’s with the protest in mind.” The finer details of the plan for Monday’s rail roko will be drawn out on Friday. “We will decide on the details tomorrow (Friday). Our intention is to convey to the government that the agitation will continue until the minister is removed,” Harvinder Singh, president of BKU’s Uttarakhand youth unit, told TOI. Farmer leaders had earlier announced their protest plan if the minister was not sacked by October 12 — burning effigies of senior BJP leaders, rail roko and a mahapanchayat in Lucknow on October 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rail-roko-on-october-18-if-minister-isnt-sacked-farmers/articleshow/87031899.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The night temperature on Thursday dropped below 20 degrees Celsius for the first time this season, with the mercury falling to 19 degrees at Safdarjung. The upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh received snow on Wednesday, in the wake of which cool northwesterly winds led to a drop in temperatures in the northern plains. The wind direction is expected to change on Friday or Saturday, with temperatures expected to rise. Some rain is also expected from Saturday till Monday under the influence of a western disturbance. A minimum temperature of 19 degrees C is considered normal for this time of the year. The past three years had seen the mercury drop below 20 degrees C earlier than this year, which has seen a relatively warm October so far. Under the influence of the northwesterlies, the maximum temperature dropped to 33.9 degrees C from 36.7 degrees two days back. “Both maximum and minimum temperatures witnessed a decline on Thursday. The city has been mostly recording maximum and minimum temperatures above normal in October so far. Due to clear sky and northwesterly winds, the minimum temperature dropped on Thursday,” a met official said. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 19 degrees Celsius on Friday but could rise from Saturday. The met department predicted very light showers on October 16 and light to moderate rain on October 17 under the influence of a western disturbance. Light rain is expected on October 18 as well. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “Northwesterly winds are predicted to change to easterly on Friday or Saturday. Besides, patchy rain and partly cloud cover are likely on October 17 and 18 and it may cause a rise in minimum temperature.” According to IMD’s forecast, the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 21 degrees Celsius on October 16 and 17 and may touch 20 degrees Celsius on October 18. “After the rain activity is over, the temperature may again witness a slight dip. There are chances that the minimum temperature may drop to 19 degrees Celsius on October 19 and 20,” said a met official. He added that a steeper drop in the minimum temperature is likely in the last week of October or first week of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/snow-in-high-himalayas-delhi-temp-falls-to-19c/articleshow/87031959.cms||---

Now every provocation will see retaliation in equal measure,” he said. The warning came against the backdrop of efforts by Pakistan-based jihadi terror attacks to hurt India in J&K and in other parts. Shah said the surgical strikes across the Line of Control of 2016 changed the way the world looked at India. When India responded to the killings of our jawans in Uri with surgical strikes across the LoC, Shah said, a message was sent across the globe that flirting with India’s borders was now no longer an easy task. “The surgical strikes, for the first time ever, helped restore the honour of the nation’s borders and thus reinforced India’s sovereignty. ”Speaking at the bhoomi-pujan function of the National Forensic Science University at Dharbandora, Shah paid glorious tributes to former Goa chief minister and defence minister Manohar Parrikar stating that the seminal work done by him on the defence front had helped change the world’s outlook towards India. Shah said Parrikar would be remembered for a long time to come primarily for two things—one, for the implementation of one-rank-one-pension (OROP) for the armed forces, and two, for the 2016 surgical strikes. “Under PM Narendra Modi’s leadership, Parrrikar gave the gift of OROP to our armed forces. By implementing OROP, Modi-Parrikar in a way acknowledged the tyag, tapasya and balidan of our soldiers who spend the best years of their lives protecting our borders in hostile conditions, in temperatures ranging from -43 degrees C to +43 degrees C. The guardians of our borders have now been fully reassured that their families are being taken care of by the government of India. Modi and Parrikar will be remembered for ages,” Shah said. Lauding Parrikar for placing Goa on the trajectory of fast paced development, Shah fondly recounted a conversation he once had with Goa’s former CM. “Parrikar once said to me,” Shah said, “that smaller the state, bigger should be its development. I had replied that while the belief appeared to be simple and acceptable, it was difficult to be applied in practice. Parrikar retorted saying that Goa would definitely do and prove it one day. And when he became the chief minister of Goa, he did begin transforming Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-warns-enemies-against-flirting-with-indias-borders/articleshow/87032056.cms||Govind Maad

On being asked about the development, a CIL official said, “This is only a temporary prioritisation in the interest of the nation to tide over the low coal stock situation at stressed power plants and scale up supplies to them.” The company, the official said, is increasing its production and offtake steadily. For the past four days, supplies to the power sector are consistently at 1.61 million tonnes (MT) per day. Once the situation stabilises, expectedly within a short time, and stock at coal fired plants attains comfort level, other sectors will be brought back to their regular supply norm. In fact, supplies to the non-power sector during the first half of the current fiscal at a little over 62 million tonnes posted a 10% growth over last year same period and 11% compared to a Covid-free April-September 2019. Even since the demand for coal reached a higher pitch from the power sector from August, supplies to the non-regulated sector consumers were close to 18 MT during August-September, clocking a growth of 37% compared to pandemic free August-September 2019. Owing to skyrocketing coal prices at international markets, consumers have been vying for domestic coal, hiking up demand. Instead of restricting coal intake, had the power utilities stocked up coal from October of last year till February this year, as was repeatedly requested by coal companies of CIL, stock position at the plants would have been better, the official said. Coal minister Pralhad Joshi had on Wednesday said cumulative coal supplies to thermal power plants crossed 2 MT on Tuesday and dispatch of the dry fuel is being enhanced to plants. “Happy to share that cumulative coal supplies to thermal power plants from all sources including @CoalIndiaHQ recorded more than 2 million tonnes yesterday. We are increasing coal dispatch to power plants further to ensure sufficient coal stocks at power plants,” Joshi had said in a tweet. CIL expects to raise production after Dussehra, when workers are back from holidays and attendance picks up, the official said. Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coal-india-suspends-supplies-to-non-power-customers/articleshow/87032090.cms||---

More than half the passenger vehicles sold in September, as well as the July-September quarter, were SUVs that commanded more volumes than the cumulative might of hatchbacks and sedans. The strong showing — perhaps for the first time ever in India’s automotive history — displays the growing fondness and craze of Indian buyers for SUVs, which are available across price points and brands, and have one of the strongest line-ups in the broader car market. With sales of 87,720 units in September 2021, SUVs outnumbered the passenger cars category –– comprising hatchbacks and sedans — by a large distance as the latter could only sell 64,235 units in the same month. And the trend was equally strong during the second quarter of 2021-22 — SUVs sold 3,67,457 units while passenger cars added up to 3,43,939 units, according to data sourced by TOI from SIAM, the industry lobby group.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); So what’s fuelling the trend? The fall in prices of SUVs over the past few years — as companies adopted the body style even when it came to small cars (which attract lower GST rates) — and the broadening road and highway network across are pushing demand for the vehicles that have better ground clearance and relatively modern and robust design cues.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Prices of mini SUVs such as Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger begin at under Rs 6 lakh, while the sub-Rs 10 lakh category has strong models such as Maruti Brezza, Kia Sonet, Hyundai Venue and Tata Nexon.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The surge doesn’t stop here: popular models above Rs 10 lakh include Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Mahindra Thar, and MG Hector. And the craze keeps on getting stronger even as the prize shoots up multi-fold or by several lakhs of rupees — demand remains equally robust for luxury off-roaders from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Land Rover, and even the Lamborghinis and Porsche, many of whom are priced upwards of Rs 1 crore and are even stocked out.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); While automobile puritans remain critical about the popularity of small-sized low-powered SUVs — since they lack the traditional "heavy off-roading go-anywhere" features such as 4X4, water-wading capabilities, high torque and traction control — others do not agree much with the argument. "It’s the overall packaging that matters the most. SUVs give you the best value for money when it comes to style quotient, visibility, power, and cabin space. They provide command and control on the road," says Ravi Bhatia of auto research firm JATO. Shashank Srivastava, director (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki, says that the trend is not just confined to India, but is more or less a global shift. "The trend is across the world. In fact, if you look at markets such as China, the US, and countries in Latin America and Europe, the share of SUVs is around 45-50% to overall sales. India had been a late starter, but has been gaining swiftly," Srivastava says. He says that the fall in prices of SUVs have meant that they are now poaching customers from both hatchbacks and sedans. "There is now a huge price overlap of SUVs with premium hatchbacks and premium sedans. Customers who never considered buying an SUV previously are now looking at the vehicles since they are within their reach in terms of pricing and options." Companies have clearly read the trend, and thus most of the new launches are in the SUV category. Recently launched SUVs include Mahindra’s Thar and XUV7OO, Skoda Kushaq, VW Taigun, MG Astor, Hyundai Alcazar, and luxury ones such as Audi eTron series and Mercedes GLS Maybach. Recently, Anand Mahindra was gushing on social media as his company’s new launch XUV7OO managed a mega 50,000 bookings — signifying a value of Rs 10,000 crore — in just two rounds of sale. "The customer enthusiasm is staggering," Mahindra says. The "coming-soon" list remains equally strong with models such as Tata Motors’ Punch, Audi’s new-generation Q5, Q3 and Q7, Citroen’s localised C3, and luxury electric Model3 from Tesla and XC40 Recharge from Volvo. Martin Schwenk, MD & CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, says that demand has been phenomenal. "Our SUV portfolio has seen an unprecedented demand and has been on longer waiting lists… The SUV portfolio is waitlisted across markets, while the waitlist for the GLS extends up to six months, underlining the growing penchant for luxury SUVs." Hyundai, which is now the leader in the Indian SUV category, says that an SUV fulfils a customer’s desire for a vehicle that offers an array of features that include safety, comfort, technology and performance. "As the trend for segmented lockdowns and work from home has been prevalent, customers are also looking at breaking the monotony with leisure trips and getaways, fulfilling the desire to have SUVs."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-now-an-suv-market-sales-outstrip-hatches-plus-sedans/articleshow/87032143.cms||Pankaj Doval

Rawat’s remarks came after meeting Sidhu in New Delhi to resolve the continuing crisis triggered by the cricketer-turned-politician “resigning” his post in protest over appointments and portfolio allocations after new CM Charanjit Singh Channi took charge. “The instructions (from the central leadership) are clear that Sidhu should work as PCC president and set up the organisational structure… A bigger, formal announcement will be made tomorrow (Friday),” Rawat said. Sidhu’s fulminations, which have alternated with praise for Priyanka Gandhi’s response to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, had only muddled the scenario with Congress leaders worrying that his criticism could hurt the new government. It is likely these concerns were made evident to him. Sidhu, who had quit on September 28 by declaring he could “never compromise on Punjab’s future”, said he conveyed his concerns to the party brass and agreed to abide by “every decision” of the Gandhis. “I have full faith in the Congress president (Sonia Gandhi), Priyanka and Rahul... whatever decision they take will be in the interest of Congress and Punjab… Right from the beginning, I consider them supreme.” On the status of Sidhu’s formal resignation, which he had posted on Twitter, Rawat said, “A procedure has to be followed on every issue. We have our own system. You should wait till tomorrow.” The former Uttarakhand CM, who met Sidhu along with AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, is likely to brief Sonia on the discussion before the party formally makes a statement. Sidhu is likely to meet Sonia separately on Friday, sources said. The development comes amid reports that all is still not well between Sidhu and CM Channi. The Amritsar East MLA skipped the wedding of Channi’s son last week. Before Thursday’s meeting, Rawat said, “Sidhu and Channi have spoken on some issues, a solution will emerge... there are some things that take time.” Even though Rawat had tweeted to say that Sidhu had been called for the meeting to discuss organisational issues, it was believed that the party leadership wanted to address the new round of infighting in the state unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gandhis-supreme-says-sidhu-hell-remain-pcc-chief-congress/articleshow/87032191.cms||---

The 100 crore dose target is expected to be achieved by October 18 or 19, he said while launching a coffee table book on Covid warriors. There are plans that as vaccination coverage gets closer to the 1 billion mark, 80,000 vaccination centres will be activated to encourage more people to come forward and shed vaccine hesitancy. India’s Covid-19 vaccination coverage crossed 97.1 crore on Thursday evening. This includes over 69.2 crore people who have received the first dose and the cumulative number for the second dose has crossed over 27.86 crore. Mandaviya said Spicejet will wrap planes with posters announcing the one billion vaccine milestone with images of PM Modi and healthcare workers on the day the target of 100 crore doses is achieved. It is also proposed that besides announcements on loudspeakers, the national flag may be symbolically hoisted at key locations like Red Fort and North and South Block in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/100-crore-vaccination-mark-government-plans-big-outreach/articleshow/87032274.cms||---

In a series of tweets on Wednesday, as it announced talks between narcotics control authorities of the two countries to check drug trafficking, the Iranian embassy here said Iran had suffered from many trade restrictions and unjust sanctions for more than 40 years and that it was once again being targeted unfairly ``through denial of trade and banning its consignments as an unprofessional and imbalanced move’’. The Adani group’s decision followed the seizure of close to three tonnes of heroin originating from Afghanistan worth an estimated $2.65 billion from two containers at western Gujarat's Mundra Port, which is run by Adani Ports. Seeking to highlight Iran’s role in the fight against the drug menace, the embassy said it was for many decades that narcotics and organised drug trafficking from Afghanistan had posed a major threat to Iran, the region and to the world, necessitating a ``non stop and united struggle as well as a genuine cooperation and partnership among all countries against this global issue’’. The embassy said occupation of Afghanistan by foreign forces, infighting between various groups and severe poverty had all contributed to considerable rise of narcotic drugs production. ``In spite of that, such factors in particular foreign occupation and sudden flee (sic) of US forces and its allies from Afghanistan as the main root causes of recent surge in all chaos, insecurity, and exacerbation of drug trafficking in the region is ignored or underestimated,’’ said the embassy in another tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/iran-opposes-adani-move-to-not-handle-cargo/articleshow/87032298.cms||---
---||India||Badal, other Akali leaders briefly detained during protest over Centre's BSF jurisdiction order||CHANDIGARH: Some SAD leaders, including party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, were briefly detained by police here on Thursday when they tried to march towards the governor's residence to protest the Centre's decision to extend the BSF's jurisdiction in Punjab, among other states, according to officials. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) alleged that the police manhandled and hustled Badal and some party supporters who were part of the protest held outside the Raj Bhawan. Police said SAD leaders and supporters were briefly detained when they were marching towards the Governor's House. However, SAD said in a statement that Badal courted arrest and was taken to the Sector 3 police station along with senior party leaders and workers in a bus. The Union government has amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a 50-km stretch, instead of the existing 15 km, from the international borders in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. The Union home ministry issued a notification in this context on October 11, amending a July 2014 enabling provision for BSF personnel and officers while they operate in the border areas. Punjab shares border with Pakistan. Badal, who was accompanied by party leaders Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema, said that the Akalis wanted to meet Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit and apprise him that the Centre's move to "attack the federal structure" is not good. Addressing party leaders and workers at the protest site, Badal claimed, "Through this order, Amritsar city, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Fazilka and virtually half of Punjab will come under their (BSF's) domain. Law and order will eventually come under the Centre's control." He claimed Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi is sitting silently and "has surrendered, abdicated responsibility to secure few more months in power". The Akali Dal has been fighting to ensure that the country's federal structure remains intact and will continue to fight for it, he said. Channi had on Wednesday slammed the Centre's "unilateral decision" to extend the BSF's jurisdiction and called it a "direct attack on federalism". Badal alleged, "First the Centre framed the farm laws, a subject which is states' domain, and now they want to take control of law and order too." Meanwhile, Punjab ministers Pargat Singh and Vijay Inder Singla addressed a press conference and termed the Centre's decision to extend the BSF's jurisdiction an "attack on federalism". Pargat Singh also slammed former chief minister Amarinder Singh, who voiced his support for the Centre's move on Wednesday and said that it will "only make us stronger". Dubbing Amarinder Singh's statement as unfortunate, Pargat Singh said, "He acts like he is with the BJP." With this order, Pargat Singh claimed, half of Punjab will come under the BSF's control. The Centre wants to "later show Punjab as a disturbed state and push for the imposition of Governor's rule", he alleged. Singla said that the BJP-led central government is trying to "infiltrate rights of states, but it will not be allowed to break the federal structure". "We have seen earlier how the Centre has tried to weaken the rights and powers of states," he said. Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said security forces should not be used as a political tool. "We are proud of our security forces which are meant to secure our borders and protect India from foreign aggressors. Using them to cover up the failures & to clean up the mess created by leaders & govts is very alarming," he said in a tweet. "It not only denigrates our brave forces but also adversely affects their morale discipline & preparedness. It's this use of our forces as political tool which should be avoided. No one knows it better than @ capt_amarinder Singh ji," he said. The government notification will allow the BSF to execute the powers of search, seizure and arrest for the purpose of prevention of any offence punishable under the Passport Act, the Registration of Foreigners Act, the Central Excises and Salt Act, the Foreigners Act, the Foreign Exchange Management Act, the Customs Act or of any cognisable offence punishable under any other Central Act, according to officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/badal-other-akali-leaders-briefly-detained-during-protest-over-centres-bsf-jurisdiction-order/articleshow/87032358.cms||---

Fresh cases of the virus from across India totalled to 16,981 on Thursday (with data from Jharkhand and Sikkim not available till past midnight), as per TOI’s Covid database. On Wednesday, the count was 19,238. The daily count hasn’t crossed 20,000 since October 7, when 21,480 cases were recorded. The fall in cases was mainly due to Kerala numbers declining to 9,246, from 11,079 on Wednesday. At 2,384, Maharashtra recorded nearly the same number of fresh cases as on the previous day (2,219). Gujarat, where Covid numbers have been among the lowest in the country over the past two-three months, recorded 34 new cases on Thursday. This was the highest single-day count since July 24 and comes in the midst of Navratra celebrations in the state. Active cases in Gujarat, although just 215, were the highest in 71 days. Meanwhile, Haryana became the 13th state in the country to register more than 10,000 deaths. While the state reported no new fatality, 174 previous deaths were added to the overall toll. On Thursday, 199 more Covid deaths were reported in the country. Kerala reported 96 fatalities, followed by Maharashtra (35), Tamil Nadu (20), and Andhra Pradesh and Bengal (10 each).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-daily-covid-19-cases-stay-below-20000-for-a-week/articleshow/87032423.cms||---
---||India||Congress brass unlikely to go for immediate party polls||NEW DELHI: Congress may not accede to the demand for immediate organisational elections for electing the new party chief and may opt for a fresh party membership drive, a decision that may mean Sonia Gandhi continuing at the helm. The view in Congress could mean that the demand for G23 dissenters for internal polls, including for the CWC, may not find favour with the leadership. The CWC can, if it so chooses, name a party president who could be then ratified by the AICC. As the Congress working committee meets on Saturday to discuss among other things the demand for internal polls as sought by G23, party insiders said the likelihood of it being accepted is thin. Though Congress has been riven with calls for the election of the new chief for last one and a half years, the paradox is that the period has actually taken the party closer to the scheduled election calendar, end-2022. The last internal polls were held in 2017 December for a period of five years. Rahul quit the post midway in May 2019 after the Lok Sabha debacle. The view in the party is that with five important assembly elections coming up in March 2022, internal poll process may not be feasible now. In contrast, the party can initiate the membership drive which is the required first step to polls which can be held later in the year. Sources said the CWC may take a view on how to go about the next party election. In the absence of a clarity on the issue, speculations have been rife about individual Congress leaders been put up as interim arrangements, with names of Sachin Pilot and Kamal Nath floating around. Senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad recently wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi where he demanded internal polls as also a discussion on the state of the party affairs. While the CWC is being watched for whether the discussions lead to a confrontation between the G23 and the loyalists, much of the meeting could revolve around the coming assembly elections and the political situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cong-brass-unlikely-to-go-for-immediate-party-polls/articleshow/87032553.cms||---
---||India||In 2011, UPA tried to give BSF sweeping powers||NEW DELHI: Congress may have slammed as “anti-federal” the home ministry’s decision to extend BSF’s powers of seizure, search and arrest to a 50 km belt running along the international border in West Bengal, Assam, Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan, but in 2011, the then UPA government had gone a step further. The UPA had brought a bill in Rajya Sabha seeking to arm BSF with powers to search, seize and arrest in any part of the country where it is deployed resulting in considerable opposition to the proposed move. The opposition parties then led by BJP put up a stiff resistance citing federal concerns, forcing UPA to defer the Border Security Force (Amendment) Bill in March 2012. This was despite the department-related standing committee on home affairs, then chaired by M Venkaiah Naidu, having adopted the bill in November 2011 without any changes. BJP-ruled states, including Gujarat where PM Narendra Modi was then CM, opposed the move. The proposal at the time was, however, more sweeping than the decision taken by the NDA government. Then home minister P Chidambaram had, while seeking passage of the bill in the Rajya Sabha in March 2012, underlined that BSF is regularly deployed in the hinterland “on request of the state governments” for duties ranging from internal security to countering Left wing extremism or northeast insurgency to tackling communal riots and natural calamities, even though its charter limited its mandate to border areas notified from time to time under Section 139 of the BSF Act, 1968. He argued that an enabling provision was needed in the BSF Act to give the force powers to search, seize and arrest in the hinterland, so as to ensure its operational effectiveness. Chidambaram also highlighted that similar enabling provisions already existed in the Acts governing CRPF, ITBP and SSB. Chidambaram informed the Rajya Sabha that only 13 of 29 states from which MHA had sought comments on the proposed bill, had reverted, with Sikkim being the lone state to oppose the bill. West Bengal had then supported arming BSF with powers of seizure, search and arrest for duties, while Punjab and Assam never turned in their comments despite MHA reminders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/upa-too-tried-to-give-bsf-sweeping-powers/articleshow/87032621.cms||Bharti Jain

---||India||At SCO meet, Rajnath cites Indira as nari shakti example||NEW DELHI: Stressing that India had a ‘very positive experience’ in harnessing women power for national development, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday cited the example of former PM Indira Gandhi leading the country in times of peace and war for several years. Addressing an international Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) seminar on the role of women in the armed forces, Singh said their wider contribution in all spheres of security and nation-building must also be recognised and reinforced. “India’s former PM Indira Gandhi not only led the country for a number of years, she also did so during the times of war. And more recently, Pratibha Patil was the President of India and the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces,” the minister said. “There are a number of examples of women taking up arms to protect their country and the rights of the people through history. Rani Laxmi Bai is amongst the most revered and respected amongst them,” he added. Noting that Indian customs and traditions revered women as both caregivers and protecters, Singh said, “If Saraswati is our Goddess of knowledge, wisdom and learning, Mother Durga remains associated with protection, strength, destruction and war.” India is among the very few countries that took an early initiative in terms of women's participation in the armed forces. “Women are now also being accepted for permanent commission in the armed forces and shall be commanding Army units and battalions in the near future… We have taken the evolutionary path of moving from support to combat support and thereafter, to combat arms within the armed forces,” the minister said. “We have found that the process of induction, given its broad-based and progressive path, has also simultaneously prepared the society and the armed forces for this change. This is an important aspect to ensure a smooth and successful transition,” he added. Girl cadets will also be able to join the premier tri-Service National Defence Academy from next year onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-sco-meet-rajnath-cites-indira-as-nari-shakti-example/articleshow/87032980.cms||---
---||Business||RBI: India on verge of shift to capital a/c convertibility||MUMBAI: India is on the cusp of a fundamental shift toward capital account convertibility by increasing integration of offshore and onshore markets and allowing non-residents freer access to debt markets, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor T Rabi Sankar has said. According to him, there is a need to review the limits under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) that allows Indians to send up to $250,000 abroad annually, keeping in mind the needs of higher education and startups. The deputy governor’s statement on moving ahead on convertibility comes at a time when the country is seeing huge capital inflows through foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) and foreign direct investments (FDIs), including private equity funding of startups. Statements in support of convertibility are seen as signs of confidence on the external front as, typically, the RBI has eased capital restrictions so that overseas investments can counterbalance inflows. “There is an effort to liberalise FPI debt flows further with the introduction of the fully accessible route (FAR), which places no limit on non-resident investment in specified benchmark securities. Since over time, virtually all securities will fall under the FAR category, the move is unambiguously towards eventual unfettered access for non-residents into government securities,” said Sankar, speaking at the 5th annual day of the Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India (FEDAI) on Thursday. Sankar said that debt flows to government securities (G-secs) are likely to increase after limits are raised. “Efforts to get India included under global bond indexes and the complementary move towards placing G-secs under global custodians, once implemented, will encourage debt flows in future,” he said. For resident Indians, the amount of capital they can send is limited under the LRS. “As the LRS has operated for some time, there may be a need to review it, keeping in mind the changing requirements such as higher education for the youth, the requirement of startups, etc. There might even be a case for reviewing whether the limit can remain uniform or can be linked to some economic variable for individuals,” said Sankar. Indians have been sending an average of $1.5 billion every month until the pandemic for various purposes including education, travel and maintenance of relatives. This dropped to an average $1 billion last year due to the pandemic and has again inched up to $1.2 billion on average in the first quarter. According to Sankar, foreigners holding substantial debt holdings might make India vulnerable to the risk of sudden reversals. However, this risk is reduced if India is part of global indices. “There is a natural safety mechanism as index investors are unlikely to indulge in sudden reversals. It may need to be considered, from a macroprudential perspective, whether the ‘fully accessible route’ should be linked to index inclusion,” said Sankar. The deputy governor said that banks should prepare themselves to manage the business process changes and the global risks associated with capital convertibility. He said that the job of the regulator was limited. “The job of a regulator is like the gas regulator in the kitchen — it cannot ensure the quality of the dish, but it can prevent the kitchen from blowing up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-india-on-verge-of-shift-to-capital-a/c-convertibility/articleshow/87028980.cms||---

However, residents have alleged improper fogging in their area. On Thursday, 25 new dengue cases were reported, taking the total to 254 in the district so far. Citizen Welfare Association (CWA) president S K Nayar said they attended the meeting with Dr Mukta Kumar, chief medical officer on September 27 in her office. During the meeting, the CMO described safety measures to be taken to protect residents. She had also emphasised the need for fogging every 14 days. Residents alleged that despite these guidelines, fogging was not being done properly. The MC has one large and four small fogging machines. Fogging is conducted on the directions of the health department and the officer in-charge of the fogging drive is Kuldip Malik, executive officer, Panchkula MC. Residents alleged that fogging was either not being done or being done in an improper manner. “The fogging team comes and goes hastily. It seems they are only doing it as a formality,” Nayar alleged. He also alleged that officials were not providing proper medicine and diesel to fogging machine operators. A fogging machine broke down in Sector 15 for want of diesel and the vehicle remained stranded for long, he said. Kamlesh Lohat, president, House Owner Welfare Association, Sector 19, said, “We have to approach the department time and again to make sure fogging is done in our area, Sector 20.” The CWA president wrote a letter to DC Vinay Pratap Singh, MC commissioner Dharamvir Singh and CMO Dr Mukta Kumar about this. Health department officials maintained that fogging was being conducted in affected areas regularly. They also said that source reduction activities are being conducted on a routine basis and awareness drives were being organised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-fear-lax-fogging-may-jack-up-cases/articleshow/87029093.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The court recently ordered National Insurance Company Ltd to pay the treatment expenses amounting to Rs 33,820 to the complainant Ashish Bhatt along with 9% interest and a compensation of Rs 10,000, as the insurance company could not substantiate its claim that Bhatt’s condition was due to nutritional deficiency. Bhatt had approached consumer court in August 2015 as the third-party administrator on behalf of the insurance company had rejected his claim stating that treatment related to nutritional deficiency is not payable as per the terms and conditions of the health insurance policy. The insurance firm had also stated that anaemia is a nutritional deficiency in the claim rejection letter. Bhatt was admitted to a private hospital in Nizampura for five days in May 2015 for problems related to his condition. Bhatt, in his complaint, had told the court that the insurance company never gave him a copy of the policy’s terms and conditions. The court upheld the argument that the copy of terms and conditions was never given to Bhatt, but also drew attention that it cannot be assumed that anaemic condition was due to nutritional deficiency or by not having proper food. “The insurance company should have proven its stand on nutritional deficiency by providing a doctor’s opinion and nutritional deficiency cannot be the only reason for anaemia. So, the insurance company has taken the decision of rejecting the claim by going beyond its power and the TPA on behalf of the insurance company too has decided things based on assumption,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/anaemia-not-just-diet-deficiency/articleshow/87027677.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Ahmedabad||No intention of changing sitting MLAs in 2022: C R Paatil||GANDHINAGAR: Days after creating ripples in the state BJP by stating that at least hundred new faces will be given tickets in next year’s assembly elections, Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil clarified on Thursday that there is no move to replace sitting MLAs en masse. “The party has 112 MLAs in the 182-member assembly, which means we will have to look for 70 candidates on those seats which we have not won. Also, there will be a few MLAs who will retire. In that sense, the BJP will have to look for about100 new faces. There is no move to change existing MLAs,” Paatil clarified. He added, “I had told party workers that there is a likelihood of new faces. If you work diligently in your respective areas, and if the people endorse you, there is a possibility of you being selected.” Speaking at a party function in Himmatnagar earlier this week, Paatil told the gathering, which included MLAs and ministers, that there would be 100 new faces in the 2022 election. “I am saying this to elected representatives, leaders, chairmen of various bodies and ministers who are seated here – give priority to party workers. If there are complaints from party workers, it will be accounted for,” warned Paatil,who added that the BJP has been winning because of the workers. The BJP has 112 seats in the 182-seat Gujarat assembly. The opposition Congress has 65 seats, Bharatiya Tribal Party has two, Nationalist Congress Party has one seat, one seat is vacant and an MLA Jignesh Mevani will be contesting the next election on a Congress ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-intention-of-changing-sitting-mlas-in-2022-paatil/articleshow/87029091.cms||---

---||Business||Pine Labs forays into processing of e-payments||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Pine Labs has made a major play in the online payments space by launching Plural Gateway and a suite of products that will help retailers collect money online. Some of the top retailers — Croma, Reliance, Samsung and Apple resellers — have signed up with Pine Labs for online payments. “The online payments space has been dominated by very few players. Given our strength in offline space and the aspirations of retailers to go online and provide credit products to customers, we feel there is a big opportunity for us here, ” said Pine Labs CEO Amrish Rau. In its beta phase, the company has been processing Rs 1,500 crore of online payments every month and expects to see this number go up to Rs 15,000 crore in 18 months. “Earlier, there were only a few dominant merchants in every segment — whether it was e-commerce, travel, education or any other. Now every vendor and service provider is realising the need to provide their own online platform for customers,” said Rau. Besides retailers, Pine Labs is expecting big growth in payments to governments and government bodies. “Here we are partnered with several of the banks that have government accounts and have received the mandate to onboard the government departments for online,” said Rau. Pine Labs, which dominated the offline merchant space, has been working on an offline-to-online strategy and had raised $600 million in funding in July 2021. India’s online boom has pushed up valuations of online processors with BillDesk, a pioneer in online payments processing, being purchased by PayU for $4.7 billion. Besides the gateway, Pine Labs is offering merchants Plural Checkout, and Plural Console. The gateway allows acceptance of payments via 100+ modes, including Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) transactions. Plural Checkout is a mobile SDK (software development kit) that boosts payments gateway performance for smartphones. Plural Console is a payments orchestration platform (POP) that offers a single-tech framework to trigger transactions via multiple payments gateways. “In addition to the tech stack, merchants are also looking for hand-holding from their service providers. The advantage we bring is that, due to our offline presence, we have 700 people to assist merchants,” said Rau. One reason why Pine Labs has been able to make big in-roads within a short period is the new RBI regulations that required increased tech capability from payments gateways. “There is also a big opportunity arising out of regulations requiring two-factor authentication for recurring payments and more secure methods of enabling one-click payments without storing card details. Many merchants are looking for new service providers,” said Rau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pine-labs-forays-into-processing-of-e-payments/articleshow/87028653.cms||Mayur Shetty

In his order passed on Wednesday, Pilarnkar stated that since there were only 7 councillors out of the 15-member council, the motion could not seek a majority. He said it was necessary that eight members should have been present for the special meeting to vote on the motion. It was perhaps the first incident in the 5-decade-old history of PMC that the civic body approached the DMA to decide on the outcome of a no-trust motion moved against the vice-chairperson Virendra Dhavlikar on Monday. Chairperson Shantaram Kolvenkar had earlier stated that the no-confidence motion against Dhavlikar was passed by 7-0 votes as the opposition members remained absent. Archana Dangui, councillor from Shantinagar ward who was a signatory to the motion, also remained absent during the special meeting held to discuss and vote on the no-trust. Eight councillors of the 15-member body, including Archana Dangui, Chandrakala Naik, Venkatesh Naik, Seema Fernandes, Shantaram Kolvenkar, Jaya Sawant, Amina Naik and Geetali Talaulikar had served the notice against Dhavlikar on September 4. The BJP-led Ponda Nagrik Samiti had rewarded Virendra Dhavlikar with the post of PMC deputy chairperson on October 21 last. Orally it was decided that he would vacate the chair in six months and allow other colleagues an opportunity to become the vice-chairperson. However, he did not vacate the chair for about a year, following which the motion was moved. Dhavlikar had joined BJP-backed Ponda Nagrik Samiti on October 2 after defecting from MGP’s Rising Ponda panel. He was instrumental in ousting councillor Amina Naik by a margin of 8-4 votes on October 13, 2020 from the deputy chairman’s post.

The sensex has recorded a new high every day of the holiday-shortened week, gaining over 1,200 points in four sessions. The broader Nifty, which crossed the 18k milestone on Monday, also hit a new closing high at 18,339, gaining 177 points (1%) on Thursday. IT stocks joined the rally, which was led by auto, energy, metals and financial sectors this week, bolstered by better-than-expected Q2 results for Wipro and Infosys. Depreciation of the rupee, which fell below 75 against the dollar this week, too supported the rally in IT stocks, according to market players. A combination of macroeconomic factors, global cues and strong earnings has supported the bullish momentum on Dalal Street, market analysts said. Investors are also expecting strong sales for carmakers in the festive season, which has led to the auto sector being the top gainer, rising nearly 7%, this week. “Markets are in a festive mood and witnessing faster sector rotation. IT was in limelight after strong numbers from Infosys, Wipro and Mindtree. The earning season has started on a strong note and needs to continue delivering strong numbers for the market to sustain the current momentum,” said Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 22 closed in the green on Thursday, with ITC, HDFC Bank and PowerGrid being the top gainers. The HDFC twins and ICICI Bank alone contributed 364 points to the sensex’s 569-point sprint on Thursday. Foreign investors were net buyers with Rs 1,596 crore inflows on Thursday, according to NSDL data. “The market continued its bull run as worries about the likely interest rate hike in the US at a later stage and rising bond yields tempered,” said Kotak Securities head (equity research - retail) Shrikant Chouhan. The market capitalisation of the BSE too hit a fresh high at Rs 275 lakh crore, with investor wealth increasing by Rs 2 lakh crore on Thursday. India’s market cap ($3.5 trillion) is also set to overtake that of the UK’s $3.6 trillion to become the fifth-highest ranked country in terms of value of listed companies. India had recently crossed France’s market cap ($3.2 trillion) to rank sixth. The sensex’s latest milestone came in just 14 sessions after it first crossed the 60k mark. Market watchers expect the momentum to continue. “The sensex may hit 70,000 by the end of the year riding on improving earnings, tax collection, opening up of the economy and rising retail participation,” said Manoj Dalmia, founder and chairman of brokerage firm Proficient Equities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-goes-past-61k-as-festive-mood-grips-d-st/articleshow/87029180.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Some will be happy with my suicide’||AHMEDABAD: A 41-year-old woman living in Shailraj Bungalows society in the Satellite area of city on Thursday committed suicide by hanging herself in the house after a prolonged fight with her in-laws over “detention of her husband” and also over property dispute, said police officers. Krupa Patel, mother of two daughters, aged 22 and 16, was found hanging by her younger daughter Yana who informed police about her death, said inspector J B Agrawat of Satellite police. He said that there were various reasons which might have led to the suicide, but she didn’t mention anything in her suicide note. Police recovered her body found hanging with ceiling fan on the second floor of the house and sent it for postmortem examination. Sources in police said that her elder daughter Devanshi has been staying in the US and her father-in-law C P Patel was a retired collector. In her suicide note, she said, “I wish that all remain happy. I know that too many persons will be very happy with my suicide and some will be very sad.” She added, “One thing is definite that Devanshi and Yana will become orphan after my death as they would lose both mother and father. So, my land located in Telav and Khodiyar should be handed over to my daughters.” Addressing her father-in-law, she said, “CP Pappaji, this was the last wish of your Chirag and his wife that our daughters should remain very happy in their life like your daughters Kavita and Parul. If you do that, my soul will get peace.” On her parents, Krupa said, “Please take care of my parents, I was their only daughter who would not be alive very soon.” Addressing her mother-in-law, she says in the suicide note, “Thanks Neeru Mummy, this is your birthday gift from my side. This is Kavita’s happiness also and perhaps yours too.” Krupa had in November 2019 filed a petition before the Gujarat high court pleading to bring to court her husband, who has lost his memory following an accident in December 2018. In her petition, Krupa had claimed that her in-laws have detained her husband, Chirag Patel, who is in no condition to take any decision on his own now with up to 95% memory loss due to injuries that he sustained in an accident that occurred on December 31, 2018. She complained that her in-laws do not permit her and her daughters to meet Chirag. Krupa had in 2018 and 2019 tried to file an FIR with the Satellite police on two occasions with regard to criminal intimidation and harassment at her house by her in-laws, but her applications were never converted in FIRs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/some-will-be-happy-with-my-suicide/articleshow/87029189.cms||---

The court adjourned to October 26 his petition for extension of his medical bail and permission to shift to his residence in Hyderabad. He made the plea through senior counsel Anand Grover, citing ill health and high expenses in Mumbai. Rao, arrested in 2018, was granted medical bail by the HC on February 22 for six months. The court had said he would have to either surrender or seek another extension based on his health condition after six months. A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal could not hear Rao’s plea due to paucity of time, and said that it will hear the same later this month. However, it extended the time for him to surrender till October 28. An earlier interim order had given him time to surrender till October 14. Rao, 81, in his petition said that he continues to suffer from various ailments that require treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-varavara-rao-gets-time-till-october-28-to-surrender/articleshow/87031152.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Visarjan of Goddess idols today after Sindoor Khela||MUMBAI: Friday’s Dussehra brings the curtains over the festival of Sharadiya Navratra. Visarjan of the Goddess’ idol will be conducted following civic norms. This year, ‘Ravan dahan’, burning of Ravan’s effigy, will not take place at Ramlila grounds due to Covid rules. Temples will end the 10-day ‘Ramayan paath’ with the coronation or ‘tilak’ of Lord Ram. Durga Puja pandals organised Kumari Puja at Navami on Thursday, where a little girl is dressed as the goddess and worshipped like her. On Dussehra, they will immerse the Devi’s idol after the dazzling Sindoor Khela ceremony. The Kumari Puja is conducted at a few pandals like Ramakrishna Mission and Bengal Club. Navi Mumbai has a few instances too. Seven-year-old Ishani Arun was the cynosure of all eyes at the Kumari Puja of the Koparkhairane Bengali Association. Her parents Arunava and Paromita Khan wondered whether their little daughter would sit patiently through the ceremony. Paromita said, “But we were so surprised as Ishani enjoyed the Puja thoroughly. The priest sprinkled holy water over her, recited mantras, washed her feet, gifted her a sari and items of adornment, then fed her sweets and water, just as we do for Goddess Durga.” Ishani was most delighted when the women of the pandal arrived to seek her blessings, because they plied her with generous gifts of chocolate, soft toys and cash which eventually amounted to Rs 2,670. “She is sitting with her elder sister and counting and she is absolutely elated,” laughed Paromita. Meanwhile, at the Durga temple in Sundar Nagar, Malad, the 40-year-old Ramlila Prachar Samiti will stage the final recitation of the Ramayan paath. “Our Ramlila would draw 15,000 spectators to the vast ground on Dussehra day,” said organiser Devkinandan Jindal. “But since that was truncated, we continue the tradition by reciting the Ramayan before 100 people in a small shrine.” His son Raman Jindal said, “Ramayan paath is seen as a spiritual experience as recitation from the holy book takes precedence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-visarjan-of-goddess-idols-today-after-sindoor-khela/articleshow/87031159.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde’s election set aside as null and void||MUMBAI: In a setback to BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde, a small causes court set aside his 2017 election as null and void on Thursday. He was elected from ward number 106 in Mulund in the polls held on February 21, 2017. The court, on a request by the BMC and Shinde’s lawyers, granted a stay of four weeks to enable the corporator to appeal. Advocate Jeet Gandhi later said Shinde would file a petition before the Bombay high court against the order. In a judgment pronounced in the open court, an additional chief judge of the small causes court in Dhobi Talao allowed an election petition filed by a resident, Bhargav Kadam. Shinde’s election was challenged primarily on the basis that the returning officer had not signed the nomination form, said his legal team. Shinde’s lawyer had argued that signing on the nomination form is the duty of the returning officer. He argued that even if he failed to fulfil his duty, the elected candidate cannot be punished for the act of the returning officer. Shinde’s other submission was that the person challenging the election victory was neither a candidate nor a voter of his constituency and therefore had no locus — right to be heard — to file the election petition. “I will soon file a petition before the HC,” Shinde said after the judgment. A statement from Shinde said: “After accepting the application of the candidate in the election process, after scrutinising the application, it is learnt that the returning officer did not sign the application and only for this reason the election process was cancelled.” Shinde was with the Shiv Sena before he joined the BJP close to the 2017 BMC election. The court order was a setback to the BJP since Shinde is the party’s group leader in the BMC. The order has come just months before the BMC election is due in February. Shinde said: “The candidate has no right to check whether it is signed by the returning officer or not. It is the responsibility of the State Election Commission and the administration to complete the election process and announce the decision in the gazette. Candidates cannot interfere in it. Senior legal experts are of the opinion that it would not be appropriate to punish a candidate after four and a half years. A third party had filed the petition only for political reasons. But there is no doubt that we will get justice in the high court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-corporators-election-set-aside-as-null-and-void/articleshow/87031179.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Pune||Pune: One held for bid to sell employer’s vehicle online||PUNE: A driver was arrested this week for trying to sell his Bengaluru-based former employer’s new sports utility vehicle on an online portal. A Pimpri Chinchwad resident finalised a deal for Rs25 lakh. The driver, posing as the seller, said he would deliver the vehicle on Tuesday. The buyer grew suspicious as the vehicle had no registration number, and told Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash. A crime branch team led by assistant inspector Harish Mane laid a trap at Tathawade on Tuesday and took the driver, Chetan Mhetre (26) of Bidar district in Karnataka, into custody along with the SUV. During questioning Mhetre admitted to his involvement in stealing the car. Assistant inspector Mane said that two months ago, Mhetre’s former employer had purchased a new SUV. Mhetre quit working for him just before that. “The owner wanted a special registration number, so he had not registered it,” said Mane. Mane said Mhetre, who needed money, hatched a plot to steal the SUV. “He had taken photographs and put it up for sale. For the past two months, he had been dealing with different customers,” Mane said. He said that on October 10, Mhetre took the SUV’s key from the former employer’s wife on some pretext and drove the vehicle to Pune. “The employer had filed a case against Mhetre,” Mane said, adding that Mhetre and the SUV were handed over to the Bengaluru police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-held-for-bid-to-sell-employers-vehicle-online/articleshow/87029141.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Row over who cleared new BEST AC bus service fares||MUMBAI: A controversy erupted after it emerged that BEST Undertaking had not taken Mumbai Metropolitan Region Transport Authority’s (MMRT-A) nod before finalizing fares for point-to-point services between airport-Gateway of India and airport-BKC. Both these point-to-point air-conditioned services were inaugurated by Mumbai city’s guardian minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray on Sunday. Congress leader Ravi Raja said, “BEST administration should have got the fares approved by MMRTA. BEST usually gets its fares approved by MMRTA. It is surprising why it did not approach them this time The fares are also exorbitant.” The service started on Tuesday. For the airport-BKC service, the fare is Rs75, while for the airport-Gateway of India the fare is Rs175. The fare from airport is Rs125 to Nehru Planetarium in Worli and Rs150 to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). BEST member and BJP leader Sunil Ganacharya said, “BEST has been given permission for stage carriage by RTA, so they must take permission from them before introducing point-to-point services and fares. Such services in the past have failed due to poor demand. This was introduced to show Aaditya in good light. But this is done at the cost of regular passengers who have been denied services due to lack of buses.” BEST GM Lokesh Chandra said for point-point services, fares were approved by BEST committee and BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-row-over-who-cleared-new-best-ac-bus-service-fares/articleshow/87031199.cms||---

Top state government officials said they have not yet heard from the airline SpiceJet, whose 100% subsidiary, SpiceShuttle, operates the seaplane service connecting Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad and the Statue of Unity in Kevadia. “The service was expected to resume in September this year. However, we have not yet heard from the airline regarding resumption of service as yet,” said a state government source privy to the development. “SpiceJet is in talks with a manufacturer to buy an aircraft. These processes take time and therefore, we are not sure whether and when the new aircraft will be procured and operationalised for the service,” said a source. An email query sent to SpiceJet went unanswered. The service has remained suspended for 244 days since its inauguration on October 31, 2020. The seaplane aircraft was brought for operations to India on lease by SpiceJet. Sources confirmed that the aircraft is currently in Maldives and is yet to be brought back. Seaplane flights connecting Ahmedabad and Kevadia were suspended earlier this year just ahead of the second wave of Covid-19 infections. This is the second major suspension of the seaplane service. The first one was within a month of its operations in November-end 2020, when the aircraft was sent for a thorough maintenance to Maldives, for lack of a wet and dry dock which is required for the aircraft’s maintenance here. Two round-trip flights from Ahmedabad to Kevadia were operating when the service had resumed. The seaplane aircraft has thus far taken some 284 flights and ferried some 2,458 passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/seaplane-may-not-fly-on-1st-anniversary/articleshow/87029237.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Delhi||Two Delhi Police personnel held for aiding Gogi gang||NEW DELHI: The hit squad that had arrived in the city to avenge the killing of gangster Jitender Gogi in a Rohini court was being assisted by two Delhi Police personnel. These cops have been arrested, sources told TOI on Thursday. They are likely to be dismissed from service by police commissioner Rakesh Asthana. On October 3, Delhi Police’s Special Cell had arrested four shooters sent by an “alliance” of jailed gangsters. One of the shooters, Anuj, had a Rs 2.2 lakh reward on his head, while the other, Sagar Rana, had a Rs one lakh bounty. The other two, Harsh and Sumit, had a reward of Rs 75,000 and 50,000, respectively. Nine pistols, including an American Taurus, Turkish Zigana and Chinese Star, apart from 123 cartridges and two cars were seized from them. During interrogation, the accused revealed the identity of two constables who had helped them with logistics. “While constable Deepak was posted at Sarojini Nagar police station, constable Sunil was with the security unit,” said a source in the protective security wing. “When the shooters arrived in the city, the two cops helped them find accommodation. They were in constant communication through secure platforms,” added the source. Investigation revealed that the two policemen were hand in glove with Gogi and his associates and had even committed crimes. During questioning, they disclosed their involvement in a cash robbery case, which they had committed with the gang in Haryana in 2019. A probe is being conducted to ascertain if they were involved in more crimes, including the Rohini Courts Complex shootout. The incident has prompted the Delhi Police brass to order all units to identify more such bad sheep in their units. Asthana, who recently deployed a dedicated inspector and ACP for each court in the city, has instructed all DCPs and special commissioners to have a zero tolerance policy towards such elements. The shooters were tasked to carry out gang wars over the next few weeks. On the target was gangster Sunil Tajpuria, apart from the henchmen of his associates who helped him kill Gogi. The hit squad was working on the instructions of Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar, who was coordinating with Lawrence Bishnoi, Kala Jathedi and Gogi’s deputy Deepak Teetar, who is in jail. The hitmen, who were involved in over 20 murders and 30 cases of extortion, robbery and carjacking, were on the run after killing a gangster in Punjab two days before their arrest by Delhi Police. A senior officer said the Gogi gang had formed an alliance with Jathedi, Bishnoi, Sampat Nehra, Ashok Pradhan and Hashim Baba. The Tillu gang was supported by Neeraj Bawana, Sunil Rathee, Naveen Bali and Nasir. The shooters belonged to the Gogi-Bishnoi faction. They had also planned to kill shooters of Bawana and Bali gangs, including Monu Bajitpuriya, Vishal Maan and Naresh Tajpuriya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-policemen-held-for-aiding-gogi-gang/articleshow/87031212.cms||Raj Shekhar

The draft rules were issued in August this year. In its submission before the state labour commissioner, WPC said the draft rules are not clear on timeline to set up the social security board, appointments and representation of workers’ bodies to the board, exemption of employers’ contribution, workers’ data privacy, setting up of mandatory workers’ facilitation centres, and helpline for the unorganised sector. The organisation welcomed the inclusion of gig workers, special provisions for maintaining record of women workers, but demanded that the government look at social security as defined by the International Labour Organisation. It pointed out that the draft rules impose an age limit for informal workers to be eligible. “These provisions are likely to narrow the pool of workers who can avail benefits,” it warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-draft-rules-on-social-security-lack-clarity/articleshow/87031215.cms||---

Registration will be done from 8am to 11am on payment of Rs 10 per registration. It was on September 10 that the UT health department provided the facility of OPD registration for GMSH-16 at the e-Sampark centre in Sector 15. Now, the facility will be provided at e-Sampark centres in sectors 10, 15, 40, 43, Industrial Area Phase-I, Dhanas, Mauli Jagran, Bapu Dham colony, Manimajra and Maloya. UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said that efforts are being made to provide OPD registration facility for GMCH-32 and PGI at e-Sampark Centers too but this would take more time. To encourage online registration for OPD, a separate counter has been provided at GMSH-16 for issuance of bar-coded OPD card. After online registration, patients may get the OPD card from a special counter, he said. He also clarified that the existing system of free walk-in registration at GMSH-16 will also remain available without any change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/10-e-sampark-centers-to-provide-opd-registration-for-gmsh-16-from-oct-18/articleshow/87029239.cms||---

According to Vineet Agarwal, national president, Assocham, fuel must be brought under the ambit of GST so that industries can take the benefit of input tax credit. “Bringing fuel under the ambit of GST will let industries claim input tax credit and this in turn will ease the cost pressures. We hope the GST Council soon takes a decision as it will go a long way in improving the ease of doing business,” said Agarwal. He was in Gandhinagar on Thursday as part of a high-level delegation to meet Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel to discuss the recent developments in the state's economy & policy.

---||Ahmedabad||Covid cases double in five days in Gujarat, spike higher than Maharashtra||AHMEDABAD: Call it the effect of Navratri swirl -- Gujarat has recorded a sharp spike in Covid cases during the festivities. From 18 on October 10, the daily cases almost doubled to 34 on Thursday – recording an 88% spike in five days. The rate was higher than Maharashtra and Kerala – two of the worst-affected states that recorded a rise of 4% and 17% during the same period. However, the spike is not the only worrisome trend Gujarat has witnessed – at 34, it was the highest daily cases in 82 days. While the deadly second wave was waning, the state had recorded 30 cases on July 27 while on July 24, the state had 39 cases. Moreover, the active cases crossed 200 after August 6 when the state had 206 active cases. At 215, it was 71-day high for the state. Analysis of the five-day cases reveal that the state recorded 121 cases at the average of 24.2, higher than the October average of 22 daily cases as the state has so far recorded 308 cases. The month in turn has also recorded higher daily cases compared to September, which just had 514 cases in 30 days at the average of 17 cases. Moreover, the cases have remained clustered around specific districts. Out of 121 cases since October 10, 62 or 50% of the cases were from Surat city (20) and district (9), Valsad (23), Navsari (8) and Narmada (2). Moreover, 23% of the cases (28) were recorded from Ahmedabad city. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the city-based private hospitals are witnessing a rise in cases, even as the number has remained below 10 for the past few days. “On Thursday, the city hospitals had seven patients out of which two were in ICU. The cases have started rising during the festivities. While it may be difficult to directly attribute the rise to the festival, it’s surely a warning sign not to let our guards down and follow Covid safety protocols,” he said. State health department officials said that they are keeping a close eye on the passenger movement and inter-state movement especially in the south Gujarat that is recording a steady rise in cases. “The numbers have shown cyclical movement and it may also come down soon, but districts with high growth rate have been alerted for necessary action. Three districts – Surat, Valsad and Ahmedabad – have 40-plus active cases,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-cases-double-in-five-days-in-gujarat-spike-higher-than-maha/articleshow/87028758.cms||Parth Shastri

Addressing a gathering after performing the bhoomi-puja of the National Forensic Science University at Dharbandora, Shah said lack of trained experts in forensic science was leading to an increase in pendency of criminal cases in courts. To ensure forensic investigation is made mandatory for such crimes, Shah said it was necessary to set up forensic laboratories in over 600 districts and to provide a mobile forensic van at the level of every police subdivision. As this requires availability of at least 40,000 forensic scientists, Shah said the National Forensic Science University has been established to provide education in various disciplines of forensic science to students that would provide them assured placement. Shah urged Goa CM Pramod Sawant to popularise forensic science among school students. “Just as a large number of sailors come from Goa, let Goa also produce large number of forensic scientists over the next 10 years,” he said. Shah said apart from providing forensic education to students, the forensic university will also conduct diploma courses for police officers, judicial officers, people related to cyber security and security personnel of private companies. He also asked the university authorities to formulate courses related to tourist safety, coastal policing, drugs and narcotics control, among others in the interest of Goa’s tourism sector. He said it would also effectively control the law and order situation. Shah said the forensic university was first conceived by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was the CM of Gujarat. “Modi worked to begin the first forensic field university in the whole world and when he became the PM, he established the National Forensic Science University,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-plans-to-make-forensic-probe-must-for-offences-carrying-6-year-jail-term-shah/articleshow/87033022.cms||---

The matter is being probed from all possible angles, senior police officers said. “A police team that reached the spot found that a pregnant woman—Sakshi Sharma (26)—had been admitted to the hospital on Tuesday. On Wednesday, during her operation, the baby was born as dead. Upon knowing this, family members and relatives of the patient got into a heated argument and quarrel with doctors in the hospital alleging that it was due to their negligence that the baby died. They even damaged a few properties at the hospital during the altercation,” said a senior police officer. The body of the baby was then shifted to BSA Hospital for a postmortem examination and further opinion. “Meanwhile, a written complaint was given by doctor Kanti Shamsukha alleging that some members of the patient’s family misbehaved, thrashed the doctors and even tried to cause damage to the hospital property. Our team also received medical report of the child from BSA Hospital, which stated the nature of injury as simple,” the officer said. Therefore, based on the complaint of the doctor and medical reports of the deceased child, a case under sections of assault and other related ones, including those of the Delhi medicare service, person and medicare institution (prevention of violence and damage of property) Act 2008, was registered against a few members of the family. “The probe is in progress and all possible angles are being looked into,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/relatives-target-hosp-staff-after-newborn-dies/articleshow/87031249.cms||---

The bandh was to protest farmer deaths in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Sujay Patki, vice-president of Thane district, who filed the PIL said, “There seems to be no valid rationale seen for parties that run the state to misuse the government machinery to support such protests, especially at a time when traders and daily wage earners are suffering losses. Political activists were seen damaging public and private property.” The party has also questioned if the government that has disallowed festivity in the state fearing Covid infection has failed to see its own activists failing to toe the protocol while enforcing the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-pil-in-high-court-over-states-bandh-against-farm-violence/articleshow/87031270.cms||---

Gupta said the party functionaries would be holding dialogue with people living in various slums during the course of ‘Jhuggi Yatra,’ which will be starting from Moti Nagar. "We will be talking to head of the jhuggis, women besides other people there, listen to their problems like that of water, sewer and other basic infrastructural problems, and try to resolve them to their satisfaction," he further added. Bidhuri said the central government had brought many schemes to make the lives of the poor better. "There are around 700 slums in the capital where around 20 lakh people stay. We want to make their lives better. The Narendra Modi government has provided various schemes for them like Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, Ujjawala Yojna and PM Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi. We will help them get the benefits of these schemes," he stated. Bidhuri claimed that the AAP government had promised rehabilitation to slum dwellers when it came to power, but it was not fulfilled. "Thousands of slum dwellers do not have ration cards and they are also not getting the ration meant for poor people without ration cards," the BJP functionary said. Gupta said the AAP government made many promises to slum dwellers, but it failed to take any concrete step to fulfill them. "Our aim is to give slum dwellers an identity and respect," he claimed. In the first leg of the yatra, we will be covering 33 assembly constituencies between October 15 and November 29, said Delhi BJP media head Naveen Kumar Jindal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/poll-prep-bjp-to-begin-jhuggi-yatra/articleshow/87031267.cms||---

This has been causing unforeseen hardships to daily commuters, who are now negotiating with broken lids of water channels, water seepage and constant slow movement of traffic. The most recent renovations were carried out in March and April this year, following which the underpass was thrown open for vehicles. Work of resurfacing the entire patch and repairs of channels were carried out by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). No additional expenses were incurred for the works as the repairs were done under the defect liability period. But now, regular commuters have said that the time has come to re-initiate repairs. Alok Hole, who uses this road frequently, said that besides repairs of potholes or rough surfaces, the water channels also needed to be cleaned regularly to curb overflow of water onto the carriageway. “Since the underpass has gradients from both sides, water gets accumulated in the bottom portion. Adequate provisions should be made to clear this overflow,” said Hole. Smita Dani, a bank employee who is another regular on this route, said that the cement slabs near the iron covers on water channels have broken at many places. “These spots have become very risky as they are not visible. Riders in particular face immense difficulties. The iron rods or covers of water channels are visible at many spots since the cement or tar fixed over them has disappeared,” said Dani. Ashok Raut, an autorickshaw driver, said water is seeping out from the retaining wall of the underpass and flowing onto the carriageway. “It is very risky for two-wheelers as chances of bikes skidding on the gradient cannot be ruled out,” Raut highlighted. MSRDC officials said concreting work was not done here because of rains, and repairs would be initiated soon. Meanwhile, officials from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said would conduct an inspection of all these spots and take up the necessary repairs jointly with MSRDC. “The underpass witnesses heavy traffic of vehicles so chances of deterioration are higher. We will replace the existing lids of chambers or channels with bigger ones if required,” added officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/swargate-underpass-in-disrepair-once-again/articleshow/87029394.cms||Sarang Dastane

The party is likely to once again pitch its ‘Karun Dakhavla’ (We’ve done it) campaign. Thackeray will likely to showcase the various development works carried out in Mumbai by the BMC between 2017 and 2022. Thackeray is also expected to take on the BJP on multiple issues, from state to national politics. “Over the last two years, some people who did not have any other work, have only been creating drama. A befitting reply will be given to this. The Shiv Sena chief will speak on national and state politics and development in the state, among other issues. We have to burn the Ravana of the rising fuel prices in 2024. We will start this with tomorrow’s Ravana dahana,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, referring to the ritual of burning effigies of demon king Ravana on Dussehra. This year, the Shiv Sena will hold its annual rally indoors at Sion’s Shanmukhananda Hall with 50% capacity, keeping Covid-19 protocols in mind.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal to map food truck policy as distribution halted||MUMBAI: With the Shiv Sena miffed over the BMC circular to stop distribution of food trucks, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has called a meeting next week to discuss and formulate a comprehensive policy for not just their distribution but also eligibility, location and the cost involved. Last week, in a setback to a chunk of Shiv Sena corporators, the BMC had stayed distribution of food trucks as freebies by corporators ahead of next year’s BMC elections. The BMC’s planning department recently issued a circular directing all wards to not distribute any food trucks bought from the BMC funds, citing lack of a comprehensive policy for them in the city. “The BMC chief has called for a meeting on October 20 of officials from all the concerned departments to discuss the food truck policy. The previously made draft policy prepared by the health department will also be discussed,” said a senior civic official. The circular stated the food trucks are part of a new citywide policy. “This policy deals with the health department, removal of encroachment department, roads department, traffic police and Mumbai police. So it is needed to make a comprehensive policy by taking inputs from all these departments. This will help in making this policy if a meeting is held at the level of the municipal commissioner along with these departments. After taking views of all these departments, a draft policy will be placed before the civic group leaders and general body,” the planning department’s circular stated. “All ward officers are hereby requested that till a detailed food truck policy is approved and rolled out, no decision should be taken about the distribution of food trucks at the ward level,”it stated. Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav has already bought 30 food trucks for Rs 5 crore for his constituency in Byculla. Jadhav has said food trucks were distributed since 2019 and termed the circular as “bad in law and arbitrary... In the past two years, food trucks were distributed as per policy. The circular is violating the rights of corporators. They should have allowed distribution of the already ordered food trucks and implemented the circular from next year”. The BJP has demanded till a policy is rolled out, the trucks already distributed should be taken back by the BMC since they are now being run illegally. “There is a lot of ambiguity on whether the policy is for food trucks or vegetable vans. We also don’t know what the eligibility criteria is to get these trucks. The policy must answer all the questions. Thirty trucks are already distributed in Byculla by Shiv Sena. The BMC should take them back till a policy is approved,” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-chief-to-map-food-truck-policy-as-distribution-halted/articleshow/87031288.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Private cars were parked there and the malaria unit was found to be in bad shape. The stairs were also full of bird droppings. The toilets were also in bad shape. Garg hauled up the sweeper for not doing his duty properly. He directed the DHS to get a list of urgent repair and maintenance works made by all in-charges of HWCs and get these verified by senior officers. He said that the sweeper’s plea that there was some function during the night which led to littering could not be accepted because it was clear that the area had not been cleaned for days. The sweeper accepted his mistake and assured that everything would be cleaned by the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/alls-not-well-with-wellness-center-ut-health-secy-finds/articleshow/87029397.cms||---

Officials at both the regional transport offices (RTOs) confirmed that car registrations, which were expected to break records this time, dropped 15% in Pune and 32% in Pimpri Chinchwad. “We had hoped that the festive season will see bumper registrations of cars at least. The figures, however, are not what we had expected. At the Pune RTO office, the car registration this Dasara period dropped to almost 15% as compared to same period last year. Similarly, in the Pimpri Chinchwad area, the car registrations dropped by almost 32%. The automobile industry is facing problems lately due to the global shortage of semiconductor chips, which resulted in the declining trend,” an RTO official said. In the two-wheeler segment too, while the Pune RTO witnessed a nominal increase of 5% in the registrations this Dasara period, the registrations in the PCMC limits declined by 31%. Shailesh Bhandari, Pune’s regional director of the Federation of Automobile Associations (FADA) and the director of BU Bhandari Auto, said he had hoped for the two-wheeler registrations to increase. “One of the main reasons behind low registration of two-wheeler is that the educational institutions were not opening. The permission to resume physical classes will have its impact. We are looking towards improved registrations in the coming months,” he said. Bhandari, however, didn’t show the same optimism for cars. “The chip shortage is a global issue, which will take time to resolve,” he added. A car dealer in Pune said he didn’t have much hopes for Diwali too. “We don’t think the car registrations will improve till the chip issue is resolved,” he said. The global shortage of semiconductor chips has clearly affected car dealers in the city during, with delivery delays pushing up booking cancellations by 30% last month. The impact of chip shortage were felt on registrations at the regional transport offices (RTOs). While 5,035 cars were registered at the Pune RTO in August, it dropped to 3,948 in September — a 22% decline. At the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO, August had 3,093 registrations, while September saw 2,411 registrations — also a 22% drop. The decline in car registration during the Dasar period comes as a huge setback for the automobile sector, considering their sales till September the year had beaten two-year record in Pune. Experts said the pent-up demand was the main driver for the increase in sales. Severe shortage of semiconductors and a swift rebound of demand in the global economy have resulted in long waiting periods across many consumer product categories such as cars, SUVs, appliances and electronics. The wait has been building on a variety of products, starting from hatchbacks to entry-level SUVs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drastic-drop-in-registration-of-cars-this-festive-period/articleshow/87029422.cms||Joy Sengupta

The pilgrimage place is one of the ‘Shaktipiths’ of the Goddess and is highly revered. The temple had remained closed since the first Covid wave last year. The temple is visited by many during the Chaitra Navratri and Sharad Navratri. Since last year, the temple has remained closed on two Chaitra Navratris and one Sharad Navratri. During the Sharad Navratri that ended on Thursday, the temple was open. While several attempts were made to ensure Covid appropriate behaviour, it was not possible due to the massive turnout. Most of the devotees did not wear a mask despite appeals in this regard. With the presence of a large crowd, social distancing was also not observed. Halol sub-divisional magistrate A K Gautam said that the crowd was regulated to some extent by ensuring that those at the foothill were taken to the mountain only in ST buses. Buses left for the mountain only after a stipulated number had returned from the temple. Most devotees preferred to go on foot, he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/massive-crowd-at-pavagadh-covid-norms-go-for-a-toss/articleshow/87028008.cms||---

Navataram Party nominee, Dr Goda Ramesh Kumar, was given the symbol, who has already started his campaign in the constituency. Jana Sena had failed to secure the required percentage of votes and win the number of seats in the 2019 general elections to the assembly to retain the symbol. Though the common symbol was given to Jana Sena candidates in the 2019 general elections, the party lost the symbol due to its failure to fulfil the requirements. The party also did not contest the Tirupati Lok Sabha elections. It is not contesting in Badvel, resulting in the party losing its symbol. BJP state unit chief had written to the Election Commission to freeze the Jana Sena symbol and remove it from the free symbols list. But the Election Commission went by the rule book and allocated the symbol to Navataram Party, which would have an adverse impact on the votes to be polled for BJP in the by-election. BJP is expecting some Jana Sena activists to vote for it as Jana Sena is not in the fray. When asked whether they have any fear of losing the symbol now, Navataram Party candidate, Dr Ramesh Kumar, said: “We have no fear of losing the symbol as it was offered to us from the free symbols list. Once the symbol is allotted, the EC will not take it back. Moreover, we have already started our election campaign and have printed some election material to distribute among the voters.” Meanwhile, the ruling YSR Congress has started its campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/navataram-party-grabs-glass-from-jana-sena/articleshow/87029420.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Tomato hits Rs 80 a kg & onion strikes half century, skewing home budgets||MUMBAI/NASHIK: The retail price of onion hit Rs Rs 50 per kg citywide this week. Another kitchen staple, the humble tomato, has come to be priced at Rs 70-80 per kg. Traders blame excess rainfall and Cyclone Gulab for crop shortage. They say rates will drop marginally only around November 15 and normalise in December. Within just 40 days, from a wholesale rate of Rs 2.50 a kg in the first week of September, tomato now costs Rs 25 a kg at Pimpalgaon, Nashik—India's largest tomato wholesale market. Heavy rainfall in September and the cyclone reportedly left hectares of fields damaged in Nashik and Kolhapur. Goregaon resident Asavari Joshi said, “Amid the fasting season of Navratra when consumption is low, I find it surprising that prices have risen so high.” Tomato wholesaler Mangal Gupta said, “Prices are commonly higher by 20% in September-October, but this month due to heavy unseasonal rains there is severe loss of crop so rates are high. They will reduce within 15 to 20 days as harvesting of the new crop which was planted in September will start.” Gupta added, “Due to excessive rain, a disease called early blight and late blight has destroyed the tomato crop in Solapur, Nashik, Satara and Pune districts.’ APMC director Ashok Walunj of the onion-potato market said, “Heavy rain and flooding in Maharashtra has caused onion to wilt. The wholesale price is Rs 35-38 per kg and retail is at Rs 50. We expect a slight fall after Diwali and total normality in December.” Walunj termed this “an act of nature that nobody can control”. Another APMC director Shankar Pingale of the vegetable market pointed to crop failure of tomato owing to excessive rain. “There is a vast shortage of tomato nationwide. At present, the wholesale rate in Vashi ranges from Rs 30-45 per kg, depending on grade. Rates will reduce only after November 15 once the new crop is harvested.” APMC trader Balasaheb Badade said onion prices will remain high through the festive season. “Rates will drop only after Diwali. Harvesting of fresh crops has been delayed, besides substantial damage to the buffer stock that has a shorter shelf life,” he said. Just recently in September, farmers in Nashik and Aurangabad had dumped tomatoes on the road in protest after wholesale rates plummeted to Rs 2-3 per kg. They are ruing their stance. Somnath Kulagi, farmer from Jat tehsil of Sangli district, had dumped the tomatoes outside the mandi as wholesale prices dropped to Rs 1.5 per kg. Now, he is being called by traders to check if he has any produce in the farm. Somnath had destroyed all tomato crop and taken up chilli cultivation. “It was for the first time that I suffered heavy losses. Now, when I see the tomatoes are fetching such a good price, I feel my decision to destroy the crop was wrong. I would have made up for the loss I faced then,” he told TOI.

---||Pune||NCP, Cong & Sena leaders in talks for civic elections||Pune: Local NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena leaders have started preliminary talks on the possibility of contesting the upcoming civic elections together. The leaders said that the discussions were to judge the sentiments of the workers of their respective parties and discuss city-related issues that could be part of the poll agenda. A final decision on uniting for the elections will be taken by the top brass of the respective parties, said the political leaders. BJP has a clear majority in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) with over 100 corporators. PMC sources, however, said that the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in 2019 is likely to change equations in the civic elections. A possibility of the NCP-Congress-Sena contesting the elections together cannot be ruled out, they said. A senior Congress leader alleged that “everyone” wants to keep BJP out of power as citizens are fed up of their “fake promises”. “We are in talks with NCP and Sena. So far, the progress has been positive,” he added. NCP has started all-out efforts to retain power in the PMC. Senior leaders from the party said that an “aggressive” plan was being chalked out for the elections. “Despite a thumping majority, the BJP has failed on many fronts in the PMC and not done anything concrete for in the last four-and-a-half years. We will raise questions on various platforms and seek answers from the BJP on their failure to fulfill the promises made to citizens five years ago,” said city NCP president Prashant Jagtap. Another leader from the NCP said that during a recent visit to Pune, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said that a decision on the poll strategy could be taken based on local situations. “We will be ready to fight the elections with the Congress and Shiv Sena. Before reaching a conclusion, we are discussing the strategy with our party workers and also MVA members,” said the NCP leader. NCP MLA Sunil Tingre said that the BJP lost two assembly seats to the NCP in the 2019 state elections and faced a tough fight on all other seats. “People want change. We are expecting a better outcome in the civic polls,” he added. The municipal elections are likely to be held in February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncp-cong-sena-leaders-in-talks-for-civic-elections/articleshow/87029457.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Festive spirit beats covid gloom||Unlike last year when festivities even though spirited were clad in the pandemic gloom, Navratri and Durga Puja celebration was an upbeat, vibrant affair, despite restraint and restrictions. The festive fever ended on a much high note, despite the ongoing pandemic as the nine nights of revelry concluded. Businesses are upbeat about Dussehra too! SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL: Even though celebrations were closed affairs limited to societies and private gatherings, Navratri and garba revelry was a whole lot of fun for most enthusiasts. "It was an unexpectedly beautiful Navratri this time. I usually prepare for the festival at least a couple of months in advance and ensure I have the passes for various commercial events. This time, even though celebrations were limited to the society and a small group of friends, it was great fun. The enthusiasm was high considering I got to enjoy Navratri and garba after a gap of two years," said Bhargav K, a resident of Gota. Vibrant Navratri: Men of Sadu Mata ni Pol in Shahpur area dress as women on the eighth day of Navratri and do garba. This 200-year-old custom is undertaken to seek forgiveness for a curse on the pol. The unique tradition is also followed by men who have prayed to Sadu Mata and on fruition of their wishes, they dress as women and participate in the garba. Durga Puja cheer in full swingDurga pandals across Ahmedabad saw devotees thronging venues to offer prayers and enjoy festivities and get to meet and greet with friends and family. "Come Durga Puja every year we go pandal hopping to see the decorations and offer our prayers. Meeting loved ones and friends and savouring traditional Bengali delicacies is another joy and completes the celebrations for us. Enjoying these moments after two years was sheer joy," said Mahua Bose, a Makarba resident. Cultural associations set up pandals in different parts of Ahmedabad including one at the ONGC Community Hall and the Kalibari temple. "We kept celebrations simple this time and issued guidelines that only those who are fully vaccinated may visit. We’ve also given prasad as takeaway," said Goutam Lahiri, general secretary, Chandkheda Bengal Cultural Association (BCA). Traders expect good businessBe it jewellers, automobile dealers or farsan shop-owners, traders are expecting good business this Dussehra. Farsan shops are estimating at least 40 tonnes of fafda sale and 30 tonnes of jalebi sale on Dussehra day. Minesh Modi, director of a Nehrunagar-based sweets and farsan store, said, "Business is back to normal this year and we’re expecting to meet pre-Covid levels. We are anticipating an estimate sale of 200kg fafda and 150kg jalebi in a single day. While home delivery through our website and other food delivery aggregators will be available, we’ve ensured measures to give fresh takeaways from the stores as well." Unlike last year, business sentiment looks much better this time. "People were apprehensive over eating out last year and due to high number of cases, the sentiment was muted. However, this year, we’re looking to do better business," said a Navrangpura-based trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/festive-spirit-beats-covid-gloom/articleshow/87029456.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Agitators led by BJP MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar seal Maharashtra mine||CHANDRAPUR: Agitators led by BJP MLA and former Maharashtra finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar closed down the Baranj opencast coal mine, owned by the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd (KPCL), in the state on Thursday to press various demands of project-affected people (PAP). Agitators dug a trench on the road leading to the mine, blocking the movement of vehicles into the quarry. There were repeated altercations between police personnel and agitators as police officials twice tried to stall the digging of the trench. BJP leaders issued an open warning to the police, saying that they would be responsible for any untoward consequences if they tried to obstruct digging of the road or dissuaded the agitators. Mungantiwar said that KPCL, despite repeated requests, has not fulfilled the long-pending demands of PAPs. The company, he said, has not carried out rehabilitation of Chek Baranj and Baranj Mokasa villages, denied minimum wages to the workers, not paid their salaries since 10 months, and has not given them back 50% of their land or its compensation at Rs 4 lakh per acre as it had committed in the agreement with the state government. “People have reached the peak of tolerance. Hence, we have closed down the mine. The roadblock on the path leading to the mine will continue till October 28. We will put a pandal on the road and 100 villagers will camp there with senior BJP leaders for next 15 days,” Mungantiwar said. Failure on part of the company to agree with the demands of PAPs will lead to further intensification of agitation, he said, warning of targeting the coal siding of KPCL and stall the company’s coal dispatch in the next stage of the agitation. A spokesperson for Kolkata-based EMTA, which is the mine developer and operator (MDO), rubbished the allegations, saying that the agitation was being driven by politics rather than merit. “The agreement between KPCL and the Maharashtra government was signed in 2017. We were awarded the MDO contract later. We are following all the R&R conditions in the agreement. Some measures take time. All these have been discussed with the MLA and officials of the state government and KPCL several times. Let the Union coal minister call a meeting and we will prove the allegations wrong,” the spokesperson told TOI.

But with inflows at Prakasam Barrage touching the 1.25 lakh cusecs mark, authorities have decided to conduct the ‘teppotsavam’ in an anchored boat at Durga ghat. “Irrigation authorities have issued an alert not to conduct the boat ride considering the flood levels and safety of devotees. We have therefore decided to conduct the teppotsavam following Agama shastra in an anchored boat. No devotees will be permitted at Durga ghat. They can watch the festivities from Prakasam Barrage,” district collector J Nivas said. City police commissioner B Srinivasulu said traffic will be diverted on Prakasam Barrage to facilitate devotees to watch teppotsavam. The festive idols will be taken to One Town police station after the event, he said. Meanwhile, around three lakh devotees from six states are coming for Deeksha Viramana at the temple this year. This, despite requests by temple authorities to devotees to skip Bhavani deeksha for this year in view of the likely third wave of Covid-19. Around 25 lakh devotees took the deeksha, out of which around six lakh are coming to Kanaka Durga temple for relinquishment. “It is not advisable to permit relinquishment at river ghats this year. Bhavani devotees should complete darshan and return to their hometowns and relinquish deeksha there,” temple EO D Bramaramba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-relinquishment-of-deeksha-at-river-ghat/articleshow/87029502.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Mumbai||57% Indians expect to fly out on business later this year, says survey||MUMBAI: After leisure travel, business travel is expected to pick up in the coming months, a global survey by a travel technology provider said. A total of 570 out of 1,000 Indian respondents, that is 57% travellers, said they expect to fly out on a business trip later this year. Globally, the number was 50%. “Asia is the top destination for Indian business and leisure travellers (44% and 45%) with almost a third (29%) expecting to take two trips in the next year,’’ the survey said, adding that 72% of Indian travellers said they are eager to travel next year. Indian travellers (95%) were also willing to provide personal information and health data for effective use of digital health passports. “Indian travellers are most comfortable providing digital health data for international travel (72%) compared to domestic travel (49%),’’ it added. Over half (53%) of Indian business travellers were willing to share their digital health data to visit an office or business event/ conference. To track traveller sentiment, the survey, commissioned by Amadeus in early September, gathered responses from over 9,000 people who travelled abroad in the last 18 months. These included travellers from France, Germany, Russia, Singapore, Spain, UAE, UK, US and 1,000 respondents in India. The biggest concern for Indian travellers was the risk of catching Covid-19 while travelling from lack of social distancing, mask wearing, etc (54%), followed by self-isolation/quarantine before and after travel (42%) and concerns about increased queues while travelling due to additional document checks (33%). Different types of travellers were concerned about different things — people who travel for business were less likely to be concerned about catching Covid-19 while travelling (51% vs 57% for leisure travellers) but more concerned about the cost of testing before and after travel (27% vs 24% for leisure travellers), said the ‘Rebuild Travel’ survey. As for technologies, mobile applications that provide on-trip notifications and alerts (55%), self-service check-in (49%) and different methods of payment, such as, pay when you fly and vouchers (47%) were most popular ones Indian respondents noted would increase their confidence to travel in the next 12 months. With respect to sustainable travel, greater transparency around travel companies’ sustainability policies was a bigger priority for older travellers (66% Gen X, Boomers), compared to younger travellers (50% Gen Z, Millennials).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/57-indians-expect-to-fly-out-on-biz-later-this-yr-in-mumbai-survey/articleshow/87031339.cms||---
---||Goa||Forensic probe may be must for major offences||Margao: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that the government intends to make forensic investigation mandatory for all criminal offences which are liable for six years of imprisonment. Addressing a gathering after performing the bhoomi-puja of the National Forensic Science University at Dharbandora, Shah said lack of trained experts in forensic science was leading to a rise in pendency of criminal cases in courts. To ensure forensic investigation is made mandatory for such crimes, Shah said it was necessary to set up forensic laboratories in over 600 districts and to provide a mobile forensic van at the level of every police subdivision. As this required availability of at least 30,000 to 40,000 forensic scientists, Shah said the National Forensic Science University was established to provide education in various disciplines of forensic science to students that would provide them assured placement. Shah urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to popularise forensic science among school students. “Just as a large number of sailors come from Goa, let Goa also produce large number of forensic scientists over the next 10 years,” Shah said. He said apart from providing forensic education to students, the forensic university will also conduct diploma courses for police officers, judicial officers, people related to cyber security and security personnel of private companies. He also asked the university authorities to formulate courses related to tourist safety, coastal policing, drugs and narcotics control, among others in the interest of Goa’s tourism sector. He said it would also effectively control the law and order situation. Shah said the forensic university was first conceived by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. The first forensic science university was established in Gujarat as a state university when Modi was the state’s chief minister, he said. “Modi worked to begin the first forensic field university in the whole world and when he became the Prime Minister, he established the National Forensic Science University,” he said. Later, Shah also inaugurated a transit camp of the university at Curti in Ponda, where 200 students have been enrolled in five disciplines of forensic science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forensic-probe-may-be-must-for-major-offences/articleshow/87031307.cms||---

The Aishbagh Ramleela will be portraying the problem of religious conversions and inequalities in their 80-feet effigy. Fully vaccinated people, following Covid protocols and social distancing will be allowed to watch the effigy burning. The vaccination status will be checked on the Arogya Setu App and a team will be deployed to check the temperature of people before allowing entry. The event will be live-streamed. “This will give a message of nationalism,” said Ramleela organiser Aditya Dwivedi. The Ravan Dahan at Daliganj will see a 15-foot effigy. “The pandemic has not ended yet, so keeping all the protocols in mind, we have made a symbolic effigy that will be burnt by children dressed as Ram, Laxman and Sita,” said Piyush Nigam, organiser of Daliganj Ravan Dahan. Some families are making effigies themselves for Ravan Dahan. “I live in a joint family so we have five children at home. My parents use Dussehra to inculcate the right cultural values in our kids. I have been making Ravana effigy for 12 years. This year, the kids decorated the effigy using their imaginative skills. The kids will dress up like Ram, Laxman and Sita and we will burn Ravana effigy after narrating the story of Ramayana in brief, and stressing that good always triumphs over evil,” said Gaurav Seth, a banker. Arti Sinha of Gomti Nagar said, “My twins make colourful Ravana effigy every year by using chart papers and gift papers. They were so excited this year that they began making the heads of Ravana a week ago. Now, they are eagerly waiting to burn it.” Arif Ansari, an effigy-maker, was a bit subdued as he said, “The demand is better than last year, but it is still low. We made 150 effigies but could sell only 60. The pandemic has hit our earnings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ravan-dahan-to-depict-triumph-over-covid/articleshow/87031329.cms||---

The 30-year-old mother of three children was murdered in cold blood in the presence of her husband by five persons, including two of her brothers-in-law. The couple were married for 10 years and had three minor children and were earning their livelihood working as agricultural labourers. According to Dwarka police, based on a complaint of murder lodged by Valabhai Solanki (32), husband of victim Rameela, on Wednesday, cops arrested Ramesh Solanki, Arjun Solanki, Versi Solanki, Anu Solanki and Bhavesh Solanki on Thursday. According to the plaint, the couple had gone to visit a temple of Meldi deity near Arambhada village at around 6am on Wednesday morning to offer prayers on the occasion of Navratri. When they reached the temple, Rameela started having psychogenic seizures and her head and body started to shake violently. Seeing this, a ‘bhuva’ or a local black magician immediately termed Rameela as a ‘witch’ directing people standing at the spot to kill her. Before anything could be reasoned, people started acting on the black magician’s advice and resorted to thrashing the woman mercilessly with iron chains boiled in hot water continuously for almost two hours until she lay dead on the spot. The horrific murder in broad daylight in the name of black magic sent shock-waves across the country. National Commission for Woman took suo moto cognizance of the incident and issued notices to district police to file a report on the nasty incident. “We have arrested all five accused involved in the murder and are probing the case,” P B Gadhvi, police inspector, Dwarka police station, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/branded-as-a-witch-young-woman-killed-in-cold-blood/articleshow/87027676.cms||---
---||Goa||BJP will make Goa model state, don’t fall for freebies, says Amit Shah||MARGAO/PANAJI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday made a strong pitch for another term in office for BJP to make Goa a model state and said those who have never understood Goa are now coming here with freebies. Shah said there was a need for long-term consistency and a clean and stable governance for the state to experience the desired results. “Consistency is essential in development,” he said. Union home minister Amit Shah addressed a BJP karyakarta sammelan at Taleigao on Thursday“If you have five years of yatra of development, five years of good and transparent government, but followed by five years of corrupt government, the state cannot achieve progress. Only when a state follows a path of development with transparency in governance over 15,20, 25 years, it can have the desired outcome. BJP has given Goa 10 years of consistent development with transparency,” Shah said. Indirectly taking a dig at AAP for its promise of free electricity to every household if it forms the government and the new entrant Trinamool Congress promising a new dawn, Shah said: “Those who do not understand and have never seen Goa come here and speak.” He said Goans want a government that teaches people to live in respect and participate in their development. “Will they get votes by announcing freebies? We want a government which not only takes the right amount of taxes from people, but also carries out developmental work in the state and does not indulge in corruption. We don’t want a government which gives freebies,” he said. “With Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre, and the way (Pramod Sawant) is working here, I am sure that the double-engine government will help Goa become a model state,” Shah said. Exhorting the karyakartas to work towards getting BJP an absolute majority in the assembly elections scheduled for early next year, he said though Goa had a double-engine government, it was short by a few coaches. “This time we don’t want less coaches, but we want full majority. Absolute majority gives stability and corruption-free administration and makes a vast difference. If Modi had not got absolute majority, then would it have been possible to construct Ram temple and abrogate Article 370?” Shah said. He said Modi will achieve the dream of making India a 5-trillion-dollar economy before 2024. “When former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee left office, India’s economy was at the 11th place. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, even after being in office for 10 years, could not change this position. It was stuck there itself. After Modi took over the reins of the country, India’s economy ranked between fifth and sixth position and by 2024, we will be the third or fourth largest economy in the world,” he said. Shah said Goa is a ‘bindi’ on India’s forehead and it is the responsibility of BJP to make that bindi beautiful, develop it and protect and preserve its environment. “This is the reason we have to win for the third time in Goa,” he said. Referring to the victory of BJP in zilla panchayat and municipal elections as passing of small tests, he urged the party workers to also win the final exams that will come in the form of assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-will-make-goa-model-state-dont-fall-for-freebies-says-shah/articleshow/87031334.cms||---
---||Goa||HC dismisses plea challenging ban on entry of Goans in casinos||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed a petition filed by a law student who challenged the legal provisions that make it an offence for non-tourists to partake in gambling activities in casinos in Goa. The petitioner, Shukr Usgaonkar, told the court that he wants to visit casinos, which have now started functioning after a long pause due to Covid, but is barred from doing so on account of Section 13G of the Goa Gambling Act, 1976, which forbids the entry of any person other than a tourist or holder of a tourist permit. He stated that the provisions contravene Article 13(2) of the Constitution, which prohibits the state from making any law violative of fundamental rights. He contended that the state did this when, via the Goa Public Gambling (Amendment) Act, 2012, it prohibited access to places where games authorised under Section 13A are conducted. “The distinction being made between tourists and non-tourists miserably fails the test of reasonable classification which must be fulfilled by any classification to withstand the rigours of Article 14 as laid down by the Supreme Court,” the petitioner stated in his petition. “The intelligible differentia between tourists and non-tourists has no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved, inasmuch as the mending Act contains not so much as a whisper of the object sought to be achieved by making the said classification,” he added. He filed the writ petition seeking that Sections 2(7), 2(8), 13D(e), 13G(1), and 13G(2) of the Gambling Act and the corresponding provisions of the 2012 amendment be held ultra vires under the Constitution of India. According to the Act, a ‘tourist’ is a person or group of persons above 21 but not domiciled or permanently residing in Goa. The term includes pilgrims and those holding a valid tourist permit issued under the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-ban-on-entry-of-goans-in-casinos/articleshow/87031341.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Festive rush, drop in night temp spike air pollution before Diwali’||Lucknow: Festive rush together with a slight drop in the night temperatures have impacted the city’s clean air causing a spike in air pollution levels by over 100 units in the past one week. The state capital was under the ‘satisfactory’ air quality category in the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) list at the beginning of the month. However, it now figures in the ‘moderate’ air quality category. The exposure to such air leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases, warn experts. The analysis of Lucknow’s Air Quality Index (AQI) data released daily by CPCB indicates an increasing trend in the city’s air pollution level. While the city’s AQI was 71 on October 1, on Thursday an AQI of 156 was recorded. From October 1-7, the city's air pollution levels ranged between 71 and 156 with October 3 recording an AQI of 55 (lowest pollution levels witnessed in October). Thereafter, the air pollution increased falling in a range of 130-175, with October 10 recording a highest of 175. According to Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre of Science and Environment, New Delhi, the change in weather conditions and local factors has led to this spike. “Every year around this time from October onwards winter pollution begins to build up. One of the key reasons behind it is the atmospheric changes. As winter sets in, we experience something called ‘temperature inversion condition’ in which due to falling temperatures, air cannot rise high to disperse and as a result it gets trapped and so do the pollutants,” she said. Environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta attributed traffic jams due to the festive rush to the hike in pollution level. He said, “Traffic snarls because of people venturing out for festivals are the main reason behind the spike in air pollution levels. People should use the metro and public transport more to save air quality from deteriorating.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/festive-rush-drop-in-night-temp-spike-air-pollution-before-diwali/articleshow/87031348.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Handover of projects to Krishna River Management Board unlikely as Telangana awaits report||HYDERABAD: Implementation of the Centre’s gazette notification on handing over of outlets of Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects by the twin Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana isn’t happening anytime soon, primarily because the latter is yet to decide on key issues, top officials said. The Telangana government is hesitant to give away the power stations on these projects and is yet to decide on the Peddavagu project, with officials saying it will take some more time before any clarity is achieved. According to sources, the Telangana government is also awaiting a report on these projects from a committee formed on six outlets (canals and regulators) before handing them over to the Krishna River Board Management (KRMB). The government instructed the committee headed by engineering in chief Muralidhar to take into consideration the argument put forth by Telanagan before the Brajesh Kumar Tribunal and also keep the interests of the state while making recomendations. The KRMB has already ordered the state governments of AP and Telangana to hand over all outlets on the Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects by October 14. The board requested that state governments issue separate GOs in order to finish the process of handing over the projects listed in the Union Jal Shakti Ministry’s gazette. Andhra Pradesh has issued GO 54, transferring to KRMB, the Srisailam Spillway, Pothyredypadu head regulator, Srisailam Right canal, Handrineeva Lift Irrigation project, and Mucchumarri lift irrigation schemes. But with a condition that Telnagan also has to hand over the projects. Telangana has not issued any GO and is unwilling to hand over three hydel projects (Srisailam Left Bank, Nagarjuna Sagar main power house, and Nagarjuna Sagar left powerhouse). According to sources, the Gazette implementation will take place only if both states issue GOs, which appears unlikely at this time. “By the end of the month, there may be clarity on regular outlets,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/handover-of-projects-to-krmb-unlikely-as-t-awaits-report/articleshow/87029632.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: St Francis Xavier feast to be open to public, with SOPs||PANAJI: For the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic, the Basilica of Bom Jesus will welcome pilgrims for the novenas and feast of St Francis Xavier on December 3, but by following all SOPs. The government has given its go-ahead for the novenas and feast Masses to be held outside the Basilica, where a large pandal will be set up similar to pre-pandemic times. However, this time, the numbers will be limited. All services will simultaneously be broadcast online for the faithful who cannot be physically present for the feast of the saint revered as ‘Goencho Saib’. “Everything is opening up. The government has permitted us to have services outside the Basilica this year provided we maintain all SOPs, sanitising and social distancing. Live streaming of services will also continue,” rector of the Basilica, Fr Patricio Fernandes, told TOI. Meetings have already been held with various government authorities including the North Goa collector, and representatives have inspected the venue to check on requirements that will have to be put in place. The Basilica committee and the Archbishop of Goa have also met over the issue. Fernandes said that modalities are being worked out and that announcements will soon be made to the faithful regarding SOPs that will be followed during the ten days. Last year, when it was not possible to congregate due to MHA restrictions due to Covid-19, novena Masses were not open to the public at the Basilica but were streamed live on the official website and Youtube channel of the Basilica, as well as on CCRTV. Besides seeing a regular flow of tourists, the world heritage monument which houses the relics of St Francis Xavier draws lakhs of devotees each year during the novenas and feast Masses. It also sees several devotees from neighbouring states and Goa undertaking walking pilgrimages to Old Goa during this time. Earlier this year, a multi-disciplinary team from the ASI completed the restoration work of the iconic four century-old silver Mastrillian casket weighing 400 kg, containing the relics of St Francis Xavier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sfx-feast-to-be-open-to-public-with-sops/articleshow/87031353.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||Pune: Worshippers return masked and cautious as Navaratra begins||PUNE: The first day of Navaratra, which coincided with the reopening of places of worship after a long gap, saw devotees queuing up at Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Mandir . A calm and cautious atmosphere prevailed inside as people waited— five feet apart — for darshan, a contrast from the traffic chaos outside on Laxmi Road with passersby trying to catch a glimpse of the idol and click photos of the decoration. Ashok Godse, president, Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust, said the temple’s doors opened again on Thursday amid chanting and the sound of the ‘shehnai’. “Darshan was conducted in adherence to all safety precautions as per the state government. Only devotees who wore masks were allowed to inside after checking their temperature and sanitising their hands,” said Godse. Close by, at Shree Kasba Ganapati Mandal, visitors were few and far between. “Apart from Ganeshotsav, there is not much crowd at this temple, which is why I like to come here. But even then, visitors have been cautious. Before the pandemic, I used to sit in the temple for a while after darshan, now we are supposed to just pray and go,” said Nanda Taware, temple visitor. Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar in Camp was abuzz with devotees. “The turnout through the day was 25% more than regular days. Everyone followed safety protocols without us having to tell anyone to comply. We had an elaborate langar where we served kadhi-pakoda, chawal, and jalebi,” said Mohindev Singh Kandhari, PRO, at the gurdwara. Mosques welcomed devotees to offer their daily prayers on the premises. Hazrat Maulana Nizamuddin Fakhruddin, president of the Darul Uloom Nizamia Sufia, Kondhwa, said, “People enjoyed the experience of offering prayers with fellow members of the community at the masjid. We had around 100-150 people come throughout the day. The sense of peace that you feel when you pray at the mosque is different from doing namaz at home and we are glad to have that back.” At St Anne’s Catholic Church, Solapur Bazar, parish priest Father Malcom Sequeira said not too many people were expected since it was a weekday but many worshippers will come on Sunday. “Members of our church are divided into different groups — 30-40 families have a WhatsApp group with one ‘leader’, who will guide them through safety precautions and social distancing protocols on that day. We will also put a few chairs on the loft if the church is full, and when that is also occupied, we will close entry for that service,” said Sequeira Saptashrungi sees highest footfall in Nashik district The Saptashrungi temple on Thursday registered the highest footfall of devotees among all prominent temples in Nashik as the reopening of temples coincided with the first day of Navaratra. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal visited the Saptashrungi Devi Mandir in Vani, a gurdwara in Shingada Talao, and the Badi Dargah at Kazipura in Nashik city. Though the yatra — the annual fair — has been cancelled this year due to the Covid-related restrictions on gathering of crowds, the number of devotees registering themselves online and visiting the temples stood at about 6,500 till Thursday evening. 11,000 people visit Shirdi Saibaba temple Officials of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST) on Thursday said 11,000 devotees visited the temple on the first day of the reopening of Shirdi Sai temple. "The turnout of devotees for darshan was encouraging. We are optimistic that the footfall will further increase. The bulk of the devotees on Thursday were from within the state," the officials said. The SSST management has made the online booking of passes mandatory. No offline passes are being distributed to prevent overcrowding at the pass centres. A total of 15,000 devotees will be allowed per day and 1,150 per hour||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/worshippers-return-masked-cautious-as-navaratra-begins/articleshow/86850673.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

We will hand it over to NGOs so that anyone with basic knowledge will be able assist those in rural India get access to better healthcare facilities,” said Ramesh Loganathan, who heads the Raj Reddy Center for Technology and Society (RCTS), IIITH, which has been organising roundtable conferences with NGOs, doctors and academicians on healthcare problems. The centre is now working on five to six projects. He said that the centre has already developed an app, which is ready to be used in a cancer screening bus. “An NGO, Grace Cancer Foundation, has five cancer screening buses, but the problem is with manpower as it is hard to find doctors willing to go to remote areas. Now, we have created an app through which doctors will be available remotely and can refer patients to nearby hospitals,” he added. The centre has also developed an app for a medical drive for another NGO CARE India. “We are working on two apps for CARE India — one to detect congenital heart diseases and other to create AI models for anaemia screening via an app which will allow a basic smartphone to do entire screening. For Grace Cancer Foundation, we are developing an oral cancer algorithm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiith-tech-balm-for-ruralhealthcare-lying-in-sickbed/articleshow/87029656.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Ryan Jackson, executive officer, CVN-70, said the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is currently home for nearly 5,000 personnel of the US Navy, besides housing nearly 60 to 70 aircraft. Describing it as a ‘floating city’, Ryan said the supercarrier has everything to sustain for years in the sea without any external support. The body of Osama Bin Laden was buried at sea in 2011 from the deck of Carl Vinson. The ship is named after Carl Vinson, a Congressman from Georgia, in recognition of his contributions to the US Navy. The ship was launched in 1980, undertook her maiden voyage in 1983, and underwent refuelling and overhaul between 2005 and 2009. Besides deployments in Operation Desert Strike, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Enduring Freedom, Carl Vinson was involved in a number of notable events. On Veterans Day in 2011, she played host to the first NCAA basketball game on an aircraft carrier, between North Carolina and Michigan State.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/floating-city-carl-vinson-the-show-stealer-of-malabar-drill/articleshow/87029646.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Goa||Goa dealers can’t meet buyers’ demand for cars||PANAJI: Automobile dealers in Goa are facing the ripple effect of the ongoing semiconductor (chip) shortage. Vehicle manufacturers are struggling with production issues forcing them to curtail supplies to dealers, as a result of which dispatches to buyers in Goa have missed the auspicious Dussehra delivery. “With the 42-day-long peak season having commenced with the first navratra, dealers are finding it difficult to convince customers to wait indefinitely for the vehicles of their choice,” president of the Goa automobile dealers’ association, Prashant Joshi said. He also said that there has been “robust demand” for several vehicle models this year, however, dealers are witnessing a sharp decline in spot buying due to low stock of vehicles”. Joshi said that in some cases, buyers are even cancelling their bookings for not being able to dispatch the vehicle by the festival date. “As per our data, while 50-60% buyers go for prior booking, the rest 40% are those who just come to the dealership and just buy a vehicle of their choice from ready stock. Presently this chapter is closed for us as most of the dealers have very limited stock in hand,” Joshi said. While the poor availability of their four-wheeler of choice has dampened the customers’ festival spirit, the situation is poles apart in the two-wheeler vehicle category. The desire to purchase a two-wheeler on this auspicious occasion according to GADA is “better but the demand is unsurprising.” Lockdown 2020 prompted a global spending spree on electronic items as people rushed to set up home offices thus squeezing supplies of everything from cars to computer monitors and headphones. US-China tensions are also part of the story. Last August, the US banned foreign companies whose chips use American technology from selling to a Chinese tech giant over espionage allegations. The car industry has been the most visible victim so far, with many brands forced to slow their output in recent months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-dealers-cant-meet-buyers-demand-for-cars/articleshow/87031383.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Nagpur||Exempting rly and roads from EIA will have adverse impact: Experts||Nagpur: More reactions are pouring in against the Centre against the move to dilute the Forest (Conservation) Act (FCA), 1980, which was brought in to stop dereservation of forests in the country. In its submissions to the MoEFCC, Legal Initiative for Forest & Environment (LIFE) has said the ministry has made it clear from where the pressure and demands are coming from to change the law. “The overall thrust of the proposed amendment is to facilitate the diversion of the forest. Exemption for roads and railways involving forest land acquires prior to 1980 will be detrimental to conservation,” said Ritwick Dutta, environment lawyer and managing trustee of LIFE. “The emphasis of the proposed amendment, besides facilitating diversion is to promote the growth of trees in private land. There is no doubt that tree plantation outside forest areas needs to be encouraged, but these cannot be regarded as forest and should not be adjusted against India’s national determined contributions (NDC) to fight climate change,” Dutta said. Dutta added, “Railway lines and roads are exempt from the requirement of EIA. Exempting them from forest clearance will have a serious adverse impact. Besides, there is no purpose in allowing zoos and safari parks in forest areas. These are non-site specific projects and can be very well be established in non-forest land.” Citing examples how exemption to railways, Dutta said, “The main railway line from Delhi to Chennai passes through as many as seven corridors. However, only one section of the line has come under scrutiny for safeguards/mitigation measures (Ratapani Sanctuary, MP) while the status of others remains unknown.” The Chandrapur-Gondia-Balaghat railway line passes through the Tadoba-Navegaon and the Kanha-Pench corridor. While limited mitigation measures have been put in the stretch through Balaghat, no mitigation steps have been taken by the Chandrapur Circle. Besides, expansion of the Nagpur-Chhindwara line passing through the Pench-Satpura corridor has been done without any mitigation measures. Since 1987, the country has lost 150 elephants in railway accidents. As per WII, on average, 25 elephants die because of running over by train every year. He said the exemption of projects for strategic and defense needs can be reviewed. The process can be streamlined but the blanket exemption will have serious ecological consequences. Allowing a one-time exemption for a private residence in the private forest will lead to fragmentation of forest areas besides deforestation. This will open areas such as the Aravalli’s mountains to private real estate development. Similarly, the amendments propose exclusion of road projects from the purview of obtaining FC for land acquired before October 25, 1980. It must be pointed out that the situation with respect to both forest and wildlife has changed since 1980. “First, there has been a loss of forest and fragmentation of forest. Wildlife areas have lost connectivity. Combined with that, vehicle number, as well as speed, has increased. Therefore, expanding roads even of the land that belongs to the highway authority will lead to severe impact on wildlife. This is compounded by the fact that most highway expansion does not require EIA clearance since they are less than 100 km by splitting up the projects,” said Dutta. Bengaluru-based BMT Rajeev, ex-IFS and author, has submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the proposed amendments will cut the arms of FCA in protecting the existing wood lots, wastelands, and trees along the highways, railways, military establishments, and government institutions and also in urban areas for development of infrastructures. “It will open the Pandora box for grant of forest lands make the states’ land banks empty for all purposes throwing the wildlife into open lands to aggravate the man-animals conflicts. Further, it will open the gates for the timber lobby. It is against the interest of the ecology, environment, climate, wildlife, and the people since forests are only the source to protect all the life forms on the earth from disasters,” said Rajeev. “The amendments nullify powers given by the apex court to the MoEFCC. The FCA should not be diluted but some concessions should be given to the private forests,” he added. SOME SUGGESTIONS * For roads & railways no exemption should be granted for construction in the land already acquired. In case it is granted, it should be done only after mandatory assessment by WII, NBWL, and NTCA where corridors are involved. * Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) should be done or impact assessment under EIA. * The amendments will open up a large area of forest land for the purpose of non-forest activity without undergoing the process given under the provisions of FCA. * The move will put zoos and safaris out of the purview of non-forest activities. It will give freehand to the authorities to fell trees in any forest area. * Zoo and safaris are non-site-specific activities and do not need forest land. These are essentially commercial activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/exempting-rly-and-roads-from-eia-will-have-adverse-impact-experts/articleshow/87029687.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Vijayawada||Four children drown in Krishna village canal||Vijayawada: In a tragic incident, four children, including three girls, drowned while playing near a canal at Varahapatnam village of Kaikaluru mandal in Krishna district on Thursday evening. The deceased were identified as Veeragani Kaavya Sree (11), Veeragani Saavya Sree (10), Lukka Nikitha (10) and Lukka Veeranjanailu (6). According to Kaikaluru circle inspector YV Lakshmi Naidu, the incident happened around 4.30 pm when the four children accompanied by their grandmother were playing near the water body.  Cops said that initially, Veeranjanailu fell into the canal and the other three kids jumped into the water body in bid to rescue him. “The grandmother too jumped into the canal, but she could not save the children,” Naidu told TOI. Police said the canal waters were at least 10 ft deep owing to the recent rains and flood in Krishna river. While the deceased children were related to each other, Veeranjanailu and Nikitha were siblings. A case has been registered under section 174 of CrPC (death due to drowning) at Kaikaluru police station. The bodies were sent to a local government hospital for post-mortem. Further investigation is on. A pall of gloom descended on the village after the news broke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/four-children-drown-in-krishna-village-canal/articleshow/87029682.cms||---

Muskan Ansari, 17, a native of Purqazi village, 30 km from Muzaffarnagar, has been holding workshops on making reusable cotton pads at home, their proper washing and drying for reuse. Muskan wants to see girls in her village talk freely about periods. “I tell women not to use rags and dirty cloth during periods. I further convince them to make their own sanitary napkins which they can even sell to those who don’t know stitching,” she said. Pursuing humanities from Vidya Gyan, Bulandshahr, Muskan began the ‘Kapda Kranti’ last year but the journey was not an easy one. There was heavy criticism from within the family. “I had to face elders who said I have become over-educated and am bringing bad name, but my mother supported me. She in fact went door-to-door with me to convince girls to attend workshops,” Muskan said. The teen’s efforts are now yielding results. For 48-year-old Nur Jahan, mother of Aiza (names changed on request), buying a pack of sanitary napkins was out of bounds. “In our community, even talking about menstruation is a taboo. But I was happy to see my daughter making sanitary napkin at home. We both make napkins now and talk freely about periods,” Jahan said. Muskan’s English teacher at Vidya Gyan, Sangeeta Rai said, “Muskan’s endeavour is the result of community outreach programmes of our school. At one such event, Muskan came up with the idea of hygienic and sustainable ways to deal with menstrual health. She went a step ahead and started ‘Kapda Kranti’ and has impacted the lives of so many girls and young women, teaching them how to make reusable clean sanitary pads with little resources.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teen-girl-promotes-menstrual-hygiene-with-kapda-kranti/articleshow/87031408.cms||Isha Jain

These included 24,000 new vacancies in government departments, free tablets for students and Rs 200 crore relief for those in tourism sector. Elaborating further, Dhami said he had made 350 announcements, besides visiting most of the 13 districts. Other achievements that he listed included Vatsalaya Yojana, constituting a committee to review the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act, setting up of a panel to review laws related to the purchase of land by people from other states and extending one-year relaxation in age limit to government job aspirants in the wake of Covid-19. Firing a salvo at government, the Congress claimed changing three chief ministers in four months itself reflects the failure of the BJP and the announcements are being made just to hide the government's poor performance in four years. To which, Dhami said, “In this brief tenure, I have tried to reach out to remote villages of the state and ensure that benefits of our scheme reach the needy. It is not only about making 350 announcements but also how these are going to be implemented. Our teams are working on it and work is on at a rapid pace.” Dhami said announcements are related to different sectors, including education, health and employment. “If we are coming up with 24,000 new jobs, we are ensuring that we are better placed as far as battling the possible third Covid wave is concerned. Through different projects we are improving road, rail and air connectivity, which in the long run will boost the tourism sector,” said the CM. Dwelling on issues related to the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act and placing a cap on purchase of land in Uttarakhand by outsiders, Dhami said committees have been formed to look into the matter. Saying government is working for all-round development of the state, the CM said, “We have launched Vatsalaya Yojana and Mahalaxmi Yojana for the welfare of women and newborns.” Not ready to buy any of Dhami’s development claims, Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “Dhami is making the best possible effort to cover up the failure of his predecessors and in the process is making one announcement after the other. A short time is left for the implementation of Model Code of Conduct therefore, these declarations have no meaning and will fail to impress voters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/100-days-in-office-350-announcements-says-dhami-cong-terms-it-bid-to-hide-failures/articleshow/87027759.cms||Kautilya Singh

A probe by the Yavat police revealed that ‘informer’ Rahul Randive, along with his aide Prasad Anpat (29), had tied a country-made pistol to the car’s silencer before ‘alerting’ the Pune rural police chief. Both the accused were arrested on Wednesday. “The car is owned by Pune-based lawyer Bharat Mande. Randive wanted to implicate Mande in a criminal case, so that he could later pressure the lawyer for the withdrawal of a domestic violence case against a relative,” said inspector Narayan Pawar of Yavat police.  Mande said he was representing a man, who wanted a divorce from his wife. His wife’s relatives had registered a case of domestic violence with the Pune rural police. “Last month, when I had gone to the Indapur court, a man who identified himself as ‘Chavan’ approached and asked me to settle the matter. I did not expect that they would go to this extent,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-attempts-to-implicate-lawyer-with-illegal-gun/articleshow/87029719.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Nagpur||More than coal, it’s management crisis caused by power plants: Study||Nagpur: The nationwide coal crunch being faced by thermal power plants has not been built overnight. Instead, it is a gradual decline in coal stock at power plants since April 2020, reveals latest analysis of government data which highlights the situation as more of a “management crisis” than coal. As per the analysis, the failure is most likely at the end of power plants which did not stock up coal despite having ample time. The latest research on the country’s coal crisis done by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) is based on data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and Ministry of Coal (MoC). According to the research, coal-based power plants had 50.9 million tonne (MT) of coal stock in April 2020 and 20.8MT in May 2021. “They are now facing a crisis when the coal stock at power plants dropped to 8MT at the end of September 2021. This further reduced to 7.3MT (just enough for four days) at the end of the first week of October 2021,” the analysis stated.On Thursday, TOI reported that Coal India Limited (CIL) had asked all thermal power plants in the state to stock up coal.Analysts Sunil Dahiya and Shivansh Ghildiyal further found that electrical energy demands were higher in 2021 as compared to previous years. India’s highest-ever peak demand was on July 7, 2021, at 200.57 GW. “Despite the unprecedented demand for electricity in July and August 2021, contribution from coal plants remained lower, thanks to higher generation from renewable and hydro sources. This to a large extent helped in meeting the demand and giving a breather to coal power plants,” they stated.Despite lower generation from coal-based power plants and higher contributions from renewable energy, the former are facing a resource crunch.As per the analysis, CIL produced 84MT coal in March 2020 and 81MT in March 2021, ramping up production by approximately 20MT from previous months. “Given that CIL’s production has remained consistent since April 2021 and the dispatch to power sector also remained steady with healthy coal stocks remaining with CIL, it is very unlikely that the current crisis is due to a lack of coal mining or dispatch. There is very little evidence on the impacts of heavy rainfall on mining and dispatch as well,” the analysis said.Further stating that power companies probably did not want to stock up coal anticipating the dip in demand due to Covid-19 or longer monsoons than anticipated, the analysis stressed that coal-fired power plants had ample time and indication since January 2021 on how demand would pick up. “This raises a big question on the ability of power companies to understand and project demand in a reasonable manner. It is also very likely that coal plants were expecting another Covid-19 wave in September-October 2021,” it said.However, according to researchers, the crisis could have been avoided in either case if there was reasonable prediction on demand and timely uptake of stock by the power companies. “Contrary to popular narrative, this is not a coal crisis or installed coal power capacity crisis but a management crisis. New coal mines and power plants are unlikely to solve the issue, rather high quality power demand projection and strict monitoring of coal stock at power plants would avert such a crisis in the future,” the analysis concluded.What the analysis says- Coal crunch a result of gradual decline in coal stock at power plants since April 2020- India’s electrical energy demands were higher in 2021 compared to previous years- Despite major contribution from renewables, power plants still facing shortage of coal- CIL’s production remained constant since April 2021- Crisis could have been avoided with reasonable prediction on demand and timely uptake of stock by the power companies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-than-coal-its-management-crisis-caused-by-power-plants-study/articleshow/87026574.cms||Manka Behl

Work on detailing for the Bio-Safety Level III Laboratory, needed for the manufacture, has started, and the deadline for the lab’s completion is January 2022, said senior officials. Subhash Shankarwar, general manager of production at Haffkine, said, “Tender has been issued for the construction of this safety lab. Its construction could be completed by January.” The lab, which will be built under supervision of scientists of ICMR and Haffkine, will then be tested for a month. Haffkine got permission in April to manufacture Covaxin through a transfer of technology from manufacturer Bharat Biotech. In August, it put out technical bids for construction of the BSL III lab. Earlier in the week, Covaxin got the nod from the central exert committee for emergency use for the 2-17 age group. The Haffkine plant could under the circumstances play a role in boosting production of Covaxin. Haffkine officials said technology transfer is a gradual process and would happen in stages. Shankarwar said after the lab is validated, three batches of the vaccine will be produced and tested for stability for three months. If all is well, production of the vaccine could be started in April and the vaccine could hit the markets in May. Haffkine officials have said they can produce 22.8 crore doses of Covaxin annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-haffkines-rollout-of-covaxin-not-likely-till-may/articleshow/87031565.cms||---

Under Covid protocol, bhandara (community feast) or kanya bhoj was not organised in most of the pandals unlike the tradition of Durga festival but some organisers stuck to the tradition and organised bhandara or kanya bhoj but not on a large scale. According to orders of the district collector under section 144 of CrPC, taking out immersion procession of Durga idols is banned and each organiser of pandal has to inform the district administration about 10 persons going with the idol of Maa Durga for immersion at the immersion sites. They will perform rituals before the immersion at the immersion sites and hand over the idols to BMC staff, who will carry out immersion through cranes. Heavy security arrangements have been made at the immersion sites to keep the revellers under control and ensure observance of Covid restrictions. An official of the district administration said that immersion will be carried out at all the immersion sites of the city and staff from district police, revenue, BMC, SDRF and NDRF will be on duty for immersion of the idols and security of the participants. He further said that safe distance between two idols being brought to an immersion site will be maintained and immersion of idols will be carried out one after another.

---||Pune||Pune airport closure to hit cargo, but no impact on vaccine movement||PUNE: The traders’ community is worried about the prospect of incurring additional cost towards transport of goods from the city to Mumbai by road due to the 14-day Pune airport closure for runway re-carpeting from October 16. The rising cost of fuel is already not helping their cause, as the same reflects in the increased transportation cost. Sources in Kool-ex Cold Chain Limited, the vaccine transporters, have said movement of vaccines would not be affected.  However, the biggest sufferers were the flyers and many of them have cancelled their trips. “I will have to use the Mumbai airport and road transportation has become costly due to the high fuel prices. I talked to a few transport companies and they are asking for around Rs14,000 for the transportation. If we would have known about the closure earlier, we could have planned something,” the representative of a company that supplies machine parts told TOI. Representative of a flower business firm said, “I tried to talk to the private transporters and they are asking for Rs13,000 to Rs15,000 per truck with a weight of one tonne. The company that transports my product to the Pune airport is also asking for Rs12,000. Besides, the cargo handling costs in Mumbai are higher than Pune. I will have to bear the charges.” A representative of a logistics company told TOI that the high transportation costs was due to the fuel prices. “As the closure was announced only recently, many are trying to take advantage of the situation because the traders were not prepared.” Sources in Kool-Ex said they were not worried. “A bulk of vaccine transportation is happening via road and Mumbai airport due to less flight connectivity in Pune. The Indian Air Force (IAF) had earlier helped in transporting vaccines to Bangladesh and Bhutan. We don’t see any disruptions due to the closure,” an official with Kool-Ex said. Prashant Girbane, director general of the Marhatta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture, said, “Passenger traffic was a cause of bigger worry. Over the next two weeks, the impact on cargo will be lesser than that on passenger traffic, as there is no international cargo due to no international flights from Pune. For cargo, the larger discussion is not the two-week disruption but the strong Centre-state collaboration needed to set up an international cargo terminal.” Flyers and travel agents continued to suffer. Travel agents said they were witnessing around 15% cancellation of trips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airport-closure-to-hit-cargo-but-no-impact-on-vaccine-movement/articleshow/87029837.cms||Joy Sengupta

Some are even performing in these Ramlilas. The most prominent among them is urban development minister Bansidhar Bhagat, who is playing the role of Dashrath in the Ramlila at Haldwani. Besides, former Congress minister, Bittu Karnatak, in Almora is playing the character of Ravan. Ramesh Rawat, a resident of Haldwani, told TOI, “Locally, Bhagat is popular as Haldwani's Dashrath as he has been playing the character since 1979.” Similarly, Karnatak has been playing the role of Ravan for nearly a decade now. However, the Ramlila stage is being used to gather political support as well. In Yamunotri, MLA Kedar Singh Rawat used the stage to hail the Centre for delivering on the promises of Ram Mandir and abrogating Article 370 and 35A.“This is not about politics but tradition. I took out time to participate in the Ramlila even as a minister,” Karnatak told TOI. Locals also share his sentiment. “We love him as Ravan because he is an excellent actor. We don't see this from the prism of politics. His performance attracts many people towards Ramlila here,” said Hem Joshi, an Almora resident. Meanwhile, Ramlilas and Ravan Dahan events near the Indo-Nepal border have been attracting viewers from across the border as well.However, the Ramlila stage is being used to gather political support as well.

The community enjoys the bhog at pandals. This year too, despite Covid protocols, people came from far off places to collect the bhog,” he said.Dr Bag of PNBS, which was the only pujo committee which served the bhog in Thali style in parcel, said the bookings were initially taken online through Googlesheet but organizers got overwhelming response in offline booking too at the pandal. “Our bhog presentation, decided by bhog committee under Abhijeet Ghosal, received appreciation. Though we could not bring back the joy of the community lunch which is a hallmark of the pujo, the devotees got something to cheer about,” he said.The first timer organizers at Mahindrs Bloomdale Society, Mihan, offered the bhog for free. Soumyajit Kundu, a key member among the organizers, said 60 people were offered the bhog at the banquet hall where over-crowding was not allowed.Former CP PKB Chakraborty said bhog is nothing but ‘prasad’. “In Sanatan dharma, bhog has a place of high esteem,” he said.Another prominent devotee Dr AA Mukherjee, a visitor at PNBS, said the joy which one would get from savoring the hot khichdi at pandal was missing. “The khichdi tastes completely different when served hot and having it together is unforgettable experience for which Bengalis wait for a year,” he said.Saathi Roy who made bhog at home, said a simple khichdi tastes so extraordinary as bhog which cannot be explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-covid-induced-fast-sumptuous-bhog-returns-to-durga-pandals-of-city/articleshow/87026597.cms||Soumitra Bose

The draft report entails three aspects based on information, education and communication (IEC) strategies as per Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) programme, which when clubbed forms ‘SAFAAI’ — SA stands for Spreading Awareness, FAA for Facilitating Availability and Accessibility. And ‘I’ is to do with Icchashakti (will power/commitment). Under the model, IIM-I proposes to disseminate information and spread awareness on waste segregation among people. It also talks about making people know about cleanliness behaviours. It further talks about facilitating availability and accessibility of critical resources required for behavioural change. And finally, the task is to mobilise people from intention to action. Commenting on the draft report, MCA commissioner Vishal Singh said, “We got this study done to have a scientific understanding on how to create awareness on cleanliness and kind of interventions required to have maximum impact.” Singh said, the draft action plan has come up with SOMA — “S’ocial Signalling, ‘O’pportunity, ‘M’otivation and ‘A’wareness as an IEC strategy to make Ayodhya cleaner. “It begins from spreading awareness on waste segregation to keeping localities, houses clean and not vandalising garbage bins. It also looks at effective strategies to propel media to promote Swachhta. Accordingly, we will look for infrastructure and manpower enhancement and a strategy for the corporation on planning and budget allocation. We are yet to get the second report. The idea is to implement it in totality,” Singh said. The report is the outcome of an extensive research carried out by a five-member team lead by IIM-I director Prof Himanshu Rai. Employing a multi-method diagnostic approach on nearly 1,000 participants, including ward representatives, corporation workers and common masses, the team identified current practices and roadblocks related to waste segregation and various IEC strategies to promote Swachhta in Ayodhya. The findings were validated through a door-to-door survey of various wards of Ayodhya. Delighted to prepare the draft action plan to make the birthplace of Lord Ram cleaner, IIM-I director Prof Himanshu Rai said, “We have come up with the SAFAAI model for cleanliness of Ayodhya. Now, people need to show their willingness for SAFAAI, and municipal corporation need to ensure availability and accessibility of required facilities to the people.”Apart from Prof Rai, the project was spearheaded by management experts — Prof Ganesh N (economics), Prof Shruti Tewari (social psychologist), Prof Vaijayanthee (organisational behaviour) and Prof Prashant Salwan (strategy and international business).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iim-i-model-to-make-ayodhya-tourism-icon/articleshow/87031435.cms||Isha Jain

---||Goa||Shah warns India’s enemies against ‘flirting’ with borders||Margao: Recalling the surgical strikes India carried out inside Pakistan-controlled territory to retaliate against a terror attack on an Army camp in Uri, Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday sounded a stern warning to India’s enemies against “flirting” with the country’s borders and said every such act will be responded with befitting retaliatory moves by India. “Earlier, such acts of border incursions would be followed only by talks and pleas. Now every provocation will be retaliated by an equal measure,” he said. The warning came against the backdrop of efforts by Pakistan-based jehadi terror attacks to hurt India in J&K and in other parts. Shah said the surgical strikes across the Line of Control of 2016 changed the way the world looked at India. When India responded to the killings of our jawans in Uri with surgical strikes across the Line of Control, Shah said, a message was sent across the globe that flirting with India’s borders was now no longer an easy task. “The surgical strikes, for the first time ever, helped restore the honour of the nation’s borders and thus reinforced India’s sovereignty,” he said. Speaking at the bhoomi-pujan function of the National Forensic Science University at Dharbandora, Shah paid glorious tributes to former Goa chief minister and defence minister Manohar Parrikar stating that the seminal work done by him on the defence front had helped change the world’s outlook towards India. Shah said Parrikar would be remembered for a long time to come primarily for two things—one, for the implementation of one-rank-one-pension (OROP) for the armed forces, and two, for the 2016 surgical strikes. “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Parrrikar gave the gift of OROP to our armed forces. By implementing OROP, Modi-Parrikar in a way acknowledged the tyag, tapasya and balidan of our soldiers who spend the best years of their lives protecting our borders in hostile conditions, in temperatures ranging from -43 degrees C to +43 degrees C. The guardians of our borders have now been fully reassured that their families are being taken care of by the government of India. Modi and Parrikar will be remembered for ages,” Shah said. Lauding Parrikar for placing Goa on the trajectory of fast paced development, Shah fondly recounted a conversation he once had with Goa’s former CM. “Parrikar once said to me,” Shah said, “that smaller the state, bigger should be its development. I had replied that while the belief appeared to be simple and acceptable, it was difficult to be applied in practice. Parrikar retorted saying that Goa would definitely do and prove it one day. And when he became the chief minister of Goa, he did begin transforming Goa.” Shah said following in Parrikar’s footsteps, chief minister Pramod Sawant was efficiently carrying forward Goa’s “yatra of development” even as he acknowledged the contribution of former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar in the task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shah-warns-indias-enemies-against-flirting-with-borders/articleshow/87031466.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The inquiry report is yet to be submitted.As per a copy available with TOI, the office of chief engineer (FM) of Mahagenco, Mumbai, has issued letter of award to Kohli Roadlines on October 2 for transportation of 4.5 lakh metric tonne coal from mines of Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) to Koradi, Khaparkheda and other thermal power stations of Mahagenco. The work order value is Rs13.74 crore.On September 28, executive engineer of KTPS Sudhir Punjabi had lodged a complaint with Khaparkheda police station demanding an inquiry and FIR against owner of Kohli Roadlines, Sheri Kohli, owner of truck (MH-40-BG-0901) Chabinath Singh, driver Rajan Singh, driver of truck (MH-22-AA-3414) Sanjay Sahu, employees of BMH Company, Pratik Nakhate and Atul Barapatre.As per the complaint, on receiving information from unidentified persons, it was found that a truck bearing sticker of registration no. MH-22-AA-3414 standing in the parking area of coal gate at KTPS was actually truck with registration number MH-40-BG-0901.Preliminary inquiry by Mahagenco and police revealed that truck (MH-22-AA-3414) was parked at Bhanegaon T-point. It had loaded good quality of coal from Bhanegaon mine of WCL for KTPS. And inferior quality of coal was loaded in truck (MH-40-BG-0901) from Mahalgaon coal mine and brought to KTPS.The Mahagenco alleged cheating and loss of Rs80,000 and violation of state government norms by forging the truck registration number. Mahagenco also demanded an inquiry and action against employees of BMH company which monitors trucks through GPS and RFID. GPS of truck (MH-22-AA-3414) was found in truck (MH-40-BG-0901). Also, there was no RFID in the truck.On the same day, the Mahagenco constituted a four-member inquiry committee headed by director (coal mining) Purushottam Jadhav. “Submission of inquiry report has been delayed due to coal crisis. I might submit the report on Tuesday (October 19),” he said.As per terms and conditions of the contract, Mahagenco is supposed to terminate the contract of transportation company if work is unsatisfactory on account of malpractice, quality or three more reasons. Jadhav said, “Process of new contract might have started over a month ago and completed a few days ago. The new contract will be kept on hold till inquiry is over,” he said.Sunny Kohli from Kohli Roadlines denied any malpractice or supply of inferior quality of coal. “Coal in the truck parked at KTPS was of good quality. Police have booked owner and drivers of the two trucks and conducting probe. As per my knowledge, owner of truck pasted sticker of another truck to prevent it from being seized by bank for delaying loan instalment. But some people levelled wrong allegations,” he said. Kohli said that Mahagenco is also conducting an inquiry. “We are serving Mahagenco for the last 40 years without causing any loss to it. The issue is limited only up to the truck owner and driver. My company or me are not involved,” he said.--------------------------------BLACK AS COAL* Mahagenco engaged Kohli Roadlines for transportation of coal from WCL Bhanegaon mine to KTPS* Good quality of coal loaded from Bhanegaon mine was in a truck parked near the mine* Inferior quality of coal loaded from Mahalgaon mine was brought in another truck to KTPS* Original registration number of truck that reached KTPS was different* Mahagenco lodged complaint with police which booked owner and drivers of both trucks* Four-member inquiry committee constituted * Mahagenco issued new contract to Kohli Roadlines though inquiry is pending||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/caught-diverting-good-coal-co-gets-new-contract-3-days-later/articleshow/87026606.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: APSRTC planning big to tap cargo market||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is preparing a long-term strategy to enhance its cargo services. As the recently launched doorstep delivery service is getting good response, APSRTC is planning to scale up the operations gradually with a target to double the volumes to that it is presently handling. As the operating conditions are becoming increasingly difficult with continuous rise in fuel prices and maintenance costs, the APSRTC is facing severe financial burden. Though the employee salary bill was taken off from its shoulders by the state government by merging them with the Public Transport Department, the APSRTC is still struggling to generate enough revenues to meet its financial obligations that include repayment of debts, maintenance of buses and other expenses. To keep the state-run transport corporation afloat, efforts are being made to generate additional revenues. Given the vast connectivity that it is having across the state and to major destinations in other states, the APSRTC has been developing cargo services for the last few years. Ever since the cargo service is being handled by APSRTC itself, revenues from cargo handling continue to be on the growth path every year. To take leverage of the untapped potential of cargo services, the APSRTC forayed into door-to- door service like any other courier service. The service was launched by taking local partners onboard and is being offered at 16 locations now. Speaking to TOI, vice-chairman and managing director (VC&MD) of APSRTC, Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, said that the door delivery of cargo was started with two locations as pilot and is now expanded to 16 locations that includes all district headquarters and other major cities. The have observed an uptick in volumes after the service is launched, he said. Tirumala Rao said that they wanted to scale up the services across the state in a staggered manner after studying the practical difficulties on the ground. “We do not want to go in haste but we will launch this service after analysing the market conditions and assessing the risk factors. We have seen 20 per cent increase in volumes and our target is to increase it by another 35 per cent by the end of this year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/apsrtc-planning-big-to-tap-cargo-market/articleshow/87027821.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Lucknow||BJP campaign blitz to blunt Oppn bid to ride Kheri in poll||Lucknow: With the Lakhimpur Kheri violence turning into a tipping point of the raging farm protests, BJP is all set to launch a statewide grassroots campaign to neutralize Opposition’s campaign to corner BJP in run-up to polls by “inciting farmers against the ruling dispensation”. The party will kick off the campaign by holding farmer conventions in all districts on Friday, followed by rerun of the event in all 403 assembly seats on Saturday and then in 1,918 organisational divisions on Sunday. The exercise will culminate with ‘gram chaupals’ in all 56,000 gram panchayats till the month end — a move seen as BJP’s attempt to expose Opposition’s design to make political capital out of Lakhimpur Kheri. Party leaders said, all key Opposition leaders, including SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have been yearning to score brownie points from the tragedy. “The state government has categorically maintained every person guilty of the crime will be brought to book. Yet Opposition leaders were trying to fan farmers’ sentiments,” he said. Speaking to TOI, UP BJP Kisan Morcha president Kameshwar Singh said, the objective is tell farmers about steps taken by the Centre and the state government for their welfare and “exposing kisan netas who are deliberately trying to discredit the BJP government for their political ends”. Conventions and meetings will be attended by senior state and district BJP functionaries and ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government. “We need to make the farmer community aware of the malicious motive of the Opposition and so-called farmer leaders who are peddling a false and distorted narrative about the Centre and state government,” he said. Singh’s stand comes a day after BKU leader Naresh Tikait said, farmers will continue to protest till junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra Teni is sacked. Teni’s son Ashish has been arrested for his alleged role in the Kheri incident in which eight persons, including four farmers and a journalist were killed after two SUVs ploughed through protesting farmers on October 3. Ashish and his alleged accomplice Ashish Pandey were denied bail by a magistrate’s court on Wednesday. “We are waiting for the report of the single-judge inquiry commission, which was set up by the state government a week ago,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-campaign-blitz-to-blunt-oppn-bid-to-ride-kheri-in-poll/articleshow/87031459.cms||Pankaj Shah

Officials from these institutes said even if they announce the reopening from October 20, students may not be able to join at such a short notice.The festive season would make getting a reservation difficult. The students too would like to stay with their families for celebrations.Some colleges affiliated to Nagpur University have asked students to update their vaccination status. As per norms, students who have taken both doses only would be allowed, that too after 15 days of second jab. The university has asked colleges to run vaccination drives for students in case a large number of them are unvaccinated.NFSC dean Goutham Kumar said physical classes at the college shall start from November 1 once the Nagpur University issue guidelines. “We have students from across the country enrolled for our residential programme. They require reservation to travel to city, so we plan to give them sufficient time,” he said.Government college like the Institute of Science and Institute of Forensic Science are waiting for instructions from the district administration.VNIT officials said they will decide based on hostel availability. “A few hostels are still with the NMC where it is running Covid care centre,” they said. The NU Law College hostel too are with the NMC where it may run a CCC if needed.NU officials said the departments and its three colleges were already open for the academic year while classes were being held in the online mode. “Since the government has permitted, the classes would resume in physical mode. All guidelines mentioned by the government would be followed during the normal class hours,” they said.IIM Nagpur officials said they are running hybrid classes. In hybrid classes, some students are allowed to attend the classes in-person while others attend the same session online. Students having problems in online classes are mostly allowed to stay on campus and attend classes. A pharmacy college principal said the labs won’t be available immediately while classroom size too may hinder 100% attendance. “We may have to keep some students online as not all would be able to sit with physical distancing,” he said, adding outstation students may not find a suitable place to live immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/colleges-not-ready-may-resume-physical-classes-after-diwali/articleshow/87026625.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Counsellors are getting several queries from the students daily about the confusion. After announcing the reopening of the classes, the schools were asked to conduct classes in both online and offline modes. Counsellor Manisha Anand said that students have their own logic to justify. “A student visited me last week. He was happy with the online classes and was completely against the offline classes. She gave me a stunning reply when I asked the reason for liking online classes,” said Manisha. She further said, “That student told me that she has got the habit of attending classes from home. She was not ready to wake up early and attend offline classes in school classrooms. Despite several requests by her parents, she was not convinced to attend offline classes.” She also got students who were in favour of offline classes. “A student was keen to attend offline classes as he wanted to meet his classmates. He was bored of attending monotonous classes from home. He even refused to attend classes from home. Later, his parents had to send him to school,” said Manisha. The situation has created problems for the parents. “Our only concern of continuing online classes is the safety of our children. However, its ill effects have also started coming to the fore as students have stopped liking offline classes. My child is in class 6 and she does not like offline classes. I am worried about what will happen with her once the situation improves and she has to go to school,” said Atharv Sharma, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/online-vs-offline-mode-students-in-a-fix-seek-experts-advice/articleshow/87029863.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Hyderabad||Gangrene: Need for intestinal transplants rises||Hyderabad: A sudden surge in cases of extensive intestinal gangrene, which requires removal of almost the entire small intestine, has led to an increase in need for intestinal transplantations. Doctors say that most patients suffering from this gangrene ultimately need a transplant to survive. According to available data, almost all these cases are now being reported among Covid-19 recovered patients, unlike earlier when they were found only once in a while among extremely critical patients. Doctors say the current scenario calls for a re-look at the guidelines and expertise for intestinal transplant given that there are minimal facilities available for it at the moment. “So far, there have been only six intestinal transplants done in our country, two of which were done by us at Osmania General Hospital,” said Dr C Madhusudan, head of department of gastroenterology and transplant surgeon, OGH. He added: “Doctors across the country are trying to reassess the indication for small intestine transplantation. In patients with intestinal gangrene, removal of the intestine is the only way to save them. Unless it is done, the patient will develop sepsis and die within 72 hours. However, once the intestine is removed, the patient has to be put on parental nutrition (through IV) and ultimately a transplant has to be done, as parental nutrition cannot go on for years together. It comes with risks of frequent infections and liver damage.” The problem with intestinal transplant, some experts say, is that it is far more complicated than other transplantations and there are a very few centres in the country attempting it. “This is because intestinal transplant requires a very high level of immunosuppressants unlike lung or heart transplant which requires only one or two types of immunosuppressants. In intestinal transplant we need to give four different immunosuppressants plus there is added risk of infections as once food is given, the patient is exposed to outside organisms through it,” Dr Madhusudan added. There is, of course, a small number of patients who have also survived without a transplant. Dr N Bheerappa, professor and head of department of surgical gastroenterology, Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) said, “Whether a patient requires transplant or not depends on the extent of gangrene of the small intestine. In Covid-19 recovered patients, the connecting valve between the small and large intestine is usually affected, along with a large portion of the small intestine. If this happens and the entire small intestine is removed the patient requires transplant. If a smaller portion of the small intestine suffers, in such cases we can remove the two-three feet part and join the rest of the intestine. These patients survive with special diets and medications.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gangrene-need-for-intestinal-transplants-rises/articleshow/87029883.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Doctors insert tiny ‘tube’ in fetus chest, drain out fluid from left lung||NAGPUR: A group of fetal medicine experts from the city saved an Umred family’s joy of having their first child who was detected with unexplained fluid accumulation in the left lung in the 21st week of pregnancy without complications. The fluid was detected in regular sonography and the couple had been contemplating termination until they met Dr Alhad Mohite and Dr Jitendra Sahu. Dr Mohite and Dr Sahu, both directors at Nagpur Fetal Medicine Centre (NFMC), decided to drain out the fluid using a 2-inch long shunt (a coiled tube with one end in the fetus’ chest cavity and other outside) in the 28th week. The fluid was tested to ascertain genetic disorder and other complications but no plausible cause was found. Recently, a healthy baby was born at 38 weeks (after 9 months of pregnancy) in a city hospital. The mother was operated and treated by Dr Payal Chude, a gynaecologist. Along with newborn and placenta, the tiny shunt was also removed from uterus. “During the last ultra sonography (USG), we saw the baby removing the shunt from its chest. By then the fluid had been drained out,” said Dr Mohite. Before delivery, the operating doctor and patient were instructed to ensure the shunt was also removed from the uterus. Dr Mohite and Dr Sahu claimed that the technique has been used for the first time in Central India. “Otherwise patients spend a lot on the procedure done in big cities, including cost of travel and stay,” said Dr Mohite. They said the left lung of the fetus was compressed due to mass effect of the fluid and heart was shifted to right side. No other abnormality was found, they said. As per standard protocol, genetic counseling of the couple was done by Dr Kajal Mohite, who is BGCI certified genetic counselor at NFMC, and a few tests were advised, which were to be done on fluid around the baby (amniotic fluid which is obtained by amniocentesis by putting needle into amniotic sac). “The results showed the baby did not have any genetic problem,” said Dr Mohite. A follow-up sonography was done which showed slight increase in fluid volume and decision of removing fluid from chest was taken. After the shunt was inserted, every week sonography was done. “There was no fluid, both lungs expanded well and heart was in normal position,” said Dr Sahu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-insert-tiny-tube-in-fetus-chest-drain-out-fluid-from-left-lung/articleshow/87026636.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Thackeray held a meeting with senior officials of environment and tourism department in the city over proposals for de-pollution and development of the 550-year-old lake. Of the six lakes in the city, five have been completely lost to encroachment. Ramala lake too is dying a slow death due to encroachment, pollution and accumulation of silt. Environmentalist Bandu Dhotre had staged a 12-days hunger strike to press the demand for de-pollution, deepening and cleaning of the historic lake. The agitation was called back after assurance from Thackeray. At the meeting, district collector Ajay Gulhane informed Thackeray about allocation of grants from mining development funds of district. Thackeray also issued directions to immediately clear the proposal of setting up a sewage treatment plant (STP) on the lake. The minister also gave directions to build a protection wall at the Jal Nagar side of the lake to check encroachments. He also took stock of development proposed for attracting tourists and ordered starting work for a walk-over-bridge over the lake up to Ramala garden. Dhotre, who was also present in the meeting, claimed that the conservation work can set an example for polluted and encroached lakes in others cities in the state. The meeting was attended by principal secretary, Department of Environment, Manisha Mahiskar, principal secretary, Urban Development Department, Mahesh Pathak, divisional manager, MTDC, Milind Borikar, member secretary, MPCB, Ashok Shingade, joint director, MPCB, VM Motghar.

The Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) on Thursday announced increase in the fares of autorickshaws plying in the PMC and PCMC limits and Baramati areas. For the first 1.5kms after the start of the ride, commuters will have to pay a fare of Rs20, an increase of Rs2 from the earlier Rs. 18. “From November 8, the meter reading will start at Rs20. Furthermore, the per km fare after the first 1.5km will be Rs13. At present, the rate is Rs12.19,” an RTO official told TOI. Sources said the decision was taken at a recent meeting of the Regional Transport Authority, which is headed by the collector. Nitin Pawar of Rickshaw Panchayat, the largest autorickshaw union in the district, said the increased fares were unsatisfactory. “The prices of CNG are at an all-time high now. The RTA should have thought about the fare increase keeping in mind the the CNG prices. The autorickshaw fare hike should have been more,” Pawar told TOI. On Thursday, a litre of CNG in Pune shot up to Rs62.50 per kg from Rs59.50. Shrikant Acharya, president of the Aam Aadmi Rickshaw Chalak Sanghatna, said, “The RTA meeting had discussion on the arm-twisting attitude of the finance firms, who were forcibly taking away autorickshaws from owners for non-payment of dues.” Gautam Waghle, an autorickshaw driver said, “Going by the increased CNG prices, the autorickshaw fare hike should have been more.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/autorickshaw-rides-to-get-dearer-from-november-8/articleshow/87029890.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Dehradun||Power blackouts in U'khand hurting industrial units||Dehradun: Power outages have increased in some areas of the state in the past few days. On Wednesday, several rural areas and industrial units suffered an unscheduled power cut for two hours. The owners of manufacturing units have said that they would face economic losses if the power supply continues to remain erratic. SIDCUL manufacturer’s association president, Harindra Garg, told TOI that the power crunch has started to impact the functioning of industries. “About 4-to-5 hours of unscheduled power cuts is reducing our output by 30-35%. The units were already reeling under the Covid-19 impact and now, power shortage is impeding our economic recovery,” said Garg. The development comes in the wake of coal stocks in power plants across the country falling to unprecedented low levels. Nearly 80% of the country’s coal-fired plants are in the critical stage, meaning their stocks could run out in a few days, as per the Central Electricity Authority of India data. However, Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) officials maintain that the situation is likely to improve from Friday. According to UPCL, a shortage of power supply from hydro-power generation projects has led to the energy crisis and efforts are on to bridge the power transmission gaps. Satish Chand, director, projects and nodal officer, commercial, UPCL, told TOI, “We have decided to purchase power from open markets to arrange power for November and December in advance. For this, we will float short-term tenders.” When asked about the power supply arrangements during the upcoming festivals, he said, “On usual days, the state consumes 40 million units of power. On Friday, we expect the consumption to go up by 3.1 million units. Therefore, we have already arranged for 2.3 million extra units of power. In case of any shortfall, we will arrange power supply from the real-time market.” (With inputs from Sheo S Jaiswal)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/power-blackouts-in-ukhand-hurting-industrial-units/articleshow/87027845.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Lucknow||Unrelenting Varun tweets Atal video backing farmers||Lucknow: Dropped from party’s national executive earlier this month, BJP MP Varun Gandhi, who has been calling for “justice” for families of farmers killed in violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, is in no mood to relent. On Thursday, he tweeted an undated video clip of BJP stalwart and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee warning the government against intimidating farmers. “Wise words from a big-hearted leader,” said Varun, while tweeting the video of 1980 in which Vajpayee cautioned the then Indira Gandhi government against repressing farmers. “Warn the government against intimidating farmers. Don’t try to scare us... Farmers are not going to be scared. We don’t want to use the farmers’ movement for politics,” Vajpayee can be heard saying in the video. “We support their genuine demands, and if the government tries to scare us, or misuse laws or disregard the peaceful movement of farmers, we will also become part of the movement,” he said. Varun’s mother and Sultanpur MP Maneka Gandhi and former Union Minister Birender Singh have been sympathetic towards the farmers’ protests against the Centre’s laws. The Pilibhit MP, in fact, is the only BJP member to speak up on Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, has been arrested. Last week, he tweeted a video of the black SUV ploughing through a group of peaceful protesters, saying protestors cannot be silenced through “murder”. He had also criticized attempts to give the Kheri incident a “Hindu versus Sikh” spin. Earlier, he wrote to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding a CBI probe and Rs 1 crore compensation for farmers, who got killed in the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/unrelenting-varun-tweets-atal-video-backing-farmers/articleshow/87031461.cms||Pankaj Shah

About 75% of construction work of two sections is done, and the rest will get done by the end of October, said forest officials. The new facility aims to provide timely treatment to wild animals that get injured in the Pune region while crossing roads or in other circumstances. At present, forest officials take them to Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park facility run by an NGO. The new hospital will have three operation theatres as well as isolation rooms and a post-mortem section for the injured animal. “It will also be equipped with 16 open cages, where under-treatment animals will be kept under observation. These cages will have enough space so that the animal can move within them. This would enable us to understand the progress of the health post-treatment,” said a forest official in the know. The facility is spread over about 22 acres of land and will have 16 units. Another forest official added, “We have sent a separate proposal to the state government to create a leopard section, considering the presence of this big cat in and around city limits.” “Huge workload and lack of manpower, including veterinarians, often resulted in delays of medical treatment for wildlife in Pune. This facility will address concerns,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/forest-dept-to-get-new-veterinary-hosp-mammal-section-by-oct-end/articleshow/87029878.cms||---

The rally was to mark the conclusion of ‘Sankalp Samaj Utthaan Aarakshan Yatra’ launched by the party on September 15. It will now be held at Ramabai rally ground on November 15 and a few senior BJP leaders may also attend it, said a party leader. “The yatra is continuing to drum up support for the party’s demand for reservation for the Nishad community,” Dr Sanjay Nishad, national president. At the time of the launch of the yatra, the party president had said that the yatra was meant to remind the BJP of the Nishad Party’s demand for reservation. If BJP fails to address the issue, I will be the last Nishad standing in BJP’s support, he had said. Now with Bharatiya Janata Party officially announcing its alliance with the Nishad Party, nominating Dr Sanjay Nishad as MLC and also assuring that it is working on the legalities to grant reservation to the Nishad community, what purpose will the Nishad Party’s yatra serve now? “We have not got the reservation yet. It will remain an issue till it is resolved,” said the party president, adding, “The rally will be the party’s show of strength for all.” On other Nishad-centric parties such as Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) also demanding reservation for Nishads in UP, Sanjay Nishad said, “I am happy that more and more people are demanding reservation.” “Mere khet mein koi doosra ped laga bhi de toh khet mere hi rahega (If someone plants a tree in my field, it would still remain my land),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-defers-oct-15-lucknow-rally-to-nov-15/articleshow/87031469.cms||Neha Shukla

The state capital will be connected with Rewa under the regional connectivity scheme (RCS), besides Raipur. After the addition of two new flights, the frequency of flights per day from Bhopal will be rise from 30 to 34. Director Bhopal airport KL Agarwal said that Bhopal airport is fast coming back to normal after the covid shadow. “After DGCA allowed airlines to operate with 100% capacity, the chances for more connectivity from Bhopal airport has increased. We have seen an increase in both flight movements as well as in footfall,” said Agarwal. Talking about the Rewa flight, Agarwal said, “We have got intimation of air connectivity with Rewa. An agency has also been selected to run the services. However, other details are yet to come. I am hoping that the operation will start by the end of this year.” He said that the connectivity will be under RCS. Notably, under RCS plans are to connect underserved airports to key airports through flights that will cost less. RCS envisages providing subsidies to airlines to offer these fares. The regional connectivity scheme is applicable on route length between 200 to 800 km with no lower limit set for hilly, remote, island and security sensitive regions. About the Raipur flight, director Agarwal said that IndiGo will start flights from November 2. “It will run on all days in the week,” said director Agarwal. Notably, Bhopal airport seems to be catching up to pre-Covid level and has resumed its normal services after almost 18 months of lockdown. This could be gauged from the fact that from no flights in April 2020 after the first lockdown was imposed the Bhopal’s Raja Bhopal airport has touched 560 flight movement in August 2021. Same is true about passengers’ footfall. This could be gauged from the fact that in April 2020 the footfall was 0, while it touched 64,112 in August 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/flights-from-bhopal-to-rewa-raipur-to-start-by-year-end/articleshow/87029897.cms||---

But to be on the safer side, we considered 34 lakh eligible people residing in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits. Of them, we have vaccinated almost 31.50 lakh with one dose. We are making use of television, radio, newspapers, and other tools to reach out to the unvaccinated,” said PMC’s chief immunization officer Suryakant Devkar. Despite the vaccine being offered for free at PMC-run centres, fear about side-effects and myths are reasons for hesitancy. “Some residents have fixed ideas and it is difficult to convince them. We are doing every bit to cover the unvaccinated,” Devkar said. The state government announced a mega vaccination drive from October 8 and 14, under Mission Kavach Kundal, to speed up inoculation across the state. “We have carried out the mega drive so that those left out get easy access. Besides, we also carried out a 75-hour-long marathon vaccination drive at PMC-run Kamla Nehru and Sutar hospitals this month so that people busy with work can find a convenient time to get the shot,” Devkar said. Since there is online access to vaccination slots, residents can go to any place throughout the district to get the shot. “PMC has a lot of floating population and migrant workers. Despite all odds, we want to ensure that everyone is immunised,” Devkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-5l-yet-to-get-covid-shot-in-pmc-areas-officials-deploy-mass-media/articleshow/87029920.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Civil judge Mahesh P Saraf pronounced this order on October 11 and asked the bank to pay plaintiff Diwaliben Narotam Rs 25,000. According to case details, the plaintiff had defaulted Rs 16.66 lakh of DMC while paying monthly instalment as per tender conditions. The woman had won a tender of the vegetable market in an auction near Bandar chowk of the union territory which allowed her to collect tax from the vendors. The businesswoman is also engaged in the local hotel industry. Narottam has been maintaining a savings account with ICICI bank for the past 25 years, but in October 2018 she was disallowed to operate her account causing her ‘wrongful losses’. The bank steadfastly maintained that they will only allow her to operate the account after she provides them with a written letter or instruction from the DMC. In its order, the court noted: “The defendant (bank) has no such legal right nor any banking laws permits the defendant to freeze any savings bank account without the order of the court, or directions of Reserve Bank of India or concerned police machinery who is legally bound to obtain permission of the court to freeze the bank account.” The bank also failed to produce an order of the chief officer of DMC directing it to freeze a particular account. The court further stated that the bank ‘has no legal right to act as a recovery agent’. “There is no document to show privity of the contract between the defendant bank and the DMC to take action of freezing the bank account of its consumer for the alleged default on the part of the plaintiff in the capacity of tax collecting contractor,” the order stated. Advocate of the plaintiff, Manoj Chudasama told TOI, “The court order termed the act of defendant bank’s freezing the plaintiff’s saving account as void and illegal and asked bank to pay cost of Rs 25,000 to plaintiff as litigation expense.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/diu-court-tells-bank-not-to-act-as-recovery-agent/articleshow/87027865.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

While Lokayukta believes that the submissions need a relook, many officers who were earlier associated with the organization have a different opinion. “Only a judge of the special court can decide whether a closure report should be accepted,” said a former Lokayukta officer. This is the first such ‘review’ since Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta came into existence nearly 30 years ago. “The final closure reports in Class-III and Class-IV employees’ cases were filed before various special courts in bulk in the last one and a half years without application of mind. Therefore, it is directed that in future, final closure reports in trap and disproportionate assets cases of Class-III and IV employees shall be placed before Lokayukta before approval,” reads a ‘standing order’ issued by Justice N K Gupta on October 11.

Vending zones have been marked at Nehru Colony, Mehant Indresh road, Lal pull Patel Nagar, Seema Dwar, Patribagh chowk, Doon vihar and Raipur Chungi. But vendors say they find it easier to sell goods at places that suit them. “I set up my stall around 10 am and most of my vegetables are gone by lunch time. There is no need for me to go to a vending zone as I get enough buyers here,” said Ramesh Dimri, a vegetable seller along New road. Getting a licence is taxing, says Dharamkant, another seller in Dalanwala. “I pay a meagre sum as rent to a grocer, who lets me set up my stall outside his shop. Getting a licence and going to a specific area to sell my produce is something I am not in favour of. I have been doing fine here,” he said. Vendors in the city claim it is easy for them to roam around and sell stuff. “My husband and I start from Saharapur chowk, go to railway station, sell goods and get home by late evening. If anyone asks us to remove our vend, we shift it,” said Sushila Devi, a utensil seller, who has been doing the job for the past five years. Dehradun Municipal Corporation had issued 243 vendor licences last year for seven designated zones. Fifteen more vending areas are proposed in the city. “As soon as the places are finalised, we will start issuing fresh licences,” said deputy municipal commissioner Rohilash Sharma. While civic body claims it keeps issuing warnings to vendors operating without a licence, vendors do not budge, it says. “We confiscate stalls of habitual offenders. Strict action is taken for illegal occupation of a place. If a vendor is willing to move, we issue a licence,” said a civic body official. A licence is issued for a year and has to be renewed. Those operating in no-vending zones can have their licences cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/licensing-vending-zones-all-greek-to-street-sellers-in-doon/articleshow/87027874.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Over 60,000 residents of the area had been demanding the centre for long. Sources say the cost of the project has been estimated at Rs 10 crore and that it will come up under the National Health Mission. While 90% of the amount is to come from the central government, the state government will bear the remaining 10%. Chorus for the centre, being demanded for over a decade, gained momentum in 2016 when Harish Rawat was the chief minister. Though BJP mayor Manoj Garg had offered 20,000 sq ft land for a hospital opposite Pawan Dham in north Haridwar, it was not accepted by health department as crores of rupees were required to be paid to the corporation for the land. In 2020, mayor Anita Sharma from the Congress got a resolution passed awarding 32,000 sq ft land for a hospital at the same place for free. Following this, government decided in favour of setting up a hospital in the area, Ashok Sharma, a municipal councillor said. Ratan Mani Dobhal, a resident of the area, welcomed the decision, saying, "BJP mayor failed to do what Anita Sharma did when BJP was in power." According to sources, effort will be made to get the hospital functional in the shortest possible time.

---||Lucknow||Rajnath Singh meets 106-year-old Jana Sangh ex-MLA||NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday called on 106-year-old Shri Narayan alias Bhulai Bhai, probably BJP’s seniormost worker, who was a contemporary of party ideologues Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay and had twice been a Jana Sangh MLA. Bhulai Bhai had sought time with Singh. However, the latter, as a gesture of respect to the party veteran, called on him at UP Sadan in the national capital. “I am feeling younger after meeting my old party colleague and a long time friend Rajnath Singh … It’s a feeling like Krishna has come to meet Sudama,” an emotional Bhulai Bhai said while meeting the defence minister. Rajnath Singh said, “I came to meet Bhulai Bhai. Probably, he is the oldest among all the BJP workers of the time of Jana Sangh in the country. In 1977, when I was an MLA, he was also an MLA.” The two leaders spent almost an hour together. Singh was elected first time MLA from Mirzapur in 1977. Bhulai Bhai was elected as MLA from Naurangia in Kushinagar district in 1974 and 1977. Singh told Bhulai Bhai that he was equally delighted to meet someone who had been a senior party leader and was a vocal leader on issues of eastern UP. A Dalit leader, who was in the limelight as state legislator since he raised issues in the state assembly in Bhojpuri, Bhilai Bhai was recently in headlines when Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him to take stock of his health. As a goodwill gesture, Modi had called several party veterans to express gratitude for their contributions during initial days of the Jana Sangh and later BJP. Bhulai Bhai had joined erstwhile Jana Sangha on Vijaydashmi around 70 years ago and worked with the founders of BJP, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Coincidentally, his meeting with Rajnath Singh was also on the eve of Dussehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rajnath-meets-106-yr-old-jana-sangh-ex-mla/articleshow/87031490.cms||---

One of the accused has been arrested, police said. The incident was reported on Monday when the constable, Mohit Kumar, was returning home on his bike. His motorcycle was hit by a car near Durgapuri Chowk in Jyoti Nagar. “I fell off and received minor injuries. My bike was damaged too,” the complainant told police. Kumar picked his bike and started chasing the accused’s car and was able to stop the vehicle on Wazirabad service road. Kumar found that the driver was talking over phone and did not even realise he had hit the bike. When Kumar questioned him about the act, the accused still did not respond. The accused then called five youths to the spot. “The driver came out of the car and, together, they attacked Kumar. They also threatened him with dire consequences,” an officer said, adding they then fled with Kumar’s bike key.  A case under sections 279, 337, 306, 506 and 34 IPC was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/constable-thrashed-by-group-after-bike-car-collide-1-held/articleshow/87030030.cms||---

The Hospital Chowk, one of the busiest crossroads in the city connecting two highways has been closed for last one year due to of construction of a flyover bridge. According to Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), the flyover bridge work is expected to continue for one more year. Currently, commuters are facing problems in reaching important places especially courts, civil hospital and collector office. For cars and heavy vehicles, the traffic has been diverted through Amul Circle and Dhebar Road, while auto and two-wheelers are using narrow lanes to reach the destinations. Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said that they are planning to find an alternate way to reduce traffic woes. He visited the site on Wednesday and has decided to develop an internal road to divert traffic. The cars that come from Parevdi Chowk will be given diversion to the service road on the right side after Kesari bridge and a road connecting the old collector office to this service road will be developed. This road via Rukhadiya Colony touches the Junction Main road. However, this road being narrow, only one-way traffic will be allowed. RMC is constructing the flyover bridge at Hospital Chow at the cost of Rs 60 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hospital-chowk-to-be-freed-from-traffic-snarls/articleshow/87027981.cms||---

This is the fourth incident of its kind within a month, in which thieves targeted unmanned ATM kiosks of the same non-banking finance company. While the latest incident is in the Lonikand area under Pune city police’s jurisdiction, the earlier three incidents were reported from Ambegaon taluka, Mandavgan Farata in Shirur and Khadki in Daund — all in Pune rural areas. “We are not ruling out the possibility of one and the same gang involved in all these cases,” a Pune rural police officer said. Superintendent of police, Pune rural, Abhinav Deshmukh said, “Three ATM units of this firm have been targeted by the suspects in the recent past. We have written to the company to adopt technology-based security measures and to employ security guards.”  Sub-inspector Suraj Gore of the Lonikand police told TOI on Thursday, “The finance firm is yet to furnish us a report on the amount stolen.” TOI also tried to speak with a senior company officer based in Pune, but he did not respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gas-cutter-used-to-break-open-atm/articleshow/87030021.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi should explain why he rushed to meet Amit Shah and walk into a trap: Sunil Jakhar||JALANDHAR: A day after criticising Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi over the Centre’s move to empower the Border Security Force (BSF) to operate up to an area of 50 km inside Indian territory along the Indo-Pak border in the state, former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar again questioned him on Thursday and urged him to explain why he had gone to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and why he had made the specific demand about ‘sealing’ the border. Jakhar, who was replaced by Navjot Singh Sidhu as the PPCC chief, said, “The CM should explain to the people of Punjab what was the need for him to go to Union home minister in the first place when he had already raised the same issues in his meeting with the Prime Minister a few days back. The fresh issue he raised with HM was asking him to seal the international border. What was the urgency to meet HM, raise this issue and walk into a trap?” “By doing this, the CM has buttressed the narrative built by former CM Captain Amarinder Singh for four-and-a-half years and provided much-needed ground to the Union government to increase the jurisdiction of BSF in the state,” he added. Be careful what you ask for ! Has @CHARANJITCHANNI unwittingly managed to handover half of Punjab to Central govt.… https://t.co/SO61xTnrEM— Sunil Jakhar (@sunilkjakhar) 1634120064000Jakhar had tweeted on Wednesday: “Be careful what you ask for! Has Charanjit Singh Channi unwittingly managed to hand over half of Punjab to the central government… Do we still want more autonomy to states?” He was referring to Channi’s request to Shah to “seal the international border with Punjab to curb trafficking of drugs and weapons,” when he had called on him on October 5. Jakhar’s tweet questioning the CM had raised a storm not just within the Congress but also among other parties and the CM had to condemn the Union government’s move by late Wednesday evening. Asked if it could be a case of inexperience as he had mentioned “unwittingly” in his previous tweet, Jakhar quipped, “Let’s hope chair will make the man.” The signs were dangerous for Punjab and apprehensions of the people were not misplaced, Jakhar said. “You have to see this decision in the context of instructions by the Karnal SDM to ‘break heads of farmers’, then Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar also provoking people to pick up lathis and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman arguing that partial lamenting over Lakhimpur Kheri episode was not correct. They are very arrogant. With the latest decision of the Union government in this background, one can understand their real intent and its consequences. It is the beginning of the end of federalism and more harsher measures and repression appear to be coming for Punjab as the state is known as the fountainhead of resistance to repression. They have to be watched as BSF is not police but a security force and not trained for policing civilians. The Union government in place of denying these apprehensions in the minds of Punjabis should rather address these,” Jakhar argued. Amarinder a ‘leader in transition’ Asked about the stand taken by former CM Captain Amarinder Singh to justify the MHA decision, Jakhar said whatever the former had said should not be taken as any contradiction or squabbling within Congress. “He has already made it clear that he would leave Congress and he is a leader in transition,” he remarked, Notably, Jakhar had given up his post of Congress Legislature Party leader in 2015 to facilitate Amarinder’s reappointment as Punjab Congress chief and Channi had replaced Jakhar on the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-should-explain-why-he-rushed-to-meet-shah-and-walk-into-a-trap-jakhar/articleshow/87031523.cms||IP Singh

In her police complaint against 11 persons, including her husband and in-laws, she has claimed that in 2003 her husband had kidnapped her from home after drugging her parents. He had also taken her gold ornaments. Later, she was taken to Jabalpur where she was forcibly married to him in an Arya Samaj temple in presence of his relatives. She further claimed that her husband continuously thrashed and tortured her from the very first day of the marriage. After getting pregnant, she was asked to get aborted but when she refused, her in-laws stopped giving her food. She somehow survived by taking food from the neighbours. After giving birth to a daughter, she was again subjected to continuous torture. After she conceived once more, her husband thrashed her severely and tried to damage her private part. Her in-laws tried to kill her on several occasions by dosing her with kerosene oil, by poisoning her and by trying to throw acid but each time she survived, she claimed in the police complaint. She further mentioned in the complaint that her husband used to sodomise her son also apart from taking her daughter to various places after her school and trying to sell her and coaxing her to “go to one Tilak’s place and he will make you rich”. On the basis of the complaint, police have lodged an FIR against several persons, including the husband, sister-in-law and mother-in-law of the woman under sections 498A, 366, 323, 506 , 326 377 of IPC besides Section 4/5 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.

Its exit from Mumbai and Pune was nearly six to seven days late compared to normal withdrawal dates. The normal date for monsoon withdrawal from the state is around October 5. As per normal withdrawal dates, by October 10, the monsoon exit covers most parts of Maharashtra, east MP, north Chhattisgarh, east UP, most of Bihar and Jharkhand, and some parts of Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal; by October 15, the withdrawal covers most of the country. The normal withdrawal date is October 8 for Mumbai and October 9 for Pune. “The southwest monsoon further withdrew from some more parts of Telangana, the remaining parts of Marathwada, Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan, some parts of North Interior Karnataka and most parts of Central Arabian Sea on Thursday,” Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD-Pune, told TOI. He said Pune was likely to see partly cloudy to mainly clear skies over the next few days, and there was a lower chance of rains in the coming. “Temperatures are likely to rise in major parts of Maharashtra with the exit of the monsoon and clear skies. Pune would see mercury rising to 34-35°C during the next few days. All districts are already showing a rising trend in temperatures,” he said. An IMD update on Thursday said a low-pressure area lay over westcentral and northwest Bay of Bengal. It is likely to move west-northwest and reach south Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh coasts during the next 12 hours. “Under its influence, light to moderate rainfall with isolated thunderstorms could be seen in parts of Vidarbha and Marathwada during October 16-18.

The MLA said, “Three men of my assembly segment Tindwari, who had gone fishing in the sea in Porbandar in Gujarat, have been arrested recently by the Pakistani Army. As the family members of all three fishermen are in utter pain and shock, on humanitarian grounds I have written to the PM and Home Minister seeking their early and safe release from Pakistan jail.” To recall, three Banda natives — Chand Babu and Laxman of Dhausad village and Shailendra Kumar of Jasaipur — were arrested by the Pakistani Army on reaching the Pakistan border while catching fish in the sea in Porbandar in Gujarat.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Solar energy finds more takers after power cuts, soaring tariffs||VIJAYAWADA: With power prices skyrocketing and power cuts round the corner, people are tending towards solar power. Demand for net metered systems increased by 15 per cent in the last ten days and the sellers have started to offer special discounts on select models. Solar power is the cheapest and most efficient source of power generation. Despite the huge publicity given by the government to the net metering systems, people were averse to solar panels due to their price. A 3 kilowatt solar system with net metering can generate up to 13 units of power per day and costs around Rs 1.3 lakh. Despite subsidy offers by the government, people chose not to buy solar power systems. But the situation changed with the proposed power cuts. “We have arranged many demonstrations and stalls at exhibitions explaining the benefits of the solar power system, in the past. But people didn’t care. But the situation changed after the sudden hike in power tariffs and true-up charges imposed by the government. We sold 35 units this month till date, while we sold only eight units in September 2021,” said Md Irfan who runs a solar power systems unit. Buyers are showing interest in net metering system considering the long-term benefits. “ Solar companies are offering 20 years of warranty for panels. We usually consume 250 units per month. We installed a 3 kV system and our power bill was reduced by 85 per cent. We can get back our investment by saving on power bill within three years,” said John Vikram, a buyer from Poranki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/solar-energy-finds-more-takers-after-power-cuts-soaring-tariffs/articleshow/87027968.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Chandigarh||revisedAmarinder hand in glove with BJP: Pargat||Chandigarh: A day after the Union government increased the jurisdiction of BSF in Punjab, cabinet minister Pargat Singh lashed out at former Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, accusing him of being hand in glove with the BJP. Contrary to the stand taken by the government and opposition parties, Captain Amarinder on Wednesday had lauded the move stating that it would safeguard the borders. While speaking with media persons, Pargat said the move was intended to project Punjab as a disturbed state and enforce the governor’s rule. Taking a potshot at the former chief minister, the school and higher education minister said the Centre took two decisions that were not in the interest of the state after Captain Amarinder went to Delhi. “Paddy procurement was delayed by 10 days after he met Union home minister Amit Shah and when he went to Delhi for the second time, BSF’s jurisdiction has been increased,” Pargat said. “What is Captain sahib trying to prove? I always said he is with the BJP,” he added. Questioning the timing of the move, the minister said the order did not come when Captain was in power for 4.5 years. Requesting the ex-chief minister to not indulge in such activities, he said, “Captain sahib we respect you a lot. Please do not do this.” Issuing a stern warning to the BJP, Pargat said people would not let Punjab become a disturbed state and allow the saffron party succeed in its plan. “The BJP’s polarisation policy will not work in Punjab, which is the land of Guru Nanak Dev’s ideology,” he said. Regarding the competence of Punjab Police, he said it was well prepared and equipped to handle any situation. However, he accepted that there are few black sheep that needed to be identified and weeded out of the department. “We have a very capable chief minister and home minister, who can tackle any situation,” he said. EVASIVE ON SIDHU Pargat, who is considered close to Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, tried to evade questions regarding his reported unhappiness with the party’s functioning in the state and scheduled meeting with senior leaders of Delhi. Requesting the media to discuss the issue on some other day, he said Sidhu was going to Delhi to discuss party structure and other matters with the high command. “Who else than the state party president will take up such issues with the high command?” he quipped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/revisedamarinder-hand-in-glove-with-bjp-pargat/articleshow/87031538.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Centre orders probe into illegal tree felling in Corbett Tiger Reserve||DEHRADUN: The Centre has ordered a probe into allegations of illegal tree felling and construction work undertaken in Corbett Tiger Reserve to set up a tiger safari envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The idea for a tiger safari through the reserve was mooted by the PM during his shoot of an episode of ‘Man Vs Wild’ for Discovery channel at the tiger reserve in 2019. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a Supreme Court-appointed panel and the Uttarakhand forest department have already initiated separate probes into the allegations. Directions for the latest inquiry were sent by Charan Jeet Singh, scientist at the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, to the head of its integrated regional office (MoEF Uttarakhand) on October 12. The written communique has asked the office to examine the matter and submit a factual report with “specific comments” within two weeks so further action can be taken. The letter also mentioned that the stage II clearance to the project — which allows transfer of the forest land for non-forestry activity — was given only “recently” on September 10. A month before that, in August, a plea in National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had alleged illegal tree felling and construction in Corbett. The plea filed by Supreme Court advocate and activist Gaurav Bansal on August 26 this year had alleged that in order to use the land in Corbett’s Pakhro block (Sonanadi range) for non-forestry activity, a stage II clearance was required from the forest advisory committee under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. It alleged that work had started in the area without following due procedure. Uttarakhand had first sought approval from the MoEF for its first tiger safari which would provide a ‘sure-shot glimpse’ of the big cat to visitors in 2019. In its submission, the state had said that 163 trees would be felled for the project. The green signal for the Pakhro safari was given and work began soon after. Bansal had alleged that the project is spread over 106 hectares and thousands of trees have been felled to set up the safari. He alleged it was in violation of a Supreme Court order in 2001 which stated that no tree in CTR should be felled “under any circumstance by the state or anyone else”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/centre-orders-probe-into-illegal-tree-felling-in-ctr-for-pms-pet-tiger-safari/articleshow/87027984.cms||Shivani Azad

Leader of opposition in state assembly Harpal Singh Cheema demanded that CM Charanjit Singh Channi convene an all-party meeting in this regard. He also called for a special assembly session to condemn and pass a resolution for rollback of the decision. In centralization of everything and robbing the rights of the state by the Union government, BJP has surpassed the Congress, Cheema alleged. He claimed an unannounced emergency-like situation had been created by the Modi government and it was a very big step of the government to have an indirect control on Punjab. “Earlier also, the Union government had enacted black agriculture laws without the consent of the states on the issue of agriculture under their jurisdiction, thus robbing them of their rights,” he added. Cheema said the decision will affect six districts of Punjab — Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Amritsar City, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur and Fazilka. He said out of the total 50,632 square kilometre area of the state, an estimated 27,600 square kilometre area would come under the BSF’s purview.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/revisedaap-demands-special-assembly-session/articleshow/87031531.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Treat daughters and sisters like goddess’||Gorakhpur: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath performed Kanya pujan of girls as chief priest of Gorakhnath temple on Navami of Navratra on Thursday morning at the temple premises. He invited nine little girls to the temple, washed their feet, and performed Kanya Pujan, served them lunch and gave them dakshina. He also served lunch to Batuk. While talking to the media, the chief minister stressed on the need of practicing faith and devotion for sisters and daughters as it can control crime against women. “We all should have the feeling of ‘Goddess’ like sanctity and faith for our daughters and sisters and this should be practiced and propagated. If we see them as manifestations of Goddess, frequent crime incidents against sisters and daughters could be controlled,” the chief minister said. Kanyaa pujan is a ritual, carried out on the eighth and ninth day of Navaratra. It primarily involves the worship of nine girls, representing the nine forms of Durga. He appealed to the people to join hands for education, health, security and self dependency of women and praised PM Narendra Modi for launching flagship scheme ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ for paving the way for women empowerment. Enumerating schemes of the government like Kanya Sumangala Yojana, he said the scheme empowers women by ensuring a monetary aid of Rs 15,000 in phases for education up to graduation. Yogi said the government, under Mukhya Mantri Samuhik Vivah Yojna, had solemnized marriages of over 1.75 lakh women. Yogi also extended greetings of Vijayadashmi to people and said, “Even the biggest powers could be defeated by walking on the path of truth, justice and dharma and it certainly ensures victory.” Yogi had installed kalash on the first day of Navratra at Shaktipeeth in Gorakhnath temple and on Wednesday (Ashtami) he had performed the Mahanisha Puja.

---||Chandigarh||Akalis protest outside Punjab Raj Bhawan, call for all-party meet||CHANDIGARH/PATIALA: SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and other party leaders on Thursday courted arrest after a sit-in near a barricaded Punjab Raj Bhawan, accusing chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi of colluding with the Centre to extended BSF’s jurisdiction to “half the state”. Sukhbir alleged that this was the Centre’s second quick infringement of Punjab’s rights after the three agri-marketing laws “and now it will take effective control of law and order in half the state through the BSF, which is an attack on the country’s federal structure”. “Shrines like Darbar Sahib, Durgiana Mandir and Ram Tirath will come under the central control. The SAD will oppose it,” he said. He also accused the CM of selling off Punjab’s interests in his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on October 5 “for a few more months in office”. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said state home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had, as minister for prisons, supported a similar move of handing over the control of jails to the CRPF, and now his own village would be under the control of central forces. In Patiala, former MP and senior SAD vice-president Prem Singh Chandumajra accused the Centre of trying to make Punjab a paramilitary state and suggested that the state government call an all-party meeting to condemn the move. “The Punjab assembly should convene to register its discontent with the Centre. Union home minister Amit Shah has taken advantage of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s ignorance and inexperience. Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has also highlighted it in his statement.” Claiming that the Centre’s decision was a sign of distrust in police and civil administration, Chandumajra said, “The Punjabis, who pick up arms to defend the frontiers and protect the country’s pride and dignity by sacrificing their lives, oppose this decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/revisedsad-protests-outside-pb-raj-bhawan-calls-for-all-party-meet/articleshow/87031547.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Directorate of education issues circular with SOPs for physical classes||PANAJI: Following the chief minister’s announcement, the directorate of education (DoE) on Thursday issued a circular allowing schools to hold physical classes for students from Class IX to XII, starting from October 18. The directives state that initially schools can opt to operate in a hybrid mode, which will mean carrying out teaching in a mix of online and offline sessions. The circular also states that online teaching-learning material should be made available to any children who do not want to attend physical classes. “The government, after consultation with expert committee, has decided to allow reopening of schools from Class IX to XII (physical format) from October 18by following the mentioned guidelines/SOPs. The heads of institutions and managements are requested to take their own decision taking into consideration available infrastructure and local condition. Schools may, if required, initially follow a hybrid mode of teaching i.e. online as well as offline classes,” director Bhushan Savaikar has said. Schools functions and assemblies are to be avoided until further advisory is issued, Savaikar has said. “For students who choose not to attend physical school, recorded class lessons and any other online mode of teaching may be followed,” the circular reads. The timetable should be prepared by schools in such a manner that there will be no crowding in the school, state the guidelines. “Schools, if required, may schedule classes/timetable in both shifts taking into consideration available infrastructure and local conditions,” the circular reads. “High risk children (those suffering from chronic diseases like asthma, kidney diseases, disabled children, children on steroids etc) should consult their pediatrician/physician before joing the schools. Students/teachers/staff having symptoms of Covid-19 shall be advised to have test immediately,” the SOPs state. Only vaccinated staff (teaching and non-teaching) should be allowed in the school premises. Those who cannot produce vaccination certificate should be allowed inside the school complex only after producing negative report of RT-PCR test. Such negative test report will be valid for seven days, the DoE has said. “All the adult members working at and closely associated with schools, including the teachers, non-teaching staff, support staff, commute drivers, attendants and school visitors should have received at least one dose of any Covid-19 vaccine,” the directorate norms state. Isolation, testing and contact tracing of symptomatic school attendees should be carried out as per health guidelines, the director has said. DoE has said that schools should frame their own SOPs, if required, taking into consideration infrastructure available and local circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/doe-issues-circular-with-sops-for-physical-classes/articleshow/87031546.cms||---

While his associate has also been arrested, the woman is absconding. The two arrested men have been identified as Parvinder alias Himanshu, who supplies vegetables from Okhla Mandi to local vendors, and Akash alias Ashu, who works with a government institution. A country-made pistol with a live cartridge and a mobile phone was seized from them. On October 10, Akash called head constable Ram Prasad and reported that his friend, Parvinder, and he had caught a man with a country-made pistol while he was trying to rob a vegetable vendor in Okhla Sabzi Mandi. They told the cop that they were bringing the alleged robber, Mohit. “When Akash and Parvinder handed over Mohit with the country-made pistol to the cop, Prasad sensed something amiss. He brought them to the police station. Soon, cops noticed that Mohit had bruises on his body. When they questioned him, he said Parvinder, Akash and their associates took him into the basement of a building at Okhla Sabzi Mandi and thrashed him brutally. They even made a video,” said a senior police officer. After the video was found on one of their cellphones, cops checked WhatsApp chats in Parvinder’s phone. It was seen that a woman had been instructing them to make the video and frame Mohit for robbery. On interrogation, Parvinder and Akash confessed that they and their associates took Mohit to the basement owned by a friend. They beat up Mohit and made videos keeping three bundles of Rs 500 notes and the pistol on a table next to him. Further inquiry revealed that Mohit’s wife was in an extramarital affair with Parvinder. She had planned the conspiracy to frame her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-frames-lovers-hubby-in-robbery-case-2-arrested/articleshow/87030075.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Two men arrested on charge of murdering their techie friend||PUNE: Two persons were arrested on Wednesday night on the charge of killing their friend in a Kondhwa Budruk society on October 10 and destroying evidence. The incident came to light when the Kondhwa police received a call on October 11 informing that a firing incident had occurred in the society on the evening of October 10. The police found software engineer, Ganesh Yashwant Tarlekar (47), dead. The Sassoon General Hospital, in its post-mortem report, certified the cause of Tarlekar’s death due to bullet injuries sustained to his left chin and brain, police said. Senior inspector Sardar Patil of the Kondhwa police told TOI, “We arrested the duo, Sagar Binavat (33) and Dattatraya Hajare (47), on suspicion as they were with Tarlekar when the shooting happened. They claimed Tarlekar shot himself with a country-made pistol he had procured from a source not known to them.” “However, instead of reporting the matter to the police, the two men left the place and dumped the firearm in a well at Yevalewadi. On Tuesday, we recovered the firearm and it is being sent to ballistic experts for an analysis,” he said. Patil said, “The two men are justifying their act by citing fear of police action and they haven’t been able to explain their conduct properly. However, the victim’s wife lodged a complaint suspecting the involvement of the two men in her husband’s death.” The police produced the two men before a local court which ordered their custodial remand till October 17. For almost a day, Tarlekar’s body remained unnoticed in his flat. Investigating officer and inspector (crime) Jagannath Jankar told TOI, “It is possible that in a restricted environment like a flat, the noise of a bullet shot from is not heard by neighbours. In this instance, there were two immediate neighbours and both told the police they did not hear any noise.” Jankar said, “The motive behind the incident is not clear yet. Nothing was stolen from the flat. The conduct of the two men is suspicious and we feel they are not sharing vital details required for putting together the chain of events.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-men-arrested-on-charge-of-murdering-their-techie-friend/articleshow/87030068.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Up in smoke! farm fire share in PM2.5 nears 10%||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality deteriorated marginally on Thursday and touched the higher-end of the ‘moderate’ category. AQI of the capital was 182 and it may reach ‘poor’ category on Friday. About 10% contribution in PM2.5 over Delhi from biomass burning was predicted on Thursday. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, which comes under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said that winds were favourable for transport of smoke from biomass burning. It said crop residue burning fire points observed on Wednesday over Haryana and Punjab were 91 and 132, respectively. Track the pollution level in your cityVK Soni, head, environment and research centre, IMD, said: “Due to north-westerly winds, the pollutants released from stubble burning are being transported to Delhi. Calm wind is being recorded during night hours causing accumulation of pollutants. Delhi’s air quality may remain in the higher end of ‘moderate’ category or may slip to ‘poor’ category on Friday.” He added the air quality of the capital was expected to improve from the evening of October 16 due to easterly wind and rain activity. IMD has predicted very light rain during the evening of October 16 and light to moderate rain on October 17. Light showers are likely on October 18. LS Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Over 200 farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana combined on Wednesday. The weather forecast indicates that the winds will be predominantly coming from the northwest direction of Delhi on October 14 and 15, which would favour the movement of smoke in the downwind. However, rain expected over the weekend in Delhi-NCR would help in clearing the particulates and improving the air quality in the capital.” System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR)’s founder project director Gufran Beig said, “The impact of stubble burning is still marginal as local winds are high and lead pollutant is still PM10 indicating contribution of local dust and nearby biomass burning only. The impact of north India’s stubble burning will soon increase if fire counts continue to increase by the same speed, which are less than last year so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/up-in-smoke-farm-fire-share-in-pm2-5-nears-10/articleshow/87028046.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Delhi||Air panel may consider some new measures under GRAP||New Delhi: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and the adjoining areas is considering a modification in certain measures under the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ categories of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to fight air pollution in the winter months. An official said the commission would take a couple of days to review some of the measures enforceable for the ‘poor’ to ‘severe’ pollution days.Following an order of the Supreme Court in 2016 regarding air quality in Delhi, GRAP was prepared for implementation under different Air Quality Index (AQI) categories, namely moderate, poor, very poor, severe and severe plus or emergency levels of pollution. Last year, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), which was dissolved after the formation of the CAQM, implemented some measures under the ‘very poor’ to the ‘severe’ category of GRAP from October 15 onwards even before the air quality deteriorated to that level.A CAQM official who wished not to be identified stated, “GRAP already exists and to implement its recommendations, a sub-committee has been formed. However, whether an unchanged GRAP will be in operation this winter is still under consideration.”The GRAP sub-committee submitted its observations on October 12. An official said the Union environment ministry and CAQM are reviewing the measures that could be implemented this year. A meeting which was scheduled to take place on Thursday could not be held and a decision will now be taken in two-three days, said an official.The usual GRAP measures under the ‘very poor’ category include a ban on diesel generator sets and a stoppage to the use of coal or firewood in hotels and open eateries. The ‘severe plus’ or emergency measures include a ban on construction activities, prohibiting entry of trucks into Delhi except those carrying essential commodities, introduction of odd-even road use by private vehicles and closure of schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-panel-may-consider-some-new-measures-under-grap/articleshow/87028036.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Currently, every person aged 18 years and above is eligible for vaccination that is being carried out across the country, while the trials on vaccines for beneficiaries aged 12-18 year, 6- 12 years and 2-6 years have been completed. “We are waiting for the government guidelines on the vaccination process but the basic survey shows that there are 16 lakh children who are eligible for vaccination across the Nashik district. The number could be more as this is a rough estimate,” said Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and nodal officer for vaccination in the district. Nashik district has a total population of 71.43 lakh. Of them, 52.49 lakh people are aged 18 years or more. Another senior officer from the health department said the total population for the new vaccination age group was 16.35 lakh. About the vaccination and arrangements, the authorities said primarily, children above the age of 12 years were likely to get the vaccination shots first. “This is the initial plan that is being discussed, though it is yet to be finalised. The vaccination centres will be distinctly located to ensure there is no mix-up of the vaccines,” the officer said. The officer also said once the pilot vaccination centres start, vaccines are likely to be given at the schools, which will cut down on any chance of mixing up the vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-16-lakh-eligible-for-vax-in-2-18-yr-age-group/articleshow/87026729.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Lucknow||Adopt Miyawaki method to reduce carbon footprint, Uttar Pradesh govt tells industries||LUCKNOW: Bringing a major policy change to curb the carbon footprint in the country’s most populated state and to offset the industrial carbon emissions, Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday issued an order making it compulsory for industries to adopt Japanese Miyawaki afforestation technique. Under the technique, the state pollution control board (UPPCB) has recommended industries to grow high density micro forests in a minimum 150 sq meter of land to meet the mandatory requirement of 33% of area of the total land owned by an industry.  The order signed by additional chief secretary, forest, Manoj Singh read, “Standard operating procedure (SOP) has been developed by UPPCB for Miyawaki afforestation technique.  To control air pollution caused by industries, Miyawaki method of plantation is very effective, as these plantations have about 10 times more capacity to absorb air pollutants. Therefore, to develop green belt it’s compulsory for industrial units to adopt the Japanese technique. Technical guidance will be provided by divisional forest officers who will closely monitor the Miyawaki method-based plantation.” “If industrial units fail to comply with the order, appropriate action including revoking license to operate will be taken,” read the order copy. In Miyakawi forests only native species, which are originally found in the forest land in that area are grown in a specially prepared forest lawn soil having organic matter, water retention and percolation along with culture of microorganisms. Such forests have more than 99% of survival and need minimum maintenance. The forest grown by this methodology grows 10 times faster, they are 30 times denser, 100 percent bio diverse and natural. In the last one year, the UP government has covered over 19 hectare of land with micro forest in Lucknow’s Kukrail, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Ghaziabad. Talking to TOI, Ashish Tiwari, secretary of environment and forest climate change said, “This technique is a vital solution for offsetting carbon emissions in the highly populated landscape like UP where land availability for growing forest is limited. Miyawaki forest can be grown in a minimum 150 sq meter of area to meet the mandatory requirement of 33% of area of the total land owned by an industry. Such efforts would offset the carbon footprint.” It costs around Rs 30,000 to develop Miyawaki forest in 150 sq meters of area. The UPPCB is now focusing on bringing educational institutes and residential areas to voluntarily adopt the Japanese plantation method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/adopt-miyawaki-method-to-reduce-carbon-footprint-up-tells-industries/articleshow/87031580.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The two men were arrested on Wednesday night after the police patil accepted a bribe of Rs 70,000 on behalf of the accused officer. The API has been identified as Ganesh Munde, who was posted with Yermala police station, while the police patil has been identified as Sushan Jadhvar. Superintendent of police (ACB) Rahul Khade said an unidentified person had sent an anonymous letter to the police station while levelling personal allegations against a 25-year-old. Based on this, API Mundhe allegedly started summoning the youth to the police station and harassed him Later, the officer allegedly sought Rs 1 lakh from him to close the complaint. The village police patil too intervened in the matter. ACB authorities said the youth was perturbed over the alleged harassment and also with the insistence of the police patil to pay a bribe to the accused officer. He reached out to the ACB and lodged a complaint. During the verification, the demand for a bribe was confirmed and accordingly a trap was laid on late Wednesday night.  “What the officer did in this case, clearly appears to be a violation of the given SOP in the handling of anonymous complaints.

---||Chandigarh||Kejriwal befooling industrialists with false claims: Channi||Chandigarh: Accusing AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for making “false promises” to industrialists in the run-up to assembly elections in Punjab, CM Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday said the former was “befooling them with tall claims based on blatant lies”. Channi said Kejriwal has promised 24x7 electricity supply in the state if his party is voted to power in the assembly polls. Probably Kejriwal is unaware that Punjab government is already giving electricity supply around the clock except for maintenance and unforeseen situations, he said. Countering the AAP leader’s claim to put an end to inspector raj, the CM said his government has already abolished it in the state. As many as 17,589 joint inspections were conducted in the last four and half years through the central inspection system. Steps, like computerised random selection of establishment and officer for inspection with prior notice to industry, joint inspection of department of labour, boilers, legal, metrology and Punjab Pollution Control Board, online uploading of inspection report within 48 hours and risk-based inspections of industrial units have been initiated to facilitate the industry, he said. Regarding VAT refund within 3-6 months, Channi said VAT refunds of nearly Rs 1,700 crore have already been released to the industrialists in the state during last three years and only Rs 70 crore is pending as on this September end. He said the number of mobile wings have been reduced from 14 to 7, and are now being manned by the best and efficient officers of the excise department. To Kejriwal’s another illusory promise to resolve all problems related to infrastructure within 1-2 years, the CM said his government has always laid special emphasis on maintenance and upgradation works in industrial focal points. He said PSIEC has spent nearly Rs 95 crore during the past four and half years to provide concrete roads, revival of water supply line, street lights, sewerage disposal etc to ensure congenial atmosphere for the promotion of industry in the state. Apart from this, approximately Rs 108 crore has also been spent for the development of new focal points i.e. Hi Tech Cycle Valley, Dhanansu, Ludhiana and Nabha. Channi said no maintenance charges have been imposed on plot holders. He said the state government through PSIEC has developed 45 industrial focal points in the state and allotted plots of varying sizes to entrepreneurs for their projects. Referring to the AAP leader’s claim for abolition of ‘hafta system/gunda tax’ if voted to power in state, he said no such system exists in Punjab. Channi said his government has already taken initiatives to prevent cartelisation by abolishing truck unions, which has been commended by the industry. Terming Kejriwal as an opportunist, Channi said such ill-conceived and politically motivated moves would not help him capture electoral ground in Punjab as he is not even remotely concerned with the development of the state and welfare of its people, as he was an outsider and solely eyeing the vote bank of one or another section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kejriwal-befooling-industrialists-with-false-claims-channi/articleshow/87031561.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

PWD elaborated that it would focus on three areas — green cover, dust control and pothole repairs.All government agencies involved with construction, among them the municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, Cantonment Board, Delhi Development Authority, CPWD and PWD, have been asked to submit plans to procure dust suppression chemicals, ensure mechanical road sweeping and ready disposal systems to manage dust vacuumed from the roads.Confirming that the agency has submitted such a plan to Delhi government, a PWD official said, “We will make sure the central verge of PWD roads has a green cover of shrubs. Each PWD construction site measuring over 20,000 sq feet will have an anti-smog gun to settle dust and other air pollutants. Road patching and pothole repairs are also an important part of the pollution control plan because bad roads slow vehicles and increase emissions.” A PWD order says, “As decided in its meeting on October 5, PWD officials have been directed by their higher authorities to inspect construction and demolition sites and open burning, and take necessary action against violators of NGT guidelines and send the report to nodal officer, air pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-focus-areas-for-pwd-in-green-fight/articleshow/87028020.cms||Zumbish

---||Delhi||Allow Chhath Puja, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal writes to lieutenant governor||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has written to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking permission to hold Chhath Puja in the city because the Covid-19 situation is under control and other states have also allowed it. Arguing that the celebrations could take place while following Covid-19 norms, the CM requested the LG to convene a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to grant the said permission. TimesViewThe initial decision was sensible. Any rethink on the issue should be driven only by public health considerations, and not by the competitive politics that has emerged around the festival.DDMA, which is chaired by Baijal and has the CM as a member, had on September 30 banned Chhath Puja in public places fearing a spike in Covid-19 cases. The move triggered protests, spearheaded mainly by BJP MP Manoj Tiwari. “The people of Delhi perform Chhath Puja every year with great faith and reverence. This festival is an important part of our Vedic Aryan culture. People seek health, prosperity and peace by worshiping the sun and Chhathi Maiyya. The Covid-19 situation has been under control for the last three months. I’m of the opinion that we should be allowed to celebrate Chhath Puja while keeping in mind Covid-19 protocols,” chief minister Kejriwal wrote to the lieutenant governor. Taking to Twitter, Kejriwal said, “I have urged Hon’ble LG to allow Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi. Corona is now in control and many other states have allowed it.” “Neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan have allowed Chhath Puja with appropriate restrictions for the safety of residents. I request you to convene a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority at the earliest and grant permission to organise Chhath Puja,” Kejriwal stated in the letter. Earlier, Kejriwal had justified the ban. Later, deputy CM Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya urging him to allow Chhath Puja and issue necessary guidelines, while AAP minister Gopal Rai exhorted the Centre to provide clarity on the subject. DDMA is likely to soon convene a meeting to take a final decision on Chhath Puja and strict SOPs would be developed for facilitating the celebrations.

Ahmednagar, Satara, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Solapur and Pune recorded the maximum drop in the new Covid cases per million population in the state during the latest week in comparison to the September 29-October 5 week. Nine districts — Nanded, Bhandara, Hingoli, Gondia, Mumbai, Palghar, Akola, Latur and Jalna — recorded a rise in Covid cases per million residents, the data showed. In Maharashtra, there have been 132 new cases per million in the latest week, down from 151 cases per million of last week. In Pune, new infections fell from 342 new infections per million residents (last week) to 305 in the latest week. Ahmednagar, which added almost 15% to Maharashtra’s new Covid cases in the past seven days, showed the biggest drop in new infections per million population — from 689 cases last week to 509. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “Calculating the number of cases per million makes it possible to compare cities with vastly different population sizes. If Pune shows a drop in new infections by a certain number per million population, a district like Gadchiroli can also show an equal drop per million residents. However, the fall in Gadchiroli would be considered more significant as its population size is smaller than Pune’s. Hence, the need for calculating the number of cases per million.” He said since the second wave of the pandemic was ebbing, the maximum districts in Maharashtra were showing a drop in new cases per million population. “The state on an average registered 2,400 new cases per day in the last one week. This is also reflected by the drop in the daily Covid cases in most districts. Since the second wave has not completely come down, some districts are showing a rise in new infections on the week-on-week basis. Stress is being laid on increased Covid surveillance in such districts,” Dr Awate added. State Covid-19 Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi said though some districts had recorded a larger drop in new cases per million on a week-on-week basis, one of the reasons for the steeper fall in new infections there might be the high absolute (Covid) numbers. He said. “As per this data, the districts of concern, such as Ahmednagar, are showing a downward trend in new cases per million population. Newer districts, such as Mumbai, seem to be emerging which are showing a slight increase.” Dr Joshi said the data also had to be considered in the light of test positivity rates (TPR) of the respective districts as well as the active cases. “Mumbai’s TPR is hovering between 1.3% and 1.5% , depending on the number of tests done daily. Overall, Mumbai cases have seen only a marginal increase in the latest week, despite the city opening up. That said, the city cannot let its guard down with Diwali coming up and religious places and multiplexes reopening. The slight rise in cases per million is only a signal. It goes on to show that districts that have seen a rise need to be very careful and continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. Dr Joshi said the overall per million population Covid data showed that the second wave has declined in maximum districts in Maharashtra, except for endemic districts such as Mumbai. “The state is showing the lowest number of active and daily reported Covid cases in the recent weeks, with TPR being on the decline constantly.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, told TOI, “In case of districts that have seen a rise in new infections, it is important to identify the clusters that are showing a rise and also take measures such as increased contact tracing and ring fencing for such locations. Such dynamic measures will have to be continued for now. More vigilance should be exercised towards the fag end of any wave of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-among-21-dists-in-state-showing-drop-in-cases/mn-population/articleshow/87030114.cms||Neha Madaan

The move came after municipal council chief officer Shreeya Deochakke found out that the people working in shops, farms or other construction sites do not get time for vaccination and, hence, launched this campaign. “We carry out vaccination at all such sites after 6 pm through the mobile vaccination centres,” said Deochakke. So far, 2,158 people have been vaccinated and over 300 beneficiaries are jabbed daily. “Besides on-the-spot registration, we also offer the choice of vaccine (Covaxin or Covishield). People find it easier to get jabbed at the mobile vaccination centres without having to waste their time,” the officer added. The administration has also taken action against establishments not following the Covid norms and has issued notices to 63 of them. Two teams have been formed to visit and identify the establishments flouting the Covid norms. Every establishment needs to have a partition to ensure a safe distance between the shopkeepers and the customers. Sanitisers and thermal guns for checking the temperature are also mandatory. Moreover, the employees and managerial staff either need to be fully vaccinated or carry a valid RAT negative report. “We are ensuring vaccination of the employees of such establishments. the list of people is updated daily in the evening and they are vaccinated the next day,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mobile-vax-drive-helps-cover-2158-beneficiaries-in-niphad/articleshow/87026742.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Meerut||Man dies after Chinese manja slits his throat||Meerut: A 42-year-old driving home on a scooty died after his throat got slit with a glass-coated Chinese kite string (manja) here on Thursday evening. This is the second such death due to the banned manja in Meerut in the past 20 days. According to witnesses, the man suddenly got entangled in a manja while crossing Jawahar Nagar locality. The sharp thread slashed his throat. He fell off his scooty and lay bleeding on the road, writhing in pain till he was picked up by police, 15 minutes later. He was taken to hospital, where he died. Identifying the deceased as Nirmal, a resident of Saraswati Vihar Colony of TP Nagar police station, SHO, Kankerkhera police station SK Saxena confirmed that the banned Chinese manja slit his throat and he fell on the road. Saxena said an FIR has been filed against unknown person under IPC section 304 A (causing death by negligence). This is the second death due to the banned Chinese manja in Meerut within 20 days. On September 23, Ajay, a resident of Rasulpur of Khatauli, Muzaffarnagar, died after being hit by a Chinese manja on Roorkee Road in Modipuram area, in Meerut district. Residents blamed the casual approach of the government in checking the sale and purchase of this deadly manja. In 2017, the National Green Tribunal had ordered a total ban on manufacture, sale and purchase of the manja, which is generally made of nylon and other synthetic material and is coated with glass powder that makes it deadly. This is so sad that someone meets such a tragic death which can be totally averted if we strictly check the production, sale and purchase of this thread,” said SC Chandra from Balwant Nagar. The police, however, said there has been a clampdown on synthetic manja but every now and then, buyers and sellers manage to skip the radar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-dies-after-chinese-manja-slits-his-throat/articleshow/87028047.cms||---

For the second time within the past 10 days, Rabia was seen inaugurating development projects initiated by her father in the Amritsar (East) assembly constituency. She inaugurated the Rs 33-lakh development work of parks, which former Amritsar Improvement Trust chairman Dinesh Bassi had inaugurated earlier, in the assembly constituency on Thursday. Although Rabia denied joining politics, she said that the stalled development projects in the constituency will not only be resumed but also completed. “Papa is fighting a big battle and I feel he will continue to fight,” she said. “Do you need leaders who don’t get emotional for Punjab. He gets impassioned as he feels the pain of Punjab and why he shouldn’t feel so, he is too much attached with Punjab” she added. Stating that she had come to inaugurate the stalled development work of parks on behalf of her father, she said she knew the development work had already been inaugurated but at the same time she said the development was halted which would resume now. Earlier on October 5, Rabia had inaugurated the development work of a road. Senior Congress leader Raman Bakshi said it is a common practice among the children of elected leaders to nurture their parent’s constituency. “There is no harm even if she decides to contest the election to continue her family’s legacy,” he said. Sources said Sidhu and his wife and former MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu were yet to clarify their stand on elections but there are indications that Rabia may be launched in politics as she has suddenly started moving around in the constituency .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/papas-fighting-a-big-fight-sidhus-daughter/articleshow/87031568.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Did you not know the story that you have written in the letter today while putting a ban on Chhath Puja, Mr. Chief Minister? Better late than never… let’s celebrate Chhath together,” Tiwari stated in a tweet, adding that Chhath will be celebrated in a disciplined manner by following all Covid-19 norms.The BJP MP has been demanding permission for Chhath Puja in the capital since September 30 when Delhi Disaster Management Authority banned the celebrations in public places. The CM had initially justified the ban.Tiwari said it was a blunder by the government to ban Chhath Puja. “I kept appealing to the government to remove the ban because when markets, public transport and even swimming pools are open then what was the logic of banning Chhath Puja. The AAP government played politics over Chhath Puja, which is unfair. Every religion should be respected but the AAP government hurt the sentiments of the Hindus. Kejriwal wrote a letter to the LG when protests against AAP government intensified,” he claimed.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said it was a victory of BJP workers and all those having faith in Chhath Puja. “CM Kejriwal had to finally change his mind due to protest and pressure by our party workers and people of the Purvanchal community,” claimed Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tiwari-claims-victory-takes-a-dig-at-kejriwal/articleshow/87028078.cms||---

The generated gas will then be supplied to nearby houses and commercial establishments. In the budget speech for 2021-22, the state government had announced that it would provide financial assistance to promote biogas generation on cattle, pig and poultry farms. The state government has notified the scheme to set up biogas plants and a senior officer said that farmer owners will be extended support to not only manage their waste, but to also tap into the renewable energy source that will help save on energy consumption. Besides, the bio-slurry by-product can be used as a liquid fertiliser, the officer said. The gas will be supplied to beneficiaries in the morning and evening for a fixed time period at Rs 400 per month for domestic use and Rs 1,000 per month for commercial purposes. This will lead to savings for consumers in LPG consumption. The scheme will be implemented through the department of new and renewable energy (DNRE) and Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) will be responsible for supplying the generated gas to consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biogas-plants-on-cattle-pig-poultry-farms-get-boost/articleshow/87031566.cms||---

While some in the Calangute-Baga area have already started operations, beach shacks, which are mostly dependent on charter tourists, are yet to open in Candolim. “A few that are ready will start this weekend,” James Fernandes, a shack owner in Candolim, said. “Others will start by the end of this month. But there are some owners who have decided not to start their shacks because it’s not certain how many charter tourists will arrive.” While the central government has given the green signal for charters, it is not yet clear when they will start coming in, shack owners said. “We’ve been told that there will be foreign tourists by November-end, but we’ll have to wait and see,” Gino Lopes, a shack owner in Candolim, said. Fernandes said the shacks that are opening are located at Calangute and Baga and are close to approach roads to the beach. “It does not make sense to set up shacks in areas where there is no approach road because domestic tourists do not want to walk too much to shacks that are located away from the roads. “Also, most of the domestic tourists don’t spend too much and though it looks like there are many tourists, they actually don’t patronise beach shacks,” he said. “It costs Rs 4 lakh to set up a shack, so there are some who are not going to erect their shacks because they don’t know if they’ll recover their money.” President of the Traditional Shacks Owners’ Association, Manuel Cardozo, who has a shack at Calangute and is largely dependent on charter tourists, said he started erecting his shack on Thursday. “Hopefully, there will be some good news about charters by next month,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shack-owners-sceptical-about-charter-arrivals/articleshow/87031571.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Adviser asks MC to give C&D waste policy report on Oct 18||CHANDIGARH: UT adviser Dharam Pal has asked the municipal corporation to give a detailed report and presentation on the construction and demolition (C&D) waste policy on October 18. The directions were issued after the MC recently finalised a draft policy that recommends fining transporters and generators for violating Construction and Demolition (C&D) Waste Rules. Penalty of Rs 5,500 per vehicle dumping unprocessed C&D waste in low-lying sites, landfills or public places has been recommended. The draft policy—recently submitted by the municipal corporation to the UT administration—says penalty should be increased by 10% annually every April 1. It reads, “The authority to issue challan will rest with the sub-divisional engineer or junior engineer of the road wing or enforcement inspectors of the MC…The generator/ producer who are going to re-construct their houses should be levied the C&D waste processing costs at Rs 170 per square metre per storey and Rs 20 per square metre for new constructions at the time of approval of the building plan from the UT estate office or municipal corporation building branch. The rates shall be increased by 10% annually on base rate from April 1 every year.” The policy says any question relating to its interpretation will be referred to the MC commissioner, whose decision will be final and binding and no appeal in any court of law is maintainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/give-cd-waste-policy-report-on-oct-18-adviser-asks-mc/articleshow/87030115.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Both the temples received Rs 1.49 crore in cash, besides gold, silver and foreign currency, said Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board chief executive officer Y S Gupta. The board did not share the number of devotees who visited this year. In 2020, Rs 1.31 crore were received in donation; in 2019, Rs 1.28 crore were received from 3.41-lakh devotees; and in 2018, as many as 3.35-lakh devotees donated Rs 1.23 crore. Besides, 78 nuggets of gold weighing 87.61 gram and 976 silver items weighing 7091.65 gram were also received. The donated foreign currency included 101 US dollars and 5 Canadian dollars. On the last day of Ashwin Navaratra, Mata Mansa Devi Temple received Rs 12.84 lakh and Kali Mata Temple Rs 3.73 lakh in donation. Devotees bought prashad online, which was introduced last year amid the pandemic.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No free Covid vaccination drive today on account of Dussehra||MUMBAI: Due to the Navratri festival, the city recorded one of its lowest vaccination turnouts in months on Thursday when only 46,540 people turned up for the Covid vaccine shot. The BMC has decided to not hold the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Friday on account of Dussehra. “Judging from the Ashtami and Navami turnout, people may not want to take the vaccine on Dussehra as well,” said a BMC official. On Ashtami on Wednesday, the turnout was a bit higher at 55,320. “The festival has affected the turnout as people fast on such days and are reluctant to take the vaccine,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We expect the vaccination drive to pick up pace from Saturday,” he added. On Thursday, while public centres vaccinated 35,598 people, private centres only managed to vaccinate 8,907. The turnout was over one lakh on three days this month—1.5 lakh on October1,1.05 lakh on October 2 and 1.09 lakh on October 6. A BMC official said the corporation has around three lakh vaccine doses in stock. The city has vaccinated more than 95% of its adult population and over 54% are fully vaccinated. However, as last-mile connectivity could be an issue, the BMC public health department has come up with a new plan to increase vaccination. “In a bid to reach out to more people, the BMC has decided to carry out mobile vaccination facilities, which will visit neighbourhoods where vaccination numbers are low,” said a BMC doctor. The community drive is scheduled to begin next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-free-vax-drive-today-on-account-of-dussehra/articleshow/87031624.cms||---

Popular pandals made a comeback this year and celebrations have been a mix of caution and festivities. The festival, symbolising victory of good over evil, is being celebrated this year with all the regular elements: durga puja, dandiya and garba events at apartment complexes, community halls, temples and public spaces. “We are relieved that we can go out and take part in the festivities this year, including garba and dandiya events,” said K Surekha, a resident of Somajiguda. While Sahastra Kumari, a resident of Ram Nagar, added, “Dasara signifies controlling the 10 directions of life such as desire, anger, greed among other things that can destroy a person’s life. Gaining victory in these directions is the main significance of the festival and we are going to celebrate that spirit this year.” “We have been taking part in the nine-day celebrations organised at the community hall in our colony every year. It has been a tradition to organise dandiya programmes after the puja every year. The festivities on the day of Dasara have always been special and we are looking forward to it this year,” Sahastra added. Apart from the Telugus in Hyderabad, people from other communities such as Bengalis, Gujaratis and Marwaris, who have made the city their home, are also all geared up for the auspicious Durga Puja with pomp and show on the last day of Navratri. Both the Marwari and Gujarai communities celebrate the festival in a similar fashion, except for a few specific traditions of their own. “One Marwari tradition is that for nine days we keep wheat in a new pot in a corner and add water daily. Then we use the wheat leaves for puja,” said Bhavna Jain, a resident of Sindhi colony. While Gujaratis are known for garba during Navratri, they begin the daily celebrations with a dance around a garbi at home first. For Bengalis, Dasara is the most special time of the year. There are quite a number of ‘pujo pandals’ that have become the centre of celebrations in the city over the years. On Dasara, the final aarti is offered to the goddess. The women, a spectacular sight in red and white, go up to the idols and feed them sweets, before bidding adieu to the goddess. Temples decked for final festivities Temples across the city are being decked up with flowers and lights to welcome devotees on festival day. Ram Shankar, a priest from the city, hoped that similar to the spirit of Dasara, good would triumph over evil in people’s lives too. “This is the day when Lord Ram killed Raavana. Raavana had 36 crore gods and goddesses under him, yet his deeds were not good, and that was the reason he died in such a way. I urge all to pray for a healthy and happy life so that they can live in peace and harmony, build brotherhood among each other irrespective of religion, and work for humanity according to their religion,” Shankar said. The Ujjaini Mahankali temple, which attracts a significant number of devotees every year during Dasara, is all set with special security arrangements and additional queues for the big day. Stage set for ‘Raavan Dahan’ Arrangements are also being made for the traditional burning of Raavana’s effigy at Exhibition Grounds at Nampally, Ram temple at Langar Houz, Amberpet and other places. Rajasthani Pragathi Samaj secretary Govind Rathi, who organises ‘Raavan Dahan’ at Nampally Exhibition grounds every year, said, “This year the effigy will be 20-feet tall. We are going to have a spectacular show of ‘Raavan Dahan’ this year with colourful display of fireworks for about an hour followed by cultural events.” The Samaj and Exhibition Society Dussehra Sammelan Samithi also organised nine-day 49th Ramayan Mela-2021 at the Exhibition Grounds. The Samithi, however, could not organise garba and dandiya this year to prevent crowding. Instead, they held a ‘Kavi Sammelan’ with a limited gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dasara-celebrations-set-to-rock-city-festivities-at-fever-pitch/articleshow/87028691.cms||---

Instead of Rs 1,232 crore, only Rs 28 crore is present in the corporation’s GPF accounts, Bharadwaj said during a presser and asked BJP functionaries to answer where the remaining Rs 1,200 crore went.“Not a single penny has been deposited into GPF accounts since 2014 by north corporation and it hasn’t paid GPF payouts to several retired employees. Everyone knows that BJP is packing their bags because they will be kicked out of the corporations, but they should have the decency to tell the next dispensation as to how that money will be brought back,” Bharadwaj stated.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Kapoor said salaries, pensions and other expenses of corporations had increased multi-fold, but the corporations were getting funds from the AAP government as per the 2015 demand. “The economic crunch and pressure to meet enhanced expenses on salary, pension and other bills has forced the corporation to withdraw from reserves with AAP government being responsible for this situation,” Kapoor added.

According to the company’s first ‘Transparency Report’, 10 per cent of these accounts were locked by its legal team while the rest were closed at the request of the customers. Elaborating on the 10% of cases that required intervention by its legal team, the report said these 1,447 accounts were locked due to payment disputes or ongoing investigations in cases by law enforcement agencies (LEA). WazirX said that during April 2021 to September 2021, it got 377 requests from LEAs out of which 38 requests were from foreign law enforcement agencies. “All the legal information requests received are criminal in nature such as fraud, kidnapping and narcotics-related queries & our compliance rate has been 100% for over 377 requests,” the report said. WazirX has 8.5 million users with overall trading volumes of $30 billion since January 2021. As per its data, 2.72% of its user base was added during the April - September 2021 period.

Sachin Dixit, a resident of Khodiyarnagar, who is accused in the case, was brought to the city on Thursday. Dixit was arrested by the Gandhinagar police five days ago after he admitted having killed his live-in partner Heena alias Mehendi Pethani. “We will question him about his motive behind the murder. Was it just due to pressure from Heena to live with her forever or he had some other reason too. Also, he has claimed that he killed Heena after she slapped him but it is possible that Dixit may have planned to bump her off,” said a police official. The police said that Dixit has been sent for medical tests and he will be produced before a local court on Friday. The cops will also investigate the background of Dixit and Pethani, and if the couple had stayed in any other city before Vadodara. The murder of Pethani came to light after Dixit abandoned his one-year-old child at a gaushala in Gandhinagar last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/possible-that-dixit-planned-live-in-partners-murder-cops/articleshow/87027886.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi University’s off-campus colleges getting out of bounds too||NEW DELHI: With undergraduate admissions in Delhi University has seen a rush from the first cut off list itself, even off campus colleges have rapidly filled up the seats. In fact, several colleges have admitted more students than the seats available, with political science (H), philosophy (H) and BA (Programme) proving big attractions. Aryabhatta College, which had pegged its cutoff for political science (H) at 96% in the first list had all its seats taken in the reserved category even before the second list was announced. Principal Manoj Sinha said that the course saw almost three times the sanctioned strength. “It is unusual that we had all seats taken under the first list itself. We have risen as a college and students have begun to value us as an institution and the gaps between the most-sought-after colleges and others are narrowing,” said Sinha. “These days, students make realistic judgements on faculty and dispensation in a particular college.” Sinha added, “In political science (H), we have four students who have 100%. There are many with 98% and 99% as well. These students had other options, but they chose to take admission in our college.” Similarly, at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, admission for economics (H), which had a high asking mark of 98.75% under the second list, is unlikely to remain open for the third list. Gyantosh Jha, principal of ARSD College, attributed the rush in admissions to the NIRF rankings of colleges, which have given many unheralded good ranks. Said Jha, “Since the rankings bean, the scenario has begun changing. The perceptions about off-campus colleges are changing among the aspirants. In ARSD, we have often had migration requests with students wanting to join us from the second year. In our college, economics (H) and BA (Programme) will close after the second list for most student categories.” In several colleges, admissions in the reserved categories also closed after the first list itself, something that several principals felt was unusual. Following the release of the second cutoff list, Suman Sharma, principal of Lady Shri Ram College for Women, had said, “This is the first time that several reserved category admissions have closed after the first list. Usually admissions for such categories continue till the last few cutoff lists.” ARSD’s Jha added, “For several courses this year, the seats in the reserved categories were fully filled while unreserved categories remained open. This is surprising because the difference in the cutoff marks between the categories wasn’t too big.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dus-off-campus-colleges-getting-out-of-bounds-too/articleshow/87030162.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Four days after elections were held on October 10, Prakash Raj, who lost as president to Manchu Vishnu, wrote a letter to the election officer on Thursday asking for the CCTV footage. “Numerous Supreme Court judgments also mandated polling officers to preserve the records.

Tempers were high and we saw unruly and anti-social behaviour of disciplinary and reconciliation committee member Mohan Babu and ex-president Naresh. .” Prakash Raj went on to say: “You used your discretionary powers to allow them and their henchmen in the polling arena.

Fadnavis, the party’s election in-charge for Goa, said that if someone wishes to see the real face of Trinamool Congress, they should visit West Bengal, where there is “no democracy”. Addressing karyakartas at Taleigao, Fadnavis said that the upcoming Goa election is a different one, and that parties are fighting to become the main opposition party in the state. He said it is “our responsibility” to win and pay tribute to Parrikar. The former Maharashtra CM said that Delhi is not a full-fledged state, and that police and PWD are looked after by the Union government. He said that only two things are with the AAP government — education and health. “They get a lot of money as it is the capital city, and they go around the country saying that they want to implement the Delhi model,” he said. Slamming TMC, Fadnavis said that whatever is seen in Goa is from that party’s publicity department. He alleged that in West Bengal, “if you speak about democracy, you will be assaulted, and if you demand your rights, you will be hanged”. “Some people want to get such a government in Goa, (but) the people of the state will not allow it,” he said. “This isn’t the culture of Goa and we should not allow such a culture in Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-winning-polls-will-be-tribute-to-parrikar/articleshow/87031605.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||We are on verge of collapse: Private bus operators of Punjab||CHANDIGARH: Private bus transporters of Punjab on Thursday claimed that they were on the verge of collapse due to losses suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic and the government’s anti-transporters policies. In a press conference held in Chandigarh Press Club, the Punjab Motor Union members said if necessary steps are not taken immediately, this important sector will vanish from the business scene without a trace. Passenger transport sector in Punjab is one of the prominent revenue generating sectors and employs more than 1.25 lakh personnel, they said. Union secretary Rajinder Singh Bajwa said the Punjab government had promised that tax on buses will be waived off till March 31, 2022, but nothing has been done so far. Whereas new transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring has directed the department to impound and challan buses which have not paid tax till date. The transporters alleged that here also the ruling Congress government was not impounding the buses of party leaders despite the same being plied without taxes. Buses only of opposition leaders or operators linked to them were being targetted, the alleged. Bajwa said the state government charges tax at the rate of Rs 2.69 per litre of fuel and would not lose much in case of its waiver as it is already earning Rs 2.27 per litre more as value added tax. Bus operators are also demanding complete abolition of social security cess imposed on them and increase in exemption of tax payment in a month from four days to eight days to provide hassle free service and proper maintenance of vehicles every month. They have also demanded extension of amnesty scheme till March 31, 2022. Private transporters are also of the view that certain populist policies of the state government, like free travel to women passengers in government buses, have also hit their business as there is hardly 20% occupancy in buses these days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-verge-of-collapse-say-private-bus-operators-of-punjab/articleshow/87031585.cms||---

It will become part of one of the seven defence companies which will be dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. The PM will also address the employees during the virtual ceremony from DRDO Bhavan in New Delhi. While retaining the name Ordnance Factory Medak, it would be called a unit of Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (AVNL), Chennai. This follows a rejig of all the 41 factories under the Ordnance Factory Board and grouped under seven different companies. Under AVNL, four ordnance factories — Ordnance Factory, Medak, Heavy Vehicle Factory, Avadi, Machine Tool Prototype Factory, Ambarnath and Vehicle Factory, Jabalpur — have been grouped. Nearly 70,000 employees of all ordnance factories across the country had opposed the rejig as they had fears that they would be removed from employment. However, they were assured that they would only be allocated to new companies. “But, a lot is going to change. The companies will now have to operate in a corporate way making their own profits and sustain,” an official said. This would also mean that apart from having to bag orders from the government and other security agencies, they would also have to market their products abroad and sell them. Ordnance Factory, Medak, for instance, has been manufacturing mine-proof and bullet-proof vehicles. The armoured vehicles are being used by the Indian armed forces. The new defence companies would now have to make their own pitches to bag orders based on quality and other factors. After restructuring of the Ordnance Factory Board, seven new defence PSUs — Munition India Limited, Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited, Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, Troops Comforts Limited, Yantra India Limited, India Optel Limited and Gliders India Limited — have been created.

---||Aurangabad||Asst charity commissioners’ petition dismissed by HC||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court has dismissed a petition filed by the assistant charity commissioners (ACCs) of Aurangabad, Beed and Jalna seeking payment at par with the civil judge junior division, citing the `equal pay for equal work’ principle. Among other things, the petitioners — Syed Vilayat Quadari, Paikrao Sanjay Pundalikrao and Panchal Rajpal Dnyanoba — had pointed out that the Gujarat government was already paying salary to their ACCs at par with the judicial officers appointed by them. When the law was same in the two states, the differing salaries in Maharashtra were violative of the Constitutional provisions, they had argued. The HC division bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice Sanjay Mehare ruled on Wednesday, “The nature of duties, functions, powers, responsibilities, recruitment, appointment, control, cadre recognition, service conditions of the civil judge junior division and the assistant charity commissioners, are dissimilar.” The bench observed that the cadre of the petitioners was different and not comparable with that of the civil judge junior division in Maharashtra. The bench, however, said that the petitioners have a right to make their representation before a pay commission, if any, formed by the state for revising the pay scale. The HC relied on a 2004 judgement by the Supreme Court, which held that framing the appropriate rules of service condition of its employee, revising the pay, is in the domain of every state government. Ultimately in the matter of pay and service conditions, the appropriate Government derives its power only in terms of the Rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution. It is for the state, either to accept the Pay Commission’s recommendations constituted by it in furtherance of a valid policy or decline. The bench also said that it found force in the government pleader’s argument that pay revision was the matter of policy decision of the government, and the court should not direct the government to implement a particular pay scale to a particular cadre. The bench cited a 2010 Supreme Court judgement which held that the court should avoid giving a declaration granting a particular scale of pay and compel the Government to implement the same. Lawyer A P Bhandari, representing the petitioners, had submitted among other things that in terms of discharge of functions and duties, the nature of the ACCs powers like judicial officers in the state of Maharashtra, also compared their work and duties with the judicial officers deputed in charity organizations by the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/asst-charity-commissioners-petition-dismissed-by-hc/articleshow/87026773.cms||Mohammed Akhef

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal assured Sohana and other members of his team that they would be given due honour and recognition in the SAD. Sukhbir said Mohali had emerged as a leading city of the north during the last SAD-led government. “We went in for holistic development of Mohali. From an international airport to expressways and bringing world class institutions like International School of Business (ISB) and IT power house Infosys, we laid the foundation for making it a world-class city,” he added. But, the SAD president said, unfortunately the Congress government did not add a single project to Mohali and in fact it could not even ensure maintenance of the city, he alleged. Sukhbir also came down heavily on former health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who he said had done nothing for Mohali but had looted its resources by taking over panchayat land to build commercial trusts. He said Sidhu would be held accountable for all his corrupt practices once the SAD-BSP alliance government was formed in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/former-labourfed-chairman-parvinder-sohana-rejoins-sad/articleshow/87031618.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Why Lakhimpur Kheri should be proud of its ‘Banana Republic’ tag||LUCKNOW: Amid the cloud of recent infamy in the light of the Tikonia incident in which eight people were killed, here comes a silver lining for Lakhmipur Kheri. On Thursday, UP's largest district sent 20 metric tonnes of bananas to Iran. Kheri is one of the largest banana producing districts of the state. Others are Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Allahabad and Kaushambi. The product was directly procured from farmers of Palia Kalan in Lakhimpur and brought to Lucknow where it was packed at a mango packhouse in Malihabad. After a send-off ceremony held there, two 40-foot containers were sent on a trial basis to Iranian market. So far, the bananas produced in UP were sold in domestic market and transported to other states via road. Thursday saw the first ever trial shipment export of the fruit from Lucknow to Iran. The shipment was flagged off from Malihabad to Iran by sea route via Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Navi Mumbai by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) registered exporter. It will take about 15 days for the shipment to reach the market, which is just as much as it takes for the bananas to ripe. It was because of the concerted effort of the APEDA, under the union Ministry of Commerce and Industry that the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri could produce high quality bananas with a long shelf life for export. The total area of banana cultivation is more than 1500 acres in Palia Kalan area of the district. CB Singh, AGM, APEDA said, “We worked at several levels. Farmers were first trained in producing bananas using advanced technology.” The training was provided by M/s Desai Agro Foods, the biggest banana exporter in the country. “It is a cash crop and most families here grow it,” said farmer Gurab Singh, whose family owns around 70acres of land in Palia. In the last few months farmers have received a lot of inputs on growing better quality bananas. It’s the G-9 (Grand Nain) variety that is mainly grown in Lakhimpur Kheri and the same variety was exported to Iran. New markets like USA, Belgium, Russia, Germany, Japan etc. may be explored for lifting more consignments from UP. “State government will facilitate export from other banana exporting districts as well,” said AGM, APEDA. Farmers in Barabanki, Gorakhpur and Varanasi may also be trained in producing export quality fruit. India was not producing export quality bananas before 2005 as the country did not have the technology. Banana is the fifth most traded agricultural product in the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/why-lakhimpur-kheri-should-be-proud-of-its-banana-republic-tag/articleshow/87031611.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Delhi||Delhi high court wants digital facilities for prosecutors to be put on fast track||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has sought a response from Delhi government on a plea seeking to provide adequate digital infrastructure and facilities to prosecutors. A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Bhambhani recently noted that the trial courts and high court’s system is one and if one of them is not working efficiently, the working of the other gets affected and the issue needs to be seen holistically. It issued notice to the state government on an application filed by Delhi Prosecutors Welfare Association in a pending suo motu case concerning digitisation of the directorate of prosecution. The court said “prosecutors are actually employees of Delhi government” and granted time to the government to file a reply to the application. “In the meantime, the principal secretary (home) of Delhi government is directed to consider the representations made by the applicant (prosecutors association) in accordance with the law,” the bench said and listed the matter for November 12. In its plea, the association said that on account of the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, the virtual system of court hearings and filings has become a part of the judicial system. The prerequisite for an efficient virtual court environment is the availability of adequate facilities/infrastructure, which is missing in the case of public prosecutors in Delhi, it added. The bench also directed the principal secretary (law) of the Delhi government to file an affidavit to show what compliance has been made in pursuance to its earlier undertaking given to the court relating to timely filing of appeals/criminal leave petitions by the state. The prosecutors association had earlier said that prosecutors lacked sufficient infrastructure to run their offices during the pandemic that resulted in virtual proceedings and it would be necessary to give them proper equipment to run a digital office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-wants-digital-facilities-for-prosecutors-to-be-put-on-fast-track/articleshow/87028144.cms||---
---||Delhi||Green switch: Tender floated for 330 e-buses in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s transport department has fastened the process of inducting low-floor and air-conditioned electric buses as part of the cluster scheme. After issuing a tender of 190 buses earlier this month, it has now floated another tender for 140 electric buses. On October 1, the department had published a Request for Qualifications and Proposal (RFQP) for induction of 450 low-floor, air-conditioned and CNG-run buses, and a day later, tenders for 190 electric buses were floated. Now, it has come up with a RFQP for 140 electric buses. Delhi government plans to induct 1,000 electric buses under the cluster scheme, apart from the more than 1,000 electric buses being engaged by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). According to the RFQP document, the department has inducted 3,033 buses under the cluster scheme for operation of private stage carriage services in Delhi. The aim of the government in inducting more buses is to provide safe, secure, efficient, and reliable operation of buses in Delhi, it said. The DTC board recently approved the induction of 1,015 electric and 230 CNG-run buses in the financial year 2021-22 at a meeting chaired by transport minister Kailash Gahlot, who is also the DTC chairman. DTC currently has a fleet 3,762 buses, of which 2,644 were procured between 2007 and 2010 and nearing “end of life”. According to the procurement contracts under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the lifespan of these buses is 12 years or 7.5 lakh kms, whichever is later. To tide over the shortage and cater to the public transport needs, DTC had requested the state transport authority to allow its buses to run for 15 years from the date of registration. Apart from these buses, DTC is also engaging 300 electric buses, which will be run and maintained by an operator that will be paid operating cost per kilometre under Operating Expenses (OPEX) model. The operators will maintain the buses and provide drivers, while DTC will depute its conductors and bear the cost of electricity consumption. New bus depots are also being constructed and some existing ones upgraded for parking of electric buses, which includes depots like Rohini-I and II, Mundela Kalan, Burari, Subhash Place, Mayapuri, Rajghat-II, Hari Nagar, Sukhdev Vihar etc. Delhi government plans to eventually replace all CNG-run buses in the public transport fleet with electric ones as part of a shift towards cleaner fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-switch-tender-floated-for-330-e-buses/articleshow/87030206.cms||---

Seven months later, the main accused Santlal Jaiswal with a reward of Rs 50,000 was arrested from Prayagraj, according to UP STF sources. Consignments of liquor cartons used to leave the factory premises twice on the same invoice using the same vehicle, leading to excise tax evasion of Rs 32 lakh per consignment, sources added. After going through the books, it came to light that a tax evasion to the tune of Rs 100 crore a year was going on for some time. The authorities were tightlipped when asked since when this alleged fraud was going on. A similar raid has been conducted at the godowns of the excise department in Unnao. All those godowns are situated on the Kanpur-Lucknow Highway. Company officials, excise department officers, transporters, warehouse managers, local distributors were involved in the alleged scam. Jaiswal, a resident of Jaunpur, had been in the business of liquor distributorship for the past 15 years. He had godowns in Jaunpur. He used to procure the illegal consignments for distribution. Every consignment would fetch him Rs 15 lakh of profit, said an STF source. "On March 3, in all 12 people were detained for questioning and later eight were booked under IPC sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (fraud) and 477 (fraudulent cancellation, destruction of valuable security) apart from relevant sections of the Excise Act," said circle officer STF (Meerut field unit) Brajesh Singh who was part of the team that conducted a raid in Saharanpur in March. "Those arrested in March included transporter Satyavan Sharma, technical head of the company Kamal Daniel and HR head Virender Shankhdhar. However, Jaiswal was at large and recently the Varanasi field unit of UP STF got a tip-off that he was near the railway station in Prayagraj. He was then nabbed," the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/7-months-after-stf-raid-found-tax-evasion-of-rs-100-cr/year-at-distillery-main-accused-held/articleshow/87028209.cms||Sandeep Rai

Following a call from a local farmer, Nenavath Balu, eight volunteers from Animal Warriors Conservation Society (AWCS) went on four motorbikes to save the cow.  “We received the call at 10.30 pm after which we immediately left for the location. We loaded the equipment on our bikes and took off,” said Pradeep Nair of AWCS. The cow was half submerged in the water and shiveringThe volunteers had already asked the farmer to arrange for a tractor or a JCB to pull the animal out using ropes. “The cow was half submerged in the water and shivering. We couldn’t wait till morning because prolonged exposure to cold temperature in the water could cause hypothermia in the animal,” volunteer J Santoshi told TOI. The challenge was when they realised that they did not have enough rope and the tractor wheels got stuck in the slush and not moving forward in the field. The volunteers had already asked the farmer to arrange for a tractor or a JCB to pull the animal out using ropes.The situation got tricky when the animal got stuck almost at the rim of the well due to the uneven stone surface. However, the volunteers pulled it to safety. “The cow was very weak. After we massaged its limbs, it got up and went directly to its one-and-a-half- month old calf in a cattle shed nearby,” said Santoshi. “The cow was very weak. After we massaged its limbs, it got up and went directly to its oneand-a-half- month old calf in a cattle shed nearby,”The rescue team launched an online fundraiser campaign through which it appealed to the people to help provide equipment and a vehicle for their future rescues.

This was alleged by one of the injured workers Bharat Pandavadara (24) in his complaint to the police. Based on Pandavadara’s complaint, police on Thursday booked six persons, including head of the safety department and senior engineers, of the soda ash plant, which is part of Nirma Group, for culpable homicide (not amounting to murder). On Wednesday, two persons — engineer Hiren Agrawat and factory worker Pratap Odedara — were killed and three others injured when an overhead container filled with raw material, fell on them. This was the second industrial accident in the factory in the last two months. Following the incident, the work at the factory was suspended under the orders of the Probandar district collector A M Sharma. The accident took place when work was going on on an iron platform on which the container with raw material was kept. Those booked include factory’s head of safety P Suresh, head of production A K Singh, senior engineer Deepak Yoganandi, senior mechanical engineer Manish Rathod, production engineer Rashid Badi and deceased engineer Hiren Agrawat. According to the police complaint, Pandavadara, Jayesh Joshi, Agrawat and other workers were on duty when the accident occurred. He stated that they had complained to their safety team that the iron platform on which the huge container was placed was vibrating. But the safety team did not check it and told workers to continue work as everything was normal, the complaint added. “Within a few minutes, the container along with the iron platform came crashing down killing Agrawat (29) on the spot and injuring other workers,” Pandavadara stated. One of the injured worker Pratap Odedara (30) succumbed to his injuries in hospital. Joshi and Pandavadara are under treatment in a Porbandar hospital. “Workers had no safety gears despite complaining about poor safety standards at the unit. The accidents occurred due to negligence of the engineers at the unit,” Pandavadara alleged in his complaint. “We have brought Badi and P Suresh for questioning,” in-charge police inspector H P Dhandhaliya of, Kamlabaug police station, told TOI. The accused have been booked under section 304 (whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery) of the Indian Penal Code, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/poor-industrial-safety-standards-resulted-in-accident-that-killed-two-says-fir/articleshow/87028203.cms||---

Thursday was the last day of the vaccination drivewhen an estimated 8,000 doses were administered by 7pm. As many as 1.02 lakh beneficiaries were administered doses, including 61,000 who received the first dose and 41,000 who got second dose. On the first day of the mission, 55,000 doses were administered, however, the daily turnout declined thereafter. In the remaining six days, 47,000 doses were administered. The authorities claimed that there was a decline after the first day, but it is more than the daily turnout before the mission began. Kolhapur district health officer Yogesh Sale said, “We have done away with the prior registration to get the jab. Ample doses were made available with every vaccination centre. The festival affected the turnout to some extent; however the turnout was good due to efforts of our staff.” The urban local bodies joined late in the mission. For instance, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation joined the mission just three days ago. The KMC in order to ensure high turnout opened vaccination centres early morning till late evening. This helped increase the turnout. In KMC areas, around 4,500 beneficiaries turned out for the jab. District collector Rahul Rekhawar had set target of achieving of 95% vaccination in Kolhapur district during the mission period. For first dose, 81% target has been achieved and for second dose, 40% of the first dose beneficiaries have been covered. So far, 24.58 lakh citizens have received first jab out and about 9.97 lakh of them have got the second dose as well and are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/one-lakh-vax-doses-given-during-special-drive/articleshow/87026794.cms||---

In videos that went viral on social media, residents and security personnel of the paper mill could be seen holding the cubs, making them walk and clicking selfies with them. Sources said some residents found the two cubs in the colony in the morning. They picked the cubs, aged about a month, and then set them free on the road. People picked up the cubs, some even manhandled them and took selfies. A security guard moved around with a cub in his hand and clicked pictures with it. After TOI reported the matter to DFO Chandrakant Tambe, he dispatched a team. He claimed that the RFO, Markanda, Raut brought the cubs to the RFO office. Sources said both the cubs are females. One of the cubs is learnt to be weak in hind limbs and could be seen limping. Foresters have warned people not to step out after evening hours as the mother leopard might come in search of its cubs. Forest department had recently captured a male leopard in Paper mill premises. Foresters are not sure whether to reunite both the cubs with their mother or keep the limping one back for treatment. They are also mulling capturing the mother and setting it free in a distant jungle with the cubs after the lame one is recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-manhandle-click-selfies-with-2-leopard-cubs-in-gadchiroli-paper-mill-colony/articleshow/87031636.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Aurangabad||Officials: M’wada has no authorised biodiesel outlet||Aurangabad: In what came as a shock to many transporters, the government officials have revealed that in all the eight districts of Marathwada, there is not even one authorised outlet for the sale of biodiesel. “The biodiesel that is being sold currently is, therefore, unauthorised and might be adulterated. Such fuel can cause damage to the vehicles as well as the environment. Consumers should not fall prey to the price difference. In some cases, there is a difference of around Rs 30 between the biodiesel sold in the unauthorised outlets and diesel,” said Waman Kadam, the deputy divisional commissioner of food and civil supplies. As per the official data, 18 raids have been conducted across Marathwada in the past few weeks to expose the illegal sale of biodiesel. “It has been found that in Marathwada, some of the biodiesel is being supplied from ports situated in the coastal areas. This may involve imported biodiesel, whose sale is strictly banned as per the official policy,” Kadam said. While the Biodiesel (manufacturing, storage, supply, selling) Policy, 2021, of the Maharashtra government governs the biodiesel market, the authorities said the legal framework concerned is yet to gain ground as it is relatively new. “Setting up of a biodiesel outlet requires no objection certificates (NoCs) and clearances from different competent authorities. The process is similar to starting a fuel outlet selling diesel and petrol. Without registration with the competent authority, biodiesel cannot be sold,” Kadam said. According to the Aurangabad Petroleum Dealers’ Association (PDA), some transporters are tempted to buy biodiesel sold in an unauthorised manner due to the rise in diesel prices. “Instead of merely focussing on the crackdown on unauthorised sale of biodiesel, the government should also spread public awareness on the biodiesel policy. A single-window system should be opened at the district level to give speedy clearances for setting up biodiesel outlets. The boost in the sale of such fuel is a win-win situation for the government as well as the consumers,” civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/officials-mwada-has-no-authorised-biodiesel-outlet/articleshow/87026789.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Surat||SMC to meet 35% power demand via renewable sources||Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is probably the only municipal corporation in the country that has developed infrastructure to produce almost 35% of its annual energy demand through renewable sources. SMC is producing electricity through wind, solar and biogas-based power plants. Functioning at their full capacity, these plants can generate total 51-megawatt (MW) electricity annually. Another green power generating unit will be added to the SMC’s list when chief minister Bhupendra Patel inaugurates SMC’s seventh wind power plant (WPP) of 6.3 MW on Friday. The plant has been set up at cost of Rs 42.45 crore in Sukhsan village of Kutch. It can generate 1.82 crore units annually and has a lifespan of 20 years. SMC’s annual power demand is 28 crore units while its renewable energy production capacity is 9.9 crore units. “SMC is probably the only municipal corporation that has developed renewable energy infrastructure that can produce 35% of its annual energy requirement. We are consistently working on this front while also focusing on innovations to further improve renewable energy production,” said city municipal commissioner, Banchhanidhi Pani. SMC setup its first WPP in November 2010 at Gosa village in Porbandar and since then a total six WPP have been developed in Jamnagar, Porbandar and Kutch. Total production of power through WPP is 38.7 MW. SMC has also developed 7 MW solar power plants and 5.35 MW biogas power plants. “By producing renewable energy, we have managed to bring down our annual greenhouse gas emission by 70,000 tonnes. It is a major contribution to counter the effects of climate change,” said K H Khatwani, additional city engineer, SMC. SMC has so far invested Rs 216 crore for setting up of renewable power generation plants. Against the investment it has earned revenues of Rs 254 crore after deducting the operational costs, sources in the civic body said. The previously installed power plants will remain operational for the next 13 years. “As part of innovations, we are exploring how we can install solar power plants in the city,” Pani added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smc-to-meet-35-power-demand-via-renewable-sources/articleshow/87028249.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Lucknow||‘Prolonged Covid infection reactivates dormant viruses in body’||Long-term exposure to Covid-19 infection may reactivate dormant viruses in the patients, leading to multiple medical complications, according to South Korea-based Indian scientist Prof Ram Upadhayaya, who is medicinal scientist, infectious diseases and oncology, and visiting professor at Kwangwoon University, Seoul. He spoke to TOI on this issue. Excerpts: Is there any study on prolonged Covid-19 infection? How many people suffer from it? A study published in science journal ‘Nature’ shows that about 30% of patients developed Covid related complications after contracting (SARS)-CoV-2 infection. What are the reasons behind it? It is the result of immune system dysfunctioning and reactivation of viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex. In many Covid cases, they get reactivated from their usual dormant state after Covid infection. EBV is found in the bone marrow of 90% of people, CMV in 60% of people and herpes simplex in 50% of individuals in the dormant state. Herpes and CMV are found in various body parts. What are the symptoms of infections from these viruses? Symptoms include fatigue, blood disorders, heart problems (myocarditis, inflammatory cardiomyopathy and heart attack) and neurological issues including stroke and hemorrhage. Clinical studies have shown reactivation of EBV in 66.7% of Covid patients. Similarly, CMV and herpes simplex have been triggered by (SARS)-CoV-2. They are responsible for prolonged Covid symptoms and target different body organs. EBV can even lead to hearing loss, blood disorders including blood cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancers. Are there any similarities with other diseases? Reactivation of these viruses can result in overlapping symptoms, specially like coinfection of dengue. Doctors often prescribe symptomatic treatment which gives temporary relief but the situation gets aggravated. How should the infection be treated? Medical screening of patients who suffered from Covid should be done for reactivation of EBV, CMV, herpes, and other viral infections. The screening methods are easily available. Besides, tests to check immune system response should also be performed on such patients. Since treatment is available for these viral infections, they can be treated more efficiently. What should be the future strategy to deal with issues associated with Covid? To win Covid battle, B cell memory-based vaccines should be made as existing vaccines provide immunity for nearly up to nine months. Besides, more BSL 3 and BSL 4 labs should be set up so that future pandemics can be tackled more efficiently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prolonged-covid-infection-reactivates-dormant-viruses-in-body/articleshow/87031632.cms||---

A resident of Salala Barkas, Zubedi was running a western union money transfer business and into importing foreign goods. In January 2019, Hamed Zubedi gave one bag containing gold codenamed “chocolates” to Adil Saleh Jabri in Dubai and asked him to carry it to his Hyderabad home in return for money. Adil Jabri in turn handed it to his brother Rayees who was returning to India from Dubai. But airport customs department caught him and found a gold sheet weighing 1 kg, valued at Rs 35 lakh back in the days. The customs department registered a case on January 5. The customs officials also confiscated Rayees Jabri’s passport. “Zubedi encouraged Jabri to smuggle gold to India, but he was caught at the airport," said a police official. After being released from jail recently, Rayees was in contact with Hamed and demanded money for all expenses related to customs case and pressurised the deceased to get his seized passport released. Zubedi disowned case and expressed his inability to get back the seized passport. On Wednesday afternoon Jabri and his brothers went to Zubedi’s house and threatened to kill him. Zubedi lodged a complaint with Chandrayangutta police but SI S Venkatesh did not act on it resulting in Zubedi’s murder. The four brothers allegedly targeted Zubedi at Hashamabad and hacked him to death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gold-smuggling-case-row-led-to-bizmans-killing/articleshow/87028251.cms||---
---||India||Actor Armaan denied bail in drugs case||A special NDPS court on Thursday denied bail to actor Armaan Kohli arrested in a drugs case filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) of seizure of 1.3gm of cocaine, a small quantity. The court also rejected the bail pleas of two co-accused from whom no recovery was made. The NCB has booked them for illicit trafficking, abetment and conspiracy and the case can’t be dissected for each individual’s role as the crime is all part of the same thread, for the purposes of bail, special public prosecutor Advait Sethna had argued. Kohli had argued for bail on the grounds that no case of illicit trafficking is made out and only a small quantity was alleged to be recovered. But the NCB said the bail plea is “misconceived” and had been rejected by the magistrate on September 4. The actor was arrested on August 28. and booked under the NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/actor-armaan-denied-bail-in-drugs-case/articleshow/87033230.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolhapur||Road fixed ahead of royal ride in Kolhapur||Kolhapur: The patchwork and repair work of the pothole-riddled road leading to Dasara chowk ground from the New Palace has been done ahead of the royal Dasara celebrations at the ground on Friday. The KMC workers had filled up the potholes with gravel before the start of Navaratra in the Mahalaxmi temple area but it was washed away due to heavy rainfall. Most roads in the city are in extremely bad shape and the commuters are facing severe inconvenience. Rohan Sathe, a resident of Nagala Park, said that it was good that the road near Khanwilkar petrol pump was repaired on the eve of Dasara as it had several potholes. “The KMC administration should carry out repair work across the city on an immediate basis,” he said. Another commuter, Prakash Patil, resident of Sane Guruji Vasahat, said that the entire road stretch needs to be re-surfaced and only doing patchwork at the place of potholes won't work for long. “The work should have been carried put before Navaratra as the locals, tourists and devotees are all facing inconvenience. The pothole-riddled roads are creating traffic jams across the city,” he said. The KMC administration had earlier said that the repair works of the pothole filled roads will be starting after the rain recedes and the road repair works are expected to start across the city streets soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/road-fixed-ahead-of-royal-ride-in-kolhapur/articleshow/87026822.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||EDMC to crack the whip on staff absent for a long time||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has issued an order to act against employees who have been absent for a long time. The departments have been asked to issue notices to the employees to join within seven days and take disciplinary action if they fail to do so. The commissioner, in the order, said the progress of services/work was getting hindered by absenteeism. “It has been observed that several employees are absent without notice from their duties for a long time or have left their posts in EDMC. Due to such long absenteeism, the recruitment processes, promotional avenues, overall efficiency of the civic body and commitment to provide hassle-free civic services are adversely affected. In the existing circumstances, it becomes pertinent that action should be taken against such employees,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. “All the heads of department and DDOs have been asked to immediately communicate with the absent employees in their department and ask them to join within seven days, and if they fail to do so, disciplinary action should be initiated. A proposal to initiate disciplinary action against such employees should be placed before the EDMC commissioner,” stated in the order issued by the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-to-crack-the-whip-on-staff-absent-for-a-long-time/articleshow/87030285.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Heroes of the movement||No social change can sustain itself till the community embraces it and people from common walks of life champion the cause. While the government is doing its bit, mobilisation has turned commoners into leaders. As many as seven such persons were felicitated during the Times Water Conclave to magnify the larger message that change begins with you. Felicitating the awardees, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that every single drop joins in to make an ocean. He added that not only the effort of the champions but their ideas also were worth emulating. Save Ponds: As member of the village WASH forum in Chitrakoot, Anil Singh thought beyond the regular realms of conservation. He went out of his way to mobilise 40 marginal farmers to build ponds in their farm with the help of the district administration. The digging work was undertaken during summer months to collect water in the rainy season. His effort provided drinking water for animals and helped in recharging wells in the region. Grey water for irrigation: Meghnath, a resident of Panchgawan village in Jungle Kaudia block of Gorakhpur, showed how using grey water could address the irrigation needs of the people while saving water. He worked with residents to naturally treat domestic waste water in 80 households and use it for irrigation purposes. Grey water forms about 60% of the total waste water from any household. Monitoring water quality: In Fatehpur, quality of water was a key issue behind shortage and wastage. Young graduate Varsha Maurya decided to change the rules. She had attended Jal Chaupal in 2019. Convinced with the idea, she became a Jal Mitra. She identified water quality as the key challenge in her village and was quick to learn the advantages of ‘field testing kit’. In a matter of weeks, she has become the main resource person for water testing. In addition, her village undertakes water quality monitoring before and after monsoon. Keeping the source clean: Life in villages of the Ganga floodplain—under which Bhadohi district falls—is marked by challenges in keeping drinking water sources clean. In Ajaypur village, Urmila Devi developed a plan for water point restoration and convinced the community members to contribute to the initiative to rejuvenate the handpump water point for safe drinking water. With handholding from WaterAid India, she was able to solve the contamination problem in her village. Her effort has fetched her accolades and laurels on various platforms including UNDP’s women water champions. Affordable rainwater harvesting: Sajal Srivastava from Varanasi has developed a low-cost rainwater harvesting structure which can be installed in homes for Rs 4,500. He has removed several components of a traditional structure to make it affordable for domestic use. The filter used in his model costs only about Rs 1,000 and can be attached to the pipe that carries water from the rooftop and cleaned sufficiently to be released directly into the borewell. If required, an additional silt trap can be used which can cover an area of 100 sq mt. This attachment costs Rs 3,500. Save rivers: In western, UP Rajiv Tyagi has been actively contributing towards revival of the Hindon, Kali and Neem rivers since 2016. Raman Kant, the founder and director of Neer Foundation, works on creating awareness on various issues related to water, including involving the community in finding solutions for a sustainable future. The organization has developed a model for river rejuvenation which has been used to revive at least two rivers in Uttar Pradesh: Kali east and Neem. Both are tributaries of the Ganga. It works by carrying out afforestation along river banks, motivating farmers to switch to organic farming and making the river a centre of social activity through ‘Meri Nadi, Meri Pahal’ programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/heroes-of-the-movement/articleshow/87031637.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP: A Muslim family is making ‘Ravan’ for five generations||MEERUT: Mohammad Aslam, 63, and his family have been in the business of making Ravan effigies for Ramlila for five generations in Uttar Pradesh. This year, their major highlight is a 60 feet tall effigy of the demon which will be put to flames in Meerut’s largest Ramlila in Sadar Bazar. Aslam's brother, Yunus, too, has been in the same trade for decades. The family has been busy giving the final touches. This time, Ravan here will also look like a “coronavirus” which the family says "will soon disappear from the lives of people". The "Covid Ravan" will be set on fire in Kankarkhera on Friday. With little time remaining, Aslam’s sons Akram, 28, Waseem, 26, and Salman, 24, are assisting him in the work. Akram, sitting a few metres away, is about to finish a Ravan effigy for a local family who wants to burn the demon on their terrace. Mridul Kumar waits patiently with his 12-year-old son Sanket to take it home. “I, too, want my son to study. To earn well. This trade is dying,” Akram says. The family is not only involved in making tall effigies of the mythological demon, but also gives shape to "smaller Ravans". These are usually sold to people who want to host events in private spaces and set the demon on fire outside their homes or other local premises. Since the trade was badly hit last year due to the pandemic, Aslam is expecting a little more earning for his family this year. “Humare abba Ravan banate the, unke abba bhi. Humare bete bhi Ravan banate hain aur unke bete bhi (my father used to make Ravan and his father as well. My son makes Ravan now and his son joins him),” Aslam explains to TOI. His family, who also makes "tazia", decorates wedding pandals and sells kites whenever there is a festive occasion, feels happy to spread the "message of brotherhood and harmony in society". They take a lot of pride in their work too. Yunus says that his work is the best in the city. They work meticulously on minute details while giving shape to the effigy with the "aim of making it look as real as possible". They sell 10 to 15 feet Ravan for local areas and households for Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,500 while a 50-60 feet effigy costs Rs 25,000. Almost 60% to 70% of their income is usually spent in the expenses of shaping up the demon, they say. “We want Covid to end this year. Our business has suffered enough due to it. We had to work as labourers as there was very little work,” Yunus adds when asked about his favourite "Covid Ravan" and the other demons ready to go up in flames.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/a-muslim-family-who-is-making-ravan-for-five-generations/articleshow/87028266.cms||Ishita Mishra

All the accused were produced before court on Thursday and remanded to judicial custody. Cops said that accused revenue officials identified beneficiaries not staying in the village or who had died to misuse cheques meant for them, instead of returning the amount to state. Fraud was carried out in collusion with one clerk of a bank in Nampally mandal in Nalgonda. “When beneficiary is not available, cheques have to be returned to the government. But 547 such cheques amounting to Rs 61.5 lakh were missing,” additional SP Narmada said. The 23 accused include one deputy tahsildar, one revenue inspector, four VROs, four VRAs, a bank clerk and 12 mediators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/23-arrested-for-rs-61-5-lakh-rythu-bandhu-fund-fraud/articleshow/87028257.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra attains 50% of target in week-long special Covid vaccination drive||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has achieved 50% of the target it set for itself during the week-long special vaccination drive conducted by the state. Around 50 lakh people took a Covid shot between October 8 and 14, the original duration of Mission Kawach Kundal that was organized with a target of around 1 crore jabs. As the state still has 50 lakh vaccine shots left from last week’s 1 crore stocks sent by the Centre, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said the mission has been extended. The mission was announced on October 7 with a mandate to vaccinate 15 lakh a day, but the turnout has been less than anticipated due to the ongoing Navratri festival. “We still managed to vaccinate around 7 lakh on an average every day and that is a good number,” Tope said. The minister said the 15-lakh mark was a “big goal” intended to motivate people towards inoculation. “At this moment, people who understand the significance of vaccination have already taken the shots. Those left out are either those who don’t believe in vaccination or are underprivileged or have special needs. The mission is an attempt to handhold them,” said Tope. He said the special drive was also held in response to the Central government's plan to complete 100 crore vaccinations by Dusshera. Maharashtra, which has given out over nine crore shots, has managed to vaccinate 68% of its 9.14 crore adult population with the first shot. This is less than the overall coverage nationally for the first dose – 73% – but Maharashtra does lead other Indian states in terms of having the highest number of fully vaccinated people (2.76 crore or 30% of its adult population). “Our target is ‘vaccination for 100% of our people’, but even if we manage to fully vaccinate 90 to 95%, it would be fine,” said Tope. Maharashtra has to be in “mission mode” as vaccination is the best bet against the third wave, he added. Officials said with the current phase of the festive season coming to an end and two weeks to go for Diwali, the government is hoping that immunisation will pick up pace from next week. “There is still a demand in rural areas but the festive season and harvesting season is keeping people away,” said an official. Officials also said they will reach out to prominent personalities and religious leaders to create more awareness in certain regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-attains-50-of-target-in-week-long-spl-vax-drive/articleshow/87031739.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||India||Aryan now in general cell, has video call with parents||MUMBAI: Twelve days after his arrest in a drug case, actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan spoke to his parents for the first time from the Arthur Road jail through a mobile video call. This facility was introduced by jail authorities during the pandemic last year for inmates to communicate with their families and lawyers. Aryan was sent to the Arthur Road jail after an NDPS court sent him to judicial custody last week. “Aryan gave his mother’s number. He spoke to his mother and father through the video call facility for 10 minutes,” confirmed a senior jail official. As per norms, undertrials can talk to their family/lawyers twice or thrice a month in the presence of jail police constables. At present, Arthur Road has 11 smartphone handsets. In another development, Aryan and six others, all arrested in the same drug case by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), have been shifted from the jail’s quarantine cell. “All inmates, who were kept in the quarantine cell, have been shifted to general cells,” said a jail officer. Last week, Aryan and others were kept in a quaran-tine cell as per the rule. An inmate who is brought to the jail is first kept at the quarantine cell for three to five days and is transferred to a regular cell once his Covid test result is negative. In June last year, the Maharashtra prison department had stopped physical meetings (mulaqat) of prisoners with family members and lawyers due to the pandemic and introduced the video calling facility instead. As a result, 55 smartphones in over three dozen jails were installed at that time. The facility has helped many prisoners, said a jail officer, adding that an inmate gets to talk to his family face-to-face via video call. “It is time- and cost-effective,” a jail official had earlier said. Prison departments had during the pandemic created dedicated email IDs for each prison. A lawyer can visit the website www.mahaprisons.gov.in and send an e-mail to the concerned prison authorities, if he/she wants to communicate with his/her client. An email may contain an inmate’s name, cell or barrack number, court case number etc. Once the jail authorities sanction the e-meeting, a time slot is allotted to a lawyer as when s/he can communicate to the client for a maximum of 10 to 15 minutes. Prior to introducing this facility, a lawyer or family members would have to come to the jail, get themselves registered in the mulaqat register and then they would be able to meet an inmate. The Arthur Road jail may start the physical mulaqat of inmates with their relatives from next week as the collector has given the go-ahead, said a source. Besides this, the phone-calling facility through coin boxes was also introduced in the jails last year. Prisoners, lodged in various jails, could make phone calls from 60 coin boxes to their relatives. However, there is no coin box phone in Arthur Road jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aryan-now-in-general-cell-has-video-call-with-parents/articleshow/87033234.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Based on the preliminary inquiry, city police commissioner Ajay Tomar issued orders for the transfer of PI K I Modi of Umra police station and special branch SI B S Parmar. Two constables Isardan Gadhvi and Dharmendragiri Goswami were suspended. “The cops were found responsible for negligence in the inquiry and based on the investigation report, disciplinary action was taken against them,” Tomar told TOI. Meanwhile, on Thursday members of ABVP held dharna outside colleges in the city and blocked roads. The student body of BJP demanded action against cops who had allegedly thrashed students on Monday at VNSGU campus. The garba was organised despite the police’s refusal to grant permission since it was prohibited as per government notification. The event that was initially planned by biotechnology department students for around 100 participants was hijacked by a group to organise it at a larger scale on the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pi-si-transferred-two-constables-suspended/articleshow/87028339.cms||---
---||Nashik||Diesel crosses Rs 100/l-mark in Nashik city on Thursday||Nashik/Kolhapur: Diesel price in Nashik city on Thursday recorded an all-time high at Rs 100.27 per litre, against Rs 99.91 per litre on Monday. The diesel price here has increased by Rs 21 over the past 10 months. Earlier, diesel price was recorded at Rs 79.01 per litre on December 4, but since then, it has continued to rise. Petrol price, meanwhile, has risen to Rs 111.18 per litre. Petrol price has also gone up by Rs 21 per litre since December 4, when it was Rs 90.07 per litre. The Nashik Transporters’ Association (NTA) has expressed its concerns. “Our businesses have been badly hit due to the frequent fuel price hikes. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the transport sector. Now, the sector is in a recovery mode, but the continuous fuel price rise is hurting it,” said Rajendra Phad, the NTA president. “We sign an annual agreement with the corporate firms and industries. Therefore, we can’t change the transportation costs until the agreement period is over. We have to face huge losses if the fuel prices continue to go up. We want the central and state governments to reduce taxes and bring down the fuel prices in public interest,” he added. Farmers are also worried. “Most farming activities are done using diesel-based tractor-mounted equipment. The cost for harvesting grain using these machines has almost doubled over the past year” said Nivrutti Nyaharkar, a farmer. “Ploughing charges have also increased by 25% during the same period. Earlier, we paid Rs 2,000 to plough per acre using the tractors. Now, the ploughing rates have increased to Rs 2,500 per acre. The cost of production has increased and farming has become the loss-making business. We want the Centre to provide diesel to farmers at a subsidised rate,” Nyaharkar added. Meanwhile, in Kolhapur, diesel price was just shy of the Rs 100-mark on Thursday at Rs 99.95 per litre. This is the highest recorded diesel price in the city so far. In March 2020, the price of diesel here was Rs 64 per litre. Fuel pump operators claim the price may cross Rs 100 mark by Friday, as has been increasing by 20-40 paise almost every day for the past week. On Wednesday, diesel cost Rs 99.59 per litre. Gajkumar Mangave, the district president of petrol pump operators, said, “Given the short supply and increased global demand as countries recover from the pandemic, the fuel prices are bound to increase. We get to know of the rise (or fall) in prices by in late evening every day, and the prices change automatically at the pumps by 6 am the next day.” “Now, many prefer to share cabs or autorickshaws to save on fuel cost. Some are riding triple-seat. As the rains have stopped, farmers will have to resort to canal irrigation. For that, they would have to use diesel pumps. Such farmers will have to bear the brunt,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/diesel-crosses-rs-100/l-mark-in-nashik-city-on-thursday/articleshow/87026827.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NMC GB increases funds for repairing roads to Rs 130cr||Nagpur: The general body of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in a special meeting held on Wednesday increased funds for repairing roads by Rs26.5 crore to Rs129.65 crore from Rs103.15 crore allotted in the budget for current fiscal. It is still Rs15 crore less than that approved by the standing committee a few days ago. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that efforts are going on to soon allot Rs8 crore more for repairing roads. “Our hot mix plant has resumed operation. Two machines are already repairing roads amid rains. Accepting our request, the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has started one of two hot mix plants on Wednesday and commence road repairs. Its second plant will also start. Officials of state’s public works department (PWD) have assured to repair seven roads,” he said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari tremed the special GB meeting as historic. “Till now, civic chiefs used to slash budget presented by the standing committee in December or later. For the first time, reappropriation of funds has been done in October and budget not cut. Today, approval was given for reappropriation of Rs36.5 crore. Funds unused in six heads have been diverted to four heads. This will ensure pothole repairs as well as tarring of major roads,” he said. Tiwari added, “The special meeting held on September 27 too was historic in nature as it discussed works done by the administration in the last one-and-a-half years. Administration said condition of many roads was bad as no work was taken up in last one-and-a-half years. Though being a tough and lengthy process, the administration tabled proposal for reappropriation of funds within 15 days. It was approved to provide relief to citizens from potholes,” he said. Few days ago, the standing committee had approved reappropriation and hiked funds for repairing roads by Rs41.5 crore. Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre said, “Administration did not consider reappropriation of Rs15 crore but these funds will also be spent on repairing of roads. There will be no shortage of funds and 16 major roads will be tarried totally,” he said. The general body also approved reappropriation and allocated Rs10 crore more for bio-mining of garbage. All 399 city buses to run from Oct 18 With the state government resuming all commercial and other activities, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Wednesday granted approval to resume the city bus service completely. All city buses are likely to ply on roads from October 18. Currently, 299 buses are in operation — 228 standard-size, midi 134, mini 31 and electric 6. Radhakrishnan approved to increase the fleet by 100. Now, 399 buses are likely to ply from October 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-gb-increases-funds-for-repairing-roads-to-rs-130cr/articleshow/87020932.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots case: Miscarriage of justice to not believe witnesses, says court||NEW DELHI: A city court has framed charges against nine people accused in a northeast Delhi riots case saying it would be a miscarriage of justice to disbelieve witnesses at this stage and throw out the prosecution case merely because their statements were recorded after about one month of the incident. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said the delay in recording the statements of the witnesses did not appear to be deliberate or contumacious. “It appears to have occasioned on account of the situation that prevailed in the area during and after the rioting and, therefore, the accused cannot claim discharge merely on this score. The truthfulness or otherwise of the statements of these witnesses can be assessed only during trial,” the court said. The charges included IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 380 (theft), 427 (mischief), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 452 (house-trespass). The offences entail a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Police claimed the nine accused were allegedly part of a mob that vandalised and burnt public and private properties. The counsel for the accused claimed that the witnesses were not trustworthy because their statements had been recorded after a delay of over a month. The court stated, “It is to be noted that this case is an offshoot of communal riots that erupted in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020 and continued till February 26 when the situation was brought under control by police and paramilitary forces. There were instances of rioting, killing, looting, vandalising, setting ablaze movable and immovable properties, etc. There was an atmosphere of terror and trauma that prevailed in the area for several days after the riots.” It further noted that, as submitted by the public prosecutor, the witnesses had become so terrified that they were reluctant to come forth and present their version of the incident before the investigating agency. The judge also took note of the prosecution’s submission that soon after the situation became normal to some extent, the pandemic resulted in a complete lockdown from the second week of March 2020, which also delayed recording of the statements of witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/miscarriage-of-justice-to-not-believe-witnesses-says-court/articleshow/87030368.cms||Usha Das
---||Surat||Hearing impaired Maharashtra teen rescued||SURAT: City police united a 15-year-old speech and hearing-impaired boy from Maharashtra with his father. The boy had run away from his home three days ago after being scolded by his uncle over watching TV. He was also provided a hearing aid machine. His father told TOI that it is his third attempt to run away from home. Due to inability to hear he could not speak as well. Abhijeet Shegokar, a resident of Khamgaon in Buldhana, was spotted by H V Goti, police inspector in traffic police, near Kangaroo circle in Puna area on Wednesday morning. He was crying incessantly. “I tried to ask him why he was crying but he was unable to speak and later I realized that he can’t even hear. Later I took help of a social worker and found his village,” Goti told TOI. Friends for women and children (FFWC), an initiative of CID Crime, coordinator Piyush Shah took help of a teacher at a school for special children over video call. “Once it was clear that he was from Maharashtra we asked him to search his village over mobile phone through the internet. He searched for a video of his school in Khamgaon,” said Shah. Police contacted the local police station in Buldhana and took their help to trace the boy’s father Prashant, who had not filed a missing complaint for Abhijeet. “He ran away when he was five-year-old and again at the age of 12 and this is the third time. Earlier he was found from nearby villages but this time he came this far,” said Prashant. The hearing aid device was provided by the department of social defence. After leaving home on Tuesday the boy boarded a private passenger bus and hid himself under a seat. He was spotted by the bus cleaner in the morning and was asked to get down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/hearing-impaired-maha-teen-rescued/articleshow/87028357.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Nashik||Penalty for using properties without completion certificate||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has proposed a penalty for the residential properties, which are being used without getting building completion certificates (BCCs) from the civic body. The panlty has been waived for residential properties measuring less than 600 square feet, but properties measuring between 601 sq ft and 1,000 sqft will have to pay 50% of the annual property tax as penalty every year until they get the BCCs. The residential properties of 1,001 sq ft or more will have to pay a penalty, that will be two times the property tax until they get the certificates. As per the norms, it is mandatory to obtain BBCs from the NMC following completion of the building projects. But in many cases, people start staying in the properties without getting the BCCs. The proposal in this connection is to be tabled at the general body meeting of NMC for its approval. The meeting will be held on October 20. NMC officials said they have plans to bring new properties, which have been built but have not obtained BCCs and residents are staying there, under the tax net. “Such properties are on our radar. The penalty is to be recovered from the day of the commencement certificate given to such residential building projects” said NMC officials. According to NMC officials, it is difficult right now to know the exact number of properties that are there without BCCs. But over 20,000 such properties across the city are said to be there. However, the civic body has also proposed giving relief to the smaller properties below 600 sq ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/penalty-for-using-properties-without-completion-certificate/articleshow/87026853.cms||Tushar Pawar

The demand for flowers, particularly marigolds, has increased in the city due to the ongoing Navaratra festival and Dasara on Friday. According to the farmers, the price is expected to increase further as there is a shortage of marigolds due to recent heavy rain that has damaged the marigold plantation. “This year was not so good as half of the 1.5 acre plantation of marigold has been damaged due to the heavy rain. So there has been a drop in the supply and that has led to the rise in marigold prices,” said Rajendra Awate, a farmer. “Also, the quality of flowers has been damaged to some extent. This has impacted the price of marigolds. Last year, we had fetched Rs 400 per crate rate for marigold, but the rates are lesser this year due to the quality of the flower,” he said. “The marigold prices have increased in the last two days. But the supply is comparatively still low,” said Nitin Malode, a farmer. There has been a high demand for marigolds during festivals like Navaratra and Dasara as people use flowers for puja, to decorate homes, shops, vehicle etc The new flower market in Ganeshwadi, Panchavati, and the banks of the Godavari river near Dhahipul bridge witnessed a huge rush of farmers selling marigolds. Farmers from adjoining talukas like Chandvad, Niphad, Dindori and villages around the cities had brought flowers in crates loaded in pick-up vans and other vehicles on Thursday early morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/marigold-prices-rise-by-50/articleshow/87026850.cms||Tushar Pawar

In the letter to vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, the students said, “Due to the recent developments in Afghanistan, we are stranded here and feel deeply concerned about our academic future and our stay in India. This comes at a time when our return to Afghanistan would be a threat to our lives.” The students have already completed their respective MA courses from the varsity and have appeared for the Ph.D entrance examinations. “Considering the fact that there is no quota for foreign students in Ph.D courses, this will inevitably affect the future of Afghan students who have given entrance exams and will be deprived of seats as they cannot return to their country due to the unfolding situation there. This might highly affect our stay in India and could risk us being forced to go back if we are not given any seats under the foreign national category,” the letter read. The letter added, “We sincerely request the VC of JNU to ease the process of getting admission by providing quota, cutoff or any possible way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-students-write-to-vc-seek-breather-for-afghan-candidates/articleshow/87030398.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||Talks on eco-sensitive zone rekindle hopes of better future for 20 Bijnor villages||BIJNOR: As officials from UP and Uttarakhand prepare to work out the details on declaring an eco-sensitive zone along the Corbett and Amangarh Tiger Reserves, residents of some 20 villages finally hope to see their long-standing demand fulfilled. According to law, no commercial activity can take place within a 10-km radius of a wildlife reserve. As a result, a 30-km stretch in UP bordering the Corbett tiger reserve (CTR) and a 15-km stretch along Amangarh tiger reserve (ATR), where these 20 villages are located, is bereft of all commercial and industrial activity. Unemployment is widespread and has spawned a host of illegal activities like felling forest trees for timber and distilling illicit liquor at these villages. These include Kehariwala, Badigarh,Jamunwala, Murliwala, Meerapur, Kalluwala, Bhagota, Harelvi, Matlabpur, Kuwankhera, Kadrabad, Rasoolabad, Jawednagar Shahjadpur and Chakpheri. Explaining why the declaration of an eco-sensitive zone will prove to be a boon for the local people, retired divisional forest officer (DFO) Saleel Kumar Shukla said, “During my tenure seven years ago, a proposal was sent for declaring an eco-sensitive zone within 2-3 km radius of the forest border, but no action was taken at the state level. In 2018, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had also written to various state governments to declare eco-sensitive zones around tiger reserves.” The eco-sensitive area will open up the area for commercial activity and new avenues of employment, say local villagers who have been pressing for it for years. M Semmaran, Bijnor DFO, said, “A joint meeting of Corbett authorities and Uttarakhand and UP forest departments has been called to address the issue. We are to prepare a proposal for an eco-sensitive zone along ATR which is a buffer zone of CTR. Corbett authorities have to create their eco-sensitive zone in a 30-km stretch along the forest border. Though Corbett is in Uttarakhand, its eco-sensitive zone will be in UP. Therefore, the matter pertains to both states.” Rajeev Kumar of Harevali village said it is not just the lack of industries in the area that affects them but the restrictions also pose a hurdle in agricultural work. Three seasonal rivers -- Dhara, Pili and Fik -- that pass through Amangarh deposit their debris on agricultural fields, he said, “We are unable to desilt the land after monsoon as use of machines is not allowed for clearing the land strewn with gravel, stones and sand left behind by the receding flood waters. The price of our land is very low here because of unnecessary restrictions imposed by forest authorities." Besides, the yield is low due to poor fertility, said Mohit from Murliwala village. The problem can be resolved if the eco-sensitive zone is declared, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-ukhand-talks-on-eco-sensitive-zone-rekindle-hopes-of-better-future-for-20-bijnor-villages/articleshow/87028366.cms||Harveer Dabas

Only the working committee members will be present for the effigy burning with a promise that they will telecast the event on social media. Effigy makers from Gujarat, Jalore and Sirohi had reached Jaipur almost a month ago and are seen at New Sanganer Road, B2B Bypass, Tonk Road, Vaishali Nagar, Raja Park, Ravan Mandi in the capital. In Jaipur, mammoth effigies used to be the centre of attraction, but Covid restrictions have urged the organisers to keep it a low-key affair. The oldest and longest 105-feet ‘Ravana Dahan’ programme and the glimpse of the panoramic fireworks will be missing this time at the Dussehra Maidan in Raja Park. “We will have a function in which the committee members will light the effigy and we will telecast the event on social media,” said an organiser at Aadarsh Nagar Ramleela Maidan. Also, big Ramleela committees have promised not to organise any big function. “There would be complete prohibition on the entry of the general public and no fireworks would be used,” said an organiser of Dussehra function at Mansarovar. Meanwhile, effigy makers have also made smaller effigies available at Rs 200 to Rs 2,000 per piece. “There are hardly any takers for the second consecutive year. However, compared to last year, the things are a little better,” said Jagdish Nath, an effigy maker at Gopalpura Mode. Some people, however, purchased effigies on Dussehra eve for their families and housing societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/a-low-key-digital-dussehra-this-time/articleshow/87030378.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB seeking MEA help to probe Aryan Khan’s alleged foreign contact, says ASG Anil Singh||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau special counsel, ASG Anil Singh, who concluded his submissions on Thursday, said Aryan Khan’s bail plea was misconceived at this stage as investigations are still on and the agency is seeking help of the Ministry of External Affairs to probe Khan’s alleged foreign contact and chats to probe an alleged international connection. He also said that since there is a commercial quantity of drugs recovered from other accused, the fetters on bail would apply under Section 37 of the Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The section makes it difficult for bail to be granted when an offence involves commercial quantity. The ASG also denied Khan’s submissions of no possession, as he said that since Merchant was found with charas and both admitted to wanting to smoke it, it became his “conscious possession.” Desai said not only was no drug found on Khan, the alleged statements, both of which have been retracted, at best speak of future consumption of small quantities of charas, a drug legal in many countries for small quantities. Desai added, “Abdul Shaikh (from whom commercial quantity was allegedly recovered) was named by another accused who Khan and Merchant have no connection with, and they cannot be dragged into or made part of such conspiracy now when their arrest did not involve any abetment or conspiracy allegation.” Singh said NCB can invoke Section 29 of the NDPS Act (conspiracy) at any stage during investigation. Desai denied the allegations and said, “It is false to say that he (Khan) is involved in any drug trafficking or drug chain and it is an inherently absurd allegation.” He said the government had in 2001 amended the Act to make it more rational and reformative, dropping a five-year punishment to one year for small quantity of drugs. “In 2017 the government brought in a policy which talks about peddler and said awareness campaigns be run to prevent drug abuse and educate and also for younger school children to sensitize them.” To Singh’s submission that NCB is a responsible agency and doing its job, Desai said, “I fully agree with Singh about the great work that NCB is doing.” He added, “Not only in India but across the world there is a drug menace that is needed to be tackled. Kudos to the department, they say they even put their lives in danger to protect society, but liberty is of utmost importance too and the reformative doctrine be heeded.” Desai pointed to the Rhea Chakraborty bail judgment to say that NCB had argued that celebrities be dealt with harshly as they are model citizens, but the HC had not agreed with the proposition of a ‘harsh’ treatment to them. He said, “I hope it is not happening that because of his celeb status, there is some harsh outlook by the agency.” Singh also said the NDPS Act looks at the intent of the accused first. Desai cited an SC judgment to say it can only be looked at during trial, not bail proceedings. Khan was arrested on October 3 following a raid by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on a Mumbai-Goa cruise ship at the international terminal in Mumbai on October 2. From Merchant and Dhamecha, NCB said it recovered 6 grams of charas and 5 gm hashish respectively. The bail pleas of other accused including Aachit Kumar, 22, who NCB on Thursday said is a “peddler” and Nupur Satija, Mohak Jaiswal and Avin Sahu will be taken up for reply of the NCB next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-seeking-mea-help-to-probe-aryans-alleged-foreign-contact/articleshow/87030508.cms||Swati Deshpande

According to sources, a farmer of Kuranga village had approached ACB with a complaint against Bhetariya. He alleged that Bhetariya had sought Rs 3 lakh from him for helping him get a licence for firearms. The farmer wanted the firearms to protect his farm from wild animals. The ACB sleuths set up a trap and were present in Bhetariya’s office as local applicants. As soon as the revenue officer accepted the cash from the complainant, ACB sleuths nabbed him.

People’s Union for Civil Liberties and other NGOs, have written letter to Gehlot asking till how long such incidences will keep on occurring in the state. The letter quotes “Many incidents of lynching or seriously injuring Dalits have come to the fore in the last 7 days in Rajasthan. Although after the incidents of Jalore and Hanumangarh, FIR was registered and the accused were arrested. But it has become clear that the rule of law is slowly coming to an end in Rajasthan and the poor, Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims are targeted by the dominant castes. The women of all the marginalized sections are being targeted even more and the sexual crimes are increasing day by day.” All civil organizations want to emphasize that the role of police is very questionable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/attack-on-dalits-ngos-write-to-cm/articleshow/87030431.cms||---
---||Goa||Lobo, Mandrekar clash over free harvester machine||Saligao: The free distribution of a harvesting machine to farmers of Siolim created tensions in the constituency and ended in a verbal clash between two BJP groups in the constituency. “We got the harvesting machines from Karnataka after making several calls, but some goons used power and influence and forcefully took away the machine. We will not retaliate, but people know that for the last 20 years no one has helped the farmers, by either providing them tractors and harvesting machines or even seedlings,” Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said. Speaking to reporters on the issue, Lobo blamed former BJP MLA and minister Dayanand Mandrekar, though without naming him. He alleged that he was doing “dadagiri” over the petty issue of a harvesting machine. He said that he bought the machine with his money, but the former MLA wanted to take credit for it. The ports minister’s wife Delilah and Mandrekar are both vying for a ticket from the constituency. Tensions had built soon after the machine arrived in Oxel, Siolim on Wednesday night after a few people along with relatives of a former BJP MLA arrived at the site. Lobo alleged that they not only took away the keys of the machine, but also threatened the driver and took away his phone. Then, on Thursday morning, Mandrekar arrived along with police protection and inaugurated the machine. Mandrekar has been water resources minister in the BJP government. “The farmers did not like what happened and attempts to threaten and slap the driver do not augur well for the party. From this it is evident that these are desperate attempts to threaten people by doing dadagiri,” he said. Lobo said that one year ago he had announced that he would try and provide everything free of cost but “someone” is alleging that he is “providing the farmers machines free of cost only to confuse and brainwash them”. Such behaviour is an attempt to instil fear in people’s minds and a show of power to win votes by “using dadagiri and brute force”, said Lobo. “By doing dadagiri it is not possible to win elections.” Asked if he along with the farmers would file a police complaint, Lobo said that there was no use of filing a police complaint as the former MLA has said that police are under his control. “I urge the chief minister to please look into such practices of dadagiri, which should not be tolerated,” Lobo said. Mandrekar on the other hand rubbished Lobo’s claims saying the keys were taken away by police, but police denied it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-mandrekar-clash-over-free-harvester-machine/articleshow/87031763.cms||---

A meeting between the smart city officials, environmentalists and officials from a Nagpur-based private firm, which manufactures ozone generators used to treat sewage, was held on Thursday. The smart city officials have asked the firm to give demonstrations on the ozonation plant that could be set up at Ramkund. The trials are likely to be conducted before municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav and NMSCDCL CEO Sumant More. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist and petitioner in the Godavari pollution case, who was also present in the meeting, said, Ramkund has its own importance as lakhs of sadhus and devotees take a holy dip here during the Kumbh Mela held in Nashik once every 12 years. Thousands of devotees from across the country visit Ramkund every day. Most of them take a holy dip and some even carry the water with them as ‘tirtha’. So the water needs to be pure and potable considering the health of the devotees, said Pandit. “The ozonation technology is already being used at some places in the country. The company will soon give actual trials on how the ozonation wastewater treatment technology works,” added Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ozonation-plant-being-planned-at-nashiks-ramkund/articleshow/87026858.cms||Tushar Pawar

The accused was nabbed in Solapur and brought to Nashik. Goods and cash worth Rs 13.8 lakh have been recovered from the accused. Police inspector Sunil Jadhav said the accused changed his location and hiding spots daily before he was trapped in Solapur using local intelligence and technical support. On October 3, the complainant (the car owner) had gone to a salon at Canada Corner. When he returned to his car, the vehicle was locked and the driver could not be found. The owner’s bag, with Rs 15 lakh in cash, was also missing. Subsequently, he registered a complaint with the Sarkarwada police on October 6. The police formed teams to nab the driver, who was a resident of Cidco. Using technical support, the police were able to track the driver’s mobile phone. They also used local intelligence to find out the location of the accused. He allegedly had been hiding in Hyderabad, Guntur, Dhule, Pune, Ahmednagar, and Bengaluru among other places. “While tracking location, the police found the accused hiding in Solapur for a longer time. They zeroed in on his place of residence and caught him,” Jadhav said. Rs 12.25 lakh in cash was recovered from the driver, along with a smartphone worth Rs 50,000 and gold ornaments worth Rs 1 lakh purchased using the stolen money. The accused was presented in a local court. He has been remanded in police custody till October 16. The police wanted to recover the remaining 1.2 lakh from the accused and, hence, sought his police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/driver-held-for-stealing-rs-15l-from-car/articleshow/87026863.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Dasara tradition clips wings of state bird Palapitta, many die in captivity||HYDERABAD: Palapitta or the Indian Roller bird, which is the state bird of Telangana, is being sold for as little as Rs 50, with poachers in Hyderabad and different parts of the state exploiting the belief that sighting the bird during Dasara is considered good omen. According to animal welfare organisations, the birds are captured at least a month before the festival, their legs tied, wings trimmed or stuck with glue to prevent them from flying. P Teja of Humane Society International said, “The birds are usually starved till Dasara and kept in small cages for public viewing. Most of these birds die in captivity or immediately after being released. On the day of Dasara, many devotees pay to buy these birds from local markets and release them as a good deed which they believe will absolve them of their sins. They don’t realise that this ritual is actually killing hundreds of birds every year.” The Indian Roller is protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which makes its capture, hunting and trade illegal. The penalty is Rs 25,000 or imprisonment. Animal rescue volunteers and the forest department urged citizens to not support atrocities against the bird and report poachers and traders to authorities on round-the-clock helpline numbers: 1800-425-5364 or 040-23231440.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dasara-tradition-clips-wings-of-statebird-palapitta-many-die-in-captivity/articleshow/87028409.cms||---
---||Delhi||2.5 Seconds To Voice Your Views On Shape Delhi Will Take In Next 20 Yrs||New Delhi: From Monday, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will start public hearings for finalising the Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) 2041. The authority has received more than 33,000 suggestions and objections for the draft MPD-2041 and 17,162 people who had submitted their suggestions will take part in the process. More than 1,400 people are on average being given a chance to speak during 12 one-hour slots over two days. The suggestions and objections would be placed before a board of inquiry and hearing. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the hearing would be conducted online on October 18 and 20. There would be six one-hour slots for hearings on both days. On average, there would be more than 1,400 people in each slot trying to voice their vision for Delhi for the next 20 years. Each person would be sent a link to the online meeting through email or SMS, along with a unique ID and password. Shalaka Chauhan, coordinator of Main Bhi Dilli campaign, which has been participating in the process since 2018, said the schedule was exclusionary. “The issue with the schedule is that if we follow it, each citizen won’t even get 30 seconds to voice their feedback on the draft plan. We are concerned that people will not get enough time and space to be part of this critical process,” she added. Chauhan also said that the campaign had supported the vulnerable and marginalised citizens, including residents of informal settlements and informal workers to physically file objections and suggestions. It found that most people were not familiar with the online mode as a medium of consultation and found it complicated and inconvenient. The campaign said citizens had been waiting for this opportunity and it was most likely that technical barriers and the short period allowed would result in prohibition of voices and representation of citizens. “Even if 1,000 people want to give serious suggestions, how many seconds would they get? This is ridiculous,” said Rajiv Kakria of Save Our City campaign. “I have attended many public hearings in the last 15 years and have got at least 20 minutes to speak. This can’t be allowed,” he added. BS Vohra, president of East Delhi Joint Front, said, “If DDA is giving less than a minute to people to voice their suggestions, it is just a formality. Spread out the public hearing for over a month, what is the hurry?” “All those who have registered queries and given suggestions will be heard. If more time is required, DDA is open to that,” said a DDA spokesperson. Main Bhi Dilli campaign has written to the DDA vice-chairman demanding that public hearings should be accessible and decentralised, with multiple physical public hearings at every zonal office and everyone should get appropriate time to speak. It has also suggested that DDA make public a comprehensive list of suggestions and objections received, along with their status of inclusion or non-inclusion in the final plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-5-seconds-to-voice-your-views-on-shape-delhi-will-take-in-next-20-yrs/articleshow/87030458.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Nashik||In just 40 days, tomato prices jump from Rs 2.5/kg to Rs 22/kg||Nashik: Tomato prices are pinching the pockets of citizens with the rate of the kitchen staple shooting up dramatically in just 40 days. From an average wholesale rate of Rs 2.5 a kg in the first week of September, tomatoes are now selling at Rs 25 a kg at Pimpalgaon market in Nashik district, the country's largest tomato wholesale market. Heavy rainfall in September and the Gulab cyclone left hectares of fields damaged in Nashik and Kolhapur regions. An estimated 10 lakh farmers cultivate tomatoes in Nashik district alone, making up for almost 20% of the country’s production. The impact of the damage can be felt in retail markets of the state with tomatoes selling at a steep Rs 60 a kg in Nashik, Rs 100 in Kolhapur and Rs 80 in Mumbai. “Currently, the daily arrival of tomatoes at the Pimpalgaon agriculture produce market committee is around 1.70 lakh crates (20 kg a crate) per day. During the same period last year, we would get 3.5 lakh crates a day. The drop in supply as compared to demand has led to a rise in wholesale tomato prices,” said Deepak Gavli, who looks after tomato sales at the Pimpalgaon APMC. Gavli said around 50% of the tomato crop in Nashik district has been hit due to the recent heavy rain. “Now, the new tomato fruits in the existing plantation will come in very low quantity. Hence, the supply will continue to dip further,” he said. Bhikchand Parakh, a tomato trader, said the price trend of tomatoes will be upward and the situation will come under control only after the new crops start arriving after three weeks. Farmers, who dumped their tomatoes on road in after the fall in prices in September, are ruing their stance. Somnath Kulagi, farmer from Jat tehsil of Sangli district, had dumped the tomatoes outside the mandi as the wholesale prices dropped to Rs 1.5 per kg. Now, he is being called by traders to check if he has any produce in the farm. Somnath had destroyed all tomato crop and took up chilli cultivation. “It was for the first time that I suffered heavy losses. Now, when I see that the tomatoes are fetching such a good price, I feel my decision to destroy the crop was wrong. I would have made up for the loss I faced then,” he told TOI. Zuber, a vegetable vendor in Kolhapur said, they get most of the tomato supply from Shirol, Sangli and Solapur region. Due to the flood, the farm produce has been impacted in Sangli and Shirol. The farmers from Solapur region are sending their produce to Mumbai, affecting supply to the southern Maharashtra city. Navnath Chavan, a farmer from Lasur in Aurangabad district, said the recent rain fury had damaged tomato cultivation to a major extent. “I had cultivated tomato crop over 15 guntha, majority of which was destroyed. Whatever produce could be harvested is being sold now by farmers with minimal profit,” he said. Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) president Jagannath Kale said that besides the natural calamity, the rise in diesel prices is also partially responsible for rise in prices of tomatoes and other vegetables. Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section at the market yard, Gultkedi, Pune, said, the arrival of tomato has decreased as many plantations have been badly affected. Moreover, the demand is high as many hotels, restaurants, eateries and food giants have reopened to full capacity. “Considering these factors, the rates will remain high at least for the next few weeks,” he said. Satish Pote, a tomato grower from Narayangaon near Pune, said that the adverse weather condition impacted the plantation badly and the tomatoes are not up to the standard. “There are very few growers who are able to reap good returns from the present market rates,” he said.

---||Goa||Goa not a political colony for ‘invaders’, says Congress||PANAJI: In an indirect reference to Aam Aadmi Party and All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), Congress on Thursday said Goa is not a “political colony” that can be governed by “invaders” from Delhi or West Bengal.  Senior Congress functionaries said AAP’s and TMC’s entry into Goa’s turbulent political waters will not hamper the party’s chances in the 2022 assembly elections. Former Union finance minister and senior AICC election observer and strategist for Goa, P Chidambaram, said that after lengthy preparations and planning for the coming assembly polls, it was time for party functionaries and workers to put the plan into action and work at the grassroots level. “Goa will be governed by Goans. Goa is not a colony to be colonised by some political party. It cannot become a political colony of any invader,” said Chidambaram after opening the party’s election campaign office at Patto, Panaji. State opposition leader Digambar Kamat and state Congress president Girish Chodankar voiced the same sentiment as they exhorted party workers to work unitedly for the coming elections. “Goans have decided that the reins of Goa have to remain in the hands of Goans, not the Delhi people or the Bengal people. They can come and offer whatever they want, Goans will not sell their pride and self-respect,” Kamat said. Ironically, Congress also suffers from a ‘high command’ structure, with all the decision-making concentrated with the Gandhi family. Right from the selection of candidates to deciding the election strategy and on poll alliances, all decisions are taken by AICC in Delhi, political watchers pointed out. Chodankar insisted that the political parties encroaching into Congress’ turf are doing so at the behest of BJP. “There are new political parties coming into Goa and the BJP chief minister is very happy to see this. Another 10 parties can come to Goa, but the Goan voter will not fall prey to them,” he further said. Meanwhile, Chidambaram has urged party workers to remind the voters of the ‘golden age’ of Goa’s growth witnessed when Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane was chief minister. “We have spent enough time planning, now it is time to go out into the field and move forward to fight at the elections. In 2017, you (party workers) won Goa, but the legislators lost it, and then in 2019, we lost Delhi. This time we will win Goa in 2022 and we will win Delhi in 2024,” said Chidambaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-not-a-political-colony-for-invaders-says-congress/articleshow/87031787.cms||---

The victim also alleged that the offenders stole her valuables. Police have registered a gang-rape case and launched a manhunt to nab the offenders. The survivor, a resident of Puranapul in the Old City, has been working at a private organisation in Mehdipatnam as a security guard. Around 5.30pm on Wednesday, she went to a toddy compound at Attapur from her house to purchase toddy, Rajendranagar inspector K Kanakaiah said. While the victim was about to enter the toddy compound, an auto driver, who was consuming toddy along with two other men, stopped her and offered to purchase toddy for her. After buying toddy, the trio offered to take her to a better place where they can sit and consume toddy without any disturbance, an investigator from Rajendranagar police station said. The woman accompanied the accused in their auto and they took her to an isolated place near Himayatsagar. “The accused and the security guard consumed toddy. When she was in intoxicated condition, the accused raped her and also stole her valuables. After the assault, the accused left her at the spot and fled from there,” police said. The woman, who became dizzy and unconscious, regained her senses around 9.45pm and with the help of locals, called police.

Based on the complaint, police registered a case under Section 376-D and 392 of the IPC. The CCTV footage analysis revealed the registration number of the auto belonging to a person from Kukatpally. Based on the information available, three special teams have launched a manhunt to nab the offenders. The victim was sent for medical examination.

The city has already started experiencing hot and dry days with the mercury levels rising above normal temperatures. On Thursday, the city recorded maximum temperature of 32.6 degree Celsius and minimum temperature of 21 degree Celsius. The relative humidity has also dropped to 53 per cent. With the withdrawal line passing through Hanamkonda, meteorologists predict that the southwest monsoon will withdraw completely from Telangana by the weekend. “The southwest monsoon has already withdrawn from majority parts of Telangana. Withdrawal from remaining parts of the state is expected during the weekend,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad. Although the monsoon will withdraw completely over the next few days, the state may experience some isolated and scattered thundershowers on October 16 and October 17 following a cyclonic circulation forming over east central Bay of Bengal. The coastal parts of West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh are set to witness moderate showers in the next 24 hours. The rain belt will eventually cover Telangana among other states and regions such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha. “The spread and intensity of weather activity will increase, specially over Kerala, south interior Karnataka, Telangana, Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh between October 16 and October 18,” read a weather report issued by Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-may-get-some-more-rain-before-monsoon-bids-adieu-this-week/articleshow/87028466.cms||---

While as many as 343 villages in the district have achieved 100% first dose mark. “Total 7.95 lakh people have been inoculated with the first dose while 3.24 lakh people are fully vaccinated in the district,” Arun Roy, chief district health officer, said. Many parts of the Gir Somnath district, home to Asiatic lions, are remote areas surrounded by forest. Apart from access to the far-flung areas, the vaccine hesitancy among the locals too proved an impediment in the vaccine drive. The district administration organized various programs to drive away vaccine hesitancy so as to ensure maximum participation in the drive. The senior officials including collector and district development officer organized ‘Ratri Sabha’ in various villages to convince people to take the jabs. The district administration used public address systems of religious places, like mosques, to spread awareness about the vaccination drive and also bust rumours about the jabs. The health teams visited cattle breeders in the villages of Gir sanctuary area using mobile vans and also administered vaccines at their doorsteps. The health team also visited boats at Veraval port to administer doses to fishermen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/80-of-adult-population-administered-first-vaccine-dose/articleshow/87028498.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi thana gets a fix on seized note storage: Bank deposits||NEW DELHI: Moving away from the tradition of keeping seized or recovered currency notes in the malkhana (store room) of police stations, the South-West district will soon become the first to start depositing such money in a bank in the form of fixed deposits. The move came after Paras Nath Verma, station house officer, Palam village, began a new tradition by depositing Rs 96,340 in a fixed deposit in a bank. This amount had been seized during a raid on a gambling den in 2019. Verma said the concept of depositing confiscated cash in banks came in 2012 when he was posted at Neb Sarai police station. In a case registered there, Rs 35 lakh was seized from a man who illegally lent money to people on interest. The man moved court for the release of the money, but his plea was rejected since it constituted money with unaccounted origins. “It was a large sum of money and keeping it at the malkhana could not only open it to risk of being stolen but also the notes being damaged,” said Verma. “Police, therefore, requested the court to allow them to put it in a bank deposit. The court accepted the plea and in 2012, the fixed deposit was created. In its order, the court appreciated the efforts of the cops, saying, “This court is duty bound to appreciate the rationale behind such an application.” As to who would get the interest the sum earned, the court said it could be considered at the time of the release of the money. When Nath took over as SHO of Palam, he decided to implement the same system there. Initially, the regular courts weren’t open due to Covid and the measure couldn’t be started. Now that the first step has been taken, the police station will get around 50 FD accounts opened to manage the Rs 8 lakh in the malkhana. The FD accounts are opened in the name of the police station, and a number allotted to every case property alongside the FIR number. In the earlier days, seized currency notes were put in a bundle in a cupboard. When such seized money was stolen from the Karol Bagh police station, the then police commissioner ordered all police stations to install a safe in the malkhana. Gaurav Sharma, DCP (South-West), said, “We will implement this practical scheme of depositing seized money in the bank across the district. This is the best and the safest way to keep all seized cash.” In 2018, Delhi Police introduced the concept of e-malkhana and even government properties in the malkhanas were digitalised for the first time in the capital. Data of all the records of government properties, details to whom the property was originally issued, etc, were digitally maintained. The biometric details of the person eligible to receive the case property once the case was resolved was also maintained along with the photograph and other records of such a person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/thana-gets-a-fix-on-seized-note-storage-bank-deposits/articleshow/87030489.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Actor Armaan Kohli denied bail in drugs case by special NDPS court||MUMBAI: A special NDPS court on Thursday denied bail to actor Armaan Kohli arrested in a drugs case filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) of seizure of 1.3gm of cocaine, a small quantity. The court also rejected the bail pleas of two co-accused from whom no recovery was made. The NCB has booked them for illicit trafficking, abetment and conspiracy and the case can’t be dissected for each individual’s role as the crime is all part of the same thread, for the purposes of bail, special public prosecutor Advait Sethna had argued. Kohli had argued for bail on the grounds that no case of illicit trafficking is made out and only a small quantity was alleged to be recovered. But the NCB said the bail plea is “misconceived” and had been rejected by the magistrate on September 4. “Illicit drug trafficking is evident from material on record and the nexus with other co-accused from whom commercial quantity is recovered,” the NCB said, adding that Kohli’s role in “is apparent considering the nexus with …(a co-accused) who is a big-time peddler having criminal antecedents”. From that accused, NCB said on July 28, it had seized an intermediate quantity of mephedrone. It argued that Kohli’s case could not be considered in isolation. The actor was arrested on August 28 under the NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-actor-armaan-denied-bail-in-drugs-case-by-spl-court/articleshow/87030594.cms||Swati Deshpande

The BOA grants permission to activities proposed by an entity starting operations in a special economic zone (SEZ). The Reliance unit is in the Mihan-SeZ here. It has plans to start a second unit to make small arms. The BoA approval is, however, subject to a green signal by the ministry of defence which will be scrutinizing the security aspects before approving the plant. This was confirmed by the development commissioner of Mihan-SEZ Sraman Vasireddy. He was also part of the BOA meeting held last week. Vasireddy said the ministry of defence would ascertain whether the security protocol is in line with the defence norms. “After that a final approval would be granted,” he said. Certain steps like completion of boundary wall for the SEZ also need to be taken. At present, there is a gap of around 2 km in the wall demarcating the SEZ area of Mihan from the domestic tariff area (DTA). The SEZ needs to be properly demarcated from the rest of the area through a boundary. The work is expected to be taken up soon along with that of the the customs clearance zone which was pending since a number of years. The boundary wall is also one of the security requirement. In another meeting, a proposal of setting up free trade warehousing zones in Mihan was also taken up. Here traders can keep the goods which can be exported or removed for sale in the domestic market. Vasireddy said a NGO has also come come up with a proposal to beautify the Telhara lake. The NGO plans to plant trees around the lake within the SEZ. The lake, spread in around 100 acres, is surrounded by land allotted to erstwhile Satyam Computers now Tech Mahindra. In another development, the ground breaking ceremony of the proposed ‘engine hospital’ MRO by Kalpana Saroj Global Aviation has been planned on Sunday. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kamani Tubes Limited headed by Kalpana Saroj. The company has plans to come up with an engine bay where aircraft engine can be maintained. It has been allotted one acre of land in the Mihan-SEZ.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/boa-grants-ind-licence-to-reliances-night-vision-unit/articleshow/87028549.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Delhi||Delhi: Find vacant parking slot, pay fee via SDMC app||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday launched its smart parking mobile app and smart card for payment of parking fees at all its surface and multi-level parking lots. The facility is likely to start at four-five parking lots by this weekend. The system aims to help people track locations, find vacant spaces at each parking lot, pay money online and use the SDMC smart card for payment of parking charges. Officials said that the entire system would be monitored to check overuse of parking space and overcharging from the users. The app, ‘MyParking’, was launched by union minister Anurag Thakur. The civic body has developed the app in association with Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL). BECIL will also be the implementing agency for the app-based smart parking system. Thakur said that the app would smoothen the process of booking parking slots in advance. “A citizen can check the availability of slots remotely and can even book the same. The app will facilitate cashless and paperless transactions and automatically save several kilograms of paper on a daily basis,” he explained. At present, SDMC is operating 145 surface parking sites, six multi-level parking sites and two automated parking sites. This app will provide information about total capacity of vehicles to be parked in the SDMC parking lots, space used for parking and space available for parking at each site in real time. “Besides bearing the cost of developing the app, BECIL will also maintain it and bear the cost of the server. Since there has been a demand from users for cashless mode of payment, it became even more pertinent for us to develop the facility,” said SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan. This app will eventually be integrated with Vahan app, FasTag, e-challan and other government initiatives, as per requirement, said SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti. BECIL will also run a dedicated call centre. “The call centre will handle complaints related to the app, which will be available for free to download on android & IOS platforms. By this weekend, we will start the facility at four-five parking lots, possibly at Greater Kailash 1&2, South Extension, etc.,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, project and remunerative cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/find-vacant-parking-slot-pay-fee-via-sdmc-app/articleshow/87030585.cms||---

While Russia has never invited India for the extended troika meetings on Afghanistan apparently because India doesn’t have much influence with the Taliban, it sees India as an important partner in the Moscow Format, which includes 11 countries, for forging a regional consensus on Afghanistan. The MEA spokesperson said India will participate at the joint secretary level in what will be the first Moscow Format meeting since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. India had its first official engagement with the Taliban on August 31 when Indian ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal met then deputy head of Taliban’s political office in Doha Mohammad Stanekzai. Russia has said that the Moscow Format talks will emphasise before a Taliban delegation on the need for a more inclusive government in Afghanistan. Before the Moscow Format though, the extended or expanded troika, which includes US, Russia, China and Pakistan, will have another meeting. While Indian leaders have repeatedly said India’s main concern in Pakistan is terrorism, PM Narendra Modi has himself also said that the government in Afghanistan is not inclusive in its present form. The Moscow Format was set up in 2017 on the basis of a then six-party consultation mechanism involving Russia, Afghanistan, India, Iran, China and Pakistan. Even in 2018, when Russia had invited Taliban for the Moscow Format meeting, India had participated at a ``non-official level’’ by sending veteran diplomats Amar Sinha and T C A Raghavan to the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-attend-moscow-talks-on-afghanistan-involving-taliban/articleshow/87033270.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat HC admits PIL seeking halt to use of coal||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday admitted a PIL seeking directions to the authorities to order industries to shift from using coal as fuel to gas, to curb air pollution in the state. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said that this was important litigation and decided to hear it further on October 29. Petitioner advocate Amit Panchal submitted that shifting to gas as fuel is preferred because the burning of coal leads to air pollution in a significant manner. Compared to coal, PNG/CNG is a clean fuel and results in little or no pollution. There are several states which have mandated the use of gas instead of coal in industrial units. The governments are duty-bound to provide clean air to their citizens and they have got the power to mandate use of gas to run industries under the provisions of the Air Act. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had responded to this PIL by submitting that it has a plan in place to reduce air pollution. The plan was prepared after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) placed Gujarat’s major cities in the list of total 102 ‘non-attainment cities’. There are industrial clusters where the pollution levels were beyond permissible limits, the petitioner added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hc-admits-pil-seeking-halt-to-use-of-coal/articleshow/87027921.cms||---
---||Agra||UP: ‘Rail roko’ on October 18 if Union minister Ajay Mishra is not sacked, say farmers||AGRA: For six hours on October 18, farmers in “every district” will be out on railway tracks, staging a blockade in protest against “no action” being taken against Union minister Ajay Mishra in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, farmer leaders under the aegis of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Thursday. The minister has been accused of criminal conspiracy by farmers and his son has been arrested after being booked for killing four farmers and a journalist. “Between 10am and 4pm on Monday, protesters will stop trains across the country,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said at a private event in Aligarh on Thursday. Asked about the plan, Tikait told TOI, “Farmers from every district will stage blockades on their nearest rail lines. Minister Mishra has been accused of criminal conspiracy but he has not been summoned, nor has he been asked to step down. His son was arrested, but after a lot of delay. We won’t get justice if he remains in office. So, unless he is sacked, we are going ahead with our rail roko.” On October 3, farmers at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri were preparing for a black flag protest against minister Ajay Mishra and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya when Mishra’s convoy allegedly ran over protesters, killing four farmers and a journalist. The violence escalated and two BJP workers and a driver were also killed, allegedly by protesters. Farmers have further alleged that the killings were “planned” while Mishra has maintained that it was an “accident” that followed “protesters pelting stones at the convoy”. Preparations for the rail roko have begun. “In Punjab, we have identified 36 points for our blockade. We will make sure no train from any state passes through these points,” said Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda) in Punjab and working member of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. In UP’s Mathura, hundreds have been asked to turn up at each station. “About 600 people have been asked to gather at Raya station and nearly 400 at Mathura junction to stop trains. This was decided at a district-level meeting on Wednesday,” said Raj Kumar Tomar, district president of BKU (Ambavata) in Mathura. “Police have deployed PAC outside villages. We think it’s with the protest in mind.” The finer details of the plan for Monday’s rail roko will be drawn out on Friday. “We will decide on the details tomorrow (Friday). Our intention is to convey to the government that the agitation will continue until the minister is removed,” Harvinder Singh, president of BKU’s Uttarakhand youth unit, told TOI.

The court said the rigour of POCSO law was being “misapplied” and “misused” and granted bail to a 21-year-old man accused of raping a minor girl with whom he claimed to be in a relationship. The court said it could not ignore the friendship between the two and added that it appeared the FIR was lodged at the insistence of the girl’s family which was embarrassed on finding out that she was pregnant. “Consensual sex has been in legal grey area because the consent given by minor cannot be said to be a valid consent in the eyes of law. The short question which arises is as to whether the petitioner (man) should be granted bail or not. ...Whereas, what has become a trite and unfortunate practice is that the police are filing POCSO cases at the behest of the family of a girl who object to her friendship and romantic involvement with a young boy. The rigour of the law is, therefore, being misapplied and subsequently misused,” Justice Subramonium Prasad observed. The court said the age of man and girl, photographs that categorically pointed towards a relationship between the two and discrepancies in the statements given at the time of recordings of medical report, FIR and before the magistrate are all mitigating factors that tilt the balance towards grant of bail to the accused. It said, it appeared that to avoid social embarrassment and to get the pregnancy medically terminated, this FIR has been filed giving it a colour of sexual exploitation and bringing it in the ambit of the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act which envisages abolition of child abuse. The court, which noted that the girl had no objection to grant of bail to the man, said they both were more or less of the same age and this fact cannot be overlooked that the accused was only 21-year-old, having a complete life ahead of him. The court directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount and not to leave the district of Hardoi unless for appearing in court proceedings. According to the FIR, the girl complained that she was 16 years of age and a student of Class XII and in January last year, the man allegedly sexually assaulted her when she was returning from a friend’s place. The man, while seeking bail, submitted that he had developed friendship with the girl in school and while the girl was 18-year-old, he was 21-year-old. The complainant has been coerced by her family members to file the FIR, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rigour-of-pocso-law-being-misused-hc-gives-bail/articleshow/87030618.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

These two roads having numerous potholes and bad surface layer have again missed out on repair works by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). In a dubious record, these two well-known and heavily used roads have not been asphalted completely for over 20 years. The civic officials confirmed to TOI that these two roads are not part of the 17 major roads selected for total tarring and repairing works. “They were part of cement concrete road project phase-I. Road from Sawarkar Nagar Square (also known as Khamla Cchowk or Orange City Hospital Chowk) to Ajni Square will have to be dropped from phase-I. We will submit proposal for total asphalting of the road to the standing committee for administrative approval. Road from Mokshadham Square to ST Bus stand square will remain in phase-I,” they said. The officials added tendering process of remaining roads under phase-I will be done in the coming days. Orange City Hospital and Research Institute is located off Sawarkar Nagar Square to Ajni Square road. Its director Dr Anup Marar told TOI that in the last 20 years, he has never seen the NMC tarring the road. “The road is in bad condition for years now and causing serious inconvenience to citizens,” he said. The road has a large number of craters and the surface layer on both sides is damaged for almost the entire stretch. The NMC carries out patch works whenever receives complaints from the people. The road was part of phase-I implemented in June 2011 but not concretized. Contractor Unity Infraprojects Private Limited cited water pipeline below the road for the inordinate delay. In February 2019, the contractor exited the project. Few more stretches like the one side of Lokmat Square to Kalpana Building Square on Central Bazaar Road, Ram Nagar Square to Laxmi Bhuvan Square, Medical Chowk to Krida Square, Morris College T-Point to Manas Square etc will remain pothole-riddled for around next six or more months. The tendering process, followed by work order and commencement of work on site for phase-I is likely to take six or more months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-tarred-for-20-years-two-major-roads-with-craters-again-miss-out/articleshow/87028592.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aryan Khan moved to general cell in Arthur Road jail, has a mobile video call with parents||MUMBAI: Ten days after his arrest in a drug case, actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan spoke to his parents for the first time from the Arthur Road jail through a mobile video call. The call took place either on Tuesday or Wednesday, sources said. The call facility was introduced by jail authorities during the pandemic last year for inmates to communicate with their families and lawyers. Aryan was sent to Arthur Road jail after an NDPS court sent him to judicial custody last week. “Aryan gave his mother’s number. He spoke to his mother and father through the video call facility for 10 minutes,” confirmed a senior jail official. As per norms, undertrials can talk to their family/lawyers twice or thrice a month in the presence of jail constables. At present, Arthur Road has 11 smartphone handsets. In another development, Aryan and six others, all arrested in the same drug case by NCB, have been shifted from the jail’s quarantine cell. “All inmates, who were kept in the quarantine cell, have been shifted to general cells,” said a jail officer. Last week, Aryan and others were kept in a quarantine cell as per the rule. An inmate brought to the jail is first kept at the quarantine cell for three to five days and is transferred to a regular cell once his Covid test result is negative. Aryan and other accused have been allotted undertrial number (qaidi number) , and Aryan’s number begins with ‘N’, which is alloted to inmates in NDPS cases. There were also reports that Aryan had got some money from his family via money order, which he can use to buy things from the jail canteen. An undertrial gets coupons after his family sends him money; only coupons are accepted at the jail canteen. In June last year, the state prison department had stopped physical meetings (mulaqat) of prisoners with family members and lawyers due to the pandemic and introduced the video calling facility instead. As a result, 55 smartphones in over three dozen jails were installed at that time. The facility has helped many prisoners, said a jail officer, adding that an inmate gets to talk to his family face-to-face via video call. “It is time- and cost-effective,” a jail official had earlier said. Jail departments had during the pandemic created dedicated email IDs for each prison. A lawyer can visit the website www.mahaprisons.gov.in and send an e-mail to the concerned jail authorities, if he/she wants to communicate with his/her client. An email may contain an inmate’s name, cell or barrack number, court case number etc. Once the jail authorities sanction the e-meeting, a time slot is allotted to a lawyer as when s/he can communicate to the client for a maximum of 10 to 15 minutes. Prior to introducing this call facility, a lawyer or family members would have to come to the jail, get themselves registered in the mulaqat register and then they would be able to meet an inmate. The Arthur Road jail may start the physical mulaqat of inmates with their relatives from next week as the collector has given the go-ahead, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/aryan-moved-to-general-cell-in-jail-has-a-mobile-video-call-with-parents/articleshow/87030628.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Law has taken its course, says Sanjay Raut on Jitendra Awhad arrest||MUMBAI: NCP minister Jitendra Awhad was arrested and released on bail on Thursday. In April 2020, Karmuse, a resident of Ghodbunder Road, had complained to Thane police that he was abducted and assaulted on April 5. After PM Modi had asked citizens to light lamps to show their collective resolve against Covid-19, Karmuse said he had posted a morphed picture of Awhad’s face on Facebook. Karmuse alleged that two constables and two others in police uniform and some others then came to his building at around 11.50 pm on a Sunday night and told him he should come to the ‘police station’ for questioning. When Karmuse asked what case it was about, they refused to divulge details. The cops took him to Awhad’s bungalow, where he was attacked allegedly in the presence of policemen and the minister, he alleged. Karmuse was later admitted to hospital where he was treated for bruises on back, a fractured finger and given stitches While BJP’s Kirit Somaiya on Thursday demanded Awhad’s dismissal, the minister said, ““I do not respond to Somaiya, I have full faith in the judiciary, the law will take its own course.” Sena MP Sanjay Raut said in Awhad’s case, the law had taken its own course. “His arrest is as per provisions of law, and this shows there is rule of law in Maharashtra and the law is applied to all,” Raut said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said if BJP was insisting on dismissal of Awhad, it should first sack Narayan Rane, who too was arrested and released on bail. “Awhad is a law-abiding citizen. Following an FIR, he was arrested and produced before the magistrate. He has been released on bail. We should wait till filing of chargesheet and wait for the outcome of the case. I am sure Awhad will come out clean,” Malik said. Awhad was produced before magistrate D Kolapkar at around 4 pm, said lawyer Gajanan Chavan who represented him. DCP Vinay Rathod, said, “Vartak Nagar police recorded his statement and he was produced in Thane court. The magistrate released him on bail on a bail bond of Rs 10,000 cash and one surety.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/law-has-taken-its-course-says-raut-on-awhad-arrest-in-mumbai/articleshow/87032215.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Talking with TOI, Pracharak Sanyojak of the organizing committee, Amit Bhardwaj, said a lot of preparations are required for the Dussehra celebrations, which is preceded by a 21-day Ramleela programme. Besides , it takes time to make the effigies. With the administration delaying the permission, it is too late to have proper celebrations this year, he added. “We usually took the permission a week before the commencement of the season but due to Covid restrictions, we had applied in advance -- almost a month ago -- to avoid wastage of time, money and resources,” Bhardwaj said, adding that thanks to the administration's indecisiveness, Dussehra celebrations will remain a subdued affair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/low-key-dussehra-in-mathura-due-to-delay-in-permissions/articleshow/87028629.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB does not know difference between tobacco & ganja, says Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: A day after a special court under the NDPS Act granted bail to his son-in-law Sameer Khan, NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Thursday sharpened his attack against the Narcotics Control Bureau, saying it does not know the difference between tobacco and ganja (cannabis). Khan had been arrested on January 14. The court order was made available on Wednesday. “The special court said the quantum of contraband seized as per the chemical analysis report was not commercial quantity and charges of abetment and conspiracy made out by NCB do not apply,” Malik said. “I have carefully read the brief order of the special court. It has raised a question mark over the action taken by NCB,” he added. Malik alleged that on January 14, there were reports on several television channels saying a huge quantity of ganja had been seized from the residence of his son-in-law. “Nothing was found, and selective information was given to the media to defame my son-in-law. Even pictures released by the NCB were not from the spot but from the chamber of the NCB’s zonal director. Not only my son-in-law, but even Rahil Furniturewala and Karan Sajnani were framed. Same was the case with Rhea Chakraborty,” he claimed. Malik said his family was under trauma ever since the arrest of his son-in-law, and they were aware he had been framed. “The NCB released false information on the raid on Khan’s house. A high-ranking NCB official sent WhatsApp messages and pictures of Khan to the media on the seizure of 200 kg ganja. The episode was planned to defame me and my family,” Malik alleged. Ever since the NCB raided a cruise ship on October 2 and arrested Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, Malik has launched a campaign against the NCB, saying most of its raids are fake and aimed at defaming the MVA government and Bollywood. Malik said the main witness in the raid was a criminal who was currently absconding, and NCP president Sharad Pawar endorsed Malik’s allegations. Meanwhile, home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Thursday stepped up security cover provided to Malik in view of threats received by him. He has been provided Y-plus category security, which entitles him to an escort and round-the clock security at his residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-does-not-know-difference-between-tobacco-ganja-malik/articleshow/87030728.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Double duty for fully vaccinated teachers; 25% await second dose||PUNE: With more than 25% of the teachers in government schools — especially in rural areas — yet to get their second Covid-19 vaccine dose, the burden of teaching their classes has fallen on their fully vaccinated colleagues. The teachers who can report for duty have found themselves juggling their own classes, as well as providing back up for those who are absent. Commissioner of education Vishal Solanki said the vaccination of the pending staff is being undertaken on a priority basis. “There are nearly 80% of the teachers across Maharashtra who have received their first dose. We are vaccinated the rest on priority and ensuring that all teachers receive both doses.” Bhor taluka zilla parishad teacher Dhananjay Kate in his school, just three teachers are managing all classes. “The other two teachers have yet to join us as they haven’t gotten their second dose; till they do, we are conducting the classes on their behalf,” Kate said. Vidyadhar Shimpi, a teacher from a municipal school in Lohegaon, said they can manage in the interim as the number of students back at school is low. “However, after Dasara, from next week, we expected attendance to improve. That will be the real challenge,” Shimpi said. The state government had prioritised the vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff from September 1. Close to 20 lakh teachers and non-teaching staffers including administrators, clerks, peons, and drivers working in government as well as private schools across the state were eligible for free vaccination. School reopened for Class V and upwards in rural areas, and Class VIII and above in urban areas, on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/double-duty-for-fully-vaxxed-teachers-25-await-2nd-dose/articleshow/87028636.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

In a meeting with tourism officials on Thursday, chief secretary S S Sandhu directed the department to provide wristbands for mountaineers and trekkers so their location can be traced during search operations. Sandhu added that other necessary arrangements should also be made for their safety. This comes just days after members of a Navy expedition team had gone missing on Mt Trishul. Four bodies were later retrieved. Many trekkers have gone missing in remote terrains in the past. Sandhu added that Char Dham yatra provides seasonal tourism, but there is wide scope for off-season tourism as well. “It is important to work on connectivity too. Work should be done at the earliest on the construction of helipads and heliports,” he said. The senior state officer said priority should be given to those areas where tourism has potential for development, but which are lagging behind due to connectivity. He said the facilities of water and toilets should be made available every 30km on travel routes for the convenience of travellers and the general public. The chief secretary also said an app and website should be prepared to provide tourism-related information to youngsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-provide-gps-wristbands-to-trekkers/articleshow/87026984.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Popping aspirin for fear of heart attacks may dig up bigger internal bleeding issues||NEW DELHI: You shouldn’t take aspirin — a blood thinning medicine — daily to prevent heart attacks or strokes, just because you’re 60 years or older, a US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended. Daily aspirin use may help prevent heart attacks and strokes in some people, but, according to John B Wong, who is a member of the task force, it can also cause potentially serious issues, such as internal bleeding. Dr Devi Shetty, noted cardiac surgeon and chairman of Narayana Health, told TOI that the recommendations should serve as a warning to many people in India who take the drug just because they are above 60 years. “I have seen patients who take aspirin daily without a doctor’s advice. This is dangerous,” he said. Daily low-dose aspirin makes the blood less sticky and helps to prevent heart attacks and stroke. Dr Ashok Seth, chairman of Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI), said many heart patients were perturbed after learning about the side effects of the drug. “It is important for those people who have had a heart attack or stroke in the past, those who have undergone angioplasty or bypass surgery and others who are already on daily aspirin need not discontinue the therapy. In their case, the benefits of the drug far outweigh the risks,” he said. According to Dr Sundeep Mishra, professor of cardiology at AIIMS, in a healthy person, there is no benefit of using aspirin, because any purported benefit of reducing heart risk will be lost by the increased risk of bleeding, and thus there’s no overall benefit at all. “For example, if the risk of heart attack is high in a person, especially someone who has had it before or has angina, the risk of more heart attacks is very high, and thus there is a benefit of using aspirin in that case. On the other hand, a healthy person with a low risk of heart disease has no benefit from aspirin, as the risk of bleeding is higher than the benefit. The third scenario is that of a person who has no heart disease now but has multiple risk factors for developing heart diseases like diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, high bad cholesterol or is overweight with low physical activity. Here, the decision to give aspirin or not give has to be individualised,” he said. The US Task Force has also suggested that people who are 40 to 59 years old and don’t have a history of heart disease have a conversation with their clinician to decide if starting to take aspirin is right for them. Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc, said the task force recommendations are based on evidence generated in the US. “Indians have a much higher risk. This is particularly true for patients with diabetes. So, while there is a small chance of bleeding, many high-risk patients, especially long-standing diabetes patients, may benefit from aspirin,” he said. Coronary artery disease or damage in the heart’s blood vessels occurs a decade earlier and is more severe in the Indian population as compared to the western population, Dr Mohit Gupta, professor of cardiology at G B Pant hospital, said. “It is important to send across the message that irrational use of aspirin for preventing heart attacks in people above 60 years without multiple risk factors must be avoided,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/popping-aspirin-for-fear-of-heart-attacks-may-dig-up-bigger-internal-bleeding-issues/articleshow/87030686.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

This UAV has completed over 30 test flights over the course of a week, passing various parameters such as maximum range, endurance, waypoint navigation, and return-to-launch capabilities, it said. T-Works designed and fabricated the airframe and its components using software design tools, 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC routing machines. A winged aircraft consumes up to 75% less power than a conventional multi-rotor since the wings help produce the additional buoyant force, as a result of which it can carry much heavier payloads over much larger distances. Sujai Karampuri, CEO T-Works, said “The best battery powered multi-rotors in the world are limited to a 40km range while the most common and affordable ones are limited to around 20-25km after which the battery must be recharged or replaced. For wider applications and to cover longer distances, say over 100km, with speed, we must break this range barrier. Here, fixed-wing VTOL UAVs are an efficient option.” Apart from medical supplies delivery, the UAV can be used for surveying, inspection, defence applications, surveillance, and as a testbed for experimental payloads. The next version of this UAV will have a range of 100km with a payload capacity of 3.5kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/t-works-built-autonomous-hybrid-uav-covers-45km/articleshow/87028680.cms||---

Earlier, a video of her participating in a garba dance during Navratri festival had emerged. Her sister said her spine problem can give her trouble any time. The video showed Thakur playing kabaddi at a Kali temple on Wednesday. The video of her dancing was at a programme at the same venue during Navratri,, while an earlier clip had shown her shooting hoops on a basketball court. She was in prison for almost nine years and was granted bail in 2017. Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson Narendra Singh Saluja posted the latest videos on Twitter. “It is a matter of happiness to see you healthy. Today, you were seen playing Garba.

---||Pune||Parents allege pressure from mgmts to pay pending fees; oral warnings issued||Pune: Parents of children studying in city schools have said that some of them have received notices from school management to clear the pending fees failing which their wards might be prevented from appearing for the mid-term examination. Some claimed to have received school notices, with instalment option as loan from financial companies. Quite a few parents alleged that students of classes 5 to 7 have been called to school “in an attempt to recover the fees”. The education office said that they have received few complaints from parents, and they have issued oral warnings to a few school managements not to resort to any wrongful means to recover pending dues from students. Some parents stated that their wards were told on the first day of reopening of schools to pay the fees in the next two to three days. Paresh Nathani, a parent, said, “We received a note on the first day of school reopening to pay the fees within a deadline. It was very disappointing to receive the note on the very first day.” Mukund Kirdat, a representative of the AAP Parents’ Union, said, “A lot of parents informed us that some schools had warned or reminded the students about fee payment. The school management must review their decisions regarding such announcements, and their fees recovering tactics. Since the children are back to school after a long time, focus should be on maintaining a healthy environment.” Shiva Kate, whose daughter studies in standard X, said, “I lost my job last year during the lockdown. I had no job for almost 4-5 months. Now, I am back to work at a new place. I have informed the school about my situation and yet they asked my daughter to pay the fees at the earliest.” Education activist Matin Mujawar said “The behaviour of some schools with respect to recovering the fees is unreasonable. The situation is getting back to normal. The schools must give some time to parents and have patience. They should also give concession in fees so that no parent is burdened, and no student is left out of the education system.” Minakshi Raut, education officer, PMC education board, said, “We have received some informal complaints from parents regarding the fee recovery tactics adopted by some schools. However, we have been informing such schools to avoid these methods and give parents some time as schools have reopened only a few days back. The complainants mentioned that schools were giving the option of loans from financial institutions. Teachers were writing notes in school diaries or sending messages to parents regarding clearance of dues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parents-allege-pressure-from-mgmts-to-pay-pending-fees-oral-warnings-issued/articleshow/87028693.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra government cites rising construction & repair costs for fund hike||MUMBAI: The MVA government has issued an order raising the Local Area Development fund for MLAs and MLCs to Rs 4 crore. “We could not give approval to disburse the funds earlier owing to the resource crunch during the pandemic. Even last year, the fund release was delayed,” an official said. TimesViewThe MVA government has hiked the MLA LAD by 100% since it took over. Many feel this has been done with an eye on the series of local body and municipal polls. Although the money does not go to the legislator, he gains popularity by being able to recommend local work in his constituency. Funds available to legislators in other states like Delhi are much higher. The key question remains: How well is the scheme audited and whether the works are of good quality and whether they last.The MLA LAD fund is meant to be used for development work in a legislator’s constituency. MLAs and MLCs do not receive any money under these schemes. The government transfers it directly to the respective local authorities. The legislators can only recommend works in their constituencies based on a set of guidelines. The decision on which project to spend on is taken by the legislator and the funds are disbursed through district collectors. According to the government resolution issued by the planning department, the funds will be used for small works like the construction of school rooms, anganwadi centres, cremation grounds, toilets and bus shelters. Also, Kolhapur-style small dams. The hike became necessary due to the rise in cost of construction material and the need to maintain and repair existing structures, the government resolution says. Activists say the hike in the legislator fund has been undertaken with an eye on the series of local polls later this year and next year. “The state will be facing elections to key municipalities and zilla parishads. Small development works like this help popularise the party with locals,” said an activist. “The increase in the MLA fund is commendable and welcome. However, the caveat is that each MLA should be able to show justifiable and visible developmental improvement across his/her constituency,” said Indrani Malkani, chairman of V Citizens Action Network. “The usage of the fund should address specific requirements, not just routine work,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-cites-rising-construction-repair-costs-for-fund-hike/articleshow/87030785.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Kandolkar and GFP organisational secretary Durgadas Kamat said that the contours of the probable tie-up are still being discussed. “I-PAC approached us. We have not spoken to TMC,” said Kandolkar, adding, “Goa has Shantadurga, who is peaceful but Goa needs Durga of Bengal to send the demon of BJP home. The political situation will be clear by Diwali.” On October 12, TOI had reported that GFP was making overtures towards TMC by promising “a new dawn” and an alternative to BJP and Congress. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that Goa needs “street fighters” to take on BJP, an indirect reference to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Kandolkar confirmed that talks are on and that no decision has been taken. Kandolkar said that GFP is talking to its workers and office bearers to identify the best way to form an alternate political force to take on BJP. “Whether to have an alliance, to merge or to take over the TMC, nothing has been discussed and we will talk to our karyakartas. Our talks are on. People are looking for a new alternative and we feel this could be it,” Kandolkar said. He further blamed Congress for vacillating regarding an alliance and said that GFP can no longer afford to wait for Congress to make up its mind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-decision-on-alliance-with-tmc-in-15-days/articleshow/87031894.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: At Hiware Bazar’s school, classes constant since June||PUNE: Yashwant Vidyalaya in Hiware Bazar village in Ahmednagar has done what no school in the state could achieve in these Covid-19 times. The school could begin physical classes from Std I to Std X from the beginning of the academic year in June, and sustain them without a break even when Covid-19 cases surfaced for a 100 days as of September 25. There are 222 students studying in Stds I to VII and 125 students in Stds VIII to X in the school. The gram panchayat had no permission to start school from either the zilla parishad or the state education department. But the panchyat samiti took it upon itself, and to rest the responsibility on parents too. They put a Covid-19 prevention system in place, and started school after assurances to students and parents. The school had its share of Covid cases during this period which were effectively managed by the gram panchayat without disturbing the routine. These good practices are now a model, and the state education department made special mention of the success story on October 4 when schools reopened across Maharashtra for higher classes. Sarpanch Popatrao Pawar said that a symptomatic child reported by the school was handled by a panchayat member appointed who would alert the front line workers of the village immediately and the gram panchayat. “Designated people would spring into action and conduct the required procedure for the student that included testing and treatment. At the same time, the other students would also be tested for the infection and quarantine, if necessary. Parents showed immense support during this period, and hence, we had a successful model,” he added. The gram panchayat conducted a survey among villagers from April 2 to April 15 on restarting physical schools. They found that the students were happy with the thought, but their parents were hesitant. Secondary school teacher Deepak Thange said that the gram panchayat constituted a six-member team, including panchayat members and some parents, to conduct a door-to-door monitoring of houses, and symptomatic villagers were reported to the health department immediately. “Between April 15 and April 30, the village became free of Covid-19 and then the gram panchayat along with the teachers convinced the parents that if each one took the responsibility without any fear of the virus, only then could the gram panchayat resume classes. The parents agreed and from June 15, Hiware Bazar’s Yashwant Vidyalaya was buzzing with students from Standards VIII, IX and X, followed by students from V, VI and VII in the next four days and in the following four days the students of Standards I to IV also joined,” he added. Primary school teacher, Shobha Pawar, said, “During this period, a student had gone for a trip to Bhandardara with his parents and tested positive when he came back. Quick action was taken by the health workers as well as the gram panchayat, to treat the student. Other students in the class were also tested and the case management was handled well. Not a single day of class was interrupted. We continued with our routine.” On another occasion, a student participated in a family get together and tested positive. The sarpanch then met all the students and asked them if they again wanted to stay home or attend physical classes. “The students did not realise that socialising would hamper the school model. So, they unanimously said they wanted to attend school and would refrain from any socialising activity,” Pawar added. They were advised to keep away from weddings, get-togethers, vacations or pot luck parties. They followed the instructions judiciously. Over time, if a student tested positive, the antigen test of other children was also done and those who had a positive result would be referred immediately to the health centre. So far, the school has had less than five cases. The gram panchayat is now trying to replicate the same model in ten other surrounding villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-hiware-bazars-school-classes-constant-since-june/articleshow/87028683.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

MM Salunkhe, vice-chancellor of Bharati Vidyapeeth, said, “We have already sanitised our buildings. We are expecting and appealing to students to come for at least subjects that have practical content because there is very little time left to cover everything. Especially, the final year students need to join physical classes from the first day itself because when they join the industry, they would need hands-on experience. We are planning to give maximum to time to them. The final year is very important because we need to provide them with all kinds of training for making them employable.” A principal of a private engineering college who did not wish to be named said that the Lohegaon airport runway closure coupled with the Dasara-Diwali holiday season will impact students coming this month. “Most of our students are from outside Pune and even outside the state. They have to travel long distances for which they need to book tickets in advance. Getting train tickets now may not be possible. Then they have to get their staying arrangement in place. The airport will not be working for 15 days and then there is Diwali when students would again want to travel back. Taking all these things into consideration, we are reviewing our decision to reopen this month-end.” Vidya Yeravdekar, pro-chancellor of Symbiosis International University, said that they plan to create a bubble for vaccinated students such that once they come to the premises, they stay within the campus. “Before coming here, they need to get their RTPCR test done so we can have two or three students in a large room. Everything a student needs is available on campus including a healthcare facility. Since the students will be inside this safe atmosphere, their parents will also have nothing to worry about,” she added. Prabhat Ranjan, the vice-chancellor of DY Patil International University, Akurdi, said that they are already in touch with a number of hostels in and around the campus and they would be sharing the information with students. “In addition, some good private hostels have come up in the vicinity and we have been using them to satisfaction. They are costlier but some students may prefer them. For some time, lectures would continue to be online but practicals/projects etc would be on campus. For some classes with a small number of students, who meet the requirements of the government, we would have on-campus classes too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/safety-bubble-to-accommodation-private-institutes-go-the-extra-mile/articleshow/87028717.cms||Ardhra Nair

Hypothetically, if WCL stops production from now on and continues to supply at the current rate, there is enough coal to last for one month, said sources. WCL based in Nagpur is the subsidiary of Coal India Limited. On a daily basis, it is mining 1.5 lakh tonne coal (0.15 MT). The financial year began with an opening stock of 14.84 MT of coal as on April 1. The users, mainly generation companies, were also requested to lift the stock in time. As on October 12, WCL is left with 4.71 MT of already mined coal. Fresh quantity continues to be extracted. The year 2020 was considered to be an aberration as industrial activities had taken a hit due to Covid-induced lockdowns. WCL was left with 11.73 MT coal as on October 2020. The opening stock as on April 2020 was 14.30 MT. If 2019, which was a normal year, is considered, then the leftover stock as on date remains to be higher. On October 12, 2019, WCL was left with 3.17MT coal. This means despite the crisis and higher demand for power, WCL is left with 1.54MT additional coal during the current fiscal as compared to 2019, said sources. Out of the total production, over 80% goes to the power sector, said sources. Even the off-take in the current year is higher than the previous fiscal. Till date, as much as 30.60 MT coal has been lifted from WCL’s mines this fiscal. In 2020, 20.62 MT was lifted and it was over 25 MT on the same date in 2019. Sources said this indicates at enough supplies to at least Mahagenco and other power sector units linked with WCL. Sources say even 2021 has come up as any other year in WCl’s operations. Over 80% of Mahagenco’s requirement comes from WCL. It also gets smaller amounts from other CIL subsidiaries like MCL and SECL in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, respectively. On Thursday evening, the generation by Mahagenco’s coal-fired units stood at 5,960 MW. Mahagenco’s plants have a total capacity of over 13,000 MW. Out of this, over 10,000 MW is thermal power which is generated by burning coal. The private plants were generating over 5,800 MW as on 7:30pm on Thursday. Out of this, 2,800 MW was from Adani Power’s plant at Tiroda in Gondia district. This is much close to is total capacity of 3,300 MW. The company has a power purchase agreement (PPA) of selling 3,085 MW to the state government. The Tiroda plant has been able to maintain its average rate of power generation so far, said a source here. In the normal course, it generates 2,200 to 2,500 MW power. Majority of it goes to the state government. NTPC’s plant at Mouda has a capacity of 2,320 MW. On Thursday it produced over 1,800 MW. It has taken 3.5 MT tonne coal so far, which is 2 lakh tonne less than its quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-high-demand-4-7mt-coal-at-wcl-1-5mt-more-than-oct-2019/articleshow/87028754.cms||Shishir Arya

Terming it to be a fake encounter, family members and community leaders put up a demonstration at the hospital morgue on Thursday and refused to allow the post-mortem despite repeated rounds of dialogue with police officials. Demanding suspension of the four policemen, including SHO (Ratanada) Leelaram, filing of a case of murder against them and investigation by CBI or a retired judge besides compensation and government job to a family member, they gathered at the MDM Hospital morgue in large number. Police commissioner Jose Mohan said that the police have constantly been keeping an eye on the situation and trying its best to mitigate the situation. “But they have not yet agreed for a post-mortem and have given a demand charter including action against the SHO,” he said, adding that talks were in progress. He said that a case had already been registered by the SHO (Ratanada) against the criminals for firing on police and a complaint from the other side has also been accepted, which is also being investigated. It may be noted that Kandara had succumbed to bullet injuries sustained in a retaliatory firing by police, when he, along with three others gave a long chase to the police and fired at police vehicle. Three of his accomplices had also been arrested by the police, who seized their vehicle and recovered a firearm from them, which had been used for firing at police. With the spreading of the news of death of Kandara, family members and community people had started gathering at the MDM morgue terming it to be a murder by the police. Many community leaders including former chairman of safai commission, Chandraprakash had termed it to be a purposeful attack on a Dalit and termed Kandara a petty criminal, who according to him should have been caught alive. Expressing solidarity with Kandara, all the sanitation workers of the city had declared ‘Jhadu Down” strike, refusing to carry out sanitation work in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/kin-demands-cbi-probe-into-death-of-criminal-in-jodhpur/articleshow/87030788.cms||---

Unlike the onset of monsoon over the city on June 9 this year, which was two days before its official onset date, the withdrawal was delayed. The official date for withdrawal of monsoon over Mumbai was October 10. As of Thursday, the withdrawal line continued to persist over Vengurla, IMD scientist Shubhangi Bhute said. With the monsoon officially ending, it is the third year in a row that the city has recorded over 3,000mm of rain (3163.5mm) till September 30 and the seasonal excess for 2021 at 43%. This season the city recorded three extremely heavy rain days — June 9-10 (231.3mm), July 16-17 (253.3mm) and July 18-19 (235mm). IMD’s classification states that extremely heavy rainfall is greater or equal to 204.5mm. Meanwhile, October heat continued to grip the city. On Thursday, the maximum temperature recorded by IMD Colaba observatory was 33.2 degrees, which was 0.1 degree above normal. IMD Santacruz recorded a maximum of 34.8 degrees, which was 1.2 degrees above normal. High humidity levels added to discomfort, with Colaba and Santacruz recording 71% and 63% relative humidity. An IMD official said with the monsoon exiting, the city rising temperatures can be expected till the month-end. The seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai are full, allaying concerns of water cuts. The total stock in the lakes supplying water to the city is 99% of required stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-monsoon-withdraws-over-mum-says-imd/articleshow/87030790.cms||Richa Pinto

Locals who joined the victim in chasing the accused, nabbed him and handed over to police. Pradip Tripathi (35) has committed thefts on railway premises. Harshal Vaidya and his pregnant wife Priyanka had gone to Global City in Virar on Tuesday to attend a puja at Priyanka’s sister’s home. His mother-in-law Prabhavati Mankame (60) joined them on Wednesday. Harshal and Priyanka recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary. The crime spot in VirarAfter dinner, the three reached Virar station around 11pm to return to their Vile Parle home. They were waiting for a train on platform 4, when a man came from behind and snatched the bag held by Harshal, said inspector Vitthal Chowgule. Harshal, a cashier in a restaurant in Mumbai, chased him, with Priyanka and Mankame following. As Harshal chased the accused, he alerted passers-by by raising an alarm. Soon, some men joined Harshal as the accused ran towards a desolate lane, opposite the station. Harshal got hold of Tripathi, who pulled out a knife and stabbed him repeatedly on his chest and abdomen. Tripathi tried to flee but was nabbed by locals. Harshal, who was soaked in blood, was admitted to the nearby Sanjeevani hospital and later moved to Shatabdi hospital in Kandivli, where he died early on Thursday. Police obtained grainy CCTV footage of the incident from the crime spot. The images showed Tripathi, in a white shirt and trousers, fleeing with the bag, even as he was chased by locals. The knife was recovered from him. Police said Tripathi has cases of pick-pocketing against him. He was booked under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 392 (robbery), and has been remanded to police custody by the Vasai court. Police said CCTV footage from Virar station was being obtained and the autopsy report is awaited. The body was handed over to Priyanka and her mother on Thursday noon. Eye-witnesses told police the accused, though bulky, ran at least a km before being caught by Harshal. They told police that neither the victim nor they had expected the accused to pull out a knife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-chases-bag-thief-gets-stabbed-to-death-in-virar/articleshow/87030828.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: CCTV to spy on wife turns against NRI||AHMEDABAD: An NRI from Chicago and his parents installed CCTV cameras in every corner of their house here to keep his wife under constant surveillance. Now, the NRI has been caught on the same cameras beating his wife and the surveillance system has become evidence against him and his parents. This happened in a case involving a 32-year-old woman from Sector 14 in Gandhinagar, who on Thursday filed a complaint of domestic violence against her husband, who works for an IT company in Chicago, and her in-laws. The woman stated that she married the NRI, who has a house in Sector 25 in Gandhinagar, on November 27, 2011, according to the wishes of her family. In November 2014, she gave birth to their first child, a daughter. Her husband and in-laws then began harassing her over the birth of a girl child. Her husband went to Chicago in December 2014 and she stayed with her in-laws in Gandhinagar. She said her husband took her and his parents to Chicago in June 2015, after she pleaded that he take her there too. She said that even in the US, her husband and in-laws used to demand dowry from her parents to buy a new flat in Chicago. In November 2018, she, her daughter and her in-laws returned to Gandhinagar and they began harassing her over petty issues, she alleged in the complaint. “They fixed CCTV cameras in every corner of the house and in my bedroom, so they could keep me under surveillance all the time,” she said in the FIR. She said that her husband also returned from Chicago in March 2019 and after a while she got pregnant again. In December 2019, she delivered another child, a son, but they continued to harass and hit her. She told the cops that they had beaten her everywhere in the house and this was captured on the CCTV cameras installed inside the house. They were confident that she would never go to the police and use the footage which captured their brutality against her, said an officer of Gandhinagar women’s police. Armed with the footage, she approached police and filed a complaint against her husband, who is now in Chicago, and her in-laws, for offences under the Domestic Violence Act, causing hurt and criminal intimidation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cctv-to-spy-on-wife-turns-against-nri/articleshow/87028783.cms||---

Dr Gangakhedkar was former head of epidemiology at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A WHO statement on Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) described him as Dr C G Pandit National Chair at ICMR. Dr Gangakhedkar, a Padma Shri winner in 2020, is a trained pediatrician and public health expert. He worked extensively on HIV/ AIDS and helped positive persons set up the National Coalition of People living with HIV, India. ICMR had sent him to John’s Hopkins University for a Masters in public health, and he was since associated with studying outbreaks and epidemics in the country, including the Nipah outbreak in Kerala. He is the only Indian in SAGO. The statement said “rapid emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlighted the importance of being prepared for future events, to be able to identify novel pathogens early and to address risk factors that contribute to their emergence and spread.’’ Experts said recently there have been increasing high threat pathogens like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Nipah, avian influenza, and the latest being SARS-CoV-2. SAGO will advise WHO on development of a global framework to define and guide studies into origins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens of epidemic and pandemic potential. “There is not only a need for robust surveillance and early actions for rapid detection and mitigation efforts, but a need for robust and systematic processes to establish the study around emergence of these pathogens and routes of transmission from natural reservoirs to humans,’’ it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-indian-in-who-panel-to-study-pandemic-causing-pathogens/articleshow/87032245.cms||---

This finding is the outcome of a genomic analysis of several Indian populations carried out by Dr Kumarasamy Thangaraj of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Centre For Cellular And Molecular Biology (CSIR–CCMB), who is presently director of the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad and Prof Gyaneshwer Chaubey of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Their research has been published online in the journal ‘Genes and Immunity’, in which they have claimed that Andaman islanders, who are living in isolation for tens of thousands of years, are most likely to be more susceptible to Covid-19. Prof Chaubey, professor of molecular anthropology at BHU, said, “There have been some speculations on the effect of Covid-19 among isolated populations. However, for the first time, we have used genomic data to assess the risk of Covid-19 on the small and isolated populations.” Dr Thangaraj, who traced the origin of Andaman islanders, said, “We have investigated a high-density genomic data of 1,600 individuals from 227 ethnic populations. We found a high frequency of homozygous genes among Onge, Jarawa (Andaman Tribes) and a few more populations who are in isolation and follow a strict endogamy, making them highly susceptible to Covid-19 infection.” The researchers have also assessed the ACE2 gene variants that make individuals susceptible for Covid-19. They found that the Jarawa and Onge populations have a high frequency of these mutations. Such studies are warranted to assess the susceptibility of a population and it will also raise a flag to save the enigmatic Andaman islanders, said Prof Anil K Tripathi, director, Institute of Science, BHU. The study, which also has participants, including Prajjval Pratap Singh, Prof VN Mishra, Prof Royana Singh and Dr Abhishek Pathak from BHU, Dr Prashanth Suravajhala from Amrita University, Kerala, Pratheusa Machha from CSIR-CCMB, Hyderabad, Dr Rakesh Tamang from Calcutta University, Dr Ashutosh K Rai from Saudi Arabia, Dr Pankaj Shrivastava from FSL MP, and Prof Keshav K Singh from University of Alabama, US, also found that populations that carry similar long DNA segments (homozygous) in their genome are most likely to be more susceptible to Covid-19. Their research shows that the infection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has impacted various ethnic groups all over the world. Recent studies suggest that the indigenous groups of Brazil have been massively affected by Covid-19. The death rate was twice as high among the indigenous communities of Brazil. The researchers said, it was also shown that many of the indigenous communities have reached the verge of extinction due to this pandemic. India is home for several indigenous and smaller communities, including Andaman Islanders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/isolated-andaman-tribes-at-highrisk-of-covid-19-infection-study/articleshow/87030804.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: When will the Covid pandemic evolve to being endemic||MUMBAI: The Covid-19 outbreak (a greater than anticipated number of cases) was declared an epidemic (an infection involving a large number of cases in a particular region or community) in January 2020 and then went on to be anointed a pandemic (an infection involving many countries and continents) in March 2020. Today, with the increasing number of vaccinations and more people getting infected in the community, despite the emergence of variants, we are hoping to soon make the move from pandemic to endemic. The infection then regionalises to a particular country or subcontinent, wherein small troughs and peaks keep occurring with periodic regularity, but most of the time the community is largely unaffected owing to immunity and man and virus cohabit. What will nudge the move from pandemic to endemic where each region will have its own constellation of mild virus and variants? Unequivocally we know that the vaccine protects — either you do not get infected or if you do, it is mild and doesn’t significantly necessitate intensive treatment. So vaccination is a must at all and any cost. The amount of antibody that it will generate will protect you for about a year. Please note that immunity after the shot is generated by B cells and T cells, so by just measuring your antibodies and coming to premature conclusions will only add to your anxiety. The question of booster will be addressed in due time in our country as we approach a year and a larger section of the population becomes seropositive (presence of antibodies owing to different causes). Masking with distancing is the next most important step towards the endemic phase. Unfortunately like helmets and seatbelts are worn in this country to prevent payment of the fine if apprehended, masks are mostly worn these days fearing the economic offence. The threat to health is secondary to this large portion of the population which roams with gay abandon, whereby they scout fashionable and matching masks which decorate but don’t protect and that too on the chin or dangling on the neck. We need to restrict the virus from infecting and spreading, thus weakening it and mellowing its ‘bite’. It’s a pity that with the opening up, people have also erased the recent memory of how the whole planet was held ransom for more than a year with devastating consequences, by the Covid virus. The great Spanish flu, which was also a pandemic, after a three-year struggle was beaten down to an endemic and that it is even today, for we still are encouraged to take the flu vaccine. If in an era when medicine and science was not advanced as it is today, nature adopted the same course, with our innovations, we must march swiftly towards this steady state by strangulating the virus. Scientists are working round the clock to find the magic bullet in the form of a pill and the pot of gold doesn’t seem far for Merck’s Molnupiravir sounds promising. Improvisations in vaccines and therapy modes are continuously being researched, but the path to endemic status is the responsibility of every citizen. Whether in the postinfected state or immunised, the enemy is the same and though victory of man is certain, how much bloodshed will we have to endure, rests in the attitude of the people. I speak only for India because there are certain countries where vaccines have not even made an appearance. The pace here has picked up and we have more or less negotiated a large number of regional festivals, so unless we do something stupid or we are unlucky with a mutation, the third wave seems distant. Let’s join hands and make Covid endemic for “jeena yehan marna yehan, iske siva jaana kahan”, (Dr Hemant Thacker is a consultant physician & cardiometabolic specialist practising in south Mumbai and affiliated to the Times Group.Email: dochpt@gmail.com )||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/when-will-the-covid-pandemic-evolve-to-being-endemic/articleshow/87030859.cms||Dr. Hemant Thacker

In the alternative to the implementation of law, petitioner Kalpesh Ashani has also urged HC to quash the provisions of law by treating them in violation of the Constitution. The bench of Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice R M Chhaya found the prayers contrary, and questioned the petitioner’s advocate whether the petition supports the state government’s stand on liquor prohibition laws, which are under challenge by seven petitions that have been admitted by the high court. The lawyer replied that the petitioner intends to support the government on the issue. To this, additional government pleader Tirthraj Pandya said, “They are welcome, if they support us… the more the merrier.” The bench has decided to hear this petition along with the seven petitions .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prohibition-another-plea-in-hc/articleshow/87028881.cms||---

He invited nine little girls to the temple, washed their feet, and performed Kanya Pujan, served lunch and gave them dakshina. He also served lunch to Batuk. While talking to the media, the CM stressed on the need of practicing faith and devotion for sisters and daughters as it can control crime against women. “The feeling of ‘Goddess’ like sanctity and faith towards daughters and sisters should be practiced. If we see them as manifestations of Goddess, frequent crime incidents against sisters and daughters could be controlled.” He appealed to all to join hands for education, health, security and self dependency of women and praised the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for launching flagship scheme ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ for paving the way for women empowerment. While enumerating several schemes of the state government like Kanya Sumangal Yojna he said that the scheme empowers women by ensuring a monetary aid of Rs 15,000 in phases for girl education up to graduation. Yogi said that the state government, under Mukhya Mantri Samuhik vivah Yojna, had solemnizes marriages of over 1.75 lakhs women. The CM extended greetings of Vijayadashmi to people and said, “Even the biggest powers could be defeated by walking on the path of truth, justice and dharma and it certainly ensures victory.” CM Yogi had installed kalash on the first day of Navratra at Shaktipeeth in Gorakhnath temple and on Wednesday evening (Ashtami) he performed Mahanisha Puja. He will lead a traditional grand procession from Gorakhnath temple on the occasion of Vijayadashmi on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-performs-kanya-pujan-at-gorakhnath-temple/articleshow/87030860.cms||---
---||Lucknow||LED bulbs, SIMs fitted in electronicdevices create a scare in Kaushambi||Prayagraj: The entire police machinery, including sleuths of intelligence agencies and Anti-Terror Squad (ATS), were on their toes in neighbouring district of Kaushambi on Thursday to verify the LED bulbs attached to an electronic device (data captured device) that created an alarm among some power consumers. LED bulbs attached to electronic devices with a SIM card were installed in selected houses in Bharwari town of Kaushambi district. The villagers, after becoming suspicious over the installation of LED bulbs attached to an electronic device fitted with a SIM card and data captured device, immediately contacted the police authorities. However, initial police investigations revealed that the electronic device is meant to read actual power consumption, efficiency and provide carbon credit study. The SIM inside the device is attached to a central server to read out actual consumption and carbon emission. The scare started after LED bulbs were given to two families in Bharwari town of Kaushambi district under the Gramin Ujala Yojna three days back. When a house owner noticed that the LED bulbs continued to illuminate despite being switched off, he contacted the nearest electrician to find out the reason. When the electrician opened the electronic device and spotted a SIM and a chip-cum-circuit inside it, he became suspicious and alerted the house owner who then contacted the senior police officers. IG Prayagraj range KP Singh said, “Thorough investigations are underway and ATS has also sent the device to Lucknow for examination. Initial investigation has revealed that the distribution of LED bulbs along with the electronic device was taken up in four districts of eastern UP, including Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Bhadohi and Mirzapur. The LED bulbs attached to special electronic devices were given to selected power consumers, specially those paying their electricity bills on time.” He added that the scheme was in fact launched by the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) among the people living in rural areas. They were provided LED bulbs at a cost of Rs 10 with the objective to bring energy efficiency in rural areas. The IG said that the LED bulb attached to the electronic device was built by a Pune company and its installation and distribution was done by a private group in villages of eastern UP. The device attached to the LED bulb will help study power efficiency and carbon emission. The scheme will reduce carbon emission and people of rural areas will be aware of energy efficiency. “Things would become clearer when the investigations are completed,” said IG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/led-bulbs-sims-fitted-in-electronicdevices-create-a-scare-in-kaushambi/articleshow/87030897.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Accused unlikely to make extra-judicial confession of crime before stranger: HC||NAGPUR: Acquitting a man who allegedly killed his stepmother for marrying again, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court held that any accused is unlikely to make an extra-judicial confession of his crime before a stranger. “It is difficult to accept that any person will make a confession about his acts which are not approved either by society or by law to any stranger. Human nature is such that it tends to disclose misdeeds to only such person in whom he is having semblance of confidence or trust,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar said. Petitioner Dushyan Pushpatode, a resident of Tumsar, was convicted for murder by the Bhandara Sessions Court in 2016, based on the prosecution’s case about the extra-judicial confession made by him in front of witness Pradip Shendre with whom he never met and neither was there any family relations between the two. Additionally, there was no monetary transaction between them. “It is wholly unlikely that the accused would make an extra-judicial confession to a person whom they never knew. It also appears to be wholly improbable that unknown persons would come to seek witness’ help unless he was known to be close to police officers. The witness statement does not even otherwise inspire confidence,” the judges said while quoting a Supreme Court case of Sunny Kapoor versus the Uttarakhand government reported in 2006. According to the prosecution, Pushpatode killed his mother Fulan with a blow on her neck and head with an axe due to some dispute on April 29, 2016. He then went to Shendre’s home and orally admitted his crime. The latter, who was the husband of the village’s police patil, then lodged a complaint with Gobarwahi police in Tumsar. Based on Shendre’s testimony and other evidence, the accused was convicted for murder under section 302. Through counsel Rajendra Daga, he challenged it in HC contending that there was no eyewitness and no direct evidence to prove the crime. Moreover, the entire prosecution’s case was based on circumstantial evidence and on the basis of the oral confession before an unknown person. The judges pointed out that the accused’s extra-judicial confession was oral, not recorded in writing by Shendre and not wholly voluntary as we scanned the evidence. “The voluntariness while making such a confession has its own importance. It is clear that the petitioner and witness were not having any concern whatsoever between them. The evidence shows that there was no intimate relationship between them. There was no reason/occasion for the accused to repose any trust in the witness,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/accused-unlikely-to-make-extra-judicial-confession-of-crime-before-stranger-hc/articleshow/87028870.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||‘Film subsidy not released for six years’||Panaji: The Federation of Film Fraternity of Goa (FFFG), on Thursday, demanded that the Entertainment Society of Goa clear the files of the film subsidies pending for six years. The delegation was led by Konkani filmmaker Laxmikant Shetgaonkar who said that the delay in subsidy has resulted in an economic crisis in the local film industry and reduction in the number of films produced locally. “The state, which hosts an international event on cinema (IFFI), has failed miserably to support its local filmmakers,” Shetgaonkar added. Dinesh Bhonsle, director of films like ‘Enemy’ and ‘Amoree’, said that files related to films made in 2016 are eating dust with the ESG whereas films made between 2013-15 are only partially cleared. “The state assembly congratulates every film which wins a national award but unfortunately the award money to these films is not released since eight years. Local films like Baga Beach, Nachoia Kumpasar, Enemy, K Sera Sera, Amoree and Kajro, among others, are all waiting for the government to clear the files related to the National film award,” he said. Film producer Schubert Cota emphasised the need to encourage film productions the way Maharashtra or Jharkhand government implements its film policy. A government Gazette needs to be taken seriously by the administration otherwise people will lose trust in government schemes. Presently more than 45 film producers are awaiting subsidy for the films they have made since the past six years. Uncertainty over the government subsidy has resulted in low response to film production amongst investors and financiers. FFFG warned that it will involve all artists, technicians, trade unions including IMPPA, FFI and launch their agitation beginning November 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/film-subsidy-not-released-for-six-years/articleshow/87031919.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp may make changes in bank account maintenance||Thiruvananthapuram: Battered by the series of fund fraud recently, the civic body is set to revamp the present system of maintaining bank accounts. The corporation officials held talks with the representatives of SBI the other day and it has been decided to introduce a parent account and child accounts in 11 zonal offices. The SBI has sought seven days to implement the new system. Once the new system is activated, charge officers in zonal offices can monitor transactions on real time basis at all zonal offices. These child accounts will be linked to the parent account which will also reflect the real time transactions. The corporation authorities had also held discussions with some of the new generation banks regarding implementation of virtual ID system for reconciliation of transactions. Mayor Arya Rajendran has told the council about opening separate bank accounts for 11 zonal offices, however, such a system is presently not authorised by the state government. The corporation will have to seek special sanction from the state government to operate separate accounts for zonal offices. The parent account and child account system for zonal offices will soon be activated by the city corporation. Meanwhile, the internal probe team constituted by the city corporation began collecting statements from all the staff at Nemom, Attipra and Sreekaryam where the fraud has been reported. While Nemom police is focusing on cashier regarding the fund fraud at Nemom zonal office, the probe team of the city corporation has also reportedly been told by the staff that the cashier was solely responsible for the fraud. The cashier has recently given a list of people to the corporation secretary, who were involved in handling the cash. However, the probe team is going by the statement that the entire collection for a day may not have been handed over for deposit in the bank account. This contention will put the blame wholly on the cashier. The probe team is expected to submit a report within 30 days; however, given the scope of fraud, an extension will be sought. The local fund audit has reported that many counter foil slips inspected by the team revealed that it did not have the branch code or the bank seal which indicated a clear case of forgery. The audit report says that the zonal office did not possess any document to identify the staff who carries the daily cash from the zonal office to the bank. The civic body has already communicated to IKM to effect relevant updates in the software so that daily remittances in zonal offices can be monitored real time. Soon after the fraud was detected at Sreekaryam office, a meeting was convened in which charge officers were directed to scrutinize all transactions from April 2020 to 2021, however, it went unheeded. Now remittances are being tracked manually and directions have been issued to maintain the reconciliation register and confirm all transactions within 10th of every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-may-make-changes-in-bank-account-maintenance/articleshow/87002909.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: House help robs leading businessman in Raja Park||JAIPUR: A domestic help drugged two other house helps and fled with money and valuables worth several lakhs from the house of a leading industrialist in Raja Park late on Wednesday night. Additional DCP (east) Rajrishi Raj Varma said domestic help Sangita Thapa was the prime accused in the case. “Thapa was hired recently by the family through a placement agency based in New Delhi,” he said, adding that the house belonged to businessman Virendra Jain of Oswal group. Police said the family had gone to Ludhiana to attend a function. Thapa and two other domestic helpers were sleeping inside the house when she allegedly forced them to inhale some type of intoxicating chemicals. “Two helpers, a man and a woman, fell unconscious. They have been shifted to SMS Hospital where they are undergoing treatment,” Varma said. Police suspect that besides Thapa, three others were part of the heist. On Thursday morning, the neighbours found that something was amiss and sought the help of Adarsh Nagar police. Cops and local residents opened the doors and found two persons lying on the floor. “Either they were drugged or compelled to inhale something due to which they had fallen unconscious, while Thapa and her three aides packed cash and valuables into bags and fled,” said an officer. Police examined footage from multiple CCTVs which showed two men leaving the house carrying backpacks. Another clip showed two masked women leaving from the same exit after a few minutes. Sources in Jaipur police suspect the involvement of another woman who had worked in the house before. “It is likely that Thapa had colluded with a former help who worked in the same house. We are trying to examine her antecedents,” an official informed TOI on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Varma said that the two domestic workers were yet to regain consciousness. “We have complete descriptions about Thapa. She will be arrested soon along with her aides,” he said. Based on the CCTV footage and description of Thapa, Adarsh Nagar police alerted other stations in the city. The family is returning from Ludhiana after the police informed them about the incident. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said the value of the items stolen from the house could be several lakhs. However, police are waiting for the family to arrive to ascertain the items stolen by Thapa. Police also said they were checking if a proper verification was conducted before Thapa was hired. “The placement agency which provided the domestic help is based in New Delhi. We don’t know if Thapa had any local connections who possibly arranged the job in the house for the sole reason of stealing money,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/house-help-robs-leading-bizman-in-raja-park/articleshow/87030990.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC admits PIL seeking ban on coal as industrial fuel||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday admitted a PIL seeking directions to the authorities to order industries to shift from using coal as fuel to gas, to curb air pollution in the state. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said that this was important litigation and decided to hear it further on October 29. Petitioner advocate Amit Panchal submitted that shifting to gas as fuel is preferred because the burning of coal leads to air pollution in a significant manner. Compared to coal, PNG/CNG is a clean fuel and results in little or no pollution. There are several states which have mandated the use of gas instead of coal in industrial units. The governments are duty-bound to provide clean air to their citizens and they have got the power to mandate use of gas to run industries under the provisions of the Air Act. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had responded to this PIL by submitting that it has a plan in place to reduce air pollution. The plan was prepared after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) placed Gujarat’s major cities in the list of total 102 ‘non-attainment cities’. There are industrial clusters where the pollution levels were beyond permissible limits, the petitioner added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-admits-pil-seeking-ban-on-coal-as-industrial-fuel/articleshow/87028864.cms||---

A total of 570 out of a thousand Indian respondents, i.e. 57% of travellers, said that they expect to fly out on a business trip later this year. Globally, the number was 50%. “Asia is the top destination for both Indian business and leisure travellers (44% and 45%) with almost a third (29%) expecting to take two trips in the next year,” the survey said adding that 72% of Indian travellers said they are eager to travel next year. Indian travellers (95%) were also willing to provide personal information and health data for the effective use of digital health passports. “Indian travellers are most comfortable providing digital health data for international travel (72%) compared to domestic travel (49%),” it added. Over half (53%) of Indian business travellers would be willing to share their digital health data to visit an office or business event/conference. To track traveller sentiment, the survey, commissioned by Amadeus in early September, gathered responses from over 9,000 people who had travelled abroad in the past 18 months. These included travelers from France, Germany, Russia, Singapore, Spain, the UAE, the UK, the US and 1,000 respondents in India. The biggest concern for Indian travellers was the risk of catching Covid-19 while travelling from lack of social distancing, mask wearing etc (54%), followed by self-isolation/quarantine before and after travel (42%) and concerns about increased queues while travelling due to additional document checks (33%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/57-expect-to-fly-on-work-later-this-year-finds-survey-of-business-travellers/articleshow/87033296.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Headless body case: Murder weapon found in Mumbai's Worli drain||MUMBAI: The city crime branch, while seeking further custody of a police constable and his wife accused of murdering a Solapur-based chilli trader, said on Thursday that they have recovered the murder weapon from a Worli drain, the deceased’s mobile phone, but without the SIM card, and collected his bloodstain samples from the constable’s house at Worli police quarters. The 37th metropolitan magistrate then remanded the couple to further police custody till October 22. On Sunday, the crime branch unit 4 claimed to have cracked the murder of Arjun Jagdale, whose headless body was found outside the CGST quarters at Antop Hill last month, with the arrest of constable Shivshankar Gaikwad (40) and his Monali (35). The couple was booked for murder and destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code. Shivshankar is a police driver for the ACP of Sion division. Senior inspector of unit 4 Indrajit More said there are two offences registered against Shivshankar—a sexual offence case at Worli police station and a dowry-related FIR at Akluj police station in Solapur. Preliminary investigations suggest that Monali, who also hails from Solapur, was having an extra-marital affair with Jagdale and her husband frequently fought with her over this issue. Monali allegedly told the police that Shivshankar, under the pretext of discussing the issue, called Jagdale to Mumbai. She said on September 29 evening, Shivshankar served Jagdale liquor and when he was in an inebriated condition, stabbed him with a knife. He later chopped the body in several pieces, packed them in a plastic bag, drove to Antop Hill Sector 7 in his car and dumped the bag behind a building outside CGST quarters. Police said Shivshankar also tried to burn the body using sanitisers. “Shivshankar tried to destroy evidence, like after disposing of Jagdale’s body parts, he replaced the seat covers and foot mats of his car and also sent it for a wash,” said an officer. In court, Monali’s lawyer, Ajay Dubey, argued that she had not played any role in the crime and there is no need for her further custody and she be remanded to judicial custody. The investigating officer also informed the magistrate that Shivshankar was not cooperating with the investigation and they have already searched two places at Mankhurd dumping ground where he claims to have disposed of Jagdale’s head, but in vain. Police have also engaged scavengers who have been looking for the head at the dump yard for three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/headless-body-case-murder-weapon-found-in-worli-drain/articleshow/87030982.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Allahabad||14 Oct Special effects to mesmerise spectators at Patharchatti Ramleela||Prayagraj: In a bid to make the staging of Ramleela more appealing for the audience, a five-member technical team appointed by the Patharchatti Ramleela committee is giving their best effort to make the various episodes from Ramleela staged more technically sound by employing special effects. Interestingly, the technical team has prepared a huge effigy of Ravan’s brother Kumbhakaran whose bhujas (arms) and neck would be detached from his main body and the effigy would get folded once Lord Ram shoots the arrow to kill the Kumbhakaran on the ninth day of Ramleela. Once the arrow hits the neck portion, the tall effigy would collapse at once on the ground with electric motors. “We are making sincere efforts to represent the scene as mentioned in the scriptures with the help of technology before the spectators as it would make the Ramleela more special and attractive,” said Ram Chandra Patel, an octogenarian who heads the technical team. He also said that the technical team has made arrangements for effigies of certain characters who will be shown flying to make the episodes from the Ramleela more lively and captivating for the audience. Patel said, “The technical team is working tirelessly to give an energetic space and an animated platform to all the artists during the Ramleela episodes.” This year too, the technical team has managed to build an effigy of “Kumbhakaran” which will be 25-foot-high, made of fibre and iron shutters through mechanical support devices. The 81-year-old Ram Chandra Patel, who retired from the education department close to two decades ago, has been associated with the Patharchatti Ramleela committee since 1998, providing technical support to the Ramleela. He is credited with introducing several new elements in the oldest Ramleela in the city. “We are also presenting each episode of the Ramleela with special effects to audiences which they have not witnessed earlier,” said Patel. “Appreciation on the part of the audiences is the real prize for the team,” he added. He also admitted that it is the hard work of the entire team including artists playing different characters who coordinate and cooperate for every scene before it is finally staged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/14-oct-special-effects-to-mesmerise-spectators-at-patharchatti-ramleela/articleshow/87030935.cms||---

Karishma Khubchandani has filed the petition. Her advocate Kiran K Shah submitted that she has 70% disability and faces problems in walking. She appeared in NEET examination and is awaiting the result for admission in medical courses this year. The petitioner contended that section 32(1) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 provides for 5% reservation for the physically challenged students in the government colleges. On basis of the interpretation of this section, the state authorities do not grant quota benefits in the aided and self-financed institutes. The law cannot differentiate between the financial status of the institution and the implementation of the quota may not be restricted to the government colleges only. It was also contended that the affairs of these institutes are managed according to the guidelines of the University Grants Commission (UGC), which does not differentiate between the institutes on account of their financial status. The law is meant to be applicable to all equally. The petitioner further submitted that there are only six medical colleges, which are fully run by the state government. The benefits of reservation for people with disabilities are restricted to these colleges only.

This time, a 24-year-old woman from Mizoram, who stays in Ghatlodia, was caught by residents of a housing society in the Vejalpur area of city just after she abandoned her two-day-old kid there late on Wednesday afternoon. The woman identified as Lallumkov Lalenglina went to Srinandnagar Part 4 society on Sonal Cinema road on Wednesday afternoon and abandoned her newborn near stairs on third floor of J Block. A resident of the flat — Manisha Shah, 48, said that she along with a neighbour heard shrill cries of a baby from the third floor. When they went there, they found a newborn wrapped in cloth who was crying. Shah with help of other society members checked the CCTV footage and found that a woman had dumped the newborn there and was rushing towards the main gate of the society. The residents too rushed towards the main gate and held the woman after which they informed the police about the incident. A team of Vejalpur police went to the spot and sent the woman and her newborn to New Civil hospital in the Sola area of city. Inspector L D Odedara of Vejalpur police said that the woman is a native of Mizoram and had come to city around four months ago. She started working as masseuse at a spa in the Chandlodia area of city. Before that, she was in relationship with a man from Nepal with whom she conceived the baby. As she could not abort the child due to some unavoidable circumstances which she could not explain to cops, she gave birth to the child on October 12. She left the child at the residential society in Vejalpur where four other women from her native place were staying and she was also acquainted to the society. Vejalpur police registered a complaint of abandoning the child and began an investigation. Both mother and the kid have been hospitalized and their condition is stated to be stable, said Odedara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-abandons-newborn-in-vejalpur/articleshow/87028927.cms||---
---||Allahabad||14 Oct VHP gaushala preparing diyas,idols of cow dung for Diwali||Prayagraj: In a first, volunteers of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have set a target of preparing 10,000 idols of God Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi as well as 25,000 diyas of cow dung at a gaushala (cow shelter) in Baharia block in trans-Ganga pocket of Prayagraj district. VHP regional secretary (Gaurakaha) Lal Mani Tiwari told TOI, :“This is the first time that VHP’s gaushala will prepare around 25,000 diyas and 10,000 idols of god and goddess at ‘Shri Prem Gaushala Anusandhan trust’ in village Nari under Baharia block. We have engaged three SHGs, around 33 women workers, for making diyas and idols and production has already started.” Tiwari said, “If the trail is successful, we will take up production of diays and idols at other gaushalas from next year.” “Eco-friendly cow dung diyas and idols have been trending since last year and many people have taken to them as a green way of celebrating the festival of lights and sound. Now, the denizens are ditching clay diyas and instead rooting for those made of cow dung as they see it as a way of empowering gaushalas and local communities,” he added. Tiwari opined that “if the sale of diyas and idols goes better, it will help gaushala authorities in better upkeep of cows. These diyas will be manually made by women SHGs and gaushala owner”. Normally, many people in rural areas buy cow dung for cleaning the house before Diwali, but this time adequate diyas and idols will be available at prominent city markets. The diyas and idols will be made under the supervision of Dinesh Mishra. Local VHP leaders, meanwhile, claimed they are preparing cow dung diyas for the first time. “We are making two kinds of cow dung diyas: one is made of wet dung and the other of dung powder.” “The wet dung diyas take an uneven shape and many customers might not be happy using them, while those made of cow dung powder are perfect,” said a woman volunteer. “The dung powder is mixed with rice powder, vegetable gum and water. Once the diyas dry up, a cotton wick dipped in ghee and glued to a small metal plate is placed inside them,” she said. These diyas will be available at cheaper rates. Interestingly, these diyas easily burn for over half-an-hour if used with desi ghee. Many VHP leaders said “people will prefer to buy diyas and idols made of cow dung as cow is connected to our roots”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/14-oct-vhp-gaushala-preparing-diyasidols-of-cow-dung-for-diwali/articleshow/87030948.cms||---

In the police complaint filed on July 19 the corporation secretary was cited that Biju allegedly forged documents and embezzled the collection amount and thereby misled the corporation. The letter by the secretary said the issue was very serious and that his action accounted for forgery, theft and cheating. The secretary had sought an inquiry to find out whether Biju had colluded with any other official to commit the offence. According to police, Biju was on surveillance. The police tracked his location based on mobile phone records to a place called Chullalam near Kallara. A team reached the spot on Tuesday night and traced the location when the accused’s phone was switched on. The search eventually led to a house near the forest area from where he was arrested around 3 am on Wednesday morning. The series of fund fraud in zonal offices came to light following the expose at Sreekaryam. The office attendant who failed to remit the money in the bank was placed under suspension on July 19. Further probe by the audit wing found out that the collection amount of Rs 5.12 lakhs at Sreekaryam zonal office which was received between January 22 and July 6 never got deposited in the bank account of the city corporation. The cashier was placed under suspension from September 3 and the official who was then the charge officer was meanwhile transferred to Kollam corporation.The civic body told the urban affairs director, that a show cause notice shall be issued to the charge officer. A charge memo was also issued to the cashier and the operational assistant. On Friday, the official who was the charge officer at Sreekaryam was suspended. Meanwhile, police have intensified efforts to arrest Sunitha, the cashier at Nemom zonal office who has been suspended. She is absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/office-attendant-held-in-fund-fraud-case/articleshow/87002963.cms||---

As part of the programme 30 inmates returned to their homes. “We faced a few obstacles, one of which was that the hospital’s bed capacity was exceeded by the number of patients. This issue can be resolved if the hospital development committee can convene on a regular basis,” said Vattiyoorkavu MLA V K Prasanth. We also intend to modify the hospital’s name to mental research centre,” he added. “The Peroorkada mental health centre would be turned into a model institution. This hospital has the potential to become India’s best mental health facility,” Veena George, health minister who was present at the function said. The health care centre authorities said they have had a lot of trouble convincing the patients’ family to receive them back home. “Three of the families had been informed that they would not be coming. The stigma associated with mental health must be removed and society must adopt a more accepting approach towards them. This negligence can cause the individual to go back to his/her past,” said Dr T Sagar, consultant psychiatrist “Society should understand that mental sickness is just a sickness similar to physical illness. It can be cured by treatment,” he said. “Lack of acceptance will only result in an increase of patients in hospitals,”the doctor added. Patients who were stranded in hospitals owing to Covid problems were transported to their homes in special vehicles. They were accompanied by hospital staff, including physicians, paramedical officers, and Vybe volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/back-to-home-scheme-launched-at-peroorkada-hosp/articleshow/87003035.cms||---

Wadhawan is facing charges for economic offences in the Punjab & Maharashtra Co-op (PMC) Bank fraud case. Last month, he was shifted from Arthur Road jail to KEM for cardiac and multi-organ treatment. His advocate argued that he has a constitutional right to better medical facilties at a private hospital as KEM has no cardiac ICU facility. He said Wadhawan’s immunity is compromised and there is high infection risk due to heavy patient load at KEM. The prosecutor said Wadhawan is recovering from a pacemaker surgery and a cardiac ICU will be ready within a week. Justice Sambre said KEM hospital authorities shall take appropriate precaution regarding his co-morbidities.

The 31-year-old from Bopal claimed that, despite paying back Rs 85 lakh, the money lender’s goons abducted him, took him to various states, and forced him to work in call centres there. The Nikol police detained Shubham Rajput, a resident of Ghodasar, following a tip-off that he was involved in the kidnapping. Nikol inspector V D Zala said that Mehta had borrowed Rs 25 lakh at 3% interest from Rahul Chauhan, a loan shark from Khodiyarnagar. Mehta told police, “I paid Rs 85 lakh back. Yet, the accused kidnapped me in March and took me to various states including Goa and Madhya Pradesh. I was tied to a chair and force to work as a call centre executive.” Police said that apart from Shubham, Jitu Chauhan, Rahul Chauhan and Atul Rajput are also involved in the offence. They are are absconding. Meanwhile, police will arrest Shubham after taking Mehta’s statement. Meanwhile, in another case, the Khokhra police arrested four money lenders — Gaurav Chauhan, Sharad Karade, Dalversinh Chauhan and Saurav Chauhan — for their alleged involvement in a extortion case. Two other are absconding. Cops said that complainant Ashish Doshi said he had asked his friend for funds to pay for a car loan instalment. He told police, “I borrowed Rs 20,000 from these money lenders. They levied a penalty of Rs 500 for each day there was a delay in payment. Even though I had paid back Rs 40,000, the accused still harassed me for money. In all, the four accused took Rs 2 lakh from me.” Khokhra police are checking if the accused are involved in similar incidents in other police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-resident-kidnapped-forced-to-work-in-call-centres/articleshow/87028966.cms||---

The Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Sanstha had moved the high court in December 2018 seeking judicial intervention into the dumping of garbage on mangroves. Last Friday, a high court bench of Justice SJ Kathawalla and Justice Milind Jadhav directed the Uran Municipal Council to file a new affidavit. The Uran Municipal Council submitted an affidavit to the high court stating that an alternative site for garbage dumping had been identified and promised that it would not dump solid waste in the restricted area. During the high court hearing on Friday, petitioners’ counsel Meenaz Kakalia pointed out that the garbage dumping on mangroves at Bori-Pakkhadi still continued and presented latest photographs of the site, where a JCB machine was seen spreading the garbage, which had been set on fire and there was smoke billowing from it. Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice Milind N Jadhav said in their order: “The fact remains that the statements made before this court and recorded by the court in its order dated December 19, 2018, has been breached.” B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, said: “None of the authorities here seem to respect mangroves as frontline soldiers against tidal attacks.” Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said that in January last year, an FIR has been filed against the Uran civic body for violations under the Environment Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-hc-raps-uran-civic-body-for-trashing-mangroves/articleshow/87032273.cms||George Mendonca

On being apprised about the inauguration of an international airport in Kushinagar district scheduled to be done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 20, Akhilesh claimed “the airport was built by the SP government and now the BJP is trying to take credit for it”. “The airport which they are going to inaugurate was built by the Samajwadi Party. You all understand, they only know how to change colours and replace one’s name with theirs. This is a new culture in BJP’s politics,” Akhilesh said. Akhilesh also held BJP responsible for what he termed as the ongoing power crisis in the state. “I have come to know only today that the BJP is going to make electricity expensive,” he said and added, “There is anarchy due to the ‘thoko’ policy of the BJP government of the state. Bullets are being fired all over the state,” said Akhilesh. On the question of alliance with uncle Shivpal Yadav, he said, “We will give full respect to all. In the upcoming Assembly election, we will fight in alliance with the smaller parties and the final decision for forging alliance with them will be taken by Samajwadis. The aim of my party is to remove the BJP government. However, Samajwadi Party this time will not forge alliance with any national party, because the experience with such parties previously was not very good.” Akhilesh said that big mandis were built in all the districts under the SP government but BJP could not start it till date. “BJP has even betrayed Ganga Maiya,” he added, “Samajwadi government will save and give full respect to Gau Mata (Cow).” He added, the laptops given by the SP government are still running today. SP will also work on a plan to reduce the price of mustard oil. After completing the Samajwadi Vijay Yatra started from Jajmau bridge in Kanpur, he toured several districts of Bundelkhand including Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jalaun and Kanpur Dehat, and left for Lucknow on Thursday morning from Kanpur Dehat after meeting party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/we-will-win-400-seats-in-2022-polls-akhilesh/articleshow/87030992.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Ahmedabad||Parking dispute takes casteist turn in Satellite||Ahmedabad: A cop was allegedly thrashed by four persons — including two women — in a residential society in the Satellite area of the city. Above that, what began as a parking dispute took a casteist turn when the accused allegedly began bragging, “Patels are in power now and they can park their vehicles anywhere.” This is in the FIR filed at Satellite police station on Wednesday. Chintan Pandya, 26, a resident of Jodhpur Park Society in Satellite, a constable with B division traffic police, filed a complaint against his four neighbours — Vidya Patel, her son Keyur Patel, Vidya’s brother-in-law Ashish Patel, and their relative Minakshi Patel — alleging that they assaulted him. Pandya in his complaint said that he had returned from work at around 6pm on Wednesday and tried to find space in the society’s parking area. Pandya saw that the car belonging to his neighbour Vidya Patel was not parked properly, due to which he did not get space to park his car. He thus parked his car on the way to the parking sheds and went home. After a while, Ashish came to Pandya’s house and asked him to remove his car from the way to the parking sheds as it was obstructing others. Pandya told them to first park their car properly so that he could also get some space in the parking shed. “This irked them and they began abusing me. One of the two men told me that the car belongs to a Patel and it will remain parked where it is. They said that they would not remove their car. They said Patels are in power now and they can park their vehicles anywhere,” said Pandya in the FIR. Pandya said that when he protested, the two men along with Vidya and Minakshi began thrashing him and tore his clothes. Two other society members called the police and Pandya later filed a complaint for causing hurt, use of abusive words and abetment against the four accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parking-dispute-takes-casteist-turn-in-satellite/articleshow/87028943.cms||---

The first train set is being prepared for trial on the test track in the Depot and before this happens, signals are being charged and tested. This process is known as ‘signalling power on test’. Meanwhile, signal installation work has almost completed in the Depot and on the mainline. A total of 29 signals are to be installed in the Depot, out of which, 27 have already been installed. The mainline is to be equipped with 43 signals, out of which, 35 have been placed. Currently, signal installation work is pending at the Motijheel Metro Station only and that too will be completed soon, UPMRC stated on Thursday evening. Metro train’s movement will be controlled with the three coloured signals: Red, Violet and Green. Red signals means stop, while the violet signal allows for the conditional proceed (movement with a prescribed low-speed limit). This signal is shown when another train is in the vicinity. Green refers to the clear route and the driver (train operator) can proceed freely with the allowed speed limit. One more kind of signal is there for movement inside the Depot. This signal has three white lights. When two lights glow horizontally, the driver is instructed to stop and when the two lights glow at a 45-degree angle, the train is allowed to proceed. This signal is called a ‘shunt signal.’ Meanwhile, Metro construction work has commenced at Naveen Market crossing. Here the work of construction of the underground station has started. The construction company would construct four underground metro stations — Chunniganj, Naveen Market, Bada Chauraha and Nayaganj. This work is part of leg two of phase one of Kanpur Metro project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/signal-installation-on-prioritysection-nearing-completion/articleshow/87030972.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai police bust interstate gang selling stolen phones||MUMBAI: The city crime branch arrested four accused and busted a major interstate gang that sold stolen phones, making them untraceable by changing their IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers. IMEI is a unique 15-digit code that precisely identifies a device with SIM card input. It helps security agencies track any mobile phone. The gang sold the stolen phones in Bangladesh and Nepal. The four arrested accused are Sameer Shaikh, Mohammed Shamshad Shaikh, Mohsin Shaikh alias Micheal and Sunny Bhola Yadav. All were arrested for stealing, cheating and forgery. Sameer, who hails from Delhi, appears to be the brains of the operation, said cops. The other three are residents of Mira Road and Govandi. DCP (crime) Datta Nalawade said that earlier this week, unit 6 of the crime branch was tipped off that a huge stack of stolen mobile phones had been stored in a house in Govandi. There, cops found 248 phones stolen from across the country, gadgets to change IMEI numbers, over Rs 1 lakh in cash, along with foreign currency and a car — totally worth Rs 56 lakh, said inspector Ravindra Salunkhe. “The gang members were in touch with agents across the country who buy stolen mobile phones from thieves at throwaway prices. The gang sold the phones in Bangladesh and Nepal after tampering with their IMEI numbers,” said DCP Nalawade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gang-stole-phones-changes-imei-numbers/articleshow/87031024.cms||Ahmed Ali

Later, the woman gave birth to a newborn on the toilet seat. During this, the head of the newborn got stuck in the siphon. The hospital staff broke the toilet seat and pulled the infant out, but by then the newborn had succumbed. At the same time, the condition of the mother also deteriorated. Taking cognizance of the matter, Dr Sanjay Kala, principal Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi memorial medical college, has ordered a probe after forming a committee. Haseen Bano (30) wife of Mobin, a resident of Kantipur in Shivrajpur block, came to the hospital emergency at 8.30 pm on Wednesday night. "She was admitted to Bed 40 of Ward 7 at 10.30 pm under the supervision of Dr Vishal Gupta of Medicine on symptoms of dengue," informed her kin while talking to reporters. Mobin, her husband further said that at around 12.30 pm, he pleaded with the doctors and nursing staff present there when his wife was in acute labor pain. "Instead of helping us, the staff bluntly replied saying that this is not their job, and asked me to remain quiet. It was when her labour pain became unbearable, his wife went to the toilet, where she delivered the newborn, but shockingly the child slipped and the head of the newborn got stuck in the hole of the seat," he alleged. They tried to take it out, but in vain. In the meantime, other family members rushed to the emergency room and sought help from the staff. The Emergency Medical Officer (EMO) arrived there with the police. He also tried but all his efforts proved futile. After an hour and a half, the child was taken out by breaking the seat, but the child had died. “The issue is serious. A committee has been constituted to investigate the entire matter. Strict action will definitely be taken against the culprit," said Dr Kala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/newborn-dies-after-woman-gives-birth-in-hospital-toilet/articleshow/87031021.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Jaipur||Alwar, Bharatpur districts likely to lose NCR status||JAIPUR: Following the new draft policy approved by the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB), major areas of Alwar and Bharatpur districts, including the two cities, of the state may no longer be part of the National Capital Region (NCR). As per the draft Regional Plan 2041, areas beyond the 100km radius are not likely to be the main part of NCR and this may result in the exclusion of both the districts of Rajasthan. At present, the NCR is spread around 150-175km, covering the entire districts and rural areas. However, the new delineation is proposed to be carried out based on the principle of 100km radius from Rajghat in Delhi, plus 1km in each direction along major transport corridors. Major transport corridors include national higways, expressways, state highways and regional rapid transit systems. A senior official at the town planning wing said, “As per the draft Regional Plan 2014, areas beyond 100km are unlikely to be part of the main NCR. While Alwar is approximately 160km away, Bharatpur is over 200km. Both the cities are likely to be excluded.” On Tuesday, at a meeting chaired by housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri, the UDH minister of Rajasthan, Shanti Dhariwal, requested the Centre to incorporate the existing area of both the districts in NCR after the delineation. The final plan will be notified by March 2022, according to the housing and urban affairs ministry. Under the Constitution (69th Amendment) Act 1991, the NCR zone was created by combining capital Delhi and some adjoining areas. Alwar was in NCR since inception, while Bharatpur became a part in 2013. According to sources, both the districts have failed to reap the benefits of being part of NCR in the absence of Centre’s assistance over the past several years. When Bharatpur was included, it was expected to attract more investors and eventually become an industrial hub like Neemrana and Bhiwadi. “Not just government bodies, private players too were expected to invest in this region. But all the high hopes fell flat,” said a source. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) also did not include major industrial towns of Bhiwadi, Tapukara and Khushkhera (BTK) on the route alignment of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) proposed between Delhi-Gurgaon-Rewari-Alwar. A source said that Rajasthan had also highlighted the matter. “The first phase of this project hardly benefits the state despite sharing the equity. Rajasthan was the first state to give its consent for sharing equity in the project,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/alwar-bharatpur-districts-likely-to-lose-ncr-status/articleshow/87031038.cms||---

The notes were of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 denominations. One of the accused, Vikesh Vaniyar, a resident of Khokhra, tried to commit suicide by strangling himself, but was rescued.

The cops also recovered Rs 1,700 in genuine notes from them. DCP Achal Tyagi said the the three accused brought the counterfeit notes from Salem in Tamil Nadu at the request of two people from the city. He said teams will be sent to Tamil Nadu for probe as they have not got evidence that the notes were printed in Gujarat. “We are matching the quality of notes with those seized in Odisha,” he said. He said fake notes with a face value Rs 15 lakh were seized in Odisha in August, and were found to have been printed there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-arrested-with-rs-3-2l-in-fake-notes/articleshow/87029014.cms||---
---||Mumbai||This year may bring cheer to housing market in Mumbai, says report||MUMBAI: The festive season that kicked off with Navratri on October 7 has brought increased sale of home units in the city, raising government revenue collection to Rs 24 crore, which is higher by 78% over August and 37% over September. With upbeat consumer sentiment and support from low interest rates, improved consumer perception of home ownership will get a boost from the festive season leading up to Diwali, said a report released by Knight Frank India on Thursday. The report by the property consultant said: “The significant but limited period stamp duty cut window that ended on March 31, 2021, was a key catalyst for the city’s residential market. The closure of this incentive window coincided with the severe pandemic second wave, which adversely impacted the homebuyer sentiment in the interim. However, since then the housing market has again picked up momentum. With the central bank maintaining its stance on low policy interest rate, and developers offering attractive offers, sales trajectory has picked up again with sales in July and August higher than pre-pandemic same months in 2018 and 2019.” The Shradh period between September 21 and October 6 also saw a slowdown in decision-making for high-value purchases like real estate. Developers have now aligned new launches to benefit from the upbeat sentiment, said the report. Shishir Baijal, chairman & MD, Knight Frank India, said: “After almost half a decade of depressed festival season, this year may break the cycle and be one of the best. It is encouraging to see that the daily average of home registrations has jumped in the festive period without the stamp duty incentive support.

In her police complaint against 11 persons, including her husband and in-laws, she has claimed that in 2003 her husband had kidnapped her from home after drugging her parents. He had also taken her gold ornaments. Later, she was taken to Jabalpur where she was forcibly married to him in an Arya Samaj temple in presence of his relatives. She further claimed that her husband continuously thrashed and tortured her from the very first day of the marriage. After getting pregnant, she was asked to get aborted but when she refused, her in-laws stopped giving her food. She somehow survived by taking food from the neighbours. After giving birth to a daughter, she was again subjected to continuous torture. After she conceived once more, her husband thrashed her severely and tried to damage her private part. Her in-laws tried to kill her on several occasions by dosing her with kerosene oil, by poisoning her and by trying to throw acid but each time she survived, she claimed in the police complaint. She further mentioned in the complaint that her husband used to sodomise her son also apart from taking her daughter to various places after her school and trying to sell her and coaxing her to “go to one Tilak’s place and he will make you rich”. On the basis of the complaint, police have lodged an FIR against several persons, including the husband, sister-in-law and mother-in-law of the woman under sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 366 (Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 377 (unnatural offences) of IPC besides Section 4/5 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The police have also lodged two separate FIRs against 200 BSP and 250 SP party functionaries who had come to submit a memorandum against the FIR for violating Section 144 and Covid safety protocol on Wednesday. Meanwhile, police have so far arrested five persons, including the father of the girl. SP Lalitpur, Nikhil Pathak said, “I have constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under an additional SP for a free and fair investigation into the entire episode. Also, some more police teams are coming from the range to intensify the procedure of arrests. Our teams are continuously searching the accused, both in the district and outside the district.” On Tuesday, a 17-year-old girl had lodged an FIR against 28 persons, including her father and sitting party office-bearers of SP and BSP along with some close relatives for raping her for the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/lalitpur-rape-survivors-mother-files-fir-for-domestic-violence-sodomy-with-son/articleshow/87031062.cms||---

The civic body authority is also considering canopies on the vending sites but these can be installed only after permission is received from the UT urban planning department. MC officials visited the site on Wednesday evening to figure out how to provide facilities in a way that would benefit both vendors and customers. Since this is the biggest site located near residential areas, proper sanitation is one of the priority concerns. The officials also discussed ways to make these facilities sustainable in the long run. Sources said the MC would use vending fee received from vendors on site development. The civic body receives vending fee on a monthly basis from registered street vendors and the amount varies in accordance with their trade. Defaulting vendors get repeated reminders to pay their vending fee. The issue has frequently been raised in monthly general house meetings. While vendors have been demanding more facilities at the site, previous plans to provide amenities were derailed by the Covid pandemic. Other sites to follow Municipal commissioner Anindita Mitra said, “We have been working to provide all required facilities at the Sector 15 vending zone to make it a model vending zone. Later, these facilities will also be provided at other vending zones. We have made some designs for vending sites, but they need the approval of the chief architect office of the Chandigarh administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sec-15-vending-zone-to-get-facilities-emerge-as-example-for-others/articleshow/87029037.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Bani Park murder accused found hanging in Chomu||JAIPUR: One of the shooters and a key conspirator wanted in the murder of history-sheeter Ajay Yadav was found hanging from a ceiling fan at his relative’s house on Thursday. The city police claimed that the deceased, Mukesh Yadav (30), allegedly committed suicide shortly after 3.45pm in his relative’s house in Chomu. Police are yet to determine the reason behind Mukesh’s alleged suicide even as a senior officer claimed he possibly ended his life after he ran out of money and people who would harbour him. Mukesh was a history-sheeter, and one of the four persons who shot at Ajay and then smashed his head with a stone in Bani Park on September 21. He was on the run after police listed him as one of the main plotters behind the murder. “He (Mukesh) had changed his appearance. He was on the run for a long time. He arrived at his relative’s house on Thursday around 3pm. His relative had gone to get some food for him, when he returned he found Mukesh hanging from a fan,” an officer said. Police said that an inquest was registered at Chomu police station. No suicide note has been recovered. Bani Park police had claimed that history-sheeter Pradeep Yadav had plotted the revenge scheme in cahoots with Mukesh. “Pradeep was left paralysed after Ajay’s two henchmen shot at him in February last year. Pradeep was nursing a deep grudge against Ajay. He joined hands with Mukesh and together decided to hit back at him,” the officer said. Both Ajay and Mukesh were close collaborators until differences emerged between them. “They parted ways following disputes over property. Also, Ajay was booked for firing at a history-sheeter in 2015. Mukesh did not help in harbouring Ajay,” the officer said. Police have so far arrested four accused in the murder case. “Teams were constituted to arrest Mukesh, but he has been frequently changing his hideouts,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bani-park-murderaccused-foundhanging-in-chomu/articleshow/87031066.cms||---

The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and SarangKotwal in a detailed16-page order, however, said it was not commenting anything more on the meritsof thecase, andsaid that Adsul has the liberty to seek anticipatory bail before the competent court and the court can then decide such a plea on its own merits. Adsul, the former Lok Sabha member from Amravati reserved constituency who was union minister of state for finance between 2002 and 2004, through his counsel Abhinav Chandrachud and advocate Sachin Thorat had argued for interim protection, too, from any coercive action, apprehending arrest. He said actions and proceedings against him were “malafide’’ “arbitrary’’ and “smacked of political vendetta.’’ He had sought quashing of the Enforcement Case Information Report registered by the ED. The ED through additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Shreeram Shirsat demonstrated what material it had against Adsul and the statements it had recorded. Chandrachud said there is no offence registered on which the ED can base its case, as legally required and that the ED officers were “acting out of malice at the behest of Ravi Rana,’’ a politician. The HC noted that no officer was, however, named or made party. “Court cannot go by general perception and assumptions,’’ said the HC in its order adding, “the burden is heavy on those who allege malafides to prove them.’’ “Once we conclude that malafides are not proved, there is no ground on which we can interfere to stall proceedings under the PMLA,’’ said the HC noting that it did find this case to be exceptional to hold that the ED case or probe “are either abuse of power or are malafide.’’ The ASG had said Adsul’s “conduct’’ be seen as he did not respond to summons and when they went to his residence “he had no medical complications and by calling an ambulance admitted himself to the hospital.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-rejects-adsul-plea-for-quashing-ed-proceedings/articleshow/87031065.cms||Swati Deshpande

We collected 55 samples of fafda and jalebis which are made of gram flour,” said an AMC official. The official said that the samples taken will be sent to the laboratory for testing. When asked if food samples taken a day ahead of the festival will serve any purpose as Amdavadis are going to make a line 0outside the same shops, the official did not have any answers.  Sources in the AMC claim that results of hundreds of samples are still pending at the AMC-run public health laboratory.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Western Railway might let you on AC local by paying the fare difference||MUMBAI: Western Railway said it may consider allowing second-class and first-class ticket holders to commute by AC trains by paying the difference in fares. AC services on CR and WR have seen poor response with most services, running almost empty. Western Railway’s general manager Alok Kansal said, “We may consider allowing passengers of other classes to travel by air-conditioned local trains by paying the difference [in fare].” It will be collected by ticket examiners deployed on AC trains to penalise unauthorised passengers. Ticket examiners have powers to charge extra fare from those travelling a longer distance than allowed to or get upgraded to a higher class. Passengers welcomed this move saying it would be a win-win situation. Borivli resident Avinash Vyas said, “Many a time, I feel like boarding the air-conditioned train while waiting for my non-air-conditioned train. But I cannot even though I wish to by paying the difference in the fare.” The railway board is likely to revise fares for single journey tickets on air-conditioned local trains to attract ridership as most of the trips, particularly during non-peak hour, have very few commuters. The new fares will be based on tariff structure prepared by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority for the Metro corridors. A senior railway official said fares for season tickets will, however, remain unchanged as authorities feel they are highly subsidised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-might-let-you-on-ac-local-by-paying-the-fare-difference/articleshow/87031093.cms||Manthan K Mehta

Police had sought his custody for five days to find out from where he had purchased the rat killer and the ice-cream which he fed his wife Shobhana and daughter Kavya and since when he was planning to kill them. “He has not yet told us about the poison and ice-cream. We will also interrogate him if there was any other reason for the killings besides what we have found out so far,” said a police official. During the custody period, police will also take him to his in-laws’ house, where he used to live, for reconstruction of the crime. Police said that since his arrest on Wednesday, Patel has not spoken much and has given only brief answers about whatever he was asked. Patel had fed rat killer-laced ice-cream to Shobhana and Kavya when they returned from garba on October 10 and initially floated a theory that they were not responding in sleep. A day after the deaths investigators found rat-killer from the scrap on the terrace of the house, which raised many questions. On Tuesday, when Patel was questioned for hours about the search history and the rat killer, he broke down and admitted to killing the two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/4-day-police-custody-for-accused-patel/articleshow/87027952.cms||---
---||India||As G20 nations unlock, GHG emissions set to see 4% rise||NEW DELHI: Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) are rebounding across the G20 countries this year after a short period of decline due to shutdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, and the world is far from meeting the 1.5 degree C global warming limit despite ‘net zero’ commitments by 14 of them, said a report on annual stocktake and comparison of climate actions of these big and emerging economies. The report, released by Climate Transparency on Thursday, noted that energy-related CO2 emissions plunged by 6% across the G20 in 2020, but it’s now projected to increase by 4% with four countries - Argentina, China, India and Indonesia – heading to exceed even their 2019 emission levels. India is, however, the only developing country among the G20 nations with sufficient "policies and actions" to achieve its current climate action goals by 2030. "The country made significant progress in terms of its voluntary mitigation targets. It is aiming to deliver 450 GW of installed renewable capacity and has recently launched the National Hydrogen Mission to promote clean energy transition. However, there is a strong need of mobilizing international support (including climate finance) for resilient and inclusive growth in the country,” said Abhishek Kaushik from The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Times ViewThe emissions plunged globally in 2020 due to lockdowns, which reduced human activity in every sphere. What is worrying is that our 2021 emission levels are projected to surpass 2019 levels. At a time when the planet is hurtling towards an environmental catastrophe, it is in everyone’s interest that emissions are reduced. To that end, extra effort and commitment is needed. The time for cosmetic measures is over. Tough calls are required. There’s no other way out.The Climate Transparency is a global partnership of 16 think tanks and NGOs, including TERI from India, that brings together experts from the majority of G20 countries for this annual stocktake. “Rebounding emissions across the G20, the group responsible for 75%of global GHG emissions, shows that deep and fast cuts in emissions are now urgently needed to achieve net zero announcements,” said Gahee Han from the South Korean organisation Solutions for Our Climate, one of the lead authors of the report. The report, at the same time, noted some positive developments, such as the growth of solar and wind power among G20 members, with new records of installed capacities in 2020. It said the share of renewables in energy supply is projected to grow from 10% in 2020 to 12% in 2021. On the flip side, the report underlined that in spite of these positive changes, dependence on fossil fuels is not going down. It showed that the consumption of coal is projected to rise by nearly 5% in 2021, while the consumption of gas has increased by 12% across the G20 during 2015-2020. On the ‘net zero’ front, only 14 G20 members had committed to such targets covering almost 61% of global GHG emissions by August. Six countries which have not yet committed ‘net zero’ targets are Australia, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Noting low mitigation ambition, experts warned that the current targets, even if fully implemented, would still lead to global warming of 2.4 degree C by the end of the century from pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-g20-nations-unlock-ghg-emissions-set-to-see-4-rise/articleshow/87033316.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Eighteen countries, including China, Brazil and Kuwait, shared the top rank with a GHI score of less than five, the website of the Global Hunger Index. which tracks hunger and malnutrition, said on Thursday. The report, prepared jointly by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organisation Welt Hunger Hilfe, termed the level of hunger in India “alarming”. In 2020, India was ranked 94th out of 107 countries. Now with 116 countries in the fray, it has dropped to 101st rank. India’s GHI score has also decelerated — from 38.8 in 2000 to the range of 28.8-27.5 between 2012 and 2021. The GHI score is calculated on four indicators — undernourishment; child wasting (the share of children under the age of five who are wasted i.e who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition); child stunting (children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition) and child mortality (the mortality rate of children under the age of five). “People have been severely hit by Covid-19 and pandemic-related restrictions in India,” the report said. Neighbouring countries like Nepal and Pakistan have fared better at feeding its citizens than India, according to the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-hunger-index-india-trails-pakistan-bangladesh-nepal/articleshow/87033372.cms||---

Especially if it’s a question of Durgotsav and a determined Bengali! The community in Vadodara proved that it knows how to manage a way to carry on with the traditional celebration with the same fervour and intensity despite not being granted permission by the police for pandals at open plots and community halls due to Covid concerns. They simply shifted their ‘pujo’ venues to temple premises or residential colonies this year. Not everyone is happy with the lack of usual razzmatazz associated with the festivities inside the new cramped spaces, but as they say, ‘never say no to a good pujo’! “We used to organize Durga puja at Manjapur community hall for years. But this year, due to Covid restrictions, we didn’t get permission for organizing puja at the venue. So, we shifted the pandal to Bileshwar Mahadev Temple premises in Manjalpur. It’s a spacious venue,” said Avijit Bakshi, core committee member of Dakshin Baroda Sanskriti Parishad that has been organizing Durga puja in the city since the 1960s. “We have been following all Covid safety protocols by restricting the crowd and following social distancing norms. Also, we give packed lunches to the devotees that they can have at home,” Bakshi told TOI. Every year, about 18 such Durga puja pandals are installed in different areas of the city that has a sizeable Bengali community population. The East West Cultural Association too has shifted its Durga pandal to Ma Bhavatarini Kali Mandir in Gotri this year. “We used to organize Durga puja at Kirti Mandir for years. This time we didn’t get permission to organize the puja in open space, so our association shifted the pandal to Premanand Hall. Devotees have been visiting our pandal in good numbers while also following Covid safety norms,” said Ashok Gupta of Banga Sanskriti Sangha. The police department this year refused to give permission for Durga puja pandals at open plots and community halls. Bengali community leaders were upset as they felt that organizing Durga puja in congested residential colonies would make social distancing more difficult. The state government has also put a ban this year to celebrate Navratri at open plots and big venues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/open-plots-shut-pujo-spirit-unlocked-at-temples/articleshow/87028054.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Goa||Goa: More parties in poll fray will benefit BJP, says Amit Shah||PANAJI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday told the BJP legislature wing and senior functionaries that winning the 2022 assembly polls for the party would be easier than the previous elections as AAP, TMC and Congress would fight for the same vote share, while BJP’s would remain intact. Shah told the MLAs and core committee members that this is the first time since 2007 that BJP has a better opportunity to win the assembly election and told them that he would be returning to Goa next month to chalk out a detailed strategy for the polls, scheduled early next year. After some MLAs from the minority community raised apprehensions about winning the assembly elections, Shah told them to meet their religious heads and take them into confidence. He also told them to put up a united face and help each other so that BJP gets majority on its own. He told the MLAs to visit the booths and understand why the karyakartas are unhappy, if they are, and assuage their feelings. Shah’s response came after some MLAs said it would not be easy for them to win the elections, while others raised the issue that those who had joined from Congress were not getting any support from the local workers of the party. Some of them also said there needs to be a holistic plan with shared responsibilities if they wanted to win the elections. “If we fight the elections as one unit, then nobody can defeat BJP. But we need a proper strategy for it,” they said. Shah also held meetings with the CM and Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis. He met the core committee members separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-parties-in-poll-fray-will-benefit-bjp-shah/articleshow/87031709.cms||---
---||Goa||Oppn asks Union min to visit Goa often and tour entire state so roads are repaired for his convoy||Panaji: Union home minister and former BJP national president Amit Shah should visit Goa every month and tour the entire state, said former revenue minister Rohan Khaunte on Thursday. Khaunte was taunting the state government for its feverish attempt to repair only those roads that Shah’s convoy would use, while the roads in the rest of the state remain dilapidated. Considering the current pace of roads being hotmixed in Panaji and Taleigao, places Shah is expected to visit, the people of Goa would request the him to come on a monthly basis, said Khaunte. “We would also request Amit Shah to tour the entire state, so that the roads would be hotmixed to host him,” he said. Khaunte expressed disgust that while people are meeting with accidents due to the massive potholes in Goa, the government chose to wait for Shah to arrive to repair them. State Congress spokesperson Shriniwas Khalap took a similar dig at the Pramod Sawant-led government, asking Shah to visit Calangute, the Chogm road in Porvorim, Baga, Arpora, Siolim and Mapusa. “No specific reason. Just because wherever you go, they repair roads,” said Khalap in a tweet addressed to Shah and the CM. Roads across the state are dilapidated and at most places completely washed out, making daily commutes back-breaking and slow. Khaunte also said that the state government’s initiative of Sarkar Tumchya Dari is merely an eyewash, and demanded that BJP should pay from their pockets for such initiatives, as the programmes held are more a part of election engineering of BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-asks-union-min-to-visit-goa-often-and-tour-entire-state-so-roads-are-repaired-for-his-convoy/articleshow/87031735.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa court rejects pre-arrest bail plea of rape accused||COLVA: Additional sessions judge Durga Madkaikar rejected the anticipatory bail application of the alleged rape accused Michael Crasto citing court jurisdiction. Cuncolim police had registered an offence against the accused on September 30, after the survivor complained that the accused sexually exploited her since 2010, when she was just 15 years old. She stated that the accused threatened of killing her father if the exploitation was narrated to her parents. The accused started following her wherever she used to go, due to which she even discontinued her studies, it was stated in the complaint. Cuncolim police registered the offence under provisions of the IPC, Goa Children’s Act, section 6, 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Scheduled Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, as the survivor belonged to the scheduled tribe community. Public prosecutor G Gaonkar submitted that the offence committed by the applicant is triable by the Children’s Court and not by the additional sessions court. So also, other offences alleged to have been committed by the applicant come under the Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, and POCSO Act, which the present court has no jurisdiction to decide the bail application.

---||Gurgaon||Student accused of Gurugram campus murder arrested||GURUGRAM: A final-year law student wanted for the murder of a fellow student last week on the campus of SGT University was arrested on Thursday. Police said since the October 8 shooting, Punkit alias Lucky had been sheltered by a maternal aunt in Sonipat and cops tracking him eventually tasted success at Chhawla in Delhi when Lucky came to meet his father. Lucky is accused of shooting final-year BAMS student Vinit, who died of a bullet injury in the abdomen. Police said the dispute between the two was over their ties with another student in BSc nursing, who Lucky had befriended around six months ago. She and Vinit had been friends but, according to Vinit’s relatives and friends, they had grown apart in recent months. On October 8, Vinit was in class when around 10.30am, Rahul, Nitesh and two others came to his class and asked him to come out. The teacher objected and Vinit remained in the class. At noon, when the campus was taking a lunch break, Vinit asked his friends to accompany him to the hostel, fearing Lucky, Rahul and Nitesh would accost him. Nitesh is Lucky’s brother and also a student of law at the university, police said. Vinit’s apprehensions were right. When he and three friends emerged from A Block, they saw Lucky and three others waiting near the gate, police said. The moment they saw Vinit, they confronted him. Vinit’s friends tried to intervene but before they could, he was shot. According to the police, Nitesh had grabbed Vinit from the back and Lucky shot him. When Vinit collapsed, Lucky and the others fled. Vinit was taken to the hospital on campus where he succumbed to his injury. The probe was transferred to the crime branch two days ago. On Thursday, inspector Bijender Hooda, in-charge of the crime unit (Sector 10) and his team nabbed Lucky. “He had come to collect money from his father,” said Hooda. Lucky’s brother Nitesh is still at large. Police said they were still investigating the involvement of Rahul and the nursing student in the killing. Lucky’s father Dhananjay Bharadwaj runs a garments showroom at Najafgarh in Delhi. They are originally from Asauda village in Jhajjar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/student-accused-of-campus-murder-held-after-6-days-in-hiding/articleshow/87031147.cms||Bagish Jha

LinkedIn had long been the only major American social network that operated in China. Twitter and Facebook have been blocked in the country. But to do business in China, LinkedIn censored the posts made by its millions of Chinese users in accordance with Chinese laws, something that other American companies were often reluctant or unable to do. “We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China,” LinkedIn said in a blog post on Thursday, adding it did not find the same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed like it has globally. LinkedIn said it would replace the Chinese service, which restricts posting of certain content due to regulatory requirements, with a new portal called InJobs. The new service, which will be launched later this year, will not include a social feed or the ability to share posts or articles, it said. China’s internet watchdog in May said it had found LinkedIn as well as Microsoft’s Bing search engine and about 100 other apps were engaged in improper collection and use of data and ordered them to fix the problem. Officials required LinkedIn to perform a self-evaluation and offer a report to the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator. The service was also forced to suspend new sign-ups of users inside China for 30 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/microsoft-to-shut-down-linkedin-in-china/articleshow/87033536.cms||---
---||World||Bow-and-arrow attack killed 5, Norway sees it as ‘act of terror’||KONGSBERG: Norwegian authorities said on Thursday the bow-and-arrow rampage by a man who killed five people in a small town appeared to be a terrorist act, a shocking attack in a Scandinavian country where violent crime is rare. Police identified the attacker as Espen Andersen Braathen, a 37-year-old Danish citizen, who was arrested on Wednesday night. They said he used the bow and arrow and possibly other weapons to randomly target people at a supermarket and other locations in Kongsberg, a town of about 26,000 where he lived, before he was seized by police on the street. Police said they believe he acted alone. “The whole act appears to be an act of terror,” said Hans Sverre Sjoevold, head of Norway’s domestic intelligence service, known as the PST. “We do not know what the motivation of the perpetrator is,” Sjoevold said in English. He said the suspect was known earlier by the PST, but he declined to elaborate. Regional police chief Ole B Saeverud described the man as being known as a Muslim convert and said there “earlier had been worries of the man having been radicalised.” Police said four women and one man between the ages of 50 and 70 were killed. Three other people were wounded, police said. Braathen is being held on preliminary charges and will face formal charges on Friday. Police were alerted to a man shooting arrows about 6.15 pm (local timne) and arrested him about 30 minutes later. Regional prosecutor said that after the man’s arrest, he “clearly described what he had done. He admitted killing the five people.” Norwegian media reported that the suspect previously had been convicted of burglary and possession of drugs, and last year a local court granted a restraining order ordering him to stay away from his parents for a six-month period after he threatened to kill one of them. Mass killings are rare in Norway, and the attack drew comparisons with the country’s worst peacetime slaughter a decade ago, when a right-wing domestic extremist killed 77 people with a bomb, a rifle and a pistol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/bow-and-arrow-attack-killed-5-norway-sees-it-as-act-of-terror/articleshow/87033579.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Friend of Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son was in car that ran over farmers, says SIT||BAREILLY: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence is confident that it has found evidence that main murder accused Ashish Mishra’s friend, Ankit Das, was in one of the cars in the convoy and subsequently fled, sources told TOI. Four farmers and a journalist were among eight who died that day. The SIT took Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, Ankit and two members of the convoy — Shekhar Bharti and Lateef — to Kheri on Thursday under heavy security to recreate the crime scene, with forensic experts from Lucknow examining the site. Vehicles like the ones in the minister’s convoy that day were brought in and dummies placed to represent protesting farmers. Media was not allowed entry. Ashish stayed on in the police jeep while the three others were asked to step out. “The crime scene recreation was done with the help of experts from Lucknow. The investigation team has gathered evidence against the accused but the information can’t be shared until the probe is over,” ADG (Lucknow zone) SN Sabat told TOI. After visiting the violence site, the accused were taken to a ground at Banbirpur where a wrestling match had been organised on October 3, the day of the violence. Ashish had earlier said he was at the wrestling match when the killings took place. However, SIT sources had told TOI, he had not been able to explain where he was between 2.36pm and 4pm — the incident took place around 3pm. Ashish’s three-day police remand ends on Friday, and that of the three others on Sunday. “My client was not in the vehicle,” Ashish’s counsel Avdhesh Kumar Singh said. “With his remand getting over, I will file a bail application on Monday after receiving the case diary. I need to check what charges are being levelled against him by the investigation officer.” Ashish was sent back to judicial custody on Thursday night, nearly 12 hours before his police remand ended. The SIT could, however, seek remand again. “The SIT can reapply within the initial 15-day judicial custody period (which began on Sunday),” senior prosecution officer SP Yadav said. “The SIT has found evidence that Ankit Das was in the black Fortuner while Lateef (his bouncer) had allegedly opened fire while attempting to help Das and others escape after mowing down farmers,” an SIT source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/union-minister-ajay-mishras-son-taken-to-lakhimpur-kheri-to-recreate-the-crime-scene/articleshow/87033556.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||World||Tuberculosis cases reporting in India down by 41% due to Covid: WHO report||GENEVA: Reporting of tuberculosis cases in India went down by 41% between 2019 and 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the WHO’s 2021 global TB report released on Thursday. India, followed by Indonesia (14%), the Philippines (12%) and China (8%) were the top four countries that contributed most to the global reduction in TB notifications between 2019 and 2020. About 16 countries, including these four, together accounted for 93% of the total global drop in notifications. In its yearly report on TB, the UN health agency said 1.5 million people worldwide died of the bacterial disease last year, a slight rise from the 1.4 million deaths in 2019. The increase in TB deaths, the first in more than a decade, occurred mainly in the 30 countries with the highest burden of TB, including India. The report said the number of people newly diagnosed with TB and those reported to national governments fell to 5.8 million in 2020 from 7.1 million in 2019. WHO estimates that some 4.1 million people currently suffer from TB but have not been diagnosed with the disease or have not officially reported to national authorities. This figure is up from 2.9 million in 2019. The report showed that the Covid-19 pandemic reversed years of global progress in tackling TB. There was a reduction in provision of TB preventive treatment: Some 2.8 million people accessed this in 2020, a 21% reduction since 2019. Moreover, 2020 also saw a drop in global investment for TB diagnostic, treatment and prevention services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/tuberculosis-cases-reporting-in-india-down-by-41-due-to-covid-who-report/articleshow/87033604.cms||---
---||World||Sectarian clashes in Beirut amid tensions over inquiry into port explosion; 6 killed||BEIRUT: Six Shias were shot dead in Beirut on Thursday, in an attack on supporters of Hezbollah and an allied Lebanese party who were gathering to demand the removal of the judge investigating last year’s devastating port blast. The shooting, which took place on a frontline of Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war and evoked scenes reminiscent of the conflict, marks the deadliest civil violence in Beirut since 2008. It also highlights a deepening crisis over the probe into the August 2020 explosion that is undermining government efforts to tackle economic meltdown. The Iran-backed Hezbollah and its ally, the Shia Amal Movement, accused the Lebanese Forces (LF), a Christian party that has close ties to Saudi Arabia, of mounting the attack. Interior minister Bassam Mawlawi said snipers had opened fire and aimed at people’s heads. The LF denied any involvement and condemned the violence, which it blamed on Hezbollah “incitement” against Judge Tarek Bitar, the lead investigator into the port blast, which killed 200 people. Coming after repeated warnings from Hezbollah that continuing Bitar’s probe would split the country, the violence may create a pretext to shut down or shelve further investigation into the explosion. President Michel Aoun vowed that those responsible for Thursday’s gunfire would be held accountable. During the attack, local television stations broadcast footage of bullets bouncing off buildings and people running for cover. One of the dead was a woman who was struck by a bullet while in her home, a military source said. At a nearby school, teachers instructed infant children to lie face down on the ground with their hands on their heads, a Reuters witness said. A lifeless body was dragged from the street by bystanders in a footage. The army said in a statement the gunfire had targeted protesters as they passed through the Teyouneh traffic circle located in an area dividing Christian and Shia Muslim neighbourhoods. The shooting began from the Christian neighbourhood of Ain el-Remmaneh, from where the civil war was set off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/sectarian-clashes-in-beirut-amid-tensions-over-inquiry-into-port-explosion-6-killed/articleshow/87033643.cms||---

He was produced before a magistrate’s court, which immediately released him on bail. The BJP demanded the immediate dismissal of the minister following his arrest. But Awhad, the NCP leadership and the Shiv Sena rejected the demand, saying the BJP should first sack union minister Narayan Rane, who too was arrested last month for making derogatory remarks about CM Uddhav Thackeray. This is the first time in recent years that a cabinet minister has been arrested on criminal charges and later released on bail. The CM will take a decision on whether to sack Awhad from the cabinet, since at the moment, he is just an accused and hasn’t been proven guilty, sources said. After Kirit Somaiya demanded his dismissal, Awhad said he did not want to respond to the BJP leader. “I do not respond to Somaiya. I have full faith in the judiciary, the law will take its own course,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/ncp-housing-minister-jitendra-awhad-arrested-for-assault-on-engineer-in-2020-released-on-bail/articleshow/87033673.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Mumbai||All students below 18 will now be allowed on Mumbai local trains||MUMBAI: School and college students who are below 18 years and not eligible for vaccination will now be allowed to board local trains in Mumbai, a move that is expected to hasten the reopening of campuses. The state government on Thursday made a few more inclusions to the category eligible for services restricted to those fully immunised. Besides recipients of both doses of a Covid vaccine (who have completed 14 days since the second), those with a medical condition that does not allow them to take a shot and have a doctor’s certificate to confirm it and those under-18 and not eligible for vaccination will treated on par for access to certain facilities. This includes local train travel, entry into malls, temples (in certain districts), restaurants, auditoriums, wedding halls and multiplexes. The relaxation will specially benefit students of junior colleges to attend classes in person. Some colleges have started science practicals as a prelude to throwing open the campus. Many are keen to begin classroom lessons next week, underscoring the demand to make concessions for student travel by train. According to the state notification, “there will be many people who despite having the intention of getting fully vaccinated are not eligible due to medical conditions or because they are less than 18 years of age and so such persons should be allowed to render or receive such services”. Railway authorities said they will abide by government guidelines. Those under 18 will enjoy this travel concession for up to 60 days from the time their vaccine becomes available. Once vaccine doses are available, they will be required to take their shots to continue having access to trains. Prof Hasnain Naqvi, vice principal of St Xavier’s College, said the decision was much awaited as students and parents, who accompany them from distant suburbs, were being inconvenienced and had to either travel ticketless or use other modes of transport. Commuters have also demanded that railways do away with the compulsion of monthly passes and begin single day ticket sales as well. “Many fully vaccinated people are forced to travel ticketless as the railways are not giving single day tickets,” said Prakash Giri, a resident of Chembur.

---||Mumbai||Covid tally in Mumbai crosses 500 fifth time in October||MUMBAI: For the fifth time this month, the daily Covid tally climbed beyond 500 (546) on Thursday in Mumbai. The city has registered the highest rise in cases in a state where currently 17 districts have less than 100 active cases. “The slight rise in numbers is due to the unlocking process. Since August 16, we have opened up trains, restaurants, schools and places of worship, resulting in crowding and social interactions that could have pushed up transmission,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC daily dashboard showed a marginal increase in the number of critical patients to 323 after dropping below 300 late last week. However, overall bed occupancy for Covid patients in the city is still around 10.46% and ICU occupancy has been steady at 25% for weeks now. Overall, Maharashtra continued to report under 2,500 cases for the sixth consecutive day. The state reported 2,384 cases and 35 deaths, taking total cases to 65.8 lakh and deaths to 1,39,705. Although the caseload in Maharashtra has increased corresponding to Mumbai’s figures, state task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said, “We are in a better space right now, but it is too soon to expect cases to drop to zero.” Overall caseload for Mumbai region on Thursday was 998. Active cases in Mumbai increased to 6,212 while active cases in the state is under 30,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-tally-in-mumbai-crosses-500-fifth-time-in-october/articleshow/87033719.cms||---

This month, Gurgaon has recorded four ‘satisfactory’ air days so far, while no ‘satisfactory’ days were reported in the corresponding period in 2020. The graded response action plan (GRAP) will be imposed in the region from Friday. Gurgaon has seen a single ‘poor’ AQI day this October so far. In comparison, three ‘poor’ air days were recorded in October last year. Moreover, a total of nine ‘moderate’ days have been reported this time, while the number stood at 11 last year. According to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), imposing pre-GRAP measures from the start of October has helped improve air quality this time. “This year, we have opted for the ‘prevention is better than cure’ policy and it has helped us maintain better air quality. We have been carrying out night patrolling to curb waste burning activities,” said Kuldeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer, Gurgaon. Even as the region’s air quality is in the ‘moderate’ range, the city will be implementing GRAP measures to mitigate air pollution from Friday, which will include stopping garbage burning and imposing heavy fines on violators, enforcing pollution control regulations in brick kilns and industries, periodic mechanised sweeping on roads with heavy traffic and water sprinkling on unpaved roads every two days. Strict vigilance will be undertaken and there will be no tolerance for visible emissions as visibly polluting vehicles will be banned by impounding or heavy fines, HSPCB officials said. The measures also include enforcing dust control rules in construction activities, shutting down non-compliant sites and deploying traffic police for smooth traffic flow at identified vulnerable areas. “We have already started water sprinkling on roads where construction activities are being carried out. On Thursday, we sprinkled water on Mahavir Chowk where construction is going on as it is one of Gurgaon's major dust-generating stretches. We will take all required measures from October 15 (Friday),” said Subhash Yadav, nodal officer of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon’s environment and sustainability wing. Meanwhile, the air quality is likely to deteriorate in the coming days as the temperature in the region is expected to rise. On Thursday, the city’s overall AQI stood at 172. Three stations out of four reported ‘satisfactory’ AQI. The AQI was 152 at Gwalpahari station, 146 at Vikas Sadan, 184 at Teri Gram and 210 at Sector 51. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’ and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/octs-air-better-than-last-year-grap-to-kick-in-today/articleshow/87031569.cms||Ipsita Pati

Khattar, who was presiding over a video conference with divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners from Chandigarh headquarters, sought details of the arterial roads and national highways in the city that sustained damages during monsoon and directed the administration to expedite repair work on all affected stretches. “The CM issued clear instructions that all the road construction agencies should prepare their schedule and ensure repair of all the broken roads by November 30,” deputy commissioner Yash Garg said. Khattar also discussed issues like stubble burning and timely availability of fertilizers to the farmers at the meeting, officials said. Meanwhile, officials from the public works department and Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) said they have commenced repair works and would complete the same within the stipulated time. A PWD official told TOI that repair work on a 36.82-km stretch of state highways, major district roads (20.19 km), and other district roads (about 192 km) has already commenced and was expected to be completed by November 15. Over 88 roads, covering a total area of about 234 km, in the district fall under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Marketing Board.

Adjourning the matter for October 26, the HC also hinted that it could start a day-to-day hearing of the case after the Dussehra vacations. During the resumed hearing of the case before the HC on Thursday, the counsel representing former Punjab DGP submitted that the opening of the sealed-cover reports is not relevant at present and there are several other issues that need to be addressed by the bench. ‘If sealed reports not opened, it would be a total tragedy'However, senior advocate Anupam Gupta reacted strongly and expressed complete disagreement with former DGP Shashi Kant’s stand on the issue, saying that it would be a “total tragedy.” “There may be a million other issues in this case, but the principal issue would be the sealed-cover reports prepared by various agencies as they relate to the culpability of people in high places. If the sealed reports are not opened, it would be a total tragedy. The dominant issue in the case would be culpability of people in high political places,” Gupta argued. He also contended that the bench may agree or disagree with contents of the reports but eports should be opened. The senior counsel also suggested that the bench should go through the May 2018 order of this case, as the order would clarify the entire issue. Now, the matter would come up for hearing after the Dussehra vacations in the high court. The matter is related to the drug menace in Punjab. Importantly, former DGP (jails), Punjab, Shashi Kant had written a letter to the high court alleging nexus of politicians with drug lords in Punjab. In an application submitted before the HC on September 10, 2013, Shashi Kant claimed that drug smuggling worth over Rs 6,000 crore took place annually in Punjab and the money went into funding the elections in the state. The former DGP had also submitted that drugs were not just being smuggled from Pakistan but also manufactured in Punjab. The HC had clubbed all these applications and constituted a special division bench to hear the cases related to drugs in Punjab. During the hearing of the case, a large number of periodical reports were also filed by several agencies before the HC about the action taken against the accused involved in the drug haul case||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/drug-haul-case-will-examine-reports-in-sealed-covers-punjab-and-haryana-high-court/articleshow/87033759.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: At Pimpalgaon, tomato price up from Rs 2.5/kg to Rs 25 in 40 days||NASHIK: Tomato prices are pinching the pockets of citizens with the rate of the kitchen staple shooting up dramatically in just 40 days. From an average wholesale rate of Rs 2.5 a kg in the first week of September, tomatoes are now selling at Rs 25 a kg at Pimpalgaon market in Nashik district, the country’s largest tomato wholesale market. In the retail markets of the state, tomatoes are selling at a steep Rs 50-60 a kg in Pune, Rs 60 a kg in Nashik, Rs 100 in Kolhapur and Rs 80 in Mumbai. Heavy rainfall in September and the Gulab cyclone left hectares of fields damaged in the Nashik and Kolhapur regions. An estimated 10 lakh farmers cultivate tomatoes in Nashik district alone, making up for almost 20% of the country’s production. “Currently, the daily arrival of tomatoes at the Pimpalgaon agriculture produce market committee is around 1.70 lakh crates (20 kg a crate) per day. During the same period last year, we would get 3.5 lakh crates a day. The drop in supply as compared to demand has led to a rise in wholesale tomato prices,” said Deepak Gavli, who looks after tomato sales at the Pimpalgaon APMC. Gavli said around 50% of the tomato crop in Nashik district has been hit due to the recent heavy rain. “Now, the new tomato fruits in the existing plantation will come in very low quantity. Hence, the supply will continue to dip further,” he said. Wholesale tomato prices leap to Rs 22/kg in 40 daysBhikchand Parakh, a tomato trader, said the price trend of tomatoes will be upward and the situation will come under control only after the new crops start arriving after three weeks. Farmers who dumped their tomatoes on the roads after the fall in prices in September are ruing their stance. Somnath Kulagi, farmer from Jat tehsil of Sangli district, had dumped his tomatoes outside the mandi after the wholesale prices dropped to Rs 1.5 per kg. Now, he is getting calls from traders asking if he has any produce in the farm. Kulagi had destroyed his entire tomato crop and taken up chilli cultivation. “It was for the first time that I suffered heavy losses. Now when I see that the tomatoes are fetching such a good price, I feel my decision to destroy the crop was wrong. I would have made up for the loss I faced then,” he told TOI. Zuber, a vegetable vendor in Kolhapur, said they get most of the tomato supply from Shirol, Sangli and Solapur regions. Due to the floods, the farm produce has been impacted in Sangli and Shirol. The farmers from Solapur region are sending their produce to Mumbai, affecting supply to the southern Maharashtra city. Navnath Chavan, a farmer from Lasur in Aurangabad district, said the recent rain fury had damaged tomato cultivation to a major extent. “I had cultivated tomato crop over 15 gunthas, majority of which was destroyed. Whatever produce could be harvested is now being sold by farmers with minimal profit,” he said. Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) president Jagannath Kale said that besides the natural calamity, the rise in diesel prices is also partially responsible for rise in prices of tomatoes and other vegetables. Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section at the market yard, Gultkedi, Pune, said, the arrival of tomato has decreased as many plantations have been badly affected. Moreover, the demand is high as many hotels, restaurants, eateries and food giants have reopened to full capacity. “Considering these factors, the rates will remain high at least for the next few weeks,” he said. Satish Pote, a tomato grower from Narayangaon near Pune, said that the adverse weather condition impacted the plantation badly and the tomatoes are not up to the standard. “There are very few growers who are able to reap good returns from the present market rates,” he said.

The I-T department advised taxpayers to file their returns for the last financial year at the earliest and suggested that those filing returns should check TDS and payment details to avail of the pre-filing facility. Besides, it said that e-proceedings and faceless proceedings have been enabled with functionalities, including video conferencing for assessment and seeking adjournments or appointments and filings by authorised representatives. “Taxpayers have been able to view over 12.2 lakh notices issued by the department under the faceless assessment/appeal/penalty proceedings, to which over 6.2 lakh responses have been filed,” it said. Since its launch in early June, taxpayers and practitioners had complained of major glitches, prompting FM Nirmala Sitharaman to take up the issue with Infosys, the vendor for the new portal. The problems had forced the government to postpone the deadline for filing of returns and other compliances. With things seemingly stabilising, the ministry’s annoyance with the technology major too seemed to have reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finance-ministry-over-2-crore-tax-returns-filed-on-new-portal/articleshow/87033812.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Punjab’s power crisis: 3 units shut down, load reduced in 8||PATIALA: Punjab’s power crisis continued on Thursday amid coal shortage that led to the closure of two units of Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) and one unit of Lehra Mohabbat. The power cuts were imposed on various category consumers but were less in comparison to the last four days. Eight of the 10 running units had to operate at reduced load thus generating about 3,000MW on Thursday afternoon. The hydropower generation is around 440MW. The coal stock with TSPL is around two days, while NPL and GVK power plants have 1.5 days of coal stock. The TSPL officials claimed that around one lakh MT of coal is in transit. The NPL officials said they have 42,000MT of coal available with them so far. The GVK officials revealed that around 10,000MT of coal was available in the plant while 20,000MT of coal was in transit. Sources revealed that on Wednesday the power plants in Punjab received 10 rakes of coal while 49 rakes were in transit. Sources also said the power from Tata Mundra may be available by Friday as one of its five 800MW units at Mundra started on Wednesday to power up Gujarat and Punjab. The first unit gives 600MW to Gujarat and 160MW to Punjab. The second unit will come up by Thursday night and the third by Saturday morning. The Ranjit Sagar Dam project has started its operation and is generating about 120MW. On Wednesday restricted power supply in the state was 1952 lakh units and the demand was 2005 lakh units. PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said PSPCL has met maximum power demand of 9,363MW in the state on Wednesday while the PSPCL had to purchase around 1,500MW of power from power exchange at a rate of Rs.11.29 per unit on Thursday. He said only 10 coal rakes of coal were received against the requirement of 22 rakes. “There has been a noticeable change in weather as the temperatures have started a downward trend. Agricultural demand has also started to recede and consequently, the power demand has also started to decline and will considerably reduce within the next two to three days. The power supply position has shown marked improvement as adequate agriculture supply was provided and the quantum of power cuts were very nominal yesterday. The supply position is likely to improve further as no power cuts are likely to be imposed in coming days,” said the CMD. Director Generation PSPCL, Paramjeet Singh said, “We got 100 MW power from Mundra on Thursday as only one unit works. From tomorrow we might get 475 MW. ” PSERC must look into violations All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) in a letter to Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) has urged it to intervene as there are gross violations of power purchase agreement (PPA) between Tata power and PSPCL. They said the PSPCL is procuring electricity at a rate higher than the PPA rate and there was no basis to bypass the PSERC. They urged that PSPCL should take legal opinion on such matters of PPAs, as it has been already decided by the Supreme Court. The AIPEF said the move could reduce pressure on domestic coal and help bring down prices on power exchanges. “For 475 MW, it will cost Rs 3 crore daily to PSPCL and ultimately to consumers. Punjab’s own power generation cost is around Rs 4 per unit and its coal-fired power plants are operating at low capacity due to domestic coal shortage, resulting in power outages and restrictions on consumers. Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana are among the five consumers of the Mundra project that stopped operations as imported coal prices touched $150 per tonne,” AIPEF said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/punjabs-power-crisis-3-units-shut-down-load-reduced-in-8/articleshow/87033806.cms||---
---||Noida||Ghaziabad police constable found using car with ‘fake number’, under scanner||NOIDA: An enquiry has been instituted after a head constable, posted with the Ghaziabad police, was allegedly found using a stolen Scorpio car with a fake number plate, police said. A complaint was submitted with Greater Noida police by the owner of a car who claimed to have received several challans for the Scorpio since 2019. No FIR has been registered in the matter so far. Complainant Sachin Kumar, who owns a Mahindra Scorpio car (UP16BC0827), has claimed that he received several challans against the vehicle on his number. “I got this Scorpio at the time of my wedding but since 2019, I started receiving messages about the challans I am supposed to pay. I received two challans – one for dangerous parking and another for not wearing a seat belt,” he alleged. The first challan was issued in October 2019 and the second in December 2019 against the name of Preeti Baisoya, a resident of Noida’s Sector 46, he said in the complaint. “I was alarmed to see the messages about the challans but ignored them. However, on Sunday, I received a message stating that my Scorpio had been brought for repair at the Koncept Automobiles Private Limited service centre in Kasna. I was shocked because I was in Vrindavan at that time and I had my Scorpio with me. I called up the service centre and asked them to hold the vehicle they were repairing,” he claimed. When Kumar reached the centre the next day, he found that the Scorpio parked at the centre had the same number on the plate (UP16BC0827) as his vehicle. Kumar submitted a complaint at Accher police chowki but it was allegedly not received. “I also went to the Beta II police station, but the cops did not listen to me. Later, I got to know that the Scorpio was in possession of head constable Balraj Singh who had been posted in Greater Noida,” he said. Kumar later shared a video of the stolen car parked at the service centre, which was brought there by the head constable’s son, and his own car. On Thursday, Greater Noida police said when they informed their Ghaziabad counterpart, the latter shared a statement stating that the car was brought to the Kavi Nagar police station on June 1, 2020, as an unclaimed vehicle and was auctioned off on September 28, 2021, to a scrap dealer, Sarwar Ali. It added that the engine and the chassis number on the vehicle were “unreadable”. As per information from the available registration number, the car belongs to one Raj Kumar of Delhi’s Rohini. Circle Officer Kavi Nagar Anshu Jain, who is inquiring into the case, told TOI that they have questioned the head constable. “The chassis number of the car was unreadable. It has been found that the car was with the head constable. I will submit my enquiry report accordingly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/cop-found-using-car-with-fake-number-under-scanner/articleshow/87031768.cms||Shikha Salaria

The sensex has recorded a new high every day of the holiday-shortened week, gaining over 1,200 points in four sessions. The broader Nifty, which crossed the 18k milestone on Monday, also hit a new closing high at 18,339, gaining 177 points (1%) on Thursday. IT stocks joined the rally, which was led by auto, energy, metals and financial sectors this week, bolstered by betterthan-expected Q2 results for Wipro and Infosys. Depreciation of the rupee, which fell below 75 against the dollar this week, too supported the rally in IT stocks, according to market players. A combination of macroeconomic factors, global cues and strong earnings has supported the bullish momentum on Dalal Street, market analysts said. Investors are also expecting strong sales for carmakers in the festive season, which has led to the auto sector being the top gainer, rising nearly 7%, this week. “Markets are in a festive mood and witnessing faster sector rotation. IT was in limelight after strong numbers from Infosys, Wipro and Mindtree. The earning season has started on a strong note and needs to continue delivering strong numbers for the market to sustain the current momentum,” said Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 22 closed in the green on Thursday, with ITC, HDFC Bank and PowerGrid being the top gainers. The HDFC twins and ICICI Bank alone contributed 364 points to the sensex’s 569-point sprint on Thursday. Foreign investors were net buyers with Rs 1,596 crore inflows on Thursday, according to NSDL data. “The market continued its bull run as worries about the likely interest rate hike in the US at a later stage and rising bond yields tempered,” said Kotak Securities head (equity research - retail) Shrikant Chouhan. The market capitalisation of the BSE too hit a fresh high at Rs 275 lakh crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-goes-past-61k-as-festive-mood-grips-d-st/articleshow/87033847.cms||Aseem Gujar

Breaking his silence after almost a month since the boardroom war began, Goenka questioned the intention of Invesco for not making public a proposed deal with RIL earlier. “Why didn’t Invesco make its plans public earlier?... Does good corporate governance only apply to corporates and not their institutional investors?” Goenka said. Invesco, along with OFI Global China Fund LLC, holds nearly 18% in Zee and has been pressing for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to discuss various issues, including the removal of Goenka and appointment of its nominees on the company’s board. According to Goenka, the fight with Invesco is to ensure Zee continues to gain growth opportunities and become a stronger player in the media and entertainment sector. Goenka said that he would not let anyone impact the future of Zee or diminish the shareholder value it has been consistently generating over the years. “All I am contending for is to preserve the future of this company, and not my position,” he said. Goenka said the deal negotiated with Reliance, which however could not be fructified, was advanced by Invesco, and later he presented the fact before the Zee board to “bring the truth out in the interest of all our stakeholders”. “I acknowledge the stance that has been taken by Invesco but communications pertaining to such proposals are always well-documented, and they speak to the contrary. I too have a lot of points to put across, but I firmly believe that there is a right time and place for it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-asks-why-invesco-didnt-make-its-plans-public-earlier/articleshow/87033894.cms||---

The deal got mired in legal tangles on matters of valuation. Sebi last month approached the Supreme Court against the Securities Appellate Tribunal’s order in the matter, which is pending before the apex court. “At a meeting held today, the board has decided not to proceed with the preferential issue and the share subscription agreements executed with the proposed allottees have been terminated in accordance with their respective terms,” PNB Housing Finance said in a regulatory filing.

---||Business||September wholesale inflation dips to 6-month low||NEW DELHI: Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) slipped to a six-month low of 10.66% in September, from 11.4% in August, due to a moderation in the food segment, but edible oil, petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices remained elevated. The level in September is the lowest reading since April, when WPI inflation was estimated at 10.74%, latest data released by the government on Thursday showed. Inflation was estimated at 1.3% in September last year. The trend is in line with retail inflation, which moderated to a five-month low of 4.4% in September. For the government, the big comfort factor will be food articles which witnessed a 4.7% decline with vegetable prices falling over 32%, the sharpest decline since the 2011-12 series was introduced. Pulses, where inflation hovered around 9.4%, and edible oil are two household items which will be a major concern for the government. Although the pace of increase in the vegetable and animal oils and fats moderated for the fourth straight month, it still grew at a worrisome pace of nearly 37% in September. But it was petroleum products that are causing the maximum grief to consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/september-wholesale-inflation-dips-to-6-month-low/articleshow/87033936.cms||---

---||Business||Trade deficit at new high on oil, gold, silver||NEW DELHI: India’s trade deficit widened to a monthly record of $22.6 billion during September on soaring imports of gold, silver and crude petroleum and a moderation in the pace of export growth. The trade deficit estimated in September 2021 eclipsed the previous high of $20.2 billion reported in October 2012. Latest numbers released by the commerce and industry ministry on Thursday pegged exports at $33.7 billion, 22.6% higher than a year ago, while imports shot up almost 85% to $56.4 billion. What contributed to the massive increase in imports was a threefold jump in the value of crude oil imports, which increased from $5.8 billion in September 2020 to $17.4 billion in September this year. This was partly due to higher prices as well as increased consumption on the back of higher economic activity. The other major contributor was gold, where imports shot up eight-and-a-half times to $5.1 billion in September 2021 with prices again playing a major role. Similarly, silver shipments, which had slumped last year, were estimated to have soared 60 times to $552 million in September. Coal and coke imports too remained high, rising 83% to $2.2 billion, moderately higher than the 78% growth during the first half of the fiscal year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trade-deficit-at-new-high-on-oil-gold-silver/articleshow/87033949.cms||---

The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors also said in a communique issued after a meeting in Washington that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should establish a new trust fund to channel a $650-billion issuance of its monetary reserves to a broader range of vulnerable countries. The finance leaders noted in their statement that economic recovery “remains highly divergent across and within countries” and is vulnerable to new variants of Covid and an uneven pace of vaccinations. “We will continue to sustain the recovery, avoiding any premature withdrawal of support measures, while preserving financial stability and longterm fiscal sustainability, and safeguarding against downside risks and negative spillovers,” the G20 finance leaders said in the statement. Given rising inflation pressures driven by supply chain bottlenecks and shortages as economies struggle to normalise, the leaders said that central banks are “monitoring current price dynamics closely”. ‘India offers spectrum of opportunities’India offers a spectrum of opportunities to investors and business firms, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told executives of top American companies as she met and apprised them of various flagship programmes of the Indian government under Atma Nirbhar Bharat.

This is the first time in years that a jackal has claimed a human life in Madhya Pradesh. The victim, 45-year-old Kaluram Ahirwar, lived in Harrakheda of Gunga, around 30km from Bhopal. Around a week ago, he and his family members were harvesting maize crops in their fields and didn’t notice a jackal lurking in the bushes, said Gunga SHO Ramesh Rai. Without apparent provocation, it bit Kaluram in the elbow. He cleaned it with water and brushed it off as a freak experience. The pain wasn’t severe, so he thought nothing of it and did not seek medical treatment in time, said police. He couldn’t have known it would be fatal. Days later, the wound showed signs of infection. His family admitted him to Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, but his condition kept deteriorating. In desperation, they tried to shift him to another hospital on Thursday but he died before admission. Police are waiting for the autopsy report. The forest department is trying to track down the jackal to see if it’s carrying any infection and to ensure that it doesn’t attack anyone else.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-bitten-by-jackal-man-dies-a-week-later-in-gunga/articleshow/87033898.cms||Sudeept Mishra
---||Gurgaon||Told to vacate for repairs, say Green View residents||Gurgaon: Some residents of NBCC Green View, a residential society in Sector 37D, are in a fix after they received a notice from the developer to vacate their flats by November 10. The residents claimed the developer has adopted a completely “illegal and inhumane attitude” and threatened them with suspension of essential services like electricity and water supply if they don’t vacate the property. This comes after an IIT Delhi report issued earlier this year pointed out several structural defects in the society buildings, which require repairs. The developer, NBCC, issued the notice on Wednesday. It had earlier issued a similar notice on October 3 giving residents 15 days’ time to vacate the flats to carry out “comprehensive repair work”. According to an NBCC representative, the structures are exhibiting concrete spalling (breaking or cracking of concrete) at several locations due to presence of chlorides and the issues are quality-related only. “Comprehensive repair work is being carried out as per the recommendations of IIT Delhi. NBCC will provide all possible support for temporary relocation and residents will be duly compensated,” the representative said. There is, however, no fixed deadline for the repairs. “A deadline will be worked out in consultation with experts and will be known after some time,” the representative added. Launched in 2010, the project is spread across 18 acres. Possession of flats started in August 2017 after a delay of over two years. The society has 923 flats, including 139 EWS flats. So far, 260 flats have been sold and more than 150 families are residing here. Residents have demanded that the developer immediately withdraw the notice and give full refunds of the total cost of the flats along with interest. G Mohanty, president of NBCC Green View Association of Apartment Owners (AOAO), said the developer has left them in the lurch. “The developer has adopted a completely illegal and inhumane attitude and is doing things without any consideration for residents. We are facing several issues like shoddy construction and poor workmanship and maintenance. We asked the developer to return our money, but they didn’t pay any heed to us, instead serving us notices to vacate our registered property without any action plan,” he said. Yadvender Yadav, a resident, added, “We are the owners, and yet they want us to pack our bags and move out. We are being harassed by NBCC officials, who are knocking at our doors and telling us to vacate the flat in a threatening tone, saying that otherwise they will suspend essential services such as electricity and water supply.” Other residents said they noticed several flaws in construction within a month of moving in and made several complaints to the developer and the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. They also filed a complaint with the central vigilance commission, which has conducted an intensive enquiry on the matter, they claimed. Randhir Singh, the AOAO general secretary, said: “Following our complaint, the builder hired IIT Delhi to conduct a structural audit of the building, which proved our doubts to be right and pointed out several defects. Now, they want to repair the buildings, but it is beyond repair. We want our money back with interest, along with the cost of registration and interiors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/told-to-vacate-for-repairs-say-green-view-residents/articleshow/87031257.cms||Akanksha Gupta

While demand remains robust as the market comes out of the second wave of the coronavirus blues, companies have been handicapped to service the order surge as absence of critical semiconductors have resulted in massive shortfall at dealerships. According to wholesale delivery data of cars dispatched to dealerships, there has been a decline in volumes with below-par production levels at factories of companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors and Mahindra. According to numbers released by industry body Siam, small car and sedan deliveries in September — a month before the beginning of the festive sale period — stood at 64,235 units, a 61% fall over the 1.6 lakh units dispatched in the same month last year. For SUVs and UVs, the fall was 9% on total dispatches of 87,720 units against 96,633 units in September last year. The waiting lists on cars and SUVs currently range between a few weeks and over six months for many models. These include some of the popular ones, such as, Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Tata Nexon, Mahindra Thar and Maruti Swift. Maruti, the country’s top carmaker, said its factory output in October could be down by as much as 40%, this being yet another month of short supplies after it had to cut output by 60% in September. “Many members have curtailed production plans. Coupled with the festive demand, this has led to long waiting time for the customers on popular models,” Kenichi Ayukawa, MD & CEO of Maruti Suzuki who is also the president of Siam, said. Even the two-wheeler market remains under pressure, not that much by semiconductor shortage but due to poor demand in the entry segment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shortage-of-chips-stretches-waiting-period-for-new-cars/articleshow/87034007.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Bhopal||Honey-trap case: Armyman posted in MP held from Haryana for passing on info to ISI||BHOPAL: Yet another Armyman posted in Madhya Pradesh has been arrested by central intelligence agencies for allegedly sharing classified information with Pakistan after being caught in an ISI honey trap. Rohit Kumar, posted in Bhopal, was arrested from his native village, Kodwa, in Ambala district of Haryana on Wednesday, said police. This is the second such incident in MP in around two and a half years. In May 2019, a jawan posted in Mhow was arrested by MP anti-terrorist squad (ATS) and a central intelligence agency after being honeytrapped on social media. Kumar had received money in his father’s bank account for the information he passed on, say Investigators. At least three transactions have been traced, they say, adding that he was in touch with two Pakistanis, including the woman who lured him. “Inputs on ORBAT (order of battle), training and unit locations were shared. He is being questioned by intelligence officers,” said an officer, adding that he was under close watch since his last posting in an active area. Interestingly, the honeytrapped Mhow jawan’s last posting was in the same area. Kumar was trapped after responding to a woman’s ‘friend request’ on social media, and shared information believing she was Indian, said the officer. He has been charged under Official Secrecy Act (OSA). Military Intelligence (MI) officers say that several advisories have been issued to soldiers, cautioning them against Pakistan supported ‘call centres’ but some still fall prey. On Wednesday, in fact, there was a second such arrest -- an Armyman posted in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur was taken into custody. He too was honey trapped, and police have found crucial information on his phone, say sources. The MI Directorate had issued a warning against specific social media profiles like ‘Oyesomya’ on Instagram and ‘Gujjar Soumya’ on Facebook. The ‘Gujjar Soumya’ profile claims to be an IIT-Bombay research scholar and the sister of a martyred captain. Many such profiles have been flagged by IB, MI and RAW in the last two years. The jawan arrested in Mhow had been lured into explicit sex chats, allegedly in exchange for critical military information. Interrogation revealed that a woman struck up a friendship with him on WhatsApp through a spoofed caller ID using an Indian name. “These call centres use trained women to make explicit calls and sex chats. Once a jawan accepts their request, they start coaxing him into sharing sensitive information. If the soldier gets suspicious, they come up with offers of money or simply blackmail them with the threat to expose them,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/honey-trap-case-armyman-posted-in-mp-held-from-haryana-for-passing-on-info-to-isi/articleshow/87034006.cms||P Naveen
---||Indore||Two workers die in LPG tank at IOCL plant in Madhya Pradesh after ‘fall’||UJJAIN: Two labourers were killed in an underground LPG collection tank at Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL)’s Nazarpur bottling plant in Ghatia, around 100km from Ujjain, on Thursday. How the accident happened is yet to be established. Officials are tight-lipped. One of the theories is that they accidentally fell into a 100-ft-long and 12-ft deep tank. Another is that they got asphyxiated while cleaning it. Lakhan Singh, 30 and Rajendra Singh, 27, worked for a contractor employed by the IOCL, and were cleaning the area around the tank. One of them probably slipped through the small opening, and the other man was dragged in trying to save him, official sources said. “We are trying to recover the bodies. Both of them were residents of Ghatia and working on contract,” SDM Govind Dubey told TOI. The tank is used to empty LPG from tankers. IOCL sources said rescue and recovery efforts were hampered by the highly inflammable nature of LPG. They are wary of using equipment as metal could create sparks, which would be devastating. The tank is being emptied first, which itself is an extremely difficult job because LPG vaporizes instantly and could be dangerous even in residual amounts. Senior administrative officials, fire brigade and a disaster management team are on the site. They are going through CCTV footage to find out how the accident happened. GAIL summons technical teams from Guna, Godhra to empty the container A large crowd of villagers has gathered at the IOCL plant, demanding to know the status of the recovery of bodies. Police have been deployed in strength to prevent any flare-up. Ujjain SP Satyendra Shukla said that technical teams from IOCL have been summoned from Vijaypur (near Guna, MP, 220 kilometres away) and Godhra (Gujarat, 300 kilometres away) to empty the container. “It is very risky to work near the LPG storage area and it requires technical expertise to avoid any mishap,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/two-workers-die-in-lpg-tank-at-iocl-plant-in-madhya-pradesh-after-fall/articleshow/87033781.cms||---

Without the increase in the debt ceiling, the US Treasury had estimated it would run out of money to pay the nation's bills on Oct. 18. The $480 billion increase in the borrowing limit signed by Biden is expected to be exhausted by December 3. Following weeks of partisan fighting, the Senate approved the short-term fix last week and the House of Representatives passed it on Tuesday. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell wrote in a letter to Biden after the Senate vote that he would not help Democrats again in raising the debt limit. McConnell wants Democrats to use a procedural move known as reconciliation, which would not require Republican votes, to raise the borrowing authority. Democrats have rejected that as an option for lifting the cap. Republicans say raising the debt limit is Democrats' problem because of Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion spending plan to invest in expanded social services and address climate change. Democrats note that they voted to raise the debt ceiling during Republican Donald Trump's administration even though they opposed deep tax cuts that added to the debt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-signs-bill-raising-us-debt-limit-averting-default/articleshow/87034103.cms||---

Officials said that a month-long campaign on vector-borne diseases would also start from Monday. Meanwhile, with over 60 cases being recorded from several villages of Muradnagar, it has emerged as the biggest cluster of dengue cases in the district. Officials said they have deployed medical teams in the area’s primary health centres that are conducting camps and identifying dengue and malaria patients. Fogging and anti-larvae activities are also going on, they added. As many as 14 new cases were reported on Thursday, taking the total number of cases to 561. The official data revealed that 249 cases have been reported in October alone. Moreover, of the 561 patients, 361 needed hospitalisation. Altogether, 1,870 people were tested for dengue fever. There are also 16 malaria cases and 39 scrub typhus cases in Ghaziabad. Despite Thursday being a holiday, chief medical officer Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar reviewed the dengue situation in the district with the health officials. He said various measures were discussed in the meeting to curb the further spread of the infection. “Moreover, officials were assigned duties for the upcoming one-month long communicable disease control campaign. We will collaborate with schools and residential welfare associations in this drive. A survey has been planned in the entire district from October 18,” the CMO added. As far as Muradnagar is concerned, Dr Shankhdhar said that a five-day survey has been going on in nine villages of Muradnagar area. During this, fever patients are being identified and are being sent to the health centers for examination and treatment. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta informed that two additional lab technicians have been appointed at all primary health centers in Muradnagar area so that people do not face inconvenience in getting dengue tests done. Medical camps are also being set up in the area, through which fever patients are being examined. Surveillance has also been increased in the area, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/with-dengue-cases-nearing-600-steps-being-chalked-out-for-month-long-drive/articleshow/87031524.cms||Aditya Dev

No fresh advisory has been issued for industries and according to officials at the power department, Thursday’s demand was 360MW. On Wednesday, it was 380MW. “The supply was normal and we did not have to resort to any rostering during the day. The demand on Thursday was 360MW, which is less than Wednesday’s demand. This was expected as commercial and industrial activities are limited now. We did not issue any advisory for any industry,” said Sarnath Ganguly, the general manager, Noida Power Company Limited (NPCL) that provides electricity to Greater Noida. On Wednesday, the industrial sectors in the city faced some shortage in supply and a rotational rostering system was implemented for about two hours between 6.30 pm and midnight. Residents of Greater Noida have been facing outages because of a deficit in electricity supply linked to coal shortage in plants and the state government has decided to take private help to augment supply. For the past few days, NPCL had been scheduling daytime rostering of about one hour for urban areas and two-three three hours for the rural areas of Greater Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/no-rostering-of-electricity-for-1st-time-in-6-days/articleshow/87031537.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

He said he wanted to tell the Congress leaders that Mandi meant Mandi parliamentary constituency right from Kinnaur to Bharmaur and Rampur. While addressing an election rally at Chhatri under Seraj assembly constituency, he said, “When Congress leaders go to Mandi, they say that work was done only in Seraj and when they come to Seraj, they say that development has not happened in Seraj.” While seeking votes for BJP candidate Brigadier Khushal Thakur from Mandi parliamentary seat, the CM that if the Congress was trying to gain sympathy on the demise of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, then BJP too has lost its MP Ramswaroop Sharma. Addressing an election rally in Choulthach of Seraj assembly constituency in favour of Khushal Thakur, the chief minister again attacked the Congress leadership and said Seraj should get a lead of 40,000 votes this time. “Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh remained in power in Himachal Pradesh for a long time. Ideologically we used to remain face to face, but our fight was never like this. He has always praised me. He also spoke about my decency,” he said, adding that Congress candidate from Mandi parliamentary seat Pratibha Singh had been repeatedly saying that she did not want to contest by-elections. “I want to say from this platform that we need strong MP, not a forced MP.” The CM also counted the development work done by his government in Seraj assembly constituency. He said he was the MLA of Seraj first and later became state’s chief minister and as an elected representative, it was his responsibility to serve the people of Seraj first. Jai Ram Thakur said the Congress government was in the country and the state for a long time. “Today our friends are accusing of unemployment and inflation. All inflation and unemployment did not come in the last four years. We are doing what we can to provide jobs. The previous Congress governments should be asked what you people have done for the poor,” he said. He added that his government gave pension to the elderly women who have attained the age of 65 years and also started ‘Himcare’ scheme for the poor, under which 1.75 lakh poor were treated in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/need-strong-not-forced-mp-hp-cm-on-pratibha-singh/articleshow/87031543.cms||---

International organisations have acknowledged the disease. HAU vice-chancellor B R Kamboj congratulated the scientists and asked them to work for disease management. He said the institute’s scientists will do genetic research for the containment and prevention of this disease. American Phytopathological Society (APS), which declares the new plant diseases, has published the Indian discovery in its journal ‘Plant Diseases’ as first research on this topic. The APS is one of the oldest international scientific organisations for the study of plant diseases. The HAU’s report about the stem rot disease in millet is based on observations from Kharif season 2018. It took three years to identify the disease, which has affected 70% of the state’s millet crop, in Hisar, Bhiwani, and Rewari mainly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hau-first-to-identify-global-millet-disease/articleshow/87031567.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Rathore questions hike in cement prices||Shimla: Congress state president Kuldeep Singh Rathore has questioned the increase in the price of cement during the election. He alleged that cement companies give donation for the election and that by accommodating their demands, the burden is passed on to the public. He also asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to name four major developmental works carried out by it in the state in the last four years. While interacting with the journalists at Dharamshala on Thursday, Kuldeep Singh Rathore said it is surprising that whenever elections are announced, the prices of cement increases in the state. He said state government claims that it has no control over the cement prices or the prices of petrol and diesel. “If government has no control on anything, then question arises whether government do exist,” he added. According to him, BJP makes tall claims when it comes to development and he dared the ruling party to name four developmental projects executed by it. “In the last four years, we have failed to witness any developmental activity in the state,” he alleged, adding that no new institution, college, school, hospital, road or any other developmental work was started in last four years. He said BJP should look into its vision document released during 2017 assembly election and see how many promises made in that document have actually been made a reality. He said not even a single poll promise has been fulfilled by BJP since coming to power in the state. He said prices of essential commodities are constantly increasing and common people are finding it hard to run their kitchen. He said like petrol and diesel, even the prices of LPG has increased manifold. He also said law and order situation is in bad shape and illicit drug trade is on rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rathore-questions-hike-in-cement-prices/articleshow/87031599.cms||---

---||India||Times Face-off: Following the recent attacks in J&K, many raised the spectre of the 1990s. Is it back to those days or is the Centre’s policy paying off?||For: Ram MadhavRecent killings alarming but political discourse has shifted to developmentWhat is the objective of the Union government in Jammu & Kashmir? Lt Governor Manoj Sinha has summed it up beautifully: “The objective is not to buy peace but establish it”. Terrorism, separatism, violence and anti-national activities of civilian and political activists have plagued the state for decades, leaving people fearful and the administration in paralysis. They hampered civil life, development activity and normal political process. Response of the governments in the past has been essentially to manage the conflict and buy peace. Never was there the courage to root out the problem. When the Modi government decided to take on these forces by uprooting their very raison d’etre —Article 370—in August 2019, there were apprehensions all around. Opposition leaders predicted a bloodbath. Some of them hoped that there would be a massive outburst of popular anger on the streets of J&K. But nothing of that sort happened. The Valley remained peaceful. The few protests that did happen in the immediate aftermath of August 5, 2019 were handled by security forces with utmost sensitivity resulting in not a single civilian casualty. People in J&K had experienced life under Article 370 for seven decades. They now seemed open to experiencing life without it. Abrogation of Article 370 has helped in sharper security operations resulting in greater success in anti-terror operations. A study undertaken by Soumya Chaturvedi of the India Foundation showed that there were 91 terror incidents targeted towards civilians and security forces in 2019 which came down to 74 in 2020 and 65 till September 2021. Likewise, the number of terrorists arrested has increased from 84 in 2019 to 279 in 2020 while the number of terrorists killed has increased from 161 in 2019 to 232 in 2020. Thirteen terrorist hideouts were busted in 2019 while that number has gone up to 44 in 2020, along with unearthing of several illegal cross-border tunnels. Until September 2021, 171 terrorists had been arrested, 120 neutralised and 27 hideouts busted. All this seems to have flummoxed the malefactors across the border who had been hoping for a major resistance to erupt in the state. Since it has become almost impossible for them to undertake any major terror incident using heavy weapons like AK 56 rifles, they are resorting to lonewolf attacks like the ones witnessed recently using small-time ruffians and small weapons like pistols. They are also using newer tactics like using drones and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. No doubt the recent spate of killings in Srinagar and other parts is unfortunate and alarming. The use of newer technologies and the new-found euphoria in sections of radicalised youth after the rise of Taliban in Afghanistan are challenges security agencies face today. But the larger question to ponder is why the terrorists were forced to change their tactics. It is essentially due to the successes achieved by the government in the last two years not only on the security front but also on the political and development fronts. Once dominated by separatist cacophony, the political discourse in Kashmir is now largely development and aspiration centric. Soft-separatist voices of leaders like Mehbooba Mufti have been marginalised and isolated. A blend in regional and national political agendas was witnessed at the meeting of J&K leaders hosted by Prime Minister Modi a few months ago where the predominant discourse was about granting statehood to the UT. In the last few years, J&K has moved in the direction of firmly establishing grassroots democracy. The days when the state was being run by a handful of politicians from Srinagar have gone. An elected three-tier Panchayat Raj system including village, block and district panchayats was put in place. These grassroots elected leaders were provided with funds, functions and functionaries. On the development front, the UT is achieving great successes. The Niti Aayog has declared J&K as an ‘achiever’ in SDGs. The UT has attracted investment commitments to the tune of Rs 26,000 crore in the last couple of years. It is expected that the investment inflow will further increase to over Rs 50,000 crore leading to generation of one million jobs. Educational, health and civic infrastructure in the state too has improved tremendously with new educational institutions, hospitals, tunnels and roads coming up. Lifeline of the state, tourism, has witnessed tremendous rise in numbers with more than 13 lakh visitors in September alone. Return of Kashmiri Hindus has started with 3,000 job recruitments since 2018. Jammu & Kashmir is going through a major transformation after the much-needed neutralisation of Article 370. The wounds created by faulty and compromising policies in the past were deep. The heavy dose of realism administered by the Modi government is yielding results. In the meantime, the Opposition will do well to overcome the tendency of subjecting government’s direction to daily calumny and the media will do well to desist from subjecting the people of Kashmir to a daily patriotism test. Against: Sajad Lone The only gainers in this new set-up are the bureaucracyI don’t agree that an era of change has been set in J&K by virtue of some policy of the Union government. I am surprised that there is a motion at all about the report card of an administration which is selected and not elected. Assume for a moment that the policy of the Union government is working. What is the cost? The cost is in terms of democracy. Who will decide in a federal structure that the state of affairs is good or bad in a particular province and that intervention is needed. And who will decide that the intervention by the federal government has been good or bad, and that it is now time to hand over the reins of governance back to the people of that province. In the federal context, the whole concept of people-less intervention by the federal government doesn’t fall within the realm of democracy. The current situation in J&K is more about harm to democracy in the federal context than the state of affairs in J&K. Such is the power of the ideological discourse that respected media institutions across the country seem to have forgotten that the current administration in J&K is a selected administration, not an elected administration. And selected administrations are antithetical to the concept of democracy. Administrations can either be democratic or undemocratic. That we are saddled with an administration not belonging to the people of J&K continues not to be the debate across India is a deeply worrying and disturbing trend. When we move on from the democracy debate and try to evaluate progress on the ground, there is little or nothing to show. The policy of the Centre in terms of achieving administrative excellence is simply not working. There is no administrative excellence to show case. Things have become worse as they would in any other part of India if it were outsourced to bureaucrats. The development indicators of J&K were in no way starkly different from the rest of the country in the past. We were doing quite well and we may now not be doing quite well. We are topping in unemployment though, across the country at 21%, according to the latest data released. Development has taken a back seat. Decision making is arbitrary and every bureaucrat walking around in the secretariat is the new Kashmir expert in town. The recurring theme of conversations with the current rulers of J&K is how they need time to remedy things. And for heaven’s sake what was wrong in the first place and what are they going to remedy? What have bureaucrats remedied in the rest of the country that is yet to be remedied in J&K? The only creed empowered in the last three years is the bureaucracy. They are having an extended honeymoon and enjoying every moment and wishing and praying that these moments become everlasting. This is sadly the biggest takeaway. The central government by virtue of their actions has invented a new creed of bureaucrats who are totally invested in the current status quo. They openly lay scorn on the concept of an elected government and are happy working in a government “by them and for them”. These are the new gainers in the current set-up. And they are the scriptwriters of doom of the past and “glory” of the future. Far from administrative excellence, there is administrative paralysis in the state administration. The rulers and the ruled have nothing in common. They are two different species living on two different planets. I would strongly argue that reality needs to be reflected as it exists in J&K. Reality cannot and should not be viewed through the prism of a certain version of nationalism. The reality as I see it is that the people of J&K have been disempowered. And even sadder is the reality that people in the rest of the country have been fed a version by virtue of which they seem to be justify what is being done in J&K. The need of the day is to restore democracy. Elected governments bring in revolutions of change, revolutions of development. One could argue that if the current model of governance in J&K is so good, why don’t we apply the same model of governance in the rest of the country? I would never for the sake of my countrymen ever recommend this model of governance for any state or for the rest of the country. And I sincerely hope that my fellow countrymen will replicate the emotion and facilitate and advocate the return of democracy in J&K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/times-face-off-following-the-recent-attacks-in-jk-many-raised-the-spectre-of-the-1990s-is-it-back-to-those-days-or-is-the-centres-policy-paying-off/articleshow/87034151.cms||---

Mirza Danish Anand (29), who has also played at the under-19 cricket for West Bengal, and Anurag Kumar (30), a yoga instructor in Haridwar, were arrested as a part of a month-long probe into the cricket scam, police said. So far, six persons, including an Uttarakhand cricket academy owner, have been arrested in the case. More than 14 aspiring cricketers, police said, have been cheated of at least Rs 1.3 crore by the accused. “Anand and Anurag were arrested after police found a trail of financial transactions in their accounts,” sub-inspector Umesh Chand, who is the investigating officer from EOW, said. Mirza Danish and Anurag, both originally from Uttar Pradesh, had played together at the club level in Delhi and were in touch since then. Kumar, police said, had played cricket at the district level for Delhi and Rajasthan too. The two men, according to investigators, were also in touch with the other accused arrested in the case. The scam had come to light on August 24 after Anshul Raj, resident of New Palam Vihar, filed a complaint at Sector 50 police station, alleging that Secure Corporate Management (SCM), which claimed to be working with several cricket bodies, had cheated him of Rs 10 lakh by assuring him of selection in the state cricket team. The case was transferred to the EOW, which on September 4 arrested the directors of SCM -- Ashutosh Bora, Chitra Bora, and Nitin Jha – from a five-star hotel in Gurgaon. During their interrogation, police claimed, names of around 8-9 persons associated with several cricket bodies of Assam, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh had come up. The EOW had issued notices to all of them asking them to join the investigation. During the probe, police found that the accused had transferred around Rs 10 lakh to the account of Kulbeer Rawat, who owned a cricket academy in Uttarakhand. Rawat was arrested on September 30. Meanwhile, Chitra Bora has moved a bail application before the Punjab and Haryana high court on health grounds. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for November 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bowled-caught-ex-ipl-net-player-held-as-cricket-scam-arrests-rise-to-6/articleshow/87031716.cms||Bagish Jha

---||World||Bill Clinton in hospital for non-Covid-related infection||WASHINGTON: Former President Bill Clinton was admitted to a Southern California hospital Tuesday with an infection but he is ``on the mend,'' his spokesman said Thursday. Clinton, 75, was admitted to the University of California Irvine Medical Center on Tuesday evening for a non-Covid-related infection, Angel Urena said in a statement. ``He is on the mend, in good spirits and is incredibly thankful to the doctors, nurses, and staff providing him with excellent care,'' the statement said. A second statement from Clinton's spokesman quoted physicians Dr. Alpesh Amin and Dr. Lisa Bardack, who said the former president has been ``administered IV antibiotics and fluids.'' ``After two days of treatment, his white blood cell count is trending down and he is responding to antibiotics well,'' the doctors said. ``The California-based medical team has been in constant communication with the President's New York-based medical team, including his cardiologist. We hope to have him go home soon.'' In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery. He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health. He repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, mostly notably his wife, Hillary, during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as his wife sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, Clinton by then a grandfather and nearing 70 returned to the campaign trail. The UCI Medical Center is in Orange County, about 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Los Angeles. It wasn't immediately clear why Clinton was in Southern California.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bill-clinton-in-hospital-for-non-covid-related-infection/articleshow/87034322.cms||---
---||World||Sydney to end Covid-19 quarantine for international travellers||SYDNEY: Sydney will end its Covid-19 quarantine for fully vaccinated international travellers from November 1, New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet said on Friday, foreshadowing the full return of overseas travel after more than 19 months. Australia closed its international borders in March 2020 in response to the pandemic, allowing entry almost exclusively to only citizens and permanent residents who are required to undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine at their own expense. "We want people back, we are leading the nation out of the pandemic ... we are opening Sydney and New South Wales to the world," Perrottet told reporters in Sydney, the state capital. The federal government's reopening plans unveiled in July proposed abolishing caps on returning vaccinated Australians and a gradual reopening of international travel with safe countries once full vaccination rates reach 80%. The office of Prime Minister Scott Morrison was not immediately available to comment on the New South Wales plan. New South Wales is expected to reach 80% full vaccination levels in the adult population this weekend, while the rest of the country will take at least some weeks to reach that level. The move to open borders comes as daily infections in New South Wales eased further to 399 from 406 on Thursday, well down from the state's pandemic high of 1,599 in early September. Neighbouring Victoria state reported 2,179 new locally acquired cases, the majority in Melbourne, down from a record 2,297 a day earlier. Australia had stayed largely virus-free for most of this year until a third wave of infections fuelled by the Delta variant spread across its southeast from late June, forcing a months-long lockdown in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The country's overall coronavirus numbers are still relatively low, with some 139,000 cases and 1,506 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/sydney-to-end-covid-19-quarantine-for-international-travellers/articleshow/87034356.cms||---

All workers must show a so-called Green Pass, offering proof of vaccination, recent recovery from Covid-19 or a negative test -- or face being declared absent without pay. More than 86 percent of Italians over the age of 12 have received at least one jab, thus automatically qualifying for the certification. But up to three million workers are estimated to be unvaccinated -- and most will only be able to work if they pay for their own tests either every 48 or 72 hours, depending on the type. They include large numbers in the freight industry -- and with many angry at the new rules and refusing to comply, there are fears of widespread economic disruption. Ivano Russo, director general of Confetra, a trade group, told AFP that out of a total of 900,000 truck drivers, couriers and warehouse staff employed by members of his lobby, "25-30 percent" do not have Covid certificates. Dock workers in Trieste, a major hub in the northeast, have threatened to go on strike indefinitely, despite being offered free Covid tests. The same privilege has been extended to some dockers in Genoa, in the northwest. "The real problem with the Green Pass for the port of Genoa, in general for all ports, will be road haulage," Roberto Gulli of the Uil trade union told La Repubblica newspaper. "There could be chaos on Friday." Nevertheless, more than 560,000 Green Passes were downloaded on Wednesday, according to government data, suggesting that the advent of the new rules was boosting vaccinations. Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government has defended the Green Pass as a way of avoiding further lockdowns in Italy, where the economy is expected to record almost six percent growth this year after a devastating Covid-induced recession. Ministers looked unlikely to concede to calls for free Covid tests for all, but the ANSA news agency reported that they were considering larger tax breaks for firms that pay for them. Anti-pass protests were also expected across Italy on Friday, but the government hopes to avoid a repeat of last weekend's demonstrations in Rome which degenerated into violent clashes inflamed by far-right militants. Trade unions on Saturday are also planning an anti-fascist rally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/protests-and-blockades-italy-braces-for-new-covid-rules/articleshow/87034458.cms||---

Police arrested Samba Siva Rao, a native of Guntur, who runs an advertising agency in Visakhapatnam. According to police, Samba Siva Rao befriended M Sadhana, an accused manager of Canara Bank’s Chandanagar branch, while she was working in Visakhapatnam in 2008. According to police, Rao used to call up Sadhana and played a crucial role in convincing her to be part of the 64.5 crore FD fraud on the instructions of another accused N Venkata Raman. For being a conduit between Sadhana and the other accused, Rao received 55 lakh as commission.

Auckland, the country's largest city, entered into a lockdown in mid-August to stamp out an outbreak of the Delta variant, with officials looking to end the strict restrictions when full vaccination rates reach 90%. About 2.6 million New Zealanders have so far been fully vaccinated, or about 62% of the eligible population. New Zealand, which had stayed largely virus-free for most of the pandemic until a Delta outbreak in mid-August, is now looking to live with Covid-19 through higher inoculations.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: ‘Festive rush, drop in night temperatures spike air pollution before Diwali’||LUCKNOW: Festive rush together with a slight drop in the night temperatures have impacted the city’s clean air causing a spike in air pollution levels by over 100 units in the past one week. The state capital was under the ‘satisfactory’ air quality category in the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) list at the beginning of the month. Times ViewAir pollution levels have started rising post-monsoon and are expected to shoot up with the onset of winter. Besides weather conditions, the other main factors responsible for air pollution include bad roads, unregulated construction, vehicular emission and open garbage burning. The pollutants from these activities can be kept under control if district authorities take steps in advance to implement the protocols recommended by the National Green Tribunal.However, it now figures in the ‘moderate’ air quality category. The exposure to such air leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases, warn experts. The analysis of Lucknow’s Air Quality Index (AQI) data released daily by CPCB indicates an increasing trend in the city’s air pollution level. While the city’s AQI was 71 on October 1, on Thursday an AQI of 156 was recorded. From October 1-7, the city's air pollution levels ranged between 71 and 156 with October 3 recording an AQI of 55 (lowest pollution levels witnessed in October). Thereafter, the air pollution increased falling in a range of 130-175, with October 10 recording a highest of 175. According to Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre of Science and Environment, New Delhi, the change in weather conditions and local factors has led to this spike. “Every year around this time from October onwards winter pollution begins to build up. One of the key reasons behind it is the atmospheric changes. As winter sets in, we experience something called ‘temperature inversion condition’ in which due to falling temperatures, air cannot rise high to disperse and as a result it gets trapped and so do the pollutants,” she said. Environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta attributed traffic jams due to the festive rush to the hike in pollution level. He said, “Traffic snarls because of people venturing out for festivals are the main reason behind the spike in air pollution levels. People should use the metro and public transport more to save air quality from deteriorating.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-festive-rush-drop-in-night-temperatures-spike-air-pollution-before-diwali/articleshow/87034326.cms||---

This was the highest singleday spike this year. After confirmation by the health authorities, the death of the youth became the first officially recorded casualty due to dengue in the city this year. TimesViewPrecaution, not panic, is the key to tame dengue. Do not allow water to accumulate in and around your houses, prevent mosquito bites and in case of fever consult a doctor. Do not self-medicate. Mortality rate of dengue is low and death occurs only in cases when initial symptoms are ignored. While people need to be vigilant, health and civic authorities must carry out extensive anti-mosquito drives not only in hotspot areas, but across the city.Besides, the surge in cases pushed dengue caseload beyond 600 since January. Of this, 522 (87%) have come in the past one-and-a-halfmonths with an average of 12 daily. Health department death audit found that the deceased, a resident of Old City, was suffering from a chronic kidney disease. His condition deteriorated after contracting dengue, eventually leading to renal failure. “The patient was admitted to a private hospital for treatment of kidney disease and during clinical investigations it was revealed that he was also suffering from dengue,” said Dr KP Tripathi, in charge of the district vectorborne diseases unit. Earlier, two persons from other districts had died due to dengue here. Among those diagnosed on Thursday, the condition of four was serious due to a drop in platelet count. These patients were hospitalised and are under observation, while the rest are at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teen-dies-of-dengue-in-lucknow-first-victim-this-year/articleshow/87034388.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Business||There's no country in the world where wives earn more than husbands: Study||NEW DELHI: There is not a single country in the world, where wives, on an average, earn more than their husbands, reveals a global study of the difference in earnings between heterosexual couples over a four-decade period. Researchers from the Centre of Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore looked at publicly available data from 2.85 million households across 45 countries, dating between 1973 and 2016. While pay inequality was rampant in certain regions, they also found that gender pay inequality persisted across countries, over time and across both rich and poor households. They found that even when both partners were employed, there is not a single country where wives earned as much as their husbands, even in the most affluent nations. "Even in the Nordic countries, which have the lowest levels of gender inequality in the world, we found the women's share is less than 50% everywhere", said Professor Deepak Malghan, of the Centre for Public Policy, Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. The researchers said some of the reasons women earn less are universal. Men are culturally seen as breadwinners, and women as homemakers. Many women take a break -- or even leave paid work -- after childbirth. Unpaid housework and caregiving still remain largely a woman's responsibility. The one silver lining: intra-household inequality is down 20% between 1973 and 2016. This can be attributed to increased participation of women in the labour force, more women-friendly policies and movements for equal pay for equal work. But corporates can do a lot more to bridge the gap such as ensuring more family-friendly and child-friendly policies at the workplace. The most gender equal country in the world is Iceland, followed by Finland Norway, with New Zealand being a close fourth, according to the Global Gender Gap Report 2021. But in Sweden too, women still earn only 86 cents to a man’s dollar for a similar role. India in 2021 has slipped 28 places and has been ranked 140th among 156 nations participating in the rankings. It is the third-worst performer among South Asian countries, with Pakistan and Afghanistan trailing and Bangladesh being at the top. The economic participation and opportunity gap saw a decline of 3% compared to 2020. India has one of the lowest female workforce participation rates in the world and the pandemic has made matters worse, with four out of five women neither working nor looking for jobs. The labour force has shrunk 2% for men but 13% for women over the previous year, according to November 2020 data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. This means that 13% women had dropped out of the labour force. The female labour participation rate in India too had fallen to 20.3% in 2019 from more than 26% in 2005, according to World Bank estimates, compared with 30.5% in neighbouring Bangladesh and 33.7% in Sri Lanka. This implies that 79% of Indian women do not even seek work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/theres-no-country-in-the-world-where-wives-earn-more-than-husbands-study/articleshow/87034635.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

The child kept crying for hours until her parents, who were frantically looking for her, came around to check and heard her screams. They broke open the lock and rescued her at night. The toddler had arrived at the centre around 10.45am. After playing with the women staff for some time, she began playing on her own and the staff too got busy with their work. After some time, without checking if all the children had gone home, an anganwadi worker and her helper locked up the centre and went home. Realising she was alone in a locked-up darkened building, the child began crying but no one was around to hear it. Her parents realized she hadn’t returned home when they came back from work. Alarmed, they went looking for her. Their panic grew every time they drew a blank at friends’ or relatives. Then, someone told them she was seen going to the anganwadi centre in the morning. They ran to the centre and heard her crying. They gathered villagers and broke the lock. Thirsty, terrified and fatigued after crying for hours, the child was almost unconscious by the time they got to her. News of this reached senior administrative officials on Thursday. An FIR was lodged against a worker on the basis of the parents’ complaint. The child development project officer has showcaused the worker and ordered a probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/toddler-left-alone-locked-up-for-hours-at-anganwadi-centre-in-durg/articleshow/87026122.cms||---
---||World||California firefighters, aircraft try to box in wildfire||SANTA BARBARA: More than 1,300 firefighters, helped by aircraft dumping water and fire retardant, worked on Thursday to contain a wildfire in a Southern California coastal mountain range that has closed a major highway for days. The Alisal Fire has charred more than 26 square miles (67 square kilometers) of chaparral and grass in the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara since it erupted on Monday amid high winds. It is 11% contained. Authorities have said the fire is a threat to about 100 ranches and isolated homes. Among the properties being protected is Rancho del Cielo, which was once owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan and used as their western retreat during his presidency. The 688-acre (278-hectare) ranch sits high atop the mountain range. Winds when the fire broke out blasted flames down the face of the mountain range towards the Pacific Ocean and the fire reached a beach after jumping the US 101 highway and a rail line. The winds since then have shifted but have been less intense. Firefighters on Thursday were focusing on stopping the movement of the blaze to the west after winds pushed it that way late on Wednesday, said fire information officer Kristen Allison. Aircraft dropped a long line of fire retardant along a ridgetop road to help keep the fire from moving north and a wildfire burn scar slowed the blaze's movement to the east. An older burn scar lay to the west. "The further this fire moves both east and west it will move into some fire scars from previous wildfires, so those areas aren't going to have nearly the amount of fuels for the fire to work with," said Andrew Madsen, an information officer with Los Padres National Forest. The fire remained about a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) from the former Reagan ranch on Thursday, said Jessica Jensen, an official of the Young America's Foundation, a conservative organization that now operates the ranch. The foundation has expressed confidence in measures to keep the ranch property safe. The rail line reopened on Thursday afternoon but US 101 remained closed. Elsewhere, gusty winds, low humidity and dry vegetation triggered red flag warnings of high fire danger in parts of Northern California's interior. Pacific Gas Electric initially planned to cut power to thousands of customers in numerous counties on Thursday to prevent fires from being ignited by wind damage to power lines. But the utility said the wind event appeared to be weaker than on that led to thousands of shutoffs on Monday and then rapidly scaled down the latest forced outage plan. By midday, customers in parts of only one county faced a notice of a potential power shutoff. California wildfires have scorched nearly 3,900 square miles (10,101 square kilometers) this year and destroyed more than 3,600 homes, businesses and other structures, according to the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-firefighters-aircraft-try-to-box-in-wildfire/articleshow/87034746.cms||---

---||Business||Online festive sale: 68 crore smartphones purchased every hour||NEW DELHI: New launches, EMI Options, discount offers and several upgrade plans have ensured a strong demand for mobile phones and electronic appliances during the ongoing festive sales. According to a report by research firm, Redseer Consulting, smartphones worth Rs 68 crore were purchased every hour on the e-commerce platforms. Among all e-tailers, Flipkart has even surpassed Amazon to emerge as the leader during the festive sales with a 64% market share. The first week of sales on e-commerce platforms has generated Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of $4.6 billion (Rs 32,000 crore), a 32 per cent year-on-year sales growth. The overall number of shoppers grew 20 per cent on year, led by Tier-II buyers who constituted 61 per cent of the base. In fact, the GMV per user has gone up from Rs 4,980 in 2020 to Rs 5,034 in 2022. So what's driving the sales this year?“The festive season this year has been one that is driven by a larger theme of affordability. Constructs were built carefully by the platforms through BNPL schemes and bank tie-ups as well as seller driven discounts to serve up the most competitive prices of top leading brands and serve the aspiring customer,” said Ujjwal Chaudhry, associate partner at RedSeer Consulting. Here are some more factors that drove sales. 1. Fashion has made a comeback: Fashion has picked up slack, driven by customer demand to refresh their wardrobes as Covid restrictions have eased across the country and people are stepping out again. Secondly, newer affordable platforms are now reaching Tier II and III customers. While Amazon.in and Flipkart.com still contribute to 70% of the overall fashion sales, the remaining market saw Meesho emerge as a winner with a 39% share. With their affordable offering, they are targeting a typical Indian household looking for good value products. 2. Tier II continues to show up: Tier II population is driving festive sales on the different platforms largely enabled by various affordability schemes. With over 40 million shoppers coming from T2+ cities- this festive was one that was dictated by affordability schemes. 3. Fast delivery: eCommerce platforms were able to shave an average of 5 hours on delivery timelines thanks to better warehouse planning and a streamlined supply chain 4. Newer customers: The festive sales this year proved that brands and sellers selling online have reason to be bullish about the future with increased adoption of online shopping in Tier II+ cities and newer customers coming online for the first time. 5. Mobiles continued to dominate the % share of all products across different platforms: With mid- and high-end brands becoming more attainable thanks to banking partnerships and seller-driven discounts, mobiles and appliances remained strong this year. What didn't work? Demand for other categories like home furnishings, decor and furnishings have been subdued this year. RedSeer had earlier said that the platforms will clock over $9 billion gross merchandise value (GMV) during the festive season. The report estimates that over 75 per cent customers are planning to buy equivalent to or more than last year across categories like mobiles, large appliances, beauty and fashion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/online-festive-sale-68-crore-smartphones-purchased-every-hour/articleshow/87034761.cms||Sunainaa Chadha

Women feel mentally stressed because of liquor consumption because they have to look after the home and family, Anila said, telling the village menfolk: “ Thodi thodi pi lia karo aur so jaya karo (drink a little and go to sleep).” Later, she issued a clarification and said her statement was being “twisted”. “This is political mischief,” she said. “I was addressing men addicted to liquor and I said they should drink less. Women have to face a lot of mental pressure due to the responsibilities of home and children. I meant to say liquor addiction is bad and one should get rid of it,” Anila clarified. The minister, a two-time MLA, was on a tour of her assembly constituency in Singhola village of Balod district, around 120km from Raipur, on Wednesday. While speaking to Kamar tribe women, she was told that liquor consumption had spiked in the village ever since the government allowed villagers to brew their own liquor for consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/chhatisgarh-let-men-take-a-peg-and-go-to-sleep-minister-for-women-and-child-welfare-anila-bhediya-advises-women/articleshow/87034833.cms||---

This statement comes after the WHO launched an expert group on Wednesday that will study the origins of new pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the news during his press briefing from Geneva, "following a public call for experts." "China will continue to support and participate in global scientific origins-tracing and firmly oppose any form of political manipulation," said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said during a press conference on Thursday. "We hope that all parties concerned, including the WHO Secretariat and SAGO will adopt an objective, scientific and responsible attitude, follow the requirements and relevant mandates of the WHA resolution, take the first phase of the joint study as the basis, adhere to a global perspective, perform their duties in an objective and fair manner, and truly make a positive contribution to global origins-tracing and anti-epidemic cooperation," he added. The proposed members of the WHO Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) were selected for their expertise in areas such as epidemiology, animal health, clinical medicine, virology and genomics. The 26 experts were selected from over 700 applications and were chosen for their world-class expertise and experience in a range of disciplines, as well as their geographic and gender diversity. "SAGO will advise WHO on the development of a global framework to define and guide studies into the origins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2," he said. "The emergence of new viruses with the potential to spark epidemics and pandemics is a fact of nature, and while SARS-CoV-2 is the latest such virus, it will not be the last." Answering a question, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO Technical Lead on Covid-19, had stated that SAGO will recommend further studies in China, and potentially elsewhere, to understand the origins of the new coronavirus, UN News reported. While SAGO will advise WHO, any future missions will be organized by the UN agency and the country in question. "I want to make it very clear that the SAGO is not the next mission team. There's been some misrepresentation about that going forward," she said. A WHO-led team of scientists that travelled to China in early 2021 to investigate the origins of the virus struggled to get a clear picture of what research China was conducting beforehand, faced constraints during its visit, and had little power to conduct thorough and impartial research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-warns-against-manipulation-of-whos-covid-19-origin-probe/articleshow/87034868.cms||---

Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri of the HC has issued the notice after taking cognizance of the petition. According to the petitioner, when she was admitted in Civil Hospital, Bathinda for treatment of anaemia on May 6, 2020, she was transfused HIV-positive blood by Richu Goyal, former medical laboratory technician. Petitioner also alleged that Dr Krishna Goyal, in-charge of blood bank, came to know about this in May 2020 but did not inform her superior officers. It was on October 5, 2020, that a committee of doctors submitted an inquiry report to Dr Maninder Singh, SMO Bathinda confirming the aforementioned allegations. Dr Maninder Singh, SMO, however, did not take any steps for locating the petitioner, and on being contacted at a very late stage in August, 2021, she visited civil hospital, Bathinda and tested HIV positive. Her husband and seven-year-old daughter also tested HIV positive, having been infected from the petitioner. All the three were granted admission for regular treatment in ART Centre of Civil Hospital, Bathinda on August 28, 2021.

---||World||Bangladesh: PM Hasina warns those involved in communal violence, says 'attackers won't be spared'||DHAKA: Giving a stern warning to perpetrators of communal violence, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that anyone involved in the attacks on Hindu temples and Durga Puja venues in Cumilla will not be spared irrespective of which religion they belong to. "The incidents in Cumilla are being thoroughly investigated. Nobody will be spared. It doesn't matter which religion they belong to. They will be hunted down and punished," she said on Thursday, reported Dhaka Tribune. The prime minister made the remarks while exchanging greetings with people of the Hindu community during an event at Dhakeshwari National Temple in Dhaka on the occasion of Durga Puja. She joined the program from Ganabhaban through a video conference. Terming the incident of vandalizing temples in Cumilla "very unfortunate," she said that those who are unable to earn the confidence and trust of the people and have no ideology can carry out such attacks. "We are getting a large amount of information. We will definitely trace those who carried out the attacks... This is the age of technology," she added. "They must be found. We did so in the past and will do it in the future, too. They must face due punishment. Exemplary punishment will be given so that none can dare to engage in this type of incident in future," said the prime minister, reported Dhaka Tribune. She also called upon all to work in unison and remain vigilant to stop the recurrence of such heinous acts. She said that people irrespective of caste, creed and religion celebrate all festivals together in Bangladesh, adding, "Religion is for individuals and festival is for all and we enjoy every festival together." Hasina said the Cumilla incident occurred at a time when the country was progressing towards development at full speed and it was aimed at hampering the journey of the nation's uplift and creating a problem in the country. On Wednesday, tensions erupted among a faction of locals in Cumilla after news broke on social media about the alleged desecration of the Holy Quran at a Durga Puja venue on the bank of Nanuar Dighi. At one point, the situation began getting out of hand and riots started spreading to a number of Puja venues in the adjacent areas. The local administration and police came under attack while trying to establish order, reported Dhaka Tribune. Similar incidents also occurred in different districts across the country on Wednesday night and Thursday, leading the government to deploy Border Guard Bangladesh troopers in 22 districts alongside additional law enforcement officials. There have been reports of several people getting killed during clashes in Chandpur, while dozens of people have been either injured in clashes or arrested by law enforcers in multiple districts until now. At Thursday's event, a Hindu community leader sought the government's intervention in view of the information that some people are planning to attack them during immersion of the idols of goddess Durga on Friday. Prime Minister Hasina said they are aware of this matter and measures have already been taken to this end. She called upon the leaders of the Hindu community, particularly the Bangladesh Puja Udjapon Committee, to formulate a policy to determine how many Puja mandaps will be set up across the country to celebrate the Durga Puja -- keeping in mind the constraint of security personnel to ensure safety and security of the mandaps. She also urged the Hindu community not to consider them as a minority and perform their religious rituals with the same rights enjoyed by followers of other religions as they have born and brought up in the country and fought shoulder to shoulder to liberate the country during the 1971 Liberation War. "We believe that those who are born on the soil of this country and who are its children will practice their respective religions freely," she said. Highlighting various measures taken by her government to uplift the Hindu community, she said that her government was committed to ensuring the welfare of all irrespective of caste, creed and religion. Hasina said the dignity of Bangladesh has been established on the global stage as it has turned into a developing nation, adding, "We want the country to be a developed and prosperous one by 2041 with upholding the dignity."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/bangladesh-pm-hasina-warns-those-involved-in-communal-violence-says-attackers-wont-be-spared/articleshow/87034993.cms||---
