A report published by the BBC Urdu claimed that the trial against Hasan Askari, a computer engineer, was conducted by a field general court martial (FGCM) in Gujranwala cantonment in central Punjab. As the accused was denied his own counsel, the court provided him with its lawyer. Zafar Mehdi Askari, father of the accused, is a former two-star general from the Pakistan army. Following the FGCM order, Askari was shifted to a high security prison in Sahiwal. Askari was convicted by the military court for writing a letter to the army chief, where he criticized Bajwa for his polices and receiving extension in service, besides urging him to resign from his post. Askari also sent copies of the letter to many serving two-star and three-star generals. Senior Askari said his son was taken into custody by men in plain clothes, a veiled reference to ISI operatives, last year, two days before his family came to know that an FIR was lodged against him at a local police station. Some days later, the family received a letter, which stated that a local magistrate had handed over Askari to a commanding officer of the army. Subsequently, a military court tried Askari on the charge of treason, described in the FIR as an attempt to serve the agenda of anti-Pakistan elements. The case was kept secret by the military authorities and only surfaced when senior Askari approached the Lahore high court, requesting it to shift his son from the prison in Sahiwal to Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The high court issued notices to all the parties in the case, including the FGCM, to appear before it. The petitioner also informed the court that his family was kept in the dark for weeks after the conviction of his son by the military court. The retired army officer also claimed in the petition that his son was not allowed to meet his counsel. The petitioner further stated that the his family lives in Islamabad and it would be nearly impossible for Askari's parents to visit him in jail in Sahiwal, as his mother, who is critically ill, undergoes dialysis three days a week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-ex-generals-son-convicted-for-inciting-anarchy-in-army/articleshow/87408189.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Amaravati||In Andhra Pradesh, 2 decades of drought emptying out ‘blessed’ district||Anantapur in Telugu means “blessed with many things”. It's an ironic name for a place that has come to be known for what it’s not blessed with — rainfall. This district in Andhra Pradesh has seen 18 droughts in the last 20 years (till 2020), making it a living example of creeping desertification and mass migration. Situated in the bowels of the rain-shadow region of Rayalaseema, Anantapur is the driest district in south India. Met records since 1882 show Anantapur has long been notorious for droughts and water distress. But recent decades have been particularly severe. In the last 30 years, the cultivated area in the district has dropped by 50%, from 30 lakh acres to roughly 15 lakh acres, as the drought pattern changed from once every three years to almost every year. Even though as per IMD data the district received deficient or scanty annual rainfall on 10 of the 20 years since 2000, the government declared Anantapur drought-affected in 18 of these years as rains were unevenly distributed within the district. An IMD paper on rainfall trends in Andhra Pradesh from 1989 to 2018 shows Anantapur had the state’s highest rainfall variability of 76%, although the amount of rain over these decades had not significantly changed. “Such variability means Anantapur has a high probability of drought or floods in any given year,” said IMD’s Pulak Guhathakurta, one of the authors of the study. With 90% of agriculture in the district being rainfed, the vagaries of the weather has made farming increasingly unviable. In the last 26 years, standing crop in the district has failed in at least 15 years because of drought and thrice due to excess rainfall, according to B Sahadeva Reddy, chief scientist at the Anantapur Research Station.  Many landowners have handed over their farmlands to tenant cultivators for free. Those who collect tenancy fees get only between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 per acre — a pittance compared to Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 per acre in other districts. Y V Malla Reddy, director of Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre based in Anantapur, estimates that around four to six lakh workers have migrated out, many heading to Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kerala. “Most of them have set up shelters in Bengaluru and work there. They visit their families, if they had left them in native villages, only during festivals like Sankranti and Ugadi. A lot of them were land-owning farmers who sold their lands to pay mounting debts, and turned to manual labour,” Malla Reddy told TOI. Many women who migrated from Anantapur have entered the flesh trade. In Kadiri assembly constituency, around 1,600 women and minor girls have been identified as victims of trafficking. They were forced to take up sex work in Mumbai and even in gulf countries such as Kuwait and UAE, according to the NGOs in the district. Trafficking cases in Anantapur stand at 14,000, as per police records in the last 20 years. A major shift away from traditional crops to groundnut in the 1990s made matters worse. The monocropping was a blow to local biodiversity and farmers began felling trees as groundnut cultivation demands lots of sunshine. Anantapur now has vast stretches of land turning sandy, a phenomenon called desertification, and unfit for cultivation. Gummagatta mandal in Rayadurg assembly constituency is a classic case of climate triggered migration. About 40% of Gummagatta’s population has left, mostly to Bengaluru for construction work. The mandal, once recognised for a variety of crops, is now better known for its specialised labour force. Gonabavi village here is almost barren with no crops being grown. Nearly all farmers are now migrant labour with expertise in digging earth and repairing underground cables. Residents of Kalugodu village of Rayadurg mandal make a living by erecting scaffoldings for high-rise building constructions. It’s a risky job, and not surprisingly, the village has many widows and physically challenged men. Thalari Rajini, 25, lost her husband Ramanji (32) after he fell from the top of a building in Bengaluru on February 22, 2019. The day he died, Rajini gave birth to a second child, a daughter. Rajini is not eligible for a widow pension as her mother-in-law, listed in the same ration card, is already a beneficiary. “I received only Rs 2 lakh out of Rs 5 lakh from the Chandranna Bheema scheme because of the change in government,” Rajini told TOI. Another widow, Rajamma (50), lost her husband and a son in similar mishaps in Bengaluru. Her youngest son Suresh (23), who also worked in Bengaluru, is now physically challenged after falling from a scaffolding in 2020. The families of Rajini and Rajamma owned five acres of land each a decade ago. The lands were sold off to pay for debts. Many seasonal migrants return to claim their National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (NREGA) benefit for 100 days every year. “A significant number of people have returned to Anantapur during the Covid-19 pandemic. The district tops in the state for most NREGA funds being disbursed. We have given extra money that the central government gave in view of Covid-19 as well. We are trying to provide jobs to them in other ways as well by promoting multi-crop cultivation,” district collector S Naga Lakshmi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/2-decades-of-drought-emptying-out-andhras-blessed-district/articleshow/87408762.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Rejection of his plea by the Centre was also not communicated to him in jail. The doctor, a director of the City Hospital in Jabalpur, was detained on May 12 for three months by state police by invoking the National Security Act (NSA) on the ground that he was allegedly selling fake Remdesivir injections to Covid patients when the pandemic was at its peak. His detention was further extended till November 12. The doctor had challenged his detention before the high court, but it was rejected and he approached the apex court. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath, B V Nagarathna, after examining all records, found procedural lapses on part of the government authorities and invalidated the detention order. It said detenues have been granted rights under Article 22(5) which mandates that the authority making the order shall as soon as may be communicate grounds on which the order has been made. The detaining authority shall provide the person detained the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. “The delay by the state government in disposing of the representation and by the central and state government in communicating such rejection, strikes at the heart of procedural rights and guarantees granted to the detenu. It is necessary to understand that the law provides for such procedural safeguards to balance the wide powers granted to the executive under the NSA,” the bench said. “The significance of Article 22 is that the representation which has been submitted by the detenu must be disposed of at an early date. The communication of the grounds of detention, as soon as may be, and the affording of the earliest opportunity to submit a representation against the order of detention will have no constitutional significance unless the detaining authority deals with the representation and communicates its decision with expedition,” the bench said. In this case, the doctor was detained on May 12 and he submitted a simultaneous representation before the district magistrate, state government and the central government on May 18. The representation was communicated by the district magistrate to the state government and the central government on May 20. It was processed for consideration by the Union home secretary on June 14 and on June 24 his representation was rejected which is alleged to have been communicated by a wireless message. He was not communicated about the outcome. There was a one-and-a-half-month delay on the part of the central government in considering the representation. The representation made to the state government was also decided after two months. “By delaying its decision on the representation, the state government deprived the detenu of the valuable right which emanates from the provisions of Section 8(1) of having the r epresentation being considered expeditiously,” the bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-raps-mp-govt-over-detention-of-doc-under-nsa-nixes-order/articleshow/87408287.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Reports from Rome said the Pope accepted the invitation and if he does travel to India, it will mark the first papal visit after 1999 when the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM. The discussion and invitation are significant as they come against the backdrop of a heated debate over conversions between the right wing and church organisations in India and in the light of several BJP-governed states passing laws in this regard.

Official sources said Modi has made the effort to connect with the Christian community. In February 2015, he addressed the celebration of the elevation to sainthood of Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Mother Euphrasia. He also attended the 90th birth anniversary celebrations of Joseph Mar Thoma on June 27, 2020. The sources said Modi has taken up issues in his Mann Ki Baat as well, where he spoke of India handing over the holy relic or icon of Saint Queen Ketevan to Georgia by the foreign minister himself. “The ceremony, which took place in a very emotionally charged atmosphere, was attended by the President of Georgia, the Prime Minister, many religious leaders, and a large number of Georgians,” Modi had said. The Prime Minister has regularly spoken of the message of Christ in his radio talks and also dwelt on the legacy of people like Mother Teresa. The government has worked hard to rescue people of the cloth, who were stuck or held hostage in places like Libya, sources said.

Modi explained to the 84-year-old Pontiff that the candelabra was specially made and the bookIn a statement, the foreign ministry said, “During today’s meeting, the two leaders discussed the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences for people across the world. They also discussed the challenge posed by climate change. Prime Minister briefed the Pope about the ambitious initiatives taken by India in combating climate change as well as India’s success in administering one billion Covid-19 vaccination doses.” Modi also extended an invitation to Pope Francis to visit India at an early date, “which was accepted with pleasure”, the MEA added. The optics of Modi, often labelled a Hindu nationalist in the West, hugging Pope Francis is likely to have an impact that some would say can cool inter-religion discord. The BJP-led government has not held back in criticising “forced conversions” by Christian missionaries, particularly in remote tribal areas of India. However, Modi has taken care to engage with the Christian community. Modi also met the Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and Vatican Secretary for Relations with States, Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, according to the Vatican statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-papal-visit-to-india-since-1999-likely-after-pm-modis-invite/articleshow/87409462.cms||---

Kicking off BJP’s campaign in poll-bound Uttarakhand at a public rally in Dehradun, Shah said, “When I came to Uttarakhand earlier, during the Congress tenure, my convoy was stuck in a traffic jam and some people told me that there is permission to block a national highway for namaz on Friday.” He also alleged that the Congress government didn’t carry out restoration works at Kedarnath “for fear of losing its vote bank”. He said: “Congress is synonymous with corruption, scam and appeasement. It can neither work for the poor nor give good administration. The party has always failed to fulfill promises made to people...BJP had fulfilled 85% of the promises in its manifesto since 2017...In this period, works worth Rs 85,000 crore have been started in Uttarakhand”. Shah challenged former Uttarakhand CM and Congress campaign committee chairman in the state Harish Rawat to an open debate. “I will send members of our youth wing for the debate. He (Rawat) needs to tell what was the contribution of the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government in the welfare of Uttarakhand for a period of 10 years,” said Shah. Rawat had recently sought to be relieved as the in charge of party affairs in Punjab to focus on Uttarakhand where he claimed the party was heading towards a “definite win”. Shah said Rawat should “watch his sting video from 2016 again”. In 2016, Rawat was the CM when a news channel released a sting video in which he is purportedly seen negotiating “bribes” to win the support of some rebel Congress MLAs in the house for a trust vote scheduled later. Lauding the efforts of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, Shah said the former has played a commendable role in rescue operations following the recent rains in Uttarakhand. Shah also pointed out that PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Kedarnath on October 5. “He will inaugurate the statue of Adi Shankaracharya during his visit to the shrine,” he added. Shah held a core-committee meeting of BJP at party headquarters. Later, he left for Haridwar where he attended the golden jubilee celebrations of Shanti Kunj Ashram and held a closed-door meeting with Juna akhara’s acharya mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri. Shah said BJP had rolled out the New Education Policy, allowing students to learn in their mother tongue and said “PM Modi’s look during his visit to Varanasi’s Vishwanath temple in 2014 with tripund tilak (three lined) and uttariya (scarf) heralded a change in the society.” Inputs by Sheo S Jaiswal||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-allowed-namaz-on-national-highway-amit-shah/articleshow/87410134.cms||Kautilya Singh

Justice Rahul Chaturvedi, while dismissing the bail plea of Raju, one of the accused in the case, said that it was the duty of the man claiming to be the boyfriend of the girl to protect her when she was being sexually harassed by the co-accused. “The moment the applicant submits that the victim is his beloved, it was his binding duty to protect the dignity, honour and reputation of his girlfriend. If a girl is major one, then to have sex with her consent is not an offence, but certainly it is unethical and immoral and also not in consonance with the established social norms of the Indian society,” the court observed. The court termed the applicant’s act as “highly deplorable and unbecoming of a boyfriend”, stating that “he remained a silent spectator when the co-accused persons were brutally sexually assassinating his beloved in front of him and no effort to put a stiff resistance was made by him so that the soul and body of the victim could be saved from further butchering by these flesh vultures”. On February 20, 2021, an FIR was lodged against four accused under Sections 376-D, 392, 323, 504, and 506 of Indian Penal Code and sections 5 and 6 of the Pocso Act at Akil Sarai police station of Kaushambi district. According to the FIR, the victim went to take sewing lessons at a stitching centre on February 19 and had spoken to her boyfriend Raju over phone and planned to meet him. Later, they meet at a secluded place near a local river. After some time, three other persons reached there, abused and beat up Raju, snatched his mobile and committed the crime with the victim. After examining the material placed on record and the contents of the FIR, the court in its decision dated October 21 denied bail to the applicant, stating that it cannot be said with certainty that the applicant had got no association or connection with the remaining co-accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensual-sex-with-major-girl-not-an-offence-but-unethical-says-high-court/articleshow/87410432.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||India||5 more months to go, NREGS 2021 fund already exhausted||NEW DELHI: In what shows that employment demand under MGNREGS will be high like last year, belying the government’s expectations and funding, the scheme has already exhausted the budget approved for the current financial year with five more months to go. The expenditure under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGS) scheme till now has been Rs 70,134 crore, which is 98.5% of the total allocation, as per the scheme portal. This means that the government needs to provide more money to fund the scheme. The requirement too is likely to be high given that November-March months need to be budgeted for in 2021-22. In a statement, the rural development ministry said the government is committed to providing funds for the scheme, which is demand-driven, and added that similar situation has arisen in the past too. “In the previous financial year, the ministry of finance had allocated Rs 50,000 crore additional funds for the scheme, over and above that of budget estimates,” it said. As on day, MGNREGS has generated 222.16 crore person days of work. While the work generated in the pre-pandemic normal year of 2019-20 was 265.35 crore person days, in contrast, the work generated in the wake of the Covid onslaught in 2020-21 was 389.17 crore person days. Given that money would be required immediately to keep the scheme going, either the finance ministry will have to contribute or the government will wait to pass supplementary grants in the Parliament session to be convened in November. In case of latter option, the state governments will have to use the money from their budget, a situation which they generally disapprove of given their own financial constraints. What stands out in the scheme’s performance this year is that the demand for work under the MGNREGS is going to be high like 2020-21 when pandemic struck, suggesting that job generation in the formal and informal sectors has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. What may have upset estimates is that three months after the budget was moved, the country was jolted by the second wave of the pandemic that resulted in lock downs lasting nearly two months. While the total expenditure in 2020-21 was Rs 1,11,443 crore, the Centre decided to slash the budget for the scheme to around Rs 71,000 crore for the current year. The total expenditure in 2019-20 was Rs 68,265 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-more-months-to-go-nregs-2021-fund-already-exhausted/articleshow/87410135.cms||---

This is the second non-bailable warrant against the officer. The court also dismissed API Sachin Waze’s application seeking stay on production of a warrant against him. Waze, who was arrested in planting of gelatin sticks and Mansukh Hiran’s murder case, underwent a heart bypass surgery last month and now a medical team report had given them the green signal to take his custody from Taloja jail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/second-nbw-against-param-bir-singh/articleshow/87410962.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||India||Make SCs, STs active stakeholder in court proceedings, says SC||NEW DELHI: Observing that people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes continue to “face insurmountable hurdles in accessing justice from the stage of filing the complaint to the conclusion of the trial”, the Supreme Court on Friday said they must be made an active stakeholder in criminal proceedings and it is mandatory to keep victims of offences under the SC/ST Act informed about the court proceedings against accused and be allowed to be heard. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna said Section 15A was incorporated into the SC/ST Act 2015 to enable members of marginalised castes to be informed about court proceedings, including about the bail of an accused, to “effectively pursue the case and counteract the effects of defective investigations”. The court said the victim or dependent has the right to be heard and ruled that the provision is mandatory which “must be scrupulously observed”. Section 15A(3) of SC/ST Act says, a victim or his dependent shall have the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any court proceeding, including any bail proceeding and the special public prosecutor or the state government shall inform the victim about any proceedings under this Act. It added, “We also emphasize that Sub-section (3) of Section 15A provides that a reasonable and timely notice must be issued to the victim or their dependent. This would entail that the notice is served upon victims or their dependents at the first or earliest possible instance. If undue delay is caused in the issuance of notice, the victim, or as the case may be, their dependents, would remain uninformed of the progress made in the case and it would prejudice their rights to effectively oppose the defence of the accused. It would also ultimately delay the bail proceedings or the trial.” The SC said victims are often relegated to the role of being a spectator in the criminal justice system and they often face significant hurdles during investigation and prosecution. “But SCs and STs... suffer on account of procedural lapses in the criminal justice system,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-scs-sts-active-stakeholder-in-court-proceedings-says-sc/articleshow/87411191.cms||---

After inducting the seven MLAs into the party fold, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said BJP should now change its slogan from ‘Mera parivar BJP parivar’ to ‘mera parivar bhaagta parivar’. The BSP MLAs who joined SP included Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Sushma Patel, Aslam Chaudhary, Hargovind Bhargava and Aslam Raini. All were suspended from BSP in October 2020 for anti-party activities after they came in contact with the ‘backroom boys’ of SP with plans to shift loyalties. BJP MLA from Sitapur, Rajkesh Rathore, who has been vocal against his own government for quite some time on the issues of law and order and handling of pandemic, also joined SP. Later, Akhilesh questioned the claims of Union home minister Amit Shah that BJP has fulfilled 90% of the promises it had made in the Sankalp Patra (manifesto) ahead of the 2017 assembly polls. “On the very first page of the Sankalp Patra, BJP promised that farmers’ income will be doubled. Has it been doubled,” he asked. He said BJP promised to strengthen the system of mandis to help farmers sell their produce easily but the government increased the rate of fertilisers, electricity and fuel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ahead-of-up-polls-6-rebel-bsp-mlas-bjp-lawmaker-join-sp/articleshow/87411315.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral quoted the former chief minister as saying: “The decision to part ways with the party was taken after much thought and is final. I am grateful to party chief Sonia Gandhi for her support but will not stay in Congress now. I will launch my own party and hold talks for seat-sharing with the BJP, breakaway Akali factions and others for the coming Punjab elections once the farmers’ issue is resolved.” The ex-CM said he wanted to build a strong collective force in the interest of Punjab and its farmers. Even though the response to his idea is said to be below his expectation, the Congress is wary of his next political move and wants to keep its flock together.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-backend-talks-with-congress-capt-amarinder/articleshow/87411189.cms||---

He has also been fined Rs 30,000, which will be given to the survivor as compensation. The woman, who was 20 when the crime was committed, was abducted and gang-raped in 2008, and Sagar was made a co-accused in the case. Though the police had filed a closure report in Sagar's favour, the case was reopened by a sessions court in 2010. It was then transferred to the MP/MLA court for speedy trial under supervision of the Supreme Court. The judgment on Saturday was pronounced by additional district judge Akhilesh Kumar after he found Sagar guilty under IPC sections 376 D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Sagar’s son is a sitting BJP MLA from Bisauli constituency in Budaun. "My daughter is now married.

Who becomes the CM and for how many terms is a different matter,” he said. He had earlier not only spoken about becoming CM again but also named a colleague that he thought deserved to retain a particular portfolio for the fourth time. “I will make (Shanti) Dhariwal ji minister of the same department (urban development and housing). He will be the UDH minister for the fourth time,” he said. On Saturday, he said it was up to the masses to decide who should be the CM and for how many times. “You (people) made me the CM for the third time. I respect and acknowledge that,” he said. At this point, someone shouted, "Chauthi baar bhi (fourth time again)." Gehlot responded with a smile and a quipped, "Chauthi baar toh kya? Mai-baap toh aap baithe ho (Why only the fourth time?

The TMC supremo said Congress had squandered several opportunities to take on BJP, because of which the country is suffering. “I can’t say everything right now, but it (Congress) didn’t take things seriously in politics. Modi is going to be more powerful because of Congress,” she said. Though TMC had responded to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s overtures to like-minded parties, Mamata appeared to rue the lack of quick decision-making by the principal opposition party. Banerjee has announced that her party has set its eyes on contesting the state assembly elections in Tripura, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Goa ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections. The West Bengal-based outfit is trying to increase its national footprint as it looks to take on BJP at the national level. “If one can’t take a decision, why should the country suffer for thatshe said. “I welcome regional and local parties — who are committed to fight against BJP— to work with us,” she added. ” She also criticised Congress for contesting against her in the West Bengal polls. “Instead of contesting against BJP, they have contested against me in my state. What do they expect? That they will contest against me and I will give them two flowers?” said Banerjee. She said while she does not want the anti-BJP vote to be divided, at the same time, she doesn’t want to wait “for Congress to get its act together”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indecisive-congress-makes-modi-stronger-says-west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/87411506.cms||Newton Sequeira

"I got the booster shot, and I want to encourage everyone to do the same when you are eligible," Harris said after receiving her third dose of the Moderna vaccine at the White House. "What we have said from the beginning: It's safe and free," she said. Harris said that over 90 percent of Americans in intensive care units or who have died of Covid were unvaccinated. "So let's get vaccinated and we will get through the pandemic," she said. Many Americans are still resisting vaccinations, with only 58 percent of the population fully immunized. The United States has recorded over 745,000 deaths from Covid-19. US health authorities have approved booster shots of the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The boosters should be administered six months after the second dose to people aged 65 or older, as well as to people aged 18-64 who are either at high risk of severe Covid-19 or with frequent exposure to the virus due to the nature of their job. Fifty-seven-year-old Harris had received her first two injections in December 2020 and January 2021, according to the White House. She is considered at risk of contracting Covid due to her official duties. US President Joe Biden, 78, received his third dose of the vaccine in September.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-vp-kamala-harris-gets-covid-19-booster-shot/articleshow/87411801.cms||---

Malleshappa’s son had died by suicide after jumping out of a window. Police stated that Malleshappa’s son had died after drinking too much alcohol and submitted a B report. A B Report is filed in cases where police find no evidence to pursue the investigation..Malleshappa from Dharwad, then sought information under RTI. He sought for a copy of the B report, contending that a stigma had been attached to his family as it had accused his dead son of being an alcoholic. However, the authorities decline it, saying he can secure the same from the magistrate. Thereafter, Malleshappa moved the Karnataka State information Commission, the appellate authority.The State Information Commissioner noted that there is a bar on providing information only when the matter is under investigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-bar-on-giving-b-report-under-rti-if-probe-over-hc/articleshow/87412000.cms||---

The data was on eye injuries suffered because of crackers and treated in the hospital from 2008 to 2020. The hospital sets up special wards during Deepavali to treat cracker related eye injuries. Of the 646 people the hospital treated for eye injuries caused by fireworks between 2008 and 2020, 319 were children below the age of 16 years. The rest 327 cases were aged 16 years and above. Among the 319 children, the majority — 265 or 83 % — were boys and girls accounted only for 17 % or 54 of the cases. The trend was similar among adults too, men accounted for 86 % of the injuries. Though the number of cracker-related eye injuries has declined over the years, what worries ophthalmologists at the hospital is the fact that injured children suffered a loss of vision at a tender age. In 2020, the hospital came across sixteen children among the total 31 cases. Three patients lost vision in one eye, including a two-year-old boy. Hospital director Dr Sujata L Rathod said the loss of vision depends on the severity of the injury. However, there was no data available on how many of the total patients had lost vision. “If a child becomes blind, s/he has to go through many years of blindness, which affects his/her overall growth,” she said, adding that legislation banning crackers is the only solution to stop cracker related to eye injuries. According to hospital authorities, 60% of the cracker-related eye injuries are self-inflicted, whereas 40 % are injuries suffered by innocent bystanders. A team of ophthalmic surgeons used to visit schools and conduct workshops, educating children and teachers about not burning crackers during the festival, but this has stopped for the last two years because of the pandemic. This year too, the hospital has set up wards with a total of 90 beds for cracker injury cases, with 30 beds each for men, women and children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/49-eye-injury-victims-are-children-below-16/articleshow/87412002.cms||Sunitha Rao R

With the first-year degree classes kicking off in many top colleges on lines with National Education Policy (NEP), students are picking up a variety of courses that are being offered as open electives. As per the NEP, students can choose open electives from other streams apart from the departments they are enrolled in. Many autonomous colleges asked each department to come up with elective courses that can be pursued by students of any stream.  The four popular electives in Jyoti Nivas College are Nutrition for physical and mental health; photography and visual storytelling; German; and contemporary dance movements and practice. At St Joseph's College of Commerce, the favourites are gender and leadership; event management; cricket and cinema; disaster management and social justice. Mount Carmel College is offering 37 courses as electives, with an intake of 60 students each. The seats will be filled in on a first come, first served basis. As the student portal opened, students could register for the courses. For those who missed out, the subjects will be available next semester. The courses are as diverse as cultural diversity at workplace to electronics for everyone, financial mathematics, entrepreneurial botany, democracy and media, and e-business and retailing. “The courses offered by the economics department -- markets and government policy; politics and impact on business were filled in fast. Economics is popular across arts, science and commerce students. Social entrepreneurship, fashion and image management, web technology, chemistry in daily life, stock market operations, digital marketing were other popular courses that got good response,” said Raghu VN, spokesperson of the college. NMKRV College for Women principal Snehalatha Nadiger said many are trying to play it safe and not opting for radical changes . A faculty at Maharani’s College for Science, now under Maharani Cluster University, said biotechnology and statistics are the favourite choices. At RC College of Commerce, around 70% of students have chosen accounting. The other popular choices are personal finance and planning, people management and rural development. Surana College principal Bhavani MR said the college will have a consortium of neighbourhood colleges to help each other to offer maximum courses as possible. “Our college has a wide variety of subjects. In case a neighbourhood college wants to offer one of those courses, we are ready to welcome its students. Similarly, we can send our students to their colleges too..” Several colleges said they are awaiting full syllabus from the universities in open electives so that they can allow students to make informed choices. “While the syllabus of the core disciplines are here, those of many core electives are yet to come,” said a principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dance-cricket-cinema-colleges-offer-a-bouquet-of-courses-for-open-electives/articleshow/87412003.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Centre’s rule on overhead cables puts BBMP in bind||BENGALURU: Bengaluru, which is reeling under the menace of overhead lines, is set to be further crisscrossed by cables with the Centre permitting service providers to draw overground optical fibre (OFC). While the move is to enhance digital infrastructure and faster internet connectivity, it has put BBMP in a fix since the high court has directed the civic agency to remove all overhead cables. The department of telecommunication (DoT) has amended the Indian Telegraph Right of Way (RoW) rules allowing overhead OFC lines with a lifetime licence fee of Rs 1,000 per km. So far, laying OFC lines has been confined to underground and the Centre has asked all states to comply with the new rules as the general observation is that the civil works entailed in the process of laying underground cable is causing delay. However, the new rules come at a time when BBMP is complying with the HC order and the case is still pending. The city has 25,000km of overhead cables dangling and overlapping. The commutative length of underground cable is just about 5,000km. And the worry is that the length of overhead cables is likely to increase exponentially making the underground less preferred. “Overhead cables are likely to pose a bigger problem of frequent internet outage as they get snapped due to rain and wind. While this poses a maintenance challenge, it disrupts business continuity,” urbanist V Ravichandar said. “The overhead cables are only a temporary arrangement and we have regularised to enable the service providers to provide connections quickly and it is imperative when working from home is becoming the norm. The service providers will provide the connections through underground cables since it is the permanent feature,” said a senior DoT official. Even cable operators and internet service providers acknowledge the concerns as they urge the state to come up with comprehensive and clear-cut guidelines that help both service providers and citizens. “It was a long-pending demand. We are happy that it has been done now,” said Patrick Raju, president of Karnataka State Cable TV Operators Association. Naresh V Narasimhan urban designer, said: “This is only a temporary issue since the emerging technology of satellite-based internet will eliminate the cables. Till then the government should ensure a balance between adequate broadband connectivity and safety.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/centres-rule-on-overhead-cables-puts-bbmp-in-bind/articleshow/87412006.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Mizoram officials said Laldintluanga Ralte of the India Reserve Police’s 1st Battalion was picked up while he was on duty at Zophai in the border district of Kolasib. He was taken to the Ramnathpur police station before being shifted to the Barak Valley town of Hailakandi. The officer-in-charge of Bairabi police station in Mizoram said the constable had been booked under sections 447 (trespass) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. He is likely to be out on bail after being produced in a Hailakandi court, the officer said. There was no official statement from Assam police about the arrest of the Mizo constable. Members of the student organisation Mizo Zirlai Pawl blocked NH-154, which connects Hailakandi district with Mizoram, from 4pm and clamped an “indefinite curfew” on movement of people from Bairabi town of Assam. On Friday morning, a resident of Mizoram was killed after being allegedly robbed of Rs 1 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fresh-border-row-as-assam-arrests-mizoram-cop/articleshow/87412017.cms||HC Vanlalruata
---||India||Stop forced conversion, people must declare faith change: RSS||DHARWAD: The RSS said on Saturday that forced religious conversion should stop and those who change their faith should announce it. The Sangh also said it would welcome the passing of any anti-conversion bill. “People who are converted have to announce that they have converted. There are people who get converted and do not disclose that they have converted. They take double benefits,” RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale said at a press conference here. He was talking to reporters at the conclusion of the three-day Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM) meeting here. He said the RSS per se was not opposed to voluntary conversion from one religion to another but the forced conversion by minority communities just to increase their numbers was not acceptable. The opposition by minority communities to the anti-conversion law reveals their intention. Already 10 states have passed the law and so has the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh. In Karnataka, let the law be passed. If there are shortcomings, amendments can be made. It is not correct to oppose the law even before it is passed," Hosabale said. Replying to a question on Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting Pope, the RSS functionary said there was nothing wrong in the PM of a country meeting dignitaries or heads of other countries as that would enhance India’s prestige. To a query on the population policy, Hosabale said every nation should have a population policy that should be applicable to all. He added that the Sangh had passed a resolution to this effect a few years ago. To another question, Hosabale said the BJP-led central government has already stated that it will bring a uniform civil code and hoped that it would keep its word. Asked about the proposal to ban firecrackers during Deepavali, he said environmental protection is a major concern and should be an ongoing activity. "Why does this question arise only during Deepavali? If it is to be banned there should be a comprehensive plan. Banning crackers just ahead of the festival will lead to a major loss to manufacturers and traders and hit those working in cracker factories," he said. Hosabale, reacting to Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s remark that moral policing is a reaction to an action, said nobody should take the law into their hands. "However, when someone’s feelings are hurt, there is bound to be a reaction. But that does not justify taking the law into their hands" he asserted. RSS shakhas across the country which were not fully operational during the Covid-19 will now resume activities in full swing while following Covid protocol. The RSS has also planned to expand its activities to areas that did not have its shakhas. In Nagaland and Mizoram, the percentage of Hindu population is very small and hence the number of shakhas is small there. In Meghalaya, the RSS is engaged in social service while in Ladakh there is a shakha. Lakshadweep has a unit that meets once in a week, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stop-forced-conversion-people-must-declare-faith-change-rss/articleshow/87412095.cms||---

The critically injured ABVP member, identified as Shivaji Sengupta, was attacked during a confrontation with a group outside R K Institution in Kailashahar, where the student organisation had organised a membership drive. Police said the situation in the district was already tense after a mosque was allegedly damaged by alleged supporters of local BJP MLA Sudhangshu Das at Palbazar. In an allegedly retaliatory attack, a temple in the Kubjar area of Kailashahar was vandalised later. Minister Baghaban Das, CPI-M MLA Mabaswar Ali and senior Congress leader Badrujaman visited the area to placate the residents. The subdivisional administration, too, initiated peace meetings with community leaders to restore normalcy and repair the damage caused to the mosque and the temple. The police have banned any religious meeting, rally or congregation across the state. Security has been beefed up in and around shrines and areas with a mixed population.

Counting of votes will be held on November 2. While Tarapur recorded 49% polling, 50.04% voters turned up in Kusheshwar Asthan. In 2020, Tarapur had recorded 54.43% polling while it was 55.8% in Kusheshwar Asthan. The state election commission officials said a heavy turnout was seen in the last one hour of voting, which started at 7am and concluded at 4pm at 716 polling booths. The bypolls were necessitated following the deaths of the sitting JD(U) MLAs. The state election commission sources said the voting percentage in Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan was even less than the 2015 assembly polls in which an average 51.92% voters had exercised their franchise. The stake in the bypolls is high for the major political parties like the ruling JD(U), RJD, Congress and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas). The Congress, which had fought the previous assembly election in alliance with RJD and Left parties, has gone solo on both the seats this time. Altogether 17 candidates — nine in Tarapur and eight in Kusheshwar Asthan — are in the fray. The SEC officials revealed that there were 1,506 service voters, including 75 women. Altogether 974 control units, 1,002 ballot units and 1,053 VVPAT were used on the two seats. Two general observers, expenditure observers and police observers were deputed to ensure free and fair election. In addition, the commission had deployed 110 micro observers. In all, nine model polling booths were set up. The arrangements for webcasting were made for 318 polling booths. At the auxiliary polling booths, women polling as well as security personnel were deployed to help the voters. Home guard jawan dies A home guard jawan, identified as Pradip Mandal, died of cardiac arrest ahead of the polling at booth number 337 on Sangrampur block premises in Tarapur assembly segment in Munger district on Saturday. Sangrampur police station SHO Sarvajeet Kumar said Mandal was deployed for election duty but died of cardiac arrest about half an hour before the start of the voting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/49-59-voter-turnout-in-tarapur-k-asthan/articleshow/87406466.cms||Ramashankar

Recent spike in Covid cases in the UK, Russia, Indonesia, Syria, Romania and some other countries besides some Indian states, including West Bengal, has caused concern among the health experts. Experts feel the emergence of new variants of the Coronavirus at different places poses a threat to the people. Some of the new variants are capable of escaping the vaccine immunity, they say. Covid in-charge at AIIMS-Patna. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, say the new delta variant (Ay. 4.2 ) is highly transmissible and has been found even in some parts of India, including Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. It may also enter Bihar as a large number of people from different states would be coming home during the Chhath festival. Recent rise in Covid cases in West Bengal clearly reflects the transmission of the virus during Durga Puja celebration crowd in Kolkata and elsewhere. He cautioned the people against the danger of getting infected with the new strains of Coronavirus if they failed to follow the Covid norms during the festival. Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC)’s joint director Dr A K Ashu said the pandemic fear is still there in Bihar and any laxity on the part of the people may cause havoc. Even vaccinated people need to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour as the new mutations of Coronavirus is still not understood clearly. Mingling of people coming from other states with the local population during Chhath may spike Covid cases. Moreover, even the efficacy of vaccines in respect of the new mutants has not been studied properly so far, he said. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah observed that at least 13,000 people have reportedly died due to Covid in Asia in the last 24 hours. Unless the chain of transmission breaks completely, the fear of pandemic would continue. He said 60 countries have less than 2% of their population vaccinated. “No one is safe, unless everyone is safe,” he said. Nalanda Medical College Hospital’s deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar, however, asserted that there is no immediate cause of concern in Bihar as not a single case with the new delta variant has been reported recently. With more and more people getting vaccinated with both the doses, the state is prepared to tackle the onset of any new variant of the virus. He, however, appealed to the people to remain alert and follow the Vovid-appropriate behaviour. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Uday Krishna Jha said people must be cautious of the imminent danger during the Chhath festival. People from every nook and corner of the country come to Bihar to participate in this pious festival and more often than not they congregate on the banks of rivers and ponds. Everyone coming from outside the state, especially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka, must be tested for Covid properly at the place of their arrival itself. People must wear face masks while moving out of their homes, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/dont-let-your-guard-down-against-covid-experts-warn/articleshow/87406334.cms||B K Mishra

The district legal services authority (DLSA) of Aurangabad has inducted them on ad hoc basis. They have started working in various areas of the district from Saturday. West Bengal and Jharkhand had taken such a step, the DLSA sources said. Recently, Bihar became one of the few states in the country to induct transgenders in its police force. The transgenders were inducted at a special programme organised for them in Aurangabad on Friday. District judge Manoj Kumar Tiwari and other judicial officers were present on the occasion. Aurangabad DLSA secretary Pranaw Shankar, who is an additional district judge rank officer, told TOI over phone on Saturday that the transgenders were imparted a one-hour training on Friday to make them aware about the works of DLSA and the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and how they can help the needy people. “The reason to induct them is that they keep moving continuously and reach the remote areas. Once they work dedicatedly, they will be permanently inducted into Aurangabad DLSA by March next year,” he said. Shankar said the transgenders have immense knowledge about large number of people, who are in desperate need of assistance but are helpless. The judicial officers were surprised when the transgenders apprised them about several needy persons after they were told how DLSA volunteers and panel lawyers work for extending help to old-age people or physically challenged persons in getting benefits of the government scheme like pension, tricycles and other legal aid free of cost. At present, the transgenders have been asked to increase awareness among the villagers about getting births and deaths registered. The idea was given by the Aurangabad district judge. They have also been handed over pamphlets and other materials printed with information for distribution in villages to create awareness. The Aurangabad DLSA, which has around 50 panel lawyers and around 100 para-legal volunteers, has plans to increase the count of transgenders working for them if this step succeeds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nine-transgenders-roped-in-as-para-legal-volunteers-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87406490.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Parents in a fix after Amma Vodi aid linked to attendance||AMARAVATI: The state government’s decision to grant financial assistance under Amma Vodi scheme by making 75 per cent attendance mandatory has come as a bolt from the blue for parents and private educational institutions. Since the government has decided to pay the grant for the current academic year after the reopening of schools during the next academic year, the private educational institutions have already started exerting pressure on the parents to clear the entire fee right at the time of admission. Notwithstanding the instructions of the government and recommendations of the fee regulatory commission, private educational institutions are charging hefty fees from the students, particularly in the wake of the government’s decision to defer the payment under Amma Vodi to the next academic year. Parents are struggling to manage the situation as many institutions are charging anywhere around Rs 20,000 for classes below class-V and Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 thousands for classes VI-X. The state cabinet chaired by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday endorsed the move to pay the Rs 15,000 assistance under the Amma Vodi scheme to the mothers of schoolgoing children next June. The 75 per cent attendance will be calculated of the total 130 working days between November and April, and is a must to get the benefit. While the 75 per cent attendance rule was included in the criteria for getting the benefit under the scheme right at its launch in 2020, the state government had exempted the rule in two consecutive academic years keeping in view the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy released the amounts in January in two successive years at public meetings. By the second year, the government had also announced an offer to give laptops for students in classes VIII-X in lieu of the Amma Vodi cash incentive. The relaxation given in the last two years came as a big relief for parents as educational institutions granted admissions without insisting on payment of fees, anticipating parents would clear the dues after getting financial assistance under Amma Vodi in January. Both parents and managements were jubilant at the government’s decision to grant the benefit to children in private schools. However, the private managements changed their tack after the government decided to release Amma Vodi assistance next June, and insisted parents pay the entire fee immediately. “Any educational institution can’t demand to pay the entire fee in one go. They must collect the fee in installments and also follow the fees prescribed by the fee regulatory commission. We will take stringent action if anyone is found violating the rule,” said education minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh. He, however, defended the move to link Amma Vodi aid with attendance, stating that the purpose of launching the scheme was to improve enrolment in schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/parents-in-a-fix-after-amma-vodi-aid-linked-to-attendance/articleshow/87407390.cms||Samdani MN
---||Ahmedabad||Pharma products' approvals in Gujarat rise as firms expand portfolios||AHMEDABAD: With a strong demand growth in the healthcare space and people focusing more on preventative care after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, pharma companies are adding more drugs and products to their existing portfolios. As a result, there has been a substantial jump in product approvals granted to manufacture medicines in Gujarat. For instance: Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) in September issued 5,494 licences to make different allopathic drugs and products. Except January and April, the number of product permissions provided to pharma firms every month has hovered above the 5,000-mark this year, shows data compiled by the FDCA-Gujarat. “The number of product licences issued every month was around 2,500 to 3,000 before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The monthly product licence issuances have gone up by 1 to 1.5 times recently,” said Dr H G Koshia, commissioner, FDCA-Gujarat. The issuance of fresh product licences started increasing after the pandemic and crossed the monthly mark of 5,000 in 2021. New product licences totalling 5,601, 5,324, 5,488 and 5,421 were issued by the state FDCA in April, May, June, July and August, respectively. The number stood at 5,095 in February and 5,123 in March this year. The product approvals were low at 3,981 and 3,725 in January and April, respectively, reveal the state FDCA data. As many as 48,909 product permissions have been issued by the state FDCA so far this year. “While healthcare and pharmaceutical have seen strong growth, the people have started focusing more on preventive rather than curative care after the pandemic. Hence, pharma companies are adding more and more preventive drugs to their existing list of the products,” added Koshia. The spurt in new product permissions is also largely supported by the heavy rush of companies to come up with products and therapies used in the treatment of the Covid-19. These also include making vitamins, nutrients, Covid-19 drugs and their raw materials, said pharmaceutical industry players. While exports of pharmaceuticals have been robust ever since the pandemic struck, the domestic market growth has also bounced back strongly. This has prompted more and more companies to launch their products to cater to the growing demand, added industry players.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pharma-products-approvals-in-guj-rise-as-firms-expand-portfolios/articleshow/87407140.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Visakhapatnam||Second wave in state leaves economic activity unscathed||Visakhapatnam: The record jump in Covid-19 cases during the peak of the second wave pushed the health infrastructure of Andhra Pradesh to the brink. But its impact seems to have been moderate on economic activity, compared to the first wave, if the high frequency indicators like electricity consumption, mobility, economic value of agriculture markets, etc. are anything to go by. For instance, electricity consumption had nosedived to 1,725 GWh (gigawatt hours) in June 2020 in Andhra Pradesh. It peaked to 5,676 GWh by May 2021, as per an analysis done based on data from the power system operation corporation limited by ‘India Data Portal’, an open data-driven initiative of the Bharati Institute of Public Policy of the Indian School of Business (ISB). The economic value of the items traded in the agricultural markets of the state had plummeted to Rs 48 crore in April 2020. This increased to Rs 869 crore by March 2021. The number of new companies registered in Andhra Pradesh in the first three months of the onset of the pandemic (March, April and May 2020) had not crossed the 200-mark. The registrations during the second wave, which is considered to have begun in the second half March 2021 in Andhra Pradesh, has not come down the 300-mark in any month in the last six months – from March 2021 to September 2021. Similarly, community mobility dropped by 58% in April 2020 compared to 34% gap in May 20201 (the peak month of the second wave). India Data Portal prepared a baseline mobility data by calculating the median value from the five-week period – between January 3 and February 6, 2020. When it comes to percentage of change in community mobility pertaining to grocery and pharmacy visits, Andhra Pradesh witnessed a 45% drop compared to the median value. By March 2021, it was about 33% above the median value. The number of digital payment transactions in India had taken a serious plunge to 227.57 crore in June 2020. Digital transactions showed resilience during the second wave to quickly cross the 402 crore mark in June 2021. The Covid-19 second wave caused havoc in Andhra Pradesh in April-May 2021. The state reported 5.9 lakh cases in May alone, with hospitals choking with patients. This can be better understood from the fact that the state recorded only some nine lakh cases in the first wave (from March 2020 to February 2021). The scenes of relatives making rounds around the hospitals for an oxygen bed or the patients themselves waiting outside the hospitals on oxygen support had become common occurrences in May-June 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/second-wave-in-state-leaves-economic-activity-unscathed/articleshow/87407214.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Of seven schools in the country, the Union government has approved their project that focuses on making water from the moisture available in the air. Not just that. The controller general of patents (designs and trademarks) has issued an intellectual property certificate to Zila School and Niti Aayog directed Dell and Learning Links Foundation to launch the project in the market. ATL in-charge Devendra Singh, who guided the three students, told this reporter, “The ‘Air Water Generator’ developed by Prem Sagar, Pritam Kumar, and Shreya Sinha will ensure availability of drinking water in dry zones like Gaya. It will also ensure water availability in hilly areas.” Altogether seven schools from different parts of the country had applied for a patent on their projects. After several rounds of testing, the controller general of patents approved the project of Zila School in Gaya. “The project, which began in 2018, was completed in 2019. It was then sent to Manipal University for testing and approval,” school principal Sudarshan Sharma said, adding that President Ram Nath Kovind had felicitated Devendra and the three students involved in the project on the occasion of Children’s Day on November 14, 2019. Sharing details of the ‘Air Water Generator’, the principal continued, “The machine operates from power as well as manually. Materials like condenser, capacitor, fan, inductor, and semiconductor were used while making it. Now, efforts are being made to ensure that the machine functions with the help of solar energy and generates four to five litres of water per hour.” The principal also thanked Gaya DM-cum-Zila School chairman Abhishek Singh for his help.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/gaya-school-pupils-project-gets-intellectual-property-certificate/articleshow/87406369.cms||---

Excerpts: How do you rate India’s performance in fighting Covid and compare it with the West? Given the size and diversity of our population, I think we have done extremely well. Reaching out to everybody was a huge task, but the way doctors, frontline workers, paramedical and the government worked together kept our mortality rate very low in comparison to the rest of the world. The second wave, of course, was devastating. Earlier, average requirement of oxygen was 2200 tonne/day, which increased to 20,000 tonne/day. There were lots of struggle, anxiety, running around, but I think we did quite well. Now, if vaccination is the only tool against this deadly Covid, we have crossed 100 crore doses. Policymakers and developers of vaccines did an amazing job. Don’t you think Covid has exposed the lack of attention on the health sector in India? Otherwise, why people living in Bihar need to go to Delhi or other states for treatment. Even those staying in Katihar need to come to Patna? There is definitely a need for developing the healthcare infrastructure in the Tier II and III cities. It requires three things. First, if you work on the civic amenities, you reduce the disease burden and we need to work on this. India has double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. We can at least try to limit the communicable diseases while educating people how to avoid non-communicable lifestyle diseases. The second one is wellness, which comes with institutions like wellness centres that the government is planning to open and doing. With such centres at the village level, people can get treatment very early. Third is to provide actual medical facilities. Tertiary care hospitals have been developed in the metros only. But Tier II and III cities are slow in developing multi-speciality hospitals. It all comes down to economics. If you are building on a private space, it must survive. The government is making every effort to build more medical college and hospitals, but the need is huge and we have to double the number of beds, doctors and nurses. The government has been pretty receptive to our suggestions. Now the good side of Covid has been that it brought everything in focus. We won the Covid battle together. Let’s stay together, the government and private healthcare providers. A poor family has to spend a huge amount on treatment, forcing them to sell their properties. What health plan do you suggest to the government? The government has already put in a lot of schemes. Ayushman is already there, which is making 50 crore people able to access healthcare. There are schemes like employees’ state insurance scheme, ex-servicemen contributory health scheme and private insurance. Coverage is increasing, but it needs to go higher. There are private as well as government hospitals in Patna. How will Medanta be different? First thing is that we create an infrastructure where patients can be treated with complete safety, there is enough air circulation, space and proper sanitization. The second thing is to provide the highest end of technology. Third is we hire doctors on three principals — they should be benchmarked to be the best in the world, they must have reached a stage where they are willing to develop further and teach and train other people so that the chain increases, and they must have impeccable integrity. No doctor touches money in Medanta. It all goes to the hospital account and the hospital gives them cheque after paying tax. If you put this all together, it is equivalent to the best in the world. That is what Medanta has been. Any plan to expand further? This is the first and we will have more.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/govt-and-pvt-healthcare-providers-should-work-together/articleshow/87407771.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The song ‘Aisan Bipatiya Aael... Barat Lagayi Paar’, which is of 4 minutes and 22 seconds, has already attracted 47,901 views and 393 comments till 8pm on Saturday. In the end of the song, the singer also requests people to take both doses of vaccine against the Covid-19 at the earliest in order to defeat the pandemic. The videos aim to create public awareness towards Covid appropriate behaviour and importance of vaccination in the war against the pandemic. The song is a part of the ongoing public service announcement (PSA) series under the title of ‘Zara Sochiye’ (just think), which focuses on Covid safety behaviour during the upcoming festivals. So far, 13 informative and educational videos have already been released under this PSA series to encourage people to get jabbed and create public awareness as well. Sinha said this devotional song is a message to urge devotees to celebrate this festival by adhering to Covid-19 protocols. “There is no restriction on going to the ghats in this song, but my message to people is to celebrate this festival with accountability and responsibility. Chhath should be celebrated with safety as coronavirus is still there. So, I appeal people to wear masks, use hand sanitiser and also take vaccine against the Covid-19, if they have not taken yet,” she said. “Those who have health issues should avoid going to ghats. They should perform rituals at their homes in artificial ponds,” she advised. The singer admired the Centre and the MOHFW’s approach for the appeal to spread awareness against Covid-19 through devotional song. “I wish that Chhathi Maiya will help us in these difficult times,” Sinha said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/shardas-song-appeals-to-follow-cov-19-protocols/articleshow/87407945.cms||Faryal Rumi

Foundry and engineering units in Rajkot, Jamnagar and other parts of the state are also mulling similar steps amid spiralling raw material costs, said industry players. There are about 1,500 foundry units and 10,000 engineering units — small, medium and large — around Ahmedabad. “With production getting increasingly unviable due to the hike in raw material prices as well as their availability, several of our member units have decided to extend Diwali vacation by voluntarily halting production for 15 to 20 days. Usually, our units remain closed for 6-7 days in Diwali,” said Ashok Patel, president, Ahmedabad Engineering Manufacturers’ Association. “We expect that nearly 5,000 units — 1,500 foundries and 3,500 engineering units — will join this voluntary shutdown. About 15% of these units have already closed and more are likely to join in next few days,” added Patel. Talking about the price surge in raw materials used by foundries, Patel added that the per kilogram prices of pig iron have jumped from Rs 30-32 per kg to 51-52 per kg in eight months, while coal prices have shot up from Rs 25 to Rs 52 per kg in two months. “Our suppliers have stopped providing raw materials on credit. As a result, CI castings (cast iron) made by these foundries have seen its price skyrocket to Rs 75-80 per kg from Rs 48-52 per kg previously,” added Patel. These castings are used in making parts of machineries across industries. According to industry players, engineering units are finding it difficult to procure castings at such high prices as they are also facing price rise in steel, copper and other raw materials. Hence, castings production has declined to 60% now. “When raw material cost rise is unbearable and business has also gone down, units are left with no option but to close for some time,” said Patel. The situation is similar in Rajkot, Vadodara, Jamnagar and other parts of the state. When contacted Paresh Vasani, president, Rajkot Engineering Association, said that many units are planning to opt for Diwali vacation of 10-12 days in the wake of coal shortage and high raw material prices. However, the decision to stop production is left to individual units and no decision has been taken at the association level, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/5k-abad-foundries-engg-units-mull-15-day-shutdown/articleshow/87407924.cms||---
---||Patna||FUTAB: I-T relief issue on PF contributions may be resolved||PATNA: The dispute over the validity of Provident Fund (PF) accounts of universities and colleges in Bihar for income tax exemptions is likely to be resolved soon. The income tax department has reportedly agreed to discuss the matter with the teachers’ representatives and take proper action soon. According to the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar (FUTAB), whose delegation met the I-T officials here on Friday, the department in February 2020 had disallowed the university staff to avail any relief u/s 80C of the I-T Act, 1960. It also disallowed any claim made by the employees u/s 10 of the Act on the interest received from such prevalent PF schemes in the state universities. FUTAB working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, said the teachers and non-teaching staff of universities and colleges are governed by either the Patna University Act, 1976 or Bihar State Universities Act, 1976, with almost common service statutes, including regarding the retirement benefits. These provisions are in operation since 1960 with amendment in 1976 and certain changes thereafter. They further said as the grants are released to the universities from the consolidated fund of the state government, the PF contributions are from these funds only. Under the existing practice, the university or its college opens a separate joint savings bank account of each employee with the head of the institution, where 10% of the employee’s salary and 10% of the employer’s contribution are deposited as PF contributions. The interest on the savings bank account is earned by the respective employee for the said PF deposit. Earlier, FUTAB had written to the I-T authorities that there was nothing wrong with the PF deductions in colleges and universities, as all these accounts were with nationalized banks and have been declared equivalent to government PF accounts, as per the provisions of the Acts and statutes. But, ignoring the federation’s request, the I-T department served notices on several teachers and non-teaching staff regarding identification of “high-value information, which does not appear to be in line with their income tax returns filed for assessment year 2020-21 (relating to financial year 2019-20)”. The teachers were asked to revise their ITRs and submit online responses on the compliance portal, they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/futab-i-t-relief-issue-on-pf-contributions-may-be-resolved/articleshow/87407799.cms||B K Mishra

Sharan expressed his concern over lack of proper sanitation on the premises of the hospital which has been converted into a centre for vaccination against Covid-19 in the district. He also directed the officials to intensify the second dose of vaccination. During his inspection, the CS asked the civil surgeon and the other officials to identity the people who have not received their second dose yet. He asked district magistrate Pranav Kumar to monitor the vaccination campaign on a regular basis. Sharan emphasised on the importance of door-to-door campaign and awareness among the people of all sections of society about vaccination with a view to checking the spread of Covid.

Several localities in the past two weeks have been reporting power shutdowns twice or thrice a week, thus affecting the productivity of these professionals.The techies say these shutdowns last between 10 minutes and an hour. Viswas Nagar, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Srirangam, Thennur and Bhima Nagar have witnessed such sudden outages during daytime several days in a week. “I am supervising a team of BPO workers staying in Trichy city and suburbs. Power outage is often cited as the reason by members for suddenly pulling out of a virtual discussion,” Gajapathi R, manager of a Chennai-based BPO, said. Indeed, the trouble is restricted to a few localities while areas such as Cantonment and No 1 tollgate have not had power outages. Even though office spaces in metropolitan cities have reopened following relaxations in Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, a section of techies are continuing to work remotely. Citing monsoon and the festive season, they said they will be continuing to work from home at least till the end of the year. The shutdown has also been taking a toll on the functioning of shops that rely totally on electricity. When contacted, Tangedco officials attributed the outages to rain-related technical snags and added that there is no shortfall in power supply. “We have installed 18 new transformers in the city to avoid low voltage complaints and outages due to load factor. After Diwali, we will launch maintenance work in all the substations,” a senior official with Tangedco added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/unannounced-powercuts-upset-wfh-in-trichy/articleshow/87409519.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Patna||Bihar CM ensures proper preparations for Chhath celebrations||PATNA: Though CM Nitish Kumar personally reviews administrative alertness before every major festival in Bihar, he takes extra interest in reviewing and inspecting the preparations for the four-day Chhath Mahaparv, considered as the most pious festival across the state. Except the last year when Chhath was not observed in a grand way due to the Covid-related restrictions, every year Nitish begins inspection of Chhath ghats on the banks of the Ganga in the state capital much before Diwali, which is generally observed six days before the evening ‘arghya’ of Chhath. In Patna, the CM personally visits different ghats on the southern bank of Ganga river and ensures proper cleanliness and security arrangements for the devotees. This year, too, the CM inspected the Chhath ghats on October 27 and issued necessary instructions to the officials, especially to the Patna DM. Nitish also announced that he would again visit the Chhath ghats on November 3 to review the administrative preparations. “The CM may make one more inspection of the Patna ghats after Diwali. He has a tentative plan to inspect the Chhath ghats on November 6,” a senior official of Patna district administration told TOI on Saturday. During his inspection on October 27, the CM issued three main instructions to the officials – build ‘peepa’ bridges to ensure proper approachability to the river islands in the middle of the Ganga, barricade different ghats with bamboos to ensure safety of devotees and make some special safety arrangements around the ghats in view of increased water level in the Ganga. Acting upon the CM’s instructions, Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh has ordered deployment of adequate number of NDRF and SDRF personnel around Chhath ghats. “The Patna-based superintending engineer of the water resources department has been asked to keep a special vigil on the water level in the Ganga on daily basis,” the DM said, adding necessary arrangements would be made at the Chhath ghats. “Though there is no fixed limit on the number of visitors at any particular ghat, people have been asked to wear masks and follow other Covid-related guidelines, as the danger of virus infection cannot be ruled out completely,” said a home department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-ensures-proper-chhath-preparations/articleshow/87407901.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Take action against lawyer for cheating client: Patna HC||PATNA: The Patna high court has directed the state bar council to take appropriate action against lawyer Santosh Kumar Mishra for alleged embezzlement of Rs10.52 lakh of compensation amount given to his client couple against their only son’s death. The accused lawyer was arrested on January 5 this year and is in jail for allegedly cheating his client. A bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad also rejected Mishra’s bail petition on October 27 while observing that he, in a manner, robbed his clients. The order was uploaded the next day. ADJ-I at Buxar had earlier rejected his bail application on June 23. Lalan Pasi and his wife Sanjhariya Devi from Buxar had lost their son Gorakh Pasi in a railway accident more than four years ago. The couple belongs to scheduled castes. With Mishra’s help, they filed a claim before Railway Claims Tribunal, Patna, for compensation. The tribunal allowed the claim on January 3, 2017. However, after the compensation money was transferred into the couple's joint bank account, Mishra, taking advantage of their situation, transferred it into his own bank account as well as that of his wife Geeta Devi. Buxar police arrested him and his wife. However, she was later granted bail. Justice Prasad granted a day’s time to Mishra on October 26 to return the amount. However, Mishra’s counsel Ajit Kumar submitted that the accused may return Rs5 lakh only. The court then rejected Mishra’s bail plea considering the misappropriation of money and breach of trust of a client. Special public prosecutor (SC/ST Act) Usha Kumari opposed the bail. “Mishra had told that the money was yet not deposited. The couple then approached another lawyer. It then came to light that three separate cheques were used to transfer Rs10.52 lakh from their bank account to Mishra and his wife’s bank accounts,” she said. Following this, an FIR was registered against Mishra and his wife with Dumraon police station in early 2019. They were arrested after complete investigation and when they didn’t return the money.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hc-take-action-against-lawyer-for-cheating-client/articleshow/87406321.cms||---

Dipak Kumar Singh, the principal secretary of the department, said a letter had been issued to all DMs and forest officers. “They have been asked to be vigilant and detect any suspicious activity. All owl species are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and poaching, trade or any other form of exploitation is a punishable offence,” he told this newspaper. He added, “Through social platforms we are trying to allay the superstitious belief related to owls and make them aware about the punishment it attracts.” In a video message shared on Twitter by Singh on Saturday, he said, “Diwali is a festival to spread happiness and killing an innocent bird on this occasion is unacceptable. An owl is the ‘vaahan’ (vehicle) of Goddess Lakshmi, but some superstitious people sacrifice the bird to achieve wealth and prosperity." The DEFCC has also shared a contact number (0612-2226911) so that people can report such incidents. Despite a ban on their sale under the Wildlife Protection Act, owls are sold secretly at the pet market in Mirshikar Toli of Patna City every year during Diwali. It is the best time for poachers to earn money by selling this nocturnal bird. Owls, especially those with ears or tufts, are costlier as people think they possess magical powers. During Lakshmi Puja on Diwali night, some worshippers of Goddess Lakshmi believe that sacrificing owls wards off bad luck and ensures prosperity. Shaman or black magic practitioners, use parts or organs and blood of live owls for ceremonial pujas and rituals. Singh claimed that the DEFCC had conducted raids in Mirshikar Toli from time to time and arrested many people. “They treat this illegal business as their livelihood. Hence, we are trying to provide some alternative to them,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/remain-vigilant-stop-illegal-trade-of-owls-for-black-magic/articleshow/87405849.cms||Faryal Rumi

Some of them are located inside malls redeveloped from single screen theatres. What has further given incentive to investors is the state government’s recent order allowing cinemas to run with 70% occupancy. Chairman of the exhibitors’ section of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA) Ratan Saha told TOI that the collections of ‘Venom: Let There Be Carnage’ and ‘Golondaaj’ have been good. “I want to personally share with our chief minister the roadmap for reviving our exhibition industry. The investment will be ours but credit for the success will go to brand Bengal,” Saha said. He has already invested Rs 20 crore in 17 properties across Bengal, each of which will have two screens. “I am converting Kalna’s Joy Maa Cinema, Bolpur’s Chitra Cinema and Balurghat’s Sandhya Cinema into two screens,” he said. Milan Cinema in Chinsurah was converted into KPS Mall with three screens by Arijit Saha in 2021. “Our family owns three single screens in Bengal. We have started exploring option of phase-wise conversion to malls that have multiple screens,” he said. On Panchami, SVF Cinemas launched its plexes in Dhaniakhali and Durgapur. “We have invested in excess of Rs 4 crore to become the multiplex operators in the malls,” said Rudra Prosad Daw, business head, SVF Cinemas. Rupbani Cinema in Dhaniakhali was revamped by KPS Group where SVF Cinemas is the multiplex operator with one screen. “In Durgapur, the Malkani group reconstructed a single screen titled Anuradha cinemas to build the Raj Sammilonee shopping mall where SVF is operating with three new screens that have 416 seats. On Saptami, three screens with 367 seats were inaugurated at KPS Mall. In the pipeline are two screens in Coochbehar, two in Kalna, one in Baranagar and one in Malda,” Daw added. Shantanu Roychowdhury’s Baruipur showhouse was converted into a two-screen plex in 2018. “Earlier few hall owners including Supen Naskar (Ellora cinema) and Amar Chakraborty (Mahamaya cinema) converted to the two-screen format. In 2021, conversion is the only way for cinemas to survive,” Roychowdhury said. During the pandemic, Chiranjit Saha, who converted his Sangam Kalyani cinema into a two-screen format in 2013, added an extra screen. “Recently, I acquired Chandernagore’s Jyoti cinema and am planning to convert it into two screens,” he said. Sabyasachi Nath, owner of Bashirhat’s Debjani Cinema, is investing approximately Rs 6 crore to make a mall that will have two screens (rented out to Saha). “Instead of 1,051 seats, the screens will have a capacity of 300. We should be able to reopen next Pujas,” Nath said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/plexes-at-revamped-single-screens-a-boost-for-tolly/articleshow/87407857.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The study was carried out by R Jayasankar, a retired HOD, civil engineering department of NIT Trichy. The study focussed on the two pillars near the service road leading to the Tangedco office. The expert said that reinforcement is intact, and steel has not been damaged due to the hour-long fire. While 50mm thickness is required for the reinforcement cover, the pillars were built with a much higher thickness. “The reinforcement cover has lost the cement plasters, so the expert suggested a metal mesh and to apply concrete over the structure,” a corporation official said. The civic body has planned to launch the repair work after Diwali. Corporation said that shops and property owners near the vacant space underneath bridges have been asked not to misuse the space to prevent such fires. “Although we fenced the vacant area, people are using the space to stock their inventories. We will devise a solution,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/nit-expert-advises-metal-mesh-plus-concrete-for-damaged-rob/articleshow/87409548.cms||---

The RJD had fielded Arun Kumar Sah in Tarapur and Ganesh Bharti in Kusheshwar Asthan against the JD(U) nominees Rajiv Kumar Singh and Aman Bhushan Hazari, respectively. Similarly, both the Congress and LJP (Ram Vilas) raised their hands by the evening on the polling day. “The byelection threw up ample signs that our traditional voters (read upper caste, Dalits and Muslims) have started returning to the party,” Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said. LJP (Ram Vilas) general secretary Ashraf Ansari said the mandate will be against the (Nitish Kumar) government. The party’s state president and former MLA Raju Tiwari said the main parties contesting the byelection would come to know about their relative strength after the results on November 2. “Ultimately, it has turned out to be a fight of the people against the state government led by CM Nitish Kumar,” Tejashwi said. According to him, there was “strong anger of the people” at the ground level against the government in the state as well as at the Centre on the issues of price rise, raging unemployment and policy matters. As to the earlier announcement of a mega rally at Patna on the issue of unemployment, he said the date would be fixed after the ‘Chhath’ festival. On former BJP Rajya Sabha member R K Sinha meeting his father Lalu Prasad on Friday night, Tejashwi said, “It was a courtesy call. They had participated in the 1974 stir led by Jayaprakash Narayan. The discussions were held around that.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/opposition-claims-victory-on-both-seats/articleshow/87406472.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Technology gaps slow down cops’ efforts to curb speeding||VISAKHAPATNAM: Though speeding accounts for over 60 per cent of deaths due to road accidents in Andhra Pradesh in 2020, there is no foolproof mechanism in the state to control the problem. A total of 7,039 people were killed and 19,675 persons suffered injuries in 17,924 road accidents in Andhra Pradesh in 2020 as per the latest data of NCRB in its ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India-2020’ report. The NCRB data classified the cause-wise distribution of road accidents. Out of all causes in the state in 2020, ‘overspeeding’ was the reason for 4,778 deaths and 13,774 injuries in 12,344 cases. The data also revealed that dangerous or careless driving/overtaking contributed to 1,221 deaths and 3,630 injuries in 3,300 cases in the state in 2020. The speed limit on national highways and state highways in Andhra Pradesh is 80 to 100 kmph but most motorists exceed the limit, leading to road crashes. While police and Road Transport Authority (RTA) personnel have been monitoring the speed of vehicles using speed laser guns, there is not enough equipment to pinpoint and apprehend violators. The absence of the speed limit display boards on some stretches is another reason for vehicles speeding. A senior police officer with the traffic wing said most of the speed laser guns in the state that can register the speed of a vehicle cannot capture the vehicle’s image at night as they do not have an infrared flash. “The radar guns, however, don’t work at the time when most vehicles are found to be speeding, that is, during the night. Speeding in the night and in the early hours is one of the main reasons for accidents on the roads,” he added. Police and RTA personnel are chalking out plans to procure the latest equipment to mitigate incidents of speeding and speed-related accidents. A total of 7,039 people were killed and 19,675 persons suffered injuries in 17,924 road accidents in Andhra Pradesh in 2020 as per the latest data of NCRB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/technology-gaps-slow-down-cops-efforts-to-curb-speeding/articleshow/87407300.cms||Nalla.Babu

After inspection, Datta said it has been polluted due to several factors. “There has been encroachment over the waterbody and a huge number of cars are being parked on the Sarobar premises. There are various areas on the premises where there has been gross non compliance of the Green Tribunal’s order. I will soon move to the NGT to file a petition over the issue,” Datta told TOI on Saturday. KMDA installed three fountains on the water last week but is now exploring alternative ways of aerating the water following pleas by the local rowing clubs and state rowing association.

Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare on Friday appealed to the citizens and political parties to cooperate with the election mechanism to prepare error-free photo electoral rolls. Mandhare, who is also the District Election Officer (DEO) said that the draft electoral roll has been prepared by the district administration after adding the new names and deleting the duplicate names. The new electoral roll is now available for the citizens to verify and raise claims and doubts with the concerned office if they find their names missing or want changes in the names and addresses, etc. “We have deleted 64,172 names which were either duplicates or names of the deceased voters. On the other hand, we have added 53,133 new names based on the applications. We now have 45.50 lakh voters in the district,” said the DEO. The DEO had received a list of 4.07 lakh names from political parties claiming them to be double entries. The office has so far verified 1.52 lakh applications, out of which photos of 1.23 lakh candidates did not match even though the names and ages were the same. So far, 29,533 double entries have been found and hence, the process of deletion is being carried out. The forms for deletion of 13,965 entries have been collected as part of the process. To deal with the double entries, the collector has asked the political parties to provide the names of Booth Level Agents (BLAs) who have better ideas about the local areas and can coordinate with booth level officers for deleting these names. “There is a process of deleting the voters’ names, for which an application has to be made and the BLAs can facilitate the process. We have to ensure that the name of any voter is not deleted unnecessarily,” Mandhare added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/64172-names-removed-from-voters-list-in-nashik/articleshow/87404981.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||GUVNL raises fuel surcharge by 50 paise||Ahmedabad: State-run Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) has raised Fuel Price and Power Purchase Adjustment (FPPPA) or fuel surcharge by 50 paise per unit for the July-September quarter. The latest surge is one of the highest spikes in fuel surcharge. The fuel surcharge has gone up due to the purchase of costly electricity from a power exchange to meet the surge in demand during the second quarter. Any increase or decrease worked out in the fuel surcharge for a particular quarter is levied from consumers during the following quarter. Although the fuel surcharge for the July-September quarter has been revised to 50 paise per unit, consumers will not have to cough up the entire amount as any increasebeyond 10 paise per unit requires Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC)’s approval. “Since increase in FPPPA for the second quarter of fiscal 2021-22 is 50 paise (increase from Rs 1.90 to Rs 2.40 per unit), which is in excess of 10 paise per unit, approval of the commission has been sought for the recovery of the balance FPPPA of 40 paise/unit,” GUVNL said in its notification. As a result,the apex electricity company has asked its four power distribution companies to levy fuel surcharge at Rs 2 per unit (the fuel surcharge was collected at Rs 1.90 per unit in the previous quarter) from October 1. “GUVNL purchased 5,803 million units of electricity from the Indian Energy Exchange(IEX) at Rs 4.75 per unit during July-September quarter,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy and regulatory expert. Meanwhile,electricity generation at the power plants operated by private companies in the state declined in September following spiralling prices of imported coal and other issues.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guvnl-raises-fuel-surcharge-by-50-paise/articleshow/87407973.cms||---

---||India||Declared citizen 2 years ago, woman faces fresh test||GUWAHATI: A foreigners’ tribunal in Assam’s Bongaigaon district has summoned a 60-year-old woman to prove her citizenship all over again, just over two years after scrutinising her credentials following a police referral and declaring her a bona fide Indian citizen, reports Rokibuz Zaman. Bharati Sarkar, a resident of Jamdoha village, is scheduled to appear before the same tribunal that had previously cleared her. Her previous appearance was on March 8, 2019, based on a summons in a case filed by the border wing of Assam police in 2005. On that occasion, the tribunal ruled that there was no evidence to identify Bharati as an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant of the “post-1971 or any other stream”. This time, Bharati has to defend herself in a second case filed by the police in 2010, branding her a “suspected foreigner”. The police suspect she entered Assam illegally post-March 24, 1971, the cut-off mentioned in the 1985 Assam Accord as the determinant of citizenship for immigrants and their progeny. Bongaigaon SP Swapnaneel Deka confirmed that there were two cases against Bharati and she had been cleared only in one. Bharati’s son, who runs a small shop, said the family did not have the means to fight a second citizenship case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/declared-citizen-2-years-ago-woman-faces-fresh-test/articleshow/87412224.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Candles burn a hole in the pocket with rise in petroleum prices||Kolkata: Lighting up homes with candles will be a more expensive proposition this Kali Puja-Diwali following rise in prices. The astronomical rise in international crude oil rates and the subsequent fuel price rise in India has led to a hike in crude derivatives such as liquid paraffin wax, the principal ingredient in making candles. Price of paraffin wax has increased by 30% in the last three months. As a result, a pack of 10 candles that used to cost Rs 18-Rs 20 is now retailing for Rs 25-Rs 30. The bigger packs of 24 candles that earlier used to cost Rs 50, now costs Rs 65-70. Decorative floral candles which come in boxes of four, six and 10 now range anything between Rs 80-Rs 300. “The price of candles has increased significantly in the last few months, mostly due to the rise in price of petroleum by-products. The whole sellers have increased the prices of candles of different varieties by 25%- 30% this year, forcing us to increase the prices as well,” said Arun Singh, a seller at Old China Bazar market in Burrabazar. Wholesalers said, a kilogram of candles that earlier cost Rs 130 is now being sold at Rs 170. Uday Narayan Singh of Uday Stationary in Burrabazar said the rise in prices have led to a drop in sales. “This is that time of the year when we sell candles in bulk and over the last few years it has fetched traders like us more profit than selling firecrackers. But this year due to the sudden price rise, the sales have been hit,” he said. One of Singh’s loyal customers, Ravi Shrivastava from Jharkhand is also feeling the pinch as he bought two cartons of candles. “I had to settle for only two boxes instead of four because of the high price. Moreover, I will have trouble selling these back home after adding the transportation cost and profit percentage to it,” said Shrivastava. Explaining the reason behind the rise, manufacturers said increase in rates of petroleum by-products like paraffin wax, plastic and LPG has led to the situation. Tuhin Mukherjee of M/S Mukherjee associates at Sovabazar, who has been into the business of manufacturing candles for decades said, “Earlier we used to buy paraffin wax blocks for Rs 90-100 per kg. Now we are buying the same for anything between Rs 130–140. The primary reason being rise in price of petroleum by products. We also need a large quantity of industrial liquid petroleum gas to melt the wax and give it the shape of candles. The rise in LPG too has impacted the price of candles.” Currently, crude oil prices have risen to a near three-year high. Subsequently, retail prices of petrol and diesel, which were already high due to hefty centre and state tax rates, became higher in India. In recent times, whenever crude prices have hit north, the burden has been on the consumers. When crude prices had dropped last year, centre’s excise duty was increased in proportion and consumers continued to pay more. In contrast, the state’s share of taxes has not moved much.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/candles-burn-a-hole-in-the-pocket-with-rise-in-petroleum-prices/articleshow/87407948.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The decision in this regard was taken during a meeting of the merchants and the officers of Thiruvananthapuram fire station to discuss measures to improve safety of the Chalai market, which is highly prone to frequent fire outbreaks. The meeting was organised by Thiruvananthapuram fire station officers Sajith S T and Nithin Raj under the direction of fire department director B Sandhya. According to the officers, the plan is to form groups of community rescue volunteers among merchants and provide them training in first aid fire fighting. Thiruvananthapuram fire station officer Nithin Raj said that the fire department has already divided the Chalai market, which consists of several streets, into seven zones. The plan is to form one group of community rescue volunteers in each zone with each group consisting of at least 20 members. First aid fire fighting involves extinguishing a fire in its initial stages by using whatever means is readily available. The training involves basic awareness of different categories of fire based on its causes and using suitable methods accordingly to douse the flames. During the meeting on Saturday, topics such as measures to be taken to prevent potential fire outbreaks, changes to be brought about in the buildings, scientific parking methods to facilitate smooth movement of fire fighting vehicles and setting up hydrants at strategic locations across the market were also discussed. The merchants who attended the meeting stressed the need to implement the government decision to set up a fire station at Chalai without any further delay.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/chalai-merchants-to-get-training-in-fire-fighting/articleshow/87407934.cms||---

Previous year, Nitish had inaugurated the OPD services of the hospital. Praising the services provided by Medanta in the healthcare sector, Nitish said the association of JP’s name with it in Bihar will also have an impact as they will continue to serve with dedication. He recalled how Jai Prabha Hospital was started in 1979 and JP always dreamt of providing cancer treatment facilities to the people. “In 2005, when we took over, we had brainstorming sessions with the heads of several hospitals. No one was ready to take it over. Then Medanta came forward,” Nitish said, adding, “They are doing a great work as a private hospital and have brought their doctors and healthcare workers over here. I felt both happy and satisfied after seeing all these things.” While interacting with the media, Nitish said 25% of the beds will be reserved for the poor patients and an agreement has also been signed with the hospital to provide treatment to government officials at a nominal rate. Located in Kankarbagh, this 500-bed hospital is spread across 7 acres of land. It has 112 critical care beds and 14 operation theatres. Noted cardiothoracic surgeon and Medanta’s chairman and managing director, Dr Naresh Trehan, said, “At Medanta, we strive to deliver world-class healthcare by establishing institutes of excellence that integrate medical care, teaching and research, while providing affordable medical facilities to patients.” Dr Trehan said their hospitals were equipped with the advanced medical technology and equipment. Chairman of Institute of Neurosciences at Medanta, Dr VP Singh, said they believe in holistic and integrated approach during the treatment of a patient and take help from the experts in various fields while dealing with complicated cases. Dr Rajiva Gupta, chairman of rheumatology division, said JP Medanta was now a part of the Medanta family and experts from every unit will fill the gap, wherever required. Dr KK Handa, chairman of ENT division, added, “We at Medanta have coordination and cohesion with one another.” Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, health minister Mangal Pandey, industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain, MLC Kedar Nath Pandey and former MLC Ranbir Nandan were present during the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-inaugurates-inpatient-services-at-jp-medanta-hosp/articleshow/87407947.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Officials from the selected hospitals in Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur said the trial investigators recently emailed them about reaching the limit of trial volunteers before these sites could get the necessary documentation in place as well as the Ethics Committee approval. An official from Biological E in Hyderabad declined comment on the matter, citing confidentiality. According to the information on Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI), the Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Biological E’s Corbevax vaccine for protection against Covid was to be conducted at 30 sites, including seven in Maharashtra. Only two hospitals in the state — Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital in Mumbai, and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Wardha — could participate in the Phase III trial for adults. This was the first time in Maharashtra that a trial for Corbevax, India’s third indigenous vaccine against Covid-19, was to be conducted for adults. Phase 1 and 2 trials of the vaccine were conducted at sites in other states. Hospitals earlier chosen from Pune were YCM Hospital and BJ Government Medical College, and Sassoon General Hospitals College. In Mumbai, three hospitals were selected: Grant Medical College and JJ Hospital, TN Medical College and BYL Nair Hospital, and Tata Memorial Centre. An official from a hospital selected for the trial in Nagpur said: “Before we could complete the necessary paperwork and get an approval from the Ethics Committee, the sample size was achieved at other sites. We received a communication in October to not take the process forward further.” The official said the enrolment was the first step of a clinical trial. “Different sites enter the study at different time during the trial period. The sample size is simultaneously calculated as and when volunteers are enrolled. There is no fixed site-specific volunteer number. If the sample size is 3,000, it is not necessary that all the sites should enrol an equal number of volunteers. Therefore, once the sample size was achieved in this case, other selected sites were asked not to go ahead with the process,” he said. The principal investigator for the trial in a Mumbai hospital said: “We were in the process of getting the Ethics Committee approval, when we were informed that the volunteer enrolment process had been completed. It was in first week of October. Our site was thus not required to undertake the trial.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-corbevax-ph-3-trial-at-jj-but-5-hospitals-in-state-miss-chance/articleshow/87409665.cms||Neha Madaan

His hands were brought to Mumbai in a chartered flight for the recipient, a 32-year-old father of two from Pune. The transplant is being carried out in Global Hospital in Parel, where the city’s first hand transplant was carried out in August 2020. While the second hand transplant in the city was carried out in BMC-run KEM Hospital, Parel, in August, the third was performed two weeks back in Global. Less than 20 hand transplants have been performed in India, with Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi having started the procedure. A senior doctor said that Mumbai,, after having done four hands transplants within a year, has emerged as a “destination’’ for the procedure. The last three transplants have been done in the last two months. Saturday’s transplant recipient is a former accountant and a quadruple amputee, having lost his hands and legs after being electrocuted on Diwali in 2019. He was watering plants in the evening in the garden when he stood on a live wire. “He needs above-elbow bilateral transplant. The operation began around 5.30pm on Saturday and could take 12 to 16 hours to complete,’’ the doctor said. It is learnt that the donor, who suffered from kidney disease and used to undergo dialysis for a year, suffered an intracranial bleed. His family donated his hands, heart and liver. Meanwhile, the third hand transplant recipient, Jagdev Singh, is recovering well, said doctors from Global Hospital. “He has been undergoing physiotherapy and could be discharged within a week,’’ said a doctor associated with the transplant. Bilateral transplants cost Rs 21-26 lakh, and Singh and the latest recipient needed financial help for the procedure. Incidentally, Mumbai has completed 30 cadaveric transplants in 2021 so far as compared to 30 in 2020 and 79 in 2019. “Of the four hand transplants carried out in Mumbai, only one set of hands were donated in the city while the rest came from other cities,’’ said Dr S Mathur, who heads the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-fourth-hand-transplant-begins-on-32-year-old-pune-father-of-two/articleshow/87409722.cms||---

I want to tell you and the people of Goa that whoever back-stabbed Congress will not get a place in the party,” Gandhi told party workers during a convention at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee indoor stadium, Taleigao. In 2019, 10 Congress MLAs joined BJP. While the party had had a similar experience in the past too, it didn’t hesitate to welcome the likes of Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate back. After agreeing to contest on a Congress ticket in the 2007 assembly polls, Monserrate filed his nomination under the banner of United Goans Democratic Party a few minutes before the deadline for the nomination process. The betrayal left Congress without a candidate. However, he went on to become education minister in the Congress-led government. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was elected on a Congress ticket in 2017, resigned a few months later. He contested and won on a BJP ticket, and was made health minister. Working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco told party workers that both district committees have passed resolutions not to take back those who have left the party. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/no-place-for-traitors-in-party-warns-gandhi/articleshow/87410994.cms||---

An official said many model and private schools in east Delhi had shut down during the Covid pandemic, following which the parents had approached the teachers and principals to arrange for English medium sections so that they could enrol their kids. “After so many requests, we assured the parents that some step will be taken soon. Only after the assurance, many of them got their kids enrolled to the schools, which has also now helped our enrolment rate,” said an EDMC official.

Of the total students, 2.15 lakh are attending classes regularly or their parents are in touch with teachers. Of the 354 schools, 124 have English sections (one or two depending upon strength and requirement), which will now be available in the remaining 230 schools as well. The education department claimed to have received anticipatory approval from the mayor for the project and would implement the direction after issuing official order on Monday. “Now that the anticipatory approval has been received and an order will be issued shortly, we have started asking teachers to prioritise students in English sections whose parents have appealed/applied earlier. However, depending on requirement/demand, area and strength in a school, we can increase the number of sections from one to two in each class,” the official added. As far as the other mediums/language taught at schools is concern, at least three schools are fully English medium and then there are others where Urdu is taught. “Now, students have an option to choose English, Hindi or other mediums depending on his/her choice and capability. A direction will shortly be issued to the teachers to make their preparations accordingly,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/1-english-medium-section-for-all-classes-under-edmc/articleshow/87411643.cms||Vibha Sharma

He was 67. Bali was among the tallest leaders of the Congress in the state. With his death, Congress has lost another senior leader in the hill state. Former CM Virbhadra Singh, who had a bitter-sweet relationship with Bali, passed away on July 8 this year. Rivalry between the duo was well-known.

The teens were runners-up in the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition 2021 — the world’s oldest international school writing competition — for essays reflecting on the pandemic. Aditi S Nair (15) from Delhi was senior runner-up and Raisa Gulati (14) from Amritsar was junior runner up, beating over 25,000 entries from across the Commonwealth. The senior winner was from Kenya and the junior winner was from Uganda. It was Nair’s first trip to London. She travelled there with her father. “Britain is different to India but in a nice way,” the 11th-grade pupil from Sanskriti School in Chanakyapuri told TOI. Aditi Nair“It was nice meeting Camilla, though we didn’t get to talk. But I got to speak to others like the speaker of the House of Commons,” said Nair. “It was a really grand palace and we got to see the chair where the monarch sits I could feel the history of the place.” Nair and Gulati came to Britain for a winners’ week, which included a tour of Parliament, a visit to Westminster Abbey, a writing workshop and a trip to Cambridge University. Raisa GulatiOn her winning essay ‘Prithvi Mata’ (Mother Earth), Nair said: “I used the earth goddess to symbolise the positive impact the pandemic had on nature, so in my story, she looks younger and more radiant. But when Covid-19 cases recede and humans start interacting again, she looks haggard again. Thirty years later, she ends humanity.” Gulati, a year nine pupil at Mayo College Girls’ School in Ajmer, wrote ‘Autobiography of Corona,’ which narrates how vaccines and lockdowns thwart the virus’s attempt to destroy humanity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/2-indian-teens-honoured-by-duchess-for-covid-19-essays/articleshow/87411647.cms||NAOMI CANTON

As per the guidelines issued by state government, the railways can issue only monthly season tickets to passengers who have completed 14 days since taking their second dose of a vaccine. Last week, the state government also ordered the suspension in sale of daily journey tickets to essential category workers. “Everyday we get reports of arguments between booking clerks and passengers who are refused journey tickets. This is causing mental agony to staff which is also affecting personal life of many,” Venu Nair, general secretary, National Railway Mazdoor Union, said. Times ViewThe state government's diktat to not to issue daily journey tickets to even fully vaccinated passengers who have completed 14 days after taking their second dose must now be withdrawn as the state has allowed those with two doses to enter malls and restaurants. The rule is causing distress to genuine passengers who are not regular users of local trains but have to travel for work or during emergencies. The railway ministry should also take a proactive stand and ask the state to relax norms for daily tickets as it is causing stress to railway staff, who have to spend energies in arguing with passengers.The unions said they were not blaming the passengers, who are conscientious and do not want to travel without a ticket for work. “We are going to meet the divisional railway manager of Central Railway on Monday and submit our memorandum, which will highlight concerns of booking clerks. They should permit daily general tickets if passenger has completed 14 days after taking second dose,” Nair said. Many passengers require daily journey tickets as they may have no specific workplace, such as those who may be in the sales or servicing sector. Kurla resident Abdul Hamid said he worked with an air-conditioning repair firm and his assignment could be in Mira Road today and Vashi tomorrow. “I cannot take MST [monthly season ticket] for entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region and hence prefer to take daily ticket,” Hamid said. Urmil Mehta from Ghatkopar said daily tickets were allowed in other public transport systems. “We buy daily tickets on BEST bus and even Metro system. These are also as overcrowded as trains during the peak hour, but restriction for issuing daily ticket is only on suburban train system, which is weird,” Mehta said. Even festive shopping is inconvenient now as people are forced to travel without a ticket in train or take expensive and time-consuming rides by taxi or autorickshaw.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-unions-threaten-stir-to-press-for-daily-tickets/articleshow/87409748.cms||Manthank Mehta

Syndic action is based on the Lokayukta report which states that Pal had failed to give a satisfactory reply to charges of corruption levelled against him. The government’s nod to retire Pal had come last Thursday. The charges of corruption relate to his tenure as vice-chancellor of Gujarat University during 2011 when the GU campus library was said to have been defrauded of Rs 1.7 crore. The Lokayukta took up the case after the education department filed a formal complaint. On October 14, deputy secretary of the education department, Moulik Shah wrote a letter to North Gujarat university to take action which resulted in the syndicate forcibly retiring him from November 1, 2021. He will get the post retirement benefits as per government rules.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/ex-vc-adesh-pal-forced-to-retire/articleshow/87407941.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PGI, CSIO docs make device to automate blood exchange in jaundiced babies||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: Babies born with severe jaundice need exchange of adult blood to prevent permanent brain damage. This exchange is done manually by taking small amounts of blood out and letting the same amount of blood in. This is a very tedious process and a minor error by a doctor can lead to blood clot formation--embolism. For the first time, this process has been automated by a team of PGI doctors and scientists at Central Scietific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) using a machine which senses clot formation and alerts the user. A patent has been filed and the team of scientists and doctors are working on transferring the technology soon. The double volume exchange transfusion is being done manually in severe jaundice--Hyperbilirubinemia--which shoots up to dangerous levels, especially during transportation of the newborn to PGI. One of the aims is to enable smaller hospitals to have this system, which does not require advanced skill as the process is automated. The doctor should know how to place the catheter through the baby's umbilicus. The project is sponsored by the department of science and technology. “Through the umbilicus, a catheter is passed and two times the entire volume of baby’s blood is exchanged with an adult donor’s blood. It cannot be done in one go, as the entire blood of the baby cannot be taken out, so we do it in small volume. For instance, take 5ml out, put 5ml of adult blood in and repeat till the entire blood volume is exchanged,” said Prof Saurabh Dutta, principal investigator of the project at PGI. He added, “This is a very tiring process and highly prone to errors as the exact volume of blood has to be pulled out and pushed in and with the same speed. There are chances of air bubbles or clot formation during the process. So one needs hawk eye vigil.” The main scientists involved from the CSIO include Dr Sanjeev Verma and Arindam Chatterjee. “We have automated the process and used sensors which can detect the clots or bubble formation,” said Chatterjee. There are two pumps in this machine which work in tandem. Each of these pumps handles a syringe separately. There are four one-way valves that guide the blood flow. In the pull phase, the syringe pulls fresh blood from the donor and an equal amount is pulled from the patient--the jaundiced blood. After this, the push phase starts when the fresh donor blood gets diverted into the patient and the jaundiced blood goes into waste. The user sets the volume, timings and the total amount of blood to be exchanged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pgi-csio-docs-make-device-to-automate-blood-exchange-in-jaundiced-babies/articleshow/87406484.cms||Shimona Kanwar

According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast agency SAFAR, over 1,800 farm fires were observed in the northwest region of Delhi on Friday. The Central Pollution Control Board's data showed the capital recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 268. Track the pollution level in your cityAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. SAFAR said the air quality is likely to improve to the moderate category on Sunday due to change in the wind direction from northwesterly to south easterly. The Sub-Committee on Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) had on Thursday directed authorities in Delhi and NCR states to implement measures under the “very poor” category in addition to steps listed under “poor” to “moderate” AQI category under GRAP.

The next hearing is on December 2. A division bench of chief justice Mohammad Rafiq and justice Sabina passed these orders on the writ petition of one Satish Berry, who claims that the Union housing ministry formulated guidelines for integrated housing and slum development in the year 2008-09 and, on February 21, 2009, the state approved it for Parwanoo, where it identified 192 potential beneficiary families. In 2013, 36 of those families got their flats in the first phase. The construction project finished in 2016 and another 23 families moved in during the second phase in 2017. Since 2017, 133 flats remain vacant despite 192 identified families and 98 pending applications from 2014 and 2015. Therules of allotment require the beneficiaries to have a homeless certificate and resident status of the MC area for at least 15 years. The Parwanoo MC’s alleged policy was of pick and choose. The petitioner alleged that renting out the remaining houses could have generated some income for the MC. He has alleged wastage of public money and requested the court to direct the respondents to allot houses to the applicants without further delayand penalise the erring councillors and MC officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/petition-says-pick-and-choose-policy-in-alloting-flats-to-poor-in-hp-hc-notice-to-2-secy-level-officers/articleshow/87409750.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Robotic surgery will work wonders in cancer treatment’||Cancer has been one of the most enigmatic topics in the field of health care. Most of us know cancer as a dreadful disease. But there’s a lot more that we should know about it, especially about the advancements in treatment, including the latest, ‘robotic surgery’, and its next step, ‘Artificial intelligence. In an interview with TOI, Dr Abhinav Yashwant Deshpande, a well-known surgeon, who has specialized in surgical oncology and robotic surgery, shares his experience and knowledge about cancer treatment as October is observed all over the world as the ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’. Excerpts... Q. What’s the current cancer scenario in India? A: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the entire world. According to WHO, one in six deaths globally is because of cancer. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, in India, one woman dies of cervical cancer every 8 minutes. For every two females diagnosed with breast cancer, one woman dies in India. Due to tobacco, more than 3,500 people are affected in India every day. By 2025, there will be more than 15 lakh cancer cases, which means 1 out of 10 Indians will suffer from the disease and 1 out of 15 will lose the battle. But the positive part is that if we are aware and receive treatment early, cancer can be treated. Q. October is known as the ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’. Why is the disease on the rise? A. There are many factors that lead to certain types of cancers. These factors can be divided into three types — vulnerable factors, contributing factors and direct factors. Taking the example of breast cancer, the vulnerable factors can be early menses or late menopause while contributing factors can be lack of exercise, excess alcoholism, injection of pesticide or chemicals. The direct factors are radiation and inherent mutations (If the genes are present, they can be considered as direct factors). These are the various factors that increase the chances of breast cancer in women. Q. Are there any tests to determine whether a person is at risk of a particular cancer? A. Knowing the basic cause of cancer or knowing how to identify the basic symptoms can save lives. For example, if your immediate relatives have cancer or many people from one side of the family have some type of cancer, consult a doctor for genetic counselling. Self-examination in case of breast cancer or even pap-smear test for cervical cancer should be encouraged after a certain age. Robotic surgery, personalized oncology, immune therapy, liquid biopsy and many more advancements in cancer treatment are boosting the self-esteem of patients. Q. What is robotic surgery all about? A. There are three important treatments for cancer. Medical oncology is treating cancer through medical processes like chemotherapy. Radiation oncology involves radiation therapy to target cancer tumours. Finally, surgical oncology deals with the surgical aspects like ‘How do you remove cancer from the body through operations?’ This process takes care of the parts affected by cancer as well as the potential organs where the disease might spread. It needs better vision, greater precision, improved dexterity, and tremor filtration. Robotic surgery has all these plus points. Q. If the robot performs the surgery, then what does the surgeon do? A. A lot of scepticism as well as apprehension loomed over this very concept of the introduction of an alien hand for dealing with human life. But we must understand that robotic surgery is performed on the concept of master-slave. The robot follows the directions of the surgeon. Ultimately, human intelligence is using the special abilities of the machine but with full control over it. The robot can show the 3D view/high definition image with depth perception to the surgeon. It gives a 360-degree view, ensures intuitive movements, the robotic hand can move 7 degrees more than a human hand. A robotic surgery has many such advantages. Q. What are the advantages of robotic surgery? A. Less blood loss during the procedure, decreased hospital stay, less painful surgery, smaller scars, better cosmesis, better dissection and retrieval for cancer patients and shorter post-operative recovery are some big benefits. The patient may resume work early. These are some patient-specific benefits. Q. How does the cost factor work in robotic surgery and is it covered under health insurance? A. The cost issue is important. Robotic technology can lead to increase in cost because doctors have to pay not only for the one-time cost of robots but also for the maintenance of technology. But the cost will reduce in the coming days as the technology will get more acceptance. We have very few trained robotic surgeons in Central India. Very few hospitals have robots. It’s a thing of the future and we must accept it. Q. What is the future of robotic surgery? A. Robotic surgery is evolving. It is here to stay. The time has come to welcome this new technology with open arms and open minds. The present incorporated technologies have definitely channelized the zeal and enthusiasm towards lesser interventions with maximum benefits. Another exciting branch, which is the extension of the current advancements is artificial intelligence. The coming years would solve the enigma surrounding AI. A lot of excitement and optimism surrounding robotics would eventually unfold in the future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/robotic-surgery-will-work-wonders-in-cancer-treatment/articleshow/87408036.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Investigators claimed that funds were embezzled from the hospital over the purchase of linen. Police said that one 59-year-old Sneh Rani Gupta, a proprietor of Sneh Enterprises, was arrested from Rohini in the case. The private firm had been a supplier for AIIMS for many years. Dr Anoop Daga, medical superintendent of Rajender Prasad eye centre at AIIMS, informed police about the embezzlement of funds. “No actual items were supplied for the forged supply orders. However, payment for them was released to Sneh Enterprises,” additional commissioner of police (EOW) RK Singh said. The firm’s account statement confirmed the receipt of payments. “A team led by DCP (EOW) Rajeev Ranjan discovered that the goods paid for were never delivered to the AIIMS, Delhi,” Singh added. The GPS logs of the vehicles mentioned on the e-way bills were also scrutinised, revealing that they were not in Delhi on the mentioned dates. Police said the forged supply orders were supplied in connivance with an AIIMS staff member. “The accused firm submitted only invoices and delivery challans. The receipt of goods was not found in the other registers of the general store either,” the officer said. Police said the bills were raised by the hospital’s staff members concerned and were approved without the knowledge of the authorised or competent officials. After getting these bills of sham deliveries sanctioned, the cheated amount was transferred to the firm’s account.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/owner-of-pvt-firm-caught-for-rs-13-8cr-fraud-at-aiims/articleshow/87409776.cms||---

It was inaugurated by mayor Raja Iqbal Singh. “The dog park is unique in many ways and comprises swings, green patches for canines and their pet parents so that they can enjoy a good walk and some good rides together. With the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the life of pet dogs and pet parents got confined to indoors and within limited space, which made many of them fall prey to lifestyle diseases. The facility will help the pets stay fit and have recreation in safe and open spaces like parks,” said the mayor. The north corporation’s assistant deputy commissioner (Karol Bagh zone), Vishakha Yadav, said that a seamless registration counter has been installed to ensure adequate safety measures for the pets and the pet parents. “Beautifully depicted dog caricatures and paintings are drawn across the park, giving it a lively atmosphere. Different kinds of swings, including the ones made out of waste, form the highlight of the park, which will enthral the pet lovers and their babies,” she said. “The park’s ambience was developed under the guidance of Yogesh Saini from Delhi Street Art and the technical expertise was provided by Dr Astha of the veterinary department of the north corporation,” said an official. On the occasion, free technical checkup & anti-rabies vaccination camp for pets were also organised.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/furry-visitors-can-have-fun-get-pampered-at-this-park/articleshow/87411671.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Churchill Alemao discharged in alleged Rs 300 crore corruption case||PANAJI: A special court on Saturday discharged former PWD minister Churchill Alemao and a PWD executive engineer in an alleged Rs 300 crore case, in which the crime branch accused them of fraudulently floating tender notices pertaining to 258 road/maintenance works before 2011. The prosecution alleged that executive engineer Parkar, in his official capacity, and Alemao, the then minister, hatched a criminal conspiracy with “oblique motive by abusing their positions as public servants”, so that preferred contractors were favoured to execute the public works. The crime branch filed the chargesheet against Alemao and Parkar under Sections 120-B, 403, 409 and 420 IPC and Section 13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. However, the court said that the FIR didn’t disclose any facts that constituted an element of any of the alleged offences. “Even the documentary evidence produced by the prosecution is lacking to that effect,” it said. “Further, the investigating officer has not shown any record of conducting any preliminary investigation before registering the FIR to see whether prima facie, the information can reliably make out the commission of a crime. The prosecution has thus failed to produce any legal evidence to show that the acts of the accused fall within the ingredients for the offences that he has been sought to be charged with.” Public prosecutor S Samant submitted that Alemao, with malafide intention, ensured that the files pertaining to non-plan works are received by him so that (they) can be approved and a particular contractor is favoured by awarding the contract. Samant said that Parkar flouted prescribed procedures and “created a lot of illegalities”. The prosecution also alleged that the duo floated 13 short tender notices pertaining to 258 works as maintenance works. “There was no competition between prospective tenderers, which resulted in non-sale of tender forms, thereby causing loss to the exchequer and undue favour and pecuniary gain to the predetermined contractors,” police alleged. But judge Vincent D’Silva said that there is no evidence to show any kind of demand by the accused. “There is also no evidence to show any sort of abuse of office by the accused,” he said. “There is also no evidence to show that the accused has gotten any advantage due to the awarding of the works contacts. There has been no prima facie evidence to show that such actions were done only to gain pecuniary interest for the accused themselves or any other party without any public benefit.” Alemao’s lawyer, Carlos Alvares Ferreira, submitted that procedural lacunae or a breach of procedure does not mean fraud or criminality. The mere fact that rules or norms applicable were violated or the decision taken may have been improper or contrary to department means cannot be dishonest intention to obtain a pecuniary advantage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/alemao-discharged-in-alleged-rs-300cr-corruption-case/articleshow/87411017.cms||---

It has deployed CNG-based hydraulic pruning machines to prune branches of tall trees that are difficult to access. The machines have been bought through urban development funds and cost Rs 27 lakh. In addition to this, the civic agency has attached shredders to the vehicles carrying the hydraulic tree pruning machines so that branches can be collected and disposed of easily. “We have two shredders and two hydraulic machines that are compact in size and can be together transported in a mini truck to even internal colony roads for pruning of trees. Doing this exercise through regular equipment was a tough task. As soon as branches are pruned, we will shred them then itself to allow the transportation in one go. This will save time, cost as well as inconvenience faced by the people when the pruned items are not removed for a long time,” said an EDMC official. In the next step, EDMC is also expecting a supply of 100 hedge trimmers and 100 lawn mowers from the urban development funds by December end. “We can utilise them at parks and roadside green spaces. We have two zones and based on the requirement, the equipment will be shared by the horticulture department,” added the official. Recently, the civic body had relaunched the scheme for giving the parks’ maintenance to RWAs at a certain cost on Public Private Partnership basis. Officials claimed that the move aimed to improve the beauty of parks, which can be better maintained by the locals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/green-tools-to-prune-tall-trees-in-areas-under-edmc/articleshow/87409858.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||IVF brings high milk yield Gir genes from Brazil to India via local Gaolao cows||Bullish on test-tube cattle, a Vidarbha farm proprietor is getting pure Gir cows delivered from little-known breeds. The aim is to enhance yield from the usual 8 litres to at least 20 litres per cowNagpur: A frail white cow stands suckling a chestnut calf almost as tall as her at a dairy farm in Dhanori, some 50km from Nagpur towards Amravati. Farm proprietor Sudhir Diwe is breeding high milk yielding Gir cows from the wombs of poorer cousins, the Gaolao. The Gir breed has become a brand name due to the attention on indigenous cattle these days, but the Gaolao has not gained much fame. Pure Gir calves at this farm have been delivered from Gaolao cows, found in Nagpur and Wardha. There are 18 calves sired by a famous Brazilian bull Soberano, and mothered by equally famous cow Gauri, but delivered by little-known cattle breeds. Diwe, former official on special duty to Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, started the dairy business recently. Not the first, but among the first few tech-savvy dairy farmers, Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University (Mafsu) executive council member Diwe is bullish on test tube cattle. Apart from the 18 one-year-old cattle born in November last year, another 10 are on the way. The effort was also mentioned by Gadkari in a recent event. This may be the first herd of test tube cattle of Vidarbha, and also perhaps among the highest numbers bred in a single place. Now, Mafsu has also acquired the technology, and initial operations at concessional rates are expected to start soon. Diwe got the idea during the yearly Agrovision farm expo organized by Gadkari. A stall was set up by JK Trust, Pune, which is part of the Raymond group, which makes the test tube calves. It’s hoped that the test tube cows will yield at least 20 to 25 litre of milk as compared to over 8 litres from the conventional Gir cattle. “These are IVF cattle, and it happens the same way as it is done in humans. Soberano is a bull born of a mother who yielded as much as 65 litres of milk. Its semen was imported by JK Trust. The eggs are harvested from Gauri, a cow that yields over 20 litres, and is among the best. On an average the offspring may yield 40 litres but even 25 litres would be enough for a local farmer,” says Diwe. The frozen semen of a high grade bull like Soberano is used to fertilize egg of cows like Gauri. The embryo formed in an incubator is planted into the womb of a recipient cow. “The delivering cow can be of any breed, it has to be just good enough to yield couple of litres for the calf. Of course, certain screening is done before zeroing on the recipient. Out of the 18 calves, 5 to 6 were born from Gaolao breed,” said Diwe. The whole process was taken up by JK Trust and costs Rs30,000 a cow. “It’s indeed too expensive for ordinary farmers. To increase the yield of indigenous cattle the government must subsidise the process,” he says. “The technology was available a little earlier abroad. In India, we are working on it since 2016. Gauri is a star performer and so far we may have produced 500 test tube calves,” says Dr Shyam Zanwar, CEO of JK Trust, who is set to take over as national mentor to Rashtirya Gokul Mission. “We started with embryo transplantation of sheep in 1975 for improving the wool production. It was not IVF but in vivi fertilization. It’s slightly different process. Here, the embryo is produced within the donor cow and then transplanted into the recipient. In IVF, embryos are created outside and then transplanted. After the sheep project ended, in vivo fertilization of cattle continued till 2000,” he said. Zanwar hopes to create test tube offspring of other species too.

The state added 1,129 deaths this month compared to 1,754 deaths last month. It added 1,130 cases and 26 deaths on Saturday, taking the total caseload to 66.09 lakh and the toll to 1,40,196 since the outbreak of the infection in March last year. The city registered 301 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths. The drop in the weekly growth rate of the novel coronavirus infection to 0.04% was the first time it dipped so low after August. The weekly growth rate had climbed to 0.06% after a slight surge in the number of Covid-19 cases after restrictions on train services were eased. “October has been one of the better months in the Covid pandemic so far,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “The case fatality rate was under 1 for most of this month.” The only other months in which the case fatality rate was lower were February and March at 0.7% and 0.36%, respectively. Although more deaths were recorded in the week ending on Saturday than the week before, Kakani said that fluctuations in daily rates could happen. Even at the state level, October has been a rather good month, with the state reporting the lowest number of Covid-19 cases this year. The state added 58,750 cases of Covid-19 this month compared to the 1.06 lakh cases that it added in September. “There are at least 20 districts in the state that have less than 100 active cases and are adding new cases in single digits. The situation is much better today, all eyes are now on the post-festive numbers,” said an official. Infectious disease specialist Dr Om Shrivastava, who is a member of the state government task force on Covid-19, said although the situation seemed under control at the moment, people need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-deaths-due-to-covid-in-state-dip-to-1129-in-oct/articleshow/87409794.cms||---

---||India||In message of solidarity, Vatican flags threats of hyper-nationalism||VATICAN CITY: Ahead of Diwali, The Vatican has greeted the Hindu community, expressing hope that interreligious solidarity can bring light in people’s lives amid despair and uncertainty arising from the challenges posed by the pandemic. The Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue sent “its most cordial greetings” on Friday to all Hindus on the occasion of Diwali on the theme “Christians and Hindus: Together bringing light into people’s lives in times of despair”. The Pontifical Council said that greater awareness about one another, interdependence and working solidarity can help the world emerge out of every crisis better. “Even the pressing global issues that threaten to disrupt the harmony between nature and people and the harmonious co-existence of people such as climate change, religious fundamentalism, terrorism, hyper-nationalism, xenophobia can be effectively addressed since these are concerns that affect us all,” it said. The statement comes as PM Modi on Saturday called on Pope Francis at the Vatican and had a very warm meeting and discussed with him a wide range of issues and also invited the Pontiff to visit India. “May the observance of this feast even in the midst of anxiety and uncertainty arising from the present pandemic, and its resultant worldwide crises, light up your lives, homes and communities with the hope for a better future,” it said in the statement. The scars of the first and second waves of the pandemic, which upended the lives and livelihood of people, has left the people with a sense of resignation, despair and despondency and “we both Christians and Hindus can bring the light of hope in people’s lives in such challenging times,” it said. “Bringing light together in people’s lives through interreligious solidarity also validates the usefulness and resourcefulness of religious traditions in society,” it said. Noting that religious traditions, as repositories of wisdom, in times of crisis have the power of lifting sagging spirits, the Pontifical Council said that they also have the capacity to help individuals and communities to reset their life’s compass with hope, with their gaze fixed beyond their present despair. It called on the religious and community leaders to nurture the spirit of fraternity among their followers with a view to helping them walk and work together with the people of other religio-us traditions, most especially during crisis and calam-ity of every kind. “The power of solidarity unleashed in alleviating the suffering and assisting the needy, more so with an interreligious character and responsibility, gives visibility to the light of hope by putting in evidence the response which adherents of all religious traditions are called upon to make in times of despair and darkness,” the statement said. According to Johns Hopkins University data, there are more than 246,082,500 Covid-19 cases globally with over 4,990,300 deaths.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-message-of-solidarity-vatican-flags-threats-of-hyper-nationalism/articleshow/87411577.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Rising Ganga threatens Nov-end deadline for completion of KV Dham project||Varanasi: The rising level of the Ganga, which usually remains constant from September onward, has left the officials associated with the Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project worried as it will disturb the November-end deadline set for the completion of the project. Talking to TOI on Saturday, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “Over 80% work of over Rs 700 crores KV Dham project has been completed. Most of the buildings proposed in the corridor area are at verge of completion with the finishing and interior work going on in full swing. But, the rise in the water level of the Ganga has hampered the work.” The rise in Ganga level has not allowed the company executing the project to restart the work on the riverfront side, which will give access to Kashi Vishwanath temple direct from several ghats, including Manikarnuka, Jalasen and Lalita ghats, due to which threat of delay in completion of work at this point has increased. The Ganga adopted a rising trend in July when it crossed the danger mark, and again in September. In recent decades, no trend of rise in water level of the Ganga in the later part of October had been witnessed, said officials. However, the water level adopted a rising trend again since October 22 following heavy downpour in hills of Uttarakhand. As per Saturday’s daily flood bulletin of Central Water Commission (Middle Ganga division), water level of the Ganga reached 64.86 meter-mark and the rising trend was continuing. Officials said as the water level has become stable upstream at Phaphamau, Prayagraj and Mirzapur, possibility of further rise has reduced. However, the river Ganga has left the ghats inundated by ending their interconnectivity while venue of Ganga Aarti has also been shifted upstairs. The work of KV Dham project, which gained momentum with the formation of Yogi Adityanath government in December 2017 after which Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid its foundation on March 9, 2018, was continuing at an accelerated pace till two waves of Covid-19 hampered it twice. Thus, the deadline of the project, which was initially fixed as August 2020, was revised with the new target being November-end. Officials said that construction of jetty and its retaining wall at Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghat were completed before the monsoon became active this year in June. But, the fresh hurdle created by increased water level of the Ganga has hampered the work of construction of ramps at Manikarnika gate from Jalasen entrance point, Ganga view gallery, cafeteria and public utilities, which were added later with this project. Before the state government gave approval to this additional work of Rs 55 crores in its recent cabinet meeting, the tender process for works had already been completed, said officials. But, all eyes are now on the water level of the Ganga as restarting work at this point will be possible only when the water level will recede.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/rising-ganga-threatens-nov-end-deadline-for-completion-of-kv-dham-project/articleshow/87409797.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Jaipur||55L doses available, only 10.9L get jabbed in a week||Jaipur: Even though the state has achieved the milestone of fully vaccinating 2 crore people against Covid, the inoculation pace has taken a hit with 10.9 lakh beneficiaries getting jabbed in the past seven days till Saturday afternoon despite the availability of 55 lakh shots. Out of the 10.9 lakh shots, 8.3 lakh were second doses and 2.6 lakh first. At least 85 lakh people, who have received the first dose, are yet to get the second shot despite being eligible for it. Footfall at the vaccination centres has reduced, which is worrying the health officials. On Saturday, around 1.8 lakh doses were administered at 6,235 sites. “We are sending texts messages to those who have become eligible for the second dose,” said a health department official, adding the enthusiasm in people has reduced. They are also urging people to get vaccinated at the Prashasan Gaon Ke Sang and Prashasan Shehron Ke Sang camps. Sources said low turnout has affected the pace and not the vaccine stocks. Officials are attributing the low turnout to crop-cutting and festive seasons. Till Saturday, 66 lakh doses were administered compared to 1.2 crore shots in August and 1.14 crore in September. There are 5.14 crore eligible (18+ age-group) beneficiaries in the state and 4.25 crore have already received the first dose. Out of 10.28 crore doses the state needs to fully vaccinate its eligible population, it has so far managed only 6.25 crore doses since the drive began in January. Health minister Raghu Sharma has urged the people to get their jabs on time. “More than two crore people received the second dose, but the figure is not sufficient. According to the World Health Organisation, we develop sufficient immunity only after receiving two doses of the vaccine,” the health minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/55l-doses-available-only-10-9l-get-jabbed-in-a-week/articleshow/87409825.cms||---
---||Thane||Bhiwandi struggles to boost Covid vaccination numbers due to illiteracy||BHIWANDI: The powerloom city of Bhiwandi holds the dubious distinction of having the lowest Covid vaccine coverage among municipal corporations in Mumbai metropolitan region. If Mumbai has managed 98.7% first dose coverage so far, numbers in Bhiwandi are less than half (47%). Around 60% of Mumbai’s 92.3 lakh adult population has taken both vaccines, while the corresponding number in this township with a 5.83 lakh population is 16%. “Be it pulse polio or a measles special drive in 2019, Bhiwandi has always been a laggard in vaccination. Covid-19 seems to be no exception,’’ said Bhiwandi Nizampura City Municipal Corporation (BNMC) commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh, who took charge in July. He met powerloom owners few days back and gave an ultimatum that their units won’t be allowed to operate unless their workers are vaccinated. The corporation has held vaccination drives at four masjids to enthuse Muslims, who are 70% of Bhiwandi’s population, to get vaccinated. WHY THE HESITANCY?Resident Sameer Shaikh said he and his family decided to wait for two years before taking the vaccine. “We heard people who take the vaccine will die in two years. If nothing like this happens, we will defiantly take the vaccine,’’ said Shaikh. A maulana said, “People trust social media more than us. When we appeal on loudspeakers for people to go to vaccination centres, many ask me if I can guarantee that vaccination will have no side-effects.’’ Social activist Asad Shaikh, who is helping Nizampura civic corporation by organising meetings with community leaders, blames illiteracy levels for hesitancy. Bhiwandi, a hub of textile production, draws workers from UP, Bihar Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and West Bengal. Most are less educated, and believe information on social media. “Moreover, 98% civic staff are non-Muslims who seem to be unable to convey the message to the masses,’’ said Shaikh. POOR VACCINE SUPPLYOne reason contributing to poor vaccination rate is low stocks. BNMC used to get 5,000 doses as against 50,000 to one lakh that BMC used to get. “After we spoke to additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas earlier this month about poor stocks, we started started getting more,’’ said a civic official. Unlike Mumbai, where corporate houses and NGOs joined hands with hospitals for mega vaccination drives at slums, Bhiwandi corporation has not found CSR partners. “Most of the vaccination carried out in our city has been done by 125 healthcare workers in the corporation,’’ said immunisation officer Dr Varsha Barod. While three private players enrolled for the drive few months back, the response has been poor mainly because of cost. Private centres have managed 10,000 doses, as against the corporation’s 3.6 lakh doses. SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT, BUT...BNMC has taken a leaf out of the polio campaign to send community health workers house-to-house. “Our team checks 150 houses daily. It will take us few weeks to complete the city,’’ said Dr Barod. Vaccination rates improved when Mission Kawach Kundal to promote vaccination across the state: From 37% coverage of the first vaccine on October 8, the number improved to 47%. Dr Barod said meetings were held with Muslim community leaders, maulvis and prominent citizens to spread the message. “When maulvis take the vaccine or give information on benefits of the vaccine, we believe there is a change,” she said. In one month, Baitu Salam Masjid, Deeniyat Masjid and Hindustani Masjid have come forward to start vaccination drives. “Around 10,000 shots have been given at masjids so far,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/bhiwandi-struggles-to-boost-vax-numbers-due-to-illiteracy/articleshow/87409822.cms||Malathy Iyer

The flexible portion of the runway is approximately 2 km long and 50 metre wide. Its re-layering was the most crucial part and the crux of the project. The resurfacing of this part of any runway takes anything between 28 and 35 days. But in the case of Pune, it has been completed in just 14 days,” an airport source told TOI on Friday. “Resurfacing the flexible or black top portion involves putting in four beds of layers on top of each other and it has been the most challenging of the tasks,” the source said. Almost every runway has two sections — the concrete part on either side of the strip and the blacktop or flexible portion between them. The resurfacing of the concrete portions had been on since late 2020. The total length of the lone runway of the airport is 2,530 metre. An airport official confirmed that the facility would be handed over to them by the Indian Air Force (IAF) for commercial flight operations from 8am on Saturday. “The NOTAM (notice to airmen) of the IAF stated that the airport will remain closed for night operations, between 8pm and 8am, until November 30. During this period, the fitment of the centreline lights of the runway will be carried out. Twenty-four-hour operations are expected from December 1. The IAF will take a final call on this,” an official said. Late on Friday evening, the airport authorities said 112 flights (56 departure and 56 arrivals) would operate on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/resurfacing-of-runways-flexibleportion-done-in-record-14-days/articleshow/87376330.cms||Joy Sengupta

On September 12, four people, including a native of Bihar and a medico from KGMU Lucknow, were arrested for using unfair means to help candidates appearing for NEET. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “During the ongoing investigation, we detected that 25 aspirants were in touch with this gang. Of them, 16 appeared in NEET at different centres, while nine skipped... NTA director’s cooperation was sought in investigation and a report was sent to put the results of 16 candidate on hold till the investigation concludes.” Heena Biswas of Tripura, for whom an impersonator Juli Kumari appeared in NEET exam here on September 12, is also among 16 aspirants, the CP said. Juli was arrested by police along with her mother Babita. The CP said: “It has come to light that 25 aspirants from different districts of three states avoided filling forms for NEET from their own stations, while their fee was deposited through the bank account of one person. The investigators contacted NTA authorities to seek the attendance sheets. It was found that nine out of 25 skipped the exam. To ascertain whether actual aspirant appeared in NEET matching their fingerprints became a must. The report was sent to the director NTA.” Investigators are also focusing on collection of sufficient evidence to foil the bid of getting anticipatory bail by the absconding accused, he said. On September 12, crime branch sleuths had raided a NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under the limits of Sarnath police station in afternoon session and caught Juli and her mother of Patna. Vikas, who accompanied Babita and Juli, managed to escape. An FIR was lodged under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document)and 34 (criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention) of IPC against them with Sarnath police. On September 14, the cops succeeded in nabbing KGMU medico Dr Osama Shahid and Abhay Kumar Mehta of this gang. Later, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad in Bihar were also arrested but gang kingpin Neelesh Kumar alias PK alias Prem Kumar of Patna managed to escape when a team of Varanasi police raided his place on September 19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-nta-likely-to-withhold-results-of-16-candidates/articleshow/87409838.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The man had been attacked following an old enmity, senior police officers said. The deceased has been identified as Mahesh, who was lodged in the jail since 2014, and was earlier involved in many criminal cases, including that of murder and extortion. One of the two accused is Raghunath alias Vicky, a member of Rohit Chaudhary gang. An officer from the jail said that Mahesh had an old rivalry with the two men inside the prison. “Circumstances that led to the attack and murder are a matter of probe. On Friday morning, gangster Vicky and another prisoner identified as Imran alias Golu used an improvised weapon and stabbed Mahesh inside the ward. Mahesh sustained stab wounds on his head. He was rushed to the jail hospital from where he was referred to GTB Hospital in east Delhi. He had been under treatment there, but finally succumbed to the wounds on Saturday,” the officer said. The prison department then informed Delhi Police after which a case of murder was registered. A crime and forensics team was also called to the spot for a detailed inspection. A probe has revealed that Raghunath is a close associate of gangster Ankit Gujjar, who was allegedly beaten to death inside Tihar Jail earlier this year. “Raghunath was arrested by Delhi Police on March 7, 2020,” a senior police officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/inmate-stabbed-in-mandoli-jail-dies/articleshow/87411688.cms||---

During a press conference, Dhote labelled the action as a “farcical drama”. The NCP leader said tunnels and such chambers generally have entry and exit points, which was not the case at Ganga Jamuna. “A portion of the building being sealed for convenience was portrayed as concealed chambers and tunnels, which were drilled out from the wall by police. All this drama was to divert the attention of the high court and media,” said Dhote, who has been fighting for the rights of sex workers at Ganga Jamuna since CP Kumar prohibited sex work at the red-light area on August 11. Dhote also said that the CP had no power to declare certain buildings as ‘public places’ to prohibit sex work. “Without the Nagpur Municipal Corporation or state legislature's involvement, it's questionable how police unilaterally declared them as public places,” she said. Dhote added that she was gearing up to take on police department before the high court on the issues of the breach of fundamental and human rights.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/secret-chambers-at-ganga-jamuna-a-farce-dhote/articleshow/87408165.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Swimmers embrace the sea to tide over pool & pandemic blues||MUMBAI: One of the few things that the coronavirus could not shut down was the sea, and for swimmers — who haven’t entered a pool since the first lockdown in March last year and the government still stubborn about not reopening them except for competitive athletes — plunges in the deep sea have created a new appreciation of Mumbai’s coastal waters, empowering swimmers physically, mentally and with social connectedness. For a sport that was among the worst hit by the pandemic, devoted swimmers found a clever work-around to go freestyling and breast stroking in the sea at dawn or on moonlit nights in Juhu, Khar Danda or Gateway with help from local fishermen and coconut vendors. This hardy network of triathletes, endurance trainers, coaches and hobbyists who call themselves ‘Mumbai Sea Swimmers’ (MSS) have been championing the sport of open water swimming and is now have grown into a 500-member community. “After Covid hit and nobody had swum for six months with no possibility of entering a swimming pool anytime soon, it gave us an opportunity to start swimming sessions in the sea. In October 2020, we set up a website to reach a wider audience and the response was overwhelming,” said Mehul Ved, an IT engineer from Mulund who co-founded MSS with Minesh Babla, a businessman from Khar. “We had swum in Goa and Alibaug’s sea waters but never in Mumbai, a city with abundant beaches. Minesh suggested we take help of the local fishermen he knew in Khar Danda for our first sea swim in 2016.” Starting out in Khar Danda, the group now go charting the waters at Juhu. “We’ve swum Sunk Rock to Gateway and are looking forward to new routes like the Mayor’s Bungalow to Gateway and Dharamtar Port to Gateway next,” says Ved, describing a “buddy system” that they’ve introduced to encourage seasoned open water swimmers to help the less experienced ones. “It created camaraderie in the true sense of a community.” Poonam Singh, 56 — who felt the call of the sea two years ago when she decided to participate in an open water race in Goa — could not agree more. “I stopped swimming after I had children. It was in early 2020 that I had this urge to go for a swimathon in Goa and joined MSS for some experience in sea swimming,” she recounts. Until Covid turned the tide. “The event got cancelled but I embraced the sea,” says Singh dwelling on the sense of companionship that sea swimming has brought. “Our shared interest and love for the sea makes us like family, watching over each other in infinite waters. I can’t see myself going back to a pool even after they reopen,” gushes Singh. Swimmers like 24-year-old Shrinath Pandhare from Borivli, who, despite a jellyfish sting and occasional greasy hair from marine oil spills loves the thrill of a water world refreshingly different from the chlorinated and less exhilarating experience of looping up and down in a swimming pool lane. “Sea swimming has made me more athletic, improved my strokes and helped burn calories. And unlike the still water of the pool, the sea’s unpredictability triggers a rush I love,” he says. Is it dangerous? It can be but tiding over fears of swimming in an unending space is usually in one’s own control, claim veterans. “Fear is okay, you’ll overcome it. It is panic in the water that one needs to control,” is the most vital piece of advice Babla can give. “In the sea, there’s no path to follow or walls to touch,” he warns, adding that skills like “sighting, bilateral breathing and treading” could ensure a safe swim. But there are other cautions to exercise, too. “Always swim with someone. Respect local sentiments and seek their permission. If there are lifeguards, inform them of the area and distance you plan to swim,” adds Ved. Apart from monitoring the season, weather, tides and terrain, bright caps and tow floats keep them safe and visible in sea but competing with nature is a strict no. “If the weather doesn’t call for it, don’t force yourself into the water. Also, respect sea creatures. We’re entering their home,” says Ved. What gives them courage are the local fishermen and coconut vendors who act as “eyes and ears” for the community. If the fisherfolk carry swimmers into the sea, row alongside them in case of emergency, and guide them to litter-free zones; the coconut sellers on the beach help guard their belongings and sound alerts for days not suitable for swimming. “Their knowledge and resourcefulness make it possible for us to venture safely into the sea,” says Babla, assuring that encounters of the hazardous kind are rare except for trysts with local dolphins. “Which we don’t consider perilous. In fact, we wonder if they’ve come to say hello!”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/swimmers-embrace-the-sea-to-tide-over-pool-pandemic-blues/articleshow/87409873.cms||Mohua Das
---||Bareilly||UP: Ex-MLA gets life in prison for rape of college girl in 2008||BAREILLY: A special MP/MLA court in Budaun has sentenced former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Yogendra Sagar to life in prison for the alleged rape of a college student 13 years ago. He has also been fined Rs 30,000, which will be given to the survivor as compensation. The woman, who was 20 when the crime was committed, was abducted and gang-raped in 2008, and Sagar was made a co-accused in the case. Though the police had filed a closure report in Sagar's favour, the case was reopened by a sessions court in 2010. It was then transferred to the MP/MLA court for speedy trial under supervision of the Supreme Court. The judgment on Saturday was pronounced by additional district judge Akhilesh Kumar after he found Sagar guilty under IPC sections 376 D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Sagar’s son is a sitting BJP MLA from Bisauli constituency in Budaun. "My daughter is now married. She finally got justice after so many years," the victim's father told TOI. Additional district government counsel A K Singh said, “The accused was an MLA from Bilsi constituency in 2008. Police had filed a closure report but the court found that the initial statement of the survivor was recorded while she was under the influence of the accused, who had been threatening her. "The judge considered the revised statement of the girl, which she had submitted later in court, and convicted the MLA for rape and criminal intimidation," A K Singh added. The woman's counsel Arvind Sharma said, “She was out to collect notes from her friend’s house when she was kidnapped by BSP workers Tejendra Sagar and Neeraj Sharma (both convicted in 2019) on April 23, 2008. She was found by police near the Muzaffarnagar city railway station after a month and was unwell but the police didn’t take her to the district hospital for medical examination and just recorded her statement." He said that only after she was handed over to the family did she tell them about her abduction, revealing that she was taken to Lucknow by the two accused with the support of MLA Sagar. There she was sedated and raped. She was then taken to a house in Delhi where she was raped again by the three men. As the family started building pressure on police to find their daughter and there were several protests seeking justice for them, Tejendra and Neeraj eventually dropped the girl outside a railway station. Arvind Sharma added that the ex-MLA was influential at the time and "used his power to tamper with investigation". He added: “The survivor couldn’t continue her education because of threats from the accused and trauma. She confined herself to her house for several years and lived a miserable life. I spoke to her after the judgement was pronounced and she was extremely happy. She said she lived a nightmare because of the ex-MLA and this judgement has given her hope. She is now happily married with two children."

---||Allahabad||‘Amit Shah will lay foundation of university in Azamgarh on Nov 13’||Gorakhpur: Raising the heat for the Samajwadi Party (SP) ahead of the 2022 state assembly elections, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday announced that Union home minister Amit Shah will lay the foundation of a university in Azamgarh on November 13 and also address a huge rally on the occasion. Azamgarh is the parliamentary constituency of SP president Akhilesh Yadav. Yogi was addressing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) zonal party presidents and zonal party in-charges here on Saturday. Motivating the party workers, Yogi said: “Azamgarh ensured victory for two CMs (SP’s Mulayan Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yaday), but is today itself facing an identity crisis. We are going to give a university to Azamgarh and its foundation will be laid by Amit Shah ji on November 13.” He also appealed to the party workers to start preparations for a huge rally on the occasion, to be held between 12.30 pm and 3 pm, and said that “the place will also get the gift of an airport and expressway”. While attacking the SP, the CM raised the issue of firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya on October 30, 1990. “Every Indian citizen condemned the firing. Those who broke the social net in the name of secularism, either kept quiet or followed an appeasement policy. They tried to call the act right, but when the Supreme Court gave verdict on November 9, 2019 in favour of Ram temple construction, their crime of firing was exposed in front of all.” The CM said that “if they unfortunately return to power, they will repeat their act as only their faces have changed and not their work. When the BJP came to power in 2017, it started a Deepotsav in the honour of Ayodhaya Dham and also as a tribute to the Ram Bhakts.” Yogi asked the party workers to tell the people about the changes that have taken place after 2017 when the BJP came to power in the state. “Earlier, the chief ministers used to make houses for themselves, but we have made houses for 43 lakh people. Similarity, earlier only selected districts used to get power supply, but now all districts are getting it without any discrimination.” Motivating the party workers, the chief minister also mentioned the number of party’s representatives in Parliament, assembly, civic bodies, gram panchayats, etc. “There has been a huge increase in the numbers after the 2017 BJP victory in the state,” he added. Giving victory mantra to the party workers, he asked them to deploy at least 100 workers in each booth, saying “if you win the booth, you win the election”. The CM praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that “abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and construction of Ram temple was possible because of his capable leadership”. He added, “He has not taken a single holiday for the past 7.5 years and worked without bending or stopping.” CM also asked the party workers and state’s 16 lakh officials and employees to celebrate Diwali with the needy, “as there is no fun in celebrating alone”. “Find the welfare schemes beneficiaries and give them diyas, sweets, toran and firesticks to the children.” He gave an example of Bhadohi district where of the 15 lakh people, 10.50 lakh are beneficiaries of government schemes. He said 64 lakh students in the state are getting scholarships. Citing the example of the work done during the coronavirus pandemic, Yogi said, “The party’s mantra is service. This has been proved by the Central and state governments, BJP and RSS during the crisis time. In SP, BSP and Congress governments, the arrangements we made during the corona wave would have been impossible.” The chief minister also highlighted two incidents that took place before 2017 while pointing at the improvement in law and order situation in the state after the BJP assumed power. “I had to go to Azamgarh when a divyang girl was raped and an FIR was not registered. In Gorakhpur, a mafia even tried to encroach the house of a noted personality, Puroshottam Das in Aryanagar.” He also remembered the 2008 incident of Azamgarh when a Vidyarthi Parishad worker was killed in Shibli college.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/amit-shah-will-lay-foundation-of-university-in-azamgarh-on-nov-13/articleshow/87409882.cms||---

We will re-watch The Ring and other classic horror films from the early 2000s, which we had watched as kids and got quite a fright. It will be interesting to see them as adults,” said 31-year-old Arpana Sharma. Student Mark D’Costa has come up with an interesting idea. “I am hosting a marathon of Halloween episodes from some of our favourite English comedy TV series for my friends and cousins. Since it is a weekend, we will have a sleepover and watch Halloween episodes of shows like The Office, Brooklyn 99, It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Modern Family, Friends, etc.” Many clubs are organising Halloween events, too. “I am playing at two different clubs — Titos Pune and Mafia Sky Lounge — over the weekend. Both will have horror house decor, face painting and a costume dress code for guests. We will also be playing the game of Red Light-Green Light, popularised by web series Squid Game. We have arranged for a couple of surprise spooks on the dance floor,” said Yogesh Patil aka DJ Dustin. Some clubs will have all staff dressed in costumes. “We are taking the element of surprise seriously and have arranged for scares for our guests on Saturday. We will get professional makeup artists to facilitate fun and scary makeovers and we are encouraging guests to wear costumes, and the best ones win prizes,” said Vida Heydari, founder, Vida Heydari Contemporary in Koregaon Park. The Halloween masquerade party will also be back at High Spirits Café, with a costume competition, themed food and beverages, and more. “We have been working on the decor for weeks and have cosplayers and actors on board to deliver scares. It is mandatory for guests to attend in costume. We will also have witch-themed and blood-themed cocktails, such as Bleeding Mojito, Witch’s Brew, Red Moon and more to add to the gore. Due to restrictions, we are operating at 50 per cent capacity, and got sold out for the event last week as guests pre-booked their passes,” said Somesh Narwani, manager, High Spirits Cafe, Koregaon Park.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/spooky-feels-across-town-this-halloween/articleshow/87376355.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The suggestion was made during a meeting chaired by the food, civil supplies and consumers affair minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Saturday. During the meeting, Ashu asked the municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal to take strict action against the officials who are responsible for the road cave-in incident in Deep Nagar in which two siblings had a narrow escape. “We are spending large amount on roads even then public is suffering due to road cave-in or even due to poor quality roads. I have asked the MC commissioner to take stringent measures to curb such incidents.” The commissioner has already served show cause notice to the officials concerned of bridges and road department. The minister also asked the officials to inspect the quality of material being used in newly constructed roads. On October 28, a large part of road caved-in in Deep Nagar where two school students fell inside along with their scooter. The students had a narrow escape, but this incident brought to fore the laxity on the part of civic officials. In the meeting, complaints were also made against poor quality of roads. The officials were instructed against construction of roads at night time as night temperature is low. Apart from this, the officials were asked to maintain cleanliness in the city and MC commissioner asked the zonal commissioners to step outside the MC offices to conduct inspections. The officials were asked to do night sweeping in the city for ensuring cleanliness. Later, when chairman of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT), Raman Balasubramanium suggested that IIT Rourkee has some technique to scan roads and it can be checked whether underground structure is safe enough, the cabinet minister has asked the chairman to explore the possibility of its implementation in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/road-cave-ins-civic-body-told-to-explore-iit-roorkee-expertise-to-scan-vulnerable-roads/articleshow/87409939.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||MC lifts 301 stray cattle in 8 months from city roads||Ludhiana: Suffering from lack of space in cow sheds as well as trained catchers, the civic body is finding it hard to pick stray cattle from the city roads. In February, the stray cattle lifting had started again and since then 301 cattle were lifted from the city roads. The officials claimed that since there is a lack of skilled labour, they are unable to quicken the pace. The civic body has an agreement with two shed managements to rehome stray cattle and one more will be signed shortly. One cow shed is Govind Godham at Hambran Road and the other one is at Burj Pawat, Machhiwara. Govind Godham is nearby, but Burj Pawat is at a distance so before sending cattle there, the officials get the cattle lifted to some location within the city first and once they gather sufficient number, they are transported to the cow shed at Burj Pawat. The officials claimed that there is very little space in these cow sheds for the cattle and also the catchers do not catch more than two to three cattle in a day. Requesting anonymity, one of the officials claimed that sometimes there is no driver to run the cattle catching van while sometimes there is some other issue owing to which the work suffers. He said now they are planning to take back their cattle catching vans from Govind Godham (cow shed management catching cattle for MC) and hire their own staff for this task. He said earlier they even planned to get tranquiliser guns but it had to be dropped due to lack of funds. Also, they do not have trained staff to handle the quantity of medicine and the gun. However, senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Singh Dhalla admitted the shortage of skilled labour, but said, “We are trying to increase the pace of cattle lifting from the city roads and very shortly agreement with third cow shed management will also come into operation, more cattle will be shifted from the roads.” Residents troubled with stray cattle A resident of BRS Nagar IP singh said, “When the weather is foggy, stray cattle will become cause of accidents. The authorities should take some concrete steps in this direction.” Meanwhile an activist, Rohit Sabharwal said, “The government has collected large amount in the form of cow cess from public for upkeep of stray cattle, but cows and bulls are still at roads eating the garbage. The authorities should tell us where they spent the cow cess collected from public.” No signs of cattle registration The MC had started pet registration in the city and after that there was planning to start cattle registration in dairies to curb the practice among the dairy farmers to abandon their cattle in the city roads. But till date there is no sign of cattle registration in the city. The officials showed helplessness by saying it was a daunting task to convince the dairy farmers and also they do not have enough staff to get it done. No sight of MC’s own cowshed The civic body had even planned to construct its own cowshed in Noorpur Bet on available land but till date they could not give it concrete shape. The idea was to construct a cow shed so that more cattle could be lifted from the city roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-lifts-301-stray-cattle-in-8-months-from-city-roads/articleshow/87409923.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Doctors transfuse blood in unborn anaemic twins, one survives||SLUG: RARE PROCEDURE Nagpur: Fetal medicine experts from the city performed a sensitive and rare blood transfusion procedure to save unborn twins in the womb after they developed anaemia in the seventh month of pregnancy. However, the severe anaemia took toll on one of the babies which passed away two days after birth. The other baby is healthy, said doctors. The doctors injected the blood through the umbilical cord to ensure they the babies don’t succumb due to lack of red blood cells. The twins were born to a Wardha woman in September. The doctors said this problem (anaemia) is there only till babies are in uterus. After delivery they can be fine if blood transfusion is done in the uterus during pregnancy. The special blood needed for transfusion was arranged by Dr Harish Warbhe. Dr Alhad Mohite and Dr Jitendra Sahu along with their team successfully treated the woman. “Anaemia occurs in Rh positive babies when they are in uterus of Rh negative blood group mothers. It is called Rh Alloimmunization. This occurs due to destruction of red blood cells by development of antibodies against Rh positive red blood cells of the baby,” said Dr Mohite, director of Nagpur Fetal Medicine Centre (NFMC). Dr Sahu, the other director of NFMC, said that recent advances in fetal treatment (fetal therapy) have made this possible and these babies can survive. “Without treatment, such babies die in the uterus,” he said. In August, the pregnant woman was diagnosed with fluid in abdomen and chest of one of the babies baby due to anaemia. She was referred to NFMC by her gynaecologist at Wardha. Problem with the fetus was confirmed by Dr Mohite and Dr Sahu. Initially, the baby with fluid in chest and abdomen was diagnosed to have severe anaemia. “This condition is called hydrops fetalis in which fluid accumulates in various parts of body due to heart failure secondary anaemia. Heart has to pump more quantity of blood since anaemic blood contains less oxygen due to less number of red blood cells. Presence of hydrops reduces chances of survival. Another baby had mild anemia,” said Dr Sahu. Decision of blood transfusion in the baby with severe anemia was taken. “Transfusion was successfully done and there was reduction in anemia which was documented by color doppler,” said Dr Mohite. After transfusion, monitoring by sonography was done every week. After a week, the other baby also started developing anaemia. “Again the patient was referred to NFMC. This time the baby which received transfusion earlier had moderate anaemia and other baby had severe anaemia. The it was decided to transfuse in both babies,” he said. Info  # Fetal blood transfusion - It requires precision and expertise. - Strict protocols for arranging fetal transfusion blood - Various tests done for selecting blood - Unlike routine blood, it has concentrated red blood cells and is very thick - A small blood sample is taken from baby in uterus before deciding quantity of blood to be transfused - Color doppler measurement of maximum flow velocity of blood in a brain artery of baby (middle cerebral artery) can diagnose anaemia and its severity Team Dr Alhad Mohite and Dr Jitendra Sahu.

---||Goa||Give up bravado, no party can defeat BJP alone: GFP chief||PANAJI: All parties that are serious about defeating BJP in the state assembly elections have to put aside their personal differences and come together, said GFP president Vijai Sardesai here on Saturday. Sardesai, who met with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee at the International Centre Goa, said that the delay by the opposition parties to come together benefits BJP. At the same time, Sardesai said that a convergence of like-minded parties was a suitable approach and not a merger of regional parties. He said GFP would discuss and consider Banerjee’s offer before taking any decision, but warned that any party which thinks it can contest the elections alone was operating out of false bravado. “Only with opposition unity can we fulfil the people’s wishes. All parties who are serious of this have to keep their differences and their egos aside and come together,” said Sardesai. “Our assessment is that however big and popular parties think themselves to be, no single party can make sure of a BJP defeat.” The former deputy chief minister met Banerjee along with his party MLAs Jayesh Salgaonkar and Vinod Paliencar, GFP working president Kiran Kandolkar and general secretary for organisational affairs Durgadas Kamat. “The more parties procrastinate and play around, the more the people will get frustrated and more the chances of BJP returning. Our unity efforts have been scoffed at and ignored, but we are determined to create a formidable force to face the elections for the sake of Goa,” said Sardesai. GFP was inching towards TMC a fortnight ago, but talks abruptly broke down, prompting Sardesai to resume talks with Congress. While no clear decision has been taken by either party, Sardesai is keen to forge an alliance with Congress so that the anti-BJP vote is not divided. “I’ve been talking of ‘team Goa’ for two years now and I have said many times that all like-minded parties must unite to overcome the muscle power and money power that will be on display by BJP,” said Sardesai. “Mamata understands the urgent need for unity in Goa. So, we have some common ground in this regard.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/give-up-bravado-no-party-can-defeat-bjp-alone-gfp-chief/articleshow/87411127.cms||---

The drive is likely to continue for two more days in the coming week and will start again post Diwali. Around 70% of students in colleges (data collected so far) are estimated to have received at least one dose. Sonali Rode, joint director of higher education, Mumbai division, said that they are estimating around 1.8 lakh students in the Mumbai region to be eligible for the vaccine. “Many first-year students are not eligible yet. And the second and third year students are giving their exams. As per the data received from colleges, so far, an estimated 70% of the 1.8 lakh students would have received at least their first dose,” said Rode. Over 60 colleges in Mumbai city and suburbs have conducted drives in the first week for their students and also for those in their clusters. At a special drive in Mithibai College on Friday and Saturday, 110 students took their shots. The state's health department, along with the higher and technical education department, had launched a special week-long drive to boost vaccination among students - called the Mission Yuva Swasth Abhiyaan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-city-colleges-vaccinate-29k-students-1-8lto-be-eligible/articleshow/87409966.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Building branch reluctant to take action against violators||Ludhiana: Laxity of civic officials in taking action against the violation of building bylaws has come to fore in response to a fresh complaint by a city-based activist, who had sought vigilance probe into the matter. RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal made a complaint to chief secretary Punjab government and other officials against the civic officials for their inaction and callous attitude. While referring to the provisions under Punjab Municipal Corporation Act 1976, he reminded the municipal town planner (MTP) to issue a letter to the officials concerned for taking action in this regard. Under sections 258, 269 and 270 of Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, there is provision to impose fines against violators. The complaint also mentioned if officials had implemented the orders of the additional chief secretary then not only crores of rupees as fine would have been collected and deposited in the public exchequer, but it would have been a great lesson for the violators. Seeking a vigilance inquiry, the complaint referred to an order dated October 16, 2017, which the officers of the building branch, had failed to comply with. Acting over the complaint of the activist, MTP Surinder Bindra has now issued a letter to the assistant town planners concerned of all four zones to recover the penalty under those sections of building bylaws from the violators. He mentioned in the letter that they were told to take action against violators twice but they did not act due to which the department suffered losses and also the violators were encouraged.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand saw 2nd highest deaths per 1k people among Himalayan states in 2019: Report||Dehradun: At six deaths per 1,000 people, same as the national average, Uttarakhand had the second highest death rate (DR) among the 10 Himalayan states in 2019, second only to Himachal Pradesh, which had a death rate of 6.9 (third worst in the country). Nationally, Chhattisgarh had the highest DR at 7.3, followed by Kerala and Odisha, both of which had 7.1 DR. The figures, for the year 2019, were revealed in the Sample Registration System (SRS) report released by the National Health Mission (NHM). In Uttarakhand, like all other states, the death rate of males, at 6.9, was significantly higher than that of females, which was 5.1. Nationally, the DR of males was 6.5 and females 5.4 in 2019. Also, rural deaths tended to be higher than deaths in urban areas. While the national death rate (DR) in rural areas is 6.5 and in urban areas is 5, the state’s DR is 6.4 in rural areas and 5.1 in urban areas. In good news, the DR has come down from 2018, when it was recorded at 6.2. “The death rate has come down as compared to previous years but its still no better than the national average and the second highest among the Himalayan states. Smaller states with tougher topography and unavailability of healthcare have fared better (Arunachal Pradesh had a DR of 5.8, Manipur 4.3 and Nagaland 3.5). This brings to question the quality and accessibility of healthcare amenities here. We need to focus on improving those, so that the death rate comes down even further,” said Doon-based health expert Anoop Nautiyal, founder of “Social Development for Communities”. Officials, meanwhile, assured that the state was on the right track. “The DR takes into account multiple factors, like maternal deaths, deaths of children below five years of age, deaths due to old age, etc. The DR has gone down and we are working constantly to bring it down further,” said DG Health Dr Tripti Bahuguna. As for the birth rate, Uttarakhand, at 17.1, fared better than the national average of 19.7. Experts believe it’s a good sign, considering the country’s high population problem. The rural birth rate was higher than the urban birth rate at most places. Nationally, the urban birth rate was 16.4 and in the state, it was 16.1. Rural birth rate was also less in the state. In Uttarakhand, it was 17.5, much better than the national average of 21.4. Among the Himalayan states, only Arunachal Pradesh (17.6) and Meghalaya (23.2) have higher birth rates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uttarakhand-saw-2nd-highest-deaths-per-1k-people-among-himalayan-states-in-2019-report/articleshow/87406672.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Nagpur||Revised traffic fines after system update: Cop||Nagpur: Even though the Maharashtra government has announced that fines for various traffic violations, including riding two-wheeler without helmet and driving four-wheeler without seat belt, will be increased, the Nagpur traffic police is yet to receive any communication regarding it. But senior PI Jagvendrasingh Rajput said, “When the fine amounts get updated in our system, it will be implemented automatically.” Traffic experts welcomed the move. MP and vice-president of MP Road Safety Committee Dr Vikas Mahatme said that Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had amended the MV Act in 2019 just to save lives in road accidents. “The fines had been increased not to generate revenue,” he said. Mahatme urged motorists to abide by the MV Act which has been framed for their safety. Traffic expert and Janakrosh member Ashok Karandikar said the increase will act as a deterrent to motorists “only then the violations can be curbed”. “There should also be a system to ensure 100% recovery of fine,” he added. Karandikar also pointed out that the enforcement of traffic rules and regulations should be in force round the clock. At present, violators are being fined only during working hours of traffic police (9 am to 7 pm or 8 pm). Currently, the fine for helmet-less driving is Rs 500 and without seatbelt Rs 200. According to traffic police data, from January 1 to October 27, 1,91,920 and 41,092 two-wheeler and four-wheeler drivers, respectively, have been penalised. Though the cops are taking action and in 10 months around 7,77,935 violators were penalised for various traffic violations and Rs 9.95 crore recovered as fine, it has failed to reduce the violations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/revised-traffic-fines-after-system-update-cop/articleshow/87408216.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The police said they are interrogating the couple. While a case has been registered, no arrest has been made so far. The matter came to light when the complainant, a singer, came across an advertisement on pornographic content while browsing the Internet last December. What got his attention was a couple in the teaser video whom he recognised. Officials of Naya Nagar police station said that the complainant created a login id, paid the subscription fee and got onto the link that featured live sexual shows. He identified the couple as Mira Road residents. The couple streamed live sex and even sought viewers’ suggestions. The police said that live streaming of sexual acts has gone up since the lockdown. Officials said that a number of couples were found in such acts on social media platforms. Police said that the sexual acts are also used to sell libido pills. Police said they are ascertaining if the acts were done under duress. They are also verifying if the couple have any role in prostitution racket in which a woman who was running the online racket was arrested recently. Photos of girls were sent to customers on their cellphones and sexual acts were carried out in hotels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-couple-who-streamed-sexual-act-live-for-a-fee-booked/articleshow/87409995.cms||---

His friend, unidentified in the FIR, was also booked. This comes just days after police in Agra booked three Kashmiri students for cheering Pakistan’s victory. They were held under sedition and cyber-terrorism charges along with other sections of the IPC. Circle officer (Barla), Suman Kanaujia, said the complainant, Vinay Varshney, had come across the post on social media and had filed the police complaint. According to police, both the accused have been charged under sections 153-A (promoting enmity), 295-A (acts intended to outrage religious feelings), 298 (deliberate intention of wounding religious feelings), 505 (1) (b) (intent to cause fear or alarm to the public) of the IPC and section 66 of the IT Act (computer related offence). The complainant, Varshney, who is BJP Yuva Morcha's former general secretary of Akrabad mandal in Aligarh, alleged that after reading the online post, he went to Farukh’s house where he and his friend raised "pro-Pakistan slogans". Such acts hurt religious and national sentiments of Indians, it was alleged in the FIR filed by Varshney at Akrabad police station. When contacted, a relative of Farukh claimed that he told him that he had left his mobile phone while going to the washroom, on October 24, when he and a few others were watching the cricket match together. Someone else meanwhile had posted an "objectionable" comment along with a video clip of the match from his Facebook account without his knowledge, the accused’s kin said, adding that the post was later deleted by Farukh. UP Police had earlier arrested one person from Sitapur for posting a status on WhatsApp in "support" of the neighbouring country. He was booked under IPC sections 507 (criminal intimidation by anonymous communication) and 151 (knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse). Another person was arrested from Badaun for posting a picture of the Pakistan flag. He had been booked under section 124-A (sedition).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/22-yr-old-man-from-aligarh-arrested-for-celebrating-paks-t-20-win-against-india/articleshow/87406698.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

In fact, the mela is offering an even bigger array of items — from candles, paper bags and terracotta items decorated by the trainees to clothing items, decorative pieces, shawls and upholstery. However, due to the requirements of anti-Covid protocols, the scale of the event has been reduced and the usual food stalls have been done away with this year. K C Pande, executive secretary, Blind Relief Association, said, “Usually we have around 260 stalls for all the sales, but this year we have just 70 stalls. In a bid to ensure implementation of Covid norms, each of the stalls is much more spacious this time and, therefore, offer people enough safe space to walk leisurely.” While the main mela will be held till November 1, Pande said that products made by the vocational trainees will be sold till Diwali three days later. The truncated scale of the event has had no effect on the items that are on sale as evident from the bright jewellery, stitched items and papier-mache products made by the vocational trainees on display. While there were long queues in the area where 60-70 different kinds of candles were being sold, in the workshops, staff members and volunteers continued making the products along with the trainees. “We have a multi-skill programme that aims to help the trainees become skilled in certain vocations and equips them to start a venture of their own. That is why we expose them to numerous skills such as candles, paper products and stitching,” said Pande. For those visiting the mela and feeling tired after moving among the stalls, there is a massage counter that offers a foot massage. Zubair Khan, a vocational trainee at the counter, said, “I have received massaging training for six months. This is the first time that I am a part of the Diwali Mela and I am having a great time. We have our classes and hostels on the complex, and it is a great experience for me.” The 22-year-old added, “While I want to take undergraduate admission in Delhi University next year, I thought of undertaking a vocational course to improve my prospects. It is not easy to get a government job as the competition is steep. For me, therefore, it was best that I picked up a skill that can help me in the future in terms of a possible vocation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/after-c-break-diwali-mela-back-in-new-form/articleshow/87411787.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Dehradun||Ahead of Shah’s visit, Muslim body sends memo to protest Tripura violence||Dehradun: Members of the Muslim community in Dehradun led by the Muslim Seva Sangathan (MSS) have submitted a memorandum addressed to Union home minister Amit Shah to the district magistrate which condemned alleged attacks on the minority community in Tripura and demanded strict action against the perpetrators. The memorandum was sent ahead of Shah's visit to Dehradun on Saturday to kick off the BJP's poll campaign in the state. Communal violence has engulfed the northeastern state over the past week in retaliation to violence in neighbouring Bangladesh which erupted during Durga Puja festivities earlier this month. The memorandum read: “The Tripura government is not conducting any inquiry against the anti-social Hindutva elements which is disappointing the entire Muslim community of India. We demand that a fair probe should be conducted in this matter and strict action should be taken against the rioters. This will maintain democracy and communal harmony in India.” Naeem Qureshi, president of the MSS, told TOI the community has condemned the attacks against Hindus in Bangladesh during Durga Puja celebrations, but it was “unfair to target innocent members of the Tripura’s Muslim community because of what has happened in Bangladesh”. “Several mosques are being vandalised. An investigation committee should be appointed to conduct a fair investigation and punish the perpetrators. But till now nothing has been done by the state or the Central government. Muslims have sacrificed for this nation as much as Hindus. Therefore, they (Muslims) also deserve justice like everybody else,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ahead-of-shahs-visit-muslim-body-sends-memo-to-protest-tripura-violence/articleshow/87406703.cms||Mohammad Anab

They have also appealed to the gram sabhas to observe ‘Kali Diwali’ to protest the “high-handedness of the police and district administration”. Ramdas Jarate, an activist of Shetkari Kamgar Sanghatna, who was among the half-a-dozen leaders arrested from the site of agitation, held police responsible for wrenching his mobile phone and taking him around barefoot in half pants. “The senior inspector, who seized my and wife’s phones, is now saying he doesn’t have them. They are planning to plant something in the mobile phone to implicate me,” he alleged. Jarate also said that the protest to demand cancellation of mining leases to Surjagarh and around 25 companies would continue. “As per the bail condition, we would not be able to lead the masses but the struggle would continue at the individual level. Our Shetkari Kamgar Party would seek meeting with the chief minister and home minister over the issue,” he said. Normalcy seems to be returning at Etapalli. Police and security intelligence departments have stepped up vigilance in the southern part of the Maoist-affected district. Sources said work was stopped at the mining site for a day after the eviction of the protesters. The work resumed on Saturday with police department beefing up the security at and around the mining site 15 km away in the backdrop of rumours that protesters might return. The intelligence agencies are not ruling out possibility of a backlash. Sources stated that the protesters are miffed after being forcibly evicted even after having conducting a peaceful agitation. Senior police officials were not available for comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/protesters-flay-police-admn-for-disrupting-surjagarh-agitation/articleshow/87408247.cms||Soumitra Bose

And to welcome the customers, market associations have put up colourful illuminations and decorations and are taking care to implement all Covid precautions. “We are happy that finally people are coming in good numbers and to encourage them, we decorated the market a week ago and even organised a Karvachauth event,” said Rajendra Sharda of the M Block GK I traders’ body. “Though the normal Diwali rush is still missing, there are shoppers coming now and we are offering discounts to attract more.” At Kamla Nagar, all commercial areas including the golchakkars, GT Road and other lanes are illuminated. “After the lull with no sales and heavy losses for two years, everyone is trying their best to attract customers,” explained Nitin Gupta, president, Kamla Nagar Market Association. “We take regular corrective action as directed by the SDM’s office. Though we can’t reduce the crowd, we are taking care to ensure physical distancing and masks.” Gupta said the market association was taking the help of local police in meeting anti-Covid imperatives. It is also summoning the municipal corporation staff regularly to collect waste. “But yes, encroachment in the market is a concern because all corridors are choked by hawkers, forcing pedestrians on to the chaotic roads,” admitted Gupta At Lajpat Nagar, the market association has decided to decorate the area only two days before Diwali to avoid unnecessary crowding. “As of now, only committed buyers are coming to the market for Diwali purchases. Once we install the lights, others who just wanted to enjoy the Diwali decorations will also start coming to the market,” explained Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar. Marwah said that the market association has provided volunteers to help the cops and civil defence personnel in handling the shoppers. “We are holding regular meetings with the traffic police and Delhi Police for safety, security and strict implementation of Covid norms. We also had a meeting at the district magistrate’s office two weeks ago to discuss festive period plans, and civil defence volunteers were provided to us in sufficient numbers,” said Marwah. “To assist the local police, the market association has already deployed 10 volunteers and five more will be employed Sunday onwards. They are requesting people to wear masks and carry extra masks to offer those who don’t have them.” At Green Park Market though the footfall is average at best. The shop owners are still happy that the people are coming back. “It seems the joy and happiness have returned after a very disturbing phase in the city,” smiled Vijay Israni, vice-president, Green Park Market Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/diwali-shoppers-bring-back-cheer-for-markets/articleshow/87411795.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||BJP troubling sanitation staff for past 15 years, alleges AAP||New Delhi: AAP MLAs on Saturday alleged that the BJP-ruled corporations in the last 15 years have left no stone unturned in troubling the sanitation workers and did not regularise their services. In the recent House proceedings, AAP councillors raised the issue and pushed for their regularisation. “BJP has been promising regularisation in their manifesto since 2012. We came to know about talks in the official agenda before north corporation’s standing committee about regularising a mere 500 of these employees. This number is extremely reprehensible given that 6,646 sanitation workers are engaged in the corporation, to whom the BJP has been repeatedly promising regularisation,” AAP MLAs Kuldeep Kumar, Rakhi Birla and Rohit Mehraulia said in a joint press conference at party headquarters. MLA Rakhi Birla said that BJP is conspiring to break the spirits of the Valmiki community and is trying to weaken them financially and mentally by regularising only a handful of its employees. Rohit Mehraulia stated that it was a shame for BJP that they have compelled their employees to work like slaves. AAP is planning a protest over the issue. “AAP is committed to ensure regularisation of all 6,646 sanitation workers and we will launch a mass movement for the purpose,” Kumar said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said all sanitation workers engaged before 2003 are being regularised under north corporation and the process will be completed by mid-2022. “Sanitation workers know that the civic bodies will regularise their employees in batches,” Kapoor said, accusing the AAP government of financially crippling the municipal corporations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-troubling-sanitation-staff-for-past-15-years-alleges-aap/articleshow/87411803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Being apolitical and dedicated service helped gain trust in Kerala: Dr Sagdeo||Nagpur: Padma Shri awardee Dr Dhananjay Sagdeo, who was born and brought up in Nagpur, has been working in the tribal-dominated Muttil area of Wayanad district in Kerala for more than four decades. He will be presented the Padma Shri at Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi, on November 9. He arrived in the city on Saturday. Before leaving for the national capital, he will celebrate Diwali with his family and friends here. Dr Sagdeo has dedicated his life to health care of tribal people in the hilly and remote regions of Kerala. He said earning personal respect and trust was the most important part of his journey. The political scene in Kerala is left-dominated while Dr Sagdeo is a worker of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). “I had left Nagpur and joined the one-room clinic run by the Vivekanand Health mission in Muttil as directed by the then RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras,” he said. According to him, learning local language and knowing the tribal way of life were the basic steps needed to interact with the locals. “But, the bigger task was to convince them that their work had no political or religious motive. Over the years, I have established that ours is a social work which has nothing to do with any political ideology or vote bank,” said Dr Sagdeo. “We treat every needy person, irrespective of their religion or political ideology. That is why even Maoists allowed us to conduct health camps in deep forest areas,” he said. It’s not that he has not received threats from the extremists, but Dr Sagdeo said that “work speaks louder than the political stand”. “Tribal people still prefer our 35-bed hospital over government’s bigger facilities. This is the trust that we gained over decades of dedicated service. Even for Covid-19 vaccination, ours was the most preferred centre,” he said. Kerala is one of the worst-hit states when it comes to Covid-19. According to Dr Sagdeo, this has made even tribal people aware of vaccines. “The second wave was devastating in Kerala. Entire colonies of tribal people were infected. Fortunately, the disease was not very serious in these people. Eventually, the disease exposure made them realize the importance of vaccine,” he said. Vaccination was done in good numbers, he said, thanks to the the strong public health system in the state. “The third wave is not likely, at least in Kerala. “Zero Covid is not possible at all. But, there will be no wave now. Smaller surges may happen,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/being-apolitical-and-dedicated-service-helped-gain-trust-in-kerala-dr-sagdeo/articleshow/87408266.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed the interim order on Friday while hearing the petition filed by P Rajamani, whose fishing vessel was damaged in a collision with the cargo ship about 19 nautical miles off Colachel harbour in Kanyakumari on October 22. The vessel ‘Shij Mon – I’ with 17 crew members and the ship collided around 8.15 pm, leaving the crew injured and the vessel damaged. Two of the injured were taken ashore by Indian Coast Guard while the others reached the shore with the damaged boat with the help of fishermen from two other boats.  The petitioner contended that the ship flies with a Panama flag and if permitted to sail beyond our territorial waters, he and the injured fishermen will be left without remedy. Taking into account this contention, Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the authorities to detain the cargo ship for three weeks at Mumbai port. The court ordered notice to the official respondents and the ship, and adjourned the case to November 26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/madras-hc-orders-ship-in-mumbai-port-be-detained/articleshow/87410024.cms||---

---||Delhi||Penalised for not donating for the Ram temple, headmistress tells Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has issued notice on a plea filed by the headmistress of a school alleging that she was suspended by the administration for not donating money towards construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The woman also claimed she was underpaid. Seeking directions to overturn her suspension and restore her job with full back wages, the woman alleged that she was being penalised for not being able to donate money for the temple project. While claiming that she was abruptly transferred to Bhalswa branch of the school in August last year without any reason, the plea alleged that she was not given the time to collect all the diaries and other belongings of her from the school. “The target to collect or contribute Rs 70,000 to Rs 1,00,000 has been given by the society in February 2021 to all the staff of all the schools managed by the respondent society, for the purpose of construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The staff have been asked to convince students or their parents to contribute or to visit the marketplace for donation from shopkeepers or the general public. The petitioner, being not the class teacher of any class, also not being in the position to contribute herself because of poor financial health of her family, expressed her inability to contribute the amount of Rs 70,000 for the charitable purpose,” the plea alleged. “And this was in addition to the yearly donation amount in the name of Samarpan, which has been raised from Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000. The petitioner has been coerced to contribute the said amounts of Rs 70,000 for Ram Mandir and Rs 15,000 for Samarpan, whereas despite extreme financial constraints, the petitioner donated Rs 2,100 for Ram Mandir on 03.03.2021 and further refused to pay any amount for Samarpan this year,” it claimed further. Advocate Khagesh Jha informed the court that the teacher’s husband met with a serious accident in 2016 and lost vision in one eye, multiple fractures and had to insert three rods in leg during surgery and some neurological disorder, because of which he has been suffering from epileptic attacks occasionally. In such a condition, there is a huge financial burden on the family for his treatment, but still the RSS-backed Samarth Shiksha Samiti, which runs the school, has been coercing his client, he alleged. The plea further claimed the teacher was being “falsely accused” of making casteist remarks by a few parents at the behest of the school.

Also, when compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic), the growth has been even bigger. Between January and October, registration of CNG vehicles in Pune grew by 274% in 2020 as compared to 2019, and 227% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Registration of CNG vehicles in Pimpri Chinchwad registered a growth of around 9200% in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 208% in 2021 as compared to 2020. “The registration of e-vehicles has seen a major growth in both the corporations. This shows that the inclination of people to buy vehicles which run on alternative fuel has increased greatly. And our calculations and analysis say that the same has happened mainly due to frequent rise in cost of petrol and diesel since last year,” Shailesh Bhandari, Pune regional director, Federation of Automobile Associations, and director, BU Bhandari Auto, told TOI. Another vehicle dealer said that registration of CNG vehicles was almost unheard of until 2018. “In 2018, only 49 CNG vehicles were registered in Pune RTO. In 2017, only 38 CNG vehicles were registered. At the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO office, 27 CNG vehicles were registered in 2018, while only 18 vehicles were registered in 2017. Since 2019, the registrations of CNG vehicles slowly started to rise,” the dealer said. “Earlier, while petrol prices were increasing, diesel prices used to be under control. Now both are going neck and neck,” Sujit Patwardhan, founder, Parisar, an NGO, said. Dealers said CNG vehicles have a low running cost compared to petrol or diesel. “Apart from this, their maintenance cost is also low. One can recover the cost of these vehicles much faster than those running on petrol and diesel. The registration of CNG, CNG/petrol variant and e-vehicles will only go up now,” Bhandari said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rise-in-fuel-cost-drives-up-registration-of-cng-cars/articleshow/87406746.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Despite supply woes, gadget demand spikes||PUNE: After a damp squib in 2020, dealers in appliances and electronic gadgets in the city say that the loosened restrictions amid festive season have helped sales in the category to match or even exceed pre-pandemic levels, with particular movement in home appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators. Dealers added that an upward revision in prices for most products does not seem to be much of an impediment when it comes to purchases, with low levels of supply in some categories, especially personal gadgets. “We have witnessed a lot of demand compared to 2020, even with the prices of most electronics inching up in the last few months. The situation is that due to supply-related difficulties, such as the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage, manufacturers are not being able to send the volumes that are required to match the demand. This is especially true in the case of mobile phones and laptops, where the waiting times for some models are up to a month or even more. This is disappointing for a lot of our customers, who came to specifically shop for a certain model of phone or computer, but deferred their purchase or settled for something else,” said the manager of a large electronics outlet in Aundh. Manufacturers added that while demand has significantly improved, the overall market is still a journey towards normalcy. “Even though there has been a significant uptick in consumer spending, the white goods industry is still witnessing a return to normalcy. We expect the hybrid working routine to further fuel demand for functional home appliances as people try to adjust back to their earlier lives and continue to rely on technology. Since the lockdown ended, we are witnessing a good pickup in demand for newer categories like dishwashers and washer-dryers, which we expect will continue to gain popularity over the next few months as the market penetration is low and there is a lot of room to grow,” said a spokesperson from the Tata-owned consumer electronics firm Voltas. Others added that while supply chain difficulties are having a lesser effect on manufacturing and sales in the ongoing festive season, the effects may be felt more in the summer months. “Consumer sentiment is good, and overall sales have increased by around 15-20% in recent months, after the restrictions were loosened during the festive season. However, challenges remain regarding supply chain issues, such as the shortage of some inputs and the high cost of freight. There are resurgences of Covid in China and Southeast Asia, which is causing container and chip shortages. While the effects are not being felt as much now, they will be felt slightly more in the months when air-conditioner sales are at their peak,” said Vikas Gupta, managing director of operations at PG Electroplast, a contract electronics manufacturer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/despite-supply-woes-gadget-demand-spikes/articleshow/87406768.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Industry observers said that overall volumes were still on the lower side as compared to the pre-pandemic era with companies keeping a leash on expenses and finalising their gifting strategies with their communication teams or vendors only at the last moment unlike earlier, when such things used to be decided months in advancce. In a recent interaction with TOI, Indraneel Chitale, managing partner, Pune-based Chitale group, said that the gifting space has been recovering this year vis-a-vis last year. “Both start-ups and corporate houses are placing orders for gift packs, with many opting for healthy product ranges,” he said. Others added that companies are still trying to keep cost in check while cautiously restarting festive season gifting through traditional gifts such as sweets and dry fruits rather than slightly more expensive white goods or innovative packaging. “The situation is slightly better than last year, but overall gifting is still slow. They are also not innovating too much in terms of products and packaging and are sticking to traditional sweets and dry fruit package,” said a communication consultant based in Pune.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/corporate-gifting-slow-focus-on-healthy-products/articleshow/87406802.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Dehradun||Traffic moves at snail’s pace in city amid Shah’s visit, festive rush||Dehradun: Amid Union minister Amit Shah’s visit and festive rush, traffic moved at a snail’s pace in the city, with people coming in droves for festival shopping. This despite Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar chalking out a well-thought-out traffic plan. Cops had a tough time diverting traffic to alternative routes, with vehicles moving at a snail’s pace, especially around Rajpur road. Long queues of vehicles were witnessed after a political party staged a protest at Gandhi park, impacting the traffic flow. The chaos was such that motorists were unable to find a parking slot outside shops. Manoj Rathi, a businessman said, “I stepped out for Diwali shopping today but did not know about the chaotic situation. I stay near Nehru colony, where the traffic movement was normal, but when I reached Rajpur road, the rush was maddening. Finding a parking slot, too, became cumbersome.” Another, resident who came to Paltan Bazaar from Jakhan said, “I came on a two-wheeler to avoid being stuck in traffic jams but that, too, did not help. I was not able to move my bike even a bit.” To avoid recurrence of such chaos on Dhanteras, DGP Ashok Kumar has asked officials to ensure that vehicular movement remains prohibited in markets. In addition, he has also instructed Cheetah police team to manage traffic along with attending to emergency calls. Adequate availability of cranes will be ensured in no-parking zones and at prohibited areas. The outpost in-charge and station officers, too, have been asked to chip in and regulate traffic. Parking slots earmarked Traffic police said more than 80 vehicles have been towed in the past two days for wrong parking. For the convenience of people during the festive season, some major parking spots have been identified. Vehicles coming from Rajpur road can be parked at MDDA parking and on the left lane between Drashanlal Chowk and Lansdowne Chowk. For vehicles coming from Saharanpur and Prince chowk, Nagar Nigam office parking and Rajiv Gandhi shopping complex can be used.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/traffic-moves-at-snails-pace-in-city-amid-shahs-visit-festive-rush/articleshow/87406793.cms||---
---||India||Bypolls: High turnout seen in most assembly, Lok Sabha seats||NEW DELHI: A turnout of 50 percent to 90 percent was recorded in three Lok Sabha and 29 assembly constituencies spread across 13 states during by-elections on Saturday, with INLD leader Abhay Chautala, who quit the Haryana assembly in protest against the new agri laws, and Congress’ Pratibha Singh, wife of late chief minister Virbhadra Singh, among the prominent candidates in the fray. The voting passed off peacefully and it was ensured that all Covid-19 safety measures were followed, officials said. In Haryana, 80 percent voting was recorded in the by-election to the Ellenabad Assembly constituency, necessitated by the resignation of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Chautala as MLA in protest against the Centre’s new farm laws. Chautala, son of INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, is contesting against Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal and BJP-JP candidate Gobind Kanda, the brother of Haryana Lokhit Party chief and legislator Gopal Kanda. In Himachal Pradesh, Mandi Lok Sabha seat from where Pratibha Singh is contesting saw a turnout of 57.73 percent. She was pitted against BJP’s Khushal Singh Thakur, a Kargil war hero who is trying his luck at the hustings for the first time. The Mandi seat fell vacant after the death of Ramswaroop Sharma (BJP) in March. Besides the three assembly seats in HP, bypolls were held in five assembly seats in Assam, four in West Bengal, three each in Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan and one seat each in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Mizoram and Telangana. Out of these, the BJP was holding around half a dozen seats, the Congress had nine, while the rest were with the regional parties. The counting of votes is on November 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bypolls-high-turnout-seen-in-most-assembly-lok-sabha-seats/articleshow/87412423.cms||---
---||Goa||Political tourists can’t dent our strength in Goa: BJP||PANAJI: Reacting to the visit of Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and AAP functionaries to poll-bound Goa, BJP youth wing national president Tejasvi Surya on Saturday said that none of these’ political tourists’ will be able to dent BJP’s strength in Goa for the record third time under the leadership of chief minister Pramod Sawant. BJP will form a full majority government in 2022, he added. Surya said that TMC stands for terrorism, mafia and corruption and that Goa rejects all these three things wholly and totally. He said that the 2022 elections is ‘Sawant versus political tourists’, and that this would be the election narrative of 2022. Surya said that Congress today has no leader, no cadre and no policy. “All that Gandhi can do is visit Goa to improve the tourism potential by coming here and staying for two days and spending some of the party’s money. Nothing will come out of his political trip,” he said. The youth wing president said that Congress and their political tourists in Goa cannot offer development or a bright vision for Goa and that is why they will be rejected. “Whoever comes to the state will enjoy the tourism season and return. AAP, too, is a non-starter in Goa,” he said. Pointing out to Banerjee’s posters across the state, Surya said, “TMC is only to be found on hoardings in Goa. It has neither a cadre, nor organisation, nor policy. What can Banerjee — who is known for misrule of West Bengal — offer to Goa which is already under a great government under BJP,” he said. “What will the one who has created much unrest, terrorism and poverty in West Bengal give to the happy and prosperous people of Goa?” The BJP youth wing president warned cadres of all political parties and every democratic Goan that TMC will bring along with it “its violent nature of politics and its terrorism-driven and violence-driven political model”. “If there is no peace in Goa, there will be no tourism. Tourism and terrorism cannot exist together,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bjp-political-tourists-cant-dent-our-strength-in-goa/articleshow/87411221.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: FYJC admissions end after 12 rounds; 1.6 lakh seats vacant||PUNE: The First Year of Junior College (FYJC) admissions for the 2021-22 academic year ended on Saturday after 12 rounds of the process in the Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik and Amravati metropolitan regions with over 1.6 lakh seats still remaining vacant. The numbers of vacant seats in the state after completion of the FYJC admissions were 1.81 lakh in 2020-2021 and 1.9 lakh in 2019-2020. This year, the Centralised Admission Process (CAP) committee held the first four rounds in the online mode. The rest of the admissions was held on the first-come-first-serve basis on the central admission portal. Altogether 1,66,632 seats (33.25% of the total intake) are still lying vacant in the five metropolitan regions of the state. Nagpur has the highest vacancy at 43%, followed by Amravati (35%) and Pune (34%). CAP committee conducts online centralized admissions in the five metropolitan areas of Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik and Amravati. In the rest of the areas, admissions are conducted at the college level. For example, In Pune, CAP conducts admissions online in a centralized manner for all junior colleges in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic areas. But junior colleges in the Pune rural area are not a part of this. Madhuri Chittewan, principal of Dr Kalmadi Shamarao Junior College, said while both arts and commerce divisions were full, the science division had vacancies. She said, “The vacancy in the science division started since the pandemic started last year. One possible reason for the vacancies can be that students from outside Pune are not enrolling in science because they are not sure whether the practical classes will be held or not. As this is not the case with online classes in commerce and arts, more students have got enrolled in these two departments instead of science.” Chittewan said financial crunch in families triggered by the pandemic could also be a reason that many people did not send their wards to bigger cities. “Another reason can be that many students who would have opted for science might have gone for vocational or other technical courses," she said. Meena Shendkar, the assistant director of education, had told TOI during the admission process that there were lower registrations this year. “Many students are not travelling to cities due to the fear of contracting Covid-19. They are choosing colleges nearby to complete their classes XI and XII,” she said. “Pune used to get a high number of students from other parts of the state — especially Marathwada and Vidarbha. The number is now reducing. The renowned colleges are, however, still getting good responses. Seats in such colleges are getting filled in the first three or four rounds of the Centralised Admission Process,” Shendkar said. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said the college had only one vacant seat. “A student left the college after taking admission. Our classes have also started in both the offline and online modes. The number of students from outside has comparatively reduced.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/fyjc-admissions-end-after-12-rounds-1-6l-seats-vacant/articleshow/87406854.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Dehradun||FSSAI certification for ‘Mahaprasad’ of Kainchi Dham||Dehradun: The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is set to certify “malpua” -- the “mahaprasad” of renowned Kainchi Dham temple -- established by Neem Karoli Baba, who even after his death continues to enchant tech titans and celebrities. The initial deliberations between the Food Safety and Drug Administration team and staff of the temple, which in the past has witnessed international devotees like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Steve Jobs, both sides have given, in principle, approval to the certification of the “mahaprasad’. Designated officer, FSSAI, Haldwani Sanjay Singh told TOI, “We had an initial round of talk with the Kainchi Dham staff and after a positive feedback, we will soon discuss the remaining factors.” He pointed out that the FSSAI was running a campaign --Blissful Hygiene Offered to God (BHOG) -- under which the “prasad” offered to the almighty and thereafter, distributed among devotees is certified by the agency. The motive behind the move is to ensure that the “prasad’ is hygienic and safe for consumption. “The first step is getting the consent from temple authorities and the second is auditing, which has two rounds. We train the staff and check the infrastructure; and suggest the required changes,” he said. “Thereafter, we check that medical tests of staff making “prasad” are done or not. We also inspect the quality of raw material and give a formal shape to the entire process. Through these efforts we ensure that the bhog given to devotees is fit for consumption,” he added. The FSSAI has already certified the “prasad" of Maa Chandi Devi Mandir in Haridwar, Gita Kuteer and Tapowan Haridwar. The food safety and drug administration department has received consent for certification of bhog at Kedarnath, Gangotri Dham and Sidhbali temple at Kotdwar. Other places of worship under deliberations are Mansa Devi Temple, Shantikunj, Gurdwara Nanakmatta, Maa Surkunda Devi temple, Badrinath Dham, Haat Kalika Temple at Gangolihaat and Gurdwara Reetha Sahib Champawat. “Under the bhog programme, we have identified temples in each of the 13 districts,” Singh added. It is believed that Neem Karori Baba had miraculous powers. He came to the area in 1942 and set up the Kainchi Dham in 1962. Located at an altitude of about 1,400m on the Nainital-Almora road, on the banks of the Shipra river, the name ‘kainchi’ for the ashram is derived from the two sharp hairpin bends on the road. Besides, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Steve Jobs – who reportedly came here in the 1970s when the saint was still alive but could not meet him – a number of other prominent foreign celebrities have been regular visitors to Kainchi Dham. They include Hollywood actress Julia Roberts; Ram Dass, also known as Dr Richard Alpert, a researcher on the effects of the drug LSD; musicians Jai Uttal and Krishna Das; humanitarian Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who was associated with Google's philanthropic arm google.org, as well as bestselling author Daniel Goleman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/fssai-certification-for-mahaprasad-of-kainchi-dham/articleshow/87406849.cms||Kautilya Singh

The project is in its preliminary discussion stage. He said a site was yet to be identified. “This was part of a preliminary discussion, seeing the needs of the region. However, we will initiate the process soon,” Thackeray told TOI. Officials said with Mumbai airport being used to its full potential and the delayed Navi Mumbai airport too may be insufficient to meet requirements, the state government was considering a third airport. Airline officials lauded the decision but air safety experts warned against early announcements, citing developments after the Navi Mumbai airport project was announced. “Builders lapped up land around the proposed Navi Mumbai airport and the area went into a construction frenzy,’’ said an aviation source. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) grants a no-objection certificate (NOC) for height clearance of buildings that are within a 20km radius of an airport. For instance, buildings within a 4km radius from airport centre point can be a maximum of only 45m tall (around 15 storeys). “But for Navi Mumbai airport, Cidco started granting NOCs for building heights in accordance with AAI norms only after 2012, which was decades after the airport project was announced,’’ the source said. “Some buildings to the east of the proposed airport, such as those in Khandeshwar and Kamothe that received an NOC before 2012, might be found to be too tall for structures that fall under the aircraft approach path of Navi Mumbai airport’s two parallel runways 26,’’ said the source. Before the airport is commissioned, an obstacle survey will be carried out. Some buildings may be served a notice for height reduction, but runways will have a “displaced threshold’’, that is a shorter length of runway will be deemed usable for take-offs/landings due to obstructions along the aircraft approach path. “This could lead to problems for heavy aircraft operations, and this is not how an airport should be planned,” the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-aaditya-gives-wings-to-plan-for-third-airport-at-palghar/articleshow/87410150.cms||Bhavika Jain

Gadkari was remotely addressing the 66th annual convention of the Deccan Sugar Technologists’ Association (DSTA), at Pune’s Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHADA). The minister said the Centre is working on plans to make ‘flex’ engines for vehicles mandatory, which can run on blended fuels of petroleum and ethanol, or 100% of each as well. “It is essential to ensure maximum conversion of sugar cane to ethanol. India spends a lot of money buying fuel, and increased ethanol production is needed to reduce fuel imports,” said Gadkari. “Farmers will also get good prices for sugar cane; the future of the sugar industry is linked to ethanol production. We are currently not producing the required amount of ethanol, and much more is needed,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/gadkari-sugar-industrys-future-hinges-on-ethanol/articleshow/87406867.cms||---

The preliminary polling figures suggested that at least 75.51 percent votes were polled out of the total 2.58 lakh registered voters in the UT. No untoward incident was reported during the 12 hours of polling from 7 am to 7 pm. “Polling was completed peacefully and no unexpected incident took place anywhere in the UT. Police had installed tight bandobast to ensure smooth polling,” said Hareshwar Swami, superintendent of police, DNH. Total 1,700 police force was deployed to ensure polling remains smooth and peaceful. Apart from 300 cops of DNH police, additional 10 companies of CAPF, four companies of Gujarat police and one company of Daman police were deployed. “Among precautionary measures, 10 flying squads, 18 static surveillance teams, 10 checkpoints, six quick response teams, two arrest parties and two striking reserve teams were pressed on duty,” Swami told TOI. In the past 30 days, police seized 6,500 liquor bottles from unauthorised possession and Rs 1 crore in cash was seized. Candidates of three leading parties — BJP, Congress and Shiv Sena — were contesting the election on the seat that was vacant after the death of independent MP, Mohan Delkar, who’s body was found in a Mumbai hotel in February 2021. Delkar defeated Natu Patel of BJP by 9001 votes fighting in 2019 as an Independent candidate. Patel was BJP MP for consecutive two terms since 2009. Delkar was MP from the seat consecutively for six terms since 1989 as he contested as candidate of Congress, BJP and independent. His father Sanjibhai also got elected in 1967 as MP from the seat.

Teachers too played their part to make the initiative a success.”She said while the city corporation workers would come and clean the school premises, it would take some time as they had to cover many schools. “Hence, we decided to do the job ourselves.” According to her, Santhosh Kumar, a parent, had brought his friends to paint the benches. Teachers too joined them and cleaned the classrooms.”Another parent, Kanthasamy, meanwhile, brought some workers and cleaned water tanks and sumps, she said. “We have completed two rounds of cleaning the entire premises and are ready to welcome students on Monday.”The school offers various extracurricular activities and has an android application that connects teachers, students and parents smoothly. The school has a strength of 350 students in primary classes (I to IV) and 105 in upper primary classes (V to VIII). With the school still receiving applications for admissions, the city corporation has decided to construct five more classrooms at a cost of Rs 55 lakh. “A private firm has already contributed Rs 26 lakh for the same under the ‘Namakku Naame Thittam’ initiative,” a corporation official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/teachers-parents-ready-corporation-middle-school-at-masakalipalayam-for-reopening/articleshow/87408423.cms||---

The day also saw 14,353 people in the district taking their first dose of vaccine. A health official said they had inoculated 71,166 people in total on the day, when more than 1,112 vaccination camps were organized as part of the mega drive. While 841 vaccination camps were organized in rural areas, urban areas hosted 271 camps. The official said 27.07 lakh of the 38.67 lakh population in the district was eligible to take the jab. “As on Friday, 12.01 lakh people had taken both the doses of vaccine. With another 56,813 taking the second dose on the day (Saturday), the number of fully vaccinated people has shot up to 12.58 lakh.” The official said more than 89% of the eligible population in the district had taken the first dose of vaccine so far. P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said their target was to inoculate at least 1.5 lakh people during the mega vaccination drive on Saturday. “However, only 71,166 people turned up to take the jab. We have managed to fully vaccinate at least 44% of the eligible population and we are not far away from inoculating 50% of them with both the doses.” Speaking about the elaborate arrangements for the mass vaccination drive, she said they had, for the first time, roped in religious institutions to encourage people to take the shot. “Block medical officers are provided with electoral roll to identify unvaccinated people by conducting door-to-door survey. We have also made arrangements to alert the people, who are due to take the second vaccine dose, through SMS to make use of the mega drive to get inoculated,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/71166-people-inoculated-at-1112-vaccination-camps/articleshow/87408427.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Nagpur||CBSE teachers association to hold ‘dharna’ on Monday||Nagpur: CBSE Schools’ Staff Welfare Association (CSSWA) has decided to hold a dharna on November 1 in city, to press for their demand for a state level tribual to address teachers’ problems. Deepali Dably, president of CSSWA said the ‘jan andolan’ will be held at Samvidhan Square. Dably said, “At present there is no school tribunal for CBSE Employees from all over Maharashtra constituted either by the central government or by the state. We need this for redressal of grievances of teaching as well as non-teaching staff working in these independent CBSE schools. This has resulted, shockingly, into professional exploitation of the entire staff working in such CBSE schools.” Dably said out of approximately 24,000 independent CBSE schools from all over India, there are around 1,070 private CBSE schools in Maharashtra. “They are affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), follow their syllabus, curriculum and have textbooks prescribed in accordance with CBSE and employ more than one lakh teaching and non-teaching staff. 95% of them are women,” said Dably. “Constitution of school tribunal for the entire teaching and non-teaching staff of CBSE Schools throughout Maharashtra has become the need of the hour as there is no such school tribunal anywhere in any corner of state for redressal of grievances of teaching as well as non-teaching staff,” said Dably. Addressing the media on Saturday, Dably said that starting a mass agitation movement was now the only solution. “Looking towards the seriousness of the subject mentioned above as well as for quick and effective fulfilment and implementation of professional demands of the entire CBSE employees from all over Maharashtra, we decided to conduct the Jan Andolan, as it is the need of the hour,” said Dably.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cbse-teachers-association-to-hold-dharna-on-monday/articleshow/87408428.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Ensure hawkers not harassed, says HC||New Delhi: Proper implementation of the Street Vendors Act will ensure hawkers are not harassed and don’t have to pay “hafta”, Delhi High Court said on Saturday. Starting hearings for a batch of petitions challenging the Act, its rules and scheme, the court said it wanted to go through the “jurisprudence” on the issue. “We want to achieve proper implementation of the Street Vendors Act so that vendors’ harassment goes, they don’t have to pay “Hafta” and their sites are properly demarcated. In each market, there should be kiosks set by the local authorities and corporation so that these people remain within their defined bounds and conduct their business,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked. The court’s observation came when lawyers appearing for the vendors’ association complained that only a one-sided picture was being given to the court by the traders’ association and civic agencies and that might colour the process. But the bench made it clear it was keeping an open mind and wanted to hear all parties. However, it pointed out that no one can claim a “right” to squat on public way. “When you want to use a public street impinging on others’ right of way, it can only be a license, not a right,” the court pointed out. The court also took exception to the absence of experts in the Town Vending Commitee set up under the Act. Senior advocate Sanjiv Ralli apprised the bench about the various Supreme Court and high court rulings on the issue of hawkers and vendors after which the high court said it will take up the case next month. The high court had earlier commented that the Act seemed to be lopsided and “tilted” in favour of vendors. It had also refused to modify its earlier direction to remove illegal hawkers/vendors from Connaught Place and asked the AAP government to “get down to some real work” rather than indulging in “populism.” The high court said the administration of the city cannot be held to “ransom” at the hands of street vendors and it won’t allow the “city to go to ruins”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ensure-hawkers-not-harassed-says-hc/articleshow/87411898.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Documents labelled ‘official secrets’ found on Param Bir aide’s phone?||MUMBAI: The Mumbai police has registered a fresh FIR against Sanjay Punamia, his son advocate Sunny Punamia and others of theft, criminal conspiracy under the Indian Telegraph Act and Information Technology Act after they retrieved confidential documents of the central and state governments from their cellphones. The police is likely to book them under the Official Secrets Act. The FIR is based on the complaint of assistant commissioner of police Hanif Mujawar who was heading a special investigating team (SIT) which was formed to probe the alleged extortion, cheating and forgery case registered by builder Shyam Sunder Agarwal against Punamia, IPS officer Param Bir Singh and few other policemen who were allegedly trying to extort Rs 20 crore from Agarwal by pressuring him to sign consent terms over disputed properties.  In July, the SIT arrested Punamia and his accomplice Sunil Jain in the case. The duo got bail, while Punamia is still admitted to Jupiter hospital after he tested positive for Covid. The police had then seized Punamia’s mobile phone which was sent to a forensic expert to retrieve its data suspecting that it contains WhatsApp chats and other information which could be evidence. Digital forensic experts have sent the report in which it found confidential documents of state and central governments, sources said. “On May 3, 2021, Punamia had sent a PDF file to his son Sunny of 27 pages which has few letters of the police from the home department, Maharashtra DGP, CBI New Delhi and few inquiry reports of the state Home department which are confidential and it should not have been in the hands of private persons other than government officials,” said an officer.  An official said there are also call detail reports (CDR) of three persons including Shyam Agarwal’s son’s Sharad. They said obtaining somebody’s CDR is breach of somebody’s privacy. A person’s CDR reveals number of calls s/he made and received, numbers to which calls were made or received from, date, time and duration of calls. Only security agencies can obtain that after following proper procedure. “And in this case, we strongly suspect that Punamia may have got access to this confidential documents and CDR with the help of some policemen. Now we will arrest Punamia and will have to interrogate him to know the source and if it comes to light the involvement of some government officials, we will add official secret act to the case,” said another senior officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-docus-labelled-official-secrets-found-on-param-bir-aides-phone/articleshow/87410156.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||India||Sectors vulnerable to terrorist funding, laundering under lens||NEW DELHI: A national risk assessment (NRA) is currently under way in which central agencies, including the Reserve Bank of India, have been tasked with evaluating sectors that are vulnerable to money laundering and terror financing. The exercise has begun just ahead of the India’s mutual evaluation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Paris-based inter-governmental body that had recently retained Pakistan on its ‘Grey List’ following its non-compliance in taking actions against banned terrorist outfits and UN-designated terrorists, denying them access to its financial institutions and banks. India’s own FATF assessment has been pending since 2019 and postponed twice. An internal assessment earlier had found lack of convictions in a large number of cases related to money laundering. Following this, the government had asked the ED and CBI among other agencies to file chargesheets in a time-bound manner and ensure convictions in cases where prosecution complaints have been filed. The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), an arm of the finance ministry, has been closely coordinating with all the intelligence and enforcement agencies, including the RBI, to further improve the inter-agency cooperation and boost actions against suspicious entities engaged in money laundering. The real estate and gems & jewellery sectors in particular are more prone to money laundering and have been high on the government’s agenda to prevent organised crime syndicates using its financial institutions to launder money and endanger the economy. Lakhs of shell firms have been deregistered by the government in the last few years after they were found engaged in money laundering with no real business activity involved. The department of revenue in the finance ministry is the designated department to conduct NRA on money laundering and terror financing. According to sources, India’s mutual evaluation of the FATF has been postponed to sometime around May 2022. Another area of concern for the Centre is the access of some terror outfits to international finances coming through the non-profit organisations (NPOs), particularly in the northeastern states and J&K. Last year, the CEIB had alerted banks, financial institutions and RBI-authorised money changers to keep a close watch on small deposits in dormant bank accounts and huge financial flows linked to some of these NPOs operating from these jurisdictions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sectors-vulnerable-to-terrorist-funding-laundering-under-lens/articleshow/87412485.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Chandigarh||Petrol dealers flag illegal sale of oil base, high VAT||Chandigarh: Members of Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) on Saturday warned the state government that not only were petroleum dealers facing financial losses, but government revenue had also been heavily affected by illegal sale of oil base/chemical oil/industrial grade product through mobile vans in the market in the name of biodiesel. An executive meeting of PPDA was held at Hotel Parkview, Sector 24, on Saturday, where petroleum dealers from across the state reviewed the issue and offered suggestions to the government to deal with it. Association president Sandeep Sehgal said that in the last few months, authorities concerned have raided units involved in illegal distribution of unlicensed bio-diesel in the state. It was pointed out that since biodiesel is cheaper than diesel, most vehicles have shifted to biodiesel. Oil marketing companies have also registered a massive cut in sale of high-speed diesel (HPD) and motor speed (MS) as well as high speed diesel (HPD) vehicles have shifted to the BS-6 category despite huge government investment. They said that due to the negligence of the government, low grade oil was being sold illegally to meet the demand. Sehgal also said that door-to-door delivery of fuel had been launched. He said According to OMCs, the service is valid for heavy machines or vehicles which cannot reach the petrol pump but it was seen that government and OMC orders were being flouted and fuel was being delivered to motorable, passenger and agricultural vehicles. The association urged the government to take action against non-licensed persons and establishments which buy diesel from mobile vans illegally. Expressing concern over the higher VAT rate in Punjab as compared to Chandigarh, association general secretary Rajesh Kumar said about 1,000 petrol pumps of Punjab adjoining Chandigarh and other states are on the verge of closure. He added that the expansion of petrol pumps in Punjab was much higher than the national average, so the issuance of NoC of new pumps should be stopped.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/petrol-dealers-flag-illegal-sale-of-oil-base-high-vat/articleshow/87406901.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

Last year, owing to a delayed withdrawal of monsoon the month had recorded 170.1 mm of rainfall. The all-time highest October rainfall recorded has been 376 mm in the year 1998. In 2020 the IMD declared withdrawal of the south-west monsoon over Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra on October 28. It saw the most delayed monsoon withdrawal over Mumbai since the IMD began maintaining its record in 1975. This year, withdrawal of monsoon was declared on October 14 with the month recording no heavy rain spells. The least October rainfall over the last decade has been recorded in the year 2018 — at 3.8 mm — while the most has been in 2012 — at 197.7 mm. The official date of withdrawal of the southwest monsoon for Mumbai was September 29 until 2019. With changes in weather pattern and onset and withdrawal dates, the official withdrawal date is now considered as October 8. IMD officials said that monsoon characteristics have changed over the past years. “Especially in northern parts of the country, monsoon onset is taking place late. The withdrawal too has changed and monsoon is seen staying back longer. Therefore, the month of October has been recording significant rain,” said an IMD official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-oct-rainfall-ebbs-this-yr-2nd-lowestin-a-decade/articleshow/87410176.cms||Richa Pinto

Viewers from his channel hail from nations such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, US, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Brazil, UAE, and Cambodia. Singh, 50, who has also spent many years in Bijnor, in his videos teaches farmers about various methods of farming such as trench, portray nursery, single bud, seed multiplication through tissue culture, ring pit method of sugarcane cultivation, optimal use of water, intercropping, and crop residue management. He also educates them about technologies that can help maximise production in an eco-friendly way. “The channel aims to bring together the best cultivation techniques,” he said. Talking to TOI, Singh added: "I have shared excellent, practically tested techniques. My channel has over 22.6 million viewers & 97,300 subscribers from 18 countries." "It is time for farmers to pursue innovative work to increase their income. It is difficult to make life prosperous only with the help of traditional methods. Farmers should adopt modern techniques for cultivation. I feel proud when they learn cultivation techniques to increase their income by watching my videos," he said. Singh said that he first tests his methods practically on the field. If a cultivation technique bears fruit, he uploads it on his channel. "For instance, generally, sugarcane yield is between 800 and 900 quintals per hectare. When we grow sugarcane through the trench method, it doubles the cane yield and saves the cost of production. Crops can be grown with less water and fertilisers. There is enough distance between two lines of crop. That is why farmers can practice intercrops, such as vegetables and pulses, and earn more," he explained.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/up-cane-officers-youtube-channel-for-farmers-draws-22-6-mn-viewers-from-18-nations/articleshow/87406892.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Huzurabad voters poll fearlessly amid tight security||HUZURABAD: Under the watchful eyes of thousands of gun-toting security personnel, Huzurabad electorate cast their votes in the by-election on Saturday. It was like the constituency was taken over by para military and police, whose presence was found not just near polling booths but in all sensitive places. The polling was by and large peaceful, but tension was palpable right from the word go. For the last five months or so, an election atmosphere prevailed in the constituency after Eatala Rajendar had resigned from TRS. He was fielded by BJP as its candidate, while TRS chose Gellu Srinvas Yadav, TRSV leader, as its nominee. Congress fielded Venkat Balmoor for the election. Though poll percentage was low in the first two hours, giving anxious moments to all political parties, it picked up as the day progressed and clocked over 80% at the end of the polling day. “I am told that my old voter ID will not suffice as identity to cast my vote though I also have a voter slip,” a voter at Zilla Parishad High School at Kamlapur said, as he rushed out around 4.30pm to get another identity card, may be his Aadhaar card, which would enable him to cast his vote. While during morning, most polling booths were practically empty with voters taking less than five minutes to cast their votes, towards afternoon the rush increased. In one of the schools at Kamalapur, there was a huge crowd of voters in the evening waiting for their turn to cast their vote. “I had no problem as I had my baby with me. They allowed me inside without making me wait,” a woman said. While in the last few weeks, there was palpable tension because of how TRS and BJP candidates had pitted themselves against each other, the heavy police force seemed to have given a signal to the voters to freely exercise their franchise. At Gellu Srinivas Yadav’s house at Himmatnagar, there was a festive atmosphere as if the candidate had already won. “There is no doubt. I am 100% sure of my victory,” Srinivas Yadav said. At Eatala Rajendar’s house, everyone was at ease. “Eatala has goodwill among the public. That is what will help him sail through,” professor Sambaiah, who taught Eatala when he was in school, said. Reacting to criticism of wearing a dark pink ‘kandwa’, TRS’ Srinivas Yadav said it did not reflect the party colour or have any party symbol. “I have been wearing it for more than 20 years,” he said. Karimnagar collector and district election officer RV Karnan told TOI that there were some stray incidents, but there was no law and order situation as such.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/voters-poll-fearlessly-amid-tight-security/articleshow/87408473.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Advising caution, experts and doctors said men should be careful and be wary about their outdoor movements. A verification by TOI across government and commercial institutions revealed that over 99 per cent of cases are now vaccine breakthrough infections, with men accounting for 70 per cent of those affected. A vaccine breakthrough infection happens when a fully vaccinated person gets infected with Covid-19. People with vaccine breakthrough infections tend to spread the virus to others. According to Dr Y Sridhar, critical care specialist at Apollo Hospitals, the incidence is higher in men in general, but the percentage of breakthrough infections has increased. “It is now 70:10 when compared to Covid-19 cases in non-vaccinated population. The intensity of the infection has always been high in men and they need to be cautious,” he said. Men with comorbidities have to be vigilant about their movements, he added. Experts have also identified research that relates greater incidence of breakthrough infections in men. Dr Kiran Madala, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher, said Public Health England’s findings state that 60 per cent of breakthrough infections occur in men. “It could be due to a variety of factors, including how well antibodies react and function in the body, as well as immunity levels,” he said. The antibodies vanish early in the elderly people, so men who were vaccinated and aged above 60 with comorbidities should be more careful, he suggested. However, the most typical cause is that men, as opposed to women, are more careless with Covid-19 protocol, including wearing masks. “Men move outdoors more than wome, and most people have the common misconception that vaccination protects them against infection, but vaccine protects against mortality,” said Dr Kishan Rao, head of the Telangana Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association. Experts also warned that people who get vaccine breakthrough infections could be contagious.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/incidence-of-breakthrough-infections-high-among-men/articleshow/87408469.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

"We will observe Diwali at the (Delhi-UP) border. It is going to be a 'black' Diwali for farmers," he added. On the recent talk of removal of barricades from the Ghazipur border, Tikait said, "Barricades are not going anywhere. It is all a lie. The movement is still going on." Taking a swipe at the ruling BJP, Tikait said, "We will provide medicine to BJP in the upcoming assembly polls as we had earlier done in West Bengal. It is a dangerous party. We will canvass against BJP if they don't listen to us. We are not with any political party, but against the BJP." Speaking at the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) sponsored 'mahapanchayat' at Joya in Amroha district, Tikait raised farmer's grievances and other pressing issues. The BKU leader said, "Farmers and youngsters of India are both ruined. Prices for crops have not been hiked. Sugarcane dues are still pending. Unseasonal rainfall has destroyed paddy, vegetables, mustard and many other crops. In addition, young people are jobless." Tikait also questioned the RSS and asked, "Is it necessary to have a RSS certificate to be a Hindu in this country? There are two types of Hindus in India. Rakesh Tikait calls himself a Hindu without a certificate." On Shahrukh Khan's son Aryan Khan's case, the farm union leader said no action has been taken against those who are bringing illegal substances in large quantities into the country. A purported audio of "farmers from America" was also played out in front of the large gathering during the 'mahapanchayat'. "Now, America's farmers are also standing with us," Tikait claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/will-observe-diwali-at-delhi-border-says-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/87406923.cms||Harveer Dabas

The Delhi government told Justice Rekha Palli that based on the 2011 census, the Centre has set a limit of 72 lakh ration cards, which stands exhausted and, therefore, it cannot be faulted for not having issued a ration card to the daily wager. The court was hearing the petition by the daily-wage worker seeking a ration card in a time-bound manner, with the names of all her family members. Earlier this month, the court had sought the Delhi government’s stand on why the application for issuance of a ration card by a daily-wage worker was pending for eight years. “On the last date, Mr. (Gautam) Narayan, learned counsel for respondent nos. 2 to 4 was granted time to obtain instructions. Today, he submits that no ration card could be issued to the petitioner as the limit for issuance of 72 lakh ration cards set by respondent no. 1, based on the Census of 2011, already stands exhausted and, therefore, the respondents nos. 2 to 4 cannot be faulted for not having issued a ration card to the petitioner,” the judge noted in her order dated October 25. “In the light of the stand taken by the respondents nos. 2 to 4 i.e. the Government of NCT of Delhi, it is deemed necessary to have the stand of the respondent no.1, i.e. the Union of India as well,” the order said. pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-seeks-centre-stand-on-plea-for-ration-card/articleshow/87411912.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Second non-bailable warrant against former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The 37th metropolitan magistrate S B Bhajipale on Saturday issued a non-bailable warrant against IPS officer Param Bir Singh and two other accused — Vinay Singh and Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhatti — in a case of alleged extortion where the accused threatened a hotelier and extorted money from him. The court also dismissed API Sachin Waze’s application seeking stay on production of a warrant against him. This is the second non bailable warrant being issued against Param Bir Singh. Three summons were issued but the trio failed to present themselves before the crime branch. Bhatti, who has criminal cases against him, had gone underground after the sessions court rejected his anticipatory bail last month. Earlier he was caught by the city police for procuring on a forged passport and using it to travel. The non-bailable warrant will pave the way to declare him an ‘absconder’. The court also rejected Waze’s application to stay the production warrant against him. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had on Thursday granted permission to the city crime branch to take Waze’s custody in the case of alleged extortion. Waze, who was arrested in planting of gelatine sticks and Mansukh Hiran’s murder case, last month underwent heart bypass surgery and now the medical team report had given them the green signal to take his custody from Taloja jail. The case pertains to businessman Bimal Agarwal’s complaint that Waze, at Singh’s behest, extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on his two restaurants and bars in Goregaon which Agarwal ran in partnership. Agarwalstated that Waze also forcibly extorted two high-end cellphones worth Rs 2.92 lakh from him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-2nd-non-bailable-warrant-against-param-bir-singh/articleshow/87410190.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||Indecisive Congress makes Modi stronger, can’t be taken seriously: Mamata Banerjee||PANAJI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP will grow stronger as a political force as long as Congress remains indecisive and displays a lack of seriousness, said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in Goa, on Saturday. Addressing party supporters and reporters, the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo said Congress had squandered several opportunities to take on BJP because of which the country is suffering. “I cannot say everything right now, but it (Congress) didn’t take things seriously in politics. Modi is going to be more powerful because of Congress,” said Banerjee when asked if TMC remains open to an alliance with the party. Though TMC had responded to Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s overtures to like-minded parties, Banerjee appeared to rue the lack of quick decision-making by the principal opposition party. Banerjee has announced that her party has set its eyes on contesting the state assembly elections in Tripura, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Goa ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections. The West Bengal-based outfit is trying to increase its national footprint as it looks to take on BJP at the national level. “If one cannot take a decision, why should the country suffer for that? They have got enough opportunity,” said Banerjee. “We want that all the people who are committed to fight against BJP — the regional parties, the local parties — I welcome them to work with us. Regional parties are the strong parties.” She appears to be in no mood to forgive Congress for contesting against her in the West Bengal elections. “Instead of contesting against BJP, they have contested against me in my state. Why did they contest against my party in West Bengal? What do they expect? That they will contest against me and I will give them two flowers?” said Banerjee. She said that while she does not want the anti-BJP vote to be divided, at the same time, she does not want to wait for Congress to get its act together. “I don’t want the vote to be divided for those who are really fighting against BJP. But the problem is with the national parties. That is why whenever the opportunity comes, the request comes, we will go. Wherever the possibility, we will go,” said Banerjee. “We discussed with GFP to work together. It is now their decision, their choice,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/indecisive-cong-makes-modi-stronger-cant-be-taken-seriously-didi/articleshow/87411241.cms||---

Pithani was arrested in May. This was his second attempt to seek bail. Special public prosecutor Advait M Sethna opposed the bail plea and said despite the fact that the defence had sought bail on grounds of parity as other accused were released by the court, the plea was rejected. He also argued Section 27A of the NDPS Act for illicit trafficking and harbouring of offenders was attracted in the case. Pithani, in his bail plea, had contended that as the chargesheet was not submitted within 60 days of his arrest, he was entitled to bail. However, it was contended that considering the stringent sections applied in the case, the chargesheet has to be filed within 180 days. In June, the court had granted him interim bail as his wedding was scheduled on June 26 in Hyderabad. Pithani had submitted a copy of the wedding invite in court. The court granted him interim bail until July 2.

Union home minister Amit Shah inaugurated the project and called it a "proud moment" for the state. Congratulating the state's cooperative team, Shah, who is also the cooperation minister, said, “It ends the possibility of any kind of corruption and will help the government in transferring the amount into the accounts of farmers and other beneficiaries.” The Centre is also planning computerisation across the country in all the MPACS, he added. “I will send a team from Delhi to study the Uttarakhand model,” Shah said. The minister pointed out that the Congress had made the cooperative structure weak. “In the past seven decades no one thought about a separate ministry for cooperation. PM Modi created this ministry and I got the honour to become its first minister,” he added. Shah also inaugurated the CM Ghasyari Yojna. The yojna aims to provide relief to women living in the hills and travelling long distances to collect leaves for cows and goats. Under the ambitious project, the locals would get quality fodder at low rates. Over 1,000 farmers are also encouraged to grow maize to help prepare the Total Mixed Animal Ration. “I'm aware of the hardships faced by women living in the hills in bringing food for cows and goats.

The court upheld the contentions of the petitioners that the principles of natural justice had been violated and they had not been issued a notice nor hearing before the order was passed. “There can be no doubt about the position of law that, if an order adverse to the interest of a party is to be issued, the affected party has to be issued a notice and granted proper hearing before any such order is passed,” the high court stated. The petitioners pointed out that apart from the adverse effect of the petitioners being removed from the managing committee, there is a serious civil consequence where they would be barred from re-election before completing nine years from such a dissolution. “This court is of the opinion that considering the serious consequences that are faced by the petitioners, the impugned communication and order cannot be sustained only on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice,” Justice Manish Pitale stated. “If the respondent nos. 1 to 3 intend to take any action against the petitioners, proper notice and effective hearing shall be granted to the petitioners before any order is passed,” the court added. The petitioners Joao Rosario Fernandes and two others challenged the communication dated August 10, 2021 issued by the under secretary (Revenue-I) whereby the president and attorney of the managing committee of Comunidade of Fraternal de Aldona were dismissed under Article 74 of the Code of Comunidades and the Administrator of the Code of Comunidades of North Zone was directed to look after the administration.

A temperature check was must for voters. Masks were given away, sanitisers were made available and most of all plastic gloves for one hand were important. After casting their vote, the voters had to dispose of the gloves in the baskets provided for the purpose. At all the polling booths, medicines were also made available, in case anyone needed to be given if they were running a temperature. However, they were also to come back to vote only if they had a Covid-19 negative report. During the early hours, the circles drawn for voters to maintain social distance served their purpose but once the rush increased, the social distancing norm went for a toss at several polling booths. It needed effort on the part of the police and staff to ask them to maintain social distancing. With the hot sun blazing, the authorities got shamianas (tents) erected and this served the purpose to some extent but in most places lack of such a facility left many standing in the hot sun waiting for their turn to cast their vote. The ‘health camp’ booths that were set up provided medication to those who needed it. “A person had a temperature. We gave him a tablet and asked him to return after three hours if he felt alright,” a health staff told TOI at one of the polling booths. Karimnagar additional collector Garima Agarwal said that efforts were made to provide a safe environment for voters. “We allowed them if they had a negative report, so that they are not dissuaded from participating in the election process,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/officials-take-steps-to-keep-covid-at-bay/articleshow/87408504.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The victim was admitted to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) with stab injuries to his forehead and abdomen. The Ramanathapuram police identified the accused as 21-year-old N Prasanna and 29-year-old A Sudharsan alias Sait, both residents of Ramanathapuram, and 21-year-old N Morris, a resident of Nanjundapuram. A police officer said the three were daily wage labourers. “Under the influence of alcohol, the trio had approached their friend Anto, 21, of Ramanathapuram, for money to buy liquor. When Anto refused them money, they fought with him. Anto immediately called up his close friend P Vinodh, 21, of Veerappa Thevar Colony, and the latter contacted Prasanna and questioned him for fighting with his friend,” the officer said. Around 10.30pm, the officer said, the trio went to the house of Vinodh. “As they were speaking with his mother, Vinodh came out of the house and they assaulted him using a knife and sickle in front of his mother. When neighbours rushed to the spot on hearing the commotion, the trio managed to escape from the place.” Vinodh was immediately rushed to CMCH, where his condition is said to be stable. Based on Vinodh’s complaint, the Ramanathapuram police registered a case against the trio under Sections 294(b), 323, 307 and 506 (ii) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested them on Saturday.

---||Ahmedabad||A ‘perfect sibling’ for thalassemia child||Ahmedabad: Viramdevsinh Chudasama and his wife Jayshreeba are pregnant with their second child and hope that the sibling will become the panacea for getting their elder son Jaiveer getting cured of thalassemia. While the couple can conceive naturally, they specially underwent IVF treatment with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to ensure that the second child is thalassemia free and a 100% human leukocyte antigens (HLA) match to donate bone marrow to the brother to cure him of the debilitating blood disorder which makes him sick every few weeks. Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder caused when the body doesn’t make enough haemoglobin and the patient has to undergo regular blood transfusions for survival. “Six-year-old son has undergone 84 transfusions so far. Through some couples who have thalassemic children, we got to know that technology can help us conceive and deliver a sibling which is a perfect match for our son’s transplant. We wanted a second child and if he or she can be our elder son’s saviour, there is nothing more we could ask for,” says Viramdevsinh Chudasama. The Chudasama couple is one of the three couples who opted to undergo IVF treatment with pre-genetic diagnosis at Bavishi Fertility Institute and have either become or are expecting to become parents of a child which is a perfect match for the thalassemic sibling. “Two couples have already delivered babies who are 100% HLA match for the sibling and their bone marrow and even cord blood stem cells will be used in future for transplant to cure elder siblings of thalassemia. As awareness about technology increases, more couples struggling with thalassemia children are opting for this process,” said fertility specialist Dr Falguni Bavishi. Another Vadodara-based couple who have a thalassemic major daughter recently delivered a baby girl who is 100% match for transplant for the sister. “Doctors have said transplant would be possible when the child is 12kg. We are praying for the sister's bone marrow to work miracles and cure the elder child,” said the couple requesting anonymity. “This technique will have a far-reaching impact on society as thalassemia-affected children, who live with severely compromised health, can look forward to leading a healthy normal life,” added Dr Bavishi.Dr Salil Vaniawala, the medical geneticist who did PGD testing for all three couples, said that so far some 15 couples have approached him through fertility specialists for genetic screening of embryos. “First, the embryos are screened for thalassemia major. Those embryos which are normal are then tested for HLA match with the elder sibling. Embryos which are a match are implanted to result in a pregnancy,” said Dr Vaniawala. Apart from regular blood transfusions, the only treatment for thalassemia is a bone marrow transplant from an HLA-matching donor. If the donor is a sibling or parent, the chances of HLA matching are good, but not 100%.“Opting for PGD-IVF is an additional cost but a growing number of parents are going for it to ensure high chances of curing their child of thalassemia,” said Dr Sandeep Shah, senior hemato-oncologist and transplant physician.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/a-perfect-sibling-for-thalassemia-child/articleshow/87408506.cms||---

The stolen cash and gold were found hidden at four different locations — two places in Beed, and one each in Majalgaon and Gevrai. The police teams from Jalna and Beed districts carried out a joint operation and successfully solved the case. Jalna superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh said, “Preliminary probe has revealed that the accused are friends. None of them is a habitual offender. They come from three different professions and decided to commit the robbery to come out of financial crisis and pay off their debts.” One of the arrested accused os Muqeed, alias Mustafa Kasam, of Gevrai in Beed. He is a furniture trader by profession. The second man is Sandeep Solunke, a waiter hailing from Majalgaon, also in the Beed district. A manhunt has been launched for their accomplice. The robbery by the three masked men — committed in a span of seven minutes — took place at the Buldhana urban cooperative bank’s Shahgad branch situated on the Solapur-Dhule National Highway on Thursday. The accused trio had barged into the bank and taken about Rs 24 lakh in cash and gold ornaments worth over Rs 3.5 crore in just seven minutes. They then fled the scene. Accordingly, a case of armed robbery was registered at the Gondi police station of Jalna district. As the accused had headed towards Beed district, the Beed police too formed teams and started the probe. When contacted, Beed’s Gevrai sub-divisional police officer Swapnil Rathod said, “It was while our teams were probing the case, that assistant inspector Kale, through his source, learned that one of the accused had brought a gunny bag full of cash. The police team then nabbed the key suspect and found crucial evidence of his involvement. Jalna police’s assistant superintendent of police Vikrant Deshmukh and Gondi police station inspector Sheetalkumar Ballal said after facing a serious financial crisis during the lockdown period, the accused men had been preparing to rob the bank’s cash-carrying van . However, they feared that such an operation could lead to a bloodbath. So they gave up that plan and decided to rob the bank instead. “The accused wanted a cakewalk, so they identified and targetted this bank, which, according to them, had very submissive employees,” said Ballal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/jalna-bank-heist-2-held-cash-gold-worth-rs-3-5cr-recovered/articleshow/87404089.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Dehradun||Ready for open debate with Amit Shah, says Harish Rawat||Dehradun: In response to the Union home minister Amit Shah's challenge for a debate on development in Uttarakhand at a public rally on Saturday, former chief minister Harish Rawat said he was ready for an “open debate on any channel or chauraha". "The entire team of Shah is free to accompany him, but I am confident that he will end up on the losing side,” the Congress leader added while dismissing all the allegations levelled by Shah against his party. On Shah's "namaz" comment, the Congress leader said, “Shah is a Union home minister and he has three CMs – a non-performer, a night watchman and a pinch hitter. He can use the entire machinery to dig out the file where I had passed the order for a holiday on Friday or allow namaz on the road. This shows that all issues mentioned by Shah were baseless and aimed only to mislead people.” During his Saturday's speech at Bannu ground, Shah had also advised Rawat to watch his sting video which had emerged in 2016. Commenting on that, he said, “This was not the only video, several videos had cropped up in five years and I would like to request Shah to publicly watch the sting videos involving me and also his own party leaders and thereafter arrive at any conclusion." Rawat expressed surprise for being targeted over the sale of a liquor brand in his tenure. “I can update Shah on how many people died at Bhagwanpur and Kashipur due to consumption of spurious liquor during their rule,” he said. The ex-CM also pointed out how the rising prices of petrol, LPG cylinder and cooking oil during the BJP rule had caused severe hardships to the common man.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ready-for-open-debate-with-amit-shah-says-harish-rawat/articleshow/87406940.cms||Kautilya Singh

Both of them said they were not influenced by any individual in their decision to cast their vote for a particular party. “I was very excited that I have been able to cast my vote. I have done my job. Now it is left to the person who gets elected to deliver and do a good job as a public representative,” Aqsana said. Though this was the first time she voted, she was eligible during the 2018 election itself but her name was not enrolled then in the voter list. “I was also equally excited. I was glad when I found my name in the voters’ list and I exercised my franchise. It feels great,” Ruqsana said. At a polling booth, a youngster stood in queue waiting for his turn to vote. “I have been away from home and came straight to the polling booth to vote. My parents neither knew that I had come here nor did they tell me who to vote for,” he said. “Of 20 friends that I have, nearly 10 had the right to vote. We did discuss how best to use our right to vote,” he said. A woman came along with her daughter to another polling booth. The girl was hesitant to talk but her mother said her daughter had made up her mind. “She keeps track of political developments, follows what politicians say. She voted according to her conscience,” the mother said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/first-timers-vote-by-conscience/articleshow/87408521.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The district probation officer, one stop centre manager, cops of local police station and relatives of the three were the witnesses of this marriage which took place at the Asha Jyoti Centre located at Gol Chauraha on Friday. Pankaj Sharma, a resident of Barra-8, who works as an accountant in a private firm in Gurugram, had married Komal of Bhaunti Sachendi area of the city on May 2, 2021. The wedding was solemnised as per the rituals. Pankaj told reporters that his wife Komal used to maintain distance from him since the day one of their marriage. "She neither consummated the marriage nor even talked to anyone. After being coaxed, she confided hat she wanted to marry her lover Pitu," Pankaj said. When Pankaj told his in-laws, they tried to convince Komal but she remained adamant to her decision. The matter then reached the Anti-Domestic Violence Cell and Asha Jyoti Centre located at Gol Chauraha. In-charge of Anti-Domestic Violence Cell and Asha Jyoti Centre, Nidhi Gupta then arranged a meeting in which the woman, her husband, her boyfriend and their relatives were present. The woman in the meeting revealed that she loves her boyfriend and wants to stay with him. She requested the Anti-Domestic Violence Cell and the Asha Jyoti Centre to allow them to marry and live as husband and wife. Seeing the turn of events, Pankaj agreed and planned their marriage. He also arranged a lawyer to solemnise the marriage of his wife to her lover Pintu on Friday evening which was attended by the relatives and guests from both the sides. Locals said, "We have witnessed such a script in Bollywood movies but never in real life. Pankaj has done something extraordinary. Incidents like this are quite rare. No one will ever forget the sacrifice of Pankaj for long."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/man-sacrifices-his-marriage-weds-his-wife-to-her-boyfriend/articleshow/87410217.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Hyderabad||Telangana Congress unlikely to retain 34% vote share, say analysts||HYDERABAD: Though Telangana Congress working president T Jagga Reddy exuded confidence that party candidate Balmoor Venkat will win the Huzurabad bypoll riding on the campaign of TPCC president A Revanth Reddy, political analysts said the biggest challenge for Congress was to retain its 34 per cent vote share registered in 2018 assembly polls. P Kaushik Reddy, who was in Congress then, had polled over 61,000 votes. Kaushik is now with TRS. It was a straight contest between TRS and Congress in 2018. Going by the polling trend on Saturday, analysts said the contest was mainly between the TRS and BJP. They said it would be difficult for Congress to retain its 2018 vote tally for various reasons. Firstly, its 2018 candidate Kaushik was poached by the TRS and then Congress fielded its candidate at the last moment when TRS and BJP had already completed four months of campaigning. Political analyst and social activist Ch Rekha Rao told TOI that it was a “Mahabharata between BJP candidate Eatala Rajender and TRS nominee Gellu Srinivas Yadav and that the TRS will emerge victorious in the war. Congress could be relegated to a distant third position and may struggle to maintain its 2018 vote share.” The party is banking on the good turnout of students and unemployed youth who cast their vote in the bypoll to Huzurabad Assembly constituency on Saturday, to give it a respectable number of votes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/congress-unlikely-to-retain-34-vote-share-say-analysts/articleshow/87408542.cms||Roushan Ali

Congress senior leader and former MP Sircilla Rajaiah and spokesperson Ayodhya Reddy alleged that the two ruling parties have turned the bypoll into a ‘vote-buying election’ with money, muscle and liquor power, thereby setting a bad precedent of spending huge money in elections. Rajaiah said in such circumstances the responsibility fell on the shoulders of the people of Huzurabad constituency to save democracy. “Top officials of the Election Commission in Telangana and Huzurabad should resign on moral grounds,” Rajaiah said. The Congress leaders said CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be blamed for what had happened in Huzurabad constituency. “Everyone knows that Eatala Rajender joined BJP to protect himself and his properties from the onslaught of KCR and not to protect democracy. What has happened in Huzurabad should be taken as an example to bring sweeping changes such as conducting voting in online mode by making necessary amendments in the Constitution,” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-murdered-democracy-cong/articleshow/87408528.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Sai Baba Officers’ Colony consists of close to 1,000 residents spread over 200 plots. A few months back, the RWA members had taken an initiative to develop their own compost in 30 open plots. “We had asked all our residents to collect and segregate their kitchen waste and give it to us to convert it into an organic compost. Now, after three to four months, we are distributing the compost to our residents as a Diwali gift. The idea is to encourage gardening, especially terrace gardening among our residents,” said Chandra Shekhar, president of Sai Baba Officers Colony Residents Welfare Association. The initiative has garnered massive response among residents. “We will provide compost manure as well as a sapling to all the residents to promote greenery in our colony. We want to make it a fertilizer-free colony,” said Sudesh Kumar, a resident. Many other neighbouring colonies are now reaching out to the Sai Baba Officers’ Colony RWA to emulate their idea.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sainikpuri-rwa-gets-creative-to-gift-compost/articleshow/87408526.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Gangster planning to kill rival held||Mohali: Police on Saturday claimed to have foiled a murder plan with the arrest of a gangster and recovering three pistols and 73 cartridges. SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said the accused is Rajneesh Kumar alias Preet Phagwara, a resident of Phagwara. He is a close aide of gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria. He was involved in murder, robbery, gun running and drug smuggling cases in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh. A total of 24 FIRs had been registered against him. The SSP said the police had brought Phagwara on production warrant to from a Punjab jail to investigate snatching incidents that had taken place under the jurisdiction of Kurali police station. The SSP said Phagwara revealed he was planning to kill his rival gang member Sukhi Bidhipuria lodged in jail during his next court hearing. Phagwara was in touch with his associates and had arranged weapons and ammunition to execute the plan. The SSP said pistols and ammunition arranged from other states were recovered on the disclosures of Phagwara. A case under section 25 of the Arms Act was registered at the city Kurali police station. The SSP said Phagwara had entered the world of crime in 2014. In the beginning, he was a member of Sukha Kahlwan group and used to operate the gangster’s Facebook profile. After Kahlwan’s killing, he joined the gang of Jaggu Bhagwanpuria. On the directions of Bhagwanpuria, he and his associates connived with Akul Khattri, an associate of Bhagwanpuria, to escape from police custody during a court hearing in Nawanshahr. After that, he arranged his associates to carry out an attack on Beant Brar, a resident of Baghapurana. Further investigation in this case is underway, the SSP said.

---||Goa||HC stays collector’s memo on nod for land conversions||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has stayed clause 2 (iii) of the North Goa collector’s office memorandum dated June 18, 2021 which has the effect of permitting conversion of lands with natural vegetation in Goa without having to go to the forest department. The petitioner Goa Foundation submitted to the court that clause 2 (iii) in the office memorandum dispenses with the requirement of sending applications for conversion of land having area less than one hectare to the forest department and which can instead be sent to the collector. The memorandum is unwarranted and nothing but an attempt to bypass orders of the Supreme Court and high court, Goa Foundation submitted. The division bench comprising Justices Revati Mohite Dere and M S Jawalkar, while staying the clause of the office memorandum, recorded a statement made on behalf of the respondents that till the next date no trees will be cut by Ashver Project Management LLP, Aditi Mody Family Pvt Ltd, Anjali Mody Family Pvt Ltd and Aarti Pandit Family Pvt Ltd who Goa Foundation made as respondents in the petition. Counsel representing Goa Foundation Anamika Gode submitted that it is only the forest department that has the necessary expertise to consider the natural vegetation in Goa with tree canopy density and sought quashing of clause 2(iii) of the memorandum. Goa Foundation stated that the Supreme Court order does not make any exceptions as far as permitting the conversation of subdivided plots with area less than one hectare are concerned. If a plot of five hectare area having natural vegetation with tree canopy density in excess of 0.1 is subdivided into ten small plots of 0.5 hectare area each, and NOC/conversion sanads are granted by the relevant authorities in respect of such plots, this amounts to blatant contravention of the Supreme Court’s order dated February 4, 2015 as the exercise leads to the cumulative conversion of the entire plot of land which is prohibited from being converted per the apex court order, Goa Foundation stated. “Further, it is not known how a non-expert like the collector can decide on matters like number of trees, forestry species or canopy density. The land survey data provided in Schedule II is often erroneous and is often known to devalue vegetation since no forest official is involved in the enumeration,” Goa Foundation stated in its petition. “An earlier circular which also did not require reference to the forest department for conversion proposals was withdrawn after a challenge from the present petitioner and objections filed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,” Goa Foundation added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-stays-collectors-memo-on-nod-for-land-conversions/articleshow/87410211.cms||---

One of the arrested women includes the child’s mother. The accused gynaecologist, Dr Pankaj Patil, owns The Family Health Care hospital in sector 8 of Kamothe, while the other accused are the infant’s mother, Amreen Bano Badar Baksh (31), and two mediators, Rajni Jadhav (32) and Rukhsar Shaikh (29). While Rajni works as a helper nurse at Dr Patil’s clinic, Rukhsar is an egg donor for IVF treatment there. Smita Jadhav, senior inspector at Kamothe police station, said they acted on a tip-off from a social worker that the doctor was going to sell an infant girl at his hospital for Rs 4 lakh on Thursday evening. A trap was laid and a woman constable, Manthan Patil (38), was sent as a decoy. She was accompanied by a social worker. Manthan pretended that she wanted to buy the baby, as she was unable to conceive a child. Dr Patil accepted Rs 4 lakh, contacted the infant’s mother and asked her to bring the child. The mother, Amreen, who is a housewife residing in Taloja, arrived at the clinic along with the two mediators. Once Dr Patil kept the money in a handbag in his desk drawer and Amreen handed over the baby, the decoy signalled the police team waiting outside the clinic. They raided the clinic and arrested the four accused and confiscated Rs 4 lakh cash from Dr Patil’s cabin. The senior inspector said, “Amreen claimed she was selling her two-month-old as this was her fifth child, and she already had three sons and a daughter. She claimed she was unable to take care of the child due to a financial crisis, since her husband abandoned her when she got pregnant for the fifth time. She had even attempted to abort the child at a hospital in Mumbai, but the doctor refused medical termination of pregnancy as she had crossed 20 weeks.” The cop further said that of the Rs 4 lakh, Dr Patil was to take Rs 2.5 lakh. The two mediators were to be paid Rs 25,000 each as their commission, and the remaining Rs 1 lakh was for the infant’s mother Amreen. The Vashi judicial magistrate first class court remanded the four accused to police custody till November 3. Cops are investigating whether Dr Patil has committed similar crimes in the past.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-cops-arrest-doc-mum-for-selling-baby-for-rs-rs-4l/articleshow/87410231.cms||George Mendonca
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt to stop allotting city space for polluting units||AHMEDABAD: For the first time, a thorough guideline to strike off provisions for chemical plants in development plans and town planning schemes of eight municipal corporations and 156 nagarpalikas will be released by the state urban development department, a few weeks after Diwali. The state's urban development department has already requested from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) a list of chemical unit types, to be included in the new upcoming guidelines. These units should be producing hazardous chemicals, disposing of toxic waste, or having chimneys that vent dangerous industrial gases. Back in July last year, the Vijay Rupani government had initiated discussions in this direction. “Incentives in terms of taxes and exemptions will be provided to existing industries to shift to new designated locations outside the city. New development plans and TP schemes will ensure that no listed hazardous or units that can potentially pollute or violate provisions of Water Act, 1974; Air Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 be present within the city,” said a well-placed source in the state urban development department. ‘Today industries have been operating right in the middle of cities, which adversely affects pollution control measures and overall public health,” adds the official. “We have proposed an amendment in the existing town planning act to help us issue the guidelines for new DPs. To existing industries that are located within the centre of the city, we are in talks with the revenue, law, industries and mines and finance departments to chalk out lucrative incentives to polluting industries to shift outside cities,” says a senior urban development department official. Availability of land in city limits will also help government agencies, as lesser expenditure will be incurred. These plots of land can also be used profitably for making affordable housing and commercial complexes in key areas,” the source said. Top officials in the urban development department, meanwhile, said, “The concept of Green Floor Space Index (GFSI) could be introduced to incentivize energy efficient projects and a mechanism will be evolved for availing benefits of silver, gold and platinum rated categories. This may help further in reducing pollution in all major cities of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-to-stop-allotting-city-space-for-polluting-units/articleshow/87408564.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Dehradun||In Cong tenure, people had permit to block nat’l highway for namaz: Shah||Dehradun: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused the Congress of “appeasement politics”, claiming that when he visited Uttarakhand earlier during the party’s tenure, “people had permission to block a national highway for namaz”. Kicking off the BJP’s campaign in poll-bound Uttarakhand at a public rally in Dehradun, Shah said, “When I came to Uttarakhandearlier, during the Congress tenure, my convoy was stuck in a traffic jam and some people told me that there is permission to block a national highway for namaz on Friday.” The Union minister — who is on his second visit to Uttarakhand in less than 10 days — also alleged that the Congress government did not carry out restoration works at Kedarnath “for fear of losing its vote bank”. He said: “Congress is synonymous with corruption, scam and appeasement. It can neither work for the poor nor give good administration. The party has always failed to fulfill promises made to people...BJP had fulfilled 85% of the promises in its manifesto since 2017...In this period, works worth Rs 85,000 crore have been started in Uttarakhand”. Shah challenged former Uttarakhand chief minister and Congress campaign committee chairman in the state Harish Rawat to an open debate. “I will send members of our youth wing for the debate. He (Rawat) needs to tell what was the contribution of the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government in the welfare of Uttarakhand for a period of 10 years,” said Shah. Rawat had recently sought to be relieved as the in-charge of party affairs in Punjab to focus on Uttarakhand where he claimed the party was heading towards a “definite win”. In a scathing attack on Rawat, Shah said the Congress leader should “watch his sting video from 2016 again”. In 2016, Rawat was chief minister of the state when a news channel released a sting video in which he is purportedly seen negotiating "bribes" to win the support of some rebel Congress MLAs in the house for a trust vote scheduled later. Lauding the efforts of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, the Union minister said that the CM has played a commendable role in relief and rescue operations following the recent rains in Uttarakhand. Shah pointed out that PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Kedarnath on November 5. “He will inaugurate the statue of Adi Shankaracharya during his visit to the shrine,” he added. Later in the day, Shah held a core-committee meeting of the BJP at the party headquarters. In the evening, he left for Haridwar where he attended the golden jubilee celebrations of Shanti Kunj Ashram and held a closed-door meeting with Juna akhara’s acharya mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri. Sources said the meeting was also attended by yoga guru Ramdevand Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha president Swami Paramatmanand Saraswat. The Union minister said the BJP had rolled out the New Education Policy, allowing students to learn in their mother tongue and added that “PM Narendra Modi's look during his visit to Varanasi’s Vishwanath temple in 2014 with tripund tilak (three lined) and uttariya (scarf) heralded a change in the society.” Shah rued that a number of people who sacrificed themselves for the sake of India's independence had been forgotten. “In the 75th year of our independence, let us publish a book cherishing their memory so that their lives inspire our future generations. We should also resolve to make India the leader of the world by the time it completes 100 years of its Independence,” Shah said.

Apart from SP, all other parties have laid down their arms before BJP, Patel said while addressing a rally on KP College ground here. He claimed that popularity of SP chief and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has increased manifold and people were missing the “progressive regime of the SP government”. He, however, cautioned the party’s booth workers to keep an eye on voter revision list, anticipating that anomalies could be conducted at the behest of the ruling party.

---||Aurangabad||Woman cops get investigation training, reduce case pendency||Aurangabad: The move of the Aurangabad range police to train more constables, especially the woman personnel, has paid off by reducing the number of pending cases. The initiative over the last one year has resulted in the four police units of Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad having the least pendancy in the state. Aurangabad range’s special inspector-general of police K M Mallikarjuna Prasanna told TOI, “Traditionally, the woman constables were given general duties for reasons yet to be known. We experimented by asking the woman constables willing to work as investigating officers to come forward voluntarily and investigate cases. The results they delivered are remarkable.” Citing a series of examples, the officer said that in most of the cases, the newly-appointed woman investigation officers have outperformed their male colleagues in terms of quality as well as quantity of cases in a given time frame. The range had a total of 1,189 investigation officers, including 100 women, from amongst the constabulary for probing cases ranging from accidental deaths, suicides, road accidents, to petty thefts to voluntarily causing hurt. On an average, the four police units register about 35,000 cases each year and out of these cases, about 15% are serious in nature, requiring appointment of investigation officers of the rank of a PSI or above. By taking up the initiative to train more constables to become investigating officers, Aurangabad range has added over 400 such officers including close to 100 woman IOs, taking the total strength of IOs in the range to over 1,600. Till the month of September this year, 25,809 cases were registered. With the help of increased number of investigation officers, the four units have already filed over 15,000 chargesheets, over 1,300 A final reports, about 150 B final reports, over 200 C final reports, more than 100 NC final and 70 cases were closed as abated from the cases registered since January this year. The officers are confident that by the end of this year, the range is expected to complete the probe and dispose well over 80% cases registered this year. Senior police officers from the range are now openly giving credit to the women constables for their contribution in probing cases within stipulated time. “The increased number of investigation officers has brought down the pressure as well as number of cases probed by each IO, giving them more time for quality probe,” said Jalna superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/woman-cops-get-investigation-training-reduce-case-pendency/articleshow/87404103.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kanpur||2 IAF staffers, one civilian test positivefor Zika virus in Kanpur, tally rises to 4||Revised Kanpur: Three more people, two Indian Air Force personnel and a civilian, tested positive for Zika virus in the city on Saturday, raising the tally to four. The first Zika case of the state was confirmed in a 57-year-old IAF personnel, a resident of Pardewanpurwa Pokharpur in the district on October 23. Subsequently, the authorities had sent 22 samples of the people who were in close contact with the infected person, for testing to KGMU lab in Lucknow. Those 22 samples, however, tested negative. Two of the three newly infected people are IAF personnel, aged 30 and 31, and residents of Adarshnagar, while the third is a 41-year-old civilian from Shyamanagar area of Chakeri. The infection of Zika has now taken three localities of the Chakeri area into its grip, officials said. After receiving the report of the three infected persons on Saturday, district magistrate Kanpur Nagar Vishak G Iyer and chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh reached the Air Force station with a team of health department and KMC officers. “With the three news cases, the tally now rose to four in the city. A total of 260 samples of IAF personnel, besides those of civilians, have been sent to KGMU lab in Lucknow in the past couple of days,” the DM told TOI. “The report which we received on Saturday confirmed three more persons were positive for Zika virus. One of the three fresh cases detected today was found to be asymptomatic,” the DM said and added, “The state’s first case of the virus was confirmed in an IAF personnel on October 23. The condition of the first Zika patient is stable as per the doctors.” “However, the 22 persons including the family members, relatives and close contacts of the first case have tested negative for the virus,” he said further. A high alert has been sounded in the periphery of the hangers, including the hanger no: 7 & 8 of IAF, besides the adjoining civilian localities including Pardewanpurwa Pokharpur, Adarshnagar and Shyamnagar localities of Chakeri regarding the mosquito-borne virus. The DM further said that he has also directed Kanpur Municipal Corporation officials to conduct an intensive drive to stop the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes in and around the Air Force station, besides the civil pockets, particularly Pardewanpurwa Pokharpur, Adarshnagar and Shyamnagar areas of Chakeri. He said all arrangements are in place for the treatment of the infected at Air Force Hospital and Lala Lajpat Rai hospital. “I have also asked Air Force authorities to take samples and prepare a list of all pregnant women in the Air Force substation area, besides Adarshnagar and Shyamnagar. Along with this, urine and blood samples of Air Force personnel have been taken. Samples are also being taken of the relatives and acquaintances of the infected IAF personnel,” the DM said further. The CMO said that after the detection of three more Zika cases on Saturday, screening is being done around the house of all the newly infected by declaring their respective pockets with nearly 400 houses as a containment zone. “Survey teams have so far sent 493 samples to the National Virology Center, Pune. On Saturday also 126 samples were taken which will be sent on Sunday,” said CMO further and added, “Treatment of all three patients has started in isolation for 14 days at the Air Force hospital.” To check the spread and track the source of Zika virus, the 74 teams of the health department have been collecting samples of people, including pregnant women and Air Force personnel from across 55,000 households during a door-to-door survey underway in Pardevanpurwa Pokharpurwa under the supervision of experts from Delhi and Lucknow. After the detection of the first case on October 23, a high-level multidisciplinary team comprising an entomologist, public health specialists and gynaecologist from the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme, National Centre for Disease Control and RML Hospital, New Delhi was sent by the Union Health ministry on October 25 in Pardevanpurwa area of Pokharpur in Kanpur. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), protection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is a key measure to prevent ZIKV infection. Special attention should be given to the prevention of mosquito bites among pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and young children. Aedes mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools, and workplaces. It is important to eliminate these mosquito breeding sites by appropriate methods, including: covering water storage containers, removing standing water in flower pots, and cleaning up trash and used tires.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/2-iaf-staffers-one-civilian-test-positivefor-zika-virus-in-kanpur-tally-rises-to-4/articleshow/87410234.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Police are viewing footage of CCTV cameras located in the area to identify the suspect. Police suspect that the chain snatcher came to the area on foot and might have parked his/her vehicle at a distance before walking to the elderly woman’s house. The complainant said, “My mother closed her eyes as soon as the chilli powder was thrown at her. She was in pain for around 15 minutes when the suspect snatched her gold chain.

---||Kanpur||First Metro trial conducted on mainline||Kanpur: For the first time since first metro set arrived in the industrial city last month, a trial was conducted on Saturday evening on the mainline (main metro track) between Depot and Kanpur Vishwavidyalaya metro station (Kanpur University). This was also the first time when Metro chugged out of Depot and ran on the mainline. In the beginning of the week, testing was carried out by running metro train inside Depot. The testing and trials have commenced ahead of Kanpur Metro’s formal trial scheduled to be held in the mid of November. The trial of Kanpur Metro would be carried out under the expert supervision of RDSO (Research Design and Standards Organisation) . After RDSO’s approval, Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) would conduct the final inspection before the official launch of the Metro services for the people. If everything goes as per UPMRC’s set plan, the metro services could be rolled out for people by the end of December or early January. The first set of Kanpur Metro moved out of the depot and headed towards Geeta Nagar and halted for a while after which it left for Kanpur Vishvavidyalaya metro station and came back to the depot. The speed at this time, was less than 10 km/hour. The metro was driven by pilot and was accompanied by officials of rolling stock department of UPMRC who kept observing various parameters while the metro was on the run. The staff of Metro was excited when the first metro set moved out. The three coach train climbed the ramp while moving out of the depot and slowly headed towards Geeta Nagar. At this time, the metro staff was excited for the fact that this was the day they were waiting after the metro work commenced in the city two years ago. It is worth mentioning that the work of metro construction had started in November 2019 and in exactly two years of time, the Metro services have almost become reality. In next two months, common people would be able to board metro and have a ride. This metro in the coming days would run on the nine kilometre route between IIT and Motijheel. The nine km route has nine metro stations-all elevated. On this nine kilometre track, six metro trains will run, while two metro trains would remain in back-up. Each metro train has three coaches and a capacity to retain 974 passengers. At present, depot is housing two metro trains of which one had arrived from Gujarat last month end.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/first-metro-trial-conducted-on-mainline/articleshow/87410268.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

RG leader Manoj Parab, while criticising the government, said that chief minister Pramod Sawant refused permission to hold a meeting. He claimed that they were initially allowed to hold a meeting, but that it was subsequently denied at the eleventh hour. “Mamata Banerjee, Congress, AAP and others are allowed to hold meetings, so why are we not allowed? Are we traitors or terrorists? We are not committing any crime by organising meetings,” said Parab. Meanwhile, during a meeting with Parab, a five-member delegation of RG met Bicholim police inspector Mahesh Gadekar. He clarified that the police had informed the deputy collector that there was no force available to handle the situation if an emergency arose during the meeting, as most of the personnel had been deployed on security duty of political functionaries, and hence, no permission had been accorded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/rg-workers-march-to-police-station/articleshow/87410255.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Allahabad||Reward on dacoit Gauri Yadav had gone up by Rs 4.50L in 8 yrs||Prayagraj: With the elimination of notorious bandit Udaybhan Yadav alias Gauri Yadav, the bandit menace seems to have met its end in the hilly terrain of Chitrakoot. The bandit who was gunned down by the STF on early Saturday morning had created terror in Patha and adjoining forest on the border of UP and MP for a decade and was an obstacle to several development projects in the region. The dreaded Gauri Yadav was wanted by both the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh police, with reward money on his head for several years. The cops were involved in an intense search out for clues for at least six years to get inputs for preparing the sketch of the dreaded bandit. The reward on his head had gone up from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5, 50,000 in the last years. In the year 2013, Udaybhan Yadav alias Gauri Yadav was listed as the gang leader of a new group (Inter-State 30) and carried a reward of Rs one lakh on his head at that time, which went up to Rs 5,50,000 in 2021. It is said that Gauri was fond of foreign-made guns, sports shoes, and the latest electronic gadgets. After the elimination of major dacoit gangs like Dadua, Thokia, and Balkaria, the bandit Gauri Yadav was quite successful in establishing his supremacy in the Patha forest area as he got infamous for seeking “goonda tax” (extortion money) from contractors working on sites of various development projects. He and his henchmen assaulted labourers several times to create terror in the area. The Special Task Force (STF) of UP police gunned down the notorious, resident of Belhari village, near Madho Bandha forest area under the limits of Bahilpurwa police station of Chitrakoot district early Saturday morning. An AK-47 rifle, an old model of a semi-automatic rifle, one 0.12 bore factory-made gun along with a huge cache of cartridges were recovered from the spot. Born in Belhari village in Chitrakoot as Udaybhan alias Gauri Yadav in 1976, he was hardly interested in studies and had worked for a brief while as a tractor driver. He executed his first crime in 2005 in the Nayagav police station area of Satna district of MP and an extortion case was filed against him. His terror only grew after that incident. The killing of the dreaded dacoit brought smiles back on the faces of residents of Patha and adjoining villages before the festival of Diwali as they were terrified and fed up by the extortion menace unleashed by Gauri and his men. The dacoit also had several encounters with both MP and UP police forces and finally fell to the police bullet on October 30 in an encounter with UP STF. The dossier also revealed that the STF had arrested Gauri Yadav on January 19, 2009, and recovered a looted police (self-loading rifle) SLR along with a magazine from him. In 2013, Gauri Yadav was accused of killing a Delhi Police sub-inspector, following which a case under sections 147, 148, 302, 307, 404, 353, 186 and 120 B of the IPC was registered. Moreover, the bandit had also kidnapped and murdered a youth in the Manikpur area of Chitrakoot district in 2017. Police claimed that a total of 50 cases, most related to extortion and assault, were registered against the dacoit in different police stations of the two states. Police had eliminated major bandit gangs of Shiv Kumar alias Dadua (July 22, 2007), Ambika Patel alias Thokia (August 4, 2008), Sundar Lal alias Ramsiya Patel(December 24, 2011), Sudesh Patel alias Balkharia (July 15, 2015) and BaluliKol and Lovlesh Kol (September 15, 2019) in the hilly regions of Chitrakoot and along the UP-MP border between 2007 and 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/reward-on-dacoit-gauri-yadav-had-gone-up-by-rs-4-50l-in-8-yrs/articleshow/87440814.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Massive turnout in Huzurabad leaves TRS and BJP on edge||HYDERABAD: The people of Huzurabad came out and voted in large numbers on Saturday, making many wonder if it was still a neck-and-neck battle as had been predicted or if the voters had handed an easy victory to one of the two sides. Till 7 pm as many as 86.33% of the 2.37 lakh voters had gotten inked. Election Commission officials said that there were still many people in queue after the deadline and the voting percentage would rise marginally when the final numbers come in. All the same, 86.33% is the highest Huzurabad has voted so far. In 2014, the constituency had seen 77.54% voting. This rose to 84% in 2018 when chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao went for early elections resulting in a landslide win for TRS. At the time, Eatala had won the seat easily for TRS. Incidently, Palair constituency in Khamman had set a record of sorts by clocking 92.1% voting. The Huzurabad by-election is being seen as a grudge match between KCR and TRS turncoat Eatala Rajender. Ealata, who is contesting on a BJP ticket, had resigned from both TRS and as MLA after KCR had dropped him from the cabinet on charges of corruption and land-grabbing. A win for TRS here would give a stamp of approval for KCR’s welfare politics. However, if Eatala beats TRS’ Gellu Srinivas Yadav, it would establish BJP as the main opposition in Telangana and galvanise it ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. It would also be the third major electoral setback for TRS in less than a year after defeats in the Dubbak assembly by-election and the Hyderabad civic polls. On Saturday evening, both BJP and TRS claimed they would emerge victorious in the by-election. Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel said that polling went on largely peacefully. “Initially, we had technical problems with EVMs in a few polling booths, but we had six Bharat Electronics Limited engineers on standby and they cleared the glitches.” Both TRS and BJP filed complaints against each other with the Election Commission alleging electoral malpractice. “Cases were booked in all violations,” Goel said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/massive-turnout-in-huzurabad-leaves-trs-and-bjp-on-edge/articleshow/87410261.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Duo held, seven gold chains & bike worth Rs 9L seized||Pune: The city police crime branch recovered seven gold chains and a high-end sports bike, collectively worth Rs9 lakh, following the recent arrest of two suspects from Nashik and Ahmednagar. The two suspects — aged 28 and 31 years — had been snatching gold chains since September this year. The suspects — from Nashik road and Shrirampur in Ahmednagar district — were relatives, a police officer told TOI. “Three chain snatching incidents were reported in the jurisdictions of the Kondhwa, Wanowrie and Hadapsar police on October 14 night,”senior inspector Hemant Patil from crime branch (unit V) told TOI on Saturday. The police started conducting parallel investigations and started examining closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at the spots where the incident had occurred. “We checked 550 CCTV cameras on a 150km stretch between Kondhwa and Baramati and established the identity of the two men on a bike. A police team led by assistant inspector Prasad Lonare arrested the two suspects from their hideouts on October 24,” Patil added. Patil said, “During questioning, the duo admitted to their involvement in three robbery incidents in Kondhwa and its two neighbouring suburbs and we recovered three gold chains and a sports bike from them.” The suspects also admitted to snatching four more chains of women, including two from Sinhagad Road and one each from the Loni Kalbhor and Vishrantwadi areas since September. “We recovered four chains from the possession of their relatives,”the senior inspector said. The senior police inspector said that the two suspects would wear helmets and one of them would ride the bike, while the other would snatch chains and flee. “While one of the two suspects does not have any criminal antecedents, the other one has a body offence case registered against him with the Ahmednagar police in 2013,” he said. The duo were unemployed and had studied till Class XII, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/duo-held-seven-gold-chains-bike-worth-rs-9l-seized/articleshow/87406988.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sweet shops in Kharar, Kurali inspected; samples seized||Mohali: The food safety team inspected sweet shops and bakeries in Kharar and Kurali on Saturday. The team took 10 samples and challaned two bakeries for preparing items unhygienically. The food safety wing of Mohali health department said the surprise checks were conducted in Kharar and Kurali to curb adulteration of sweets in the festive season.

---||Mumbai||Even as theatres reopen, Maharashtra’s tent cinemas stay on pause||Till a few years ago, any resemblance of mass Telugu action hero Gopichand to mass Bollywood action hero Ajay Devgn was not purely coincidental, at least in pockets of Marathwada that film distributors refer to as ‘Nizam circuit’. Two researchers had found that diehard Gopichand fans in Jalna, Beed, Nanded, Aurangabad, Osmanabad, Nanded, Parbhani and circuits such as Vidarbha used to believe Gopichand to be “Arjun Devgn”, Devgn’s dagger-wielding brother. This myth wasn’t the handiwork of fake news but that of morphed film posters and drunk announcers that populated the fast-shrinking world of Maharashtra’s tent cinemas. Once an important 2000-strong Marathi cinema distribution platform, the state’s touring talkies—nomadic theatres that travel from village to village atop trucks appended with projectors to beam Hindi, Marathi and dubbed Telugu movies into ‘tambus’—have now been reduced to mere C-grade box office windows by the viral ravages of saas-bahu soaps, mobile phones, Wi-Fi and OTT platforms. Besides the recent freightload of Covid-induced debts, shutdowns and job losses, the parked trucks of the 52 surviving tents are rusting under another fresh death blow. “Tambu talkies is not on the state’s list of entertainment venues that were allowed to reopen recently,” says Sanjay Dhadwe, owner of Nashik’s Pushpanjali Talkies and president of Maharashtra Touring Cinema Association, who has been writing urgent, attention-seeking letters to the ministry of culture. “We have spent our whole lives in this business. If we’re not allowed to reopen, we will have to shut shop forever,” says 43-year-old Dhadwe, speaking for the over-half-century-old fraternity for whom “rasoda” refers to the cost of the Rs 5000-odd, eight-day-long meals required to sustain the crew of gatekeepers and booking clerks and “batta” is code for the daily payments of Rs 50-per-worker for tea and snacks. Together with the under-and-over-the-table payments made to tehsildars, village heads and cops, EMI-ridden owners now stare at an average bill of Rs 70,000 per movie. The math wasn’t as complicated in the 1950s when tent cinemas began after a few farmers, lawyers and electricians carted off second hand Bauer projectors from a Parsi businessman who was selling them on a footpath in Bombay. In the remote villages that lacked concrete cinemas, they began screening mythologicals that had viewers taking off their footwear before entering the tents. Steadily, the tents rose to become eight-day-long jatra-time fixtures. Besides encore-demanding goons, drunks and dacoits, night shows here would draw benign housewives . While reels would sometimes arrive on lumbering elephants, reviews would arrive in a flash. Once when the chartbuster song ‘Ganga Kinare wala’ from Amitabh's ‘Don’ was abruptly interrupted by technical issues, “some audience members tore the tent,” recalls 52-year-old Neeraj Kamble, manager of Buldhana’s Anand Touring Talkies. Mud-slinging on the part of the crowd that arrives with blankets, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Says Mohammed Navrangi—who rose from the errand boy who would plant flags atop posters signalling the show that is on to the smooth-talking co-owner of Buldhana’s Sumedh Touring Talkies: “If they like a scene or dialogue, some audience members take a bit of gravel from the ground and throw it in the air.” It is this rustic earthiness that had compelled spunky Marathi actor Trupti Bhoir to bottle the kitschy world inside the 2013 Marathi film ‘Touring Talkies’. The movie contains her nods to projectionists who would sometimes pull the film reel so quickly that it would make Amitabh sound squeaky and to women viewers who would watch the film on the other side of the screen in overcrowded shows. “They would complain to the sarpanch saying though the film was in Marathi, it looked Gujarati as the women’s sari pallus were now to the left as the image was reversed,” laughs Bhoir who got half-century old trucks of tent cinema towed into Mumbai since vehicles over 15 years could not legally enter city limits. The ordeal reopened Bhoir’s eyes to the many practicalities thwarting the growth of touring talkies—a pathos that had once prompted A R Rahman to adopt a tent cinema for a year. If saas-bahu serials robbed the tent cinemas of a good chunk of the Rs-30-a-ticket sales revenue, “today, boys sometimes show us their phones saying the film we are charging for, is available for free online,” says Kamble. Recently, the state’s touring cinema association—whose economics includes electricity bills of Rs 5000, electricity testing reports of Rs 2500, gram panchayat rent, digital server rent, taxes, deposits, rasoda and batta apart from distributor quotations of over Rs 1 lakh for new releases such as the upcoming ‘Sooryavanshi’—sent a memorandum to the state demanding financial assistance of at least Rs 1 to 2 lakh per head. “We also need interest-free loans,” says Vijay Kulkarni, owner of three tent cinemas — Vijay, Vaibhav and Shriram — that aspire to a future of ACs, digital servers and a revolutionary piece of equipment that will make them resemble single-screens: “Chairs.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/even-as-theatres-reopen-maharashtras-tent-cinemas-stay-on-pause/articleshow/87410284.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Goa||AAP hits out at Goa CM Pramod Sawant for ‘copying’ announcements||PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party accused the Pramod Sawant-led government of copying Arvind Kejriwal’s model in the announcement to set up skill universities. “In doing this, he has directly copied Arvind Kejriwal's announcement that he would set up a skill university on the lines of Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU). It is worth noting that Sawant had earlier blamed students and youth themselves for ‘sitting at home with degrees’,” AAP stated. Unemployment has become the biggest issue in Goa and has hit the BJP government like a tonne of bricks, the party stated, adding that youth across the state have been demanding jobs which BJP has been unable to provide. “All this while BJP has used two excuses for Goenkars. Excuse 1 is that they will provide 10,000 jobs. This excuse has been peddled and recycled every month and every election with no fruition in site. Excuse 2 that youth are sitting at home wasting their degrees. The Sawant government which has failed to find jobs or train youth in employable skills tried to blame its failure on the youth themselves,” the party added. Kejriwal, in his visit last month, announced jobs for every youth and Rs 3,000 per month until they receive jobs and 80% of jobs in the private sector reserved for the youth of Goa. An amount of Rs 5,000 would be provided monthly assistance to families who lost employment due to shutdown of tourism and mining, Kejriwal had stated, adding that AAP government will further establish a skill university in Goa on the lines of Delhi’s DSEU and bring an end to nepotism in government jobs in Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/aap-hits-out-at-sawant-for-copying-announcements/articleshow/87411323.cms||---

The matter came to light on Saturday when some locals noticed murky water in the river. “Since Saturday morning, Kanhan water had turned milky white. When the residents tried to find out the reason, while patrolling upstream, they noticed a stream of ash flowing out from the ash pond of the Khaperkheda Thermal Power Station (KTPS) into Waregaon drain,” said the residents, who wished not to be identified. They also shared the photographs of a nullah containing ash-laden water flowing into Kanhan river. TOI has snaps and videos shared by the locals. It was confirmed by sources in the power plant that due to technical snag, ash from the pond accidentally got released into the outer drain of Waregaon, which flows into Kanhan river. As the Kanhan water treatment plant (WTP) cannot treat ash-laden water in the river, pumps located on the right bank stopped functioning. Due to this, the WTP operated at only 50% capacity from Saturday noon till late evening. This unexpected interruption in Kanhan pumping caused less and low-pressure water supply in the command areas connected to Kanhan feeder main. NMC’s water works department too confirmed that water supply to 28 elevated storage reservoirs in four zones — Ashi Nagar, Lakadganj, Satranjipura and Nehru Nagar — was disrupted. During regular round of ash handling, the plant team came to know about whitish discharge flowing toward Kamptee Road bridge and it was observed that ash filter on the nullah was in completely collapsed condition, KTPS undertook remedial measures on war footing, said KTPS chief engineer Raju Ghuge. He also said in a couple of days new Nandgaon ash bund would be made operational to reduce burden on Waregaon bund. In the past too, KTPS had been in the news for discharging polluted water in Kanhan. Activist Anil Wadpalliwar and AAP leader Pratap Goswami had exposed similar happenings in the past and TOI had been highlighting this. Environment activist and founder-director of Centre for Sustainable Development Leena Buddhe said this is blatant violation of norms by the KTPS and all at the cost of lives and livelihood of the people. “Health of all living beings is being compromised. Strict action needs to be taken by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and MoEFCC,” she said and pointed out that this needs to be stopped or we all are doomed. Kanhan river is the main source of drinking water for Nagpur and also to all villages around the power plant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ktps-fly-ash-in-kanhan-river-hits-water-supplyto-half-of-nagpur/articleshow/87408751.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Low pungency of the leaves is preferred by the people for paan and more health benefits. Farmers from Sholavandan area started an association for welfare of the betel vine cultivators, functioning since 1964. In this same area, a few farmers who cultivated other crops still dedicated a small space of their farm land for the cultivation of betel leaves, which they send to the Kallalagar temple as per tradition. It is also believed that Europeans came to the village in the past to purchase betel leaf as it was believed to be the best in the region.There are many books and inscriptions which depict the proof of cultivation and historical details. Details of betel vine cultivation were mentioned in the 5th century CE dated inscriptions of the famous temple of “Jenaga Narayanasamy Perumal, Sholavandan. The inscription says: “The betel farmers in the Sholavandan area should donate the income of betel cultivation to the Jenaga Narayana Perumal Temple. The farmers can receive three times the amount spent for the temple from the king of Pandya kingdom.”Madurai Kanchi, an ancient Tamil poem in Sangam literature describes a Madurai market and its products, especially betel leaves. It says that the leaves are cultivated by a community of farmers called “ Kodikkal Pillaimar”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/gi-tag-sought-for-sholavandan-betel-leaf/articleshow/87408698.cms||---

The statue was installed at Khanderao Gate where the incident had occurred, and the road leading to the city has been named after him. People were seen raising slogans for the slain Kar Sewak claiming him to be a martyr. Earlier, a grand programme was held inside the packed Deendayal auditorium where the parents of Jagat were felicitated by Jhansi-Lalitpur MP Anurag Sharma, mayor, Ram Teerath Singhal and MLA, Ravi Sharma in the presence of other senior party leaders. Those who had been injured during the police firing were also felicitated. In 1990, hundreds of Kar Sewaks, who headed towards Ayodhya in support of construction of Ram Mandir, were arrested in Jhansi and kept at Laxmi Vyayam Mandir (LVM). On October 30, 1990 as Jagat and his friends went towards LVM, suddenly police started firing at them and in the incident Jagat succumbed while many of his friends sustained injuries. Former BJP city president Pradeep Sarogi, who conceived and co-ordinated the entire programme said that all those who had lost their lives for the cause of Ram Temple, especially during the demolition of Babri Masjid, should be felicitated in similar manner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/statue-of-kar-sewak-killed-in-police-firing-in-1990-installed-in-jhansi/articleshow/87410364.cms||---
---||Goa||U-23 Asian Cup: India finish second in group, but it’s not good enough to qualify||The referees were preparing for a shower when they were told there was still work to do on the field. India had just finished goalless against Kyrgyz Republic in the concluding clash of the AFC U-23 Asian Cup qualifiers at the Fujairah Stadium in UAE on Saturday. The teams had four points each, the same goal difference (zero) and equal number of goals scored in all matches (two). So to decide who finishes second in the group, a penalty shootout was ordered. Dheeraj Singh, magnificent for 90 minutes, told his teammates he would save at least two penalties, and the goalkeeper lived up to his word as India won the tiebreaker 4-2. Striker Rahim Ali, who converted the fifth penalty, took off his jersey and celebrated wildly. The other players joined him too, but AFC’s competition rules suggest India have little or no chance of qualifying for next year’s AFC U-23 Asian Cup in Uzbekistan. The top teams in each of the 11 groups qualify directly, while the other four spots are reserved for the second best-placed team. Uzbekistan qualify automatically as hosts. UAE, who defeated Oman 2-0 earlier in the day, finished on top of group E to qualify. India had to settle for the second spot with four points, their best showing ever in the competition, but there was little else to celebrate. Since some groups had just three teams, the participants played different number of matches in total. “In order to ensure equality, all participating teams shall be compared across the same number of matches, the number of which shall be decided by the AFC. In principle, the results between the relevant participating teams and the bottom-placed participating team in the relevant group shall be considered null and void,” states AFC’s competition operations manual 2021. This essentially leaves India with just one point -- draw against Kyrgyz Republic – since the opening night’s 2-1 win against bottom-placed Oman will be wiped out in the final analysis. Among the second-placed teams at the moment, Tajikistan, Syria, Bahrain, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia are all ahead of India “I am very proud about how our boys performed and deservedly got second place in the group,” said India coach Igor Stimac. “I think everyone is surprised to see us placed second. This just proves that the project which started years ago with Indian Arrows and the under-17 World Cup were the right steps in developing a new generation of players who will have more confidence on the pitch and not hesitate to face anyone."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/u-23-asian-cup-india-finish-second-in-group-but-its-not-good-enough-to-qualify/articleshow/87442523.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Ganesh Shetty, the president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said that staff shortage has become a concern. “Around 35% of staff who went back home, have not returned. After they left, they found other forms of employment and they do not want to return, despite assurances. Most of them are now settled in their new jobs. Furthermore, the relaxations have resulted in around 7,000 eateries opening in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. With many eateries opening daily, the staff shortage has become more serious,” he said. “Many of our patrons have started visiting our restaurant following the relaxations. However, we just have three servers to cater to them,” the manager of a restaurant-cum-bar at Hadapsar said. The manager of another restaurant at Kondhwa said that they were forced to shut a small section of the outlet due to staff crunch. “Apart from fewer servers, we are facing a shortage of kitchen staff, too. The numbers have gone down to just five from the earlier 12. Hence, we have had to reduce our menu drastically,” a representative of another eatery said. Restaurant-goers said the waiting time at many places has increased by almost 40 minutes. “They should hire more staff,” Katraj resident Shantanu Dixit said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/eateries-struggle-with-staff-crunch/articleshow/87407110.cms||Joy Sengupta

This followed an incident at the university wherein a guest lecturer was asked to cancel his lecture on “Periyar and Islam” due to opposition from a right wing group. However, on the intervention of the higher education department, the lecture was held.The circular dated October 28 signed by the university’s registrar (in charge) Dr R Maruthakutti directed all departments to get permission well in advance before any seminar, conference, workshop etc., is held. It also said that the note should contain the model invitation, details of the resource person, speaker, target group, date, time and all relevant details and this practice must be adhered to scrupulously.The controversy kicked off when guest lecturer Samuel Asirraj, who was organising a series of lectures on “Periyar, social justice and enlightenment”, was asked by the university to cancel his lecture on “Periyar and Islam” after opposition from Hindu Munnani. The matter was brought to the attention of higher education department which took it up with the university and the lecture had to be allowed. Sources said protesters of right-wing groups turned up on the day of the lecture on October 27, but they were not allowed in. The protesters said they will petition the Chancellor on the matter.Educationists and activists linked to Madurai Kamaraj, Manonmaniam Sundaranar, Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teachers' Association (MUTA) and Save Higher Education Movement, Tamil Nadu (SHE-TN), have come out against the circular, terming it oppressive.“The university is using this incident as an excuse to clamp down on academic freedom. It is attempting to bring in censorship. Shrinking democratic spaces in the university cause much of a concern. Such a regulation can prevent progressive thinkers and those from minority groups from expressing themselves,” said Dr R Murali, secretary, SHE-TN. “This takes away autonomy. Anyone can be for or against an opinion or issue. But the university must allow room for debate and not restrict airing of the opinion,” M Nagarajan, general secretary, MUTA, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/after-bar-on-lecture-msu-circular-now-kicks-up-row/articleshow/87408729.cms||---

Heavy weekend rush (Friday, Saturday and Sunday), ever since restaurants were allowed to extend operational deadline beyond 4pm, has consistently ensured good business for the industry, one of the most-affected by Covid shutdowns. Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association (PRAHA) told TOI, “There is a wait list of an average 50 people at fine-dining restaurants on weekends after 9pm. Several restaurants have also restricted table reservations beyond 8-9pm to ensure they do not lose out on walk-ins.” Praful Chandawarkar, director, Malaka Spice, said, “Daily business for some popular restaurants in Koregaon Park has reached 80-85% of pre-pandemic level. We are being cautious and following all protocols despite the surge in footfall.” Chandawarkar said one measure that increased business for his restaurant was the introduction of breakfast menu during the pandemic. “We have been opening the restaurant at 8.30am as against the 11am opening time before the pandemic. Many turn up for breakfast in the morning, pushing up total covers. Relaxation in timings till 12am recently has also helped fine dining restaurants to get more busines,” said Chandawarkar. Vikram Shetty, restaurateur and executive committee member, Poona Hoteliers’ Association, said business for restaurants had touched 60-70% of pre-pandemic levels in certain pockets. “However, business is still on the lower side for restaurants in some other pockets like Hinjewadi and Vimannagar,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/restaurants-capitalise-on-weekend-rush/articleshow/87407103.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS-BJP skirmishes turn Huzurabad a battleground||HYDERABAD: Allegations of influencing voters at polling booths and distribution of money resulted in skirmishes during the Huzurabad bypoll on Saturday. TRS and BJP activists attacked each other at many places and police had a tough time to disperse them. BJP alleged that the ruling party leaders were trying to influence voters at the polling booths, while TRS leaders denied the charges and claimed the saffron party leaders were making the allegations out of frustration. There was mild tension in Jammikunta, Kamalapur and Veenavanka mandals in the constituency. Just a couple of hours after polling began, BJP workers at Ganmukkala in Veenavanka raised objections when TRS leader Padi Kaushik Reddy was going into a polling station at Zilla Parishad Secondary School in the village. The local BJP leaders raised slogans that he should not be allowed inside the polling booth. He faced a similar experience at another polling station at Jammikunta, alleging that he was a non-local and canvassing for his party candidate. Kaushik Reddy explained that he could enter any polling station in the constituency as he was appointed chief election agent by his party and came to see the polling process. TRS leaders said their BJP counterparts were making allegations against Kaushik Reddy out of frustration. In Jammikuta town, BJP leaders and TRS activists came to blows as scores of saffron workers reached local councillor Deepthi’s house, alleging that she was distributing money to voters. Similar incident were reported in Challur, where they alleged local municipal chairman was distributing money to the voters. TRS leaders denied the allegations. Both parties’ leaders claimed that rivals influenced the voters by distributing cash through non-locals. In Sriramulapally village, locals picked up an argument with Gajwel market committee chairman Madasu Srinivas when he visited a polling station. The local leaders alleged that he came to the booth to influence voters. Later, he left the booth with the help of police. TRS and BJP workers clashed at Himmatnagar and Korkal over the claims that the local sarpanch was canvassing for the TRS candidate at the polling station. At Himmatnagar, locals tried to attack a vehicle, but police dispersed youth. Meanwhile, TRS lodged a complaint against BJP candidate and former minister Eatala Rajender that he violated the model code of conduct and spoke to the media at Kamalapur after casting his vote in his hometown. In Maripallygudem in Kamalapur, there was mild tension when police stopped Rajender’s convey, saying three vehicles were not permitted by the Election Commission. TRS candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav said BJP workers tried to disrupt the polling process at several places by bringing in outsiders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-skirmishes-turn-huzurabad-a-battleground/articleshow/87410397.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Scaling down PGI OPD was toughest call, but it worked, says Professor Jagat Ram||CHANDIGARH: PGI director Professor Jagat Ram will complete his five-year term on Sunday. Although he faced several challenges during 42 years and four months in PGI as a resident and faculty, the toughest time he faced as a clinician was the Covid pandemic. In a conversation with Shimona Kanwar, he recounts the tough decisions he had to take During your 5-year tenure, what was the most challenging or tough call you had to make and why?Ans: The most challenging time of my directorship was the Covid-19 pandemic. We, as a health care fraternity, faced such an enormous challenge after almost 100 years. The toughest call at the beginning was scaling down the PGI OPD for the general public. It was a difficult decision, but one that had to be taken. In retrospect, scaling down the OPD and starting teleconsultation not only prevented PGI OPD’s from becoming super-spreader places, but also gave us time to strategise and come up with efficient ways to protect both our healthcare workers and patients. Setting up facilities to tackle Covid patients was done at a war footing. A Covid management task force was constituted, and a dedicated Covid-19 facility was established in the Nehru Hospital Extension block. Emergency services were never stopped, but all patients being admitted for ailments other than Covid were tested prior to admission / surgery. Covid testing facilities were scaled up rapidly and facility for Gene-expert testing for emergency cases was also established. Being an institute of national importance, our role does not end with us. We mentored over 70 labs from all over north India and served as the referral center for moderate - severe Covid cases from the neighbouring states. The second wave came with its own challenges with an overwhelming caseload of severe cases straining our intensive care facilities and the flurry of Mucormycosis cases only complicated the situation. But we all worked as a team and got through those testing times. You have been able to emphasise research, fast paced establishment of satellite centers and other centers. What more could you have given to the institute had you been given another year?Dean, research and sub-dean, research post were created in addition to dean and subdean, academic. During my tenure, research was given priority. Number of research publications increased from 1,500 in 2017 to 2,550 in 2021. With the extension of one year in service, beside strengthening our preparation for the possible third wave of the Covid pandemic; I would have created department of family medicine as well as department of rheumatology and immunology at the institute. I would have started work on Geriatrics Centre, initiated work at the allocated 50.76 acre land at Sarangpur i.e 500-bedded trauma centre, screening OPD, 500-bedded Cancer Centre, 600-bedded Gastroenterology and Hepatology Centre, Endocrinology Centre and learning resource centre. A centre for infectious diseases has also been part of my vision for the institute. If you look back since the time you joined the institute, are there any regrets or things you believe could have been done better?Ans: Yes, if the Covid-19 pandemic had not happened, I would have focused more on the development of this institute in patient care and research. Streamlining of OPD and emergency areas, faster work on peripheral centers and expansion of services within the institute. You have performed rare surgeries on the paediatric group. What satisfied you the most and why?Ans: We performed high volume of Paediatric Cataract surgeries. Rarest paediatric cataract surgery like management of double crystalline lens in which customised lens was successfully implanted, PHPV--anamoly of the eye-- with cataract in paediatric population was managed with new surgical technique. We achieved global recognition at the World Society of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus in Barcelona, Spain. What is more satisfying than all these awards is seeing them use the sight that we helped them gain. What kind of director do you think PGI should get?Ans: Being an institute of national importance, PGI deserves to get the best person at the helm. The person should not only be an excellent administrator, but also someone who understands the internal working of PGI. PGI has always been getting unreferred cases from adjoining states. Nothing worked to streamline this even during your term. What do you have to say about this?Ans: We are the victims of our own popularity. Every patient seeks to get the best opinion directly from PGI and for the needy we are often the only choice. Inflow of patients has increased from 24 lakh to 29 lakh in the last four years. States have to improve infrastructure at the local level. Hopefully, with opening of AIIMS in every state, things will improve. The PGI director says that the institute is often the only choice for the needyWhat do you plan to do after retirement?It does not matter where I join but I will continue to serve humanity and give sight to all sections of society irrespective of their socio-economic status.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/scaling-down-pgi-opd-was-toughest-call-but-it-worked/articleshow/87407107.cms||Shimona Kanwar

While Bharati hospital has become the first private hospital in the city to reduce the cost of Covishield by Rs100, others are tapping CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds for inoculation of citizens who cannot afford the cost of vaccine, and resorting to inter-hospital exchange of doses to use up the idle stock. Approximately 2.5 to 3 lakh doses are lying with over 200 private vaccination centres in Pune district, said Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune circle Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital said, “We have reduced the cost of Covishield from Rs780 to Rs680. This is to encourage more people to complete their vaccination regime of two doses.” Skin specialist Snehal Porwal, founder, Healing Hands Clinic, “We are also planning to offer a discount on Covid vaccination so that those who want to get the shots in private centres feel encouraged to do so.” “Corporates houses are promoting Covid vaccination through private hospitals by offering CSR funds for inoculation of the poor and needy. This move, in a way, is helping in using up the vaccine stock in the private sector,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI). The newly introduced 'transfer stock' feature on the CoWIN portal has helped in quick exchange and utilisation of unused doses lying with private hospitals in Pune. “Using the stock transfer option, I could get the required vaccine vials from another private hospital,” said Nivedita Oswaldirector and paediatrician, Parasmani hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pvt-centres-cut-jab-cost-tap-csr-funds-to-use-up-idle-vaccine-stock/articleshow/87407129.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||5 Maharashtra hospitals miss out on chance to take part in Corbevax Phase III trial||PUNE: Five out of the seven hospitals in Maharashtra chosen as sites for Biological E’s Corbevax Phase III clinical study missed out on the opportunity, the facilities’ authorities told TOI. Officials from the selected hospitals in Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur told TOI that the trial investigators recently emailed them about reaching the limit of trial volunteers before these sites could get the necessary documentation in place as well as the Ethics Committee approval. When TOI contacted Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm Biological E, an official from the firm declined to share a comment on the matter citing confidentiality. According to the information on Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI), the Phase III clinical study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Biological E’s Corbevax vaccine for protection against Covid was to be conducted at 30 sites, including seven in Maharashtra. Only two hospitals in the state — Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital in Mumbai and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Wardha — could participate in the Phase III trial for adults. This was the first time in Maharashtra that a trial for Corbevax, India’s third indigenous vaccine against Covid-19, was to be conducted for adults. Phase I and II trials of the vaccine were conducted in sites in other states. Hospitals earlier chosen from Pune were YCM Hospital and B J Govt Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals College. In Mumbai, three hospitals were selected — Grant Medical College & Sir J J Hospital; TN Medical College & BYL Nair Hospital; and Tata Memorial Centre. An official from a selected hospital in Nagpur told TOI, “Before we could complete the necessary paperwork and get an approval from the Ethics Committee, the sample size was achieved at other sites. We received a communication in October to not take the process forward further.” The official said the enrolment was the first step of a clinical trial. “Different sites enter the study at different time during the trial period. The sample size is simultaneously calculated as and when volunteers are enrolled. There is no fixed site-specific volunteer number. If the sample size is 3,000, it is not necessary that all the sites should enrol an equal number of volunteers. Therefore, once the sample size was achieved in this case, other selected sites were asked not to go ahead with the process,” he said. A source from a Pune hospital earlier selected for the Corbevax Phase III trial said, “Recruitment for trial volunteers had finished before we got an approval from the Ethics Committee. Hence, the trial could not be conducted. The sponsors sent us a communication in this regard.” Another official from a city-based hospital meant to be the trial site said, “The company had only taken consent from us on our willingness to undertake the trial at our centre. We consented, but we could not get some official documents to start the trial. So, it could not be undertaken.” The principal investigator for the trial in a Mumbai hospital said, “We were in the process of getting the Ethics Committee approval, when we were informed that the volunteer enrolment process had been completed. It was in first week of October. Our site was thus not required to undertake the trial.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/5-maha-hosps-miss-out-on-chance-to-take-part-in-corbevax-phase-iii-trial/articleshow/87407118.cms||Neha Madaan

Earlier, the Supreme Court did not hear his anticipatory bail plea. However, a fine of Rs 2 lakh imposed on him by the High Court was "waived". Notably, a case was registered against Kargeti by Geetaram Nautiyal, joint director of social welfare department in 2016 under the provisions of the SC/ST Act at Basant Vihar police station in Dehradun. After deliberation, a charge-sheet was filed against Kargeti in the trial. Kargeti then filed a petition in the high court in 2017 to quash the chargesheet, the trial court's summons and non-bailable orders. Kargeti was fined Rs 2 lakh for presenting "false facts" before the court, after the HC dismissed his petition in 2018. The SC meanwhile has rejected Kargeti's special bail plea following which he filed a bail application in the HC.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Beechwal industrial area in Bikaner is free of child labour||JAIPUR: The Bikaner administration has started a campaign to make the district free from child labour and has been successful in making it happen for Beechwal industrial area by incorporating support the owners of the industries as well as the factories which operate there. All the owners pledged that they will not employ any child labour and the administration is gradually replicating this movement in other tehsils as well. This campaign started in June and over 40 children were rescued from Beechwal during this period. The child commission has also extended its support to the campaign and is contemplating to take it to other districts as well. Assistant director of child empowerment department, Bikaner, Kavita Swami said, “District collector Namit Mehta formed two teams with the aim that people should be made aware of the laws to prevent them from employing children. The focus was always awareness and not punishment with the priority being given to the well-being of the children. We initially started with Beechwal to understand the ground reality and did an inspection to talk to the owners of the factories in a bid to make them understand that it was illegal to employ children below 18 years of age. They took the pledge and we kept up the momentum as a result of which when we went repeatedly, we realised that the area was free of child labour. Additionally, awareness boards had been also placed at the industries stating that they do not and will not employ children.” The Beechwal industrial area was declared child labour free on October 26. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said, “This was a unique approach to eradicating child labour and should be replicated in other districts as well.” Out of the 46 children rescued, 34 were found to be working as child labour and were mostly boys who hailed from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar as well as West Bengal. Officials claimed that lack of awareness was the main reason that these children were employed in the industrial sector and over 50 owners signed the pledge that they will not employ minors. “When the owners of these industries were told about the laws like the Juvenile Justice Act, they cooperated completely and even gave us all the documents. The aim is not punishment but to ensure that people adhere to the laws. However,I n some cases we also had to take the course of law and 14 FIRs were lodged over the course of three months,” explained Arvind Singh Sengar, member of the Juvenile Justice Board, Bikaner. The authorities comprising of all the various departments are looking to focus on other industrial area in the districts which includes mostly of food processing units to make Bikaner free of child labour in all forms, claimed officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/beechwal-industrial-area-in-bikaner-is-free-of-child-labour/articleshow/87408755.cms||---

The Indian Psychiatric Society is supporting Equally Well Australia, an NGO, in its Global Call to Action to improve access of people with mental illness to vaccines. Dr Debanjan Banerjee, consultant geriatric psychiatrist, Life Fellow, Indian Psychiatric Society, and member, International Psychogeriatric Association, said, “It is not about a separate vaccine reservation for Persons with Severe Mental Illnesses (PwSMI), but what we need is prioritizing vaccination for this segment. Despite easy availability, people with severe mental illnesses such as those suffering from schizophrenia, dementia and bipolar disorders in hospitals and institutions are unable to get access to vaccines on account of their disability.” Dr Gautam Saha, the Indian Psychiatric Society president, said the vaccination rate of homeless people with mental illnesses was low. “Through NGO participation, the government must prioritize their vaccination at the earliest.” Dr Banerjee and Dr Saha are the Indian contributors to this “Global Call for Action”. Indian Psychiatric Society cited reasons such as low vaccination rates in those with severe mental illnesses in India, among others, for their inclusion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/call-to-include-people-with-severe-mental-illness-in-vax-priority-groups/articleshow/87407136.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||Anwar Ali arrives to train with FC Goa, will join club on January 1||Marcus.Mergulhao@timesgroup.com Panaji: Anwar Ali Jr will return to the top-tier of Indian football with FC Goa and kickstart his career all over again. The 21-year-old, among the brightest prospects in Indian football, was barred from playing in 2019 by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), after the detection of a congenital heart condition - Hypertrophic Cardio Myopathy. Since then, he has fought many battles, both on and off the field. While the risk of a sudden cardiac arrest on the field remains, clearances from the Delhi High Court first and then the AIFF medical committee has paved the way for his return to the top-tier of Indian football. Anwar arrived in Goa late on Sunday and will start training with the Durand Cup champions after completing the mandatory eight-day quarantine. “Anwar will train with FC Goa, and if all goes well, make his debut in the Indian Super League (ISL) with the club,” said a source who has tracked the development. The youngster is already contracted with Delhi FC – owned by his mentor and guide Ranjit Bajaj -- for five years, so he can officially move to Goa only when the transfer window opens on January 1, 2022. Anwar will be loaned to Goa for 18 months. According to sources, Goa plan to register Anwar no sooner the transfer window opens and ensure he takes the field against Kerala Blasters FC on January 2. Rules stipulate that players have to be registered 24 hours before a game. “FC Goa were the only team which kept in touch throughout the last one year,” said another source close to the player. “They were serious, had lot of respect for the player. It’s no secret that the club wants a ball-playing defender, they play attacking football and we all know what Anwar can do with the ball at his feet. This is a good fit.” Anwar shot to fame at the U-17 World Cup in 2017 when he played every minute of India’s campaign. He was then a regular for Indian Arrows in the I-League, part of the senior India team too, before tests turned his world upside down. “Anwar is hungry to succeed. The first goal is to play in the ISL, show everyone what he can do and make it to the national team. Once that happens, the sky is the limit,” said the official. Despite being a defender, Anwar ended up with the Golden Boot in the I-League Qualifiers. While allowing Anwar to play again, the AIFF executive committee asked the player to “produce an affidavit claiming full responsibility, along with details of the medical precautions to be taken by him, and his prospective club to make him eligible to play competitive football.” Since his ban, Anwar has gone two seasons outside top-flight football. He played his first professional game on December 6, 2020, and has been playing in the local leagues in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi. “Anwar is super fit. He is playing the entire 90 minutes, does not need to be substituted. He has shown no signs of the medical problem that some doctors unfairly prevented him from playing,” said the official. Records show that Anwar has played more games than any other footballer since football returned in times of Covid-19 pandemic. He played 11 matches in Punjab, six in Himachal Pradesh, four in the Durand Cup, seven in Delhi league and seven in I-League Qualifiers. Even on Sunday, he arrived in Goa after doing duty for Delhi FC in the Super Division League. For the next two months, it will be just training, before he makes his much-anticipated debut in the ISL, possibly on January 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/anwar-ali-arrives-to-train-with-fc-goa-will-join-club-on-january-1/articleshow/87442599.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Ahmedabad||Equity, mutual funds trump gold||AHMEDABAD: Stock market and mutual fund investments possibly became the new gold for investors since Diwali last year or in Vikram Samvat 2077. As the Indian equity markets continued touching new highs, delivering high returns, fresh inflows into stocks and mutual funds continued from both retail and high net-worth individuals (HNIs). Unlike gold, which remained to be the apple of investors’ eye for three good years delivering high returns, the focus of the majority of the investors turned to equities. Explaining this, Tejas Shukla, founder-director of Artham Finometry, an Ahmedabad-based financial advisory firm, said, "Gold remained the classic safe haven for investors during the uncertain times of the pandemic. However, since October last year, as the economy began swimming out of the aftershocks of Covid-19, and the total lockdown of 2020 backed by improved demand and industrial output, investors’ confidence in equity markets was restored." With improvement in domestic and export demand, production cycles resumed normalcy making companies profitable. "This coupled with an overall improved sentiment with vaccine rollout kept stock market indices in an upward trend. At the same time, lower bank interest rates and unavailability of any other suitable asset class shifted the focus of investors towards equity markets," he added. Unrest and volatility of stock markets around the second wave of Covid-19 too failed to dampen sentiment. New demat accounts were opened and SIP inflows too improved. Primary market too yields attractive returnsEven as the secondary market continued to yield handsome returns, the primary market too witnessed a flurry of activities with a large number of initial public offers being made by companies to cash in on the current investor euphoria. Investors were not disappointed in the primary market either. Majority of IPOs launched by companies in 2021 have provided positive returns over their issue prices. For instance: Out of eight IPOs floated by Gujarat-based companies this year, six have yielded positive returns. Stocks emerge as star performersRiding on the red-hot rally in stock markets, equity has beaten other asset classes such as gold and bank deposits by delivering handsome returns to investors since Diwali last year. Benchmark equity index Sensex has offered a staggering 40% return to investors as the index rose from 43,637.98 points on November 14, 2020 (the date on which Diwali was celebrated last year) to 61,143.33 points on October 27, 201. The immense liquidity flowing into the market, entry of new investors with more money in hands, and strong investor sentiment have fuelled stock market rally, say stock market analysts. According to Tejas Shukla, founder-director of Artham Finometry, huge amounts of additional liquidity provided by central banks across the world kept chasing Equities. Flows from both foreign and domestic investors remained strong throughout the past one year. And since the effects of the second wave of the pandemic started wearing off, equity markets have not looked behind at all. Bank deposit growth slows; investors shift towards share market, MFsStalled capital expenditures and expansion plans due to pandemic-induced uncertainty, coupled with individuals increasing their emergency savings, propelled bank deposits to grow. However, investors slowly began shifting towards mutual funds and stocks lured by better gains, suggest bankers. "Bank deposits have definitely increased in the past one year as more people saved money to meet medical emergencies. At the same time, business expenditures earmarked for expansion were stalled due to the pandemic-induced uncertainty. As a consequence, deposits surely swelled," said M M Bansal, convener, State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) – Gujarat. Bank deposit rates remained stagnant at 4.9% over the past one year. "Investors saw better gains in equity markets and mutual funds investment backed by the rising market indices. As a result, equity markets saw greater outflows, which slowed the deposits growth in banks," Bansal added. Industry players suggested that many have also diverted their matured fixed deposits towards equity market investments. Small-cap funds remain the apple of investors’ eyesMutual fund (MFs) investments remained upbeat over the past one year. Lured by good returns from stock markets and several new fund offers (NFOs) getting rolled out, fresh inflows into MFs continued since October last year. The assets under management for equity MFs breached the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in Gujarat in March 2020 itself, according to data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). In September, AUM for equity MFs stood at a whopping Rs 1.31 lakh crore in Gujarat. "For the past one year, small-cap and mid-cap mutual funds have outperformed other asset classes by a huge margin. Small-cap funds have delivered almost double the returns on investment within just a year," said Tejas Shukla, founder-director of a city-based financial advisory firm. Investors who had stalled capital expenditures had surplus funds. At the same time, young professionals were saving money through systematic investment plans (SIPs), causing SIP inflows to touch record highs. "SIP inflows in India touched a record high. While professionals began saving up, many new demat accounts were opened, including those by youngsters. As a result, the overall inflows in mutual funds surged and with market indices touching new highs, the returns were phenomenal, luring more investors," said Jayesh Vithalani, a city-based financial consultant. Faith in gold persists despite negative returnsGold remained to be the preferred asset class over the past two years and delivered a handsome 33% return last year. However, this year, as the pandemic-induced uncertainty was tamed with vaccine rollout and improvement in economic sentiment, gold prices pared some of the gains. Indian gold prices underwent a further correction with a reduction in basic customs duty on gold to 7.5%. As a result, the yellow metal ended up yielding a negative return of 4% since last Diwali. Despite reduced returns this year, gold continues to be a safe haven for many investors, suggest industry estimates. "People paid off their debts having sold gold they had accumulated over years or availed gold loans to meet emergency expenditures," said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). The demand for gold bars and coins is running high this festive season, indicated jewellers and bullion traders. Gold price stood at Rs 49,500 per 10 gram on October 27 – down by Rs 3,300 against last year’s Diwali when prices stood at Rs 52,800 per 10 gram on November 14, 2020. "Even though gold prices are much lower as compared to last year, investors have held on to their investments as they’re looking at long-term gains. Not just physical gold, demand has remained good for sovereign gold bonds too," said Jigar Soni, president, IBJA – Gujarat chapter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/equity-mutual-funds-trump-gold/articleshow/87408772.cms||Niyati Parikh

Heavy rain and floods caused due to cyclones had affected the state’s cropped area severely this year, estimated at over 55 lakh hectare of cropped area, which is nearly 45% of the area under agriculture in the state. Site surveys have been completed for 33.5 lakh applications and insurance has been calculated for 16 lakh claims, which is roughly coming to Rs 923 crore. The scheme, which is losing popularity, received 84.04 lakh applications from farmers to insure crops for this year’s kharif season. According to the scheme, a large chunk of the insurance premium is shared by state and Centre, farmers only have to pay 2% for most crops and 5% for cash crops.  This year, the premium comes to around Rs 4,512 crore, of which Rs 440 crore is the farmers’ share, while the state has paid Rs 973 crore and the Centre’s share was around Rs 898 crore. Insurance companies have not started disbursing payouts and the state has warned them of strict action if the money is not credited to farmers’ account before Diwali. “Although claims of 16 lakh applications have been finalised amounting to Rs 923 crore, disbursement has been made to merely 12,000 farmers, which amounts to Rs 7.86 crore. We issued a notice to all five insurance companies warning them of strict action if payouts are not done before Diwali,” said a senior agriculture commissionerate official. In a letter issued to the companies, agriculture commissioner Dheeraj Kumar said, “Delay in disbursing insurance amounts not only defeats the purpose and objective of PMFBY but also shows profiteering and money-making tendencies of insurance companies.” The scheme had over one crore applications last year and even though Rs 1,114 crore was finalised as payouts for losses, insurance companies only disbursed Rs 842 crore. The state government has taken up the issue with the central government. The agriculture department has also filed an FIR against one insurance company for delay in carrying out panchamas of affected areas. The state government has announced compensation towards crop losses as per NDRF norms and allocated Rs 10,500 crore for it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govt-warns-insurance-firms-on-payouts-for-farmers/articleshow/87410422.cms||Bhavika Jain

The incident took place on Tuesday but came to light on Thursday after his family members conducted the victim’s last rites. Ranga is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. The victim, Sree Ranga Aravapalli (54), from Andhra Pradesh, was stalked by the 27-year-old accused, Jekai Reid-John, from Parx Casino in Pennsylvania after the former won 10,000 dollars.

The message gained prominence as Microsoft co-founder Gates has been at the forefront of vaccination programme against Covid-19 ever since the pandemic disrupted lives and livelihoods across the globe. When Times Verified team scrutinized the message, it was revealed that it was an excerpt from a satirical article published on August 29, 2021, in Daily Expose – a website. The article read: “In an often anguished 19-minute televised speech, Gates said: “We made a terrible mistake. We wanted to protect people against a dangerous virus. But it turns out the virus is much less dangerous than we thought. And the vaccine is far more dangerous than anyone imagined.” Though the website carried a disclaimer stating that the article was satire, many people believed it to be true.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Covid orphans get aid, guardians too||Vijayawada: Little Ramesh (name changed) was abandoned by his uncles soon after his parents succumbed to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ramesh was one of the many Covid-19 orphans, who were deserted by their extended families, and rescued by the police during the Operation Muskaan when the lockdown was on. But, after the Central and the state government announced financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each to the children, who lost their parents during the pandemic, many families have come forward to adopt them. The Andhra Pradesh government has identified 237 children orphaned due to the pandemic as eligible for the financial assistance under the PM Cares for children scheme. The beneficiaries were picked up by district collectors. The abandoned children are now back with their extended families thanks to the financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh. The data released by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), however, shows that the state has 322 children, who had lost both parents and 7,188 children, who have lost one parent due to Covid-19. Around 550 of them are infants. A majority of Covid-19 orphans are studying in government schools. State officials clarify that only 237 orphans were selected as beneficiaries as the PM Cares for children scheme is applicable only to those children, who had lost their parents between March 11, 2020 and December 31, 2021, and that the beneficiary should be less than 18 years old. Officials said many of these children were initially abandoned by their extended family members until the central and the state governments announced Rs 10 lakh and other benefits for them. “The issue of children orphaned due to Covid-19 was not noticed till Operation Muskaan was conducted in 2020 and 2021. During that time, we noticed many orphans were either abandoned or neglected by the extended family members even when we tried to convince them,” a senior official with the state women and child welfare department told TOI. District-wise data shows that majority of orphaned children happen to be in Visakhapatnam followed by East Godavari and Anantapur districts. On the other hand, officials are facing issues with false claims and forgery in this regard. On June 11, cops arrested a man for allegedly forging a fake birth certificate to claim an orphaned girl’s Covid-19 ex gratia from the government, under Gannavaram police station limits. The accused identified as Eshwara Rao even collected the amount from Krishna district collector and later officials verified it as fake. To their shock, inquiry revealed that Rao was the actual father of the child and had given her to his sister Patnala Bhagya Lakshmi, who couldn’t bear children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/covid-orphans-get-aid-guardians-too/articleshow/87410426.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Kolkata||After HC order, high-rises issue fresh notice, ban firecrackers||Kolkata: Housing complexes and high-rises across the city were prompt in sending out fresh notices, banning bursting of firecrackers on premises, in keeping with the Calcutta High Court order that has prohibited the sale, purchase and use of all fireworks till the end of the year. Most residential complexes in the city had earlier issued a notice, designating spots on the campuses for people to gather and light permitted firecrackers. Revoking this notice, new ones were issued, saying no one should burst firecrackers on the premises. The notices also sternly mentioned that if any resident was found violating the order and got arrested, the committees would not be responsible. In many housing complexes, Covid cases have started making an appearance and so, stricter restrictions are being brought in for Kali Puja and Diwali, keeping health hazards in mind. According to the complexes, security guards will be assigned to keep an eye on the greens and other open spaces. They will also keep an eye on the balconies where kids often light fireworks. Notices clearly mentioned that the ban was on all kinds of fireworks and there was nothing in the “permitted” category this time, and so, family members should themselves follow the rule as well as counsel children about this. All terraces will be kept locked to stop any resident from climbing up to burst crackers there. However, as children might be disappointed, the committees are organising physical and virtual events to lift their spirit. At South City Residency, the committee had selected space for bursting crackers but the fresh notice said that no one should be seen bursting a single cracker anywhere inside the complex as police would be on the round. “However, we have arranged for some karaoke music in the greens where kids can perform and there will be food stalls. But we will keep a strict watch on distancing, mask use and sanitising norms,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of the complex. Three Covid cases have been reported at South City Residency and people are tense. Asim Dutta, secretary of Lakeview Housing Complex, said, “We were prompt in sending out a new notice, revoking the earlier order. We will now depend on the festival committee to think up something to entertain the children,” Dutta said. The Facebook page of Siddha Pines will go live on Diwali, where children will showcase their talent. “Terraces will be locked so that no one can go up there with firecrackers,” said Manav Mehra, president. In most complexes, Kali Puja will be a much small affair this time and pandals with be open on three sides. “We will allow very small numbers of people inside the pandal for pushpanjali, and that too, only after thermal checking and sanitising. A watch will be kept on the number of people in and around the pandal throughout the day and night,” Mehra said. Siddha Pines has already had a Covid case and is on alert. If the number of Covid cases rises, fresh ban on food delivery boys going up to flats will be brought in, many committees have decided.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-hc-order-high-rises-issue-fresh-notice-ban-firecrackers/articleshow/87408803.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Hyderabad||Green crackers to light up Diwali in AP/T||Vijayawada/Hyderabad: It could well be a less polluted Diwali for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh next week. This, with over 90% traders sticking to green crackers this time around, keeping with strict rules of the state. While the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has categorically instructed revellers to stay away from banned crackers –following Supreme Court’s order regulating the use of firecrackers -- the same is likely to apply to people of AP as well. In 2020, the government there permitted only green fireworks for Diwali and traders are still following the same guidelines. Barring last year’s leftover goods, dealers across the two states say they have stocked up only on green crackers this year. “All the stock we received this year is eco-friendly,” said K Venu Gopal, general secretary, Telangana Fire Works Dealers Association (TFWDA), who also owns wholesale shops in Karmanghat and Malkajgiri. He said Telangana gets about 90% to 95% of its stock from Sivakasi and the remaining from north India. But this ‘green’ Diwali might come at a price. According to traders, while these crackers are expected to cut down on pollution by 35% to 40%, buyers have to cough up 8% to 18% for them. hat is, however, unlikely to dull the sales. “Even though they are 15% more expensive (on an average) than conventional crackers, there is tremendous demand for it,” said N Malleswara Rao, a wholesale trader from Vijayawada. And this is sure to come as good news for the market that suffered serious losses in 2020, owing to Covid-19. “We had to suffer a lot last year. We are hoping that more people will come out to buy green crackers this time,” said Sandeep M, a retailer from Hyderabad. Green brigade happy The environment-conscious are delighted with stores stocking up on green crackers. This is a heartening change that’s brought about by science. I hope the government ensures that only green fireworks are used everywhere,” said K Maheswar Reddy, secretary of Prayavarana Rakshana Vedika from Vijayawada. Conventional fireworks usually contain high quantities of aluminum, lead, arsenic and other chemicals which increase PM 2.5 levels substantially. High decibel sound emitting from the fireworks is also a major concern highlighted even by the National Green Tribunal. Last year, we saw a significant improvement in air quality because of the green crackers rule. We should keep that in mind and promote the use of these crackers this time too,” said E E Murali, environment engineer, Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/green-crackers-to-light-up-diwali-in-ap/t/articleshow/87408787.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Hyderabad||Child labour to professor in Canada: Chinnaiah Jangam||HYDERABAD: From turning a child labour at the tender age of of four to becoming a tenured professor at one of the top universities in Canada, Chinnaiah Jangam, son of a jogini (a devadasi), has overcome all obstacles to reach the pinnacle of success and, more importantly, fulfil his mother’s wish —getting formal education. Jangam, who tasted poverty at a young age, said that back in his childhood his ambition was to escape from poverty and realised that he could achieve it only through education. He said it was also his mother’s dream to get him educated as his grandparents, uncles, aunts and others in the family worked as bonded labourers. “I was ridiculed for joining a school,” Jangam told TOI. “Getting insulted was an everyday affair in childhood. People took pleasure in putting me down, reminding me time and again that I am the son of a jogini and should not waste time studying.” A professor of history at Carleton University, Ottawa, Jangam said that he lost his mother when he was in class 9 and that her death was the hardest moment in his life. “I had to seek alms to collect Rs 5,000 to cremate my mother. Most of my relatives gave some money for the cremation and broke ties with our family — my three-year-old sister and me,” said Jangam, who studied at social welfare school and later at government colleges. He said that his mother was ‘married to a deity’ when she had polio and made a jogini (a practice banned now). “Once a woman is made a jogini, she loses control on her life. Although married to a deity, they can’t enter a temple as they are from a lower caste, untouchables. They have to be available for everyone in the village. My mother was forced to beg in front of the temple. She was exploited, did many odd jobs to support our family,” he said and added that he too had to work as a construction worker and farm labourer while studying. Jangam said that he had to send his sister to an orphanage, from where she started her schooling, and he continued his education. “This was the only way we both could study,” he said. An alumnus of University of Hyderabad, Jangam said he was fortunate to get some amazing teachers and friends in life. “Some teachers used to even give me used clothes. In fact, until my post-graduation, I mostly wore hand-me-down clothes,” he added. He said that he refrained from sharing details about his background from intermediate and only after completing education and reaching a certain stage in life, he had started to talk about his roots again as he wanted people to know anyone can achieve anything. “Even now, I have to face insults sometimes, but they are mostly subtle. But, I am in a happy place now. I am proud of who I am,” he said. Jangam said that he is currently working on his mother’s memoir and a book on the history of caste in India. “I want to be remembered for my writings on the suffering of people from my community,” he added. Jangam did MPhil from Jawaharlal Nehru University and PhD from the University of London. He also taught at a university in the US and Osmania University. A video about him was recently tweeted by politician Konda Vishweshwar Reddy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/jangam-child-labour-to-prof-in-canada/articleshow/87410448.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Kochi||HC directive on Vaduthala bund brings relief||Kochi: The Kerala High Court’s directions asking the state government and district administration to remove the sedimentation which created a ‘temporary bund’ in the Periyar at Vaduthala has come as a great relief to the residents living along the backwaters of Kochi. The temporary bund, formed of the sediments left from the remains of the construction of the Vallarpadam bridge, over the years has led to obstruction in the flow of Periyar from Aluva to Vallarapadam. With the annual heavy rainfall, flooding of homes on the banks has become a regular feature since 2018. Despite the cleaning of the connecting canals into the city, the bund results in water-logging and flooding at several places by the river bank and backwaters. It was just a couple of months ago that the residents living on the banks of Periyar from Aluva to Vallarpadam formed a forum and petitioned minister and Kalamassery MLA P Rajeeve. Following it the irrigation department officials submitted a report to the government and the court that the study by Kerala engineering research institute had found that the deposition included remnants of concrete piers and drain pipes. This obstruction has also resulted in blockage of nearly 17 of 19 gaps among the 20 pillars of Vallarpadam railway bridge. If the entire width of 780m is desilted, it would increase the natural flow of Periyar to the sea and avoid flooding and water logging in nearby places like Kalamassery, Eloor, Muppathadam and Aluva. The court had asked the authorities to clear the sedimentation before the next monsoon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hc-directive-on-vaduthala-bund-brings-relief/articleshow/87377018.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Speaking to reporters in Pune, Raut said, “No government can be formed without Congress, which is a major and deeply-rooted party in the country. Congress is the main opposition party too. Others are regional parties.” Queried about political strategist Prashant Kishor’s reported statement that BJP will remain in power for many decades, Raut said, “BJP claims that it is the world’s biggest party. If the world’s biggest party loses elections, they will become an opposition party. For example, in Maharashtra, the BJP is the main opposition party with 105 MLAs,” he said. The BJP’s estranged ally, Shiv Sena, shares power with NCP and Congress in Maharashtra. On the upcoming Assembly elections in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Raut said, “Presently we are focusing in Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa. There is still time for UP elections.

The accused, Arvind Bajaj, did not flee the scene. Instead, he dialled 100 and asked police to come down to his residence, where he surrendered. Police found his wife, Priyanka Bajaj (44), unconscious. Their daughter, Advika Bajaj (18), who neighbours said, was preparing for NEET, was found lying in the room with stab wounds. The two were taken to SSKM Hospital, where Priyanka was declared dead. Advika, doctors said, had lost a lot of blood. According to joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma, Arvind worked at his father-in-law’s cement business at Rabindra Sarani for the time being. He had been in a financial crisis during the pandemic, sources said. “A protracted matrimonial dispute seems to be the reason. We will probe all angles. Arvind was at the residence,” said Sharma. Police said they received Arvind’s call around 7.30pm, following which they reached his third-floor flat. “There was blood all around the victim. He apparently stabbed Priyanka with a sharp object, probably a kitchen knife, after the couple, married for close to two decades, had an altercation. Their daughter tried to stop her father but got stabbed,” police said. Advika was studying for her NEET, when she heard her parents arguing. “The accused has stopped talking and seems to be in deep shock. What we have gathered is from neighbours and there are several unanswered questions. We are trying to speak to their family and will question Arvind at the Rabindra Sarobar PS,” said DC (south-east) Sudip Sarkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/man-kills-wife-injures-daughter-calls-cops-to-home/articleshow/87408844.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Jaipur||One held in e-challan fraud case||Jaipur: The special investigating team (SIT) of Jaipur police on Saturday arrested a 26-year-old kingpin in an e-challan fraud case for forging documents to embezzle money. Police listed the accused as one Joginder Kumar alias Yogendra Kumar, a resident of Mataji Road near Jobner in Jaipur. According to police, the SIT arrested Joginder after his role as one of the key participants in the conspiracy was established. Sources informed TOI that the accused colluded with other suspects to forge e-challans of sale deeds worth several lakhs and pocketed the money before it could be processed and deposited as per the rules. Police said that an FIR was registered at the Bani Park on October 1, when a series of inconsistencies were discovered in the alleged misuse of the online government receipts accounting system or e-GRAS which resulted in revenue losses. As soon as the first FIR was filed, additional commissioner, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba constituted the SIT which is led by additional DCP (crime), Karan Sharma. The preliminary examination hinted at the collusion of staff posted at the sub-registrar offices in the city with middlemen, deed writers and former staffers. The SIT officials are trying to corroborate how the entire racket operated despite a heavily regularised e-challan system and multi-level verification process entrusted to weed out malpractices. “What we have learned so far from Joginder is that he was in contact with several people including some former and current staffers posted at sub-registrar office number two. He forged the e-challans through online editing software,” the official said. “We have received multiple documents from the stamp department to begin our investigation. The accused were found to be using the same recipient of the e-challan for multiple sale deeds registration,” said the official, adding that more suspects will be quizzed soon in the case. “Some of the staffers should have crossed checked the receipts with the listings made on the e-GRAS software, but they did not,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/one-held-in-e-challan-fraud-case/articleshow/87408850.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All ‘green crackers’ have heavy toxic metals, says Awaaz foundation||MUMBAI: After Awaaz Foundation found only one cracker out of 12 samples of ‘green crackers’ flouting noise levels, it said almost all contained heavy toxic metals such as mercury, lithium, lead and arsenic. These elements can induce multiple organ damage, even at low levels of exposure. They are classified as human carcinogens (known or probable), according to international environmental protection agencies and International Agency for Research on Cancer. They also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. “The foundation also got commonly available ‘green crackers’ tested for heavy metal content with the help of two independent laboratories. The test results are shocking, as both labs found they contain dangerous and banned metals,” foundation convenor Sumaira Abdulali told chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a letter. Abdulali said independent results show that these green crackers are violating Supreme Court orders that firecrackers must not contain antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead in any form. She demanded that since conducting tests from independent private laboratories was expensive for an NGO to sustain, the government should order such tests in the interest of environment, human and animal health. Recently, mandatory QR codes which can track emission levels and are published alongside NEERI certification on packs of green crackers have been found to be fake by the foundation. Many people trying to verify them through an app developed by NEERI, the government agency which developed chemical formula for green crackers, found them to be fake. “These facts were placed before SC while hearing an application by Arjun Gopal on Friday. SC, while admitting the foundation’s test results, directed a probe into fake green crackers and held senior government officers responsible for enforcing it,” she said in her letter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-all-green-crackers-have-heavy-toxic-metals-says-awaaz/articleshow/87410468.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The level-I teaching jobs are for primary classes while level-2 is for upper primary classes. Right next to the protesting unemployed youths under the banner of Rajasthan Berozgar Akakrit Mahasangh (RBAM), these graduates with a bridge course in Basic School Training Certificate (BSTC) are forced to protest over a government’s decision of allowing BEd degree holders to apply for Grade III (Level-I), which was exclusively reserved for BSTC students. These graduates contend that BEd graduates hold a better chance of cracking recruitment exams as they are professionally trained for teaching jobs for two years. They also contended that when bachelors in education degree holders can apply for a teaching post at all levels, the provision of including BEd graduates is an attack on their job. “When it is clear that BSTC graduates can apply for Grade-III level I jobs which allows them to teach in primary classes, then why the government has allowed BEd students eligible in the level-I jobs, which were exclusively reserved for them,” asked protestor Samrajya Singh. The protestors also contended that the BSTC bridge course is done by students who cannot afford BEd courses. “I have done the government-approved bridge course in BSTC after taking a loan aiming to get a government job. Now, the government wants us to compete with those who have done their professional course in teaching. It is like the government has questioned its own approved course over the other making it a mockery of all of us,” said Suresh Meena, a protesting student. The protest will continue until our demands are met by the government else we will start boycotting the political leaders. Upen Yadav of RBAM says that government should provide them with a feasible solution else the situation will become worst.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bstc-says-inclusion-of-bed-grads-in-grade-iii-jobs-unfair/articleshow/87408885.cms||---

TMC has began campaigning for the upcoming 2022 Goa assembly polls with the slogan, ‘Goenchi Navi Sakal’ (Goa’s new dawn). “To protect Goa’s culture, we do not need some third person. Goans and journalists here are capable to protect Goa’s culture, identity and environment. There is no need for someone else to come and bring a new dawn,” Sawant said while addressing journalists at the Goa Union of Journalists (GUJ) annual awards ceremony. He said that during his two-and-a-half years tenure, he has not hesitated to withdraw his decisions if it was felt that they would not be in the interest of Goa and Goans. “Until we do not point out the faults in society and in politics, they cannot be corrected. The pillar of journalism has to serve this function. During my term as CM, I have not ignored criticism and I have made improvements wherever required. Even if I had to go back on my decisions at times, I have done it without thinking of it as a personal setback for me,” said Sawant. Sawant said that he was disheartened after attending the Swayampurna Yuva programme on Saturday morning in Ponda. “Among a crowd of 2,000 youngsters, not a single one was able to name the portal where information of all 122 schemes is available. I appeal to journalists to help us take the benefits of these schemes to the last person in society,” he said. “Someone said my goal is 22 seats in 2022. I know we will definitely achieve it. But making Goa swayampurna (self-reliant) is my dream.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sawant-slams-didi-says-goans-do-not-need-an-outsider-to-bring-new-dawn/articleshow/87411388.cms||---

Recognising that residents were doubly weighed down by office work and housework, certain housing societies devised unique events to lighten the mood on weekends. Kesar Harmony society in Sector 6 of Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, arranged several fun activities which residents joined from the safety of their balconies. Deepa Duraisamy of Kesar’s Covid task force, said people still fondly recall those days. “We started by organising a singalong event. Two of us would anchor from a podium in the compound, circulate lyrics on WhatsApp, and all families would step out on their balconies to sing. This programme was received so well that we followed up with an Antakshari competition between the six buildings of our society,” she said. Neighbouring buildings would hear happy voices singing at Kesar, and actually sought tips to replicate the show. For half an hour every evening, music was played on speakers on request. Cultural coordinators Ashish Sharma and Amit Parnandiwar compiled English playlists for youngsters, and ghazals for elders who were nursing a drink or two. Housie games were held online. Kesar Harmony also had online ludo and sudoku tournaments. “People looked forward to weekends like picnics,” said Duraisamy. The society used Google forms to arrange groceries. Dr Neetu Sambhar led volunteers who cooked meals for Covid-affected families. Over in Goregaon, residents of the 500 flats of Lodha Fiorenza society had come out on their balconies to beat thaalis and clap for medical workers at PM Narendra Modi’s call. “We repeated the exercise for in-house staff and clapped for them,” said Anupama Easwaran, a member of the society’s Covid task force. Fiorenza accommodated 20-25 of its staff in the society clubhouse with large fans and mattresses, arranged meals in a central kitchen, and provided vaccination. Society members, who were initially upset when maids were debarred, continued to pay full salaries. Some distributed Diwali bonus as well. The Ghasitaram family of sweetmeat makers lives here too, and sourced grocery supplies for members. The society did witness one fatality and several cases of Covid. Basic needs of affected families were met by neighbours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-balcony-parties-lift-residents-staffs-spirits/articleshow/87410533.cms||---

The exam, which was supposed to be held between May and August this year, was delayed due to the second wave of the pandemic. The exams were rescheduled from August and are being held in three phases. “The exams are being conducted at a frantic pace to ensure there is no further delay. A delay in exams causes huge stress to students. Even the faculties of health science colleges affiliated to MUHS are helping during theory and practical exams. They are also undertaking assessment of the answer scripts quickly,” Dr Ajit Pathak, the varsity’s controller of examination, told TOI. Nitin Karmalkar, the varsity’s acting VC, and Dr Kalidas Chavan, the registrar, have been guiding the exam department in conducting them. Pathak said Phase I of the exam involving PG degree and diploma of all health courses, super-specialty courses and final-year MBBS was completed last month, and the results were also declared. “In Phase II, final-year UG exams of all health science courses and modern mid-level service provider exams, was completed on October 8. Currently, the examinees are appearing for their practicals. Phase III of the exam related to first-, second- and third-year UG exams are currently on. We are confident by the end of November we will be able to complete the entire exam process and declare the results for almost all courses,” added Pathak. He said completion of the exams would also enable the state to have many more doctors in hospitals in case of a third wave. Meanwhile, the new MUHS VC, Lt Gen (Dr) Madhuri Kanitkar, will take charge on November 1. University chancellor and state governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had appointed her the new VC of MUHS in July this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-muhs-hopes-to-finish-summer-21-exams-in-nov/articleshow/87410575.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Addressing the media, deputy inspector general of police (DIG) B G Shekhar Patil of Nashik range said anti-social elements procured the firearms from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. He said the police are taking strict against people found smuggling these firearms into Nashik range. The police have registered offences against 48 people under the Arms Act for carrying firearms. Apart from the country-made pistols, the police from the five units of the range — comprising Nashik Rural, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar — also seized 84 cartridges and two magazines. Over the past two months, the Nashik range police also seized 64 swords and 21 sharp weapons.  Patil said, “Two months ago after taking charge as the DIG of Nashik range, I visited all the districts and units under my jurisdiction to take stock of the crime scenario. During the process, it was found that there was a menace of illegal weapons in all the districts and people were drawing dangerous weapons like firearms and swords over petty arguments. This is not a good sign and weapons should not reach the hands of young people, so the heads of all the police units were sensitised about stepping up intelligence gathering of illegal weapons and take action against the people concerned.” The DIG also has set up his squad to detect such illegal businesses and take action against the people. He said the firearms recovered by the police were purchased for around Rs 25,000 and they appear extremely sophisticated. Meanwhile, in the past two months, the police also seized a huge quantity of ganja worth Rs 4.28 crore from across the five districts, brown sugar of Rs 7.50 lakh and charas of Rs 1.44 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-range-45-firearms-seized-in-2-months/articleshow/87404486.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Abdul Rahman, 24, of Manikyavilakam near Beemapalli is the one who has received the sentence. Judge R Jayakrishnan, who delivered the sentence, has also imposed a penalty of Rs 1 lakh on the culprit. Failure to pay the penalty will result in extension of the sentence for one more year. The penalty amount must be paid to the victim. According to special public prosecutor R S Vijay Mohan, the crime took place in the year 2018 when the victim was a class X student. The culprit was the elder brother of the victim's close friend. As per prosecution charge, the culprit lured the girl into a relationship and sexually exploited her on promise of marrying her. ''The culprit used to teach at a local madrassa then. Since he enjoyed respect in the society owing to his job, the girl believed his promise,'' the prosecutor said. But, later he broke up with her, going back from the promise of marriage. Following this, the girl went to his house and threatened to commit suicide. This led to a commotion and thus the issue came to public knowledge. Consequently, the police registered a Pocso case and arrested Abdul Rahman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/man-gets-25-years-ri-in-pocso-case/articleshow/87377181.cms||---

On Friday, we vaccinated around 12,000 people,” said a health official. The dive in Trichy district at 621 locations recorded a poor response, with only 65,585 people getting vaccinated. Major vaccination centres including Kalaiarangam hall saw a deserted ambience. Most of the people who took the jab on Saturday were awaiting the second dose. Although Trichy Corporation arranged for more than 100 mobile teams, the response from the public was lower than anticipated. “Only after we canvassed that vaccination was safe, a section of slum dwellers agreed to get the jab. Even the prizes announced and awarded for those who took the vaccines in the recent mega camps failed to influence the people,” a medical officer said. Meanwhile, in Tiruneveli, around 34,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated while in Kanyakumari, 49,720 received the jab. Health officials observed that compared to the first few mega drives, it is becoming difficult to get the public to come forward to take the vaccine. “Public have lost the sense of urgency to get vaccinated especially as Covid-19 cases in most districts are very low,” said a health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/7th-mega-vaccination-drive-turns-a-damp-squib/articleshow/87409020.cms||---

Sathappan Kumar, 43, who was employed to make food deliveries, sustained injuries in a road accident in Dubai which left him suffering from quadriplegia. Though he was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Dubai from September 11, he required treatment and rehabilitation for a longer period for recovery. With his family hailing from a humble background and his wife and two sons in Madurai, Sathappan was unable to afford his treatment. Dr Shyamala Kumar at NMC Royal Hospital, where Sathappan was being treated, brought the issue to the notice of her father and social activist, V Santhanam, who in turn reached out to Tamil Nadu chief secretary V Irai Anbu. “The chief secretary responded in a speedy manner and ensured the necessary arrangements for the patient to be brought to Madurai for treatment. He was subsequently brought to Cochin and from there to Madurai by road by Friday,” said Santhanam. Dr Shyamala Kumar, who co-ordinated the repatriation efforts from Dubai, said NMC Royal Hospital vice-president Dr Ashish Kumar Jaiswal ensured all necessary treatment for the patient free of cost. Sathappan, who is currently under treatment and rehabilitation at GRH with his wife Selvi by his side, is thankful to have reached Madurai and also provided treatment free of cost. “It was really heartbreaking for me as both my arms and legs have been paralysed. The treatment in Dubai gave me some hope to cling on to. Hopefully, I will recover soon,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/tn-govt-airlifts-paralysed-worker-from-dubai/articleshow/87409030.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Saraf in his letter has suggested to regularise these colonies on the lines of Prithviraj Nagar as the matter of these colonies has been stuck for more than 40 years and more than 650 house owners are suffering. Till date, the process of regularisation of Lalkothi in Jaipur and its adjoining Krishna Nagar I, Krishna Nagar II, Friends Colony, Indrapuri, Greater Kailash, Kailash Vihar, Everest Colony, Satya Vihar, Raghu Vihar, Laxmi Colony, Saraswati Colony, Salt Colony and Dev Colony has not even started. It was claimed that most of the landowners in these colonies had deposited regularisation fee in the year 2006, but after hearing a petition in the Supreme Court in the year 2011, the Supreme Court canceled those orders of the state government. The letter reads, “During the state government’s six month long campaign, an announcement has been made to issue the lease deeds to colonies whose matter was pending in the court. The chief minister should issue directions to expedite regularisation.” A high-power committee constituted by the state government in September 1976 decided to regularise Everest Colony and Salt Government Housing Cooperative Society. The state government had fixed the regularization fee of Rs 21.55 paise at that time. On February 2, 1990, the state government issued an revised order and asked the plot owners to deposit regularisation fee after paying 12 per cent interest. However, even after the orders were issued, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) did not start the regularisation process. Following this, five people moved the high court. The court had directed to issue the lease deeds to those five people. “Out of total 850 houses in 13 colonies, lease deeds have been given to 258 plot owners. The remaining plot holders have deposited the regularisation amount.” Meanwhile a JDA official said the proposal has been forwarded to high authorities. The decision will be taken after the nod.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-mla-writes-to-cm-wants-13-colonies-to-be-regularised/articleshow/87409062.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The minor son of the woman constable, who was recently released on bail, has been putting up at a city child shelter since last month. Officials claimed that the boy was healthy though he missed his mother initially. They also claimed that the minor boy had to be accommodated in a child shelter as the boy’s aged maternal grandparents were unable to take care of him properly and his father was also absent from the scene. "The child’s mother has written to us asking for her son’s custody, but we need his father’s opinion before we take any decision," said an official of child welfare committee in Jaipur. "The father needs to reply to the notice by November 2," the official said. The Special Operations Group (SOG) had registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, based on the obscene videos of the two cops in the presence of a six-year-old boy in a swimming pool that went viral on social media.

This is part of BJP’s plan to form 10,000 FPOs across the country. Most of the FPOs will come in farmer-dominated districts like Hanumangarh, Ganganagar, Sikar, Alwar and Jaipur. Every FPO will have a minimum of 300 growers. “PM Narendra Modi’s schemes for farmers have transformed their lives by providing them protective covers, financial support and institutional changes would lead to double of their income,” said Poonia. The workshop was attended by several BJP leaders and Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary. BJP is trying hard to popularise the FPO scheme in states where farmers are protesting farm laws including Rajasthan. “The FPO will get all assistance from the Union government and its aim is to make farmers independent and to provide necessary human resources to guide them on important subjects,” said Choudhary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-set-to-float-farmers-produce-organisations/articleshow/87409077.cms||---

The first Sikh delegation met Modi on Friday evening in Rome when the cops were searching north Italian Sikh houses for the protesters. One of the Italian Sikhs said on the condition of anonymity: "There are many people like me who have lived in Italy for more than 10 years but never been able to visit homes or relatives in Punjab because our names are on the visa blacklist. If Modi scraps this blacklist, it will help him win the hearts of NRI Sikhs." Modi is in Rome for the G-20 summit from October 29 to 31 on the invitation of Italy’s PM, Mario Draghi, and his next stop is Glasgow in the UK for COP 26 Climate Summit from November 1 to 2 on the invitation of British PM, Boris Johnson. Sukhdev Singh Kang of Brescia, Italy, who was among the Sikhs who met Modi in Rome, confirmed that they had requested him to use his influence on Italy for the registration of Sikhism as a religion in that country. Kang, who is also president of the Indian Sikh community in Italy, denied discussing any blacklist or anti-Modi protests. He is the one who bought the family house of Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Lusiana, Italy. He said: "Once, the Covid-19 pandemic is over, I plan to turn the house into a museum." UK Sikh Federation chairman Amrik Singh said his group will protest against Modi at George Square, Glasgow, on the eve of COP 26, where more than 100 world leaders will gather. He said foreign Sikh environmentalists supported the Indian farmers’ Delhi agitation against three central agri-marketing laws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/some-italian-sikhs-seek-modis-help-while-others-oppose-him/articleshow/87409079.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Kolkata||Schools start training teachers for hybrid class||KOLKATA: When teachers walk into class from November 16, they will carry their laptops, earphones and other smart gadgets to facilitate new-age teaching. Teachers are being trained for hybrid classrooms where a group of students will be physically present while another set will be attending classes online. Teachers will not be able to sit or stand wherever they want in class during lessons since moving away from a particular spot will mean students attending the class virtually will not be able to see them. Teachers will have to always be facing the laptop camera at the right angle. On the other hand, sharing videos or teaching with the help of audio-visual tools have now become routine in online classes. But teachers will have to modify those lessons so as to include the students who are actually in the classrooms. Screens are now being set up in classrooms for projections and cameras are being installed at different angles so that the interaction between those in class and those at home can happen as “break-out” sessions to punctuate lectures. This will be a way for teachers to see how much the class has followed. “This is going to be a whole new experience in teaching and it will not be easy. A teacher will have to grab the attention of both the online and offline candidates simultaneously. The professional help that we have hired will train teachers about voice modulation and throw so that their voices do not trail off. They will also be taught about synchronising teaching materials for both kinds of pupils in front of them, about the right angle to sit or stand for maximum visibility, and learning to speak into the microphone from a certain distance,” said John Bagul, principal of South City International School. Training of teachers will start from the beginning of November when they will have to start going back to school daily. Many schools have already started asking teachers to attend webinars on how to teach in hybrid classrooms being conducted by learning platform management experts. “Hybrid classroom teaching requires mastering of certain techniques and the transition from online classes to this will be a challenge for teachers. Hence, we are making them attend webinars before they come back to campus on November 1. After that, special hands-on training will be given,” said Father Rodney Borneo, principal of St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar. Some schools have activated their in-house IT teams to help train the teachers on the angles and ranges that the cameras and microphones can catch. “There are inbuilt white boards and screen-sharing facilities on online meeting platforms, but the teacher has to know how to get the information transmitted to the students who are physically in the classroom. The teacher cannot be writing a lesson twice for the two different categories of students. Our IT and computer maintenance teams will be helping the teachers with these,” said John Stephen, acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/schools-start-training-teachers-for-hybrid-class/articleshow/87407414.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The newfound “asset label” has been luring Kutch youths like Nagji Rabari (25), a resident of Kanmer village of Rapar taluka to invest in a fleet of 40 camels in the last two years — animals bought all the way from Dwarka and Jamnagar districts too. But that was not so until five years ago, when camels literally proved to be ‘white elephants’ for breeders in the arid land. Nagji, son of a camel breeder, who used to drive commercial vehicles, had sold off their livestock five years ago, frustrated by the abominably low income camel milk fetched them. But, magic happened in the milk and spurred by a ‘new white revolution’ of sorts, camel milk sold at Rs 50 per litre, started fetching them anything between Rs 40,000 and 1 lakh every month. Good prices inspired Nagji, and many more like him, to invest into camels again. And many camel breeders of the nomad community purchased camels from Jamnagar, Patan and Rajasthan in the last one year. According to a rough estimate 170 camels were brought to Kutch in the last one year. Price of one camel is between Rs 35,000 and Rs 50,000 depending on the milk producing capacity. “When my father sold milk, he earned a paltry Rs 10-15 per litre from restaurant owners. But after Sarhad dairy started bulk procurement, we get Rs 50 per litre, which is a very profitable profession at present.” And so did Sura Rabari from Beru village of Nakhatrana, who too realised the possibility of a good income and invested in 40 camels from Patan four months ago. “Out of 40, we sold a few. Only 100 camels have been brought to Nakhatrana taluka from other parts,” he said. “There are 18 youths who left other professions to join camel breeding after finding it lucrative. Even those who had sold off their fleet are now purchasing new milch camels,” said Mahendra Bhanani, camel programme coordinator of Sahjeevan, a voluntary organization.Some like Asha Rabrai of Daban village in Nakhatrana even sold off his cows to buy 15 camels recently. Sarpanch of Gagan village,Hira Rabari, who himself brought 40 camels and sold 15, said, “We have a cooperative structure which should give us loans at low interest to buy camels.” Meanwhile, India’s first co-operative society of camel breeders, which was formed a few years ago and now defunct, has been revived after milk started gaining local interest. The union created two milk collection centres and brought machinery to examine fat and other standards of the milk which it sells to Sarhad dairy. The dairy procures around 3,000 litres every day and pays Rs 51 per litre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/milk-income-lures-youths-to-restock-camels/articleshow/87407458.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Tourists duped through the website have claimed that the accused were using state government emblems to make the service appear authentic. The incident came to light after a resident of North 24 Parganas, Pradeep Haldar, reported the matter to the police recently. According to Haldar, a few years ago, the state transport department had launched a special helicopter service to Digha. The flights were to take off from the aerodrome in Behala. Flights were also proposed to Malda and Balurghat. However, the service was discontinued after a brief period. Spotting the opportunity, fraudsters floated fake agencies to offer the service that no longer existed. Haldar was one of the victims who tried to book helicopter tickets through this fake agency. Haldar and two of his friends had tried to book a flight to Digha and were asked to pay Rs 9,000. Though he claimed to have made the payment, the tickets did not arrive. He was then asked to pay another Rs 11,000 in insurance. When the tickets still did not arrive, he realised he had been duped. Haldar then complained to the cyber cell of Basirhat Police and the anti-fraud section of Kolkata Police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fraudsters-dupe-tourists-with-chopper-ride-promise/articleshow/87407445.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Boipara pins hopes on resumption of on-campus activities for biz revival||KOLKATA: The news of reopening of schools and colleges from next month has rekindled hope of a turnaround in fortunes in College Street’s boipara, which was badly hit by the lockdown last year followed by devastation unleashed by Cyclone Amphan. Traders in boipara are hopeful of brisk business as schools and colleges reopen gradually and on-campus activities resume and several competitive exams are bring conducted, fuelling demand for reference materials.  Boipara is a kilometre-long stretch in College Street flanked by hundreds of stalls of second-hand books, rare academic journals, fiction, maps and everything in between, making it the world’s biggest market of second-hand books. It is also the biggest market for books in the country. Battered by the pandemic, lockdowns, two cyclones and status quo in academics, leading to suspension of in-person classes and curtailment of syllabus, business in boipara had hit an all-time low. But now big bookstores as well as small store owners are busy replenishing stock after the news of campus reopening. “The news of reopening of schools and colleges is a very good one for those selling text books and reference books. Academics took the biggest hit and so did the book trade,” said Subhankar Dey of Dey’s Publishing. The fact that the two major boards will conduct offline examinations soon after reopening of schools and colleges has already increased footfalls in boipara. “Online classes were a stop-gap measure where even examinations could not be conducted properly. Now when two boards have announced that they will be conducting offline examinations, parents and students are coming to College Street to buy solved question papers and reference books. This has definitely provided an impetus to the business,” said Bimal Chandra Mondal, owner of a book stall near Calcutta University. Several small traders who sell books for students from the state board have been hit the hardest. “Unlike private English-medium schools, most government schools could not hold online classes because maximum students did not have the gadgets and internet connectivity. As a result, books were hardly sold, which meant complete collapse for our business. Even booksellers from districts did not purchase any books during this period. But we are hopeful of some business once schools start opening and classes are held like pre-pandemic times, “ said Tarak Bhanja, a stall owner in boipara.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/boipara-pins-hopes-on-resumption-of-on-campus-activities-for-biz-revival/articleshow/87407438.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Popular restaurants in star hotels, mostly enclosed, have gone out of favour due to the Covid pandemic, the increase in number of standalone eateries, be it on rooftops or having open spaces, have started to corner a large customer segment. “The trend is certainly not supporting the restaurants in the star hotels as people want to go out and try new things that they find in standalone restaurants. A significant number of guests stay in start hotels but prefer to eat outside,” said Surendra Singh Shahpura, of Hotel, Restaurants Association of Rajasthan.Shahpura said that there has been an increase in room occupancy, especially on week-ends, but the food and beverage segment has not gained as much. “Those hotels have open spaces have found demand for their food and beverage business,” he added. Echoing similar sentiments, Ranvijay Singh, another member of HRAR said that the city has over 4000 restaurants and the food delivery companies like Swiggy and Zomato have changed the preferences of some consumers.“Even guests staying in hotels are ordering food through Swiggy or Zomato. This is not a good sign for the hotels. There has to be some collective decision to discourage such practice,” said Singh. He said similar is the case with liquor. The hotels have paid large sums as liquor licence fees but the hotel bars are not getting the business they expected. A large number guests buy liquor from outside and consume in their rooms,” added Singh.Besides the fear of coronavirus and the high rates that one pays at the restaurants, the range of innovative food that one gets in the restaurants are also winning the customers.“The standalone restaurants are very alluring in terms of ambience. They also service very innovative food which the restaurants in the star hotels have lagged. But more than that currently, most of the visitors are price sensitive domestic travelers. They don’t want to cough up Rs 2000 or 2500 per plate of food. That’s why they go out even though they stay in the hotel,” said a hotelier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/standalone-restaurants-eat-into-food-biz-of-star-hotels/articleshow/87409098.cms||---

The bench comprising Justice MM Srivastava and Justice Farzand Ali gave these orders while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) citing the unavailability of medicines at the government-run cooperative medical shops. The petitioner stated in the PIL that pensioners were unable to get their medicines from the cooperative medical stores. "They spent hours in queues and finally they end up getting a reply on non-availability of medicines. While they are given a no-objection certificate (NOC) by these medical shops so that they can purchase the unavailable medicines from private chemists to claim the bills for reimbursements, the reimbursements too are not settled on time," the petitioner said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/ensure-essential-medicines-for-pensioners-hc-to-state/articleshow/87409092.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Gehlot: People ‘maibaap’ to decide next CM, forming Congress govt is important||Jaipur: In less than a month, chief minister Ashok Gehlot seems to have amended his statement about becoming Rajasthan CM for the fourth time after 2023 state elections. Addressing a public assembly in Bikaner district on Friday, Gehlot said, “Who becomes the CM fourth time is a different matter, but our aim should be that the Congress government gets formed for the fourth time.” The CM had gone to inspect “prashashan gaon ke sangh” (administration with the villages) camp in Bikaner district. At the launch of the same campaign in Jaipur on October 2, Gehlot had alluded that he would be the Rajasthan CM for the fourth time when the Congress government gets repeated in the 2023 elections. “I will make (Shanti) Dhariwal ji minister of the same department (urban development and housing). I’m declaring his portfolio today itself. He will be the UDH minister for the fourth time,” Gehlot had said, implying that he would be distributing portfolios for the fourth time as CM in the next Congress government as well. On Friday, Gehlot’s tenor appeared different. “You (people) made me the CM third time; it’s no less a thing. I realise and acknowledge that.” At this point, someone from the crowd shouted, “Chauthi baar bhi (fourth time again).” Gehlot smiled and responded, “Chauthi baar toh kya (what to say for the fourth time)… Maibaap toh aap baithe ho… (you are the guardians/deciders).” The CM’s statements assume significance in the context of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his loyalists repeatedly demanding a change of guard in the state. Since August 2020, Pilot was demanding greater share for his supporters in the Congress government through cabinet reshuffle and expansion as well as state-level political appointments. More than a year later, the Pilot camp is now demanding a change of guard rather than a cabinet rejig or political appointments. Congress sources said Gehlot may go for expansion in the cabinet before Diwali on November 4. If it is a reshuffle in the cabinet, it would be after Diwali, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-people-maibaap-to-decide-next-cm-forming-congress-govt-is-important/articleshow/87409091.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata municipal corporation ramps up Covid-19 tests in hot spots||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has ramped up Covid testing in areas that have witnessed a spurt in numbers in the past fortnight. After an initial feedback from borough executive health officers, the KMC health department has decided to bring as many people in the infected zones under RT-PCR tests as possible. The department has also launched an awareness drive in the infected zones to motivate citizens whose second vaccination doses are still pending. According to a KMC health department official, they had reasons to worry about several neighbourhoods in the Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt where Covid cases were going up rapidly. The KMC health department was also keeping a watch on areas located off EM Bypass due to their proximity to Rajpur and Sonarpur areas that have recently become Covid hotspots. Going by Covid data, areas such as Azadgarh, Bijoygarh, Dhakuria, Kasba, Baghajatin, Patuli, Garia, Nayabad, Mukundapur, Jadavpur and Santoshpur have witnessed a spurt after Durga Puja. More than 60% of the city's current Covid cases were being reported from these areas. However, KMC faces a challenge in keeping the infection at bay as those who tested positive from these areas were largely asymptomatic. Accordingly, the civic brass has decided to send mobile swab collection vans to these neighbourhoods, especially to market places, to bring more people under the test net. This apart, mobile swab collection vans will also be made available for residents of housing complexes and apartment buildings. A KMC health department official said the vans were told to do rounds at markets in areas like Azadgarh, Bijoygarh, Bansdroni, Garia, Golf Green, Patuli, Kasba, Garfa and Dhakuria, among other areas. “These are the markets that had become Covid hotspots during the peak of the second wave. Now these neighbourhoods adjacent to these markets are yet again showing an upward graph. We can’t take the matter lightly and need to take our guard,” said the civic official. Apart from ramping up Covid tests, the civic body also has also asked KMC medical officers who are running vaccination centres at the ward level to initiate a major campaign in the infected zones to bring recipients of second dose to the vaccination centres. “We are keeping extra doses for the recipients of second doses who stay in the infected zones and are still hesitant to get their doses in time,” said a civic official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-ramps-up-tests-in-south-kol-cov-hot-spots/articleshow/87407426.cms||Saikat Ray

Along with this, monitoring was also done at the level of returning officers and district election officers. The live webcasting was also monitored by the Election Commission (ECI),” said Gupta. “The polling was conducted peacefully and we haven’t received a single complaint with regard to law and order issue,” Gupta added. Mohni Bai (100) was one among the oldest who cast her vote at a polling booth in Bhinder (Udaipur). “Democracy gets strengthened by voting,” she said after casting her vote. In Vallabhnagar, out of 2,453 differently-abled voters, 2,215 (90.30%) exercised their franchise and in Dhariaward, out of 2,138 voters, 1,764 (82.50%) cast their votes.

According to a KMC official, the health department took the decision following a sharp drop in the number of first-dose recipients of Covaxin. At present the KMC runs 37 Covaxin vaccination centres across the city. “We have decided to keep the first-dose vaccination suspended at our Covaxin centres from Monday for an indefinite period,” a KMC health department official said. An acute shortage of Covaxin had forced the health department to shut Covaxin centres in July. The drive resumed after KMC received supply from the Centre. “This time we have no dearth of vaccine, but we need to focus on recipients of the second dose,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/civic-body-to-stop-1st-dose-covaxin-shots/articleshow/87407463.cms||Saikat Ray

All the gathered fans went delirious bursting firecrackers, waving banners that read ‘Stay Strong Prince Aryan’ and chants of “We love Shah Rukh”, even as security guards and a posse of policemen jostled to provide the actor’s car a safe passage back into the building. If the crowd lined up on pavements outside Arthur Road jail kept the police on their toes, with barricades and ropes to keep onlookers within limits and an eye on suspected pickpockets following reports of at least seven mobile phone thefts outside the jail on Friday, it was a busy day for some of SRK’s biggest fans too. Cops and guards struggled to control the large crowd in a lane leading to Mannat, SRK’s home, on SaturdayAs the wait for the star son’s arrival grew longer, a man kept the crowd intrigued with his “bhavishya vani” or fortune-telling for the Khan family while two others stopped by to regale fans with the quintessential SRK song ‘Tujhe dekha toh yeh jaana sanam’ on their shehnai and dafli. “Aaj bahut din baad khushi ka mahaul hai,” said Lateef Khan, a 20-year-old from Kurla and member of Team Shah Rukh Khan, a fan club with more than 2 million followers. Upset at not being able to welcome back “Prince Khan” on Friday, he refused to go home and camped with a friend instead in order to board the 6am train for Aryan’s grand arrival. It was the fifth time in the past two weeks that Omkar Chavan (24) and Ashwini Gupta (22) had travelled from Kalyan to Bandra in order to stand by their hero. “I’m so happy that Aryan is free. Yeh hai sachhai ki jeet,” said Chavan, promising to distribute sweets among the poor in celebration of Aryan’s homecoming, which hit a crescendo with a dhol tasha group signalling his arrival, even as father and son remained hidden behind the darkened windows of the Range Rover.  Arthur Road jail built in 1925 is one of the most crowded prisons in the state. Although its official capacity is 800, it currently houses around 2,800 inmates. However, Aryan’s co-accused Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, who were also granted bail on Thursday, were still in jail as formalities took time. Arbaaz’s father, Aslam Merchant, said they had completed the court formalities so his son, too, could walk free on Sunday. The NCB had arrested 20 accused in the cruise drugs bust case, of whom 14, including Aryan, Arbaaz and Munmun, have been granted bail. Justice Nitin Sambre in his release order for the trio had set out 14 stringent bail conditions, including immediate surrender of passport, a weekly three-hour attendance at the NCB office, no statements to media, the requirement to join in the investigation when called upon to do so and not to delay the trial once it starts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-if-weve-been-there-for-srk-in-good-times-we-need-to-be-with-him-now/articleshow/87409162.cms||Mohua Das

A 50-year-old mechanic succumbed to burn injuries as an auto-rickshaw caught fire during welding work at a workshop in Chhani. Fire officials said that Hussain Khan Pathan, who lives near Chhayapuri Railway station, was busy doing welding work when its spark caused a fire that engulfed the auto-rickshaw and Pathan. “The man was caught in the fire, but no bystanders cared to pull him out or call the fire brigade or ambulance. Instead, they were all taking photos and recording videos of the accident on their mobile phones,” said fire officer Harshwardhan Puwar of Chhani fire station. A fireman, who was passing by the spot, noticed the crowd and the burning vehicle and immediately informed the fire brigade and ambulance. A team of firemen reached the spot within minutes and pulled an unconscious Pathan out of the fire. The 108 ambulance staff examined Pathan and declared him dead. Fire was doused quickly and Pathan’s body was shifted to SSG Hospital for postmortem. “It is possible that there may be some gas leakage in the auto which may have caused the fire. The exact cause will be known after a proper investigation,” said a police official. A case of accidental death was registered at Chhani police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/mechanic-dies-as-autorickshaw-catches-fire-during-welding/articleshow/87409151.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to staffing companies, healthcare and IT have been leading job creators while the workforce in banking and finance is still 10-20% lower than the pre-Covid levels.“The Diwali demand has improved hiring in retail sector which has gone up to 80% of the pre-Covid level. But the hospitality sector is still operating with 60% of the workforce it employed before the Covid pandemic,” said Milap Singh of Shri Balaji Manpower Services. Besides healthcare and IT, sectors like manufacturing, FMCG and auto have hired back most of its people it was forced to reduce due to the demand contraction during the pandemic. Shipra Sharma Bhutani, CEO of Capacita Connect said, “While normalcy has returned to manufacturing and FMCG, the demand for delivery boys have shot up significantly.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Cheap Chinese lights still in demand||LUCKNOW: Chinese lights and other decorative items have stolen the show from Indian products this Diwali once again because of low prices and innovation. According to data obtained from several traders in the city, the business of lights in the festival season is of around Rs 20 crore, of which the share of China made-products—lights, lamps and other decorative items— is Rs 16-17 crore. “Whenever a customer visits our shop, we show them both Chinese and Indian products. Most people prefer Chinese products due to cost and innovation. I want to sell local products, but cannot stop selling products which are in demand,” said Mayank Bansal, a shopkeeper at Nakkhas. A metre of Chinese light of any colour costs Rs 70-Rs 100, while the price of the same locally manufactured product is Rs 120-Rs 150. Similarly, gift items like lamps, showpieces and idols imported from China cost less than local makes, he added. Angad Pathak, a shopkeeper in Yahiyaganj, said “Despite being imported from China and Taiwan, the price of their products is lower than that of Indian because of the low cost of production.” Prabal Gupta a shopkeeper at Charbagh said, “Though Chinese products are less durable and get dysfunctional after two and three usages, customers prefer them because of low cost, particularly at a time when purchasing power has declined due to high inflation.” Traders said that there are also several Chinese products of which there is no Indian alternative. “For example, the hot balloon air lamps which remain in high demand during Diwali and New Year have no local manufacturer. As a result, Chinese products have a monopoly,” said Tarun Bajpai, a wholesaler of gift items and lights in Rakabganj. Chinese products also have more options and variants compared to Indian products. Anshu Kumar, a shopkeeper in Dandaiya Market said, “We have more than 15 variants of Chinese lamps and lights. This year a golden lamp with an effigy of Lord Ganesh and Goddess Laxmi is in high demand.” Jai Tripathi, a resident of Balaganj, said, “We purchase new lights every year to decorate our house. I don’t even look if the product is Chinese or locally manufactured, I just get the one which has variety and is cheaper.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cheap-chinese-lights-still-in-demand/articleshow/87410664.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Hyderabad||Explain stand on govt land auction: HC to Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court (HC) on Friday gave four weeks’ time to the state government to explain its stand on a petition filed by actress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vijayashanti questioning the state’s policy to auction government land. Upon a request from the state to grant it some more time, a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy posted the case to December 3 asking the state to file its counter by that time. The former MP in her petition found fault with the state for deciding to sell away certain portions of government land on untenable reasons that they are difficult to be protected from encroachments. Her counsel in the last hearing questioned how a state could express helplessness in such matters. He also brought to the notice of the court the decision of the state to create a 1,000-acre land bank in each district for future auctions. “These two contentions do not go together,” he said. The Bharatiya Janata Party leader Vijayashanti said the Telangana Land Encroachment Act, 1905, is meant to protect the public properties. “If the state government feels that this old law is not sufficient to protect government land, then it has got ample legislative power to add new teeth to this law to make it more effective,” Vijayashanti said in her plea. Instead, the state government chose to monetise the land parcels by selling them away to private parties, she said. The bench adjourned the case to December 3.

Amruta Indurkar introduced the dignitaries, followed by felicitation and rendition of Vande Mataram. While delivering the introductory speech, Vishnu Changde, a member of NU Management Council and president of the organizing committee, said, “There is a misunderstanding and an attitude of disregard among the youth for leaders in politics.

---||Chandigarh||Wine makers ask Pb to check spurious liquor||Chandigarh: The International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), apex body of the premium alcoholic beverages sector, has requested the Punjab government for checks and enforcement to counter the trade of illicit and spurious liquor. The association recommended a "balanced, pragmatic and transparent approach" to deal with the AlcoBev business in the state for promoting responsible consumption and building economic opportunity. It said spurious liquor damaged health and stunted the government’s ability to tax and control legally produced alcohol. Market estimates suggest that in the year 2019-20, Punjab’s revenue loss due to illicit liquor trade was Rs 55 crore for country liquor and Rs 355 crore for Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL). After the hooch tragedies in Tarn Taran, Amritsar, and Gurdaspur, the state government launched ‘Operation Red Rose’ to nail excise-related crimes, track the smugglers, and do administrative coordination to check illicit distillation, smuggling, and fake branding of liquor but the measures were not sustained. ISWAI secretary general Suresh Menon said: "Bootleggers who sell counterfeit products in premium branded bottles not only pose a risk to the consumers but also damage brand reputation, restrict future investment by companies, and lead to a loss of legal sales."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/wine-makers-ask-pb-to-check-spurious-liquor/articleshow/87409156.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Kutch: Five arrested for assault on dalits, cops claim personal rivalry||RAJKOT: Five people were arrested for the brutal attack on six members of a Dalit family that has alleged that they were targeted by members of upper caste as they turned up for the installation ceremony at a temple. However, Kutch police said the allegations about temple entry were being probed in detail and claimed villagers did not discriminate against Dalit families. The incident had happened in Ner village of Bhachau taluka on October 26.“We have arrested five persons and one more has been detained for questioning. Two other accused who suffered injuries in the incident are in the hospital” said Mayur Patil, superintendent of police, Kutch (east). In all, 16 people have been named in the FIR lodged by victim Jaga Vaghela. Those arrested were Paba Rabari (35), Kana Koli (22), Naran alias Naya Ahir (36), Hema Rabari (40) and Kana Sadur Koli (32) while Dinesh Balasara has been detained for questioning while two accused Kana Ahir and Rana Balasara in hospital. Police have formed 12 teams to nab all the other accused. All have been booked for relevant sections of IPC including attempt to murder as well as sections of Atrocities Act. Addressing reporters on Saturday, Patil said, “According to primary investigation, the villagers had no objection with Dalit family praying at the temple, but looks like a fallout of political rivalry. The victim Jaga Vaghela had won the gram panchayat by-election in 2018 garnering 80% votes and all communities had voted for him. He had defeated Bhanji Suthar whom he has accused of the conspiracy of October 26 attack.” Suthar is still on the run. The quarrel had started after buffaloes were left open in Jaga’s farm and he has alleged that this was part of Suthar’s conspiracy. Patil added that Jaga did not own the land but it was pastoral land. Police claimed that victim's family had been allowed to pray inside the temple peacefully earlier too. Rs21L compensation for victims The state government on Friday announced Rs 21 lakh compensation for the six victims. Social justice and empowerment minister Pradipsinh Parmar said that chief minister Bhupendra Patel had immediately ordered strict action in the case and police have lodged an FIR against the accused. Meanwhile, Congress leader and Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mewani said it was only after he threatened an agitation over the issue that the government announced compensation. “Our fight against untouchability will, however, continue,” he tweeted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/five-arrested-for-assault-on-dalits-cops-claim-it-was-personal-rivalry/articleshow/87407537.cms||---

---||Jaipur||‘Despite available treatment, 50% breast cancer patients come in advanced stage’||Jaipur: Despite advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in the past few years, doctors are still worried as approximately 50% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in the advanced stages (III and IV stage) in our country.“For the diagnosis of breast cancer, we now have guided biopsy which is minimally invasive and tests which can detect hormone receptors (oestrogen and progesterone) and expression of the HER2 gene on the cancer cells from a sample of tissue. These tests help in deciding which targeted treatment, if any, should be used for tumours in addition to standard chemotherapy. Also, several new effective drugs are available. But, still far too many patients come in advanced stages,” said Dr Hemant Malhotra, director of Cancer Centre, at Mahatma Gandhi medical college.Genetic testing is also evolving that helps in identifying people at risk of breast cancer. “Since approximately 15 to 20% of breast cancer can be hereditary, genetic testing for familial cancer genes is advocated for some patients and their family members. Patients who have a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene (amongst other genes) should get screening for breast and ovarian cancers regularly, so as to diagnose these cancers early for timely treatment. These patients have the option for prophylactic surgical treatment (removal of breast and/ovaries) and this has become more common in the western world (the Angelina Jolie effect!) but is much less accepted in our conservative society. Patients with mutations in these genes may also benefit from a new class of drugs known as PARP Inhibitors,” said Dr Malhotra.Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the world. According to health experts, while the age adjusted incidence rates in India is lower than the western countries, the actual burden of breast cancer is high due to large population. “The implementation of improved surgical techniques, adjuvant therapy, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy has made a major impact on disease-free survival and overall survival in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer,” said Dr Sudhir Palsaniya, consultant medical oncology, at a private hospital. Not only doctors but also social activists are creating awareness about breast cancer. Such a camp was organised at Paharganj by Jaipur Cancer Relief Society and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind to educate women on breast cancer. Sanowar Asrar, one of the organisers of the camp, said, “Women should be aware as early diagnosis holds the key to effective treatment.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/despite-available-treatment-50-breast-cancer-patients-come-in-advanced-stage/articleshow/87409178.cms||---

Currently, one litre of petrol in the city costs Rs 112.64 and diesel costs Rs 105.84 per litre. With colleges reopening and offices resuming, people have started vehicle pooling to save the travel costs. “My friend and I have to travel to college every day from Yapral to Medchal. Earlier, we used to travel individually and pooled only once or twice in a month. But now, we try to pool together along with other college friends to ensure that our travel costs is saved,” said Anand Varma, a student. The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) is also witnessing a rise in number of people using its buses. Many additional buses have been added to routes leading to suburban areas such as Ghatkesar, Ibrahimpatnam, Keesara, Chevella and Medchal where many engineering colleges are located. “On long routes such as Koti-Patancheru, Dilsukhnagar-Secunderabad, Medchal-Secunderabad and Secunderabad-Patancheru, we are observing a pre-Covid occupancy level. Of the 800 routes, the occupancy in over 700 routes has returned to normalcy,” said V Venkateshwarlu, executive director, greater Hyderabad region, TSRTC. For shorter distances, some people are also depending on shared autos that operate from key junctions, especially in the IT corridor. “Earlier, a travel from KPHB to Hi-tec City would cost me Rs 60-100 in cabs. Now, I have started using shared autos which cost me Rs 20-40 for the same distance,” said Sai Teja, a resident of KPHB. People from some communities have reached out to the TSRTC to enhance end-to-end connectivity of buses. For example, a gated community in Gundlapochampally recently submitted a representation to the TSRTC seeking extension of the bus to its main gate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/rising-fuel-costs-lead-to-rtc-dependence/articleshow/87407552.cms||---

The state government has provided Rs 15 crore to the public works department of the Nashik unit to repair the potholes. “The work is being carried out on war footing with sections of roads with major damages being given top priority. Most of such works have been completed and we intend to finish all the work by November 15,” said Prashant Sonawane, the superintendent engineer of Nashik PWD. The officer said that he had directed all the officials to finish the work at the earliest without compromising on the quality. Roads in Niphad, Chandwad, Nandgaon, Dindori, Kalwan, Surgana talukas are worst affected. The roads in the rural areas are in bad shape due to the heavy rainfall during the monsoon season. Senior officials from the department said the work related to filling potholes with the help of ‘tar’ has picked up after the monsoon season. During the rainy season, it is difficult to carry out the work in tar. “In case of very heavy traffic, temporary measures such as filling the potholes with murrum (soil) or putting cement blocks are taken up to cut down the damage to the vehicles. We started the repair after the rainfall stopped in early October,” the officer added. A total length of 3,500 km roads managed by the PWD were damaged due to the rain. The shortage of funds was another constraint that the department was facing. “Due to Covid, there were constraints of funds as well and hence, the contractors, who were already given contracts for construction and maintenance of roads for next five years, were unable to carry out their work. With the state government giving funds, the works is now being expedited,” said the officer. The PWD requires Rs 35 crore for the repairs. The state government has given Rs 15 crore so far and the remaining funds will follow after the current work is completed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/state-govt-gives-rs-15-crore-to-repair-roads-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/87404670.cms||Abhilash Botekar

According to sources, the chargesheet that may run into hundreds of pages is currently lying in the form of soft copy with the district attorney of the prosecution department of Kaithal police. Besides filing the chargesheet, the police have also decided to press the case for the fast track trial of cases so that the issue could reach a conclusive end. The incident dates back to August 8 when Kaithal police had arrested three persons, who had procured the answer keys of the written test conducted by Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) on August 7 and 8. This led to more arrests and it had come to light that the answer key was leaked from a printing press of Jammu and was further old for Rs 1 crore to rest of the accused and beneficiaries. While continuing with the investigations, police arrested the owners of coaching centres, middlemen, beneficiaries and other accused. Prominent among the accused whose arrest led to the unveiling of entire scam include Ramesh, an owner of Coaching centre and two residents of Kashmir Nazir and Aizaz. Following their interrogation and other links police had been able to reach Jitender Kumar, a techie of the printing press of Kashmir and Rakesh, the manager of printing press. It is learnt that initially the deal was finalized between printing press men and local conduit for Rs 60 lakh but later it was found to be of Rs one crore. Payments were to be made in cash after recovering from the beneficiaries. Investigations revealed that Rakesh had copied the data in a pen drive from the press on July 31 and had shared the same with Jitender. The data was of question papers and answerkeys. Jitender got the hard copies of question paper and answekey and had to handover to Muzzafar. Muzzafar had passedit one to Aizaz and they had sold to Afzal for Rs 60 lakh. Afzal and Muzzafar further had dealing with links in Haryana through Raj Kumar for Rupees one crore and the payment was to be made after examination. While Raj Kumar had to further give to Ved Parkash, a resident of Rohtak. Ved Parkash further circulated the same through Ramesh and other accused. Notably, incident took place earlier this month when HSSC had announced to cancel the recruitment process of Haryana police constable following the paper and answer key leak during the first session on August 8. “As on now the chargesheet is lying for vet. Let prosecution clear and submit it in court, following this we shall elaborate upon the more detail,’’ said Lokendera Singh, Kaithal SP. “While, further investigations are in progress as we are to arrest more beneficiaries and those involved in the scam,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/crime-branch-to-submit-chargesheet-against-45-accused-by-monday/articleshow/87409255.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Goa||Goa: Congress govt will give deserving families Rs 72,000/year, says Rahul Gandhi||PANAJI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday that if his party is elected to office in Goa, a ‘concept of justice’ scheme will be implemented, under which deserving families would get Rs 72,000 in their accounts annually. Addressing a large gathering of party workers at Bambolim-Taleigao, Gandhi promised to make Goa a progressive state with a focus on the employment, tourism, healthcare and education sectors. He also said that Congress would not allow Goa to be converted into a coal hub. He also reiterated the party’s stand not to allow linear projects in the state. Touching upon a range of topics from unemployment to the three linear projects, Gandhi said that the focus of the Congress government will be on employment generation but without damaging the state’s environment. The justice scheme, Gandhi said, was floated by his party during the last parliamentary polls to facilitate the transfer of Rs 72,000 annually into the accounts of poor families. This was Gandhi’s first visit to Goa ahead of the assembly polls even as Congress continues to fight a two-fold battle — stopping its workers and functionaries from deserting the party, and attempting to form the government after sitting in the opposition for two consecutive terms. Congress has already lost several party workers and its former CM, Luizinho Faleiro, to TMC. He also said that he has discussed with party functionaries about Goa’s unemployment problem, which he said has reached a historic level under the present government. “The government has failed to provide jobs. Jobs can be created through sustainable development. Our focus will be on employment-generation through healthcare tourism and by setting up an education hub, but without harming the ecology of the state. We will take Goa on the path of progress,” he said. There has been a systematic plan in operation to attack small- and mid-level businesses and farmers, he alleged Gandhi also said that his party would not allow “beautiful Goa” to be turned into a coal hub. “I have also told this to the fishermen I met earlier, that come what may, we will not allow a coal hub in Goa. The three linear projects that have been started, too, we will not allow to happen,” he said. He said that during the day, he met families that have been affected by the stoppage of mining, and assured them that Congress would try to restart mining legally. On a wider perspective, Gandhi said that for Congress, Goa’s polls are not just a political battle, but an ideological battle, and the rest of the world will see how it protects its culture and environment and transmits its most powerful ideas to the people of India. “We are not just fighting an election here. We are fighting about defining what Goa will become. How it will treat itself and the rest of the world. I want Goa to show the rest of India that Goa can stand together and maintain its wonderful culture and environment, and still move forward with vigour and dynamism,” he said. He said that his party represents one ideology and the BJP another. “We are the political party that represents a united and prosperous Goa. We do not spread hatred. There is a party that has an idea that Goa has to be divided, (that) people have to disrespect each other. This is a fight of ideologies,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-govt-will-give-deserving-families-rs-72k/year-says-rahul/articleshow/87409342.cms||Bindiya Chari

The statement came from Owaisi at the end of his two-day visit of Aurangabad, where he held a series of marathon meetings with office-bearers from across the state. Owaisi said, “I reiterate that the alliance with VBA was never called off from our end. We respect Prakash Ambedkar and will continue to do so. We never wanted to break alliance with him” In response to another question, he said, “Politics is the art of impossible. If situation arises, we may consider the alliance.” He questioned the secular credential of Congress and NCP in the state and said, “These two parties warned the Muslims that if they don’t vote for them, Sena and BJP will come to power. Post elections, Congress, NCP and Sena came together. This is hypocrisy.” He blamed the two parties for only being interested in bagging the Muslim votes and not in empowerment and upliftment of the community. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said that to remind the Congress-NCP of their promise to grant 5% reservation to Muslims in the state, party workers from across the state while putting tricolor on their vehicles will be heading to Mumbai on November 27. AIMIM intends to hold a mega gathering, which will be addressed by both the Owaisi brothers. Imtiaz also raised the issue of encroachment and usurping of Waqf properties, which are spread over 93,000 acres in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/we-did-not-call-off-pact-with-vba-aimim-chief/articleshow/87404740.cms||Mohammed Akhef

In 2020-21, e-commerce platform Flipkart sold more than 2 crore ‘one district-one product’ products worth around Rs 1,000 crore, benefitting lakhs of small artisans and craftspersons in the state. MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the government had tied up with e-commerce websites to provide a wider platform for ODOP products, including an international market under which products, like Kala Namak rice, were being sold internationally. “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of vocal for local, e-commerce websites have proved to be highly beneficial, especially during the pandemic where more people had shifted to online marketplaces. Lakhs of workers under the ODOP scheme, a flagship programme of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, launched in 2018, have benefitted vastly from this,” Singh said. The government had signed an MoU with Flipkart in 2020 to sell ODOP products on the website, having earlier tied up with e-commerce website Amazon. More than 20,000 products under ODOP are sold across the platforms. The ODOP scheme was launched in 2018 with the aim of identifying one special product from each district so that it could be promoted, packaged and marketed better to boost the industry and help artisans. Currently, there are some districts where more than one product is being promoted by the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/e-commerce-site-sold-2cr-odop-products-in-2020-21/articleshow/87410784.cms||---

The incident took place in the early hours of Thursday near a petrol pump at Wakad, when the victim, an employee of a telecom company, was returning home after refueling his motorcycle. Police sub-inspector (PSI) Rohit Divate of the Wakad police said when the complainant, a resident of Lohegaon, came out of the petrol pump, two men on a motorcycle blocked his way. “They claimed to be cops and alleged that the complainant had kicked their motorcycle while refueling. They removed the key of his motorcycle and told him to furnish his driving license,” Divate said. The complainant became suspicious and took out his smartphone to call a friend. “However, the suspects told him that they would allow him to make a call only after reaching the police station. One of them then took charge of his motorcycle and they started driving towards Dange Chowk,” said Divate. After some distance, the suspects stopped and told the complainant to give them Rs 3,000. “The complainant said he did not carry that much cash, nor did he have it in his account,” Divate said. But the suspects then simply told the complainant to find his way to Wakad police station, and drove off with his motorcycle and smartphone, collectively worth Rs 55,000. “When the complainant reached the police station, he found that he had been cheated,” said Divate.

This is to express urgency and show the need for public action to stop this funding. The climate organisation threatened to put thousands of protesters outside some of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions to force them to support a just energy transition and most vulnerable countries to tackle climate breakdown. The protests will be creative, with street murals and projections, besides climate memorials for those who lost their lives to the climate crisis. Youth organisers around Asia will lead these actions, both digital and offline, in seven countries that include India and Bangladesh. The African actions will target presidents, COP26 delegates, and Africa Development Bank (AfDB). In Europe’s and world’s biggest financial centres that include London, Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, and Amsterdam, the targets will be the Bank of England, ABP, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays, National Bank of Belgium, and the French banks. There will be in-person and virtual gatherings across the US for more than 20 actions to demand the Federal Reserve and Citi Bank to end fossil finance and account for climate risk. More actions will be in the Pacific region and Latin America. "The era of fossil fuels is over. People are rallying against fossil finance and those who run it, to seize an opportunity to speed up climate action and build both equitable societies and resilient economies. It is past time for the rich countries and financial institutions to fund the energy transition," said Farzana Faruk, Bangladesh climate justice activist and member of volunteer organisation Most Affected People and Areas (MAPA). For 350.org, its Asia finance campaigner Chuck Baclagon said: "We call on world leaders meeting at COP26 to align with the interests of the world’s majority that seeks policies to reduce global warming and carbon emissions and act on zero-carbon pledges. For this, the economic stimulus should be rerouted to renewable energy solutions, those owned and controlled locally."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/green-team-to-target-banks-in-26-countries/articleshow/87409329.cms||Neel Kamal

The court held the seized contraband would have been certainly circulated amongst the venerable section of society but for its timely capture by the officers. “Considering the nature of the offence and the threats it causes to the health and social security of the public, particularly the youth, and its adverse effect on the economic, cultural and social foundation of the society, it does not appear to this court that the accused deserves a much lenient and liberal consideration,” Special Judge AA Joglekar said. The woman was also fined Rs 2 lakh. It was the prosecution's case that the NCB was acting on secret information it had received on November 23, 2015. It said the following morning, the woman was identified and stopped as she crossed the customs clearance with her baggage. After a search was conducted, nothing incriminating was found in it. The NCB then requested her to accompany them for a thorough medical examination at a government hospital. Subsequently, after obtaining permission from the magistrate’s court, the woman was taken to J J Hospital. The prosecution said during her medical examination, a woman doctor informed the officers that two oval-shaped pellets were recovered from the woman’s rectum. Suspecting more pellets, she was admitted to the hospital for their “release or surgical removal”. The prosecution further submitted that between November 24 and 29, 2015, the woman “released” a total of 78 pellets through her rectum “randomly and intermittently” which were cleaned and kept under the custody of the on duty staff nurse under lock and key. On December 2 it was handed over to the NCB. It was alleged that the pellets were cut open and a white-coloured solid lump-like substance was recovered from each. A drug detection kit detected the substances to be cocaine, the prosecution submitted. While the NDPS Act qualifies 2 gram of cocaine as small quantity, commercial quantity is quantified at 100 gram or more. The woman in her defence had claimed the 78 pellets were concealed in her body by her friend after she was intoxicated by him and she did not know about their presence. The court, though, said, “On going through the entire evidence adduced by the witnesses, it does not create any manner of doubt on the fact that the accused has the real knowledge of the nature of the substance kept in her possession. The rival defence put forth by the accused does not inspire any confidence.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-no-leniency-hiv-zimbabwe-woman-gets-10-year-jail-for-smuggling-drugs/articleshow/87409407.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In response to a PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal seeking prohibition on use of coal as fuel for industries and demanding that all industrial units functioning on coal be shifted to gas, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati has asked the state government, “Why the Gazette Notification dated 26.10.2017 or any similar notification/order by which it declares coal to be an approved fuel under Section 2(d) of the Air Pollution Act be not struck down?” the court has sought reply by December 17. The high court agreed to the petitioner’s insistence that prohibiting coal as a fuel and shifting to natural gas will help in reduction of pollution levels. The high court cited various court orders and its effects on shifting industries to the use of PNG in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. All 1,635 industrial units in Delhi have completely shifted to the use of PNG. In NCR in Haryana, out of 1,469 identified industrial units, 408 units have shifted. In Uttar Pradesh, out of 2,273 units, as many as 1,167 units have shifted to gas. In Rajasthan, out of 436 identified units, 124 units have shifted to PNG. After citing these figures, the HC insisted that Gujarat too can try to achieve this. In response, government pleader Manisha Lavkumar Shah submitted that it is very difficult for the state government to take sudden policy decision to do away with coal. This may lead to lot of chaos and many small scale industries may be put into various difficulties. But the government pleader also maintained that usage of coal leads to air pollution and sooner or later, the government will have to take an appropriate policy decision to completely switch over to natural gas like CNG and PNG. Citing the Supreme Court orders, the HC said that the old concept that ‘development and ecology cannot go together’ is no longer acceptable. Sustainable development is the answer. The development of industries is essential for the economy of the country, but at the same time, the environment and the eco-systems have to be protected. The pollution created as a consequence of development must be commensurated with the carrying capacity of our eco-systems. After recording the high level of pollution and the health risk the people are at, the high court also said that the state government has powers to end the practice of use of coal as fuel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-asks-why-govt-nod-to-coal-as-fuel-should-not-be-junked/articleshow/87407717.cms||---

Since 2007, the missing persons’ cell has helped the CID in various drives to solve 151 cases.  The data released by the CID crime states that in 2020 and 2021, 82 missing persons were found in special initiatives while from 2007 to 2019, 69 people were found. Anil Pratham, ADGP CID crime who handles the children and women cell, said that the majority of the people were traced to their homes. Pratham said no human-trafficking gang was operational in Gujarat. Those involved in such crimes were outsiders, he said. “We have found evidence of such people coming to Gujarat from West Bengal, Bangladesh, and parts of north India,” he said. Pratham said that since 2007, drives have been taken up regularly to find missing children. Special teams are formed for missions. He said that in the city, 25 teams were created and 18 police stations were identified in whose jurisdictions the number of missing children was high. Most of these police stations were in the city’s east. According to officials, 1.35 lakh people in all had been missing in the state. Of them, 18,000 are yet to be found. In Ahmedabad city, 50,000 had been missing and 2,371 are yet to be traced. Pratham said the success rate of tracing missing people in state is 95.7%; the figure is 96% in Ahmedabad city. In other cities, success rate in tracing missing kids is 86.89%. Pratham said that in the majority of the cases, the missing persons return but their relatives or their parents fail to inform police. Hence records show them as missing. Also, when some women elope and find their new life happy, they do not get in touch with their parents. Even if they do, the parents in many cases do not update police about the circumstances.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cops-launch-drive-trace-51-missing-persons-in-five-days/articleshow/87407703.cms||---
---||Hubballi||RSS opposed to secretive religious conversion||Dharwad: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on Saturday said religious conversion should stop and those who change their faith should announce it.The Sangh also said that it will welcome if any anti-conversion bill is passed.“Conversion should be stopped and people who are converted have to announce that they have converted. There are people who get converted and do not disclose that they have converted. They take double benefits,” RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale said at a press conference here. He was talking to reporters at the conclusion of the three-day Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM) meeting of the Sangh here.He said the RSS per se was not opposed to voluntary conversion from one religion to another but the forced conversion by minority communities just to increase their numbers is not acceptable. The opposition by the minority communities to the anti-conversion law reveals their intention. Already 10 states have passed the law and so has the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh. In Karnataka, let the law be passed. If there are shortcomings, amendments can be made. It is not correct to oppose the law even before it is passed, Hosabale said.Replying to a question on Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting Pope, the RSS functionary said there was nothing wrong in the Prime Minister of a country meeting the dignitaries or heads of other countries as that would enhance India’s prestige.To a query on population policy, Hosabale said every nation should have a population policy which should be applicable to all. He also said the Sangh had passed a resolution to this effect a few years ago. To another question, Hosabale said the BJP-led central government has already stated that it will bring Uniform Civil Code and hoped that it will keep up its words.When asked about proposal to ban bursting of firecrackers during Deepavali, he said environment protection is a major concern and it should be an ongoing activity. “Why does this question arise only during Deepavali? If it is to be banned there should be a comprehensive plan. Banning crackers just ahead of the festival will lead to a major loss to manufacturers and traders and hit those working in cracker factories,” he said.Hosabale, reacting to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s remark that moral policing is a reaction to an action, said nobody should take law into their hands. “However, when someone’s feelings are hurt there is bound to be a reaction. But that does not justify taking law into their hands” he asserted.Shakhas to resume functioningRSS shakhas across the country which were not fully operational during the Covid-19 will now resume activities in full swing following Covid protocol. The RSS has also planned to expand its activities to the areas that did not have its shakhas.In Nagaland and Mizoram the percentage of Hindu population is very small and hence the number of shakhas is small there. In Meghalaya RSS is engaged in social service while in Ladakh there is a shakha. Lakshadweep has a unit which meets once in a week, he said.Hosabale said several people who participated in the country’s freedom movement and sacrificed their lives do not find a place in the pages of history. RSS will take up programmes to commemorate the sacrifice of unsung heroes and tell about them to the present generation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/rss-opposed-to-secretive-religious-conversion/articleshow/87406275.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Aurangabad||High voter turnout at Deglur bypoll||AURANGABAD: The byelection for the Deglur assembly seat in Nanded district on Saturday got a good response from the voters with approximate 63% voting reported till 7pm. The voter turnout, which was better than the 60.9% turnout during the 2019 assembly election, has prompted both Congress and BJP to claim victory. While the prestigious electoral battle saw Jitesh Antapurkar of Congress and Subhash Sabne of BJP locking horns, all eyes will be on the vote share of Uttam Ingole of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). Returning officer for Deglur assembly seat Sachin Giri said the polling went off smoothly without any untoward incident. “The extensive campaign by political parties could have led to relatively better turnout of voters. All Covid prevention norms prescribed by the Election Commission of India were followed in letter and spirit at all polling booths,” he said, adding that the final polling percentage would be declared later in the night. A total 12 candidates were in the fray for the byelection to the Deglur assembly seat, which has 2.9 lakh registered voters. Jitesh, the son of deceased Congress MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar, said he would emerge victorious. “The Congress, under the leadership of our Ashok Chavan, had made meticulous planning for the crucial election. The death of my father due to Covid had left the voters in Deglur-Biloli area shell-shocked. They came out in large numbers to cast their votes to express solidarity with me,” he said. Sabne, who had ditched Shiv Sena and joined BJP ahead of the election, could not be reached for his comments. BJP leader Shirish Boralkar said his party would repeat the result of the Pandharpur bypoll at Deglur too. “The heavy voter turnout is a sign of anger against the MVA government. Sabne had registered a win from Deglur in 2014 election and will taste victory again,” he said. The counting of the votes for the Deglur assembly byelection is scheduled on November 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/high-voter-turnout-at-deglur-bypoll/articleshow/87404840.cms||Prasad Joshi

The Pune Municipal Corporation has swung into action and said the pipeline would be repaired in a day or two. The breach damaged a 30-metre section of the road and affected vehicular traffic on the Dandekar bridge to Rajaram bridge lane. Traffic was diverted from Friday night to enable repair work. PMC officials expect the road to be open to vehicles by Sunday afternoon. “We have started refilling the part of the road damaged by the breach. The road will be tarred by tomorrow afternoon,” an official said. The damage to the pipeline disrupted water supply to Cantonment water works. PMC on Saturday increased water supply from other pipelines and started lifting water from the Mutha canal to meet the shortfall. “There will not be any water shortage, as we have increased supply to Cantonment water works from another pipeline. To meet the remaining requirement of 25-30 MLD, we requested the irrigation department to release water from the canal. The mechanism to lift water is already in place. Cantonment water works has started getting water from the canal from Saturday evening, which will be supplied to the water distribution network after treatment,” Aniruddha Pavaskar, head of PMC’s water supply department, said. The areas that received less water on Saturday included parts of Mohammadwadi, Laxminagar, parts of Hadapsar — areas that receive water from Cantonment water works. The city’s eastern parts did not face any disruptions as most get water from the Bhama Askhed project. Pavaskar said the 1,600mm raw water pipeline that was damaged was about 20 years old. “The breach developed at a joint. We are getting replacement material, joint and other parts from Hyderabad. Repairs have started. We expect the work to be completed in two to three days,” he said. Residents caught unawares Residents of the Panmala area said they heard a huge sound around 11.30pm on Friday. “Water started gushed out of a hole on the road caused by the breach. The current was so strong that water gushed into the homes. People fled outside in panic,” Sanjay Gaikwad, a resident, said. Arvind Kadam, another resident said, “We rescued elderly people from their homes. In some homes, water was two feet high.” “Water was gushing out like a fountain. We could see the road was damaged deep,” Rajesh Patake said. Manik More, an autorickshaw driver, said that water caused significant damage. “We were about to sleep when water started flowing inside. We managed to shift important material to a safer place,” More said. Vehicular traffic disrupted Movement of traffic was badly affected on Sinhagad Road, Satara Road, Mhatre Bridge, Karve Road, Lal Bahadur Shastri Road and Kilare Road. Motorists heading towards old parts of the city and Deccan Gymkhana were stuck in heavy snarls. “Generally, it takes me 30 minutes to reach Deccan from Dhayari, but on Saturday, it took two hours. Very few traffic policemen were present on the road to steer the traffic,” said Shirish Mangalvede. “In order to facilitate repair works, the vehicular movement was stopped on Sinhagad Road was stopped,” He said this had a cascading effect on the other roads. “We have deployed extra manpower at these spots and turned off traffic signals to allow us to manually clear traffic,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-fixing-road-hit-by-pipeline-breach-normalcy-by-today/articleshow/87406296.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Yellow alert issued for Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara districts & parts of Marathwada||KOLHAPUR/AURANGABAD: Showers, accompanied by lightning and thunder, are expected in Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli districts between November 1 and 3, said the reports from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Mumbai. Parts of Marathwada, including Nanded, Latur and Osmanabad districts, too are likely to receive some rainfall activity around November 3. The IMD has issued a yellow alert for the three Marathwada districts with chances of showers with thunderstorms along with lightning and gusty winds at isolated places. The IMD has also issued a yellow alert for Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli along with Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts from November 1. According to the weather officials, 25-45 mm rainfall will take place in the Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli districts every day during the period. The maximum temperature will remain constant at 32 degrees celsius and the minimum temperature will drop to 21 degrees celsius. So far, the region has had 80 days of rain during the four months of monsoon. The untimely showers had started a month ago. The IMD predicts the untimely rain will be scattered in the region. This is due to a combination of local pressure conditions and the effect of winds pushing from the eastern coast. Shriniwas Aundhkar, the director of APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, on Saturday said the depression being formed over the Bay of Bengal was expected to cause rainfall in parts of Marathwada. Meanwhile, Aurangabad and other parts of the region have been witnessing a gradual drop in the mercury level. Aurangabad on Saturday witnessed a minimum temperature of 14.9 degrees celsius, which was below normal by one unit. At 29.3 degrees celsius, the maximum temperature in the city was also below the normal by two units. Among other major Marathwada cities, Parbhani and Nanded reported minimum temperatures of 17 degrees celsius and 19.2 degrees celsius, respectively. The agriculture department has issued an advisory. The cultivation of sugar cane and other rabi crops has been completed and the crops are in the mid-stage of harvesting. The kharif crops are in the harvesting stage. The advisory states that crops, mainly the grain, should be trashed and stored in safe places before the arrival of the rain. Rabi crops in the mid-stage of growth need to be taken care of. Mangoes and cashews need to be protected from the gusty winds as per the advisory. Farmers have been told not to let water collect in their fields. They should make channels to drain out the excess water. Cattle may catch liver fluke disease due to microbial infection at this time. Farmers are advised to approach veterinary doctors in case of their animals get fever, which is a common symptom.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/yellow-alert-issued-for-kolhapur-sangli-satara-districts-parts-of-marathwada/articleshow/87404854.cms||---
---||Goa||Coffers empty, Margao civic body fights paucity of ideas to shore up revenue||MARGAO: Its coffers almost empty, the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) has been struggling to pay the salaries of its employees for the last 2-3 months. Though the civic body has put in place certain measures to shore up its revenue, the financial situation of the Class A municipality of the state’s commercial capital reflects the failure of successive councils controlled by local legislators in tapping available resources and creating new avenues for making the municipality financially self-reliant. MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes has introduced weekend drives by the taxation section in a bid to recover outstanding dues of house and trade tax from defaulters. During the drive, a team of civic officials visit commercial premises and issue demand notices with a request to pay up their dues. Though the exercise has begun to shown results with revenue trickling in, sources said that it may take some time before the financial situation turns steady. “This is perhaps for the first time in the history of the Margao municipality that civic officials are seen out on the field seriously trying to recover its dues,” former MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho said. “Though the efforts are driven not so much in the interest of the municipality as for their own concerns about receiving salary in time, it is hoped that the MMC will take a lesson in prudent financial management from the current financial crisis it faces.” While mounting revenue outstanding figures is not a new phenomenon in the MMC – revenue recovery ranks high among the agenda of every chief officer who takes charge of the office – what has added to the municipality’s financial burden is the door to door waste collection exercise which forms a major component of MMC’s outgo. While the MMC spends Rs 1.5 crore towards payment of staff salaries, over Rs 30 lakh goes towards payment of wages of the employees engaged by the waste collection contractor. Sources said that the door to door waste collection goes largely unsupervised by the municipality despite the MMC having had to file a police complaint against the same contractor two years ago for attempting to siphon public funds using “ghost workers.” Sources in the municipality said that over 60% of the commercial premises in the town ply their trade without possessing a valid trade licence, thus depriving the MMC of a substantial amount of trade tax it would have otherwise derived. The two municipal markets, too, - Gandhi market and new municipal market – hardly contribute to the municipality’s coffers, as most of the units are illegal. The report of a geographic information system (GIS) survey done of all commercial establishments in ward 14 of the town showed that the civic body was losing a whopping Rs 3.5 crore in revenue from a single ward because the establishments had managed to evade tax. Though the survey was done on a pilot basis, neither was the exercise extended to other parts of Margao, nor was any action taken to bring the unassessed units, as revealed in the GIS survey report, under the tax net. Moreover, the council has failed to work out any sustainable revenue development model for the town, despite the civic body having received significant amount of funds through bring in any new development projects in the town that could make the civic body financially self-reliant. Apathy of successive councils — from 2001 to 2016 — in properly utilising development grants has led to the accumulation of unused funds to the tune of Rs 8 crore. As was disclosed in the last council meeting, the government has told the MMC to refund the unutilised amount from the grants while allowing it to send a proposal for utilising a part of the unutilised central government grants for development works. Coutinho tellingly puts his finger on the situation. “The indifference of the civic officers to the sorry financial situation can be seen from the fact that they are now demanding a bonus when people are reeling under financial stress induced by the pandemic. Also, political interference in the municipality’s affairs should stop. Pleasing one’s political bosses and taking stern steps to widen the municipality’s tax net cannot go together.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/coffers-empty-margao-civic-body-fights-paucity-of-ideas-to-shore-up-revenue/articleshow/87409371.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Goa||In South Goa, officers shunted, strict curbs in place to stop land scams||PANAJI: After a series of reports by TOI on the land scams in the state, the South Goa district administration swung into action and has taken a raft of measures including shunting of several employees of revenue department dealing with land mutation cases. Speaking to TOI, collector Ruchika Katyal confirmed the transfers, but said that the exercise was done with the larger objective of enhancing efficiency of the district administration. Katyal said that she has also introduced measures to ensure a robust system of checks and balances is in place in land-related matters. TOI had recently highlighted a case wherein a Curtorim resident had been fraudulently dispossessed of 1,20,000 sq m of his land. Taking cognizance of several instances of such fraudulent cases of transfer of land using forged conveyance deeds, the South Goa district administration has already written to the vigilance department to conduct an inquiry into the matter. The administration also wrote to various government departments dealing in land-related cases asking them not to process cases concerning 11 properties bearing certain specific survey numbers in Salcete taluka. Acting on a complaint lodged by the Salcete mamlatdar, Fatorda police have already booked a case with regards to the fraudulent manner in which several properties were sought to be grabbed from the original landowners without their knowledge. Besides, deputy collector (revenue), Snehal Prabhu, has written to the town and country planner (TCP), Margao, state registrar, and sub-divisional officer, Salcete, drawing their attention to such cases so that any further progress in the fraudulently-done process is preempted. In a similar letter to the state registrar, Prabhu has asked that no sale deed, gift deed or any other conveyance deed or mode of any transfer pertaining to those survey numbers be processed or registered. The conversion cell of Salcete mamlatdar and the Salcete sub-divisional officer have also been directed against proceeding with partition/conversion cases pertaining to those properties.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/in-s-goa-officers-shunted-strict-curbs-in-place-to-stop-land-scams/articleshow/87409413.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sigh of relief as Tikri border opens after 11 months||NEW DELHI: Sweet seller Vishal was visibly relieved on Saturday. As he watched the barriers that have blocked the road at the Tikri border for 11 months being removed, the 21-year-old said, “Now there is a glimmer of hope that my business will pick up pace.” The opening of the passage at the spot, where farmers had located their agitation against three central farm laws for 11 months, will allow employees of factories near the Tikri border and in Bahadurgarh to avoid detours. They will also allow emergency vehicles like ambulance, firebrigade vehicle to pass. However, no three-wheeler or heavy traffic will be allowed at the moment. The partial opening of the road was the result of meetings among the farmers and police after some tension on Friday evening, when police tried to remove the barriers themselves.  The process was set off by the Supreme Court ordering on October 21 the opening of all traffic routes at the borders in Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur. When TOI reached the border on Saturday, a group of policemen could be seen waving to commuters and urging them to use the freshly opened road. A few of the agitating farmers too were also informing motorists about the same while others stood recording the scene on their phones. Kulwant Singh, who claimed to be a member of the farmers’ panel that met the government officials, said, “The carriageway was opened after three meetings with police. We never blocked the road; the cops put up the barricades and cement blocks.” Buta Singh Burjgill, president,BKU Ekta Dakaunda, disclosed to TOI, “It was decided that a 5-foot passage will be freed for two-wheelers, pedestrians and ambulances at Tikri border in view of the problems being faced by factory workers and two-wheelers.” At 1.49pm, an ambulance drove up to the barricades. After a short discussion, the protesters moved the barricades and allowed the emergency vehicle to pass through. While farmer Purushottam Singh Gill said the road would open between 7am and 8pm, DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh said no such timing had been fixed. Sukhwinder Singh was among the farmers guiding people in this manner. “These factory workers have been supporting us and they are poor, so we agreed to open the road to aid them,” Sukhwinder said. When asked why bigger vehicles weren’t being allowed, the farmers cited the risk to the agitators, pointing out how three women protestors were killed by truck in Bahadurgarh on Thursday. Samyukt Kisan Morcha made it plain that a collective decision would be taken at an appropriate time on whether the farmers’ agitation would continue at the same site or moved to Delhi. SKM warned that if the government wanted to open the road fully, it would have to meet the farmers' demands. A few farmers weren’t convinced by the need to remove the road barricades. Mithu Kumar of Jalandhar said, “From Friday night, police have been using JCBs to remove the barricades. In the next few days, we will learn whether the opening of barricades was the right decision.” At the market near the protest site, Chotelal, who has a clothes business, exulted, “Now I can expect some people to make purchases at my shop. My business is down to 10% of my normal because the border was closed.” Anil, who owns a crockery and utensils store, too was cautiously optimistic. “I can't say for certain, but, yes, there is a chance that business will improve,” he said. Vishal, a sweet seller, muttered, “I can't even calculate my losses. I hope people will now come and buy sweets.” Meanwhile, DCP (Outer north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav said no barricades had been removed at Singhu border. “Motorists have been provided alternative routes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sigh-of-relief-as-tikri-border-opens-after-11-mths/articleshow/87411566.cms||Abhay Singh

Addressing a programme, ‘Dharohar: Kushal haathon ki safal udaan’, in which at least 4,200 women weavers and artisans joined the BJP, she said: “Women in the state have not forgotten the time when they had no toilets in their homes and they had to go out in the open everyday to relieve themselves.” Claiming that women are safer under the Yogi Adityanath government, she said: “Earlier, women were afraid of going to police stations but today every police stations have a women’s help desk and an anti-Romeo squad is working to prevent crime against women,” she said. Irani distributed toolkits to 51,000 women on the occasion. She also launched ‘Hello Kamal Shakti’ mobile app. Women can call on the number (9534350350) to directly talk to the organization through WhatsApp and call. “Use the app to suggest ways to make the state and the country better,” she said.

Despite instructions from the President of India (POI), Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and Chief Minister’s office (CMO), the Dhantoli zone has yet not initiated action against illegal encroachment and construction on a residential plot in Chinchbhuvan. The POI had even directly ordered the zone to submit an action taken report. On September 17 this year, the state’s Lokayukt too took cognisance of the complaint and asked the zone office to submit compliance report. A resident of Chinchbuvan and senior citizen, Vishnu Khawale, had alleged that despite repeated complaints, the Dhantoli zone did not act against “construction of an illegal building next to his house, owned by one Satyabhama Bobade”. Bobade had allegedly encroached on Khawale’s place and extended the construction on a portion of road under Dhantoli zone. Khawale has been trying to free the encroached land and get the illegal constructions demolished since 2014. Following Khawale’s pursuit, the Dhantoli zone served a notice to Bobade and inspected the spot. The zone office had found illegal construction in the ground+2 building. Bobde had done almost 325.06 sqm illegal construction in almost every floor, as per the inspection report. Bobade’s application for stay of proceedings was also rejected by the NMC’s town planning department and state government’s urban development department. When the corporation still did not act, finally Khawale met the then civic chief Tukaram Mundhe who ordered action. However, due to Covid-induced lockdown, only some part of the construction was demolished and encroachment on the land owned by Khawale remained. Officials also ignored the action after the heads were changed. According to Khawale, the Dhantoli zone officials were giving vague answers. Later, Khawale met incumbent civic chief Radhakrishnan B. Instead of taking action against illegal construction, the zone on June 28 tried to demolish Khawale’s house. Khawale then lodged a complaint with the President of India (POI), PMO and CMO on July 8 this year. The zone’s assistant commissioner had given a written reply about action to be taken till September 30. However, no action has been taken so far. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B assured that action will be initiated against the wrongdoers and the illegal construction will be demolished.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nmc-yet-to-raze-illegal-construction-even-after-orders-from-prez-pmo-cmo/articleshow/87407747.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Sub-inspector Sandeep Gadilkar and his team arrested Ganesh, who was about to escape from Talegaon Dabhade. Gadilkar said the deceased, Raju Paradhe (53), was a daily wage worker, while his son, Ganesh, works as a housekeeping staff in a private company. “Raju used to abuse his wife, son and other family members, which used to leave Ganesh angry,” Gadilkar said. On Thursday morning, when Raju started abusing everyone in the house, the suspect became furious and hit his father with a rod. Ganesh then banged his father’s head against the compound wall, leading to his death, the sub-inspector said. He said the suspect has been arrested under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. In August this year, the Khed police had detained a 16-year-old boy for allegedly bludgeoning his alcoholic father to death. Police said the teen was subject to verbal and physical abuse by his father, which drove him to this act on August 10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/man-held-on-charge-of-killing-father/articleshow/87375984.cms||---
---||Pune||Jaggery trader arrested on murder plot charge||Pune: The Loni Kalbhor police on Friday night arrested the conspirator involved in the October 22 shootout in Urali Kanchan. A magisterial court on Saturday sent the conspirator, Ramesh Sonawane (35), in police custody remand till November 8. Two other persons were arrested earlier in the shootout case. “Sonawane, a jaggery trader from Rahu village in Daund, was taken into custody from Shirur following a tip-off. His involvement in the firing incident came to light after the two arrested assailants told police that they had shot dead the criminal on record, Santosh Jagtap, at his behest,” said senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi. Three assailants had opened fire on Jagtap in front of Hotel Sonai, an eatery, along the Pune-Solapur highway. Jagtap’s two private body guards had suffered bullet wounds. One of the guards opened fire on the assailants and killed one of them on the spot, the police said. “The assailants are friends of Sonawane. We are questioning the conspirator to find out if he had paid the assailants to kill Jagtap,” Mokashi added. The firing incident had occurred at Urali Kanchan Chowk around 2.30pm on October 22, when Jagtap was coming out of a restaurant with two of his aides. The other deceased, Swagat Khaire, reached the eatery with others in a sedan. They first opened fire at Jagtap moments after he had stepped out to have lunch. Khaire was among the men who came out of the car, while the driver stayed back. Shailesh Singh, one of Jagtap’s bodyguards, fired in retaliation. The Loni Kalbhor police had registered two first information reports— one against Khaire and four others, and the other against Jagtap’s personal bodyguard, Shailendra Singh, on the charge of gunning down Khaire.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/jaggery-trader-arrested-on-murder-plot-charge/articleshow/87406318.cms||---

Burning plastic causes pollution, so we give any plastic waste lying around to vendors,” he said. Efforts are on to turn the cemetery into a friendly and welcoming place. “People shouldn’t fear cemeteries as being ghostly and dreadful. They must look elegant and happy like a garden or a park,” he says. Besides disallowing plastic, the St Alex church in Calangute has asked its faithful to tone down grave decorations. “One garland of flowers is enough. We have told people there’s no need to decorate the graves extravagantly. The money spent on decoration can be diverted towards charity instead. What is important is prayer,” said parish priest Fr Polly Lobo. In line with Pope Francis’ call for Catholics to change their lifestyle and save the planet, the Archdiocese in 2017 appealed to all faithful to avoid use of non-biodegradable items in graveyards and feasts. The letter to parishes discouraged the use of “toxic” and “unnecessary” materials like plastic, thermocol, foam and silver foil, and director of Caritas Fr Maverick Fernandes appealed to Catholics not to use these. That year, the appeals were read out in churches and signs pasted at cemeteries. The chief minister at the time, Manohar Parrikar, had also ordered a crackdown on the use of plastic during government functions, and refused to accept bouquets of flowers in plastic wrapping when invited as chief guest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/prayers-more-important-than-fancy-grave-decor-parishes-ask-catholics-to-go-green/articleshow/87409431.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Ahmedabad||Dholka industries need to revive lake: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has said that it wants five industrial units near Dholka town to save and revive a lake near Bhetavda village and sought response from the industries on this issue. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati has sought reply from the industries and directed the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to get in touch with the industries and work out the modalities for remediation of the waterbody. This was in response to a PIL filed in 2018 by residents of three villages — Bhetavada, Trasad and Nesda — who complained that the improperly treated sewage water from Dholka nagarpalika’s sewage treatment plant (STP) is discharged in the waterbody. Moreover, only 70% of Dholka’s sewage gets treated and 30% waste water is discharged directly. The villagers complained that apart from the discharge from STP, the water gets contaminated by chemical waste. This has not only contaminated waterbody but also ground water and it has become difficult for them to use water for drinking and irrigation purposes, said petitioner’s advocate Hardik Shah. The high court had ordered four companies — Concord Biotech Ltd, Cadila Pharmaceutical, Vasa Pharmachem Pvt Ltd, and Gimatex Industries — to be impleaded as parties in the litigation. They have refuted the allegations that water has been contaminated because of their discharge. On October 26, GPCB filed a report and submitted that remediation measures for Bhetavada lake need to be initiated by industrial units. It also named one more unit, Dharamchand Ultrachem Pvt Ltd, which should be asked to help clean the waterbody. Besides, GPCB informed the HC that Dholka STP cannot function properly because there are frequent power failures in the area. For this, the HC issued necessary directions for uninterrupted power supply so that the treatment plant can function to its fullest capacity and for immediate restoration of power in case of disruption. Further hearing has been posted on November 16.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/dholka-industries-need-to-revive-lake/articleshow/87407726.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Amba ghat to reopen for six-wheel trucks & tempos||KOLHAPUR: Amba ghat, along the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri highway, will be opened for trucks and tempos soon, though multi-axle vehicles will have to wait longer to access this route. The decision has been taken in a meeting between the ministers and officials of both Kolhapur and Ratnagiri districts. The ghat section had been damaged following landslides in July. The section was closed for all traffic for over two weeks. After temporary repairs and patchwork, the ghat section was initially opened for light vehicles. However, over the past three months, no heavy vehicles had been allowed on this stretch. The heavy vehicles were being routed through the Anuskura ghat. But this route is not financially viable for the transporters given the increased distance and rising diesel prices. Daily trade takes place between two districts and the Amba ghat is one of the four ghats that leads to Konkan. The condition of the ghat has now been restored enough for trucks and tempos to ply on the section. Vinayak Raut, MP of Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg constituency, announced that the ghat section will be opened for six-wheel vehicles such as tempos and trucks. Multi-axle heavy vehicles, however, are still banned along this section. “The transporters demanded that traffic on the ghat be resumed for trade. A decision has been taken to open it for six-wheelers after discussions with the authorities. The work to restore the ghat has been completed. Now, the trade between the two districts too will resume.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/amba-ghat-to-reopen-for-six-wheel-trucks-tempos/articleshow/87404888.cms||---
---||Pune||Not quiet, but Deccan still awash in greenery||PUNE: Had the Deccan Gymkhana not experienced a funds crunch after hosting the trials of the first ever Indian contingent to the 1920 Summer Olympics, held in Antwerp, Belgium, the residential area adjacent to it — the Deccan Gymkhana colony — might not have come up. “A lot of money was spent on the Olympic trials, held at the Deccan Gymkhana, following which there was not much money left with it. So, the patrons decided to raise funds by selling some of the land owned by the gymkhana as residential plots at premium rates in 1921. The distribution of plots started on October 31, 1921, which we now consider as the start of the colony,” said Anantbhushan Ranade, an oncologist and a colony resident, whose grandfather settled in the area in the early 1930s. Even with renovations, new developments, wider roads, and a plethora of shops and restaurants, the colony, located just metres from the hustle and bustle of the bus terminus and surrounding roads and markets, appears to be an oasis of greenery. The entire area is now simply known as Deccan. The mornings still bring sports enthusiasts to the tennis and basketball courts, and the advent of the cricket season draws young cricketers to the nets, and even to the picturesque Deccan Gymkhana ground for matches. The state Ranji Trophy team has also hosted numerous games at the venue over the years. The landmark sports complex aside, the bungalows, which incorporated elements of both colonial and Indian architecture, with cobblestone facades, and exquisitely-carved pillars exuded old-world charm. These bungalows started housing a burgeoning middle class of civil servants, doctors, teachers, and others, who wanted a better life away from the increasingly congested old city on the east bank of the Mutha river. “Because of the well-planned roads, the architecture, and the facilities at the colony, people from the old city used to come to the area to have a look,” said Kishor Godbole, member, Deccan Gymkhana Colony Panchayat, which was established to look into the needs and issues of residents living in the area. However, many of the old bungalows are now gone, having made way for apartment blocks. “The area’s greenery has been maintained, but too many vehicles move through our locality now. So, the peace and quite of the residents is mostly gone,” said Sanjeev Abhyankar, a classical music exponent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/not-quiet-but-deccan-still-awash-in-greenery/articleshow/87406340.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav questions Amit Shah’s claims on govt’s promises||LUCKNOW: Six rebel Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs and one sitting legislator from the ruling BJP formally joined the Samajwadi Party in Lucknow on Saturday. After inducting the seven MLAs into the party fold, a visibly pleased SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said the ruling BJP should now change its slogan from ‘Mera parivar BJP parivar’ to ‘mera parivar bhaagta parivar’. The BSP MLAs who joined the SP included Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Sushma Patel, Aslam Chaudhary, Hargovind Bhargava and Aslam Raini. All six were suspended from the BSP in October 2020 for anti-party activities after they came in contact with the ‘backroom boys’ of the SP with plans to shift loyalties. BJP MLA from Sitapur, Rajkesh Rathore, who has been vocal against his own government for quite some time on the issues of law and order and handling of pandemic, also joined the SP. Talking to reporters, Akhilesh questioned the claims of Union home minister Amit Shah that BJP has fulfilled 90% of the promises it had made in the Sankalp Patra (manifesto) ahead of the 2017 assembly polls. “On the very first page of the Sankalp Patra, the BJP promised that farmers’ income will be doubled. Has it been doubled,” he asked. Citing the document, he said the BJP promised to strengthen the system of mandis to help farmers sell their produce easily but the government increased the rate of fertilizers, electricity and fuel and left the farmers to fend for themselves. Reading aloud a point in the Sankalp Patra where BJP promised to connect district headquarters with proper four-lane road network, Akhilesh said there was not a single district where this promise had been fulfilled by the BJP. “On the contrary, the BJP government did away with the separate head that the SP government had created to connect places of religious importance with proper four-lane roads,” he said. Waving a copy of the Sankalp Patra to point out that the BJP had promised laptops, tablets and 1GB internet data free, Akhilesh said, “I am not sure which tablet were they talking about.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/akhilesh-questions-shahs-claims-on-govts-promises/articleshow/87410872.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

NHAI has written to both Ghaziabad and East Delhi administrations suggesting that the team should have representatives from local administration, police, PWD or any technical wing, NHAI, the private concessionaire and supervision consultant of the project. “We have written to the district administrations seeking this assessment as the stretch had been heavily barricaded by police and occupied by the protesting farmers. We don’t know the extent of damage done to the stretch. We had informed the local administration on earlier occasions that the impacted stretch is in ‘danger zone’. We have to be sure that the stretch is safe for commuters,” said an NHAI official. He added that they want the joint assessment team to quantify the loss and damage to the project, how much time it will take to complete the repair and whether the stretch is safe to allow vehicles. The official said they were unaware whether any structure or any of their parts have been damaged, which can pose a risk to the commuters. Earlier, the authority had flagged how the impacted project stretch due to the farmers’ protest had been damaged. They had occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Expressway since November last year and put up their tents and dais. The Delhi Police had also put up barricades, which they have started removing from the site.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/nhai-to-assess-damage-to-meerut-e-way/articleshow/87411574.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Muslims in Haveri village offer prayers in Kannada||HAVERI: Muslims all over the world generally offer their prayers in Arabic language, but in Chihkka Kabbar in Haveri district, they pray in Kannada at the Hazrat Mehabob Subani Darga. The village, in Rattihalli taluk, has done this for about 150 years. Most of the 400 Muslim families don’t know Urdu and Arabic, so the maulvi addresses the community in Kannada five times a day. The Muslims are proud of the local language and live in harmony with other communities in the village, which is in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s home district. According to sources, in the last decade, children have started learning Urdu in school. The mosque, however, has display boards outside and inside that are in the Kannada language. “Most Muslims don’t know Arabic and Urdu in Chikka Kabbar village so there is no point using these languages during prayer. However, previous maulvis had addressed in Kannada because it is easy to communicate with people of the community as they easily understand prayer and discourse. I have also followed the tradition,” said Mohammad Peeransab, the current maulvi. He said that non-Muslims also listen to the Kannada prayer discourse in the village. “There is no importance in the language, the intention is in understanding the theme of the religion and importance of the prayer,” Mohammad added. Hussensab Billalli, the chairman of the Anjuman Islam Committee, concurred with the maulvi on having prayers in Kannada. There was no use of Arabic and Urdu in the mosque during prayer because the people cannot follow a religion without understanding it. The Kannada language is easy to understand in the community, even by the unlettered, Billalli pointed out. “People in our village live in harmony. There is no difference between Hindus and Muslims in our village. Hindus participate in our festivals and we also join our hands with Hindu ritual practices,” he said. “Our elders three generations back had donated a three-gunta site to construct a mosque in our village and I registered the property with the Anjuman committee recently. There is no dispute in language. We easily understand their prayers and discourse because it is in our mother tongue. Here, no difference of opinion in religion exists and we live in harmony,” said Veeranagouda Patil, who has donated land to the mosque.

He also went on to say that attempts to make Goa a coal hub would be opposed tooth and nail. Interacting with the fishing community at Dando beach on his arrival from the airport, Gandhi said environment cannot be destroyed in the name of development and called for efforts to have sustainable development in the state.

I will make sure that if Congress is elected in this beautiful state at no point it will be allowed to become a coal hub.” Highlighting the need to keep Goa free of pollution, Gandhi said, “When my mother (Sonia Gandhi) is sick, she likes to come to this place. When I bring her here, she feels happy and healthy. This goes same with every person who wishes to come to Goa. So, I shall be protecting its environment for every individual that comes here, and of course for Goans.” Gandhi, while responding to questions, said that, “Development is important, but when it comes to Goa, what is more important is balance. Balance between rich and poor, balance between sustainable development and environment, balance between anything and everything that the government does. It should not be that only a couple of rich businessmen take benefit and everyone else suffers on account of them earning more.” Referring to what is seen in the country, Gandhi said that Congress wants to fight in its own way. “Congress believes in every individual has a right to get his space. If BJP gives its hatred, division and instability, we respond to it with love and affection and unity”. Calling for unity, he said, “We need to stay united and show our power, that will be the best answer to the BJP regime. If we need to end the BJP then we need to stay united”. “Whatever I speak here will become my guarantee and when in the ruling, all my assurances will be delivered or else I won't be able to face you'll. I want every Goan to wholeheartedly give their suggestions for our manifesto so that we reach out to fulfill all wishes of Goans,” Gandhi said. The local fishing and toddy tappers community members raised issues like illegal fishing by Karnataka fishermen, hike of fuel prices, fishermen staying in coastal areas not getting permissions to rebuild their houses but big projects like five-star hotels coming up in CRZ areas. The toddy tappers community complained of cutting down of coconut trees in the name of development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-wont-allow-goa-to-be-coal-hub/articleshow/87410900.cms||Ruvina Khan

The minimum temperature has been below freezing point in all the polling stations of Spiti valley and many polling stations of Lahaul and Pangi valley. Many villages are still covered with snow. Voters in the upper parts of Kullu, Mandi, Kinnaur, and Bharmour also braved chilling temperatures.  However, the sunny day brought some relief to the people, who were seen basking in the sun outside the polling booths. Covered with snow, Tashigang has 47 voters, including 29 male and 18 female voters, and all of them used their franchise. “I was so excited to use my vote for the first time. I’m happy that our polling station was made a model polling station and all the voters used their franchise,” the first-time voter from the village Tashi Chhojong said. Lahaul-Spiti is the coldest district of Himachal, where many villages are covered with a thin blanket of snow. Wearing heavy woollen and traditional dresses, the residents had started thronging the polling booths from 8 am. Most of the voters turned up to cast their vote before mid-day. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner-cum-district  officer Neeraj Kumar said voter turnout in the district has been 55 percent. “Elections completed peacefully. The temperature in the district is very low after the recent snowfall. Despite this, the elderly, women, and youths have shown great enthusiasm. The roads to all the polling stations were clear of snow,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/in-tashigang-temperature-at-10c-turnout-at-100/articleshow/87409466.cms||---

The fare hike by private bus operators follows a similar move by the state-owned MSRTC, which increased fares by 17% on all its routes. Kiran Desai, the working president of the Pune Bus and Car Owners’ Association, told TOI, “The decision was taken during our convention on Friday. The fuel prices have skyrocketed and we have no choice but to increase our fares, which are based on the fuel price rise. The new fare structure is set to come into effect from November 1.” The increased per km rates will be applicable to private luxury buses, school and office transport buses as well as tourist vehicles. On Saturday, a litre of petrol was selling for Rs 114.28 in Pune city, while diesel was being retailed at Rs 103.71 per litre. “There are several bus classifications as per their seats and whether it is air conditioned or not. The Pune district has buses from 13 seats to 43 seats and all their rates have been revised. Buses and cabs will not be able to ply on old rates,” Rajan Junavane, president of Pune Bus and Car Owners’ Association, told TOI. In private cabs, a ride on a six-seater car from Pune to Mumbai will now cost Rs 4,500 instead of Rs 4,000 earlier. Travel on a four-seater car to Mumbai will cost Rs 3,000 instead of Rs 2,800. “The per km charges, which were between Rs 16-17 earlier, have now been fixed at Rs 18. Cab aggregators like Ola and Uber don’t come under this as their fares shoot up automatically during peak hours or on popular routes,” another association member running a private cab service said. Many commuters blamed the government for the price rise. “It is festive season and the prices are so high amidst our limited income that we cannot sustain. If the cost of travelling is going high, transporters cannot be blamed. The government is to be blamed for the high fuel costs,” Anish Date, who travels frequently between Pune and Mumbai, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/public-transport-fares-shoot-up-on-increasing-fuel-cost/articleshow/87406353.cms||Joy Sengupta

The vehicle production at these plants is expected to get affected due to the semiconductor shortage. “Owing to a supply constraint of electronic components due to the semiconductor shortage situation, the company is expecting an adverse impact on vehicle production in the month of November 2021 in both Haryana and its contract manufacturing company, Suzuki Motor Gujarat Private Limited (SMG) in Gujarat,” Maruti Suzuki said in a filing with BSE. Terming the situation as quite dynamic, the country’s largest carmaker noted in the filing that as per current estimates the total vehicle production volume across both the locations could be around 85% of the normal rollout. SMG Gujarat, which supplies vehicles exclusively to Maruti Suzuki, has an installed production capacity of 7.5 lakh units per annum. Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales slipped 54.9% to 68,815 units in September from 1,52,608 units in the same month last year due to shortage of electronic components.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/maruti-suzuki-sees-adverse-impact-on-production-in-nov/articleshow/87407767.cms||---

Sambhajiraje said for last two years, no exam was conducted for recruiting civil servants. The recruitments were cancelled due to the state government;’s poor financial situation following the Covid pandemic induced lockdown. Sambhajiraje said, “Recently, Maharashtra State Public Services Commission declared exam after a gap of two years. Many students, most of them from general category and some from reserved categories, were disqualified as they had crossed the maximum age limit. It is injustice.” He said students prepare for years hoping to get into civil service and chances of many have been limited as no exam was held for two years. “Therefore, I have written to the CM to relax age related criteria by at least two years to give back the students the opportunity they lost due to pandemic,” he said. Sambhajiraje added that many other state governments have relaxed the age criteria for the students appearing for their state civil services exam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/relax-age-limit-for-civil-service-exam/articleshow/87404886.cms||---

Credai-Pune Metro added in a statement that home prices may rise by around Rs300-400 per square foot, driven by rising prices of cement, concrete, etc, which have risen by around 50-60% between 2019 and 2021. “Rising prices of essential materials used in construction work like steel and cement, along with labour and transportation charges, has led to a sharp rise in construction costs. The cost of affordable housing projects is also expected to increase significantly,” said Anil Pharande, president of Credai-Pune Metro. The organisation had previously appealed to both the state and Union governments to sort out supply bottlenecks, also alleging that manufacturers of some construction inputs were engaging in cartelization.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rising-steel-cement-costs-may-make-homes-dearer-credai/articleshow/87376023.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Double whammy: Amid pandemic, Covid-dengue co-infections in Punjab||Chandigarh: Amid the ongoing pandemic, around 50 cases of Covid-19 and dengue co-infection have been reported in Punjab — cases where patients have tested positive for both Covid and dengue. Some co-infected patients have dominant dengue (an illness caused by dengue viruses), while Covid — a respiratory illness caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 — is the dominant co-infection in others. As the majority of cases of Covid are asymptomatic, health experts have warned that in a setting of co-infection, the combination might enhance the severity of both the diseases. The outbreak of dengue during the ongoing pandemic has increased the pressure on doctors, as it is not easy to distinguish symptoms because of the overlapping clinical presentations of both the diseases. “Timely diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to avoid devastating complications of severe forms of co-infection,” said Dr Gupta, who also laid emphasis on reconfirming the dengue serology in Covid-infected patients to avoid false positivity. Dr Gupta also called for a need to develop an accurate point of care testing for prevention from both diseases. Punjab has reported an unprecedented number of cases of dengue cases this year. The state has already surpassed the previous highest of 15,398 dengue cases recorded in 2017 by registering 16,129 cases. Besides, 61 suspected deaths have been reported till October 30. From 2018 to 2020, the state had witnessed a steady decline in dengue cases. Mohali tops the list with 2,531 cases, followed by 2,114 people testing positive for dengue in Bathinda, 1,504 in Hoshiarpur, 1,489 in Amritsar, 1,479 in Pathankot, 1,242 in Muktsar and 1,198 in Ludhiana. Dr Gagandeep Grover, Punjab nodal officer for vector-borne diseases, attributed the surge in case to increase in testing, prolonged monsoon and lack of public participation. Against 18,000 tests conducted last year, the health department has collected and examined 40,680 samples so far this year. Dr Grover rued that during inspections conducted by different teams of the government, collection of water was spotted in a majority of homes, which became a perfect breeding place for mosquitoes. “The government is making every possible effort and the public needs to reciprocate by taking all precautions and keeping the surroundings clean,” said Dr Grover. Covid beds for degnue patients With the steep rise in the number of dengue cases putting a pressure on health infrastructure, the health department has authorised government hospitals to use beds reserved for Covid-19 patients for those suffering from vector-borne diseases. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar shared that the bed occupancy for Covid had dropped significantly due to a decline in daily caseload. He said beds reserved for Covid cpi;d be used for treating dengue patients whenever required. As per data of the health department, 9,357 oxygen beds out of 9,565 were vacant as of 5pm on October 30, while 1,541 of 1,596 ICU beds were unoccupied .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/double-whammy-amid-pandemic-covid-dengue-co-infections-in-punjab/articleshow/87409469.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Kanpur||2 IAF men, 1 more test positive for Zika in Kanpur||KANPUR: Two more Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel and a civilian from Kanpur tested positive for Zika virus on Saturday, raising the virus count to four in Uttar Pradesh. On October 23, a 57-year-old IAF warrant officer, who’s currently being treated at the Air Force Hospital here, was the first to contract the virus in UP. A resident of Pardewanpurwa Pokharpur, his samples were earlier sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune. A high alert has been sounded at Hanger No. 7 & 8 of the maintenance command of IAF station, Kanpur, along with neighbouring civilian pockets. On Saturday, samples of all three — the two IAF personnel and the civilian — tested positive at KGMU lab in Lucknow. While the two IAF personnel are in their thirties and residents of Adarshnagar area of Chakeri, the civilian is 41 years old and is from Shyamnagar area of the locality. They have been isolated and are being treated at the Air Force Hospital. With three localities of Chakeri, where the IAF station is housed, in Zika grip, Kanpur district magistrate Vishak G Iyer and chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh rushed to the Air Force station on Saturday with a team of health department and civic officers to control the spread of the mosquito-borne disease. Health infrastructure has also been ramped up at Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital to treat Zika patients. Civic authorities have been directed to conduct an intensive drive to stop breeding of Aedes mosquitoes in and around the Air Force station. Talking to TOI, the DM said: “More than 260 samples of IAF personnel and residents of Pardewanpurwa Pokharpur, Adarshnagar and Shyamnagar areas of Chakeri were dispatched to the KGMU laboratory. On Saturday, the Lucknow lab confirmed three more samples as Zika positive. One of the three was found to be asymptomatic.” Doctors said the first Zika patient was stable and 22 people related to him had all tested negative for the virus. To track the source of Zika virus and check its spread, 74 health department teams had on Friday collected samples of nearly 204 people, including 29 pregnant women and 85 Air Force personnel from across 11,493 households of Chakeri. The exercise was supervised by experts from Delhi and Lucknow. On Thursday, the health department had taken blood and urine samples of 175 Indian Air Force personnel and 76 civilians and dispatched them to KGMU lab for confirmation of Zika, malaria or dengue, said, Dr G K Mishra, additional director, medical health and family welfare, Kanpur. On October 25, a high-level multidisciplinary team comprising an entomologist, a gynaecologist and public health specialists from National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, National Centre for Disease Control and RML Hospital, Delhi, was sent by Union health ministry to Kanpur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/2-more-iaf-personnel-civilian-contract-zika-in-kanpur-tally-four/articleshow/87410875.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Chandigarh||Public discourse by top brass in social media era||India has recorded phenomenal mushrooming of think tanks, with a 120% increase in their numbers in the past three years. As per global rating agency, India currently has 507 think tanks, narrowly surpassing China. USA with 1,871, tops the list. Notwithstanding the quantitative growth, we lag in qualitative terms, particularly regulatory frameworks for discussion and dissemination of information and more importantly, follow up is lackadaisical. The problem has been compounded by live social and electronic media coverage. It has resulted in statements made by senior armed forces hierarchy being utilised to whip up TRP fuelling controversies. Recently, very incidental remarks by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) have attracted unwarranted attention. Unfortunately, net result is that audience hang on to few controversial bytes, forgetting the core issues. Top brass in pre-social media era had the luxury of protection of Chatham House Rule, which applied to deliberations, wherein participants were free to use ideas and information but without attribution. This rule was designed to enhance freedom in articulation and enable discussions on controversial ideas. Anonymity promoted some new and seemingly outlandish projections, later finding acceptability after debate. The rule originated in June 1927 in premier think tank, Royal Institute of International Affairs, based in Chatham in London. While on the verge of extinction, it is worth recounting the edict, “When a meeting or part thereof is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.” The rule was conducive for compliance for print media, as editors could exercise discretion. Currently, even newspapers are constrained, to ‘keep up with Joneses’, of digital media. It is indeed worrying that on two occasions, The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has chosen to contradict CDS’s very relevant remarks. The first instance was when his suggestion to engage with the Taliban, while answering question in Raisina Dialogue in 2018, was dubbed by MEA as his personal opinion. In all probability, we have maintained some back channel or ‘track-two’. The current situation is forcing us to accept ‘realpolitik’ of dealing with the Taliban. In effect, it is proving that CDS was not wrong. Much touted strategy of ‘not engaging’, besides being undiplomatic is both impractical and counterproductive. It also doesn’t cater for situational dynamism, with shifting goal posts. In second instance, peripheral remarks of CDS during discussion on Higher Defense Management at IIC got unnecessarily highlighted. He alluded to possibility of convergence between Sinic and Islamic civilizations, as predicted by Samuel Huntington, in his widely acclaimed seminal theory. These remarks were again discounted by diplomats, to assuage Chinese hierarchy, on the eve of parleys. Diplomats on both occasions could have been more discreet by invoking Chatham House rule, reiterating that what is stated in think tanks is essentially part of academic discussion. More importantly, remarks in these instances were not related to central theme of deliberations. The view points articulated by the Generals are curated by institutional bodies, like Perspective Planning Directorate, manned by selected officers. These invariably go through three to four levels of scrutiny. They are certainly not ‘off the cuff’ variety. Within the services, it is often the Army brass, which attracts controversy. Perception gaps are indicative of absence of inter-ministerial coordination. COAS, probably as abundant measure of caution referred to MEA bulletin, in recent conclave. It will be important, if ministry pro-actively pushes information rather than usual bureaucratic ploy of introducing vetting by MEA, thereby adding another link. Public disowning of remarks of Army hierarchy is demoralising for juniors and sends negative message. It needs to be avoided. It is indeed baffling that Chinese sensitivities trigger such knee-jerk response. Diplomacy is based on quid pro quo, it is high time they are told to stop blatantly trampling ours. Even more worrying is not being able to put across to Chinese that concerns on collusion with Pakistan are real and subscribed by large section of knowledgeable security professionals. Soldiers often get caught up in ambiguity of grey zone due to their binary approach. Diplomats on the other hand are trained in art of balancing. Our first exposure to this dichotomy was a talk by then foreign secretary in Staff College in 1989. We were enthralled specially with liberal dose of anecdotes. Next day, Admiral Raja Menon gave us reality check. We were asked to write down five new things learnt. He allowed us the liberty of collaborative, syndicate solution. We couldn’t write any thing beyond ‘Panchsheel’, which we had learnt in high school. Most relevant lesson learnt was that art of telling stories is critical component of public speaking, specially to steer clear of controversies. It is no wonder that in conclaves and TV debates, diplomats fare much better than veterans. It is different matter that diplomats leave most debates open ended. It will be apt to recall an old maxim: diplomat saying yes means may be, may be implies unlikely, and if diplomat says no, he is not a diplomat. For soldiers, it is yes for yes, no for no and may be means he is getting politicised. Demise of Chatham House Rule will lead to more ‘in-camera’ debates. It is already sprouting culture of captive think tanks defeating their very raison d’etre. Events in Afghanistan and testimony of Gen Mark Milley underscore the need to give due credence to military viewpoint. Suitable correctives need to be applied for meaningful discourse.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/public-discourse-by-top-brass-in-social-media-era/articleshow/87409475.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Prosecution begins with examining neighbour in Narendra Dabholkar murder case||PUNE: The prosecution in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case began on Friday with the examination of Avinash Davalbhakt (54), a neighbour of the slain anti-superstition activist. He is also one of the two witnesses the police had engaged during a search of Dabholkar’s flat in Shaniwar Peth after the murder on August 20, 2013. Davalbhakt’s deposition on oath before special judge SR Navander marked the beginning of the much-anticipated trial. Special prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi initiated Davalbhakt’s examination in chief and defence lawyers Virendra Ichalkaranjikar and Prakash Salsingikar did the cross-questioning. In a related development, the court passed an order directing the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in New Delhi to prepare and handover copies of a CD of the victim’s postmortem to the CBI and further to the defence lawyers. The court also directed the CFSL, Mumbai, to provide the x-ray plates of the postmortem. This was done after Suvarna Avhad, one of the defence lawyers, moved a plea stating that the defence had still not received a CD of the postmortem proceeding. The court involved the Delhi CFSL after noting that Mumbai and Pune facilities were not equipped to prepare copies of the postmortem CD. The court further allowed lawyer Omkar Nevagi a plea on behalf of Dabholkar’s son, Hamid, seeking court’s permission to allow him to assist the prosecution in the trial. Complainant and the then assistant police inspector Narayan Rangat, who was among the first to reach the scene of crime, will be examined at the next hearing on November 13. Avhad also moved another plea relating to the CBI’s operation with the help of a foreign agency to search a firearm in the Thane creek. Till Friday evening, the court had not passed an order on this plea. All the five accused were present before the court on Friday. Key accused Virendrasinh Tawde, Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar were brought to the court from the Yerawada central prison, while Vikram Bhave and Sanjiv Punalekar, who are out on bail, appeared on their own. Suryavanshi started by asking Davalbhakt questions related to how he became a part of the search process by the police at the victim’s flat. Davalbhakt deposed that he was called to the flat by the then police inspector Raghunath Phuge and that he entered the flat simultaneously with the other witness Krishna Khedekar. Davalbhakt deposed that he met Khedekar (an employee of Dabholkar’s Sadhana Printing Press located nearby) for the first time on that occasion. He also deposed that he was Dabholkar’s neighbour and lived in the apartment building from 2008 and 2014 before moving to his present residence in Dattawadi. He said Dabholkar would visit his flat , which is in the name of Sadhana Printing Press, once or twice a week.

---||Kolkata||Salt Lake roads remain battered and bruised||Kolkata: Over a month after the last spell of heavy rains, roads in Salt Lake remain battered. Though Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) had taken up patchwork repairs prior to Durga Puja, it has remained unfinished due to intermittent rains. The road in front of Bidhannagar North police station; a stretch of First Avenue near tank no. 5; and Karunamoyee are among the worst affected with huge craters leaving motorists in grave danger. Residents who live around these areas and motorists who negotiate these stretches regularly said it was a perennial problem around this time every year with the civic authorities carrying out patchwork repairs that don’t last. This year, waterlogging in several stretches of the township has left more road stretches in a shambles. “The authorities should consider laying mastic asphalt on these stretches. The damaged top layer of the road surface makes it accident prone. Only patchwork is not a solution,” said Dipannita Bakshy, a resident of BL block. “It is just hurriedly done patchwork which gets washed away in the rains. An additional layer of bitumen is being put on top of the battered bitumen top which is only raising the road level above the ground level of houses, resulting in waterlogging during heavy rains,” said Anamika Poira Paul, a resident of CE Block. “During each monsoon the same spots being repaired turn into large craters. In some places, patchwork is done just by laying some bricks and putting a single bitumen layer on the damaged surface to save on costs. Concrete roads are the only long term solution,” said Dipankar Mitra, a resident of CL block. Some common main road stretches that repeatedly get damaged each year are the stretch from Udaychal Tourist Lodge to Purta Bhavan, the stretch from police housing to Baisakhi island, on the Broadway and near tank no. 10. This apart, most of the roads inside the blocks are in terrible condition after rains. Locals said there are a few places like Amul Island intersection beside Salt Lake stadium which has always been vulnerable to cave-ins due to weakened soil underneath the road caused by constant water seepage during heavy rain. The civic authorities often fence off a portion of the road due to cave ins. BMC authorities said they had carried out patchwork before the Pujas, but all the damaged roads in the township could not be covered in time due to the frequent heavy rains. “Work was hampered due to the heavy rains. Rain was occuring just after patchwork which was getting washed up again in places. The work is being resumed,” said BMC board of administrator chairperson Krishna Chakraborty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/salt-lake-roads-remain-battered-and-bruised/articleshow/87407853.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Brisk business in malls on last weekend before Diwali||KOLKATA: City malls recorded decent footfalls on the last weekend before Diwali with stores selling gift items and jewellery doing a brisk business. With Dhanteras scheduled on Tuesday, stores selling jewellery are looking forward to brisk sales beyond the weekend. For other retailers, there will be a bit of lull after this weekend before sales of winter wear picks up towards mid-December. But restaurants are looking forward to a good turnout on Bhai Phonta on November 6. City Centre I in Salt Lake that usually witnesses good turnout in the run-up to Diwali due to the presence of multiple branded jewellery stores had a steady stream of shoppers on Saturday. Though there are large standalone jewellery stores in the neighbourhood, the preference for shops in the mall is primarily driven by ease of parking cars and access to more shops under one roof. While jewellery is a must-buy around Diwali among a section of shoppers, purchase of household items has also gained currency over the years. At South City, kitchenware and furnishing stores did brisk business as did a few apparel stores. “This is the last lap of major shopping prior to Christmas and customers turned out in fairly good numbers. Though it wasn’t as much as we had witnessed before Durga Puja, it was higher than what the mall used to witness before Diwali,” a South City official said. The other category that moves during this season is gifts. From dry fruit hampers to imported chocolates to bags, watches and phones, premium stores in Quest Mall did good business with customers spending without reservation. “Diwali and Dhanteras are considered to be auspicious occasions to buy new things. There has been a surge in sales in jewellery brands and gifting outlets. We at Acropolis Mall hope to exceed last year’s sales during Dhanteras and Diwali period by 45% and touch 2019 sales figures,” said Acropolis Mall general manager K Vijayan. At Gariahat and Chandni, stores selling LED lights, different types of lamps and other Diwali and Kali Puja decorations saw heavy rush as people purchased decorative lights after realising that they would not be able to purchase crackers this year following the High Court order banning all types of fireworks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/brisk-biz-in-malls-on-last-weekend-before-diwali/articleshow/87407790.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Davkhare told the media on Saturday the campaign which went viral soon after NCP MLA Nawab Malik’s Friday press conference (claiming Gosavi, who was recently arrested, was a stakeholder in his family enterprise) was false. He said there are two different people by the same name and a microbiologist called Kiran Gosavi is a director in his wife’s company. Davkhare said he was considering filing a complaint with cyber police. Meanwhile, Pune police lodged a new case against Gosavi and a woman on Friday for allegedly cheating three men of around Rs 4 lakh on the pretext of offering them jobs abroad in 2020.

It will return to its weekday timetable from Monday, running as many trains as it can, to follow physical distancing in pandemic times. Eastern Railway (ER), which runs Sealdah and Howrah stations, and mostly caters to suburban lines connecting these two divisions, will run 634 services along Sealdah and 350 along Howrah on Sunday. From Monday, ER will follow weekday schedule — with around 800 trains on the Sealdah line and 380 from Howrah. South-Eastern Railway (SER), which only operates around 190 EMUs in its suburban section, starts with 49 services on Sunday, but hopes to run its full fleet within the next fortnight. The state on Friday issued a notification allowing suburban trains, suspended for public use since May 6, to resume with 50% passengers from Sunday. Even as SER will have a phased restart, ER is in favour of running its entire fleet of around 1,400 trains to ensure distancing in the coaches. In fact, divisional railway managers of Sealdah, Howrah and Asansol have been given a free hand to run maximum number of trains. On Saturday, S P Singh and Manish Jain, DRMs of ER’s Sealdah and Howrah divisions, respectively, conducted meetings so that most EMUs could be back on track next week.

In a statement on Saturday, Ramadoss said that the MSME trade and investment promotion bureau (M-TIPB) called for a bid to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for establishing the petrochemical cluster. The objective of the cluster is to set up petroleum and chemical-related business units around the 90 lakh tonnes capacity refinery being constructed by the Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) in Nagapattinam at an estimated cost Rs 31,580 crore, said Ramadoss. He said that the proposed site falls under the protected special agriculture zone. On the other hand, the PMK leader quoting news reports said that the government officials did not fine any issues in implementing the project since petrochemicals is not banned in the protected zone. “It shows that the intention of the Tamil Nadu government officials is towards attracting the investments instead of safeguarding the agriculture and environment,” said Ramadoss. The PMK leader recalled the proposal of the AIADMK government to establish a petrochemical cluster on 57,345 acres in 45 villages in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts at an estimated cost of Rs 92,160 crore in 2017.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/abandon-petrochem-cluster-plan-pmk-to-govt/articleshow/87409493.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Consensual sex with major girl is not an offence, but is unethical: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Rejecting the bail plea of a person accused of raping his girlfriend along with another accused, the Allahabad high court has said that “having consensual sex with a major girl is not an offence, but is unethical, immoral and against established Indian norms”. Justice Rahul Chaturvedi, while dismissing the bail plea of Raju, one of the accused in the case, said that it was the duty of the man claiming to be the boyfriend of the girl to protect his girlfriend when she was being sexually harassed by the co-accused. “The moment the applicant submits that the victim is his beloved, it was his binding duty to protect the dignity, honour and reputation of his girlfriend. If a girl is major one, then to have sex with her consent is not an offence, but certainly it is unethical and immoral and also not in consonance with the established social norms of the Indian society,” the court observed. The court termed the applicant’s act as “highly deplorable and unbecoming of a boyfriend”, stating that “he remained a silent spectator when the co-accused persons were brutally sexually assassinating his beloved in front of him and no effort to put a stiff resistance was made by him so that the soul and body of the victim could be saved from further butchering by these flesh vultures”. On February 20, 2021, an FIR was lodged against four accused under sections 376-D, 392, 323, 504, and 506 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 5 and 6 of POCSO Act at Akil Sarai police station of Kaushambi district. As per FIR, the victim, at around 8 in the morning of February 19, went to take stitching lessons at a stitching centre and had spoken to her boyfriend Raju over phone and planned to meet him. Later they meet at a secluded place near a local river. After some time, three other persons reached there, abused and beat the applicant Raju and snatched his mobile and committed the crime with the victim. After examining the material placed on record and the contents of the FIR, the court in its decision dated October 21 denied bail to the applicant, stating that it cannot be said with certainty that the applicant had got no association or connection with remaining co-accused persons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/consensual-sex-with-major-girl-not-an-offence-but-unethical-hc/articleshow/87409649.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

As things stand, vaccine beneficiaries are required to register themselves on the CoWIN portal using their mobile number and a government-issued identity card. “Since these people do not have mobile numbers or documentation, we are organizing the special drive,” deputy collector and coordinator for the vaccination programme Ganesh Misal said. The drive is being conducted by way of special sessions or using certificates issued by the local gram panchayat. “There is a ‘special session’ option for the people without identity (PWI) cards, under which the mobile number of a local elected representative or a similar person is used. The session is created and then, individual identity proof is not required,” said Dr Shailesh Nikam, the taluka health officer of Nashik, who oversees vaccination in the district. This way, several people — either those in shelter homes, group of beggars or even migrant workers — can be clubbed together and given the vaccine. There is a second process in case the numbers are too low. “We take a certificate regarding the beneficiary from the gram panchayat and use its outward number as his/her identity. The mobile number can be of any elected representative, health officer or worker,” said Dr Nilesh Sonawane, the taluka health officer of Malegaon. The authorities said that 500 such people have been vaccinated across the rural Nashik so far. A similar drive is yet to begin in Nashik city. “We have carried out vaccination in old age homes so far. Post-Diwali, we will conduct more special sessions,” Dr Ajeeta Salunke, immunization officer of NMC, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-500-without-ids-got-jabs-in-special-drive/articleshow/87404916.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Director of NRCB S Uma and SP Sethu Subbaiah of Cake Bee exchanged the MoU at the institute on Friday. The technology called foam mat drying – a low-cost novel technology developed by the institute, could be a feasible solution for producing cost-efficient banana powders from ripe and market rejected bananas. Being transferred first time to a Tamil Nadu-based entrepreneur, NRCB termed the technology a boon to small capital sensitive food industries. Uma said that the initiative will change the way banana is being handled and may give the well-needed publicity and quality products to the consumers.NRCB said that Cake Bee will use the flour and powder made from banana to produce food items in addition to their regular products. Uma also said that it may also end the price fluctuations and reduce post-harvest loss. A very short shelf life of 2-3 days, leads to greater post-harvest loss of ripe and over ripe bananas. To overcome these difficulties, technologies on making of flour from green banana and powder using low-cost foam mat drying was developed by the institute.The inventors of the technology, scientists P Suresh Kumar and K N Shiva expressed that banana, a crop of choice for Trichy under one district one product (ODOP) scheme is the best choice of fruit for making healthy processed food products.NRCB said that the initiative will enable them to deliver quality and healthy choices of food to the consumers and diversifying the product portfolio with innovative food options of their bakery chain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/nrcb-transfers-tech-to-bakery-chain-to-use-banana-flour/articleshow/87409490.cms||---

A formal order issued by the board said during Diwali and Guruparab, fireworks will be permitted only between 8pm and 10pm. For Chhath, revellers can burst crackers from 6am to 8am, whereas on Christmas and New Year, people can do so only between 11.55pm and 12.30pm, reads the order, issued by the board’s member secretary, Y K Das. An official of the board said, “We have adopted the similar model that was enforced last year.” He said the rule will apply to all districts where pollution levels were found to be within satisfactory limits. “Last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruled that crackers can be burst only in those places where air and sound pollution levels are found to be within the prescribed limit. In Jharkhand, pollution levels at almost all places are within the range so far. Hence, crackers have been allowed, but only for the two-hour window,” he added. The pollution board has also banned the sale of crackers that have a sound limit of over 125 decibels. “Sale and bursting of crackers with noise level only up to 125db will be permitted. It is up to the district administration concerned to ensure that crackers beyond those limits aren’t sold,” another official said. The sale of crackers has already started in the capital city early this week. The district administration has earmarked a handful of places, namely Morhabadi, Harmu, Bariatu and Jaipal Singh Stadium, for retail sales of the crackers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-residents-get-2-hrs-for-crackers-on-diwali/articleshow/87407433.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||PM-Pope meet brings hope to faithful||Ranchi: Missionaries in Jharkhand are optimistic that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s maiden meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican in Rome on Saturday will usher in a new beginning of trust, cooperation and inclusiveness for them in India. The missionaries also hoped that the meeting will end the “smear campaign” and “witch-hunting” against them allegedly by BJP and other Right-wing groups, who they said often accused leaders of the Church of forcibly converting the tribals. On several occasions, the Church has raised issues of intolerance in BJP-ruled states. In Jharkhand, where Sarna and non-Sarna (Christian Advisasis) have always been a contentious issue, the previous BJP government between 2014 and 19 led by Raghubar Das had been highly critical of the missionaries and brought in anti-conversion laws after accusing them of duping the poor and illiterate tribals. The BJP regime even ordered probes against various entities led or owned by the missionary organisations to block foreign funding. Amid the backdrop of such issues in recent years, the PM’s meeting with the Pope is being viewed with great curiosity. Talking to TOI, the auxiliary bishop of Ranchi, Theodore Mascarenhas, said, “Not only just for the Church but we hope that the meeting turns fruitful for the whole nation. We don’t know the two great leaders discussed behind the closed door, but we hope that when our Prime Minister returns, it will set a new beginning where India once again becomes the champion of love, tolerance and peace. We also hope that he brings in with him the determination to bring us back into that fold where everyone respects each other. All these traits have always been our tradition of this country.” Mascarenhas, who is also the spokesperson of the Ranchi Diocese, maintained that the PMO had contacted his office before Modi’s Rome visit for pointers on discussions with the Pope. “We are grateful for that,” he said. He added that the Christian community is always peace-loving and demanded that all issues of dharamantaran (conversion) that is often raked up by “some forces” need to stop. “While some call it as witch-hunting, I have often called it as persecution. I am sure the Holy Father (Pope Francis) will express whatever concerns are required to be raised before the PM and the meeting will be for everyone’s betterment. From our end, we consider our PM as a balanced person, who talks about sabka saath, sabka vikas. In that context, we hope that the meeting will help stop all such negativity surrounding us to some extent,” he said, adding that the Christian community is only looking for freedom to serve the people of this country as it has been doing so for ages. Notably, the PM is on a two-day visit to Rome for the G20 Summit at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Besides Modi, many other leaders of G20 countries met the Papal separately. The PM will also head to Glasgow in the United Kingdom for the COP26 meeting from Rome.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/pm-pope-meet-brings-hope-to-faithful/articleshow/87407492.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The comprehensive curriculum specifies exact details of the academic activities to be conducted each day in the AWC and my department will provide relevant support and resources needed for successful implementation of the curriculum.” The launch was attended by the director of social welfare, Anjaneyulu Dodde, state project director of Jharkhand Education Project Council Kiran Kumari Pasi, state head of Unicef Prasanta Dash and educationist Parul Sharma, among others. Dash said that global research has indicated that children who go through positive, engaging and encouraging experiences at home or at early childhood development centres or Anganwadi kendras in the first six years of their life are less vulnerable to psycho-social problems, addiction or self-harm. “Such children are more likely to complete the cycle of education and make a successful transition from adolescence to adulthood. There was a need for holistic planning to ensure that nutrition, health, psycho-social well- being and education go together to provide a solid foundation to the kids in their early years,” he added. Dodde underlined the need for strengthening monitoring at the field level for ensuring implementation of this unique curriculum. “Serious measures need to be planned to address nutrition and early learning-related loss induced by the pandemic,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-releases-curriculum-for-early-childhood-education/articleshow/87407957.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The experts believe that there is a bleak chance of a steep rise in cases in the near future. However, hospital authorities have been asked to be ready to tackle any further spread of the virus. Public health expert and professor of community medicine at RIMS, Dr Dewesh Kumar, said: “The results of the last sero prevalence report are very encouraging, and 70 per cent of the total population has developed antibody as per the report. So, the relaxation isn’t going to hurt much. Also, the new AY 42 strain is also not of much concern as it doesn’t have high transmissibility like the previous ones. The vaccination drive has also helped people to develop antibodies, so there is no problem in relaxing the norms.” Dr Kumar added that as the weather is changing and pollution levels are likely to increase, people should be more cautious and continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviours. Even as experts supported the state government’s decision to relax norms, hospital managements and doctors said they are continuing with their preparations for a suspected rise in Covid-19 cases. Medical director of Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica Super Speciality Hospital, Dr Vijay Mishra, said: “There are chances of rise in Covid-19 cases post festival amid relaxed norms, but we are gathering all our resources for the same. We have sensitised our staff to identify suspected patients through screening so that it doesn’t affect other patients.” Professor (critical care) and head of the New Trauma Centre at RIMS, Dr Pradip Bhattacharya, also echoed Dr Mishra’s view and said: “We haven’t been asked to let our guards down when it comes to preparations, and even now, we have three patients who turned negative after a week-long treatment. The state government has relaxed norms for common people, but we are continuing with our preparations. Three floors remain reserved for Covid-19 patients at the New Trauma Centre.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/slim-chance-of-rise-in-cov-cases-despite-relaxed-norms-experts/articleshow/87407161.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The move comes in the wake of reports that minerals mined illegally were transported by the railways during the period, thereby causing huge revenue loss to Jharkhand. Talking to TOI on Friday Singh said, “It has come to our notice that illegally mined stone chips are being transported to faraway places from different railway sidings located in Santhal Pargana. It hints at connivance between the suppliers and the railway officials. It results in huge revenue losses to the state exchequer.” He stressed that the revenue lost will be realized after the railway officials submit the details which have been sought from them. On October 25, Singh wrote to the district mining officers (DMOs) and reminded them to follow the set of instructions which were issued earlier this year. The directives focused on curbing illegal mining of coal and stone quarrying and their transportation. The previous directives were issued to the DMOs in July. “It is due to your involvement that the state exchequer is incurring huge revenue losses because of rampant violation of mining and transportation regulations,” Singh wrote in his letter to the railways. He also directed the DMOs to initiate legal steps to levy financial penalties from the violators after conducting section measurement exercises of the mining units and lodging FIRs against those who are operating such illegal stone quarries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-hints-at-railways-transporting-illegally-mined-minerals/articleshow/87407862.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

A formal order issued by the board said during Diwali and Guruparab, fireworks will be permitted only between 8pm and 10pm. For Chhath, revellers can burst crackers from 6am to 8am, whereas on Christmas and New Year, people can do so only between 11.55pm and 12.30pm, reads the order, issued by the board’s member secretary, Y K Das. An official of the board said, “We have adopted the similar model that was enforced last year.” He said the rule will apply to all districts where pollution levels were found to be within satisfactory limits. “Last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruled that crackers can be burst only in those places where air and sound pollution levels are found to be within the prescribed limit. In Jharkhand, pollution levels at almost all places are within the range so far. Hence, crackers have been allowed, but only for the two-hour window,” he added. The pollution board has also banned the sale of crackers that have a sound limit of over 125 decibels. “Sale and bursting of crackers with noise level only up to 125db will be permitted. It is up to the district administration concerned to ensure that crackers beyond those limits aren’t sold,” another official said. The sale of crackers has already started in the capital city early this week. The district administration has earmarked a handful of places, namely Morhabadi, Harmu, Bariatu and Jaipal Singh Stadium, for retail sales of the crackers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/state-residents-get-2-hrs-for-crackers-on-diwali/articleshow/87414771.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Ranchi emerged as the leader for its work on 49 indicators, which included health and nutrition, education, agriculture and basic infrastructure among others. Niti Aayog listed the rankings on its Champion of Change portal. Elated by the Centre’s recognition, Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan said, “We had given our best to tackle the pandemic on priority in the last two waves despite the limited resources. We had also tried to restore the welfare programmes for the people.” He added, “As most of the healthcare workers, including sahiyas, ANMs, GNMs and community health officers were deployed on Covid-19 duty, our compliance with the routine immunization came down. Later, we rationalized the manpower and deputed them back on a regular healthcare programme. We also added 250 new anganwadi centres across the districts under the NREGA scheme. The total number of such centres has now increased to 1850. We also completed 4,000 new PMAY houses in the district .” Aspirational district fellow Puja Kumari said restoration of the routine immunization was one of the factors for bagging the top rank. “Increase in institutional deliveries, restoration of anti-natal checkups and resuming civil construction work also helped us fetch the top spot,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/ranchi-ranks-1st-among-aspirational-districts-in-country/articleshow/87408225.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Speaking to TOI at his residence in Hazaribag, Sinha said, “I welcome the apex court’s decision for a court-monitored probe into the illegal surveillance issue. While the opposition leaders have been asking for a probe and answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in Parliament, the PM has remained silent on the ground that it involves national security.” Sinha was among the group of people who moved the Supreme Court seeking a thorough probe into the scandal. The group had said the Pegasus snoopgate violated the privacy of the citizens in the country. The former Union minister also equated the “tapping of phones” with the Watergate scandal in the United States of America. “When the Watergate scandal broke out, the then US president Richard Nixon had resigned. But here, Modiji will neither quit nor resign and even if the scandal proves true, someone or his cabinet will digest all the allegations,” he claimed. “Modiji can only be ousted if he loses the elections. Unless there is a strong united alliance of the opposition, it will not be easy to defeat Modi or BJP in 2024,” he added. On the rising fuel prices, Sinha blamed the Centre, citing its “faulty economic policies”. He said, “The alarming thing is that the hike in prices of fuel has a direct effect on the price of essential commodities.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/yashwant-likens-pegasus-row-to-watergate-scandal/articleshow/87407375.cms||Abhijit Sen

The expelled members have also threatened to “erase traces” of the party in Chatra district. Among those expelled are a former district president, a former vice-president and a former spokesperson. They were expelled on charges of anti-party activities, including insulting minister Hafizul Hasan, who was in charge of the JMM’s Chatra district unit. Earlier, the expelled members had claimed that they were the real party office-bearers of the district unit and demanded the ouster of Pankaj Kumar Prajapati, the district president. It is also evident that the 12 expelled members were supporters of Sita Soren, the eldest daughter-in-law of Shibu. Sita has been at the forefront of the demand for the ouster of Prajapati. She had also announced the formation of Durga Soren Sena, named after her late husband, Durga Soren, “to save JMM from dishonest people and touts”. Criticising the party's decision to expel them, Rajkhishore Kamal alias Pinku claimed that disciplined and dedicated workers of the party are now replaced by touts. He said, “We have been associated with JMM for the last 25 to 35 years. Now, we are shown the doors. This is gross injustice and the result will not be positive for JMM. Chatra main party ka namo nishan mita denge. (We will erase any traces of the party in Chatra). Pinku further said they have formed a committee of the Durga Soren Sena during a meeting on Saturday Purana Dharamshala Bhavan and he was selected as convener and spokesperson of the Sena in Chatra. He added, “JMM in the district is now known for corrupt practices in which leaders right from senior state leaders to those in Chatra are involved. To counter this from within the party, the Durga Soren Sena was formed. Those who are not getting a place and respect for their hard work in the party will get their due recognition in Durga Soren Sena.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/expelled-jmm-members-join-durga-soren-sena/articleshow/87407773.cms||---

The directives came while hearing a petition filed by Bhushan Shingne (No 3427/2000) and others where amicus curiae Anup Gilda pointed out lack of efforts on the government’s part in RSS procurement. Additional government pleader Deepak Thakre informed that it would be in the interest of the public that the present tender process is cancelled and a new one is floated for its procurement and installation. “We direct that an appropriate decision regarding re-tendering be taken within seven days. If a decision to re-tender the matter is taken, a new tender shall be floated within two weeks and the whole process shall then be completed within four months,” a division bench comprising Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare said. “As there are several advantages of RSS and some unique features attached to it, it would be necessary for the state to take efforts in the direction of installation of RSS at the earliest. If this is done, millions of patients from central India would stand to benefit immensely. We are hopeful that this system would also help in training young generation of surgeons,” the bench added. The justices pointed out that on one hand, there is a grievance of patients that RSS, though promised, is not being installed for the last several years and on the other, there is something which is holding back the authorities from going ahead with the project at the desired speed. “We are of the opinion that these issues can be sorted out if the agencies concerned come together at one table, discuss the problems being faced and sort them out together as early as possible. For this purpose, it would be necessary for these agencies to convene a meeting and make a suitable decision,” they said. In the last hearing, HC had directed experts to convene a meeting and discuss issues responsible for delay in completion of RSS tender process. Accordingly, they met at DMER’s office in Mumbai and took up the issues for consideration. A copy of minutes of the meeting with some documents was later submitted in the court. The judges told the government that if any financial sanction for enhanced amounts of the tender and technical clearance for any modified specifications are required, those should be granted by the departments concerned preferably within a week. “If any additional funds are required to be provided, it should be done without any delay. Those would be in addition to the funds already directed to be reserved for RSS procurement and installation as per our October 21 order,” they said.

He was demanding Rs 10 lakh from a kin, threatening of dire consequences by impersonating as an Ethiopian gangster. Police said Teltumbde had watched YouTube to learn the tricks of concealing one’s number and replacing it with an international one while making calls or messaging someone. He had downloaded an app for executing the plan. Police said Teltumbde, a resident of Kaushalya Nagar, plotted to extort a substantial amount from his kin who works for a multinational company with a hefty pay package. Teltumbde, using the app, started sending threatful messages to the relative from a number of Ethiopia. He had sent messages to harm him and his family if Rs 10 lakh was not sent to a designated place by October 27. After Wadi police referred the complaint to the cyber cell, it was handled by Asst PI Keshav Wagh who immediately alerted the WhatsApp nodal officer. After receiving information from WhatsApp and mobile phone service provider, Wagh and his team had zeroed in on Teltumbde.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/man-arrested-for-bid-to-extort-rs-10-lakh-from-kin/articleshow/87408198.cms||Soumitra Bose

The matter came to light on Saturday when some locals noticed murky water in the river. “Since Saturday morning, Kanhan water had turned milky white. When the residents tried to find out the reason, while patrolling upstream, they noticed a stream of ash flowing out from the ash pond of the Khaperkheda Thermal Power Station (KTPS) into Waregaon drain,” said the residents, who wished not to be identified. They also shared the photographs of a nullah containing ash-laden water flowing into Kanhan river. TOI has snaps and videos shared by the locals. It was confirmed by sources in the power plant that due to technical snag, ash from the pond accidentally got released into the outer drain of Waregaon, which flows into Kanhan river. As the Kanhan water treatment plant (WTP) cannot treat ash-laden water in the river, pumps located on the right bank stopped functioning. Due to this, the WTP operated at only 50% capacity from Saturday noon till late evening. This unexpected interruption in Kanhan pumping caused less and low-pressure water supply in the command areas connected to Kanhan feeder main. NMC’s water works department too confirmed that water supply to 28 elevated storage reservoirs in four zones — Ashi Nagar, Lakadganj, Satranjipura and Nehru Nagar — was disrupted. During regular round of ash handling, the plant team came to know about whitish discharge flowing toward Kamptee Road bridge and it was observed that ash filter on the nullah was in completely collapsed condition, KTPS undertook remedial measures on war footing, said KTPS chief engineer Raju Ghuge. He also said in a couple of days new Nandgaon ash bund would be made operational to reduce burden on Waregaon bund. In the past too, KTPS had been in the news for discharging polluted water in Kanhan. Activist Anil Wadpalliwar and AAP leader Pratap Goswami had exposed similar happenings in the past and TOI had been highlighting this. Environment activist and founder-director of Centre for Sustainable Development Leena Buddhe said this is blatant violation of norms by the KTPS and all at the cost of lives and livelihood of the people. “Health of all living beings is being compromised. Strict action needs to be taken by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and MoEFCC,” she said and pointed out that this needs to be stopped or we all are doomed. Kanhan river is the main source of drinking water for Nagpur and also to all villages around the power plant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ktps-fly-ash-in-kanhan-river-hits-water-supplyto-half-of-nagpur/articleshow/87408232.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Thousands of fans had begun trickling into the stadium since Friday evening to catch a final glimpse of the 'Power Star' as the final rites were expected to be conducted on Saturday. With the government postponing the funeral to Sunday, many more made it to the stadium to pay their tributes to the 46-year-old actor who passed away after a massive cardiac arrest. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the funeral procession would take place between 5.30am and 6am on Sunday and the general public will not be allowed during the last rites. He urged the actor's fans and admirers to cooperate with the administration to maintain law and order as they have in the past two days. Condolences and tributes to Puneeth flooded social mediaPuneeth’s maternal uncle and former Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce president, SA Chinne Gowda, who was at Kanteerava Studio overseeing preparations for the final rites, said: “...Even today, people have been pouring in from across the state, from far off districts like Kalaburagi, Raichur, Belagavi and many other places. It has been decided that the final rites will be performed tomorrow (Sunday). I request people to cooperate and maintain peace.” Puneeth’s elder daughter, Drithi, who is studying in New York, took an AI flight from JFK and landed at Bengaluru at 4.10pm, via Delhi. Earlier in the day, Puneeth’s brother Raghavendra said the family was waiting for Drithi to arrive and appealed to fans to remain calm. “You have all cooperated and maintained peace so far, we request you to do the same. All fans will be allowed to pay their respects as we’ve pushed the final rites to tomorrow morning,” he said. Drithi reached the family’s Sadhashivanagar home around 5pm and arrived at the Kanteerava Stadium by 6pm. Joined by her mother Ashwini and sister Vanditha, touched her father’s head one last time and wept, sending a wave of grief through the crowd in the stadium. Among celebrities and VIPs who called on the family through the day were former Andhra Pradesh CM and thespian NTR’s son Balakrishna, Telugu megastar Chiranjeevi, actors Venkatesh, Junior NTR, Ali, Rana Duggabati, Srikanth and Sharath Kumar. Kannada stars Arjun Sarja, Divya Spandana (Ramya), Rakshitha, Pooja Gandhi, Sudeep, Yash, Upendra and senior artistes Umashree, B Jayashree and music director Gurukiran also paid their respects. Karnataka governor Thawar Chand Gehlot arrived in the morning to pay tributes. Police said the throng of fans in the stadium remained all day, while a few hundreds more thronged Kanteerava Studio. Police commissioner Kamal Pant said: “Our officers estimate around 5 lakh people arrived by midday. Many more people kept pouring in even after that. There will be bigger crowds by night and up to morning tomorrow.” Despite the huge numbers, no untoward incident was reported though fans had to brave a brief spell of rain at 4pm. Online, condolences and tributes to Puneeth flooded social media. A video of a fan (Ajmal Mughal) from Pakistan’s Lahore crooning the actor’s ‘Bombe Heluthaithe’ even went viral.

With a Mensa IQ score of 162 — the highest possible — Rucha also secured bragging rights over her elder brother Akhilesh who, in 2016, had scored 160 in the same test. It’s widely believed that Albert Einstein had an IQ of 160. Back then, the Chandorkars were living in Nagpur and TOI had reported about Akhilesh’s achievement. In 2019, the family moved back to Scotland where parents Rutwik and Sonali had spent a good part of their professional career. While other youngsters have cracked Mensa earlier, there are no reported stories of siblings with Indian roots achieving such phenomenally high marks. Though thousands of IQ testing platforms are now available with varying scoring range, Mensa’s IQ score is the undisputed leader among them. For Rucha, the entire Mensa thing started in 2016. “Bhaiyya scored 160 in Mensa and he featured in a lot of interviews with the media, so I used to think that when I turn 11, I too will appear for the test,” said Rucha. The results declared in the last week of September were definitely a surprise. Rucha said, “I was expecting 130 and hoping for more. But when I saw 162, I was overjoyed.” With a bonus of two marks over her brother’s score, Rucha is convinced she won’t be the little sister who can be pushed around now. “Yes, I will keep rubbing it in, I guess,” laughs Rucha. Akhilesh said, “Yes she’s already started doing that. So every now and then, she will say ‘hey, I am smarter than you’. But I remind her that I have five years more experience.” Rutwik and Sonali, both from IT background, had no doubt that Rucha was a gifted child. “We were able to pick up these signals as she was doing things that were beyond her age. Solving puzzles, riddles to academics, Rucha always displayed a brilliant streak,” said Sonali. Rutwik said, “She has always looked upon Akhilesh as a role model, so it was kind of natural that she too attempted the Mensa test.” Rucha has a lot of interest in illustrations and drawing and hopes to explore this as a career. Akhilesh is interested in maths and physics, with a special focus on space exploration. What is MensaFormed in Oxford in 1946 by Roland Berrill, an Australian barrister, and Dr Lance Ware, scientist and lawyer, the organization spread around the world. Membership is restricted to the top 2% of the population by IQ.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/11-yr-old-girl-ups-brother-in-global-iq-test-ties-highest-score/articleshow/87408244.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Davkhare said on Saturday the campaign which went viral soon after NCP MLA Nawab Malik’s Friday press conference (claiming Gosavi, who was recently arrested, was a stakeholder in his family enterprise) was false. He said there are two different people by the same name and a microbiologist called Kiran Gosavi is a director in his wife’s firm. Meanwhile, Pune police lodged a new case against Gosavi and a woman on Friday for allegedly cheating three men of around Rs 4 lakh on pretext of offering them jobs abroad in 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-links-with-gosavi-bid-to-malign-party-image-bjp-mlc/articleshow/87413000.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka bypolls: Hangal records same turnout as in 2018, Sindgi sees a minor dip||BENGALURU: Voters on Saturday turned out in large numbers in the byelections to two assembly seats of Hangal and Sindgi. The overall turnout in both seats was around 76.5% at the time of going to press. While Hangal recorded same voter turnout as it did in 2018, Sindgi with 69 % witnessed a two percent dip in polling when compared to previous elections. Nearly 4.4 lakh voters are eligible to cast their votes in these elections necessitated due to the deaths of sitting MLAs MC Managuli from Sindgi and CM Udasi from Hangal. In all, 19 candidates are in the fray in both constituencies - six from Sindgi and 13 from Hangal. Two candidates from Sindgi are women. Counting of votes is on November 2 "The bypolls passed off peacefully without any major incidents. Whenever any discrepancy was brought to our notice, we took prompt action to rectify it," said election officials. Slow start The polling, which started on a slow note at 7am, picked up pace by 9am. A majority of voters turned up in the last three hours. People were seen standing in long queues before to cast their franchise. Candidates of all three parties voted with their family members. In Chandkavate village in Sindgi taluk, there was a minor verbal altercation between Congress and BJP workers over distributing voters' slips having the picture of Congress candidate Ashok Managuli. After police recovered and destroyed the slips, the situation was defused. Though results of these bypolls don't have much political significance, ruling BJP, opposition Congress and JD(S) ran spirited campaigns, in all holding over 600 rallies and meetings in both constituencies. Parties believe the outcome here will set the tone for the 2023 polls. This is the first electoral challenge for chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. Retaining Hangal is important for him as it is adjacent to his Shiggaon assembly segment which falls under Haveri district. The Congress, by ensuring a win, wants to give momentum to its preparations in the run-up to the 2023 assembly polls in the state, while JD(S) is looking to retain Sindgi seat and prove it still has a support base in north Karnataka. Bommai, opposition leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC president DK Shivakumar held over 30 rallies each in both constituencies. JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda and former CM HD Kumaraswamy had camped in Sindgi constituency for over 10 days to drum up support for their candidate despite the party being on a weak footing. Former CM BS Yediyurappa too vigorously campaigned for his party candidates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-bypolls-hangal-records-same-turnout-as-in-2018-sindgi-sees-a-minor-dip/articleshow/87413293.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Average groundwater level up by 2.78m in Marathwada||AURANGABAD: The monsoon of 2021 has lifted the mood of residents of the Marathwada region with the groundwater level rising by 2.78m at the end of September, as compared to the average water level of the past five years. A Groundwater Survey and Development Agency (GSDA) report on Saturday revealed that all 76 talukas in the eight districts of Marathwada had witnessed a spike in the groundwater level with Latur, one of the highest water deficit districts from the region that had to be supplied water by trains in 2016, reporting the highest 4.37m increase. GSDA deputy director Bhimrao Meshram said the surplus rainfall observed across Maharashtra during the outgoing monsoon had increased the level of underground water. "It is one of the record rises in groundwater level in Marathwada in the past decade. The increased water table will suffice the needs of drinking water and other purposes till the next monsoon," he said. Latur was on top of the list in terms of hike in groundwater level at 4.37m, followed by Parbhani (3.94m) Osmanabad (3.85m), Beed (3.16m), Jalna (2.5m), Aurangabad (2.11m), Nanded (1.21m) and Hingoli (1.16m), the data revealed. The GSDA, as a part of its groundwater level assessment exercise, surveyed 875 dug wells across different talukas of Marathwada. "Some of the wells surveyed were almost filled to the brim and water can be taken out in bucket with hands. In September, we had reports of water spilling out on its own from a few hand pumps from the region. Such rise in groundwater level can ensure almost year-round supply of water through borewells for drinking and agriculture needs," Meshram said. The GSDA, however, has appealed to residents for the judicious use of water highlighting the vagaries of the monsoon. In 2019, 46 talukas from Marathwada had reported drop in the groundwater level due to the deficient monsoon. Contrary to its dubious distinction as a drought-prone zone, Marathwada has received 1,112mm rainfall so far since June 1, which is 153% of the expected showers. In terms of month-wise rainfall, Marathwada recorded 201mm showers in June, which is 150% of the expected showers, followed by 265mm rainfall (142%) in July, 174mm rainfall (90%) in August and the highest 380 mm rainfall (229%) in September, the data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/maharashtra-average-groundwater-level-up-by-2-78m-in-marathwada/articleshow/87413318.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Kolkata||Now, direct flights to Kolkata from Mumbai, Chennai all days of week||KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Saturday allowed direct flights to Kolkata from Mumbai and Chennai on all days of the week, ending an embargo that restricted flights on these sectors to three days every week from September 2020. The government has also changed another important regulation that has been a long-standing demand of the aviation industry. Passengers flying to Bengal will have to undertake an RT-PCR test within 72 hours before their flight only if they have not been fully vaccinated. Flyers from five cities — Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Nagpur — were required to undergo the test irrespective of their vaccination status till now. The move will enable airlines to operate at least 13 more flights from Mumbai and at least 12 more flights from Chennai on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. But it may take a while for these flights to start as aircraft schedules have to be changed. Both are high-density routes and the Kolkata airport can expect a weekly increase of 15,000-16,000 passengers by end-December. Passengers from Mumbai and Chennai had to take flights via other cities to beat the ban on these days. The Bagdogra and Andal airports, too, will benefit from the lifting of curbs. A similar embargo on flights from Delhi to airports in Bengal was lifted in December 2020. Restrictions remain on flights from three cities: Pune, Nagpur and Ahmedabad. With the civil aviation ministry allowing domestic flights to operate at pre-pandemic levels from November, up from the current 85%, the lifting of restrictions on flights from Mumbai and Chennai will help airlines achieve optimum flight movements. Airlines have made several representations to the state government in the past year, seeking lifting of the restrictions, and are delighted with the move. An Airlines Operators’ Committee spokesperson said the move would help meet the high traffic demand in winter and also help travel bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, riding on the back of pent-up demand and growing post-vaccination flyer confidence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/now-direct-flights-to-kol-from-mum-chennai-all-days-of-wk/articleshow/87410761.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee says Congress is the reason for BJP’s TRP, making PM Narendra Modi 'more powerful'||PANAJI: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday blamed the Congress for making PM Narendra Modi “more powerful” and didn’t commit any electoral alliance with it either for the Goa assembly polls in 2022 or the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “Modiji is going to be more powerful because of the Congress. The Congress is the reason for BJP’s TRP. If they (Congress) can’t take a decision, the country will suffer. Why should the country suffer? They (Congress) have had enough opportunity,” the Trinamool chief said, two days after poll strategist Prashant Kishor held that the BJP was to stay for many decades. Banerjee said TMC didn’t want a division of anti-BJP votes and held that the Congress didn’t recognize the need to unite. Keeping the cards close to her chest over an electoral alliance with the Congress, she harped on “working together” with regional parties. “I can’t say everything right now. The Congress in Bengal fought against me (Trinamool) instead of the BJP. Morning shows the day…don’t you think? They contested against me, my party. What do you expect us to do? Give flowers to them?” she said. Banerjee said she was more inclined to “work together” with regional parties to minimize division in anti-BJP votes. “I will give flowers to regional parties instead. I want to see regional parties getting stronger. The federal structure should be strong. Every state must be strong. And if every state is strong the Centre will be strong,” she said. The Bengal CM wanted regional parties to work together after the Congress turned down the offer to ally with Vijay Sardesai’s Goa Forward Party. "I am not going to talk about the Congress because that is not my party. I have a regional party without any support and we are fortunate to form a government with people’s support. I will not talk about any other party. Let them decide,” she said. Banerjee didn’t rule out the possibility of an alliance with Goa Forward Party in the upcoming assembly polls. “I leave it to them to take a decision. We want to avoid division of votes. Regional and local parties can work together and give a fight to the BJP,” she said. But the Bengal CM was silent on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP fielding candidates in Goa when the Trinamool decided to contest in all 40 seats. “I didn’t stop them (AAP) from going to Punjab and fielding candidates there. Why can’t we contest seats in Goa?” she said, adding that Trinamool will go to Uttar Pradesh and Haryana other than the northeastern states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mamata-says-congress-is-the-reason-for-bjps-trp/articleshow/87409084.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dhanteras, a silver lining||Kolkata: Life isn’t perfect, but jewellery can be. It has the power to make one feel unique and there’s always room for some more. No wonder city jewellers big and small are banking on Dhanteras — the thirteenth lunar day of Krishna Paksha when buying gold and silver is considered auspicious — to reverse the pandemic-induced lull in business. Lucrative offers, along with special festive collections, have been lined up to increase in-store footfall as well as online purchases in the run-up to November 2. If industry insiders are to be believed, the scramble for jewellery purchase on Dhanteras started in Kolkata only around a decade ago. “Back then, most people bought silver. Over the next couple of years, the demand slowly shifted towards gold. And now, many buy diamonds as well. The rush begins a week in advance. Customers book early, apprehending an increase in the rates of silver, gold or diamond on the day of Dhanteras. Some even buy wedding ornaments because of the discounts on offer,” said Samar Kumar De, a partner at Guinea Emporium, which has been a retailer, wholesaler and exporter of 22ct gold jewellery since 1982. Ajoy Chawla, the CEO of Titan Company’s jewellery division Tanishq, said they were witnessing “a positive momentum” in consumer mood this festive season. “People are looking to celebrate even small milestones. Pent-up demand, the overall festive spirit and wedding purchases are all converging to create a surge in both gold and diamond categories. We think this will continue beyond Dhanteras and Diwali,” he said. Tanishq’s Diwali bonanza includes up to 20% off on making charges of gold and diamond jewellery. “Our festive collection ‘Utsaah’ features reimagined silhouettes with modern style and traditional motifs in geometric forms. Inspired by the patterns of Indian heirloom crafts, this collection is meant for those women who seek modernity and versatility, and have a discerning eye for designs,” Chawla added. De, who is also the working president of Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee and the COA of All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council, said the jewellery industry was picking up pace for the first time since the lockdown slump last year. “Business is up by 25% as compared to 2020. The focus of buyers is mainly gold jewellery; there is some demand for diamond too. This festive season, we look forward to regaining the lost market share,” he said. A legacy for over eight decades, Senco Gold & Diamonds says its online sales have been going north. “Mydigigold.com — the platform for phygital gold business where the yellow metal is stored on the behalf of buyers and is redeemable against any purchase in the future — is piquing interest. Customers are reaping the benefit of low prices because the platform allows them the flexibility of converting their virtual purchase into physical gold at our retail outlets across the country. Besides, they can also sell the gold using the portal,” said CEO Suvankar Sen. PC Chandra Jewellers is optimistic that the mass vaccination drive and enhanced public awareness about Covid-19 will help the jewellery industry do better this Dhanteras compared to last year. “Many people are now keen to invest in gold. In 2020, the industry had recorded low sales owing to the uncertainty that loomed large over the rollout of vaccines, besides cancellation of weddings, sporadic lockdowns, low customer footfall, dip in production, delayed deliveries, reduced manpower and limited operational hours for offline stores,” said Suvro Chandra, joint managing director of the leading jewellery house that was founded in 1939. Despite the downturn, PC Chandra’s online business gained momentum. “The pandemic has changed consumer behaviour significantly; many people are shopping online. These purchases though include products in the price range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 25,000. The value of jewellery bought by people offline is much higher,” Chandra added. Partha Roy of JK Roy Jewellers feels their festive sales will remain “more or less same” compared to last year. “Most purchases continue to be in the lightweight gold jewellery category. We are looking forward to Dhanteras and hope there will be a pleasant surprise in terms of sales. Our business turnover had reduced by 50% after the Covid outbreak. We are hoping to make a slow and steady recovery,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dhanteras-a-silver-lining/articleshow/87409447.cms||Sarthak Ganguly
---||Kolkata||Cops pull down stage at Abhishek’s proposed meeting venue in Agartala||Kolkata: Barely a day ahead of Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s Agartala public meeting, police on Saturday pulled down the stage at the proposed venue and asked the party to resubmit its plans afresh. On Friday, the Tripura government issued a notification making RT-PCR negative reports (of 48 hours prior to journey) mandatory for arrivals from nine states which had a 5% Covid positivity rate on October 26. Bengal, where positivity rate on October 26 was 2%, was included in this list. Till last reports, there has been no change in Banerjee’s travel plans to Tripura, which includes high-voltage defections of BJP and Congress leaders to TMC. Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev, who has moved Supreme Court seeking its intervention to allow TMC leaders and workers to campaign and contest in the Tripura civic polls on November 25, called this a deliberate attempt by the Biplab Deb government to stop Banerjee. “How else can anyone explain why the Tripura government has suddenly woken up to the Covid fears ahead of Banerjee’s public meeting? Bengal’s positivity rate is not 5%, it’s 2%. Yet, Bengal figures in the list. And on October 29, they made RT-PCR negative reports with a 48-hour validity clause ahead of the October 31 meeting. This only shows that the entire government machinery in Tripura is being used with only one objective — to stop Abhishek Banerjee. That is never going to happen,” she said. Dev in her apex court plea has also sought an SIT probe headed by a retired judge into attacks and vandalism against Trinamool leaders and supporters. Earlier, Banerjee’s Agartala public meeting was denied permission by the Tripura government, which imposed section 144 CrPC citing it to be Covid curbs. TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “They had given permission for this rally and at the penultimate moment they are not only denying permission but pulling down the stage. So, what is the BJP scared off? Weren’t they ridiculing that we will not be able to get enough people at the venue? And now they are reasoning that many people are expected to come here. Let them give a number then, we will invite only that many people.” Party leader Subal Bhowmik said: “We are not going anywhere. We will camp here overnight; the meeting will happen.” Trinamool in a statement said, “Biplab Deb is a coward, and we cannot say this enough number of times! Time and again, he has blatantly misused state machinery to threaten us, attack us and silence us. The silence of the home minister is deafening.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-pull-down-stage-at-abhisheks-proposed-meeting-venue-in-agartala/articleshow/87409035.cms||---
---||Kolkata||All four Bengal bypoll seats record fairly high turnout||KOLKATA: The by-elections to four assembly seats in Bengal on Saturday witnessed a fairly high turnout despite complaints of proxy votes, intimidation of voters and scuffles in front of booths in Khardah (North 24 Parganas) and Dinhata (Cooch Behar). The polling percentage — over time between 11am and 5pm — in Khardah, Gosaba, Santipur and Dinhata didn’t grossly deviate from the same registered during the assembly elections in March-April though the tally at 5pm was a tad lower. Santipur polled the highest of 76.1% and Khardah the lowest of 63.9% till 5pm. Trinamool Congress leader and former Khardah candidate late Kajal Sinha’s son Aryadeep Sinha was roughed up allegedly by personal security guards of BJP candidate Joy Saha, triggering commotion in Bandipur area of the constituency. Trouble broke out in front of the Ideal Academy polling booth in Bandipur in the afternoon after Saha confronted a person allegedly carrying another person’s voter card. Aryadeep, from his private hospital bed, alleged that central forces on duty lathi-charged men in the front of the queue, leaving many injured. “The BJP candidate was falsely accusing a person of being a Bangladeshi voter,” he said. The Election Commission rejected Saha’s complaint as “baseless”. It, however, also ruled out allegations of lathi-charge by central forces and held that the BJP candidate’s guards were at fault. Earlier in the day, Trinamool’s Khardah candidate Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay complained that the central forces were asking for double vaccination certificates from voters. “Who are they? The presiding officer is there to take the decision,” he said. Former CPM MLA from Baranagar Tanmoy Bhattacharya also suffered injuries after stones were pelted at his car near Khardah station. The CPM leader alleged that party polling agents couldn’t reach most booths in Tegharia and Mahispota. In Dinhata constituency, a BJP polling agent deputed at a booth was badly beaten up — and later rushed to the subdivisional hospital — after he objected to alleged “proxy votes” by Trinamool supporters. The BJP’s Dinhata candidate Ashok Mandal alleged that Trinamool supporters barracked him while he went to the booth to cast his vote. Union minister Nisith Pramanik accused Trinamool candidate Udayan Guha of trying to scare away voters. Guha denied the charge. Trinamool leader Partha Pratim Roy asked central forces “to behave with voters” who were “scared” since the April 10 Sitalkuchi firing that left four dead. There were complaints of voter intimidation in Santipur seat too. BJP candidate Niranjan Biswas couldn’t persuade the mother of a party agent to send her son to the polling booth in the morning. She locked her son up in a room after the family received threats the night before. Biswas claimed the house of another BJP agent had been torched. There were no reports of major trouble in Gosaba constituency in South 24 Parganas.

---||Bengaluru||Reluctant actor to businessman, Puneeth Rajkumar’s arc grew with him||BENGALURU: Actor, singer, producer, entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist. Puneeth grew into each of these roles in his lifetime, some with gusto, some with reluctance, but delivered on all of them with great elan. The legendary Rajkumar lauded his son’s national award at the age of 10 as something he himself could not achieve in his acting career but if one asked Puneeth, he might have just shrugged it off and moved on to the next thing. Egged on by Rajkumar and his mother Parvathamma, Puneeth did jump into films at a tender age but he had to be cajoled for every other shot. “He would listen only to me as I knew how to placate him with toys and chocolates. I would enact his role in a shot and he would repeat it. He had said he would act only if accompanied by me,” said Honnavalli Krishna, a character artiste and close associate of Rajkumar. But such was his appeal that filmmakers spun out some 10 movies in quick succession to pair the charming boy with his father. Singing followed acting, and once again, turned out to be a revelation. “We made him sing a few lines in Vasanta Geeta when he was just four and he went on to carve his niche as an actor-singer like his father,” said film director SK Bhagavan. By the time he made his debut afresh as a youngster in 2002 in ‘Appu’, he was dabbling in several things alongside, from business to technical innovations in filmmaking. “He was more interested in adopting modern methods of production to enhance the standard of Kannada filmmaking. Puneeth was the first to introduce the Jimmy Jib camera in 2000 soon after it was first used in Bollywood,” recalled Bhagavan. “However, once he was in front of the camera, he would transform into a different person, become a director’s actor.” Pannaga Bharana, who directed the new-age film ‘ French Biryani ’ f o r Puneeth’s banner PRK Productions, said the actor had prepared a comprehensive plan to take Kannada films to global audiences and to new markets by leveraging digital and OTT platforms. “‘French Biryani’ was the first Kannada film to release on Amazon Prime and it happened because of Puneeth’s vision about the evolving business model. He was the Power Star when it came to acting, but also a powerful businessman when it comes to entrepreneurship,” said Pananga Bharana. His business interests spanned real estate and even hospitality. Despite ruling the roost in Sandalwood, Puneeth took it upon himself to launch fresh talent as well, as seen in content-rich films like ‘Kavaludaari’ and ‘Mayabazaar’. Pannaga Bharana also recalled how Puneeth recently introduced the ARRI LF camera and had planned to purchase a motion-controlled trolley. Those close to him credit his mother Paravathamma not only for his business acumen, but also his philanthropic pursuits. Along with wife Ashwini and sisterin-law Geeta Shivarajkumar, Puneeth patronised Shakti Dhama, an or phana g e in Mysuru for women. “Puneeth had adopted many schools and remuneration for his songs was dedicated to those schools,” added Pannaga Bharana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/reluctant-actor-to-businessman-puneeth-rajkumars-arc-grew-with-him/articleshow/87413645.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ex-Ayodha SSP, 2 others booked for abetting banker's suicide||AYODHYA: The former SSP, Ayodhya, Ashish Tiwari, was booked for abetting the suicide of a woman banker, who was found hanging from the ceiling of her rented room, adjacent to the Sahabganj branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) in Faizabad on Saturday. Hailing from Rajajipuram locality of Lucknow, the deceased PNB deputy branch manager, Shraddha Gupta, 32, would often visit her Lucknow home. Along with Tiwari, a police constable Anil Rawat and a Balrampur resident, Vivek Gupta, have also been booked for abetment to suicide after a complaint was lodged by the deceased banker's father, Rajkumar Gupta, at Faizabad Kotwali police station late evening. Accused named in banker’s suicide noteThe first accused, Vivek Gupta, was scheduled to marry the banker, but the engagement was cancelled in April last year after Shraddha raised questions on his character. All three accused have been named by Shraddha in her suicide note, which was recovered by police, hours after her body was sent for autopsy. The banker had categorically claimed in the suicide note that the two cops and the Balrampur resident were responsible for her suicide. Police said, Shraddha joined as a clerk at PNB in 2015 and rose through the ranks to become an officer in 2018. A spinster, she stayed alone at a rented house, adjacent to the bank branch in Faizabad. On Saturday morning, when the milkman knocked at Shraddha's door and found no response, he informed the landlord. When there was no response after repeated knocking, the landlord peeped through a side window to find her hanging from the ceiling. Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey confirmed to TOI about the FIR.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ex-ayodha-ssp-2-others-booked-for-abetting-bankers-suicide/articleshow/87413873.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Nagpur||Journey of a land: From Alfred Nobel’s co to Gupta Metallics to JNPT and now NHAI||Nagpur: The land at Sindi town, in Wardha district, where Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari is bringing a multimodal logistics park and dry port, was once the site for an ambitious project planned by another politician nearly four decades ago. Senior Congressman and member of Parliament for Wardha Vasant Sathe had mooted a major explosives factory on the same land. This was to be a joint venture with a Swedish company, which traces its roots to Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Originally acquired by State Industrial and Investment Corporation (Sicom) for the explosives project, the land went to Gupta Metallics, a Nagpur company, in 2005, but was taken back by Sicom later. Sicom had tied up with Dyno Nobel of Sweden to make detonators. A new company, Dyno India, was formed. The project could never take off due to high costs involved, said sources. Sometime in 2005, Sicom put the land up for auction. The over 500 acre land parcel was bagged by Nagpur company Gupta Metallics for Rs1.75 crore. A year later, after a change of guard at Sicom, it was realized that the land’s right value was not realized. Gupta Metallics was returned the money and Sicom took back the land. Gupta Metallics had a plan to set up a ferro alloy plant, a multi modal industrial warehouse, and a captive power plant, as well as bio-mass based power plant. The company argues that it was the best rate of the times, arrived at in an open competition. The money remains in Gupta Metallic’s balance sheet in Sicom’s name, as the company still stakes claim on this land. Twenty years down the line, the land was handed over to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) to build the dry port. At that time, Gadkari also held the shipping ministry in his first term as Union minister. The farmers whose land was taken by Sicom originally were paid enhanced amount, according to the latest benchmark. Now, even as promoters of Gupta Metallics continue to cry foul, Gadkari has taken the project under National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). This brings the dry port directly under his ministry again. Gadkari was left only with the road transport ministry in the second term. The project had taken a back seat recently in the second term of Gadkari. Now, a JV has been formed between NHAI and JNPT. The former has 60% stake and will take the work further. Back in 2005, after the land was taken back, Gupta Metallics had planned legal action against Sicom. “A petition was drafted and we had geared up to move court. However, Sicom requested to go in for arbitration. We invoked arbitration but Sicom did not start the process at all. There has been no further development since then. Since Sicom has not gone ahead with the arbitration we have a right to approach the court,” said Vinod Tiwari, a director in Gupta Metallics.

He sought to put to rest the controversy over allegations that Kerala government had forcibly opened the sluice gates of the dam. In a statement, the minister said that there seemed to be some motive behind some media houses misreporting about the operation of the dam. It should be avoided in the interest of both the states, he said. “There is no doubt about the state’s resolve to store water in Mullaperiyar dam at the permitted level of 142ft from November 30, depending on the inflow into the dam,” the minister said. The water level stood at 138.85ft at 8am on Saturday, with an inflow of 3,404 cusecs (cubic feet per second) and outflow of 2,340 cusecs through the tunnel to Vaigai dam and 875 cusecs via spillways. Two shutters of the Mulaperiyar dam have been openedMeanwhile, in a statement, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam raised doubts about the need to release water to Kerala when the storage had not reached the permitted 142ft and districts like Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram were yet to receive water from the dam. He pointed to the opposition from the farmers’ associations and their plans to hold agitation and sought to know if the shutters were forcibly raised by Kerala government. Duraimurugan said Madurai zone of the water resources department decided to raise the shutters of Mullaperiyar dam considering the increase in storage level. Tamil Nadu engineers raised two shutters on Friday morning to release 500 cusecs. The officials concerned in Kerala were intimated in advance as per the standard operating procedure. Kerala ministers and officials were present when the shutters were raised, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-in-full-control-of-mullaperiyar-says-minister-s-duraimurugan/articleshow/87413846.cms||---
---||India||How Iron Man launched India on its milky way||India is the biggest milk producer in the world today but 75 years ago it made a small start on the ‘milky way’ when Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union Limited (KDCMPUL) collected 250 litres of milk from two villages in modern-day Anand. What KDCMPUL lacked in scale, it made up for with zeal. After all, it was not just another business but a call to end the monopoly of Polson Dairy, a private player that had flourished under the British Raj. The ‘movement’ started in 1946 with a farmers’ meeting in Samarkha, a village in Gujarat’s Kaira district. Among the wise heads at the table were India’s ‘Iron Man’ Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, future PM Morarji Desai, and freedom fighter Tribhuvandas Patel, now fondly remembered as Tribhuvan kaka. It was a moment for the history books. (Left) President Rajendra Prasad laying KDCMPUL’s foundation stone in 1954; and Tribhuvandas Patel (right), founder of Amul, with Dr Verghese KurienNot cowed by the RajPolson Dairy had secured the rights to procure milk from the entire Kaira district. It was the first time the British had waded into India’s milk sector. Farmers were angry because Polson exploited them, and they resolved to form a cooperative. Inspired by Patel’s call, KDCMPUL was registered on December 14, 1946, and found its feet under Tribhuvan kaka’s leadership. The nascent movement got a shot in the arm when a young, Kerala-born, Michigan University alumnus landed at the government creamery in Anand to serve out his six-month bond for the government scholarship that had taken him to the US. Dr Verghese Kurien didn’t know he would end up spending his entire life in the town now known as India’s milk city, and become famous as the father of India’s White Revolution. “It wasn’t a career that he chose,” his daughter Nirmala Kurien, 63, told TOI. “He wanted a career in nuclear physics and metallurgy. But my father always said his greatest privilege was meeting Tribhuvan kaka and joining the cooperative movement which gave meaning to his life. A life that he lived on his terms, serving as an employee to farmers. At times, he even sacrificed his salary.” After Independence, the government of India cancelled its contract with Polson and entered into an agreement with KDCMPUL, which decided to establish a dairy of its own. India’s first President, Dr Rajendra Prasad, laid its foundation stone on November 15, 1954, and on October 31, 1956 – Sardar Patel’s birthday – PM Jawaharlal Nehru inaugurated the dairy. Buffalo powerJust 24 hours earlier, Kurien and his team led by dairy tech wizard H M Dalaya, whose family had lost control of Karachi’s largest dairy after Partition, had found a way to make milk powder from buffalo milk. “This breakthrough proved to be a game changer for the dairy industry in India. The dairy industry of developed nations believed that milk powder could only be produced from cow milk,” said RS Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets milk under the Amul brand. Sodhi is from the first batch of Kurien’s other brainchild, Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA). “There were a lot of vested interests. Milk producing countries like New Zealand had snubbed the idea that milk powder can be manufactured from buffalo milk as well. But my father was a man with great foresight,” said Nirmala. Shastri’s Jai KisanHaving cut its milk teeth, KDCMPUL grew rapidly. It set up its first dairy plant with a milk processing capacity of 1 lakh litres per day. The brand Amul, which means priceless in Sanskrit, was launched in 1957. By the mid-1960s, the milk cooperative movement had spread to other districts of Gujarat – Surat, Vadodara, Mehsana and Sabarkantha. But a large part of India was still untouched by the revolution that had started in Anand. That changed after PM Lal Bahadur Shastri came to inaugurate Amul’s cattle feed plant in 1964. He spent a night in a village and learnt the secret of Anand’s success – cooperation. It inspired him to create National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to replicate the Anand model throughout India with Kurien as its first chairman. In July 1970, NDDB officially launched Operation Flood – the ‘billion litre’ idea – that led to what’s popularly known as the White Revolution. By the late-1990s, milk-deficit India had transformed into the world’s largest milk producer, overtaking the US.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-iron-man-launched-india-on-its-milky-way/articleshow/87412720.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Gurgaon||Production, sale of crackers banned in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: The district administration on Saturday imposed a ban on the production and sale of firecrackers other than green crackers. Moreover, bursting of green crackers will be allowed only for two hours during Diwali — from 8pm to 10pm on November 4. The move comes as the city’s air quality index (AQI) was recorded in the ‘poor’ category for the second consecutive day on Saturday. The manufacturing, sale and use of joined firecrackers (laris) has also been prohibited as it contributes to huge air and noise pollution as well as solid waste problems, officials said. Residents can report violations on the toll-free number 18001801817 or send an email to cm9@mcg.gov.in. Only Iicensed traders will be permitted to sell the crackers permitted as per a Supreme Court order. “In case any violation is found in implementation of the order, the SHO of the police station concerned shall be held personally liable,” the order issued by deputy commissioner Yash Garg said. “If any person violates the order, strict action shall be taken under the provisions of law,” it added. Meanwhile, the city’s air quality deteriorated slightly on Saturday. The overall AQI was recorded at 272 on Saturday. It stood at 262 on Friday. According to an IMD official, a marginal improvement might be witnessed in the next two days owing to change in wind pattern, but air quality is likely to deteriorate soon due to unfavourable weather conditions coupled with adverse effects of bursting of crackers. “We are constantly monitoring the situation and coordinating with the departments concerned to check dust pollution and violations of anti-pollution norms. As a precautionary measure, the district administration has imposed a ban on firecrackers which create pollution. People also need to be mindful about bursting crackers and its adverse effects,” a senior official from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/production-sale-of-crackers-banned-in-city/articleshow/87410377.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Rampant open dumping, a stinking problem for Sector 72 residents||Gurgaon: Garbage dumped arbitrarily in front of the housing society, leading to unhygienic surroundings and nauseating stench, has become a menace for the residents of Spaze Privy in Sector 72. Despite complaints to the civic corporation, the problem has persisted with vendors from nearby villages and eateries deliberately and prepensely resorting to dumping solid waste outside the residential society. SP Mathur, vice-president of Spaze Privy’s residents’ welfare association (RWA) said, “The prevailing unsanitary condition could trigger an outbreak of diseases, however, no action has been taken by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) to check the practise. When we complained, a civic official had suggested that we put our security guards on duty to stop these vendors from throwing garbage. But our guards were threatened by the defaulters.” The unpicked garbage, residents claim, attracted stray animals and had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other pests. “The reason why these people keep dumping garbage in the area is that Ecogreen Energy [a private waste management company] charges a fee for door-to-door collection of garbage from each rural household, shops and restaurants. The villagers do not want to pay this amount and hence they dump their garbage opposite our society knowing that the MCG would eventually lift it,” Ratan Kumar Okhandiar, RWA president, said. The MCG, Okhandiar added, should waive off the garbage collection charges from rural households and instead levy a penalty on restaurants and food stalls that don’t have waste contracts. “More than 2,000 people live in the housing society. While we have ensured proper disposal of waste coming from society, we feel helpless as we cannot tackle this nuisance outside our society,” Okhandiar said. MCG joint commissioner (headquarters) Hari Om Attri, meanwhile, said that the corporation has identified 204 garbage vulnerable points in the city where open dumping has been going on. “Efforts are already underway to clear these points. We have deputed nine enforcement teams of MCG, which have been assigned the task of ensuring a proper collection and disposal of waste. We have been issuing challans to unauthorised vendors too,” Attri said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/rampant-open-dumping-a-stinking-problem-for-sector-72-residents/articleshow/87410405.cms||---
---||India||Before the flood, drought of mithai||In the 1970s, Uttar Pradesh had a law that gave a police officer the power to “enter and search any place or premises”. It wasn’t about curbing gun-running, or bootlegging, or prostitution. The ‘UP Milk and Milk Products Control Order’ was all about preventing the diversion of milk to other states, and for other uses, such as the production of paneer and mithai in the summer months. Nor was UP alone in this. In August 1965, West Bengal had banned the manufacture of dairy sweets in Kolkata through the West Bengal Channa Sweets Control Order. Punjab’s milk products control order had come into force in June 1966. The Centre had issued ‘Delhi, Meerut and Bulandshahr Milk and Milk Products Control Order’ in 1969. And in Delhi, wedding hosts weren’t allowed to serve sweets made of “khoya, chhana, rabri and khurchan to more than 25 persons at a time at social functions,” following an order passed in 1965. All of these orders were meant to fight the severe shortage of milk in the summer months when fodder and water for milch animals were scarce. Even otherwise, India was a milkstarved country in the first few decades after Independence. During 1952-55, hardly half a cup of milk (126g) was available per person, per day. In some states, the average daily availability was just 30-50 grams per person. A large part of the country’s milk requirement was fulfilled with imported – often donated – milk powder. On March 29, 1967, this discussion occurred in the Rajya Sabha: Niren Ghosh, MP from West Bengal: “There is dearth of milk powder supply in West Bengal. As a result, the entire milk supply scheme is going to collapse next month, and the children and the mothers are not going to get milk.” S Chandrasekhar, minister of health and family planning: “I know, sir…all the available supplies are being directed to Bihar because of the drought situation…even in Bihar, since the supplies are limited, they are being directed for the use of vulnerable groups of population like nursing mothers and infants and young children.” So, the policymakers of that era had a reason to ban the diversion of milk for all “non-essential” uses, including mithai. “Government are aware that manufacturers of milk sweets will be adversely affected. But milk sweets are a luxury product,” minister of state for agriculture Annasaheb Shinde said in May 1969. Happily, Operation Flood was successful, and at the start of the 1990s you find minister of state for agriculture K C Lenka telling Lok Sabha: “now the ban is on conversion of milk into milk powder and condensed milk only.” Three more decades have passed, and few remember those summers of milk shortage. Now, if a cop knocks at your door, you know he won’t say, “Got milk?”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/before-the-flood-drought-of-mithai/articleshow/87413530.cms||Abhilash Gaur

Officials have been directed to step up the registration drive and generate awareness among the people during this time. So far, over 2,000 Ayushman Bharat cards have been made. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, “So far, 2,038 people have been issued cards under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. We have extended the date of our registration drive and now people can get their cards issued until November 15. The health department and ground workers will be mobilising people to come forward and avail this service at their nearest centre.” During this time, special camps will be organised at the ward and village levels to ensure all the eligible beneficiaries get their health cards. The health department has also roped in Asha workers and volunteers to help in generating awareness among the people and increasing the coverage of the scheme. Registration counters have also been opened at all civil hospitals and healthcare centers. Dr Naresh Garg, deputy civil surgeon of the health department said that citizens whose names are in the list of beneficiaries prepared on the basis of the Social and Economic Census 2011, can get their Ayushman card made by visiting the camps or their nearest centre. A helpline number — 1800-1800-4444 — has also been launched to address the queries of the people seeking registration under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/ayushman-bharat-regn-date-extended-till-nov-15/articleshow/87410428.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chief minister M K Stalin shifts Tamil Nadu Day to July 18, draws flak from PMK||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin on Saturday announced that July 18 will be observed as Tamil Nadu Day. He also said the state government would present Rs1 lakh cash prize each to 110 ‘Border Saviours’ on November 1 to honour their struggle to safeguard the border of Tamil Nadu when the states were formed on linguistic basis in 1956. In a statement, the chief minister said former chief minister C N Annadurai had moved a resolution on July 18,1967, to change the name of erstwhile Madras state as Tamil Nadu. “The state government will soon issue an order to observe July 18 as Tamil Nadu Day,” he said. The previous Edappadi K Palaniswami-led AIADMK government announced in 2019 that November 1 would be observed as Tamil Nadu Day, since it was on this day that the states were reorganised. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala were formed after being separated from the then Madras Presidency following enactment of State Reorganisation Act, 1956. In a statement, PMK leader S Ramadoss said the chief minister’s announcement was unacceptable. “July 18, 1967, the day when the motion was moved in the assembly for name change and January 14, 1969, the day when the law came into effect are significant. Those days could be celebrated separately with appropriate names given their significance but cannot be observed as Tamil Nadu Day. November 1, 1956, the day when the state’s boundary was determined should be observed as Tamil Nadu Day,” Ramadoss said, adding that the present confusion was unnecessary when a lot of work was required to be done for the state’s welfare.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cm-m-k-stalin-shifts-tamil-nadu-day-to-july-18-draws-flak-from-pmk/articleshow/87414118.cms||---
---||World||Minimum corporate tax deal to roll out globally from 2023||The world’s 20 biggest economies (G20) are set to endorse a landmark deal on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and will aim to implement the rules by 2023, a news agency said, quoting draft conclusions of the two-day summit which began on Saturday. “We call upon the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting to swiftly develop the model rules and multilateral instruments as agreed in the Detailed Implementation Plan, with a view to ensure that the new rules will come into effect at a global level in 2023,” the draft conclusions, seen by Reuters, said. It added the conclusions would be formally adopted on Sunday. “Today, every G20 head of state endorsed a historic agreement on new international tax rules, including a global minimum tax that will end the damaging race to the bottom on corporate taxation,” US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, who joined US President Joe Biden in Rome, said. “It’s a critical moment for the US and the global economy.” The deal did fall short of US President Joe Biden’s original call for a 21% minimum tax. Still, Biden tweeted his satisfaction. “Here at the G20, leaders representing 80% of the world’s GDP —allies and competitors alike — made clear their support for a strong global minimum tax,” he tweeted. “This is more than just a tax deal — it’s diplomacy reshaping our global economy and delivering for our people.” Briefing media, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “There are good things to report here. The world community has agreed on a minimum taxation of companies. That is a clear signal of justice in times of digitalisation.” Earlier this month, a major reform of the international tax system was finalised at the OECD that will ensure that multinational enterprises (MNEs) will be subject to a minimum 15% tax rate from 2023. An OECD statement had said that the landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than $125 billion of profits from around 100 of the world’s largest and most profitable MNEs to countries worldwide, ensuring that these firms pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits. It had said that following years of intensive negotiations to bring the international tax system into the 21st century, 136 jurisdictions (out of the 140 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS) joined the statement on the two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. It updated and finalised a July political agreement by members of the inclusive framework to fundamentally reform international tax rules, said the statement. With Estonia, Hungary and Ireland having joined the agreement, it is now supported by all OECD and G20 countries. Four countries — Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — have not yet joined the deal, it had added. The statement had said the global minimum tax deal does not seek to eliminate tax competition, but puts multilaterally agreed limitations on it, and will see countries collect around $150 billion in new revenues annually. Pillar One will ensure a fairer distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises. It will re-allocate some taxing rights over MNEs from their home countries to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits, regardless of whether firms have a physical presence there. Specifically, MNEs with global sales above 20 billion euros and profitability above 10% — that can be considered as the winners of globalisation — will be covered by the new rules, with 25% of profit above the 10% threshold to be reallocated to market jurisdictions. Under Pillar One, taxing rights on over $125 billion of profit are expected to be reallocated to market jurisdictions each year. Developing country revenue gains are expected to be greater than those in more advanced economies, as a proportion of existing revenues, it had said. It said that Pillar Two introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate set at 15%. The new minimum tax rate will apply to firms with revenue above €750 million and is estimated to generate around $150 billion in additional global tax revenues annually.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/minimum-corporate-tax-deal-to-roll-out-globally-from-2023/articleshow/87414131.cms||---

Intervention by the traffic police added to the problem. From morning, politicians and people started queuing up to garland the statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar at Nandanam junction. The crowd spilled over along Anna Salai, with people bursting crackers , often in the midst of stranded vehicles. Police blocked regular traffic between Teynampet and Saidapet. Traffic diversions caused pile-ups all the way to Adyar, Kathipara and Thousand Lights. Motorists spent hours stuck on roads and bylanes, many till late in the evening. Police said traffic jams were cleared after 4pm. They diverted traffic from 7am, anticipating snarls on Anna Salai. At least100 traffic police personnel and 300 law and order personnel were deployed at Teynampet, SIET junction, Cenotaph Road, Chamiers Road, Nandanam, and Saidapet. Additional commissioner of police of Chennai city traffic Pradip Kumar, joint commissioner of police of south Chennai PK Senthilkumari, deputy commissioner of police P Kumar monitored the traffic movements. The police used barricades to prevent people from driving up to the statue at Nandanam. They had to park on the roadsides and walk to the site. This added to the chaos on the roads as vehicles were parked haphazardly, eating into the motorway. Bhama, a resident of Kottur, said: “It took at least two hours for me from Kotturpuram to reach Cosmopolitan Club at Saidapet.” Many said it would have been worse if the event was on a weekday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/thevar-jayanthi-celebration-brings-chennai-traffic-to-a-standstill/articleshow/87414405.cms||---

No country has formally recognised the Taliban government, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets and funds abroad have also been frozen. “Our message to America is, if unrecognition continues, Afghan problems continue, it is the problem of the region and could turn into a problem for the world,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. He said the reason the Taliban and the US went to war last time was also because the two did not have formal diplomatic ties. “Those issues which caused the war, they could have been solved through negotiation,” Mujahid said. Meanwhile, a US government watchdog on Friday accused the state department and Pentagon of suppressing information regarding the collapse of Afghanistan’s former government and military. “The full picture of what happened in August will only be revealed if the information that the departments of defence and state have restricted from public is made available,” said John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (Sigar). A state department spokesperson said Sigar has the authority to restore the reports.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/failure-to-recognise-afghanistan-govt-could-have-global-effects-warn-taliban/articleshow/87414558.cms||---

By 8.15pm, the immunization division attached to the directorate of preventive medicine announced 17.1 lakh people visited vaccination camps. Among these 10.8 lakh people have taken the first dose. The slowdown in vaccinations across the state has often been attributed to a combination of misinformation and mistrust, branded by public health workers in the state as vaccine hesitancy. On Saturday, officials said, rain in many parts of the state brought down attendance in camps. As a result, more than 1.7 crore adults in the state haven’t taken even one dose of the vaccine and nearly 50 lakh are due for their second dose – some of them are due since May. “Most people who haven't been vaccinated are either reluctant, anxious or procrastinating,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Many people who took vaccines over the last one week told TOI that they were forced to roll up their sleeves because of unavoidable reasons. “I am not averse to vaccination. I just didn’t think it was required,” said a senior citizen S Rajeshwari, who took the vaccine at a primary health center in Chennai on Thursday. For months, she and her husband were not willing to take the vaccine, until her son insisted. “He works for a corporate company. His office has made it mandatory for members of the house to get vaccinated. If we don’t take it, he will not be able to go back to work,” she said. People had different ways to reach the vaccination centers on Saturday, but most of them said they made the decision abruptly, after months of inaction. “I got sick of wearing the mask all day at college. I wear them even when I step out with friends for coffee. They keep reminding me to wear it properly as I am not vaccinated. I came here today because I am sick of it,” said a 19-year-old college student, Sakshi A. Vellore-based senior virologist Dr T Jacob John said many people should be encouraged to take this path quickly. “Fresh cases are down; hospitals are empty and there are no longer stringent lockdowns. So, people are probably assuming we are safe,” he said. “Vaccines can stop the new surge. We must get all our vulnerable people covered,” he said. 11 districts report increase in Covid cases:Eleven districts reported an increase in cases on Saturday when the fresh cases in the state dropped to 1,021 from 1,039 on Friday. The state reported14 deaths and discharged 1,172 people from the registry. At the end of the day, there were 11,685 active cases and the cumulative toll tally reached 36,097. On Friday Chennai reported 126 new cases and Coimbatore recorded 118. At least 25 districts reported fewer than 20 cases each on Saturday. With two new cases Ramanathapuram reported the least number of cases followed by three each in Tenkasi and Mayiladuthurai. Of the 14 deaths reported on Saturday, there were three in Coimbatore and two each in Erode, Trichy and Nagapattinam. Chengalpattu, Salem, Kancheepuram, Thiruvarur and Ranipet reported one death each.

---||Erode||Tamil Nadu: Covid vaccination slows, 17.1 lakh get jabs in seventh mega camp||CHENNAI: Two lakh staff, thousands of volunteers, 50,000 vaccination camps, more than 8,000 vehicles in addition to public campaigns and door-to-door canvassing by nurses could bring less than 20 lakh people to the seventh mega vaccination camp on Saturday. By 8.15pm, the immunization division attached to the directorate of preventive medicine announced 17.1 lakh people visited vaccination camps. Among these 10.8 lakh people have taken the first dose. The slowdown in vaccinations across the state has often been attributed to a combination of misinformation and mistrust, branded by public health workers in the state as vaccine hesitancy. On Saturday, officials said, rain in many parts of the state brought down attendance in camps. As a result, more than 1.7 crore adults in the state haven’t taken even one dose of the vaccine and nearly 50 lakh are due for their second dose – some of them are due since May. “Most people who haven't been vaccinated are either reluctant, anxious or procrastinating,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Many people who took vaccines over the last one week told TOI that they were forced to roll up their sleeves because of unavoidable reasons. “I am not averse to vaccination. I just didn’t think it was required,” said a senior citizen S Rajeshwari, who took the vaccine at a primary health center in Chennai on Thursday. For months, she and her husband were not willing to take the vaccine, until her son insisted. “He works for a corporate company. His office has made it mandatory for members of the house to get vaccinated. If we don’t take it, he will not be able to go back to work,” she said. People had different ways to reach the vaccination centers on Saturday, but most of them said they made the decision abruptly, after months of inaction. “I got sick of wearing the mask all day at college. I wear them even when I step out with friends for coffee. They keep reminding me to wear it properly as I am not vaccinated. I came here today because I am sick of it,” said a 19-year-old college student, Sakshi A. Vellore-based senior virologist Dr T Jacob John said many people should be encouraged to take this path quickly. “Fresh cases are down; hospitals are empty and there are no longer stringent lockdowns. So, people are probably assuming we are safe,” he said. “Vaccines can stop the new surge. We must get all our vulnerable people covered,” he said. 11 districts report increase in Covid cases:Eleven districts reported an increase in cases on Saturday when the fresh cases in the state dropped to 1,021 from 1,039 on Friday.

But the phrase was already growing in right-wing circles, and now the seemingly upbeat sentiment — actually a stand-in for swearing at Joe Biden — is everywhere. Republican Jeff Duncan, wore a “Let’s Go Brandon” mask at the Capitol last week. Texas Senator Ted Cruz posed with a “Let’s Go Brandon” sign. The line has become conservative code for something vulgar: “F*** Joe Biden.” It’s all the rage among Republicans wanting to prove their conservative credentials, a not-so-secret handshake that signals they’re in sync with the party’s base. It started at an October 2 Nascar race at in Alabama. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won a race and was being interviewed by an NBC reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something at first difficult to make out. The reporter suggested they were chanting “Let’s go, Brandon” to cheer the driver. But it became increasingly clear they were saying: “F*** Joe Biden.” Nascar and NBC have since taken steps to limit “ambient crowd noise” during interviews, but it was too late — the phrase already had taken off. America’s presidents have endured meanness for centuries; Andrew Jackson were the subject of poems that leaned into racist tropes and allegations of bigamy. “F*** Trump” graffiti still marks many an overpass in Washington, DC. George W Bush had a shoe thrown in his face. Even the racism and vitriol to which former President Barack Obama was subjected was tempered. A portion of the US was already angry before the Brandon moment, believing the 2020 presidential election was rigged, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. But now it’s more than that to diehard Trump supporters, said Stanley Renshon, a political scientist at the City University of New York. He cited the Afghanistan withdrawal and the rancorous school board debates over mask and vaccine mandates as situations in which Biden critics feel that “how US institutions are telling the American public what they clearly see and understand to be true, is in fact not true.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-lets-go-brandon-became-code-for-insulting-biden/articleshow/87414628.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Revamp with cycle tracks, parking on cards for link road to Atul Kataria Chowk||GURUGRAM: The 7.5km stretch of road linking Atul Kataria Chowk and Rezang La Chowk via the Sector 5 junction may soon undergo a transformation, with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) planning to develop it as a ‘model road’. According to GMDA officials, the entire stretch will be strengthened and upgraded as part of the project and several facilities will also be created for pedestrians and cyclists. Apart from walkways and cycle tracks, parking areas, rest areas, bus shelters, and “any other user facilities as per requirement” will be developed, an official said. The project will also include designing of a drainage system for the stretch, along with disposal points for stormwater and rain from surrounding areas. GMDA will also ensure sufficient illumination for the road. In addition, traffic safety features and ‘road furniture’ will also be installed along the stretch, including traffic signals, traffic signs, road markings, overhead signboards, crash barriers and delineators. “At present, we have floated a tender seeking consultancy services to prepare the feasibility report and detailed project report for the project. It will take around six months to prepare these documents alone, so work on the ground is unlikely to begin before the second half of next year,” GMDA traffic engineer (mobility division) J S Sindhu said. “The cost and details on how much time it will take to complete the work are not clear right now. We will only know these after the DPR is prepared and we have a clearer idea of the exact work that needs to be undertaken,” he added. The stretch sees thousands of commuters using it everyday, providing access to areas that have a high footfall, such as Sheetla Mata Mandir, Ashok Vihar, Sector 5 market, several hospitals, educational institutions and temples. The two junctions that will serve as the end points of the ‘model road’ are themselves amongst the busiest in the city. According to GMDA’s comprehensive mobility plan which was released in December last year, over 46,000 vehicles travel through the Atul Kataria Chowk and more than 14,000 vehicles through the Rezang La junction hourly on an average. The area near Sheetla Mata Mandir, which is located along the stretch as well, also has a very high volume of pedestrian movement, with over 150 pedestrians walking across the road and over 1,300 walking along it every hour during peak hours, the report reveals. “Both Atul Kataria Chowk and Rezang La Chowk are critical junctions in Gurgaon, providing access to the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway, Old Delhi-Gurgaon road and the Najafgarh-Kapashera road. The stretch where GMDA seems to be planning this model road also connects the areas to popular parts of Old Gurgaon, making it all the more important. Making this stretch a model road is a great idea. I hope that this actually becomes a reality as well, instead of just remaining on paper like many other plans in Gurgaon," said Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Sector 3.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/revamp-with-cycle-tracks-parking-on-cards-for-link-road-to-atul-kataria-chk/articleshow/87410197.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Officials said the GMDA has started fencing the green belt to prevent it from being overrun by squatters again. “These structures have been encroaching upon the green belt for around 10 years. The area was recently handed over to the GMDA. Previously, it was under the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), which had tried to clear the encroachments multiple times but had little success. On the directions of the GMDA CEO Sudhir Rajpal, we have today (Saturday) succeeded in clearing the squatters,” a senior GMDA official said, adding though heavy police force was deployed “the entire drive was completed peacefully”. The green belt, the official said, is located on a road that sees traffic movement from Gurgaon towards Delhi. “Barring a small, temporary temple set up by some people in the area all encroachments have been cleared. The people requested us to give them some time to remove their idol from the premises. We have granted them time after taking written assurance,” the official added. GMDA officials told TOI that they have initiated fencing work around the green belt and it was likely to take around two weeks to complete the work. “Clearing encroachments from this particular patch of the green belt had been pending for a very long time. We will continue to take similar action in green belts across the city to ensure there are no violations,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/eateries-nurseries-encroaching-green-belt-near-dronacharya-metro-removed/articleshow/87410277.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council president Cardinal Mar George Alencherry said that on behalf of the Kerala Catholic Church he wholeheartedly congratulates and appreciates Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his historic invitation to the Pope. “Narendra Modi, the honourable Prime Minister of India, has made a noble and laudable gesture in inviting His Holiness Pope Francis to visit our motherland, India. This decision will, of course, be applauded by all Indians irrespective of caste and faith. The people of India look towards the Roman Pontiff as an advocate and bold spokesperson of morality and humanitarian values,” said a statement issued by KCBC spokesperson Fr Jacob G Palackappilly. “It (the visit) will also smoothen the path of dialogue between Christianity and other religious groups of this nation. The papal visit will also promote fraternity and co-operation among the polyphonic society of India. We… are eagerly waiting for the blessed moments of the visit …,” the statement said. Major archbishop of Syro-Malankara Catholic Church Cardinal Baselios Cleemis welcomed the PM’s meeting with the Pope. He said that it is a historic visit and the invitation extended by the prime minister to Pope Francis to visit India is commendable. Archbishop of Verapoly Joseph Kalathiparambil said that the efforts of the Pope for world peace, social unity and the protection of the environment was a model to the world. The invitation by the prime minister would evoke happiness not just among Catholics but the public in general. “I pray that the visit happens as soon as possible,” said the archbishop. Catholicos of the Jacobite Church, Baselios Thomas I said that the meeting between PM Modi and Pope Francis was a ray of hope amid a global crisis. “At a time when the Covid crisis, natural calamities and religious clashes are rising, the meeting between the prime minister of the world’s largest democracy and the Pope who stands for humanity and peace gives hope to the world. May the India visit of the Pope occur as soon as possible and through it may the people of India be able to continue the path of spirituality and unity,” the catholicos said. Former bishop of Kanjirappally Mar Mathew Arackal termed Modi’s visit to the Vatican “historic” and “a matter of great joy”. The one-hour talk held by Modi with the Pope will lift the image of the country among the world nations and will also add sheen to secularism in the country, he said. “This is a moment of honour and great joy for the Christians who are a minority in the country. The meeting will make the relations between the Catholic church in the country and the central government warmer,” he said.

---||Bhopal||Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Kamal Nath cross swords amid low turnout in Madhya Pradesh bypolls||BHOPAL: A low turnout in the Madhya Pradesh bypolls was more than offset by a high voltage skirmish between BJP and Congress over the election in Prithvipur, an assembly seat on the border with Uttar Pradesh, which is warming up fir assembly polls. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan accused Congress of “unethical practices and violence” in the hotly contested seat, leading PCC chief Kamal Nath to remark that BJP has “accepted defeat”. Prithvipur in Tikamgarh district was among three assembly seats, Jobat (Alirajpur) and Raigaon (Satna) being the other two, that went to the polls, along with Khandwa Lok Sabha constituency on Saturday. Polling was still on when CM Chouhan accused Congress of intimidation and threats to get votes in Prithvipur. “Congress is flustered by its defeat in the bypolls. Even before polling, they used unethical means, distributed money and resorted to hooliganism and bullying. They are threatening people, especially in Prithvipur, where people are being manhandled,” the CM alleged in a video message on Saturday afternoon. Prithvipur has been a sensitive constituency for BJP since the 2008 assembly elections when the party’s candidate Sunik Naik was shot dead soon after voting was over. Prithvipur and Jobat were held by Congress and Raigaon and Khandwa LS by BJP. In Saturday’s bypoll, despite the high-decibel battle in Prithvipur, voting dipped — from 79.6% in 2018 to 78.1%. Raigaon saw a sharp dip, from 74.5% voter in 2018 to 69% this time. Only Jobat assembly constituency saw a small rise, from 52.8% to 53.3%. Khandwa saw the biggest drop in polling, from 76.9% in the 2019 Lok Sabha election to 63.8% — a fall of over 13%. Cumulatively, around 17 lakh of the 26.5 lakh voters exercised their franchise in the four seats. Khandwa and Raigaon had the highest number of candidates, 16, with 10 in Prithvipur and 6 in Jobat. Office of the chief electoral officer said the by-elections were peaceful. During mock polling, 71 ballot units, 31 control units and 76 VVPAT units had to be changed. And during actual voting, 20 ballot units, 12 control units and 44 VVPAT units were replaced. Counting of votes will begin at 8am on November 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/chief-minister-shivraj-singh-chouhan-kamal-nath-cross-swords-amid-low-turnout-in-madhya-pradesh-bypolls/articleshow/87414902.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Tikri protest site: 5feet-wide passage for pedestrians, two-wheelers from 7am to 8pm||ROHTAK/BATHINDA: Paving the way for clearing a 5-footwide passage for movement of pedestrians and two wheelers across Delhi’s Tikri border from 7am to 8pm, the farmer outfits and the Jhajjar administration reached an agreement on Saturday morning over removal of the barricades following a night of tension. This will make it an easier commute for labourers working in factories near Tikri border and in Bahadurgarh, as they had to take alternative routes during the past 11 months after the barricades were erected by Delhi Police. However, no three-wheeler or heavy traffic will be allowed to cross over. The autos will stop either on the Delhi side or the Bahadurgarh side and the passengers will cross the border on foot. The ambulances will be allowed to pass in case of any emergency. The passage will remain closed at night. The partial opening the road at Tikri border was the result of a joint meeting between Delhi & Haryana officials with farmers on Friday and Saturday. The process of removing the barriers began when the Supreme Court issued an order on October 21 ordering the unblocking of routes that had been closed to commuters due to anti-farm laws rallies at Delhi’s border ports of Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur. The Delhi police had started removing cement blocks, nails from their side to clear the passage of the road connecting Haryana and Delhi via Tikri-Bahadurgarh. The agreement was arrived at after some unpleasant scenes and tension at Tikri border on Friday night over the administration's bid to remove the barricades. “Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders had a meeting with police officials on Saturday morning where the mutual decision was taken . "It has been decided that a 5-foot-wide passage will be left for twowheelers or ambulances at the Tikri border. The passage is being allowed keeping in mind the problems being faced by labourers working in factories and those using twowheelers or going on foot for their daily needs,” farm outfit BKU Ekta Dakaunda president Buta Singh Burjgill told TOI. The SKM also made it plain that a collective decision will be taken at an appropriate time on whether the farmer agitation continues at the same site or moves into Delhi. SKM pointed out that in case the government wants to open the passage completely, it has to open the passage to fulfill the farmers' demands. Burjgill said that as per the earlier agreement the way was to be opened today (Saturday) in the presence of farm leaders, but the police started removing barricades on Friday night by pressing a JCB into service. "We reached there and objected, but the police paid no heed, until we lay down on the ground and asked the police to run the JCB over us," he added. Heavy traffic could not be allowed as the farmers are living nearby in tents and keep moving in the area. An accident could occur if heavy flow of traffic is allowed like the case of the three women who were crushed to death three days ago, said Buta Singh and Balkaran Singh. Plan for protest at Glasgow during Modi visit SKM said that supporters of the farm movement in the UK are getting ready to protest when Prime Minister Narendra Modi reaches Glasgow to take part in the United Nations' COP26 on climate. The protest in Glasgow is to let the Modi government know that its undemocratic, unresponsive and obstinate behaviour is being condemned elsewhere too. SKM further stated that it is learnt that the US-based farmer movement supporter Darshan Singh Dhaliwal, was reportedly asked not to support the langars at the morcha site if he was to be allowed entry into India, and it was for this reason that he was deported from India. It urged the authorities to desist from harassing supporters of the farmers' movement. Jind farmer dies of cardiac arrestA 62-year-old farmer, who had died due to cardiac arrest at Tikri border on Friday, was cremated in Jind district, reports Vijender Kumar. The deceased has been identified as Karan Singh of Shahpur village of Haryana’s Jind district. He is survived by two sons. The deceased was bringing milk from their fellow farmers at another protesting site when he complained of chest pain and sat down on the ground. His fellow farmers rubbed his legs and chest, but it was futile.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/tikri-protest-site-5feet-wide-passage-for-pedestrians-two-wheelers-from-7am-to-8pm/articleshow/87414739.cms||Sat Singh
---||Noida||Greater Noida: Aide for 20 years joins hands with rival to shoot gangster||GREATER NOIDA: A gangster with several cases of murder, extortion, robbery and attempt to murder lodged against him in Noida and Delhi, was allegedly shot dead over profit sharing in property business by his long-time aide and two others in Greater Noida. The prime accused in the case has been arrested, police said. Manjeet Nagar, who entered the crime world in 2014 to avenge his brother Sujeet’s murder over a property dispute about 21 years ago, was, in fact, found dead in his Scorpio along the 130-metre road of the city late on Friday night with five gunshot wounds in his head, waist, arm and chest. Police said that Manjeet was gunned down by Yashpal, his aide of 20 years. Both were friends and property business partners. However, over the past few months, they had gotten distanced as “Manjeet was not giving Yashpal his share in the latest property deals”, cops said. Originally from Dhoomkheda village, Manjeet had been staying with his second wife and a child in Antriksh Gold View 2 society in Sector 78, while his first wife and two children with her stayed in their native place. He was involved in the illegal purchase and sale of properties in Greater Noida. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander told TOI that Manjeet had of late been earning a lot from his property business. “But recently he had stopped paying Yashpal his share in the latest deals. In a recent land deal clinched by Manjeet, the latter had not paid about Rs 5-6 lakh to Yashpal,” he said. This, however, did not go down well with Yashpal, a retired Army personnel who had already been harbouring a deep resentment against Manjeet. Yashpal soon roped in Sanjay, an arch rival of Manjeet, to eliminate his long-time friend. On Friday night, police said, Yashpal got Manjeet drunk in his vehicle and then called up Sanjay, who arrived at the spot with an accomplice, and gunned the gangster down. “Sanjay was once a friend of Manjeet, who was hired by the latter to eliminate his brother’s killers. However, after Sanjay orchestrated the murder, Manjeet did not pay to him the entire amount he had promised to. This infuriated Sanjay and he had been harbouring resentment ever since,” Bisrakh station house officer (SHO) Anita Chauhan said. Manjeet first got his brother's murderer Popan Bhati killed in June 2014. Since then, Manjeet’s involvement was seen in several cases pertaining to extortion, Arms Act and attempt to murder. The slain gangster was also accused of joining hands with sharp shooters from the Anil Dujana, Heavy Darbaripur and Ravi Rupawas gangs for allegedly plotting the murder of a real estate magnate based in Greater Noida, which was foiled by Delhi Police. “Yashpal’s pistol is currently with Sanjay as informed by him. The remaining three arms have been recovered from Yashpal. Since Yashpal was retired from the Indian Army, he has four licenced pistols,” the DCP said. Cops are, however, verifying how Yashpal could get four licensed weapons. An FIR has been lodged in the case under Section 302 against Yashpal, Sanjay and their accomplice. While Yashpal has been arrested, the two others are on the run.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/aide-for-20-years-joins-hands-with-rival-to-shoot-gangster/articleshow/87410288.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Noida: Winter knocks on the door, birds arrive||NOIDA: With winter knocking on the door, the Okhla Bird Sanctuary in Noida has started welcoming its seasonal visitors. It is still early for large-scale winter migration, officials said, but some early visitors have arrived near the major water bodies in the district, including Okhla, Surajpur and Dhanauri wetlands. Over 1,000 early migratory birds have arrived at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, according to officials. Bird-watchers can now spot painted storks, different varieties of gulls, cormorants, greater flamingoes and northern shovellers, among the aquatic species. Terrestrial birds such as Eurasian hobbies can also be seen, along with the domestic species. “Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Surajpur, Dhanauri and NTPC areas are getting early migrants. We are hoping that in the next 15-20 days, the water bodies will be full of several bird species,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. The Okhla Bird Sanctuary is open to the public from 7.30am to 5pm, every day. Every year, the sanctuary sees about 200 species of birds in large flocks. At least, 15,000-20,000 birds visit the area, annually. “The migration has just started, but we are expecting higher numbers, this year. Once the birds start coming in large flocks, the entire water body will be covered by birds,” said Arvind Mishra, range officer, Okhla Bird Sanctuary. He added that this year, people could avail park facilities such as golf cart tours, a canteen, and a new bamboo bridge to reach the watchtower. The nature camp, another addition, will be ready in the next 15 days. The forest department had also proposed cottages for night stays. However, the plan was shelved after birders argued that tourists at night would adversely impact bird migration. The park was thrown open to the public from the beginning of October, following the post-monsoon clean-up and habitat development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/winter-knocks-on-the-door-birds-arrive/articleshow/87410351.cms||Snehil Sinha

The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest) of the UT administration has written to the civic body to identify the locations for both fast and slow charging stations. The financial mode of the venture is not known yet. It is also not clear whether the municipal corporation (MC) will make some revenue out of it. Sources said no financial model is mentioned by the Crest so far. A total of 600 square feet parking area is required for a fast charging station and 1,000 square feet for a slow charging station inclusive of area required for equipment like transformers, according to information given by the UT administration to the MC. ‘Firm will tell space for EV charging station’The UT also told the MC that it has received requests from two companies who had got the charging stations allocated from the department of heavy industries. “Since the UT has asked to provide space for the charging station, the company will tell us the exact locations and we will provide the space accordingly.

Subsequently, PSPCL has issued termination notice to the company. The PSPCL is, however, tightlipped over the PPAs with the other two Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Punjab — NPL Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL). The move assumes political significance as affordable power by cancelling the PPAs with private players had figured on the 18-point agenda of AICC and the Channi-led government had promised to take steps to, bring down power tariff. In July, then CM Amarinder Singh had directed PSPCL to revoke its PPA with TSPL, Mansa, as it had “miserably failed to perform” during the current paddy season. He had said that the PPA was “heavily biased in favour of the company.” PPA decision to safeguard interest of consumers, says CM Channi Meanwhile, a preliminary default notice has been served by PSPCL to GVK on Saturday for cancellation of PPA due to high power cost and falling lowest in the merit order, procurement of energy from GVK that had been restricted only within the range of 25-30% during most times of the year resulting in higher tariff of about Rs 7.52 per unit for last year. Channi said this step had been taken to safeguard the interest of consumers by reducing the burden of costly power. An official spokesperson said that the basic premise of entering into PPA by GVK with PSPCL was to provide cheaper power to PSPCL. GVK had been generating energy by arranging coal from Coal India Limited under SHAKTI Policy. As per the PPA, GVK was required to arrange a captive coal mine but it failed to do so, even after the lapse of more than 5 years of synchronization with the grid, he added. The capacity charges are being decided by Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) based on a capital cost of around Rs 3,058crore, which is equivalent to about Rs 1.61 per unit of fixed cost. The spokesperson mentioned that GVK had moved to Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) for claiming higher fixed cost to the tune of Rs 2.50 per unit based on claims of capital cost of about Rs 4,400 crore which is pending adjudication. Moreover, the GVK had defaulted for not clearing dues accrued to it timely, against the loans taken by it from various lenders. Lenders have approached National Company Law Tribunals (NCLT) for a resolution plan for GVK which is under consideration before the Tribunal, the spokesperson claimed. It was in Augustend this year when the state government, on the recommendation of a three-member committee of PSPCL, had decided to serve default notices to other two IPPs in the state. The official spokesperson at both the plants confirmed they haven’t received any notices in this regard. The committee had then submitted before the Punjab government that about 5737 MUs of energy has been surrendered while fixed charges of about Rs 1017 crores have been paid by the PSPCL to GVK for such energy for the financial year 2018-19 till 2020-21. The committed claimed that the cost of surrendered power from this plant was Rs 142 crores, Rs 610 crores, and Rs 265 crores during 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, respectively, whereas the average per unit charges (fixed + variable) of GVK remained at Rs 6.63, Rs, 10.02 and Rs 7.53, respectively. Sources revealed that Punjab CM had recently held meetings with the senior officials in the power sector and the PSPCL to discuss the PPAs with the IPPs and has been planning to renegotiate the power pacts with NPL whereas the other IPP could be served notice for revised terms and conditions. While chairman cum managing director PSPCL A.Venu Parsad could not be contacted for comments, PSPCL director generation Paramjeet Singh feigned ignorance about any action plant being taken for renegotiation and notices and said, “I am unaware about this if any notices were being sent in this regard” Sources revealed that the white paper on PPAs has been almost prepared and will be submitted to the government with responsibilities and accountability fixed on those responsible for the costlier PPAs with the IPPs in Punjab.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/after-punjab-cm-charanjit-singh-channi-nod-pspcl-notice-to-scrap-gvk-power-purchase-agreement/articleshow/87415022.cms||---

Launch after that?||NOIDA: With civil work complete at the Sector 71 underpass, the technical committee of the Noida Authority will inspect the project on Monday before giving the final go-ahead for its launch. However, the inauguration of the underpass may take a few more days as the Authority is waiting for industrial development minister Satish Mahana’s visit to the city to officially throw it open for the traffic. “The technical committee of the Authority that has been constituted to review the progress and construction quality of big-ticket infrastructure projects in the city will inspect the underpass on Monday. Once it gives the green signal, the underpass will be officially ready for use,” a senior Authority official told TOI. Officials are, in fact, mulling to initially open one carriageway of the underpass to facilitate movement of commuters towards Parthala Chowk from Noida City Centre. To divert the traffic around the sectors 52 and 71 crossing while the underpass was being constructed, the Authority had removed a portion of the road median, which has to be built again. “Motorists are plying via the breached median. Till the median is built again, the second carriageway cannot be opened for vehicles,” the official added. Also motorists who take a left turn from the Vishwakarma Marg to head towards Noida City Centre from 7X sectors are facing a bottleneck under the Sector 52 metro station. Apart from crowding and haphazard parking of auto-rickshaws near the metro station, a pillar of the foot overbridge constructed at the metro station is blocking the vehicles. As a long-term solution, the Authority has sought the permission of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to shift the pillar. Authority officials will create a gap in the retaining wall of the underpass in order to shift the pillar from its existing location and facilitate the movement of the traffic in a seamless manner. Officials said that the underpass inspection team will also see the condition of the two sumpwells built to drain out water during the monsoon. Meanwhile, commuters said that the underpass should be thrown open for the traffic as soon as it gets ready. “What is the point of waiting for a minister if the project is ready. It can be thrown open for commuters. We have already waited for more than two years. A symbolic inauguration ceremony can be held later if it is so important for officials,” said Ishant Jain, a resident of Sector 74.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/tech-team-will-inspect-sector-71-underpass-launch-after-that/articleshow/87410386.cms||---

One of his friends has been arrested while six others have been booked on charges of murder, police said, adding that all the accused are also Somalian nationals. According to police officers, victim Mohamed Mohamud Duale and his friends were staying in India as refugees and held United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cards. On October 27 night, the victim had accompanied his friends, who had come from Delhi’s Malviya Nagar area, to a party at a hotel in Sector 45. The men later went to Duale’s residence in Mayfield Garden in Sector 50, police said. “All the men were inebriated. But on reaching his residence, Duale insisted on having more alcohol that led to a heated argument following which one of the friends pushed him against a wall. As everyone was inebriated, it appears they did not realise the extent of Duale’s injury at that time,” a police officer from Sector 50 police station said. The friends claimed that they had gone off to sleep after the incident. On Thursday morning, when Duale didn’t respond, they rushed him to the hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. After a complaint was registered by Duale’s cousin at Sector 50 police station, an FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of IPC against the seven friends on Friday, while one of them was arrested later. “We have arrested one of the seven men. Till now, only his involvement has come to the fore. We are looking into the matter and investigating the others too,” the officer said. Deepak Mathur, a forensic expert who conducted the autopsy, said, “Going by the preliminary reports, it appears that the person (Duale) died due to a head injury from a blunt object leading to internal bleeding in the brain.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/somali-man-dies-after-brawl-1-held-6-booked/articleshow/87410657.cms||---

She has filed the complaint with the Peroorkada police station. “What the minister did was character assassination. It is my right to choose with whom I should live,” said Anupama in her complaint given to the police. Cherian had flayed Anupama and her husband Ajith for the adoption row. “Her parents have done only what everyone will do in the society,” the minister said while speaking at a function on Friday in Thiruvananthapuram. Even though he did not mention the name of Anupama or her father, the minister said the parents cannot be blamed for this. He also made a remark on the relationship Anupama is having with Ajith who already had a relationship with another woman. “We are not against the opinion that the child should be brought back to its mother. But for that it should not be said that her parents should go to jail. The emotions of her parents should be understood. We all have girl children,” said the minister. The parents have lot of dreams about their children. But when the girl child falls into love with a person who already have children in another marriage and gives birth to a child from that person, what the parents will do, he asked. “After marriage, two or three children are born, then fall in love with the wife of a friend and after that fall in love with another young girl and a child is born in that relation. When the parents question this, they are asked to go to jail,” the minister said. The CPM district secretary Anavoor Nagappan also came out strongly on the adoption row. “The media did not bother to find out the reality behind this controversy because she belongs to a CPM family. It has to be understood that Ajith had fallen in love with Anupama even before ending his relationship with the legal wife. He was forced to end this relation after the birth of a child from Anupama. Now nobody is thinking about how the first wife of Ajith will live,” he said in a social media post. Marry a woman after forcing her out of a relationship and same time fall in love with another and make her pregnant. Is this acceptable to our society, he asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/kerala-minister-saji-cherians-tasteless-jibe-anupama-s-chandran-files-defamation-case/articleshow/87415057.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab reports 50 Covid-dengue cases||CHANDIGARH: Amid the ongoing pandemic, around 50 cases of Covid-19 and dengue co-infection have been reported in Punjab — cases where patients have tested positive for both Covid and dengue. Some co-infected patients have dominant dengue (an illness caused by dengue viruses), while Covid — a respiratory illness caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 — is the dominant co-infection in others.  As the majority of cases of Covid are asymptomatic, health experts have warned that in a setting of co-infection, the combination might enhance the severity of both the diseases.  The outbreak of dengue during the ongoing pandemic has increased the pressure on doctors, as it is not easy to distinguish symptoms because of the overlapping clinical presentations of both the diseases. “Timely diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to avoid devastating complications of severe forms of co-infection,” said Dr Gupta, who also laid emphasis on reconfirming the dengue serology in Covid-infected. Dr Gupta also called for a need to develop an accurate point of care testing for prevention from both diseases. Punjab has reported an unprecedented number of cases of dengue cases this year. The state has already surpassed the previous highest of 15,398 dengue cases recorded in 2017 by registering 16,129 cases. Besides, 61 suspected deaths have been reported till October 30. From 2018 to 2020, the state had witnessed a steady decline in dengue cases. Mohali tops the list with 2,531 cases, followed by 2,114 people testing positive for dengue in Bathinda, 1,504 in Hoshiarpur, 1,489 in Amritsar, 1,479 in Pathankot, 1,242 in Muktsar and 1,198 in Ludhiana. Dr Gagandeep Grover, Punjab nodal officer for vector-borne diseases, attributed the surge in case to increase in testing, prolonged monsoon and lack of public participation. Against 18,000 tests conducted last year, the health department has collected and examined 40,680 samples so far this year. Dr Grover said during inspections conducted by different teams, scollection of water was spotted in a majority of homes, which became a perfect breeding place for mosquitoes. “The government is making every possible effort and the public needs to reciprocate by taking all precautions and keeping the surroundings clean,” said Dr Grover. Covid beds for degnue patientsAs the steep rise in dengue cases putting a pressure on health infrastructure, the health department has authorised government hospitals to use beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the bed occupancy for Covid had dropped significantly. He said beds reserved for Covid could be used for treating dengue patients whenever required. The health department data stated 9,357 oxygen beds out of 9,565 were vacant as of 5pm on October 30, while 1,541 of 1,596 ICU beds were unoccupied .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-reports-50-covid-dengue-cases/articleshow/87414860.cms||Vinod Kumar

The reason for the apparent suicide of monk Vimad Sagar isn't known and no note has been found, say police. He had come to the temple around three days ago. From what investigators have found so far, Sagar went into his room, where he meditates and prays, around 1.30pm, asking one of his disciples to go out for Vihar in the evening, said Pardeshipura police station in-charge Pankaj Dwivedi. Devotees gathered outside Jain temple in Nanda Nagar on Saturday"The disciple went to his room around 5pm and knocked at the door, but got no response. He thought that monk was probably meditating, so he went away," said Dwivedi. Half an hour later, he again knocked at the door. "This time, too, he got no response, so he decided to check on him. He looked into the room through a window and was shocked to see monk Sagar hanging," said Dwivedi. He alerted others. They informed police and forced open the door. A police team, along with forensic experts, inspected the room. "It is a clear-cut case of suicide," said Dwivedi, adding that the body was sent for post-mortem to MY Hospital after four hours as the followers gathered and demanded there shouldn't be any autopsy. Pradeep Badjatya, a devotee of the monk, said, "Acharya Vimad Sagar was suffering from piles and it might have led him to be depressed." Monk Vimad Sagar was a native of MP's Sagar, and had taken Diksha at the age of 15. He was a disciple of Acharya Virat Sagar. "He had come to Indore for Chaturmas in Gumasta Nagar area. Before that he stopped at the Jain temple for Dharm Prabhavna," said Badjatya, who had performed Nagar Pravesh for the Acharya on his arrival in Indore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/jain-monk-found-hanging-in-indore-temple/articleshow/87415085.cms||---

More than 7 crore doses have been given. MP has vaccinated 92% of its target population with the first dose and 37% with the second dose,” the CM said. However, more needs to be done, he cautioned. “Now, children should motivate parents to take the vaccine. All the students should take up this responsibility and work to create the environment for vaccination,” the CM said on Saturday at an event to mark 7 crore doses. “This is just a stop. Our destination is complete vaccination,” he reminded people of the state. “Let us leave no stone unturned to vaccinate those who have not yet been vaccinated. It’s a challenge. We should not take a sigh of relief until the goal is achieved,” he urged. “If everyone gets fully vaccinated by December 31, we can be free from the third wave fear,” he pointed out. At least 5 to 6 lakh doses must be administered daily and there should be no let-up in vaccination even during festivals, the CM ordered. He suggested that people could form motivational groups to encourage people to take the life-saving shots. “There are Covid guidelines to be followed during festivals. Avoid infection by taking the necessary precautions,” Chouhan said. No appreciation is enough for the vaccination teams — from doctors and nurses to anganwadi workers, data managers, and cold chain handlers, he said. “Health workers crossed rivers to do their job. Those who do excellent work at district level should be honoured and encouraged,” the CM said, mentioning hard work of Alirajpur ANM Reena Rai, who has been praised by PM Modi too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/tell-parents-to-get-vaccinated-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-tells-students/articleshow/87415178.cms||---
