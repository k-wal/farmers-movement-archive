He’s sounding happy, and enthusiastic about the task on hand, ahead of another challenging Indian Super League (ISL) season. The Durand Cup victory has clearly sparked a change. Excerpts from an interview with the FC Goa coach. What does the Durand Cup triumph mean to you and the team?This was part of our pre-season. We wanted to check young players like (Muhammed) Nemil, Christy (Davis), Danstan (Fernandes), Delton (Colaco), who could possibly help the first team. The experience was good. The foreign players decided to come early and work with the team, so there were plenty of positives. Even on the field, the semifinal and final, where we played 120 minutes, were a good test. It’s good to win a trophy; good for the club and mentality of the players. Pre-season is normally four to six weeks, but Goa started training in August itself. What was the thinking behind an early start?A normal pre-season is one month, maximum six weeks. But this is when you are the head coach of Chelsea, Manchester United, Barcelona, and now, Newcastle (United). The truth is when I had my first meetings with (club president) Akshay (Tandon) and (director of football) Ravi (Puskur), they told me it was very important to help improve the players too. It’s not possible to do this within a month. You need time, lot of practice, lot of patience. Given a choice, I would have started pre-season in July. Our target is not just to win games, but also develop players. Last year you played two foreign defenders. With only four foreign players to be used this season, is that an area of concern?It’s not just the centre-backs that I am thinking about. I think about the team. I played Papuia (in the Durand Cup), not because he is better than Aibanbha (Dohling) but because of the overall balance of the team. I know Papuia is more confident in build-ups, in the timing of the pass and that’s good for us. Aibanbha is more aggressive in defence, particularly with the second balls. My job is to make all my players ready. Maybe we can play both, or (Mohammed) Ali when he is ready. I can play Ivan-Papuia or (Dylan) Fox-Ivan (Gonzalez), depending on the opponents. There are options. Does reduction in foreign players complicate things?When I prepare the lineup, I never look at names. I never check who is a foreign player or Indian. For me, everyone is a member of the team. Foreigners don’t have guaranteed spots. It’s true we can play only four foreign players and you know how difficult it was in the AFC Champions League (when Goa had to leave out two foreigners). I trust the Indian players. What is the injury status of Jorge Ortiz and Brandon Fernandes?I know they are upset (that they cannot train), and it’s a difficult situation. We continue to train and prepare (for the season). When they are ready, they'll help us, because they are fantastic players and great persons. What are your first impressions of Airam Cabrera, a new foreign player who will have a significant role to play this season?I am happy. I can see that he completely understands his role in the team. I like when I see that he is talking with the local players, relaying his experience and helps in training sessions. The others like Alberto (Noguera), Edu (Bedia), Ivan, Fox, Jorge, who are here are willing to help others improve. This is the way forward for FC Goa. Is this team stronger than last season?Every season is different. Maybe you have the best squad, but don't have success; sometimes your squad is not the strongest in ISL and you have success. For a team to be successful, emotions in the dressing room are very important. When the feelings are good, your performance will be better. My squad will improve step-by-step, game-by-game. We will be strongest towards the last part of the league. You could see last season that we played our best in the AFC Champions League and it was a big difference from our game against Bengaluru FC (in the ISL opener). What are the goals that you have set for the season? Last year the aim was to make it to the top four. Are the goals a bit higher now, given you have had time with the team?If you ask me personally, of course, my aim is to win the ISL, but I don’t like to put pressure (on the players). I prepare my team match-by-match. First up is Mumbai (City), then Jamshedpur. Is it an advantage that four of the six foreign players are the same from last season?Yes, because now the players know about my methodology, they know me, about my role in the dressing room. They know what i expect during games. There is a good connection after one season. The relationship with a team is like a girlfriend. You take it step-by-step. If the relationship is good, maybe it’s for life. When you joined Goa, only Brandon was a national team player. Now there is Seriton Fernandes, Glan Martins, Dheeraj Singh and Princeton Rebello. Does the individual progress of players make you happy?I am happy for the players. They work so hard and their place in the national team is a result of that. I want to see players like (Saviour) Gama, Devendra (Murgaonkar), Sanson (Pereira), move to the national team. There are others too. They are never sad in training. They are always ready to do whatever is told. They never grumble, whether it’s rain or shine. Goa have an unbeaten record of 15 matches going into this season. Does that mean anything?My target is to change the draws into wins. I understand it’s difficult because there are lot of teams with good squads, good coaches. The ambience in our dressing room is good. That’s the key for us.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hope-to-convert-draws-into-wins-from-fc-goas-record-unbeaten-run-and-win-isl-trophy-juan-ferrando/articleshow/87378552.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Under the IGRUA-Drone Destination MoU, currently two drone pilot schools, in one Manesar and Bengaluru, are operational and several more are planned to open across the country. “Our aim is to ensure ‘udaye drone aam naagrik’ by having as many centres across the country as possible in the coming days. Prime Minister Modi has helped unleash the true potential of this technology in India through a new drone policy that was driven by him and made possible this new UDAN of 'udaye drone aam naagrik’. Drones need trained pilots, and we will train as many as possible through our schools and by tying up with both corporates and state government departments,” said Drone Destinations promoter Chirag Sharma. Haryana’s had recently constituted Drone Imaging and Information Service of Haryana Limited (DRIISHYA) for speedy implementation of various types of surveys and imaging work using drones as manual surveys take much longer. Drone surveys are expected to benefit several departments like revenue, mining, forest, traffic, disaster management and agriculture. (DRIISHYA) recently jointly signed an MoU with IGRUA and Drone Destination for training. IGRUA director Krishnendu Gupta had recently told TOI the academy is now diversifying beyond training commercial aircraft pilots to other areas in a bid to generate funds and become self-sufficient. "We issued an expression of interest to tie up for drone pilot training institutes. Drone Destination, which also manufactures drones, was chosen as they are experts in this field as we are in ours. We will open many more centres jointly in other cities, like Kolkata and Pune,” Gupta had said. IGRUA and Drone Destination currently operate out of two satellite campuses one in Manesar, Haryana, and the other in Bengaluru. “With the launch of the new drone policy, we envision to establish drone training schools with various State Governments across India,” Gupta had said. Drone Destination’s Chirag Sharma said more drone pilot training schools will come up in places like Mumbai, Chennai, Bhopal, Kolkata and Pune. “A large number of government programmes will be implemented using drones. The 'Swamitva' scheme -- where people in villages will be given title to their lands after mapping by drones -- will alone absorb 55,000 pilots. Using drones in agriculture for land surveys to determine soil health and pesticide spray will absorb an equal number. And these are just two examples,” Sharma said. Officials say a drone school can train about 300 pilots annually. “The cost for multi rotor drone training is Rs 55,000 (plus taxes) and the course is of six-day duration. Training for the bigger fixed wing drones and hybrid drones (vertical take off and landing) can cost upto Rs 1.25 lakh,” they say.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/igrua-drone-destination-to-train-common-man-to-fly-drones/articleshow/87378431.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Until a few months ago, not many knew of Patel, despite some stellar achievements. She won silver at the Asian Para Games in 2018, gold at Para Bangkok Open in 2019 and has been the undisputed champion in India, winning the national championships a record eight times. Yet, it took a silver medal at the Paralympics in Tokyo to make everyone sit up and take notice. “I can see a lot of changes after the Paralympics silver,” Patel told TOI during a media interaction in the city on Friday. “Earlier, who is Bhavina Patel was not known even to my neighbours, but now the world knows. Everyone in India knows, thanks to the media coverage. My life has changed.” Afflicted with polio as a toddler and using crutches ever since, Patel moved to Ahmedabad to pursue a computer science course. It was here that she was introduced to table tennis and it was love at first sight. “Initially, I started playing for fun, but then my interest kept growing. I had the confidence too and felt this game can give a new direction to my life. Whenever I play table tennis, I feel happy. I forget everything. Since my young days, I have had to face a lot of issues with disability. Table tennis helped me a lot,” said Patel, who is in Goa to attend the 18th anniversary celebrations of Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) in Porvorim on Saturday. Nothing has ever come easy for the 34-year-old. She had to change buses, hop into autorickshaws and then move on crutches to the table tennis venue. Anyone else would have given up the chase, but Patel’s motivation was so strong that she did not allow anything to come in her way. “People often see our disability and not our talent. They look at us as disabled, as if it was a mistake to have been born on earth. For the disabled, it’s a challenge every day. We have to fight, and it starts in the morning itself when you have to get out of bed,” said Patel. She has fought hard all her life. Nowhere was it more evident than in Tokyo where she upset some of the biggest names in para table tennis to win the Paralympics silver in women’s singles Class 4 event. In the semifinals when she was already assured of a bronze medal, she was up against Zhang Miao who she had not defeated in 11 previous meetings. Patel delivered when it mattered the most, putting it across the former world No 1 and current No 3 with a stunning display in five games. “My dream was always to win a medal at the Paralympics,” said Patel. “After I couldn’t make it to Rio 2016 (due to a technicality), there were question marks. I felt depressed too and didn’t know what to do, but my husband and family kept backing me.” Even when Patel qualified for Tokyo – her debut on such a big stage – she knew Paris 2024 was not too far away. Then the Covid-19 pandemic forced everyone indoors. “I trained the most during the pandemic. We set up a small table at home and trained. I feel great that after so many sacrifices, I could win a medal. It’s a proud feeling,” said Patel, who has now been recommended for the Arjuna Award, another dream come true.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/table-tennis-makes-me-forget-everything-life-has-not-been-the-same-since-paralympics-silver-bhavina-patel/articleshow/87378706.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||FDA paves way for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccinations in young kids||WASHINGTON: The Food and Drug Administration on Friday paved the way for children ages 5 to 11 to get Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine.The FDA cleared kid-size doses — just a third of the amount given to teens and adults — for emergency use, and up to 28 million more American children could be eligible for vaccinations as early as next week. One more regulatory hurdle remains: On Tuesday, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make more detailed recommendations on which youngsters should get vaccinated, with a final decision by the agency’s director expected shortly afterwards. “With this vaccine kids can go back to something that’s better than being locked at home on remote schooling, not being able to see their friends,” said Dr. Kawsar Talaat of Johns Hopkins University. “The vaccine will protect them and also protect our communities.” A few countries have begun using other Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12, including China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds. But many that use the vaccine made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are watching the U.S. decision, and European regulators just began considering the companies’ kid-size doses. With FDA’s action, Pfizer plans to begin shipping millions of vials of the pediatric vaccine — in orange caps to avoid mix-ups with the purple-capped doses for everyone else — to doctors’ offices, pharmacies and other vaccination sites. Kids will get two shots, three weeks apart. While children are at lower risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19 than older people, 5- to 11-year-olds still have been seriously affected -- including over 8,300 hospitalizations, about a third requiring intensive care, and nearly 100 deaths since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the FDA. And with the extra-contagious delta variant circulating, the government has counted more than 2,000 coronavirus-related school closings just since the start of the school year, affecting more than a million children. Earlier this week, FDA’s independent scientific advisers voted that the pediatric vaccine’s promised benefits outweigh any risks. But several panelists said not all youngsters will need to be vaccinated, and that they preferred the shots be targeted to those at higher risk from the virus. Nearly 70% of 5- to 11-year-olds hospitalized for Covid-19 in the US have other serious medical conditions, including asthma and obesity, according to federal tracking. Additionally, more than two-thirds of youngsters hospitalized are Black or Hispanic, mirroring long-standing disparities in the disease’s impact. The question of how broadly Pfizer’s vaccine should be used will be a key consideration for the CDC and its advisers, who set formal recommendations for pediatricians and other medical professionals. A Pfizer study of 2,268 schoolchildren found the vaccine was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, based on 16 cases of Covid-19 among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got vaccinated. The kid dosage also proved safe, with similar or fewer temporary reactions — such as sore arms, fever or achiness — that teens experience. But the study wasn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second full-strength dose, mostly in young men and teen boys. It’s unclear if younger children getting a smaller dose also will face that rare risk. Some parents are expected to vaccinate their children ahead of family holiday gatherings and the winter cold season. But a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey suggests most parents won’t rush to get the shots. About 25% of parents polled earlier this month said they would get their children vaccinated “right away.” But the remaining majority of parents were roughly split between those who said they will to wait to see how the vaccine performs and those who said they “definitely” won’t have their children vaccinated. The similarly made Moderna vaccine also is being studied in young children, and both Pfizer and Moderna also are testing shots for babies and preschoolers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fda-paves-way-for-pfizer-covid-19-vaccinations-in-young-kids/articleshow/87376257.cms||---

Halloween, which has been quite popular among Gurugrammers, is finally back this year but with COVID protocols. With scary costumes and face painting, condominiums are making sure that kids have a great time on the day but only after taking all safety measures. While some condos have assigned garden areas for trick-or-treat, others are working on costumes around masks to be creative as well as safe. With small gatherings and social distancing, adults in all condos where Halloween would be celebrated, will be ensuring that it is celebrated in a guarded manner. ‘Designated trick-or-treat areas to avoid overcrowding in lifts’Residents of condominiums are making sure that kids follow safety protocols while stepping out for Halloween. Arpana Agarwal, a resident of Pioneer Araya & Presidia, shares, “Kids will not be going to houses for trick-or-treat as it will get overcrowded in lifts. Around 100 kids are participating, so we have asked the parents who want to take part in trick-or-treat to come down to the garden area. We have set up stalls there, everything will take place in the open area to maintain social distancing.” Residents are ensuring that kids sanitise their hands frequentlySimilarly, in La Lagune, residents have made a WhatsApp group of families who are interested in letting kids visit their homes for trick-or-treat. “Our entire condo is aware of the COVID protocols because we went through a tough time in the second wave as a community. That is why we were avoiding organising any event where there would be a crowd of any kind. But the kids have not had any social interaction for a long time and they are usually excited about Halloween because they get to dress up and go for trick-or-treating. So, this was something we thought we could do, while following COVID protocols. We have a WhatsApp group where people who want to give out candies to kids have given their names so that kids also know which houses to visit. We are going to have kids of maximum two families go together for trick-or-treat. It’s a small thing as a community that we plan to celebrate,” says Sonia Sinha, a resident of La Lagune.

Kids and parents get creative with masks this HalloweenThere are other condominiums as well which have created a list of residents who wish to give out candies to kids and groups have been formed so that kids only visit their homes. “Kids know of such families and they plan to go for trick-or-treat there,” says Richa Kalra, a resident of Sector 52. Children will go trick-or-treating to only those houses that have signed up for itVandana Sharma, a resident of Pinnacle, adds, “Some of the kids are very keen on celebrating Halloween with gusto. We are trying to be more guarded and identifying people who are comfortable having kids visit them, making sure they are coached to wear masks and move around in their groups in a more guarded way than they did before.” She also points out that kids and parents are working together to get more creative with masks. “While some are planning to indulge in some face painting around coloured masks, others plan to wear face shields and will paint on the shield. There are a few who are going to wear superhero masks which double up as face coverings,” she says.

Akash kandeels, as the Mahrashtrians call it, are basically lanterns that will soon be seen adorning most households during the festive season. And while various types of kandeels made from paper, plastic and many other materials are already available all over the city right now, a few students have come together to create a sustainable version. In a bid to revive forgotten weaves and promote eco-friendly kandeels, some students of Sir JJ School of Art have been making cloth kandeels that have a shelf life of three years and can be reused multiple times. “We haven’t used anything artificial at all, nor any kind of plastic while making these kandeels. These are completely eco-friendly and sustainable,” says Utsavi Lahane, a student. The students say that they wanted to make something authentic. Utsavi shares, “We are using the traditional Maharashtrian Khann cloth to create these special kandeels. Though this textile apparently originated in Andhra Pradesh, where local men and women weave this cloth, it is highly auspicious in Maharashtra and is also offered to our goddesses. I wanted to bring back what we have lost — these little traditions and cultures. So, we have used this special textile.” This is the first time these students are making something like this professionally and they’re already inundated with orders. Siddhi Lahane, a student who’s also involved in making these Khann kandeels, feels that this entire process — right from ideating to getting ready to sell these products — has been a great experience. She says, “We are helping our seniors all the way through this process and that has helped us gain exposure.” Another student Shantanu Parkar agrees, “This project is not just close to our hearts but it has also helped us earn some money.” There’s demand for these kandeels from Indians living abroad, too. “People have asked for foldable kandeels, so we’re trying to figure out a way to do this. Our Indian community abroad have also asked for such specific ones. We use natural bamboo, which is not foldable and is tough to send abroad, but we’re working on this,” says Utsavi. Keeping up with the traditions, these budding entrepreneurs are also trying to create a range of different kandeels. “We have come up with Godadi Kandeels. Godadi (handmade light duvet or quilt) is another traditional, almost rural aspect that we want to highlight for urban Mumbaikars,” she adds. Students turn entrepreneurs this festive season, authentic kandeels are in demand this year||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/young-mumbaikars-make-sustainable-and-eco-friendly-kandeels-for-the-festive-season/articleshow/87361025.cms||Debarati S Sen

---||Gurgaon||Return of Banjara Market breathes life into Gurugrammers' festive shopping this Diwali||For years, Banjara Market has been the go-to Diwali shopping destination for residents of Gurgaon, Delhi and Faridabad due to the availability of quality inexpensive handicraft and other decorative items. This year, as the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) demolished the market due to encroachment concerns earlier this month, regular shoppers were worried they'd have to look elsewhere for their festive shopping needs. But much to shoppers' delight, the market is now back and running in multiple locations. The market was established in Sector 56 in Gurgaon around 15 years ago. Currently, some of the shops in the old market have returned while others are operating alongside the Golf Course Extension Road. Shoppers say they are glad their favourite market is back in time for their Diwali shopping. Dhananjay Verma, a Sector 32 resident, says, "My whole Diwali shopping used to be at the Banjara Market each year for the last many years. I was disappointed that the market was gone. But I was surprised to find it up and running when I passed by the spot last week. My wife and I will head over there this weekend to shop for the festive season." Rishi Jain, who shopped there a few days ago, adds, "It's much smaller now and fewer shops but the stuff is all there." Sellers in Sector 56 say the crowds haven't descended the way they usually do before the festival but it could be due to lack of knowledge about the market being active again. "More people should come as word is spreading that we are back in operation," hopes one shop owner. The market offers a variety of tea light candle standsWith a smaller offshoot of the market operating on Golf Course Extension Road, those who live in the societies beyond that are happy too. Arpita Shah, a resident of Sector 67, tells us, "While it's agreed that encroachment must be tackled and the market must be regularised, one should not snatch away the livelihood of so many people. Also, over the years, the market has become an inalienable part of Gurgaon. The variety available there and the prices are quite good. I am glad I won't have to drive down to Sector 56 to buy stuff from there anymore. It has moved much closer." The market is known for handicraft and home decor goods Others, mostly those who live close by, are wary of the chaos the market causes during festive season. Mohammad Ayub, who lives a stone's throw away from the market in Sector 56, says, "Parking is a huge issue. I hope all that has been thought of before restarting the market. I see it is in a limited space and the service lanes aren't occupied anymore, which is a welcome change. But this market needs to be regulated so that it can run smoothly." An array of lamps are sold in the marketOnly few of the original shops remain at Sector 56In September, HSVP had sent a notice to shopkeepers at the market in Sector 56, ordering them to vacate the area as the market was set up over public land. In the first week of October, HSVP and Gurugram Police demolished the shops there after sellers moved out. Now, some of the shopkeepers have returned, occupying a small part of the erstwhile market. The shopkeepers claim that they are trying to come to an understanding with the local administration so that they don't have to be evicted. They further say that the stretch of land they are currently occupying is not public land and they are making sure not to inconvenience anyone. An official from HSVP tells us that their issue was with the shops being set up on public land and as long as they don't encroach on that, they can continue. Sources from the civic body say they are trying to find a middle ground so that the market may continue and public land isn't encroached upon. For now, the market has reduced drastically in size with almost no presence on the service lanes as was the case earlier. Only a handful of the original shops remain. Others have set up shop in various other parts of the city, a majority of them along the Golf Course Extension Road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/return-of-banjara-market-breathes-life-into-gurugrammers-festive-shopping-this-diwali/articleshow/87378034.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

It was the first concert where he played the sarangi and also performed as a vocalist. Kamal told us that he was happy that people appreciated his craft. “For the first time ever, I have played the sarangi and performed on a Sufi song at a concert. I will be doing more of it in the coming days. For me, it was like a sample audience, and I was a bit concerned about how my audience is going to accept it. I received great feedback, many attendees came to me after the concert and appreciated it. Some said that they wanted to invite me to perform at their concerts too,” he said. Kamal added that sarangi is very close to the human voice, and his training with Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and his father, sarangi maestro Late Sabri Khan, prepared him to take this step. He told us, “It was indeed an honour to perform. My father had taught several sarangi exponents across the world, and he was my guru, too. I feel that it was the training that I had with him and Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan sahab that helped me do this. Now, I am looking forward to performing at many such concerts in the coming months.” Kamal has been performing and practising during the pandemic at home. He has even recorded his recitals for an album, which he will release soon. He said, “I want people to listen to Indian classical and Sufi music, and understand its beauty. I have performed at many concerts across the globe, and the response has been amazing. Delhi’s audience also welcomes you with such warmth. I really missed these performances during the pandemic.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sabri-sarangi-and-a-sufiayana-evening/articleshow/87371334.cms||Niharika Lal

BKU leader Rajesh Tikait said their protest at the site would go on. “Delhi Police is removing the barricades on Supreme Court’s orders. We had told the court that it was the police which had blocked the road, not us,” he said. Delhi Police chief Rakesh Asthana said the decision to remove the barricades at Ghazipur and Tikri borders was taken to give a positive message following talks with farmer leaders and UP and Haryana cops. "The borders can't remain closed forever. We were in touch with various farmers' factions and leaders and discussions were also undertaken in Union ministry of home affairs. We decided that, as a positive approach, the barricades should be removed for now," said Asthana. Due to the barricades, interstate travel of people and commercial vehicles was impacted. "We hope that in future the situation will improve and normalcy is restored," said the police chief. Asked about its impact on law and order, Asthana said appropriate measures would be taken as and when required. "If any law and order situation develops, we will handle it accordingly. We will act in a graded manner. We are prepared for and can handle any situation. We want to give a message that the situation is normal," he added. On Thursday afternoon, Delhi Police started reducing the layers of security at Tikri border and the same drill was carried out at Ghazipur border on Friday. The removal of the containers and cement boulders at Tikri was a prequel to the opening of one carriageway of the arterial road. However, police said a high-powered committee constituted by the Haryana home department was looking into it. The panel would take a call on resumption of traffic on the Haryana-Delhi borders at Singhu and Tikri. Delhi Police was apprehensive about the law and order situation at the borders after the Republic Day violence this year and heavy deployment, apart from enhanced security measures, had continued there for months. Meanwhile, commenting on the recent step to form new units within Special Cell to handle jihadi and Khalistani terror modules, Asthana said, "Delhi Police has to be prepared for the future. We're making changes in the current system to make it more efficient and effective. It was imperative to reorganise and strengthen Special Cell. We have added new officers and new units to it."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-11-months-delhi-border-barricades-start-coming-down/articleshow/87380235.cms||---

The bone of contention is the existence of Jothy Bar at a distance of 114.5 metres from the entrance of the Throwbathiammam Temple in Puducherry, well beyond the statutorily prescribed minimum distance of 100 metres between a watering hole and place of worship. Appearing for a PIL petitioner, who had appealed against a Madras HC's decision refusing to close down or relocate the bar, advocate Nandkumar told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna that because of the small distance between the bar and the temple, many persons get drunk and then come to the temple creating ruckus and often disturb temple rituals and festivals. "Even if the bar is not closed down, it can be relocated in deference to the public sentiments," he argued. Justice Chandrachud said, "We do not want to hurt religious sentiments of the devotees. But, once the statutory distance between the two is maintained, there is little the courts can do legally. Moreover, the temple trust has not objected to the existence of the bar in close proximity. Why should we interfere with the High Court decision?" When Nandkumar yet again argued the nuisance created at the temple by those getting drunk at the bar, Justice Nagarathna said, "Even if the bar is at 500 metres or 1000 metres away, people who take drinks and then want to visit temple could also create the same kind of nuisance." A HC bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on July 16 had set aside a single judge bench's order directing the authorities to cancel the license of the bar. On appeal, the division bench of the HC said, "The distance from the outer extremity of the precincts of the bar to the entrance of the Throwbathiammam Temple is shown to be 114.5 metre, which is well in excess of the prohibited distance." "In the light of such finding, there does not appear to be any basis for the licence granted to the relevant bar to be cancelled, since the bar is not located within the prohibited distance, nor does it fall foul of any other condition," the HC bench had said. However, the HC had clarified that the authorities could take necessary steps, if the land that separates the bar and the temple is used by the temple authorities for regular religious purposes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/some-pray-others-drink-sc-wont-shut-bar-near-temple/articleshow/87380315.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Completion of the term would make Das the longest-serving governor in almost seven decades and second-longest in RBI's history. The longer-than-expected tenure is seen by the markets as a message that the government wants to ensure continuity.  The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet issued its order on reappointment late on Thursday. "The reappointment of Das for a three-year term signals continuity of monetary policy and gives greater stability to government-RBI relations," said Rahul Bajoria, India economist at Barclays in a note. "We also view the governor's reappointment as a vote of confidence in the RBI policy stance." He pointed out that RBI had done most of the heavy lifting during the Covid crisis. Das had taken charge as governor on December 11, after his predecessor Urjit Patel resigned a year ahead of the completion of his term. Immediately before Das took charge, the relationship between the central bank and the government had plunged to a low after Patel and his deputy Viral Acharya's battle with the government over the independence of the apex bank. Upon taking charge, the retired civil servant had to face criticism for not being an economist and was identified as a government person as he was at the forefront of government briefings during demonetisation. He has, however, adopted a collaborative approach and soothed the relationship between RBI and the Centre. Das' reappointment comes following his deft handling of the economic crisis in the wake of the pandemic. The governor's immediate challenge in his second innings would be normalising the sea of liquidity in the money markets estimated to be at over Rs 10 lakh crore without hurting the nascent recovery. He also has to put in a framework for giving bank licences and for enabling privatisation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/shaktikanta-to-be-rbi-guv-for-3-more-years/articleshow/87380523.cms||---

We are totally against award,” a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi told Dr Vinod G Kulkarni, a Hubballi-based consulting neuropsychiatrist and advocate. “The petitioner has not been able to satisfy the court as to why any indulgence should be granted by the court for the relief claimed. Awards such as Padma or state awards are given at the discretion of the state or the central government. No person has any right to claim that he should be given any such award. The petition being devoid of merits is dismissed,” the bench stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/court-dismisses-pil-seeking-padma-awards-for-sitting-judges/articleshow/87380703.cms||---

They shut their shops at 11am and sat on SP Road.“On Thursday evening, three of our shopkeepers were attacked with stones by these touts loitering around the area claiming to fix cellphones and cheating people. The are creating trouble for genuine sellers here. They harass customers, which is bringing a bad name to law-abiding sellers,” said Mahavir Pagaria, president of Bangalore Electronics Dealers Association, who led the agitation.The Thursday incident unfolded allegedly after one of the shopkeepers on AM Lane objected to some touts smoking contraband outside his shop. An argument ensued and the suspects ganged up and assaulted three shop owners with stones and sticks. “This is not a one-off incident as these illegal vendors and their agents have been making life hell for us traders for the last three years. Quarrels between traders and them have become common and this is the third incident of attack,” Arun Jain, the joint secretary of the association, who was also part of the protest, said.The traders’ union on Thursday approached Ulsoor Gate police station following the assault and lodged a complaint. Police have registered an FIR and probe is on.Meanwhile, cops arrived at the site on Friday and assured the traders that necessary action would be taken against the culprits.With 1,500 shops, the SP Road electronics market is the biggest in Bengaluru.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 4.4 lakh voters to seal fate of 19 bypoll candidates today||BENGALURU: Nearly 4.4 lakh voters will decide the fate of 19 candidates in the byelections to the Hangal and Sindgi assembly seats on Saturday. The polling began at 7am and it will continue till 7pm. The bypolls have been necessitated as the seats fell vacant following the deaths of Sindgi JD(S) legislator MC Managuli and BJP’s CM Udasi from Hangal. The high-voltage campaign saw leaders from all three major parties making personal attacks against each other. While chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and his predecessor BS Yediyurappa launched a joint campaign, the Congress’ canvassing was led by opposition leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC president DK Shivakumar. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and former CM HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) spent more time campaigning in Sindgi. This election is significant for the three parties to assess and assert their influence ahead of the 2023 general elections, but more importantly for Bommai to prove that he can step into the big shoes of his predecessor and former CM BS Yediyurappa. The central leadership will be keeping a close watch on the performance to consider whether Bommai can continue to lead the party into the election year. Since one of the two constituencies falls under his home district, it is also a prestige battle for the CM. Meanwhile, the Congress is also putting in some extra effort as it has lost most bypolls in recent times. For the JD(S), it is a matter of relevance in north Karnataka where its party base is minimal and also to know whether the regional outfit gets the backing of minorities. Having fielded Muslim candidates in the two bypolls, it is imperative for the father-son duo to save face by securing a respectable vote share if not retain the Sindgi seat which was previously held by their late MLA MC Managuli. Covid normsAll arrangements have been made to conduct the polls safely in the backdrop of the pandemic, said the Election Commission. Karnataka chief electoral officer (CEO) Manoj Kumar Meena said they are ensuring that Covid norms are followed at the polling stations with one health staffer being deputed at every location for screening of voters. “The last one hour will be reserved for Covid-positive voters,” said Meena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/4-4l-voters-to-seal-fate-of-19-bypoll-candidates-today/articleshow/87380708.cms||---

The number of women in the age group of 20 to 40 suffering from breast cancer has increased lately, say doctors. The possible reasons range from lifestyle changes to women now becoming more open to getting themselves tested and enabling diagnosis in early stages. Dr Tausif Ahmed Thangalvadi, medical director at NURA, said the risk of breast cancer starts rising after a woman turns 40, but it does not mean it does not affect younger women. “Women between 20 and 30 years of age must get themselves screened every alternate year,” he said and added that the reasons for rise in cases are family history, lifestyle-related causes like obesity and lack of exercise. NURA is a collaboration between Fujifilm Healthcare and Dr Kutty’s Healthcare, that offers AI-enabled imaging and expert healthcare. Dr Thangalvadi was speaking during a press conference held recently by NURA. Breast Cancer Awareness Month is on now. Dr Thangalvadi also said that in India, every four minutes, a woman is diagnosed with cancer and one woman dies of it every 13 minutes. Quoting from the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology’s February 2017 issue, he said: “Over the last 30 years, Bengaluru has seen the highest rate of increase in the incidence of breast cancer annually at 2.8%, compared to 1.4% for Delhi, 1.4% for Mumbai and 2.4% for Chennai.” According to the doctor, Bengaluru’s higher incidence could be because of the large migrant population in the city as well as greater awareness among the educated urban population, pushing them to get tested. Dr Vijay Agarwal, lead consultant of medical oncology at Aster RV Hospital, said that the overall increase in cases is also not just because of regular or increased testing. “But probably now we are diagnosing women with breast cancer in early stages, whereas earlier women with breast cancer would often be identified in the late stage, where the prognosis would be poor and these women would fall off the radar...,” he added. Dr Nitin Yashas, consultant medical oncologist and Dr Rohit Kumar C, a consultant surgical oncologist, at Columbia Asia Hospital on Sarjapur Road (a unit of Manipal Hospitals), said many studies have shown that breast cancer in India presents at a younger age (between 40 and 50 years) as compared to the western world where it is more common after 60 years. “It is very important to break the stigma associated with breast cancer. Early detection helps in increased chances of cure and longer survival,” said Dr Yashas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/docs-rise-in-breast-cancer-among-20-40-age-group/articleshow/87380711.cms||Farheen Hussain

The latest Cleartrip deal will be routed through the tycoon's listed flagship Adani Enterprises, which will acquire about 20% in the holiday booking site, said a person in the know. The deal will also boost his airport management business as travel rebounds after Covid-related curbs are eased and vaccination rises. Flipkart had bought Cleartrip for about $40 million in a distress sale in April this year. Adani Enterprises did not disclose the amount it will invest in Cleartrip but said it would get "board nomination rights and certain investment protection rights". The Ahmedabad-based conglomerate's digital play comes at a time when rival groups - Tatas and Reliance Industries (RIL) - have been consolidating their e-commerce interests. Tata has soft-launched its superapp, covering a swathe of its consumer services and products. While RIL, controlled by Mukesh Ambani, is buying a controlling stake in local search engine, JustDial. With Adani Group emerging as India's largest private sector airport operator (in terms of number of airports and not in terms of passenger volumes), the Cleartrip deal will increase its travel play. After Cleartrip was acquired by Flipkart, Adani said in a statement that the holiday booking site has "seen 10 times growth in flight bookings". Moreover, it too observed that the number of passengers at airports has increased, reaching close to pre-covid highs. The Cleartrip deal will enhance the relationship between Adani Group and Walmart. In April, the conglomerate inked a pact with Flipkart to build one of India's largest warehousing hubs and data centres. At that time, group company Adani Logistics said it would build a 5.3-lakh-sqft fulfilment centre in Mumbai and lease it to Flipkart, while Flipkart will build a data centre at Adaniconnex in Chennai. "While Flipkart will run Cleartrip, the move gives Adani Group a toehold in the online travel space, which is set to boom," said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-buys-20-stake-in-cleartrip/articleshow/87380730.cms||---

During fiscal 2021, we earned nearly one-third of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam. We are optimistic about the future, especially as we see strong demand for our new products,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts after the iPhone maker’s fourth quarter results.For the three months ended September, Apple reported revenue of $83 billion, up 30% compared to last year. For the full year, revenue rose 33% to $365 billion. Revenue from what Apple call `Rest of Asia Pacific', which includes India, was up 37%. Apple does not break up revenue by country. This is the second consecutive quarter that Apple has performed well in India, where the market is dominated by Chinese smartphone makers and Samsung. For the quarter ended June, Apple set record numbers in the country and achieved double-digit growth.The California company was the fastest growing brand in the third quarter in India, growing at 212% and leading the premium smartphone market with a 44% share, as per data from Counterpoint Research. Premium smartphones are those which are priced above Rs 30,000. “The brand maintained its leading position in the ultra-premium segment (Rs 45,000+) with a 74% share. Strong demand for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 were the major factors in Apple’s growth. Apple became the top 5G smartphone brand in the premium segment for the first time,” according to Counterpoint analyst Tarun Pathak.Cook, however, warned that supply chain constraints – especially chip shortages which are impacting all sectors – will be larger heading into the holiday season. That negatively impacted its revenue by $6 billion in the recently concluded quarter. “Despite this challenge, we are seeing high demand for our products and expect to achieve very solid year-over-year revenue growth and to set a new revenue record during the December quarter,” Cook added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/apple-doubled-india-biz-last-fiscal-cook/articleshow/87380853.cms||Avik Das

The central government's counsel Kanu Agrawal informed a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar that the government in its affidavit has explained the fallacy in petitioner Rajeev Suri's contention that the vice-president's new residential complex near Rashtrapati Bhavan, under the Central Vista Project, would eat up the land earlier earmarked for public recreational purposes. The Centre said the new residential complex for the vice-president, which would allow him quick access to Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament, is on Plot No. 1 of Central Vista, located on Church Road near Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) Central Secretariat Bus Terminal, New Delhi. The area at present has only office complexes and the master plan has been amended to convert the land for residential purpose, it said. Whatever is the loss of existing public area because of the Central Vista project has been more than compensated for in the new plan, the Centre said. "Respondents (government and its agencies) have, considering the overall public purpose of the Central Vista and the overall vision behind the same, compensated and in fact, increased various public areas for the purpose of recreation and added numerous facilities in the overall master plan of the Central Vista project, which shall be public amenities, over and above the existing ones, for the larger benefit of the public," it added. The Union government said it was cognizant of the public nature of the Central Vista project and specifically seeks to add various public facilities to the larger vision plan and has suo motu created a lot of space for recreational purposes. "The North and South Blocks, which cover nearly 27 acres, and are proposed to be converted into national museums showcasing 'India in making', prehistoric to the present date. The museums will be open to the public at large and serve important public purposes," it said. "In addition to the same, nearly 118 hectare of land on the eastern and western banks of river Yamuna near Akshardham temple on the eastern bank and near IP thermal power station on the western bank is being developed as Amrut biodiversity park to commemorate 75 years of India's Independence fulfilling the recreational purpose aspirations of public at large," it added. On the Vice-President's new Residential Complex, the Centre said the existing VP Residence (VPR) is proposed to be relocated to the plot near North Block i.e. Plot No. 1. "This will in turn help in easing the traffic situation in Central Vista as the movement of VP will be mainly to the Parliament when in session. This will be well facilitated by the proposed VPR being in close proximity to the Parliament," it said. The government said the existing VPR plot shall be made available for three Common Central Secretariat buildings, which will form the Defense Enclave. "The proposed VPR will have all necessary, updated, latest technology-based security, Access Control, IT network for communication, facilities in terms of space to meet functional requirements," it said. As per the Development/Redevelopment Master Plan of Central Vista, North Block and South Block will not continue as Central Secretariat, but these two Buildings would be developed as National Museums. All the Central Government Ministries will be relocated in the Common Central Secretariat buildings which are being developed on two sides of the Rajpath on the current footprints of different buildings, the Centre said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biodiversity-park-to-come-up-on-yamuna-banks-in-delhi/articleshow/87380899.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Hussain was addressing a function organised to mark the inauguration of Craft Bazaar on the campus of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT)-Patna. As many as 20 stalls have been put up by artisans associated with artisan clusters formed in the state. Students of NIFT-P have also put up 12 stalls to display and sell various kinds of products. NIFT-P director Sanjay Srivastava said the minister, in his address, also assured the students of getting the in-campus auditorium building of the institute established expeditiously as it has been pending for long. Hussain went around each and every stall and interacted with the artisans and the students to enrich and enlighten himself about the designs. Besides, he also discussed with the students the work that was being done in the designing area at the institute, as well as about the management education that was being imparted and also the steps required for further improvement of craft sector. Hussain, during his interaction with the students and artisans, referred to the rich heritage of craft tradition, which needed to be promoted and taken to the wider public.

---||Business||IRCTC regains after govt drops call to share fees||TNN Mumbai: The uproar on Dalal Street against the railway ministry’s decision to have a 50% share of the convenience fee that IRCTC charges its ticket booking customers forced the government to withdraw it on Friday morning. The move was prompted also by the company’s suggestion to the ministry that the levy should be withdrawn as its revenues were yet to be back to pre-Covid levels, government sources said. Earlier in the day, the IRCTC stock had crashed nearly 29% on the back of the government’s decision that had come in Thursday’s post-market hours. Although the stock recovered most of its early losses after the government backtracked, it still closed 7.5% in the red at Rs 846 by close of Friday’s trading on the BSE. According to a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFS), the issue relating to sharing of convenience fee between the government and IRCTC “will always remain a key overhang until there is a clear policy from the government on the sharing ratio”. During fiscal 2020, the share of convenience fee to IRCTC’s total revenue was about 17%. If the company shares 50% revenue with the railway ministry, then the net impact of this on its earnings would be 23-25%. “Also, one of the biggest risks for IRCTC is that the government controls the fees charged by it to the public and has the authority to change it, which could lead to its resultant impact on the company’s financials,” MOFS head (equity strategy, broking & distribution) Hemang Jani wrote in the note.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/irctc-regains-after-govt-drops-call-to-share-fees/articleshow/87378575.cms||---
---||Business||Stressed realty: HDFC awaiting clearance for JV||TNN Mumbai: HDFC is keen to launch a real estate-dedicated asset reconstruction company (ARC) with Brookfield, one of the world’s largest realty management firms, chairman Deepak Parekh has said. HDFC is awaiting regulatory approval for the joint venture and aims to use it to provide last-mile funding and help resolve stuck projects. “We need such investors with deep pockets and who have long-term, patient capital,” said Parekh in his address to the country’s realtors at Credai Bankon 2021. Pointing out that an ARC will be a win-win situation for all, Parekh said that developers will get access to last-mile funding and existing financiers, having already provided for such loans, will have more options to sell bad loans seamlessly and focus on incremental lending rather than get embroiled in the legalities of resolutions. “It will also facilitate a new cadre of much-needed professionals with real estate expertise to resolve such loans,” said Parekh. Parekh said that the stressed assets in the real estate sector are estimated to be close to Rs 1.3 lakh crore, or about 18% of overall lending to the sector. “Fortunately, more resolutions are falling in place. Global investors, including otherwise conservative pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, are seeing immense opportunities in investing in Indian real estate to counter low or negative yields in their home countries,” said Parekh. According to Parekh, the world over, real estate ARCs are accepted financing vehicles. So, India too needs to catch up quickly. Responding to a question from a developer on the rising cost of commodity inputs, he said, “The market is ready to absorb the marginal increase in prices, but very steep increases — you will not be successful.” In his speech, Parekh said that it was the best of times for the housing and real estate sector. “In over 50 years, I have not seen housing affordability better than it is today, I have not seen such easy liquidity conditions and low-interest rates and, most importantly, I have not seen such a burning desire to be a homeowner than in these current times,” said Parekh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stressed-realty-hdfc-awaiting-clearance-for-jv/articleshow/87378413.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh HC allows farmers to take out padayatra to Tirupati||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Friday allowed Amaravati farmers to take out their padayatra to Tirupati with conditions. Observing that it is the right of farmers guaranteed by the Constitution and police cannot deny them their right to protest or take out a procession without valid reasons, the high court set aside the orders issued by the DGP’s office rejecting permission for the padayatra. The farmers, who have been protesting against the government’s capital trifurcation decision, planned to go on ‘Nyayastanam to Devastanam’ padayatra. After being denied permission, they moved the high court, which had earlier directed the DGP to consider their representation and take a decision in three days. The DGP on Thursday rejected permission for the padayatra after obtaining reports from SPs of Chittoor, Nellore, Guntur and Prakasam districts. Challenging the decision, the farmers moved the high court with a lunch motion petition seeking urgent hearing. Arguing on behalf of the farmers, Posani Venkateswarlu said the farmers had given an undertaking that they would follow all guidelines. The additional advocate general, arguing on behalf of the police, said the farmers will not have any control over the crowds and who joins them en route. As Covid-19 fears have still not subsided, it is not appropriate to permit such a large group to go on padayatra. Considering the arguments, Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy said reasons cited by the police are not valid grounds for rejecting permission and allowed the padayatra by imposing certain conditions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-allows-farmers-to-take-out-padayatra-to-tirupati/articleshow/87377354.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Rahul Makhija, 23-year-old who had gone to Canada after completing his Bachelors in Business Administration (BBA) from M S University in 2019, drowned in the Bruce Peninsula near Toronto about eight days ago. Rahul’s body arrived in Ahmedabad on Friday evening and was brought to the city late night. His body will be cremated in the city on Saturday. Sunil Makhija, Rahul’s father, told TOI, “Rahul and his friends had gone to Bruce Peninsula National Park – a popular tourist attraction - on October 20. Some of them jumped off a cliff into the water below. But the water was freezing cold. Rahul went below the water surface but his friends realised that something was wrong when he didn’t come up for a few minutes. His friends pulled out his body and the local guards tried to resuscitate Rahul. But they couldn’t save him.” Makhija further said that Dr George Harpur, who examined Rahul’s body there, told a local website that Rahul died due to drowning. Harpur also said that Rahul didn’t seem to be equipped for swimming and that the water temperature was minus 15 degree Celsius. “Rahul had just completed a digital marketing course in Seneca College near Toronto and was planning to take up another course,” told the father of the deceased who owns a saree shop in old city. He further said that they had to face a tough time while bringing back Rahul’s body to Vadodara as there was a lot of paperwork involved. Deceased was BBA student association’s president in MSU and was staying in Scarborough. Rucha Manohar, who was Rahul’s schoolmate, remembered him as an active student. “Rahul always wanted to get things done and wanted to do something good in life,” she said. Vadodara BJP MP, Ranjan Bhatt stepped in a couple of days ago and helped the Makhija family with all necessary contacts. “I contacted the Ministry of Civil Aviation headed by Jyotiraditya Scindia and they helped immediately. Rahul’s remains were brought to Ahmedabad on Friday by Air India,” Bhatt said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/gujarati-student-drowns-in-canada/articleshow/87377560.cms||---

The state, however, stands third in the overall number of farmer suicides in the country. A total of 889 people working in farm sector (farmers, tenant farmers and others) ended their lives in Andhra Pradesh in 2020 while the number was 1,029 in 2019. The latest data of the National Crime Record Bureau’s, accidents and suicides in India-2020, shows that Andhra Pradesh occupied third place in terms of the number of farmer suicides in 2020, behind Maharashtra (4,006), Karnataka (2,016) and Andhra Pradesh (889). In 2019, Andhra Pradesh stood third in the country in farmer suicides. The NCRB data depicts only the profession of persons, who have committed suicide and has no linkage whatsoever regarding the cause of suicide. Of the 889 farmer suicides in the state in 2020, 805 were male and 84 female. The data also show that 424 suicides were by farmers, who cultivate their own farmland, 140 by those who cultivate on lease land and 325 were engaged as agricultural labourers. Speaking to TOI, secretary of Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an umbrella association of farmers’ groups and NGOs, B Kondal Reddy, said their field survey has showed that Covid-19 increased suicide of farmers in Chittoor, Kurnool and Anantapur districts of Rayalaseema. Farmers, who had grown tomato, banana, and a few other crops in the Rayalaseema region, ended their lives due to poor marketing facilities and incurred losses during Covid-19 in 2020, he added. “We found that most of the farmers, who committed suicide, were either small farmers (who own around two acres of land) or tenant farmers only in the state. The common reason for the suicides of farmers is mounting debts, lack of market price for their agricultural produce, and the tenant farmers being deprived of benefits from the government. We are appealing to the government to provide remunerative prices of agriproducts to save the farming sector,” Kondal Reddy added. The Andhra Pradesh government had launched YSR Rhythu Bharosa scheme in October 2019. The scheme provides Rs 13,500 to farmers per annum and over 44.92 lakh landowning farmers and 1.58 lakh tenants benefit through the scheme. Meanwhile, agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu slammed certain reports for ‘falsely interpreting’ the NCRB data. Although the NCRB does not mention the cause of suicides, these reports are deliberately trying to irk the government by stating the number of farmer suicides has increased, he said. He added that the commissioner of the agriculture department has brought the issue of contradictions in data to the notice of the DGP, as it is the police department that provides the data to the Centre. The government has disbursed compensation to 466 families of farmers who committed suicide, Kannababu said, adding that farmers’ distress is being addressed through various initiatives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/farmer-suicides-fall-13-in-ap-but-state-occupies-third-place-in-india/articleshow/87377153.cms||Nalla.Babu

The government has already directed the officials of the endowments department to come up with plans to develop the temples based on their category. There are temples headed by the chief executive officer of the rank of joint commissioner, some headed by deputy commissioner, and some with assistant commissioner. According to the officials, the temples at Simhachalam in Visakhapatnam district, Annavaram in East Godavari district, Dwaraka Tirumala in West Godavari district, Vijayawada in Krishna district, Srisailam in Kurnool district, Srikalahasti and Kanipakam in Chittoor districts are headed by an officer of the rank of joint commissioner. These temples would have a master plan similar to that of the TTD, protecting the sanctity of the temple and providing amenities to the visiting devotees. The sanctum sanctorum of the temples and the places of offerings should be rebuilt if required so as to provide an improved and secure look. The government has also asked the officials to have ‘Mukhadwaram’ – arch at the main entrance – that should reflect the importance of the temple. “As the devotees walk through the Mukhadwaram, they should feel that they are entering into the holy place,” an official asserted and added that the structures should inspire feelings of devotion in visitors. Once the master plan for these temples headed by joint commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners is ready, the government also plans to rework the 41 other temples that are also equally important and popular in their respective areas. There are eight temples headed by joint commissioner, three headed by deputy commissioner and 35 temples headed by assistant commissioner cadre in the state. The officials were also asked to redesign places where devotees queue up, queue complexes, resorts for devotees and parking slots. The government has asked the officials to ensure that there is a parking place at every temple. The officials were also directed to plan guest rooms depending on the number of devotees visiting the temple and the numbers that prefer an overnight stay. The government has asked officials to ensure that the infrastructure provided now should be sufficient for the next 20 to 25 years.

The government has also agreed to escrow 50% of funds pooled through road development cess levied on petrol and diesel as a counter guarantee to the banker. Although the government will repay the loan amount to the bank directly from the treasury, the banker insisted on opening the escrow account as an additional guarantee. The government has been levying Rs 1 per litre of petrol sold as road development cess for the past year and expects to earn Rs 500 crore annually from this. In fact, AP Road Development Corporation (APRDC) borrowed around Rs 3,000 crore from financial institutions in 2019 for taking up road maintenance works, but the funds were allegedly diverted by the TDP government to extend financial assistance to women under the Pasupu Kumkuma scheme before the 2019 general elections. The diversion of funds left the APRDC penniless and the roads in a poor condition. Now, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the roads and buildings (R&B) department to launch repairs on state highways and major district roads. “We have succeeded in getting the loan of Rs 2,000 crore from Bank of Baroda to take up the work. We will be signing on the loan agreement shortly and launching works,” said principal secretary (transport, roads and buildings) MT Krishna Babu. Krishna Babu said the government had wanted to start repair work in March but was delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19 and later, heavy monsoon rains across the state. The chief minister has already accorded permission to take up work at a cost of Rs 2,205 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/govt-secures-rs-2k-cr-loan-for-road-repairs/articleshow/87377274.cms||Samdani MN

The deceased, identified as Aniruddh Singh, 50, was a native of Bagra village under Hathua police station area in Gopalganj. Hathua police station SHO Vijay Singh said Singh had left home for Mirganj at around 3am for some work related to his sand trading in Gopalganj. He said he was killed while returning home. Mirganj police station SHO Chhotan Kumar said when Singh neither reached home even after a few hours nor responded to the phone calls, his family members started searching for him. “Some villagers located his body near Matihani. “He was shot once in the chest. No empty cartridge was recovered from the spot,” he said. Kumar said Singh was probably shot between 4 and 4.30am. “Neither anyone heard any firing sound nor witnessed the incident,” he said.

The body has been handed over to the family after postmortem,” he said. He said police are gathering information from technical investigation to zero in on the suspects in the case. “Police will also analyse the call detail record of Singh to know with whom he was in touch recently,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/50-year-old-sand-trader-killed-in-gopalganj-district/articleshow/87376175.cms||---

The DM said apart from the ghats, parks and ponds near different temples and other places would be used by the Chhath devotees to perform rituals. “As the water level has increased at several ghats and there is also erosion and swamp, the civic body officials have been asked to start cleaning and make necessary arrangements at the artificial ponds and other water bodies,” Singh said. “We need to be extra cautious keeping in mind the safety protocols for Covid-19. Magistrates and police personnel will be deployed for crowd management and traffic regulation on the roads leading to ponds and parks. Changing room and other facilities like drinking water, lights and urinals will be there for the devotees,” the DM said. He said there are at least 8-10 big parks in the city where water bodies and ponds are available, including Patna zoo. Altogether 18 ponds are located in the New Capital circle, six in Patliputra circle, five in Kankarbagh circle, four in Bankipore circle and two in Patna City circle of the PMC. Rakesh Kumar Singh, executive officer of the PMC’s New Capital circle, said cleaning work has already started at all the 18 ponds and water bodies. “We are dewatering the small ponds for thorough cleaning, which will be done before Diwali. Based on the depth, barricading will be done and platforms made for Chhath devotees. The work will be completed by November 4,” he said.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the heads of departments (HoDs) chaired by the PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur on Friday. The meeting resolved to strictly enforce the rules of the National Medical Commission and the Aryabhatta Knowledge University regarding compulsory attendance for clinical, non-clinical and paraclinical departments running the undergraduate (UG) course of MBBS and postgraduate courses (PG) courses like MS and MD. Thakur said compulsory attendance (75% or 80% for different courses) in both theoretical and clinical classes for appearing in examination would help students pursue their academic career with full dedication. All the HoDs attending the meeting were directed to verify attendance before declaring them sent-up. It was also decided to act tough against any indiscipline, be it by students, staff or junior and senior doctors. The issue of attempt to create disturbance in the healthcare services by interns as part of protest was also discussed in the meeting. “Forced closure of registration counters or OPDs, acts of scuffle or assault on anyone and denial of medical service on any plea would amount to indiscipline and invite sternl action,” said Thakur. Apparently, the decision came after unconditional withdrawal of two-day protest by MBBS interns for hike in their stipend. Though the PMCH officials were vigilant near all the OPDs and registration counters, which were forced closure by protesting interns on Thursday, to ensure proper functioning at all places without any disturbance. Heads of all about 25 departments were present at the meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/75-attendance-must-in-pmch/articleshow/87375140.cms||VK Tripathi

Addressing mediapersons here, Tejashwi alleged saris were being distributed among women in the name of Chhath festival. He also shared a video with the mediapersons to substantiate his claim. Tejashwi also criticised the police for illegal liquor business in the state. “I have an eye on everything and treachery will no longer be tolerated. I have kept a helicopter and the moment I get information about any misdeed on the voting day, I will rush to the spot,” Tejashwi said. Tejashwi added it was on his party’s complaint to the Election Commission that DSP Dillip Kumar Jha was relieved from election-related duties in Darbhanga. Meanwhile, JD(U) state spokesperson and former MLC Neeraj Kumar said Tejashwi was levelling baseless allegations. “One should properly see the video. Has the CM distributed saris? Tejashwi knows he will get defeated. Since his father had also campaigned with him, it will be a big shame for them. Hence, he is coming up with such allegations,” Neeraj said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tejashwi-jdu-luring-voters-with-cash-liquor/articleshow/87376171.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Business||Godrej Group’s plan to split enters next stage||TNN Mumbai: A process of restructuring that the 124-year-old, $4-billion Godrej Group initiated a few years ago is said to have progressed and is likely to see an amicable settlement. According to sources close to the family, although the needle has moved quite a bit on the possible division into two factions — Adi Godrej, Nadir Godrej & family (Godrej Industries & associates) on the one side, and Jamshyd Godrej & family (Godrej & Boyce, or G&B) on the other — the exercise is restricted to the realm of how cross-holdings would be untangled. The moot point remains as to whether — and, more importantly, how — the huge land holdings under the unlisted G&B would be divided? Sources said there’s no discussion on a division of the land holdings yet. Close to 3,401 acres are housed under G&B, the holding company which clocked a turnover of Rs 11,400 crore and a net profit of Rs 224 crore in 2019-20. Although G&B is one-third the size of Godrej Industries & associate companies, the land holdings can boost G&B’s valuation significantly, said sources. G&B and Godrej Industries & associate companies have been operating independently for decades, although family members sit on the boards of group companies and directly or indirectly hold stakes in group entities. Adi Godrej, who recently stepped down from the listed companies’ boards, continues to be on the board of G&B. A joint statement from the two sides stated, “The Godrej family has been working on a long-term strategic plan for the group for the last few years to ensure best value for its shareholders. As part of this exercise, we have also sought advice from external partners. These discussions between the family remain ongoing.” A source told TOI the process is being deliberated “in a very amicable way”. Five family branches under Adi Godrej, Nadir Godrej (brother of Adi), Jamshyd Godrej, Smita Crishna (sister of Jamshyd) and Rishad Godrej (cousin of Adi, Nadir, Jamshyd) hold 15.3% each in G&B, while the Pirojsha Godrej Foundation holds around 23%. The trusts invest in environment, health and education sectors. Dividends from various group companies are used to fulfil these philanthropic activities. G&B, in turn, has holdings in various group companies. TOI had, in its edition dated June 27, 2019, reported about the move towards a split. TOI had reported that investment banker Nimesh Kampani and lawyer Zia Mody are advising Jamshyd Godrej while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Uday Kotak and Cyril Shroff of legal firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas are assisting Adi Godrej. The Godrejs have not had disputes of the kind seen in other family businesses because of a policy that has been followed from one generation to the other, where every member’s shareholding gets equally divided among the member’s children. That leaves no scope for dispute. The thinking that’s now driving a restructuring is keeping the future of the group — as also the next few generations — in mind. For one, the structure was getting too complex. Members of the fourth generation of Godrejs are already in leadership positions within group companies. Adi Godrej’s daughter Nisaba is chairing the board of Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL), while son Pirojsha is chairman of Godrej Properties. Pirojsha is said to be the one driving the talks on the future of the group. Adi Godrej’s eldest daughter Tanya Dubash is chief brand officer of the group. On the other hand, while Jamshyd’s son Navroze is said to be pursuing his personal interests, Smita and Vijay Crishna’s daughter Nyrika Holkar, a qualified solicitor, is executive director at G&B and is leading the digital strategy for the group. Increasingly, Nyrika is being seen as a successor to Jamshyd Godrej at G&B. “There’s no ambiguity there. Nyrika has been steering the ship at G&B under Jamshyd’s guidance, for a few years now,” said sources. “The members of the Godrej family share cordial relations with each other and the objective of such a restructuring would only be to make the structure a little less complicated before the fifth generation of Godrejs enters the business. One doesn’t see the family going to an arbitrator for such an exercise,” said an industry source. The privately held G&B is into appliances, construction, precision engineering, furniture retailing and aerospace, among other sectors, while Godrej Industries is the holding company which has interests in consumer goods, agriculture, real estate, chemicals and financial services, other than incubating new businesses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/godrej-groups-plan-to-split-enters-next-stage/articleshow/87378607.cms||---

The de facto trustee of Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust, Prashant Mehta, had approached the court after the Palanpur city police did not register FIR on his complaint of theft of valuables from the safe allegedly by other trustees in 2019. Judicial magistrate Payal Goswami on October 27 directed the Palanpur City East Police Station to register an FIR under section 156 (3) of the CrPC and launch an investigation. The court said that it was not proper on part of the police to initiate an inquiry launched without registration of an FIR on Mehta’s complaint. It is not possible to investigate the case in proper manner without registration of an FIR. Mehta named nine persons in his complaint and claimed that in connivance with one another, they had carried out the loot of goods including diamonds, jewellery, silverware, fancy diamonds, and other items from the collection of Maharaja of Baroda from a safe vault in the basement of Mani Bhavan, which houses the Lilavati Hospital in Palanpur. He submitted that the valuables, which may be worth even more because of their antique value, belong to the Medical Trust and were kept in safe custody to expand the Lilavati Hospital in Palanpur. Mehta had approached the Gujarat high court last month seeking lodgement of FIR and complained that the police had visited the Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai and the trustees had shown the jewellery to the cops, but without taking any action, the valuables were returned to the trustees. The HC ordered Mehta to approach the magisterial court for appropriate legal remedy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fir-ordered-in-rs-45cr-lilavati-trust-jewellery-theft-case/articleshow/87377802.cms||---

Out of the 100 buses, 50 buses will run from Tirupati to Tirumala while the remaining buses will run from Tirupati to the nearest cities such as Kadapa, Nellore, Madanapalle and Renigunta.  APSRTC had initially proposed to introduce 350 buses on a Gross Cost Contract (GCC) basis. The tenders have also been invited for the same. As the price bids submitted by the two companies were higher than what the APSRTC anticipated, it has withdrawn the proposal for 250 buses it intended to introduce at Vijayawada, Guntur, Visakhapatnam and Kakinada.  APSRTC said in a statement on Friday that the price bid submitted by E-way Trans Private Limited, a subsidiary of MEIL, for 100 buses intended for Tirupati, is within the range in which further negotiations were held. As E-way finally agreed to run the buses at prices equivalent to that of Indra AC buses, the APSRTC agreed to allot the tender.

The government has already directed the officials of the endowments department to come up with plans to develop the temples based on their category. There are temples headed by the chief executive officer of the rank of joint commissioner, some headed by deputy commissioner, and some with assistant commissioner. According to the officials, the temples at Simhachalam in Visakhapatnam district, Annavaram in East Godavari district, Dwaraka Tirumala in West Godavari district, Vijayawada in Krishna district, Srisailam in Kurnool district, Srikalahasti and Kanipakam in Chittoor districts are headed by an officer of the rank of joint commissioner. These temples would have a master plan similar to that of the TTD, protecting the sanctity of the temple and providing amenities to the visiting devotees. The sanctum sanctorum of the temples and the places of offerings should be rebuilt if required so as to provide an improved and secure look. The government has also asked the officials to have ‘Mukhadwaram’ – arch at the main entrance – that should reflect the importance of the temple. “As the devotees walk through the Mukhadwaram, they should feel that they are entering into the holy place,” an official asserted and added that the structures should inspire feelings of devotion in visitors. Once the master plan for these temples headed by joint commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners is ready, the government also plans to rework the 41 other temples that are also equally important and popular in their respective areas. There are eight temples headed by joint commissioner, three headed by deputy commissioner and 35 temples headed by assistant commissioner cadre in the state. The officials were also asked to redesign places where devotees queue up, queue complexes, resorts for devotees and parking slots. The government has asked the officials to ensure that there is a parking place at every temple. The officials were also directed to plan guest rooms depending on the number of devotees visiting the temple and the numbers that prefer an overnight stay.

The government has also agreed to escrow 50% of funds pooled through road development cess levied on petrol and diesel as a counter guarantee to the banker. Although the government will repay the loan amount to the bank directly from the treasury, the banker insisted on opening the escrow account as an additional guarantee. The government has been levying Rs 1 per litre of petrol sold as road development cess for the past year and expects to earn Rs 500 crore annually from this. In fact, AP Road Development Corporation (APRDC) borrowed around Rs 3,000 crore from financial institutions in 2019 for taking up road maintenance works, but the funds were allegedly diverted by the TDP government to extend financial assistance to women under the Pasupu Kumkuma scheme before the 2019 general elections. The diversion of funds left the APRDC penniless and the roads in a poor condition. Now, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the roads and buildings (R&B) department to launch repairs on state highways and major district roads. “We have succeeded in getting the loan of Rs 2,000 crore from Bank of Baroda to take up the work. We will be signing on the loan agreement shortly and launching works,” said principal secretary (transport, roads and buildings) MT Krishna Babu. Krishna Babu said the government had wanted to start repair work in March but was delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19 and later, heavy monsoon rains across the state.

They alleged malpractices in publication of results and claimed that a candidate who got zero mark qualified the test. The pre-PhD test was conducted by the university on August 25 this year and the results were declared on September 2. The PIL was filed by one Kanchan Kumari and four others, who are represented in the court by counsel Shiv Pratap. The matter was taken up for hearing for the first time on October 26. Looking at the seriousness of the matter, the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice A M Badar issued a notice to the BRABU VC and four other officials of the university, asking them to file replies within four weeks. Counsel Raju Giri had appeared for the chancellor and Abhanjalli for the state government. Petitioners’ counsel had submitted that not only a candidate who secured zero mark in the test was declared qualified, but several others who had scored poorly cleared the test. In the PIL, the petitioners have cited UGC regulations that college teachers can be research associates but can’t be assistant professors and the university has flouted rules. The petitioners have also alleged that the university had roped in a Lucknow-based private software firm and paid it Rs 3 crore for printing of admit cards for the test. The admit cards, however, had several errors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/man-qualifies-pre-phd-test-despite-zero-mark-pil-filed-to-quash-results/articleshow/87375276.cms||---

Reeta Singh, senior scientist and head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Katihar), said, “Farming of jute in the district has been revived after a gap of several years because use of plastic bags has been banned. People have been asked to use jute bags or products made of biodegradable substances.” Singh said, “Farmers use traditional varieties for cultivation of jute. Before removal of fiber from jute plants, it is treated with water, besides microbial action is required. But, farmers put them in dirty or muddy water, which affects the quality of the fiber. Keeping them (harvested jute crops) in fresh water, besides using high quality varieties enhances the fiber quality. The processed fiber looks golden in colour. The poor quality looks blackish when processed. JRO 8432, JRO128, S19, JRO204, CO 58 are some of the high quality varieties for upping the output.” Farmers Sanjay Kumar of ward number 9 under Phulwaria panchayat, Mohammad Majboor Alam of Pachma village under Korha block of the district, also said that jute farming is far more profitable with less gestation period and input cost. The demand for gunny bags made of jute fiber is tempting farmers to go for jute cultivation, they agreed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jute-cultivation-revives-in-katihar/articleshow/87376188.cms||---

As per the data on Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) web portal, 1.99 lakh passengers had flown to and from Patna airport in September and 2.71 lakh flyers have done so in October so far, according to the information available on AAI-Patna’s Twitter handle. There has been a 34% growth in passenger footfall at the city airport due to the festive rush and a 36% rise in flight movement when compared to the previous month. The airport handled 2,600 flights in October and 1,754 in September. The highest footfall was recorded on October 17 just after Durga Puja when 6,541 passengers arrived at the airport and 6,584 left. Altogether 43 flights landed in the city and 43 took off from here. The executives of different airlines told this reporter, “With the easing of travel restrictions, more flights and passengers are expected to travel by air especially when Diwali and Chhath are round the corner. Compared to last month, the passenger footfall has increased. Almost all the flights travelling to and out of Patna are full.” The officials of CISF at the Patna airport said, “Most airlines are checking the vaccination certificates and RT-PCR reports of passengers travelling to other cities. Besides, random testing is also being done by the district administration.” Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh pointed out that over 700 people were undergoing test at the airport and Patna Junction every day to keep tabs on Covid-19. “Besides, a vaccination site has been created at the airport for those who have not been inoculated. We are planning to collect more samples of passengers arriving in Patna,” he said. The DM added, “Seeing the festive rush, I have asked the officials of the AAI-Patna and the CISF to manage the crowd inside and outside the terminal building.” A frequent traveller, Roshini Gupta, who was going to Delhi on Thursday, claimed, “Social distancing is not being maintained at the airport.” Another flyer, Samriddhi, said, “Although the passenger facilities have improved at the airport, it is difficult to manage the huge crowd especially during the festive season.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/passenger-footfall-up-at-city-airport-this-month/articleshow/87376226.cms||Faryal Rumi

Revenues for Q2 were up 78% to Rs 911 crore as compared with Rs 511 crore in previous Q2. The company, which announced an annual capex of Rs 99 crore in March, has now upped it by Rs 37 crore to expand its construction equipment and windmill parts production capacity, Srivats Ram, MD, Wheels India, said. Much of this expansion is export driven. The company has seen a growth in exports for five consecutive quarters with exports comprising 25% of sales in Q2FY22.  “By the end of the fiscal, despite domestic pick up in commercial and passenger vehicles, export share could be closer to 30%,” said Srivats Ram. The increase in steel and aluminium prices have also added to the company's revenue. “We have seen around Rs 200 crore on an annualised basis increase in sales due to steel and aluminium price hikes as customers have compensated us for it,” he added. As for headwinds, fuel price increase is a problem and the company is looking to move away from diesel to natural gas for cost purposes, said Ram. However because Wheels India has limited exposure to passenger vehicles, it has not been very badly affected by the semiconductor chip shortage.For the first half, the company recorded a net profit of just over Rs 31 crore as compared to a loss of nearly Rs 31 crore in the first half of the previous year. Revenues for the half year more than doubled to Rs 1,586 crore as compared to Rs 723 crore in H1FY21.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wheels-india-q2-net-profit-up-186/articleshow/87377375.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
---||Business||RBI eases rules for small biz in current a/cs||TNN Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has partially rolled back some of the stringent norms barring banks from opening current accounts for borrowers towards whom they have no credit exposure. “For borrowers, where the exposure of the banking system is less than Rs 5 crore, there is no restriction on the opening of current accounts or on the provision of cash credit/overdraft facility by banks, subject to obtaining an undertaking from such borrowers that they shall inform the bank, as and when the credit facilities availed by them from the banking system reaches Rs 5 crore or more,” the RBI said in a circular. The norms limiting current accounts to lenders who have a credit relationship was introduced to prevent diversion of funds by borrowers. However, it also caused problems for some borrowers who had opened accounts with banks that could provide internet banking support that their lending banks could not. The relaxation will benefit thousands of small businesses that were being forced to close long-standing transaction accounts with banks. Banks have been asked to implement the changes within one month. Borrowers who have availed of credit of over Rs 5 crore from the banking system can maintain their current accounts with only one of the banks with which they have a CC/OD facility. “Other lending banks may open only collection accounts subject to the condition that funds deposited in such collection accounts will be remitted within two working days of receiving such funds, to the CC/OD account maintained with the above-mentioned bank maintaining current accounts for the borrower,” the circular said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-eases-rules-for-small-biz-in-current-a/cs/articleshow/87378392.cms||---

---||Business||Adani buys 20% in Cleartrip in bid to boost superapp play||John Sarkar & Reeba Zachariah | TNN New Delhi/Mumbai: Billionaire Gautam Adani will acquire a “significant minority stake” in online travel and hotel booking firm Cleartrip — which had been acquired earlier by the Walmart-owned Flipkart — as he looks to launch a superapp, which will offer varied consumer services, including those from his conglomerate. The latest Cleartrip deal will be routed through the business tycoon’s listed flagship Adani Enterprises, which will acquire about 20% in the holiday booking site, said a person in the know. The deal will also boost his airport management business as travel rebounds after Covid-related curbs are eased and vaccination rises. Flipkart had bought Cleartrip for about $40 million in a distress sale in April this year. Adani Enterprises did not disclose the amount it will invest in Cleartrip but said it would get “board nomination rights and certain investment protection rights” in the online travel agency. The Ahmedabad-based conglomerate’s digital play comes at a time when rival groups — Tatas and Reliance Industries (RIL) — have been consolidating their e-commerce interests. Tata has soft-launched its superapp, covering a swathe of its consumer services and products. While RIL, controlled by Mukesh Ambani, is buying a controlling stake in local search engine, JustDial. With Adani Group emerging as India’s largest private sector airport operator (in terms of number of airports and not in terms of passenger volumes), the Cleartrip deal will increase its travel play. After Cleartrip was acquired by Flipkart, Adani said in a statement that the holiday booking site has “seen 10 times growth in flight bookings”. Moreover, it too observed that the number of passengers at airports has increased, reaching close to pre-covid highs. The Cleartrip deal will enhance the relationship between Adani Group and Walmart. In April, the conglomerate inked a pact with Flipkart to build one of India’s largest warehousing hubs and data centres. At that time, group company Adani Logistics said it would build a 5.3-lakh-sqft fulfilment centre in Mumbai and then lease it to Flipkart, while Flipkart will build a data centre at Adaniconnex in Chennai. “While Flipkart will run Cleartrip after the deal, the move gives Adani Group a toehold in the online travel space, which is set to boom in the coming months,” said a source. “For Flipkart, which already runs a horizontal marketplace, this partnership gives it a first mover advantage in the airport space,” the source added. Cleartrip will also serve as Adani Group’s online travel aggregator partner. The two will also collaborate in areas such as travel-related products, loyalty programmes and other value-added services, Adani Enterprises said. “As travel and passenger traffic is expected to increase in the coming months, digital travel platforms will be poised for growth. In my view, as corporates pivot their business to digital business models, M&A and investment deals to seize the digital opportunity are expected to increase. We have witnessed many deals combining physical with digital business models in recent months and digital business models, including travel and associated with travel, are likely to witness good deal demand from investors and acquirers,” said Grant Thornton Bharat partner & TMT leader Raja Lahiri.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-buys-20-in-cleartrip-in-bid-to-boost-superapp-play/articleshow/87378678.cms||John Sarkar

Gandhi had last appeared in court in June and denied making any defamatory comments against people with Modi surname. It is for the third time that he appeared in court on Friday since the case filed by under Indian Penal Code sections 499 and 500 was registered. In his complaint, Modi had alleged Gandhi of deriding the community with his statement, “How come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname?”, in political rally at Kolar in Karnataka on April 13, 2019 in the run-up to general election. Earlier, the complainant in the case had requested the local court to record statements of two additional witnesses who were part of the election commission’s team hired for videography of Gandhi’s speech, which the high court finally agreed to. After their statements were recorded in the case, Gandhi had to record his statement in the court. During half an hour’s presence in the court Gandhi’s statement was recorded in a couple of minutes. “He told the court that he is not aware about it in his reply to the statements recorded by two additional witnesses. He did not speak about anything else,” said Kirit Panwala, who represented Gandhi in the case. “Gandhi has been permitted to not remain present in the court in every hearing but following specific orders he remained present.” Modi, who was also present in the court, however, refused to comment on media questions. “We requested the court to allow recording of statements of two more witnesses, who are also part of the election commission’s team that was involved in video recording of the speech and storing data. The court will hear our case on Saturday,” said B V Rathod, Modi’s lawyer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/rahul-gandhi-records-statement-in-surat-court/articleshow/87377788.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar Agricultural University teachers stage 2-day hunger strike||BHAGALPUR: More than 300 teachers and scientists of Bihar Agricultural University (BAU) went on a two-day hunger strike against the authorities from Friday. The hunger strike was called by Progressive Teachers’ Association (PTA) and Sabour Agricultural University Teachers’ Association (SAUTA) against the inordinate delay in promotion under Career Advancement Scheme (CAS) of 2006 and alleged nepotism prevailing in BAU. The PTA and SAUTA alleged that promotion of BAU teachers has been pending for the last 15 years and the authorities are indifferent towards their genuine demands for over a decade. The PTA and SAUTA members allege that the BAU authorities have indulged in violation of some statutory provisions and regulations for promotion, whereas some junior scientists and officials are given more than one responsibilities. PTA secretary Hidyatullah Mir said the teachers and scientists are on peaceful hunger strike for their fundamental rights of getting timely promotion. “The delay is intentional in order to debar the eligible candidates from becoming a part of the administration,” Mir said. Abhay Mankar, secretary of SAUTA, alleged that the 15 years’ delay in promotion in accordance with the CAS is with malafide intention and compelled more than 300 teachers to form a coordination committee to fight for their justified demands. Dr Rambalak Prasad Nirala, president of SAUTA, said the two-day hunger strike is part of the series of peaceful protests. BAU authorities could not be contacted for their comments on the stir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bau-teachers-stage-2-day-hunger-strike/articleshow/87376213.cms||---
---||Delhi||Temples, havelis inspire Noida airport terminal's design||New Delhi: The upcoming Noida International Airport (NIA) won’t see too many transit passengers with Delhi’s IGI. The company in charge of building and operating the airport expects most of NIA’s footfall from its densely populated catchment area and domestic flyers to have a 90% share in passenger traffic in the initial phase. “I don’t see passengers taking connecting flights between IGIA and Jewar. That sounds pretty cumbersome even if the connectivity is very good,” NIA CEO Christoph Schnellmann told TOI. “I see both airports serving their respective catchments, their existing passenger demand. We expect a lot of point to point (air traffic) at Noida. There is no shortage of prime-time slots for airlines and we will offer transfers, both domestic and international. The terminal has been designed to ensure rapid transfers,” added Schnellmann. Swiss airport major Zurich AG’s 40-year concessionaire period to build and operate the Noida airport began on October 1. The Rs 5,730-crore project has to commence operations by the end of September 2024. “We are committed to delivering Phase 1 of the airport within three years,” Schnellmann said. NIA is at present selecting the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors for the airport. It will hand over the designs and tender documents to the shortlisted bidders to select two EPC contractors — one for the terminal and the other for “everything else”. According to Schnellmann, the terminal design will be “very much at home in UP, picking up architectural elements and materials from within the region”. The NIA CEO said the region’s “havelis and temple architecture” have inspired the design “The materials you will see, the stones and the very large forecourt in front of the airport, will reflect that,” he said. The airport’s “mixed rotation” boarding gates will allow docked aircraft to handle both domestic and international flights from the same bay. Which means once passengers disembark from a flight that has, say, come from Mumbai and the baggage is offloaded, the airline can board flyers to Dubai from the same gate without the plane requiring to taxi to a separate international wing. “We will offer domestic and international traffic from the same terminal, from the same parking position or gate. Arriving international, departing domestic and vice-versa. The terminal will be a multi-level structure allowing you to segregate passengers. So, if they arrive internationally, then they will follow a different course from domestic arrivals,” Schnellmann said. The airport will use digital technology widely for what the concessionaire describes as “a touchless experience”. “We are taking as many of the airport processes out of the terminal (as possible) and putting in the smartphone of passengers. The design and technology will ensure a quick seamless travel experience both for passengers inside terminals and for airlines in terms of operating the next flight after landing here. It will ensure quick connections,” said the NIA CEO. The masterplan for the airport also provides for helipads. Phase 1 of the airport will see a runway and a terminal with a capacity of handling 1.2 crore passengers annually. The terminal will be equipped with 10 aerobridges, with about 75% of passengers embarking and disembarking through them. Buses will be used for the rest. Reaching 80% of the 1.2 crore passenger mark will trigger the next stage of expansion in the first phase, which will see a mirror-image extension of the terminal building to handle an additional 1.8 crore passengers annually. “So, at the end of the first phase of development, we will have a runway and a terminal with a capacity of 3 crore passengers annually,” Schnellmann said. In the second phase, a runway and a terminal building will be added that will take NIA to its eventual capacity of 7 crore passengers annually. This terminal, like IGI’s T1, will be built in two phases. IGI airport’s eventual capacity is about 11 crore passengers. So, along with the NIA, Delhi-NCR’s total airport handling capacity could within a decade reach 18 crore passengers annually.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/temples-havelis-inspire-noida-airport-terminals-design/articleshow/87409597.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Rajiv Kumar Singh of JD(U) is pitted against Arun Kumar of RJD, Rajesh Mihra of Congress, Kumar Chandan of LJP (Ram Vilas), Vashishth Narayan Singh of Plurals Party and Upendra Sahni of Rashtriya Sambhavna Party. While the JD(U) candidate is from Kushwaha community, the RJD has taken a calculated risk by fielding a candidate from the Vaishya community. The Congress’s candidate is an upper caste Brahmin while the LJP (Ram Vilas) is relying on a Rajput. Sources said the upper castes and Vaishya (baniya) votes could prove to be the deciding factor in Tarapur. In Kusheshwar Asthan, There are around 2.57 lakh voters, including 1.21 lakh women, at 310 polling booths. The JD(U) has fielded Aman Hazari, the son of Shashibhushan Hazari, who had won the 2020 election.

Top leaders of all the major political parties, including CM Nitish Kumar of JD(U), RJD’s Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav besides Congress’s Meira Kumar, Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mewani and Hardik Patel had campaigned for their party candidates. Darbhanga DM-cum-district election officer Thiyagrajan S M told reporters that plying of private vehicles has been restricted and borders of the district sealed in the wake of the bypoll in Kusheshwar Asthan constituency.

N Ashwani Kumar, standing counsel for the high court, told the bench comprising Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice Lalitha Kanneganti that ‘Punch Prabhakar’ had posted one more such video on Thursday, when the issue was being heard in the high court. The CBI, which faced the ire of the high court on Thursday, questioned the role of social media intermediaries. The standing counsel for CBI, P Subash, told the court that social media intermediaries submitted to the court that they would remove any contemptuous content if they receive any complaint from prosecution agencies. However, they did not act on the two letters written to them with 16 specific URLs. Arguing on behalf of Google, YouTube and Twitter, senior counsel Sajan Poovaya said he’s not aware of any such letters by the CBI and apologised to the court if there has been any mistake on the part of the companies he was representing. He told the court that immediate action will be taken with regard to the URLs mentioned by the CBI. The court asked the CBI what action they have taken to trace ‘Punch Prabhakar’. As the CBI counsel replied they cannot do much as he’s in the USA, the high court expressed displeasure, saying they did not expect such a reply from the country’s premier investigation agency. Noting it’s been nearly a year since the case was registered, the bench directed the joint director of CBI to file an affidavit as to what they have done so far, what they can do, and what they cannot do in the case of Prabhakar and those living abroad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-pulls-up-cbi-in-derogatory-posts-case/articleshow/87377378.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The biography titled ‘Sultan Variyamkunnan’ written by script writer Ramees Mohamed O was released at a function held before the Variyamkunnath Kunjahammed Haji Memorial Municipal Town Hall. The book was released by Haji’s great granddaughter Hajara. The photograph of Kunjahammad Haji, who fought the British and established a short-lived parallel government named ‘Malayala Rajyam’ in parts of Malabar, before he was captured and shot dead on 1922, has not been in the public domain at least in the country and his images used to be portrayed through drawings. The British had burnt his body along with all records and documents related to the parallel government. Mohamed said that the research team for the book got Haji’s photograph from a French publication one-and-half years ago. He said Ashkar, a member of the research team, found Haji’s photo from a French publication. “The book has rare photographs of battles waged as part of the Malabar Rebellion in 1921. Also, a letter written by Haji to the US, published in American newspapers, has been included in the book,” he said. Mohamed was one of the scriptwriters of the film project Variyamkunnan announced by Ashique Abu- Prithviraj duo, who later withdrew from the project. He said that he first read about Haji in a British publication when he was in the UK. “The book mentioned that Haji created a parallel government in Malabar and was the first person in the country to do so after taking on the British and it kindled my curiosity. I took up research into the topic and we have been pursuing it for the past 10 years,” Ramees said. Writer P Surendran who inaugurated the function said that the leaders of Malabar Rebellion can take pride in the fact that they have not found place in the Sangh Parivar’s history books but their names will be written in golden letters in the book about the country’s democracy. The move by Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) to remove the names of leaders of Malabar Rebellion, including Variyamkunnath Kunjahammad Haji and Ali Musaliyar, from the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle had recently raked up a row.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/variyamkunnans-rare-photo-surfaces-on-book-cover/articleshow/87377709.cms||---

According to the water supply agency, many houses locked during the pandemic reported high water bills. “All zonal revenue officers are directed to identify all such cases in their areas where two to three-time of bill of high amount have been generated in the current billing cycle in comparison of the previous billing cycle. These need to be rectified immediately by way of recasting or adjustment,” said the directive issued by the director of the revenue wing of DJB. The move comes after Chadha, who was recently on a visit to a zone office of the agency in GTB Enclave, where this matter was brought to his notice. The vice-chairman then directed that such bills be immediately rectified to provide relief to customers and strict compliance of this order. “Officers concerned will ensure that all disputed bills of such nature have been rectified and delivered to customers.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sans DNA proof, man gets 10 years for raping minor||MUMBAI: Even as DNA evidence could not establish that a 58-year-old man had raped and got his daughter’s 13-year-old friend pregnant as the samples of product of conception were not properly collected and preserved, a special Pocso court convicted and sentenced him to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment on finding the child’s deposition trustworthy. While the accused said he had been falsely implicated over a prior feud between the families with police complaints being filed against each other, the court said it cannot be the reason to falsely implicate the accused at the cost of the child’s future. It also said the complaints dated back to 2011. “There is nothing to show that the family of the victim was influential and at their instance a false investigation was carried out to falsely implicate the accused,” special judge Bharti Kale said. The accused was also fined Rs 25,000, out of which Rs 20,000 will be given to the child after the appeal period is over. Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma cited the evidence of 12 witnesses, including the child and her mother. Refuting the defence argument that the doctor who had examined the child did not depose about her mood, the court said, “About the mood of the victim, at tender age of 13, she may not understand the gravity of the nature of sexual acts. The victim has deposed that she was upset for some days. However, she, being a child, playing was more important for her and so she continued playing even after the incident,” the court said. The court did not accept the defence claims that since there were 15 members in the family of the accused, including his wife, children, sons-in-law and grandchildren, he could not have committed the offence. The court said the accused had not established how big his family was or if anyone was present at home. “In such kinds of incidents, care and caution is taken by the predator that no one is present at the time of incident and people are unable to notice it,” the court said. The incident came to light in June 2018 when the teenager missed her period. Tests revealed the child was pregnant. She told the court she then revealed during a religious event in May 2018, when she went to the house of the accused to play with her friend, he sent his daughter out to buy something. He hit the survivor and sexually assaulted her. She said he did this on a few other occasions too. “On perusal of the evidence of the victim it does not appear that she was tutored,” the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sans-dna-proof-man-gets-10-years-for-raping-minor/articleshow/87378895.cms||Rebecca Samervel

During his interrogation, the accused also reportedly admitted to similarly smashing the head of another person with a large stone at Byculla 15 minutes before the JJ Marg crime on the night of October 23. He told the police he did not know either of the victims. Police are trying to establish the identity of the two victims. Investigators arrested the accused, Suresh Gauda, with the help of CCTV footage. Gauda reportedly told the police that he had been arrested in 2015 in connection with a similar murder in Kurla where he had killed a man by smashing his head. He was acquitted by the court in that case. Gauda, who lived on a pavement in Pydhonie area, collected and sold scrap metal, bottles and other waste for a living. Late on October 23, Byculla police had alerted other police stations about a murder; a person’s head was found smashed near the Byculla fruit market. In some time, JJ Marg police received a call about another person found similarly killed on a footpath in their jurisdiction. The police sent the body to a hospital for a post-mortem. Police teams scanned the CCTV cameras of the nearby areas in Byculla and JJ Marg and nabbed the accused from Mohammed Ali Road on October 24. The accused said he was walking on the road when he saw a man sleeping on the footpath. On seeing him, he took a large stone and smashed his head with it. He repeated the crime with a paver block upon coming across another sleeping person 15 minutes later. The accused has now been sent to judicial custody. Byculla police, which has also registered a murder case, will now move court to seek Gauda’s custody in the case. Gauda reportedly told the police his parents live in Karnataka. A police team will be visiting his parents. Police are trying to find out if Gauda had committed other crimes in the past. Cases with similar modus operandi will be at the centre of the probe. The motive in the two murders is still not known. and the police are making further inquiries. Dilip Sawant, additional police commissioner, south region, confirmed they have arrested the accused and the police are probing the case. Inspector Laxmikant Salunke is the investigating officer in this case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-stone-man-smashes-heads-of-2-asleep-on-footpaths-in-15-min-span-cctv-nails-him/articleshow/87378901.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Thwaha was released following the Supreme Court order granting him bail. He said that CPM and LDF had been speaking out against the black laws like UAPA on public platforms but the LDF government had no qualms in arresting him and his friend Allan. What is more alarming is that the LDF government has taken such a step when draconian laws are being introduced and executed in the country on a large scale. There must be special efforts to protect political activists, Thwaha said. He thanked all those who had stood by him during his period of detention. He said the Supreme Court decision of granting him bail, was a setback to the LDF government. He said that CPM leaders had not lent him any support when he was in jail since 2019. However, some of his friends, who were CPM sympathisers, used to contact him, and supported his family. The family members of Thwaha produced the Supreme Court order granting him bail at the NIA court in Kochi in the morning. Thwaha was produced before the NIA court through video conferencing. The NIA court then endorsed his release. He was finally released after the NIA court order was produced at Viyyur jail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/thwaha-lashes-out-at-ldf-govt/articleshow/87377767.cms||---

Justice Ilesh Vora has ordered authorities to process Patel’s request for PCC within 15 days on receipt of the order. The court directed so after it came to know that Patel’s husband and in-laws have filed a complaint of breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy against her with Mansa police, which have not registered it as an FIR. The police have already issued verification certificate to Patel after she approached the HC against police inaction. According to Patel’s advocate Nilay Patel, she went to Canada in 2016 on a work visa. She did not return to India since then and applied for permanent residence. When the process was initiated and immigration authorities sought a clearance certificate from police, Patel’s husband and in-laws objected to the process and the cops did not issue any certificate. The court made consul general of India a party in this proceeding because intervention was found to be necessary as the petitioner had filed her application for permanent residence of Canada in Toronto.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/expedite-cop-clearance-for-canada-move/articleshow/87377752.cms||---
---||Delhi||Illegal hawkers: Can’t let Delhi go to ruins, HC tells govt||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday refused to tinker with its earlier direction to remove illegal hawkers/vendors from Connaught Place. The court said the administration of the city cannot be held to “ransom” at the hands of street vendors and it won’t allow the “city to go to ruins”, while underlining that the order for removal of unauthorised vendors and hawkers from CP is as per law declaring the area a no-hawking zone. “Please get down to some real work. Enough of politics. Where is the (street vending) plan? You need to first come out with the plan. Unfortunately, we are saying with a lot of pain that you people are not acting in the spirit the Street Vendors Act is framed,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed, while the AAP government urged it to put on hold the crackdown against vendors till Diwali gets over so that the vendors can earn. “We are trying to streamline everything, be it Holi or Diwali…why should an illegal vendor or squatter or Teh Bazari be there in the first place? We will not mince our words. Don’t play politics. We mean business. We are giving you one opportunity to mend your ways now,” the bench said. “You have also not worked seriously while forming this town vending committee. You are forming TVC for New Delhi area but not including representatives from Connaught Place and Sarojini Nagar. We think the whole process is a mess. The way it is being worked out is completely wrong. We are sorry to say but it appears it is a complete mockery,” it told senior advocate Rahul Mehra and standing counsel Gautam Narayanan, when they urged the court to modify its earlier order. The court’s strong comments came while hearing a plea by New Delhi Traders’ Association, which represents shopowners and operators in CP area, seeking to strike down the 2019 Street Vendors Scheme. Senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, appearing for the association, argued there is no statutory plan for street vending as mandated under the Act and this needs to be prepared by New Delhi Municipal Council and notified by the government. Issuing notice, the court asked the government to specifically mention in the affidavit the justification for the constitution of the current TVC for New Delhi area and mention the background of the NGO members who are part of it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cant-let-city-go-to-ruins-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/87378905.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Ahmedabad||Staples’ cost bombs firecracker budget||AHMEDABAD: Come Diwali and firecracker dealers do bumper business. However, this year, the sales remained pretty much muted suggest dealers, thanks to eroding disposable incomes of people with essential items including fuel and vegetables getting costlier. This is the second consecutive year when fire cracker sales have remained low-key. Industry estimates indicate that the sales have plunged to 35-40% of pre-pandemic levels. Anjan Kotak, an Ahmedabad-based firecracker dealer said, “Compared to last year’s Diwali, the sentiment looks good. People are not spending as much on firecrackers with overall ticket size of purchases declining by 40%.” “Essential items have become costlier. Therefore, spending on firecrackers have reduced. People are spending more on apparel, food and even travel but not firecrackers,” Kotak added. This time, customers who tend to buy firecrackers are investing more in pistol rolls, fire pots and sparklers, among others, and are shunning very noisy and smoky fireworks, suggest dealers. A selection of green crackers, which are free from hazardous and polluting chemicals is also available in the market however, the demand is much less due to little awareness. This year, the prices of firecrackers have also increased. Due to increase in raw material costs, fireworks have become costlier by at least 10-15% suggest dealers. “Costlier firecrackers could also be one of the reasons for sales taking a hit thus far. It is less than a week to Diwali and two years ago, the customer rush at this time of the year was such that we hardly got time to have lunch or dinner on time. However, presently, the demand is extremely muted,” said Nadeem Pathan, a firecracker dealer. Bursting crackers is an age-old trend around Diwali. In many families, after Dhanteras or Diwali Pooja, people light the fireworks and it is mostly kids and youngsters who enjoy the festivities with colourful crackers. However, with greater awareness about the environmental hazards due to firecrackers, many have discontinued the practice. Vinayak Kumar, a class-8 student, said, “I enjoyed fireworks and firecrackers every single Diwali but as I learnt about the environmental hazards, I discontinued. Now, we light some flowerpots and a few sparklers after the Diwali pooja and that’s all.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/staples-cost-bombs-firecracker-budget/articleshow/87377773.cms||---

Several teachers said the delay would also hamper the academic schedule that had been in disarray over the past year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. JNUEE was conducted by NTA from September 20 to 23 and the interviews were scheduled to be held from October 26 to November 3. But the interview schedule has been withdrawn as the entrance results aren’t out yet. Currently, only interviews under the junior research fellow category are being held. Several teachers have questioned the delay, which has led to the academic schedule being truncated. “There is no academic calendar as of now. While we want to bring the semesters in sync, we will not be able to do so,” JNU professor Ayesha Kidwai said. “I do not understand what the problem is with NTA trying to compile the grading. No new date has been announced. Students will require time to come to the campus. They also need enough time to complete their coursework.” Many teachers said that despite a delayed start, the PG courses were required to be finished within the two-year period, which was leading to students not having six months for a semester. Moushumi Basu, a professor, explained, “The MA batch that was supposed to come in 2020 began classes only in January 2021, and they will complete three semesters by this December. Technically, they won’t even have six months for a semester and everything had to be squeezed in. When we used to conduct the entrances ourselves, we never had a delay.” While JNU officials did not comment, a senior official of NTA said, “We are bunched up right now. There is no particular reason behind the delay and the JNUEE results will be declared soon.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/jnu-cancels-phd-interviews-as-nta-results-not-out-yet/articleshow/87378935.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

According to the Thane railway police, the incident took place late Wednesday night aboard the Mangaluru Express between Mumbai and Thane. Based on the information given by the coach attendant, the Thane railway police said they suspect the involvement of the off-duty coach attendant who was aware of the parcel which contained the valuables. “Few jewellers from Mumbai had hired a courier agent to deliver the jewellery to their clients in Goa and Karwar. The agency, apparently, entrusted the jewellery packet to the AC coach attendant who had left it in the cabinet used for storing linen within the coach. The on-duty attendant registered a complaint suspecting his colleague to have stolen the parcel before alighting at Thane,” said an official from the railway police. The railway police said that they would check footage from closed-circuit television cameras and also check with the employer of the attendant as part of investigations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-rs-13kg-gold-stolen-on-train-off-duty-coach-attendant-is-suspect/articleshow/87378955.cms||Manoj Badgeri

It is the highest increase in the region, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. More than half of the suicides were because of mental illness / insanity. Experts attribute the rise to the Covid pandemic that hindered the movement of people for a long time.As per the NCRB data, 355 suicide cases were registered in Ludhiana in 2020. Of these, 264 were by men and the remaining by women. In 2019, the number of such cases was 254. Therefore, the cases rose by 39.8%, the highest increase since 2015. In 2018, the rise was the second highest at 32% and the lowest at 3.2% in 2016. In 2020, Amritsar recorded 97 suicide cases, Chandigarh 128 and Faridabad 312. The case increase was the highest in Ludhiana in the region, followed by Amritsar (24.4%) and Faridabad (17.7%). Chandigarh witnessed a fall of 2.3% in the cases.An analysis of sub-categories shows that the maximum suicides (215) were due to illness. Of these, 159 were by men and 56 by women. Besides, 190 were due to insanity / mental illness (144 by men and 46 by women).In 2019, the number of suicides due to mental illness / insanity was 103 and 123 in 2018. Seven students (including four boys) had committed suicide due to failure in examination. As many as 31 had ended their lives due to marital issues. Poverty made 13 persons to end their lives. Ten persons committed suicide because of drug abuse / alcoholic addiction.Seven persons had ended their lives because of unemployment and 16 due to property disputes.The health experts say the pandemic was the major reason for the case increase.“Due to the pandemic, there were restrictions on socialization and conflicts rose due to confinement at home, which increased stress of people. As mental ventilation of people, which normally happens when they meet people, didn’t happen, it resulted in mental problems. Youth were the worst sufferers as they didn’t have strong coping mechanism for such a rise in stress during the pandemic,” says psychiatrists Dr Anshu Gupta.Experts say if things normalize, the impact will lessen. “People are advised to meditate, keep themselves busy and pursue hobbies,” he adds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/40-increase-in-suicides-in-city-highest-in-region/articleshow/87369766.cms||Shariq Majeed

Priyanka reached Lalitpur early morning from Lucknow by Sabarmati Express, and after a brief stay in the PWD guest house, went to the Pali village where she met with the family of four farmers, including Ballu Pal, Mahesh, Bhogilal at Ballu’s house. She paid condolences and assured the relatives of the farmers of all help by the Congress party, including repayment of loans and education of the children. Later, talking to the media she said that she is not here for any kind of politics but out of humanity. “Out of four farmers who have recently died in Lalitpur, two committed suicide as they could not get fertiliser while two died standing in queue for procuring fertiliser. One of the farmers was standing for four days in the queue while the other one stood for two days. They had to skip their meals fearing they would lose their number in the line,” Priyanka alleged. She further claimed that the government has totally failed in proper distribution of fertilisers, leading to gross mismanagement. This has resulted in severe black-marketing of fertilisers, which has got siphoned to other states. She further alleged that the government on one hand has raised the price of fertiliser per bag and on the other reduced the quantity. Taking a dig at the Yogi Government on Khiri incident, Priyanka said, “How can you expect justice from a government where farmers are being crushed and the minister whose son is involved is still in the cabinet. How do you expect justice for the farmers?” On her way back, she reached Jhansi where she went to the Jhansi Fort and paid homage to Rani Lakshmibai. Talking to TOI, the Congress leader said, “Our main issues in the UP election will be the atrocities against farmers and women along with surging prices of all commodities, including fuel. With petrol crossing Rs 100/litre and gas cylinder Rs 1,000, how could you expect a common man to lead his daily life. The party is promoting women by giving 40% tickets to them. This will help in raising their issues and make them stronger.” Later, talking to TOI, Rahul Richariya who coordinated Priyanka's trip, said: “Both Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi have always been focussed on Bundelkhand. Hearing a number of deaths for a single reason, she made it a point to visit the place and found tremendous support from the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/poor-distribution-system-has-led-to-fertiliser-fiasco-pgv/articleshow/87378944.cms||---

She was born on November 19, 1828, in Varanasi. The PM is likely to address a limited gathering in the vicinity of the historic Jhansi fort, with the backdrop of the fort contour from where the Rani had jumped on her horse while fighting the British forces. BJP sources said the PM is also scheduled to visit the historic Jhansi fort, where he may pay tributes to Rani Lakshmibai, the torch-bearer of the first war of India’s independence. BJP Jhansi district city president Mukesh Mishra on Friday said, “We have still not got any official communication, but most likely the Prime Minister will be visiting the city on November 19. We are eagerly looking forward to his visit, which will be very important for the region in view of the forthcoming Vidhan Sabha elections.” In absence of any official communication, the administrative officials were reluctant to speak on this matter officially. However, administrative sources revealed that the entire programme is being handled by the ministry of defence for which senior officials from Delhi are frequently visiting the city in this connection. Earlier, the PM had visited Jhansi on February 15, 2019, the next day of the Pulwama attack. He had then laid the foundation stone of Defence Corridor in Jhansi and unveiled various development projects. The PM had said, “Our brave soldiers have sacrificed their lives and these sacrifices will not go in vain as he promised that the perpetrators of Pulwama attack will be punished. Our neighbouring country has forgotten that this is a new India. Pakistan is roaming around with its begging bowl but it’s not getting help from the world.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/pm-may-visit-jhansi-on-nov-19-birth-anniv-of-rani-lakshmibai/articleshow/87378937.cms||---

MahaMetro said it has expedited the work and plans to complete the remaining excavation in the next four months. Two parallel tunnels are being excavated for the up and down lines on the section that travels through Shivajinagar, Civil Court, Kasba Peth, Budhwar Peth, Mandai and ends in Swargate. The 6km stretch between Range Hills and Swargate is underground, taking the total length of excavation of both tunnels to 12km. Two tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) have been pressed into action. The TBMS are excavating from the Swargate-end towards Kasba Peth. MahaMetro officials said the excavation of one tunnel on the entire route of Range Hills to Swargate will be completed by December. “The tunnelling work has been divided into various phases to ensure faster completion. So far, the work is progressing at the expected pace. We are excavating around eight to 10 metres per day,” said Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro. He said the excavation of tunnels between Range Hills and Kasba Peth was completed in the first phase. “Now, tunnelling is underway in the Kasba Peth to Swargate section. One tunnel has progressed beyond Mandai; the TBM is expected to reach the Kasba Peth site in the next two months. Another TBM, which started excavation about two months ago from Swargate, has closed in on the site of Mandai Metro station,” Sonawane said. MahaMetro officials said apart from excavation of the tunnels, which run 18-24 metres underground, its teams were also monitoring buildings located above the ground in a 50-metre radius of the tunnel alignment. “This is to check if the excavation work is impacting the buildings adversely. So far, we have not noticed any,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/mahametro-speeds-up-excavation-aims-to-complete-tunnels-by-feb/articleshow/87376260.cms||Sarang Dastane

The bodies were recovered by search and rescue teams almost nine days after heavy rainfall battered several parts of Uttarakhand, especially in the Kumaon region, on October 18 and 19. The two victims, identified as Mahavir Singh and Bharat Singh, got buried alive in a landslide on October 19. Since then, the personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) had been conducting operations to search the two. Earlier on October 22, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami visited Dungri village and directed authorities to make all possible efforts to search the missing persons. Meanwhile, three people — two trekkers from the Harsil-Chitkul expedition and one porter from the Sunderdhunga glacier expedition — continue to remain missing, according to the SDRF.

---||Agra||Agra lawyers refuse to take up case of Kashmiri students booked for sedition||AGRA: Lawyers’ associations in Agra have refused to provide legal assistance to the three Kashmiri students who were charged with sedition after they allegedly cheered Pakistan’s win against India in a T-20 World Cup match, forcing the families to approach advocates in other cities. Advocate Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, who is fighting the case of 26-year-old PhD scholar Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Mohammad Alam — who were booked for sedition and under UAPA after they were arrested alongside journalist Siddique Kappan while going to meet the family of a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras who was allegedly gangraped and killed — has agreed to defend the students after one of the families contacted him. A family member of one of the students, who reached Agra on Friday, said they sought help from Chaturvedi after they found that lawyers in Agra had refused to take up the case. Talking to TOI, Chaturvedi said, “We will move a bail application for the students in the Agra court soon,” he said. Lawyers, meanwhile, issued a statement that no help will be provided to “those who go against the country”. “These students got admission under the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS) in India to build their careers and they were cheering for the neighbouring country against their nation,” said Nitin Verma, president of Youth Lawyers’ Association (Agra division). President of Agra Advocate Association, Sunil Sharma, said students should have focused on their studies instead of "indulging in anti-national activities". “They are not worthy of getting legal help from us for such an act,” he said. Other associations in the district, including Janpad Bar Association, Lawyers’ Cooperation Committee and Agra Youth Vishal Advocate Association (Collectorate) also said they would not provide legal help to those “involved in anti-national activities.” On Thursday, the students of RBS Engineering Technical Institute had been heckled by BJP youth wing members while they were being taken to the district jail after being produced in court. A few lawyers had also attempted to land punches on them. The students were booked on Wednesday for “promoting enmity, committing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, making statements conducting public mischief” and for cyber terrorism, an offence that could lead to a life sentence. Charges of sedition were added a day later. Meanwhile, the Jammu & Kashmir Students’ Association has prepared a list of colleges across the country where Kashmiri students are “unnecessarily being harassed" and urged the respective state governments to blacklist them. Spokesperson of the association, Nasir Khuehami, said, “We are coordinating with the state governments in Punjab, Karnataka, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where Kashmiri students are presently studying. We have prepared a list of such colleges and the same will be forwarded to the respective state governments for action against those who fail to give the protection and ensure safety of their students.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-lawyers-refuse-to-take-up-case-of-kashmiri-students-booked-for-sedition/articleshow/87376296.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Allahabad||29 Oct Gatta, batasha & khilone losing taste this festive season, demand low||Prayagraj: Rising prices of sugar, coal and unavailability of workers have left the makers of traditional Diwali sweets, like gatta (sweet cubes), batasha (sugar candy sweet) and khilone (sugar toys), in a piquant situation during this festive season. Moreover, the demand for traditional Diwali sweets – sugar toys and sugar candy - has also fallen among buyers forcing makers to restrict the production of traditional Diwali sweetmeats. The edible sugar crafted into animal shapes popularly known as khilone, batasha and gatta have always been an inescapable part of the Diwali festival since decades. In fact, these traditional Diwali sweetmeats are must for devotees while offering prayers to Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi. However, makers of traditional sweetmeats in Sangam city claimed that the demand of traditional Diwali sweets has fallen up to 50 percent in the Prayagraj and adjoining markets. Ankit Sharma, owner of the traditional Diwali sweets making unit, told TOI that rising prices of sugar and coal have hit the production of these mandatory sweetmeats hard. “Since the prices of raw materials used for making traditional sweets has gone up, there was less margin for the manufacturers. Secondly, the strength of buyers was also declining by every passing day,” he added. “Gone are the days when we had to engage six to eight furnaces to meet the demand of khilone, gatta and batasha, but now, they are using two or three furnaces to make the traditional sweets”. Moreover, shortage of coal has also hit the traditional sweet industry hard. Rajiv Sharma, who runs his sweet production unit at Batashamandi area of the city, says “Since the margin for makers has declined, we are too thinking for other options.” He said that apart from rising prices of sugar and coal, the shortage of labourers (workers) has also hit the industry hard. “Now it has become difficult to arrange workers for preparations of sweets as it was very hard work of eight to nine hours to shape and prepare khilone and batasa,” said Rajiv, adding, “we are finding it difficult to arrange labourers in the festive season.” Moreover, the raw materials used for preparation of traditional sweets including lemon salt and other acids have also become expensive. “While lights are the main attraction of Diwali, the wide array of sweets always seem to steal the spotlight at homes during the festive season,” said sweetmeat sellers in the markets “Quintessential festive desserts like ladoo and barfi currently draw the platter of most households, and while they might be associated with prayers and celebrations, but the fact is that none is as significant as heel, batasha, gatta and khilone. However, the sale of these sweetmeats are declining for the past few years,” they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/29-oct-gatta-batasha-khilone-losing-taste-this-festive-season-demand-low/articleshow/87378981.cms||---

New cases were reported from Ram Priya road (1), Old Katra (1), Badi Bagia (1), Dharhariya (1), Chakia (2), ADA Colony Naini (1), Kydganj (1), Chaufatka (1), PAC Dhoomanganj (1), Rajapur (2), Rambagh (1), Jhunsi (1), Jail road (1), Teliyarganj (1), TB Sapru Hospital campus (1), Bhagwatpur (1), Pratappur (1), Handia(1) and Baharia (1). Out of 21 cases, 17 were from the city and rest four from trans Ganga and Yamuna area. Out of 663 cases reported so far, 470 of them were city areas while the rest 193 from rural pockets. District malaria officer (Prayagraj) AK Singh told TOI that there are several basic reasons behind the sudden rise of dengue cases: mosquitoes usually find most favourable temperature (29 or 30 degree Celsius) for breeding and similar temperature currently persists and the recent spell of monsoon had also brought them favourable conditions for breeding. Singh said, “We are now sending at least 120 to 140 samples daily to the microbiology lab for testing and the Elisa test is a must for confirmation of dengue.” The health officials, after witnessing a significant spike in dengue cases in urban areas, have taken up an intensive anti-larva spraying drive in Rajapur, Dhoomanganj, Naini, Kydganj, Chakiya, Old Katra and adjoining areas. Officials appealed to the people in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets to adopt preventive measures to keep the mosquito-borne disease at bay. They asked rural folks to use mosquito nets while sleeping. Anti-larva spraying and fogging were also taken up in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/21-new-dengue-cases-reported-tally-at-663/articleshow/87378969.cms||---

Shantaram Pote, light shop owner, said, “Demand is high for better quality LED string lights. Even though it is more expensive than the cheaper rice lights, it lasts much longer.They also come in a variety of shapes and sizes.” Naresh Choudhary, a decoration and gift shop owner, said, “The Chinaball lights, LED string lights inside round lanterns, are popular among customers this year because it is easy to clean, long lasting and comes in a variety of colours and sizes. But, for outdoor lighting, many customers still prefer rice lights.”  Most of the stock is sourced from Mumbai or Delhi. “I did most of our Diwali shopping online for clothes and such, but for decorations and lights, it is safer and cheaper to go to a shop. I had a bad experience ordering LED string lights online. At the shop, I can check the product before making the purchase,” Mahima Kulkarni, customer at a light shop, said. Lantern-stall owners said that sales are up this year. “Everyone sort of skipped Diwali and all other festivals last year due to the pandemic. This year, as people are celebrating like they used to, sales has been good for Diwali-related businesses like ours. Though we are not getting China-made stock, customers are gladly buying the more sustainable locally-made varieties.” Traders say that it is an overall win for locally made products over Chinese items owing to the lack of stock and a change in the mindset of customers who now demand sustainable varieties. Diwali seems to be even brighter across the city this year as festivities bounce back after being paused last year. Celebrating the overcoming of tough times through the pandemic, Pheonix Marketcity has put up a floral-themed decor signifyinh toughing out winters in harsh climes. “Our entrance is flanked with massive translucent blooming petals embellished with fairy lights representing the transition into better times,” Arun Arora, centre director, Phoenix Marketcity in Vimannagar, said.

He further said that as it is the Centre’s constitutional duty to acquire foodgrains from states, it is unjust to claim that the state government is assisting millers. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/centre-biased-against-south-min/articleshow/87377916.cms||---

Gosavi recently hit the headlines by surfacing as the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) independent witness in the cruise drug bust case involving Aryan Khan. The city police arrested him on Thursday in an alleged Rs3.09 lakh cheating case lodged in 2018. Senior inspector Ashok Kadam told TOI,“The woman running a placement agency in the Camp area came in contact with Gosavi. He was also running a business of helping unemployed people getting jobs in foreign countries on a commission basis.” He said,“The woman subsequently came in contact with the three men from Phursungi, Hadapsar and Solapur in the passport office and lured them by saying that she and Gosavi would help them get jobs in a hotel in Malaysia. The duo collected varying amounts from the men, but failed to offer them jobs. They did not register a complaint instantly because the suspects assured them to repay the money. But the three men never got their money back.” After Gosavi was arrested by the Faraskhana police in the 2018 cheating case, the trio approached the police with their complaint. Another unemployed man filed a complaint application relating to cheating against Gosavi with the Wanowrie police on Friday evening. Police said they would conduct a preliminary inquiry and take a call on registering an FIR.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cantt-police-register-fresh-complaint-against-gosavi-for-duping-trio-in-2020/articleshow/87376310.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Interestingly, crackers named after Rafale fighter jet and several cartoon characters, particularly Ogy are fancyshots -which goes in the air and emits colourful lights with a sound- are hit among shoppers.

Mohd Qair, cracker wholesaler dealer in city told TOI, "This Diwali, loud crackers are out and only green crackers are selling like hot cakes in Sangam city. "From colourful parachute rocket to jhoomar light or from cylinder bomb to flash and back camera phuljhari ,all are in demand," he added. "People are now more passionate about lights with less sound (green crackers) and going with the demand the crackers manufactures were concentrating on green crackers with less sound and pollution," he added further.

---||Agra||3 Kashmiri students in Agra jail to be kept in separate barrack for 'security reasons'||AGRA: Three Kashmiri students who were arrested and booked for sedition for allegedly cheering Pakistan’s win over India in a recent T-20 World Cup match will be shifted to a barrack that is separate from other sections for “security reasons”, jail officials have said. Superintendent of Agra district jail P D Salonia told TOI, “The three inmates will be shifted to a separate barrack, away from other prisoners, for security reasons after we receive their RT-PCR report.” While the inmates — two of whom are aged 20 and the other 21 — kept asking if anyone had come to meet them on Friday, no one did, said the superintendent. TOI found the family members of one of the students were in Agra on Friday. “We wanted to meet our child in jail, but we were scared after watching a video clip in which some people, including lawyers, had attacked them in the presence of police while they were taking them to district jail from the court," a family member of one of the students told TOI. On Thursday, members of the BJP youth wing and a few lawyers had tried to rough up the students outside the court. A video of the incident was also circulated online. It might be a while before the students are able to meet or speak to their families. "To meet them, their kin need to get a verification letter from the district magistrate of their native place. They will need to provide us with the document even to speak with them on the telephone. An RT-PCR report produced in the last 72 hours is also mandatory for anyone coming to meet a prisoner,” said the superintendent. A jail official said the strict requirements were in place because the inmates are from outside the state and have been booked under stringent charges. On Thursday, charges of sedition were added to the FIR lodged against the civil engineering students. They were produced in court and remanded to 14-day judicial custody. TOI had earlier reported that the students belonged to humble backgrounds and were first-generation college-goers. Their families had appealed to the authorities for leniency. The students, too, had sought mercy from UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Earlier, the civil engineering students went through a medical examination by the prison doctor. They have been kept in a temporary barrack. Their vitals were normal and they tested negative for Covid-19 in a rapid antigen test. Their samples have been sent for an RT-PCR test. “They sat together in a corner in the barrack for most of the day, rarely speaking. They didn’t have dinner on Thursday and were up the entire night,” said a jail staffer.

At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia asked Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to make it clear whether he agrees with the appointment, which has “angered” the entire country. Bhatia said the 1984 riots are the “biggest black spot” on Indian democracy. Alleging that the riots were Congress-sponsored violence, he said the party never gave justice to Sikhs and it is the BJP which has been working on it. The opposition has reopened the Sikh community’s old wounds by appointing Tytler to the key body of its Delhi state organisation, he added. “Is this honour for Tytler? Giving him this protection is appropriate on the part of Sonia Gandhi?” he said, noting that all such appointments are approved by the Congress president.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/tytler-as-dpcc-invitee-bjp-targets-congress/articleshow/87379043.cms||---

In Agra, the Agra-Etawah circuit was flagged off. It starts from Taj Nature Walk in Agra and covers the National Chambal Sanctuary in Etawah, an internationally recognized wildlife sanctuary for gharials and includes a lion safari. The aim is to attract nature lovers who visit Agra to primarily see the Taj Mahal. Speaking with TOI, Diwakar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, National Chambal Sanctuary, Agra, said two circuits have been identified for ecotourism in the city. “A dry run of Agra-Etawah was completed on Thursday. Another, which starts from Taj Nature Walk, will cover Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary (Keetham lake), bear rescue centre and elephant rescue and conservation centre in Mathura. It will be covered in the next phase. Besides adding attractions, these circuits will also help in boosting local economy and generating revenue for the government,” he added. Several stakeholders from the tourism industry in Agra visited the circuit with forest department officials after the chief minister flagged off the dry run. Agra-Etawah is one of the nine-odd ecotourism circuits that the state has with considerable potential to attract nature tourists. The journey time will be around one hour and 30 minutes from Agra to Etawah. Srivastava said the department has prepared the brochures of these circuits, which will be sent to the hotels, restaurants, travel and tour companies, for further distribution so that more and more people get to know about these circuits. Rajiv Saxena, vice-chairman of the Tourism Guild Agra who also visited the Agra-Etawah circuit, said, “The lion safari is a unique world class ecotourism opportunity created by the forest department. Its interpretation centre (which provides detailed information about safari’s flora and fauna), multi-animal safari, which includes lion, leopard, antelope, deer and sloth bear, and a cafeteria along with 4D theatre facility offer a class apart experience.” He added that his organization has taken up promotion and marketing of this project to arrest falling overnight stay in Agra among tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/yogi-virtually-launches-agra-etawah-ecotourism-circuit/articleshow/87376381.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Abu Salem’s plea on illegal detention not made out: HC||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday said that a habeas corpus petition filed by extradited gangster Abu Salem, serving life imprisonment for his role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, was not made out as his detention cannot be illegal on being convicted by a court of law. The high court was hearing Salem’s plea seeking to declare his detention in India as illegal and that he be repatriated to Portugal in view of conventions governing the field and the treaty conditions. A habeas corpus petition is filed seeking direction to produce a person who is missing or illegally detained. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani said once a court of law has put Salem on trial and held him guilty, how he could say that the custody is illegal. The bench referred to a Supreme Court judgment and said “even if initially your detention was bad in law, after your conviction by a court of law, your custody does not remain illegal”. “A writ of habeas corpus does not lie in this case. It lied when your custody is illegal but here it is not,” the bench added. When Salem’s counsel informed the court that his appeals against various court orders were pending before the Supreme Court, the bench said when it was pending adjudication, how he could ask for repatriation and added that the relief cannot be granted this way. Advocate S Hari Haran, appearing for Salem, sought to set aside the detention saying the extradition was done on various assurances which have been violated and his custody becomes illegal. He said Salem has been convicted for additional charges which were not part of the treaty. The court listed the matter for November 29, at the request of the counsel to enable him to satisfy the court on the issue of maintainability of the habeas corpus petition. The plea said Salem was extradited in 2002, and has been languishing in jail since, and there is no hope that the pending appeals will be decided anytime soon. On February 25, 2015, the special TADA court had awarded Salem life imprisonment for murdering Mumbai-based builder Pradeep Jain in 1995, along with his driver Mehndi Hassan. On October 27, the Supreme Court had refused bail to Salem in the murder case. pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/abu-salems-plea-on-illegal-detention-not-made-out-hc/articleshow/87379049.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 12 crooks cheated 3,000 of Rs 1.7 crore by posing as govt redressal dept’s officials, arrested||NEW DELHI: The newly formed strategic fusion & strategic ops (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police’s Special Cell has busted a group duping individuals in the guise of the government's redressal departments. According to DCP KPS Malhotra, 12 people, including two women, have been arrested. “Around 3,000 individuals were cheated by the group. The analysis of bank details shows they defrauded people of at least Rs 1.7 crore in the last one year. Seven laptops, 25 mobile phones, one Ertiga car and Rs 52,500 in cash were recovered,” disclosed Malhotra. Basically, posing as government officials running an online complaint redressal system, the group members created several websites that were pushed on Google search lists through search engine optimisation. Police said that the crooks charged the victims processing fees and other money for speedy investigation but later stopped responding to them. Their target was individuals who were cheated and were trying to have their grievances addressed. Such individuals, in trying to lodge a formal complaint, ended up using the web pages that Google indicated to them for the purpose. The cops had received a complaint at IFSO from a person who reported that when he was trying to file a complaint about an incident of cheating, he came across the www.jansurkashakendara.in site that claimed to be a crime reporting portal. He called the mobile phone number provided on the website and was informed the site was authorised to work with the government and that it would lodge his FIR regarding the fraud. The complainant said he was charged Rs 2,850 by the site to file his complaint. But once the payment was finalised, he found his phone number blocked. A team comprising ACP Raman Lamba and inspectors Manoj and Vijender began pursuing the case. DCP Malhotra said, “During analysis of the technical data of the website and the payments gateway, it became clear that several innocent people had been cheated by the gang. Soon, seven other similar complaints were found registered on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. One FIR was also found registered in Karnataka. Bank account details of the payment gateways were collected and analysed.” Based on technical and human intelligence, a dozen people were taken into custody, most of them in their mid-twenties. They confessed to creating several websites with names resembling government sites. These included Jan Shikayat Kendra, Grahak Suraksha Kendra, Nyaya Bharat and some others, according to the probe. When the victims called on the phone numbers given on these websites, the accused posed as government officials. They charged money from the victims ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 30,000 for lodging and enquiring their complaint. “Delhi Police appeals to the public to be vigilant while making search transactions,” Malhotra said. “Whenever anybody is a victim of cybercrime, he/she should only report the same on the government portal for reporting cybercrime, that is www.cybercrime.gov.in, and call the helpline number 155260. No government office charges any processing fee for putting the government machinery into action.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/12-crooks-cheated-3000-of-rs-1-7cr-by-posing-as-govt-redressal-depts-officials-arrested/articleshow/87379064.cms||---

The home department on Friday issued her suspension order, following a report sent by the ACB to Mumbai police. The report was first sent to the DGP, who forwarded it to the home department, since Patil is an officer of the class one rank. As per the suspension order, she will receive her salary. Patil has been in the news earlier as well, for better reasons. She has been appreciated for practising fasts during the holy month of Ramzan every year. But she has courted controversy too, in the past, for her poem condemning the vandals of Amar Jawan Jyoti Memorial during the Azad Maidan riots in 2012. The poem was criticised for allegedly fanning communalism. She was recently promoted to the post of ACP in the Meghwadi division. The complainant in the bribery case owns a 220 sq ft gala in Jogeshwari. Patil had allegedly demanded Rs 1 lakh from him to take action against trespassers on his property.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-tainted-acp-sujata-patil-suspended-from-force/articleshow/87379068.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Eknath Shinde gets death threats from Naxals||THANE: Maharashtra cabinet minister Eknath Shinde has reportedly received death threats from Naxalites. The police said that Shinde received the threats in a letter around a fortnight ago and, accordingly, an offence was registered against unidentified persons under IPC section 506 (2) (criminal intimation) at Wagle estate police station in Thane. Shinde, who heads the urban development ministry, is a senior Sena leader from Thane. He is the guardian minister for Thane and Gadchiroli districts. A senior police officer at the Thane Police commissionerate said that the death threats have been issued by some unidentified persons who claim to be from the Naxal-infested Gadchiroli district. The letter warns the minister that he and his entire family would be eliminated. The threats are a warning to Shinde over his attempts to wipe out Naxal influence by bringing in reforms in Gadchiroli. The investigation has been handed over to the anti-extortion cell of Thane police, and sources said that a team has been formed to crack the case. Sources added that the team has already visited Gadchiroli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/maharashtra-min-eknath-shinde-gets-death-threats-from-naxals/articleshow/87379084.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Delhi||DU EC clears criteria for screening of assistant profs||New Delhi: Delhi University’s executive council on Friday passed the criteria for the screening process for appointment of assistant professor, amid opposition. The elected members dissented inside the meeting, while Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) protested outside the meeting venue. Along with this, the EC also adopted the recommendation of the committee constituted to look into the de-affiliation of the College of Art (COA). The committee has recommended rejecting the Delhi government’s decision to bring COA under Ambedkar University. There was opposition to the screening process as it was putting a cap on the number of candidates who would be called for interviews. DUTA had pointed out that this would deprive a large number of currently serving ad hoc teachers to even face the selection committees. The proposed recommendations had stated that the number of shortlisted candidates who will be called for interviews in the university department shall be restricted. As per the agenda, for university departments, a minimum of 30 candidates for the first vacancy and 10 candidates for every additional vacancy shall be called. The capping on colleges was, however, removed by the administration after teachers’ bodies raised concerns. Ashok Agarwal, elected court member of the EC, said, “The six elected members protested the agenda on the screening process, but it was still passed.” Various teachers’ bodies argued that this was in violation of a record of discussion dated December 5, 2019. According to the said letter, “Faculty appointed and working on ad-hoc, temporary or contract basis and meeting the eligibility criteria shall be shortlisted for interview in the respective university and/or its colleges.” On Friday, issuing a statement, DUTA president Rajib Ray, said, “DUTA had ensured that all serving ad hoc teachers would be called for the interviews through the December 5 Record of Discussions with the MoE in 2019 after a historic movement and will not tolerate any violation of the same.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/du-ec-clears-criteria-for-screening-of-assistant-profs/articleshow/87379073.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shankracharya reached Gorakhpur on a two-day visit on Friday. While talking reporters here, he said, India will become a Hindu rashtra in 3.5 years. “We have a strategy (vyuh rachna) for this and support of all of you is required for that,” said Shankaracharya. “Hind Mahasagar and Hindukoot are two ancient words and Hindu has Hi and Indu which means Himalaya and sarovar (lake) which means that India is spread from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.” He further claimed that political leaders are not aware of the definition of politics, “There is no dearth of political leaders but they are not acquainted with the definition. Politics is about creating a well cultured, well organized, safe and wealthy individual and society and not a game of greed and craze.” “The policy which is best is politics. And when anyone neglects responsibilities and becomes a consumer of the post, he leads towards downfall. It applies to all,” he added. On being asked whether Muslim women should be stopped from entering the temples, he said, “Any person of any faith or caste could visit temples and there are rules and prohibitions which applies to all. Most of the prohibitions are for the Shankracharyas and we follow them.” Everyone should visit temples for darshan of deities within limitations, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/india-will-be-a-hindu-rashtra-in-3-5-years-shankaracharya-swami-nishchalanand/articleshow/87378009.cms||---

The crafty strategist held a meeting with in-charge and conveners of assembly constituencies and gave them a target of victory in at least 300 seats. The meeting, which was kept off media glare, saw Shah taking a ground-level feedback on the prevailing situation and performance of incumbent MLAs, sources said. During his address, Shah provided mantras to party functionaries, many of whom were recent entrants, to win over maximum number of people. He is learnt to have asked party workers not to be aggressive in seeking tickets. The meeting was also attended by top BJP leaders, including Union minister and BJP’s UP election in charge Dharmendra Pradhan, BJP vice-president Radha Mohan Singh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. The exercise assumed significance amid BJP’s plans to bench a significant number of MLAs to counter possible anti-incumbency. This is also seen as a move to stymie the opposition which has been seeking to regain its political strength to arrest the saffron party’s electoral juggernaut in 2022 state polls. Shah also met a host of former MPs and MLAs from various constituencies and sought their “support” and “experience” to help the party get an advantage over political rivals. A senior party leader privy to the meeting said, the exercise was also part of a stock-taking exercise in different constituencies before the party high command rolls out a final poll blueprint. The home minister subsequently held a meeting with the party brass at the state headquarters and discussed the electoral strategy,.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/shah-takes-ground-feedback-gives-target-of-300-seats-to-bjp-functionaries/articleshow/87379078.cms||Pankaj Shah

As many as 25 proposals — mostly related to roads — were submitted by the civic administration. Bhoyar said the panel gave administrative approval to works worth Rs11.62 crore. Besides, the panel also gave tender approval to various works worth Rs10.42 crore, he said. Bhoyar reviewed the NMC’s seven-month income and expressed satisfaction over earnings by various departments including property tax, water works, advertisement and town planning departments. He said the property tax department has generated Rs17 crore more revenue as compared to the last fiscal. Similarly, the town planning department too has performed well this year as compared to the last financial year. This year so far, the NMC has generated Rs111.42 crore, while last year it was only Rs10 crore. Bhoyar expressed anguish over poor recovery by the estate department.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Fight over fish curry ends in murder||RAJKOT: A petty altercation over food between friends snowballed into a gruesome murder of a 32-year-old man who was crushed under the car on the bank of a river in Morbi district by a bootlegger. The victim Ranjit Kunvariya died on the spot while the accused Sunil Koradiya is on the run. The incident happened in Maliya Miyana taluka’s Venasar village on Thursday afternoon. Ranjit, his cousin Ashok, Sunil and Prakash Loladiya had organized a party on the banks of Khoddhroi river that flows on the village’s outskirts. They reached there in their vehicles with utensils and rice. After some time, they went fishing in the river and cooked fish curry and rice. However, the fish catch was large so Sunil called his brother Sandeep to join the party. According to the complainant, Ashok Kunvariya, when the party was going on and everybody was relishing the food, Sandeep asked for more fish. However, Ranjit refused to serve him more saying that they had done all the hard work of fishing and cooking while he was not there to help. Sandeep’s brother Sunil got furious over this attitude and accused Ranjit of finding excuses to start a quarrel. This led to an altercation between them. Sunil suddenly left from there and sat in his car. While everyone thought he was leaving, he sped the car and crushed Ranjit under its wheels. Ranjit died on the spot while Prakash who was standing beside him also suffered grievous injuries. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sunil left the car there and ran away into nearby bushes. But other friends caught hold of Sandeep and thrashed him. He got severely injured and was shifted to Rajkot Civil Hospital for treatment.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh will quarantine BJP in assembly elections: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Accusing the ruling BJP of spreading falsehood over opposition’s role in relief work during the pandemic, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said people of the state will quarantine the BJP in the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Responding to a media query over Union home minister Amit Shah’s charge that the opposition was missing from action during the pandemic, Akhilesh said his party reached out to the needy and party workers were engaged in relief work at all levels right from arranging oxygen cylinders and medicines for the needy to distribution of food packets and clothing to migrant labourers. “We reached out to people to contribute in every way possible. But people have not forgotten how dead bodies were seen floating in rivers in Prayagraj, Varanasi, Unnao and Kannauj. People have not forgotten how they had to wait in queue to cremate their loved ones who died for want of oxygen and adequate health care. But instead of providing relief to the people, the ruling BJP got cremation grounds covered from all sides so that no one could see how many bodies were being cremated,” he said. The former UP CM said people have not forgotten the pain and agony that they had to go through during the pandemic. “People of UP will quarantine the BJP in the 2022 polls,” he said. Responding to another media query of Amit Shah’s appreciation of the Yogi government’s functioning, Akhilesh said, “Has the farmers’ income been doubled as promised? Look at the quality of construction of the Purvanchal Expressway. What happened to the big companies which were to invest in UP? Where are the jobs the BJP promised for the youth?" The SP national president also accused the BJP of having copied his campaign anthem of 2017 elections, titled “Kaam bolta hai”. “The BJP has released a song. Play it after Kam Bolta Hai and see it yourself if it’s a copy or not,” Akhilesh said, adding that till now the ruling BJP only indulged in inaugurating projects started by the SP government. Now they have gone even further and copied his song as well. Akhilesh was interacting with the media at an event at SP headquarters after former Congress MP Harendra Malik and his son and former MLA Pankaj Malik joined the Samajwadi Party. Both the leaders had resigned from the Congress last week, alleging that the Congress had become directionless.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/akhilesh-up-will-quarantine-bjp-in-assembly-elections/articleshow/87379091.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Investigating officials said that the camera didn’t have any memory card but they have sent it for FSL tests. If recovered, the spy camera’s data may unravel a lot of mysteries about the rape case that was filed by a 24-year-old law student in the city. The woman, a student of a private university, has accused chartered accountant Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt of raping her. “The spy camera installed at the girl’s flat didn’t have a memory card. The photos and videos of the girl and the accused were probably taken from the mobile phone that was connected to the camera,” said a police official. “We have recovered the mobile phones of Jain and Bhatt and sent them for FSL tests. If the phones had any photographs that were deleted, all will be recovered,” the police added. Sources in the police department said that the videos and photos captured by the spy camera include that of another prominent citizen whose name hasn’t surfaced in the case yet. The girl has alleged that Jain, at whose CA firm she was undergoing training, spiked her drink and molested her some months ago. He later visited her residence again and raped her. Bhatt too has been accused of raping the girl and threatening her of dire consequences. She later told the police that Jain had installed a spy camera at her flat. The cops had also arrested Kanji Mokariya for allegedly helping Bhatt in escaping the city. He has been granted bail by a local court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/spy-camera-memory-card-remains-a-mystery/articleshow/87377619.cms||---

After stealing cash, the burglars torched the machine and the ATM booth. Along with the ATM, fixture, AC and CCTV cameras were destroyed in the fire, police said. Police were informed about the theft at around 8am. The theft is suspected to have been carried out between 12 midnight to 4 am. The ATM was cut open using a gas cutter. There was no security guard employed at the ATM and none in the area came to know about the incident till the personnel of the agency managing the ATM went to check it. Following doubt of suspicious activities, those remotely monitoring the security of the ATM alerted their local official. As the officials went to check they found the ATM booth engulfed in fire. Bhupendra Singh, an employee of the firm that maintains ATMs of SBI, lodged the complaint at the Pandesara police station. The ATM was installed in a shop of a commercial complex in Vadod. Cops said that the burglars sprayed paint on the CCTV cameras installed inside the booth before breaking open the ATM. Police suspect that it must have taken over an hour for the burglars to break the ATM. “We will check the CCTV footage of the cameras installed in the area to find out how many persons were involved and the vehicle used by them,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/burglars-set-atm-kiosk-on-fire-after-stealing-rs-31-lakh/articleshow/87377842.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Supply of essentials affected in higher Himalayan villages||PITHORAGARH: Residents of nearly 21 villages in the higher reaches of the Himalayas have been struggling to procure daily supplies for nearly 10 days now. These villages were cut off from the Pithoragarh district headquarter after rain-triggered incidents blocked several roads. In most of these villages, daily supplies are transported from Dharchula. Between October 18 and 20, the district recorded 300 mm rainfall. Following this, crucial road stretches, including those along the India-China and India-Nepal border in areas like Tawaghat to Tedang in Darma, Chaudas in Dharchula and Munsyari to Milam, were blocked at several spots, according to the data collated from the district disaster management office. Besides, the population in the majority of these villages is migratory and people usually move to lower valleys with their livestock after Diwali. So, if the roads are not restored by then, these people may have to suffer extreme weather conditions. Meanwhile, residents of Milam village, the last village of Munsyari tehsil along the China border, have been facing difficulties as a crucial bridge at Samgad on the Milam–Dung route was washed away in the rainfall. Milam villagers regularly come to Dung, where the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has an outpost, to secure daily supplies. Indian Army and central police personnel use several of these roads. A district disaster management official said, “Efforts are underway to open up all the blocked roads soon. The district administration has also ordered the repair of the bridge on the Milam–Dung route.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/supply-of-essentials-affected-in-higher-himalayan-villages-as-rain-related-instances-block-roads-in-pithoragarh/articleshow/87376442.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Mumbai||Staff unpaid for four years, HC gets tough with Solapur civic body||MUMBAI: Observing that the “state of affairs is quite shocking”, Bombay high court on Thursday directed Solapur municipal corporation to deposit Rs 8 crore in court or pay entire arrears of salaries of around 300 transport undertaking employees since November 2017, within a week and till payment is made to “stop expenditure on all activities” including “salaries of its superior officers” and payment of contractors. The HC’s hard-hitting directions were in a civil contempt petition by employees who said the civic body flouted two orders and since 2017 had not paid their salaries. Expressing surprise at employees not being paid any salary for the last four years, Justice Kulkarni said, “It is difficult to believe that a public body like a municipal corporation can exploit their employees to such an extent by not paying them their salaries without caring for their livelihood... It is precarious to imagine such a situation in a civilised society and that too at the hands of a public body.’’ The workers’ fundamental right of livelihood is being directly impacted by “such callous acts”, said the HC, adding that “non-payment of salaries to the employees” and their suffering is “solely attributable to the total mismanagement of the municipal corporation”. “Paucity of funds and that too for such a large municipal corporation can be no reason for non-payment of the salaries of these employees,” it stressed. Deprecating such “default”, the HC directed that till it first pay them their dues, Solapur Municipal Corporation cannot spend on anything else “expenses relating to essential civic amenities”. “It is specifically directed that all works of road, buildings and payments of contractors and, for that purpose, even salaries of superior officers of the corporation including their TA/DAs and other office expenses of the councillors shall not be released till further orders from the court,” directed Justice Kulkarni. The order was made available on Friday. The judge, however, made it clear that his order will “not come into operation if arrears of salary are paid to the concerned employees”. Justice Kulkarni directed the state to act under law against such civic bodies which “defaults in its duties”. The general secretary, Lal Bavta Mahanagar Palika, Solapur, had filed the contempt petition this year against P Shivshankar, commissioner, Solapur Municipal Corporation, and others. For the employees, senior counsel Gayatri Singh said there were two orders, one of December 2017, passed by the Industrial Court at Solapur, directing the corporation to pay salary arrears, after observing that it has “prima facie engaged in unfair labour practices”. She said the HC had in 2018 confirmed the Industrial Court order, saying the transport corporation is “very much part of the corporation” and dismissed a challenge raised by the civic body which disputed that it was their employer. The HC said, “Petitioners/concerned employees are employed by Solapur Municipal Corporation...This petition concerns about 300 employees.’’ The HC posted the matter to November 15.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-staff-unpaid-for-4-yrs-hc-gets-tough-with-solapur-civic-body/articleshow/87379094.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||SAD constitutions: Hoshiarpur court summons Badal sr||HOSHIARPUR: A Hoshiarpur court has summoned Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patron Parkash Singh Badal to appear on November 28 in the case of allegedly committing forgery while amending and submitting constitution of the party to statutory authorities. Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and secretary Daljit Singh Cheema have already secured bail in the case. The case was pending for Friday and Sukhbir had applied for exemption which was permitted by the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) Rupinder Singh. However, the court ordered that Badal senior be summoned on November 28. The criminal complaint against Badals and Cheema was filed by Hoshiarpur-based activist Balwant Singh Khera. They were originally summoned in the case by the court of ACJM on November 4, 2019 but later Cheema had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking quashing of the case. However, on August 27 last, the high court dismissed the petition and asked them to appear in lower court, while holding Badal senior’s presence should not be insisted as he is a nonagenarian. Subsequently additional district and sessions judge J P S Khurmi on September 2 had ordered Sukhbir to surrender before the trial court on or before September 13 to get bail. However, ACJM Rupinder Singh, trial court in this case, had already fixed the case for September 8, and Sukhbir appeared in the court on that day and furnished bail bond of Rs 1 lakh. The criminal complaint was filed in February 2009 on the ground that SAD had two types of constitutions — one submitted by the party with the Gurudwara Election Commission (before 2004 election of SGPC) and the other before the Election Commission of India. “The case is primarily of preparing false documents and then using them in in order to cheat the authorities and innocent citizens. It is a case of impeccable documentary evidence,” said Khera’s counsel Hitesh Puri. The criminal case was filed against Badal senior and junior, then party secretary general Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, secretary Daljit Singh Cheema and party’s district Hoshiarpur president alleging that the leaders committed a serious crime and they were liable to be prosecuted as provided by law under sections 465, 466, 467, 468 and 471 of IPC. However, the court had summoned the Badals and Cheema.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sad-constitutions-hoshiarpur-court-summons-badal-sr/articleshow/87378056.cms||IP Singh
---||Lucknow||Shah lays talks on next CM to rest, sets tone & tenor of poll campaign||Lucknow: The much-awaited visit of Union home minister Amit Shah to Uttar Pradesh has set the ball rolling for BJP’s poll campaign in the state. Months ahead of the assembly elections, Shah’s address has set the narrative for the BJP leaders to follow. One of the biggest takeaways of Shah’s speech on Friday is that the speculation around the name of the next CM candidate has been put to rest, for now at least, as no word is the last word in politics. Amid the murmurs among a section of BJP leaders that the BJP might not name Yogi Adityanath as CM after 2022 assembly polls, Shah categorically said, “For the success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, formation of the Yogi Adityanath government in 2022 is a must.” The statement will be enough to silence Yogi’s detractors. A senior BJP leader, however, said Shah’s statement should not be taken as the final word as one day is enough to change the course of politics. Shah’s speech also hinted at the BJP’s intentions and the political discourse that is set to unfold in the near future. Shah sharpened attack on the Samajwadi Party and its chief Akhilesh Yadav while remaining silent on other major players like the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress. His silence on Congress and its general secretary and UP in charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has actually come as a surprise to many as she had been hogging all the limelight among opposition leaders for the last one month, be it during Lakhimpur Kheri violence or Agra incident. According to political analysts, BJP leaders are clear that the party is heading for a direct showdown with the SP, more than any other party. This clarity came after BJP reportedly got a few surveys done to assess the situation. Reports have also been doing the rounds that the party might not repeat at least 100 of its MLAs in the 2022 elections. Amit Shah knows the situation best as he has worked in Uttar Pradesh as the in charge during 2014 Lok Sabha election. Experts believe that the attack on Congress by a leader like Amit Shah could have changed the narrative leading the BJP nowhere. However, this would not be the case with the SP as attacks and counter-attacks between the two parties might lead to polarisation of votes as Muslims have remained loyal to the SP at least until 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Shah’s silence on the Bahujan Samaj Party would only add to the worries of Mayawati and BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, who have been trying hard to prove that the allegations of it being the BJP’s ‘B team’ are falsely levelled by the opposition parties. However, from the BJP’s point of view, attacking the BSP could alienate Dalit voters at a time when the BJP is making efforts to dent Mayawati’s Dalit votebank.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/shah-lays-talks-on-next-cm-to-rest-sets-tone-tenor-of-poll-campaign/articleshow/87379097.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Mumbai||What should Mumbai’s climate action plan do? Mitigate and adapt||As climate talks kick off in Glasgow, TOI asks 4 experts what they’d like to see Mumbai—which is ‘always in the build mode’—do for its natural environment while balancing infra needs: ‘Temporary barriers to water are important’ Pushpendra Johri | risk analyst and sr vice-president, rmsi I’d like to see an inundation forecasting system tied into a decision system, and along with that a set of mitigation options. I am also a staunch supporter of temporary solutions that can help people in Mumbai evade some of the problems they face every time it rains. There are many options that could be put into action in a short span of time. We used to have sandbags, nowadays we have inflatable water bags: They inflate with flood water, and once fully filled, they form a bulwark against the water too. They aren’t aesthetic but you can make them gel with buildings. You can easily stop 2-3 feet of water if you can put such bags in some places and keep your road network clear. Climate change is happening and nothing we can do locally will change that till at least 2050; we have to mitigate and adapt. ‘Coastal infra, green spaces, need upgradeRakesh Kumar | former director, neeri As a coastal city, Mumbai has to worry about inundation. All the infrastructure in the 100-200 metres area near the coastline will need to be retrofitted to deal with issues like salt-water invasion—which can make foundations weaker— and, in the case of storm water drains, potential flooding even in non-monsoon time. We also need to look at improving green spaces near the coastline, whether mangroves or rocky areas. We are seeing a lot of siltation in the creeks that is reducing the capacity of the waterways to hold and flush out water. In the longer term, we need to augment the health infrastructure to deal with climate change-related diseases, and not only for Mumbai but the whole of the metropolitan region. ‘Implementation on the ground is what matters’Rashneh Pardiwala | director, centre of environmental research and education Many policies seem brilliant on paper— like the state climate action report from TERI— but implementation is what matters. I hope it won’t be business as usual on the ground. If you look at the energy sector, for instance, there are high renewable energy targets. But GST on renewables was hiked in October from 5% to 12%. Grand declarations are fine but what is the ground reality? We need to get down to the nitty gritty details. Mumbai is always going to be in build mode, the question is how green can we make the building of infrastructure? What materials are we using? How many trees are we felling? There are lots of clearances for tree felling for infrastructure projects with compensatory tree plantation. But the principle should be to first conserve what we have. ‘Solutions must be inclusive of urban poor’Roshni Nugehalli | director, social justice group yuva I’d like to see a strong focus on justice. The action plan should not only focus on environmental concerns and technological solutions but also help the lives of the urban poor. Too often we find that the urban poor, who are not responsible for climate emissions, are the most affected by infrastructure projects and climate change impacts. People who live in slums make a huge contribution to the city, and their rights and needs must be considered in policy responses. It includes improving water and sanitation as well as the conditions of their living and transport. They should not be looked at as a problem but be included in any solution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/what-should-mumbais-climate-action-plan-do-mitigate-adapt/articleshow/87379099.cms||---

---||Mumbai||At COP26, opportunity for India to change climate narrative: Aaditya||The Maharashtra government in association with TEDxGateway will host ‘TEDxGateway Countdown 2021’ on Sunday as international climate talks kick off in Glasgow. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, a co-curator of the event, talks to TOI about efforts to combat climate change. Excerpts: Q: What are your expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP26 climate meet? A: India has an opportunity to change the narrative and show the world that we are acting aggressively on climate. I hope India can step up its climate ambition, just as Maharashtra has done. However, to be able to take any aggressive action, we need financial resources. This means we need to look to the global North to mobilize finance. Only 15% of investments in ‘green finance’ are currently from international sources. Q: The UN has emphasised protection of trees. How soon can the citizens expect implementation of the amended state tree Act? A: The amendment of the tree Act is a unique step by our environment department to ensure that urbanisation does not go unchecked. The state government is determined to implement a scientific approach to conservation. To ensure this, the tree authorities will have ‘tree experts’ empanelled. We are currently in the process of vetting these experts. As soon as we select them, the state tree authority will be activated and will start taking up cases. Q: How do you plan to prevent large-scale tree felling in public projects? A: In just under two years, we have managed to bring over 9,800 hectares of mangroves under statutory protection and saved 808 acres of Aarey forest—Mumbai’s green lungs. In addition, Mumbai is also a signatory to the World Resources Institute’s Cities4Forests initiative and the C40 Cities Urban Nature Declaration. Through these international initiatives, the city is taking its local climate action to the global level. Q: The state has been reeling under extreme weather events. What are the government's plans on climate adaptation and mitigation? A: Majhi Vasundhara, our climate change mitigation and adaptation programme, incentivises local bodies to take climate actions, including improvements in green cover, waste management, air quality monitoring, as well as promoting electric vehicles, conserving water, and promoting renewable energy. In just one year, we were able to achieve a significant impact. This programme not only pushes our local bodies to act on climate, but also serves as a monitoring framework. Q: Maharashtra has to have a strategy to move to electric transport. But how will the state meet the need for charging infrastructure? A: The electric vehicle transition is incomplete without provision of adequate charging infrastructure. While we are focusing on transitioning public and private fleets to electricity, our policy also includes provisions for promoting charging infrastructure in urban agglomerations and key highways. Our policy mandates cities at least one public charging station in a 3km x 3km grid or a minimum of 50 charging stations per million population, whichever is higher. We have also mandated the setup of public charging stations at a 25km distance on both sides of the highways.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-cop26-opportunity-for-india-to-change-climate-narrative-aaditya/articleshow/87379121.cms||Manka Behl

---||Chandigarh||Dutch national granted bail in money laundering case||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted bail to an India-origin Dutch national Shiv Lal Pabbi, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in July this year in connection with a money-laundering probe initiated against him on the request of the Netherlands government. “There was no request on behalf of the Netherlands authorities to register a case under Section 44/45 or 65 of the PMLA as at the first instance, a mutual legal assistance was called in 2017 and it is not the case of the ED that by way of any further correspondence, it was communicated to corresponding authorities in Netherlands that the petitioner, who is a Dutch national, is being prosecuted in India, for which he has already been convicted by the courts at Netherlands,” the HC has observed while granting bail to Pabbi. While granting bail, Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan has made it clear that the passport of the petitioner will remain in the custody of the prosecuting agency or the trial court and the petitioner will not leave India without prior permission of the HC. Pabbi was booked on September 7, 2020, by the ED on the grounds that a letter dated December 29, 2017, was received from the ministry of home affairs, vide which the original letter dated April 20, 2017, sent by the embassy of Netherlands, was endorsed. A request was made for legal assistance in the matter of Pabbi and others for their involvement in money laundering as they indulged in secret banking and had assets in Dubai and India. The letter further states that the offence registered by the Dutch Police corresponds to sections 420 and 467 of the IPC, which are scheduled offences under Part “A” of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. During investigation, it was found that the petitioner is involved in cheating and forgery in the Netherlands by transferring money of other persons through hawala operations and earning commissions. He was apprehended by the officials of bureau of immigration at the New Delhi airport following a lookout circular (LOC) dated February 19, 2021, when he was to board a flight out of India. He was produced before the special judge, CBI, Punjab, and sent to judicial custody. While seeking bail, Pabbi’s counsel Vikram Chaudhari argued that he had not committed any scheduled offence in India. It was also argued that the petitioner had appeared before the ED on two-three occasions in July (6 to 9) 2021 and 13 documents, including his ITR/salary, were called from him. As the same were in the Netherlands, the petitioner sought time. In the meantime, he received summons from the Netherlands authorities and booked a return flight to attend the said proceedings and to bring the documents required by the ED. Chaudhari submitted that the petitioner was unaware about the issuance of LOC as the same was intentionally not brought to the notice of the writ court by the respondent-authorities, when the writ petition was pending. Opposing the bail plea, the ED counsel argued that there was every possibility that Pabbi may flee from country as he is a Dutch national and may also try to tamper with the evidence. Representing the Union government, additional solicitor general of India, Satya Pal Jain argued that the petitioner has earned huge amount in cash by way of underground bank/hawala business in the Netherlands and that he, in conspiracy with co-accused Mukesh Sharma, has prepared certain documents, which amounts to tax evasion, forgery, cheating and money laundering as no permission was taken by him in Netherlands. After hearing all the parties, the HC ordered to release the petitioner on bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/dutch-national-granted-bail-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/87378075.cms||Ajay Sura

The group have also approached the police with a complaint seeking to probe into the disappearance of strays from the centre, which they suspect to be owing to culling to reduce the workload.

Overcrowded dog shelters, carcasses found buried on the premises and conspicuous disappearances of stray dogs brought for sterilisation are some of the accusations against the centre. The complainants, who are some young people who regularly feed strays on streets, said they noticed the inhumane practices when they visited the ABC centre several times during the past week. They alleged that strays brought to the centre are forced to cram inside small cages. Instead of cooked food, they are being fed pet food that is harmful to the strays. On Thursday, the young activists even found a fresh carcass of a dog buried on the premises of the centre following which they approached the Kovalam police and filed a complaint. Kovalam station house officer inspector Praiju said though they have not registered a case, the police did have a word with the doctors concerned at the ABC centre as part of an enquiry. “We have not registered a case because prima facie there is no evidence to prove any deliberate act of atrocity towards animals,'' the inspector said. The doctors apparently told the police that the strays are forced to remain under deplorable conditions owing to the lack of sufficient infrastructure. Regarding the fresh carcass unearthed on the centre's premises, the doctors said not all dogs brought to the centre are healthy. Some may not survive the surgery procedure. The average fatality rate is 10%. The corporation officials too did not dismiss the complaints of the animal lovers. Jameela Sreedharan, chairperson, standing committee (health), said measures are being taken to improve the infrastructure facilities at the centre. “Currently we have just two doctors and two surgery tables. On an average 10 dogs are brought to the centre daily,” she said.  However, she said that the corporation would soon be implementing a Rs 4.9 crore project aimed at improving the infrastructure as well as the workforce at the centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/abc-centre-accused-of-cruelty-towards-strays/articleshow/87345339.cms||---

---||Nashik||Chef was eyeing to set up luxury resort, say police||Nashik: Investigation has revealed that the chef based in Washington, who allegedly killed a mentally-challenged man using a poisonous snake and tried to pass it off as his own death in a bid to claim USD 5 million in insurance, wanted to invest the insurance claim to set up a swanky tourist resort at Bhandardara and also buy agricultural land for farming in Ahmednagar, said sub divisional police officer (SDPO) of Sangamner, Rahul Madane. The Ahmednagar police had arrested the chef, Prabhakar Waghchaure, along with four of his associates, on October 25 for the killing. His plans went awry after a police probe found out that he is alive. “During interrogation, Prabhakar told us that he wanted to use the insurance claim money to set up a plush resort near Bhandardara, which is a popular hill station in Ahmednagar. He had even started scouting land for this project in that location,” Madane told TOI. Madane claimed that Prabhakar also wanted to start commercial farming in Aloke and had even identified a plot of land. “In fact, he had already paid an advance of Rs 54 lakh to the owner for buying that piece of land,” added Madane. Prabhakar, whose in-laws hail from Akole taluka, had travelled to the United States in 1996 and worked as a chef for about 10 years at Washington DC. Later, he took a restaurant on lease and operated it. He returned back to Mumbai in January this year and later came to stay in Akole. “Prabhakar told us that he did not want to return to Washington DC and hence, did not renew his US visa, which was due in April this year. His plan was that he and his wife would run the two commercial ventures in Ahmednagar, while his two sons would remain in the US,” Madane added. Prabhakar and his four associates were produced in the local court on Friday as their police remand ended. The court sent them to judicial custody. Ahmednagar superintendent of police Manoj Patil said he has directed the local police to investigate if Prabhakar was involved in any other fraud. “The police are pursuing the case extremely closely,” added Patil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/chef-was-eyeing-to-set-up-luxury-resort-say-police/articleshow/87373797.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Dehradun||Ahead of Diwali, Corbett staff on alert mode||DEHRADUN: Ahead of Diwali, the forest department has sounded a red alert to prevent poaching of animals, especially owls, in the Corbett Tiger Reserve. “To prevent poaching of animals, we have issued a red alert in the region. Our teams will be patrolling the area more frequently. In addition, leaves of any forest personnel have been cancelled till November 10 to ensure enough boots on the ground,” said Rahul, director, CTR. Incidents of owl poaching increase during Diwali due to superstition. Some even use the remains of the bird for black magic. The bird is poached for its bones, claws, skulls, feathers, meat and blood. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has identified Uttarakhand as a growing hotbed of illegal owl trade. While officials at CTR do not have exact figures for the number of owls in the area, they estimate that nearly 10 species of the bird are present there. Environmentalists believe that in the past few years awareness about anti-poaching has helped in curbing the practice. “Locals also remain on the lookout for any potential poaching incidents. The red alert also helps with better monitoring of the situation,” said Anup Sah, a wildlife photographer. Several owl species have been put on the threatened (or endangered) list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN). Of over 30 owl species found in India, one falls under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, while the rest are schedule IV. The Act prohibits the trade of owls in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ahead-of-diwali-corbett-staff-on-alert-mode-leaves-of-personnel-cancelled-over-threat-of-owl-poaching/articleshow/87376616.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Medical reports pointed at 'rape', so the complainant's clothes and swabs were collected for investigation, said sources. However, swabs taken from the woman didn't match the DNA of any of the accused. Further investigation led cops to ask the woman's son-in-law to give his sample for a DNA test. It matched. During questioning, he confessed to being sexually involved with his mother-in-law. The complainant and her son-in-law admitted to implicating four of their neighbours in a false case because of a dispute over installation of a new hand pump.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-fake-gang-rape-complaint-gets-woman-son-in-law-10-years-jail/articleshow/87381083.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects Deshmukh plea on ED summons||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday rejected a plea by former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, seeking to quash summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), asking him to appear before it in connection with a case of alleged money laundering and corruption. The HC said that Deshmukh had failed to make a case for quashing of such summons. It said that the former minister’s plea did not merit an order to ED and CBI, restraining them from taking coercive action against him. The court said Deshmukh, like any other common litigant, had the right to approach an appropriate court seeking relief if he apprehended his arrest in the case. The court also directed ED to permit Deshmukh's lawyer to remain present within “visible distance but not audible distance” at the central agency’s office during Deshmukh’s questioning. ED had begun a probe against Deshmukh and others, and summoned him for questioning after CBI filed an FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 on charges of corruption and misuse of official position. The CBI FIR was registered following a preliminary inquiry into allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled against Deshmukh by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.

The deceased were identified as Avanish Kumar (32), Munna Singh (32), Dhiresh Kumar Alias Gultu (40) and Avinash Kumar Ram (35) from Rupauli and Vipul Sahi (35) from neighbouring Vishahar Patti village under Saraiyya police station area. Liquor is prohibited in Bihar. The hooch party was organised by one Amit Kumar to celebrate his victory as a member of ward number 12 of Rupauli panchayat in the election held recently. “They had consumed hooch at the house of one Dhiresh on Wednesday night in a party thrown by Amit after winning the panchayat election. Dhiresh had arranged liquor pouches and bottles from different locations. He was interested in displaying muscle power in the village due to a land dispute,” Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant told TOI over phone on Friday. He said Amit and three others have been arrested. “We don’t have any report if more villagers are under treatment or ill due to consumption of poisonous hooch,” he added. Saraiyya police station additional SHO Mohammad Kalamuddin said Avanish and Munna died on Thursday night while the other three passed away on Friday morning. “Only Munna and Vipul could be taken to hospital and died during treatment. Rest three died at their respective homes,” he said. Kalamuddin also said all of them had started complaining of nausea, vomiting, stomach ache and some other problems since Thursday morning. This is the second hooch tragedy in the state within six days. On Sunday night, four persons had died allegedly due to consuming hooch in two villages under Guthani police station area in Siwan district. Overall, at least four hooch tragedies have been reported in the state this month. One Ranjeet Kumar Singh (55) died on October 12 and while Aman Kumar (25) fell ill due to poisonous hooch consumption at Baikunthpur village under Rajapakar police station area in Vaishali.

---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad bypoll: Massive turnout expected||HYDERABAD: Will the Huzurabad by-poll on Saturday record its highest ever polling percentage? Indications are that nearly 90% of the voters will line up outside polling booths to get inked given that it’s a neck-and-neck fight between TRS and BJP and both sides have turned the election into a prestige issue. Sources in the two parties said they are working overtime to ensure they don’t miss out on a single vote. The parties have even asked those who have their votes in the constituency, but live in Hyderabad and other places, to return and vote in the election. TRS and BJP have assigned duties to local cadre to get voters to booths and have even been organising micro-level gatherings in hamlets. In the 2018 assembly elections, 83% voters of Huzurabad used their franchise. Also, by-polls across the state have witnessed very high voting so far. The average voting percentage for the five by-polls held in the state since 2016, is about 84%. In the previous by-poll in Nagarjuna Sagar in April, the turnout was 88% breaking its previous record of 80% set in the 2014 election. While the overall voting percentage for the first Telangana assembly elections in 2014 was 68.5%, the first by-poll in Narayankhed in 2016 saw it rise to 82%. It rose further to 89% in the subsequent by-poll in the same year in Palair. This has been the highest turnout so far in the by-polls in the state. Both seats were won by TRS with a landslide. In the current assembly, three by-polls have been held — Huzurnagar, Dubbak and Nagarjuna Sagar, which too had significant voter turnouts of 84%, 83% and 86%. This was also significantly higher than the turnout of roughly 70% in state assembly elections held in December 2018. With the exception of Dubbak, where the BJP won by a slim margin of a little over 1,000 votes, TRS has won the other too with big majorities. “Voter emotions do play a huge part during by-polls, but voting patterns are difficult to determine,” said S Ramakrishna, a political observer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/massive-turnout-expected-in-huzurabad-today/articleshow/87378154.cms||Koride Mahesh

In reply to an RTI query, filed by Kashipur-resident Nadeemuddin, the Lokayukta office mentioned that at present, 1,595 cases are pending with the office. Out of the pending matters, 950 complaints of alleged corruption have been received after November 1, 2013 – the time since Uttarakhand has not had a Lokayukta. The RTI response also revealed that out of the total complaints received in the last 21 years, 1,595 are still pending. Justice HSA Raza, the first Lokayukta of the state, had assumed office on October 24, 2002. Since then, the Lokayukta office has received 8,515 complaints. Nadeemuddin told TOI, “Even though the post of Lokayukta has been vacant in Uttarakhand for the last eight years, the office is continuously receiving complaints against public servants. This strengthens the point that due to the apprehension of action against themselves, the public servants of the state are not taking interest in the appointment of Lokayukta.” When asked about the issue, agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “We tabled the Lokayukta Bill in the state assembly. The bill is before the select committee. Therefore, it will not be right to comment on the matter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/with-delay-in-appointment-of-lokayukta-number-of-cases-continue-to-pile-up-in-lokayukta-office/articleshow/87376621.cms||Kautilya Singh

Addressing the ‘Exporters Conclave’, BVR Subramanyam, secretary, ministry of commerce and industry said that for achieving the $400 billion merchandise exports target in the current financial year, UP would play a vital role. “UP has huge potential to boost the country's exports of agricultural and non-agricultural produce such as leather, footwear, handicrafts, fruits and vegetables,” Subramanyam said while addressing the event. He said that the central government would work closely with the state to remove any bottlenecks in the exports value chain. Subramanyam stressed the need for promotion of infrastructure for boosting exports of unique products from UP such as carpets, footwears, handicrafts, handlooms, glassware and agricultural products. Participants in the ‘Exporters Conclave’ also included Diwakar Nath Mishra and Anant Swarup, joint secretaries, department of commerce, ministry of commerce and industry, Dr M Angamuthu, chairman, APEDA and officials from various exports promotion councils and UP government. To promote agricultural crops exports and adherence to global practices, APEDA in collaboration with Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), traders, exporters, agricultural scientists, UP government and other institutions a few months ago held a meet in Varanasi. Farmers from the various districts of UP had participated in the meet where agricultural scientists and officials from the leading institutes provided valuable inputs for promoting agricultural products exports from the region as well as adherence to globally recognised Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) by farmers. The APEDA has also facilitated exports of mango variety – Chausa and Langra sourced in collaboration with Uttar Pradesh Mandi Board to the United Arab Emirates in July, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-to-play-critical-role-in-achieving-400bnmerchandise-export-target-in-current-fiscal/articleshow/87376636.cms||---

Accusing Malik of trying to create a divide between Maharashtra and UP through his comments, Singh said the Maharashtra minister had clearly not understood the idea behind the Noida Film City. “UP has good locales, manpower and required infrastructure to set up a film city. The growth of regional cinema in the recent past will also add to the importance of this project,” he said. Singh said the proposed film city would be developed near the upcoming Jewar Airport and would have the advantage of good infrastructure like roads, expressways, power and sound law and order. “Keeping this in mind, several major players in the film industry had extended their support to the project. The film city will also generate massive employment opportunities, and local manpower which is working extensively in the Mumbai film industry, will get jobs closer home,” he said. “UP’s film city was never meant to destabilise or shift Bollywood out of Mumbai. Instead, it is aimed at providing an alternative to filmmakers amid a competitive atmosphere,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/film-city-will-create-jobs-not-destabilize-bollywood-min/articleshow/87379203.cms||---

The court made it clear that it did not go into the merits of the petition filed by advocate, Amritpal Singh Khalsa, or make any observations on the contentions raised.  The Bar Council of India informed the HC that it had on June 30 issued a press release which said that a review committee had been appointed to take into consideration the representations received from some of the associations and that it would be framing rules after noticing the issues raised. The HC bench of Justices P B Varale and Madhav Jamdar in its order said, “Considering the press release, in our opinion, the grievance raised in the petition, no more survives at this stage as the review committee is expected to take a decision.” The learned counsel for the petitioner prayed that advocate Harekrishna Mishra, appearing for Khalsa sought that the petitioner be permitted to submit his representation in view of the press release. The HC said, “In case, such representation is submitted within two weeks, the Bar Council of India shall accept the same and place it before the review committee for considering the same. The petitioner is at liberty to avail appropriate remedies, in case, the petitioner is aggrieved by the final decision taken by the Bar Council of India.’’ The press note said, “The Bar Council of India had recently amended rules relating to misconduct in Part-VI, Chapter-II of Bar Council of India Rules and added Section-V; Duties towards Society and Bar and Section VA: Code of conduct and Disqualification for members of Bar Councils and had published the same in Gazette Notification on 26.06.2021.’’ A writ petition was filed in High Court of Himachal Pradesh, challenging the amendments, but the court refused to entertain it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-disposes-of-petition-against-new-bar-council-conduct-rules/articleshow/87379208.cms||Swati Deshpande

The crime branch is to take Waze’s custody on November 1 from Taloja jail, after which he will be produced before the 37th metropolitan magistrate court. It will be the first time that Waze is taken outside the prison since his heart surgery. The NIA court directed the prison authorities to hand over Waze’s custody. After the crime branch is done with its process, he will be returned to Taloja jail. Meanwhile, on Saturday, the 37th court is also likely to issue a non-bailable warrant against Singh. The non-bailable warrant will pave the way to declare him an absconder.

Unlike the usual pattern of hoopla surrounding elections in AP, this assembly segment is receiving more attention than the Badvel bypoll, observers say. “Many survey teams have been visiting us over the last few days. They come in small groups, write complex notes, and occasionally just ask who we want to vote for. We’ve noticed these teams are from AP,” A Shyam Sundar, a retired employee said. Police suspect these inquiries are leading to betting as few districts of AP are known for political wagering. “We’re trying to avoid many of the people who are knocking on our doors,” a local who did not want to be identified said. Even text messages from AP numbers are being sent with questions such as: “How is the scene?”, “Who will win the polls?” and “Will it serve interest of people?” “We’re getting a lot of calls which wasn’t the case before. Even adjacent districts want to know what’s going on,” Kishore Reddy, a resident said. According to political observers, Dalit Bandhu scheme has also contributed to increasing interest in this particular election.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ap-survey-teams-quiz-voters-as-excitement-grows-over-poll/articleshow/87378196.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Starting from 2022, women will be eligible to join the NDA as part of a decision that the Centre informed the Supreme Court during the hearing of a petition earlier this year. General Naravane said, “This is just the first step towards gender equality in the Army, which has always been at the forefront of all initiatives. Women will feel empowered.” He said, “It’s not that we don’t have women officers. We already have women undergoing training at OTA, Chennai. They are doing exceedingly well. I am sure the NDA too will continue to prosper and flourish and bring fame and glory.” General Naravane said the character of war had been changing over the years and technology had come to play a more and more important role in the way wars were fought earlier and would be in the future. In his address after reviewing the passing out parade, General Naravane said the women cadets joining the NDA should be welcomed at the academy with professionalism and a sense of fair play.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/no-change-in-training-for-women-at-nda-army-chief/articleshow/87376708.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra government includes 961ha mangroves in reserved forest||MUMBAI: The state forest department has taken over additional 961 hectares of mangroves to be protected as reserved forest under Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. State Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray had tweeted that earlier 1,433 ha mangroves were declared as reserved forest under Section 20 of the Act. With this, the total mangrove area under protection in Ratnagiri is now more than 2,394 ha, Thackeray said in his latest tweet on Friday. Welcoming this, NatConnect Foundation director B N Kumar said thousands of hectares of mangroves in Navi Mumbai are yet to be taken over by the government for conservation as per the orders of Bombay High Court issued in September 2018. Cidco itself has said that it has over 1,000 hectares to be transferred, and a recent declaration by JNPT said it has more than 900 hectares, Kumar tweeted in respnose to Thackeray’s tweet. He pointed out that vast sea forests under Navi Mumbai SEZ are yet to be accounted for. Kharghar-based activists such as Naresh Chandra Singh and Jyoti Nadkarni have been drawing the government’s attention to the destruction of mangrove stretches in the node. This delay is only facilitating vested interests to destroy the mangroves for land-grab or illegal crab and prawn farming, greens said. Meanwhile, landfill and dumping of debris on mangroves in Ulwe and several parts of Uran have also been on the rise, Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said. Seawoods-based environmentalist Sunil Agarwal said that while it is good that mangroves are being preserved in other districts, they are being illegally destroyed and encroached upon in Navi Mumbai, where there is a plan to make a golf course. “Due to greed for real estate value, the pockets D and E of the total 35.5 ha land at Seawoods has also got MahaRera approval although it is still under litigation in Supreme Court,” Agarwal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govt-includes961-ha-mangroves-in-reserved-forest/articleshow/87379231.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli police evict Surjagarh protestors, arrest leaders||NAGPUR: In early morning high voltage drama, Gadchiroli police on Friday picked up six leaders of the ongoing ‘thiya andolan’ in Etapalli taluka against mining in Gadchiroli district, including Surjagarh project, and broke up the protest. This had become a hotly contested issue between the administration and the masses in the Maoist-affected district. A day ago, collector Sanjay Meena and SP Ankit Goyal had met agitators, assuring to help take up their concerns with the right authorities. On October 25, around 4,000 to 7,000 protesters had assembled at Etapalli to voice their angst against mining leases granted to Lloyds Metals and Energy Limited (LMEL) at Surjagarh, and to 25 other companies elsewhere. The protestors assembled at Etapalli, from where the controversial Surjagarh mine is barely 15km away. Though most of the protestors had left after the protest, around 300-odd had decided to stay put at the andolan site. This had raised an alarm in the district administration and police department, as they suspected the protestors, like farmers agitation near New Delhi, planned to camp at the site for an indefinite period. After the arrests of a Moaist action team member and a village volunteer, police department too was on toes to keep a vigil on the rebels and their sympathizers in and around the protest site. In this tense atmosphere, collector Meena and SP Goyal had to bow to the demands of the agitators to meet them at the protest site. Earlier, on October 25, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and project officer Shubham Gupta had already received a memorandum from the protestors. After Thursday’s meeting, as the agitators and their leaders refused to budge, the district administration and police department formed a strategy to evict the protestors. SDM Gupta issued a notification under section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) late on Thursday evening, prohibiting assembly of four or more people. Empowered by the notification, Gadchiroli police entered the agitators’ camp site when they were sleeping, after making announcements urging them to leave the place immediately. Zilla parishad member Sainu Gota, his wife Sheila, activists like Ramdas Jarate, his wife Jayashree, Nitin Pada and Amol Markawar were arrested. Another ZP member Lalsu Narote had left the place just before the cops cracked down on the camp. Lalsu later said police interfered with their ‘right to protest’. “The agitation was underway most peacefully and without any law and order aggravation. Though we were protesting against mining, the trucks of the mining company were passing by our venue without any hindrance. Even after cooperating with the district administration and police they forcibly evicted the protestors,” he said. SP Goyal said police amicably dealt with the situation, without any use of force. “We have most responsibly and respectfully dealt with the protestors. Even those arrested were allowed to seek bail,” he said, adding there was no need to camp and protest as their grievances had been heard already, and would be now sent forward. Sources also said some of the agitators were provided vehicles by the police to return to their distant villages. It’s learnt many of the agitators are yet to return home, but have camped in the adjoining villages and hamlets, waiting for their leaders to return from police custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/gadchiroli-police-evict-surjagarh-protestors-arrest-leaders/articleshow/87378203.cms||Soumitra Bose

In March, ED had attached seven sugar mills owned by Iqbal and his family valued at Rs 1,097crore under a similar law. CBI had booked Iqbal’s sons, Wajid and Javed, in 2019 for illegal sale of 21 state-owned sugar mills during Mayawati’s regime that scraped state coffers of Rs 1,800 crore. The money laundering charges followed a probe by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), ministry of corporate affairs, into Iqbal’s illegal acquisition of assets in 2010-2011. ED, Lucknow Zone, joint director, Rajeshwar Singh, told TOI that Iqbal and his family had fraudulently acquired land at Saharanpur in 2015 in the name of a company, BSS Associates. Singh said, unaccounted money was deposited in accounts of the former legislator and his family in 2014-15. “This was immediately transferred to the account of a shell firm, Glocal India Industries, which ploughed the money into purchase of shares of BSS Associates,” said Singh. Iqbal also conducted transactions to maintain a carefully-crafted façade to own land in Dehradun. Apart from cash deposits, entries from shell companies were used to infuse tainted money for purchase of shares of BSS Associates by Glocal India Industries. The ED joint director also said investigations into the case is underway and more attachments are on the anvil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/money-laundering-ed-attaches-rs-74cr-land-of-ex-bsp-mlc/articleshow/87379227.cms||---

The Nandgaon gram panchayat has announced a reward of Rs 10,000 in cash for the family that first uses the new funeral facility built by the gram panchayat. Also, the person who convinces the family to use the facility will be rewarded Rs 3,000. This funeral facility was built five years ago and to date, no one has used this place due to some superstitions. The villagers prefer using the old crematorium even though it is in a dilapidated condition. Ananda Kharade, a resident of the village with a population of about 1,000, said, “There is a belief that if a funeral is conducted at the new shade, evil powers will follow the family causing financial losses and eventual downfall of the family. Therefore, the funerals are still conducted at the old crematorium.” The new funeral facility was constructed at a cost of Rs 5 lakh. Geeta Gurav, the sarpanch of Nandgaon village, said, “During the monsoon, the old shed, which is located near the Manikarnika river, gets inundated with floodwater. Even then, the villagers refrain from using the new shade. They instead conduct funerals at farmlands near the old funeral shed.” “To bring in a positive change in the mentality of the villagers, the gram panchayat has decided to reward Rs 10,000 to the family that will use the abandoned funeral shed for the first time, and Rs 3,000 will be given to the person who convinces the family to use the new facility,” added Gurav. Seema Patil, a member of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti, said, “We will visit the village and try to convince the residents to stop believing in superstitions. There are no such things as evil spirits, another world and after death. If these things would have existed, the whole world would have been destroyed by now.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/rs-10k-reward-for-1st-family-to-use-new-funeral-facility-in-nandgaon/articleshow/87373851.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

This has given ammunition to activists who have been opposing the project. They have demanded that the Pune Municipal Corporation address these concerns, failing which they would move the court and the National Green Tribunal. In the letter, the irrigation department said any flooding caused by the project would become PMC’s responsibility. “Precautions must be taken to ensure the project does not cause any obstacles to the river’s flow and carrying capacity. The responsibility for safety and security of public works that are to be carried out in the prohibited zones and restricted zones will lay with the department concerned or the local self-governing body. This body will also be responsible for any probable loss of lives or damages due to floods,” stated the letter issued by the office of chief engineer (irrigation department) H V Gunale. “PMC will have to resolve these queries. We have already raised these issues. The tenders have been issued in a hurried manner, casting doubts on the whole process,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch. He said if the civic administration does not address these concerns, citizens’ groups will be left with no option to seek legal recourse. PMC officials, meanwhile, said due process was followed in issuing approval to the project. “Environmental clearances have been taken and all due precautions will be in place while implementing the project,” Yuvraj Deshmukh, a senior PMC official who is coordinating the project, said. As per the tenders, the first phase will be carried out from Sangam Ghat to Bund Garden. The work includes beautification of the banks, cycle tracks, beautification of Naik island.

Addressing the ‘Exporters Conclave’, BVR Subramanyam, secretary, ministry of commerce and industry said that for achieving the $400 billion merchandise exports target in the current financial year, UP would play a vital role. “UP has huge potential to boost the country's exports of agricultural and non-agricultural produce such as leather, footwear, handicrafts, fruits and vegetables,” Subramanyam said while addressing the event. He said that the central government would work closely with the state to remove any bottlenecks in the exports value chain. Subramanyam stressed the need for promotion of infrastructure for boosting exports of unique products from UP such as carpets, footwears, handicrafts, handlooms, glassware and agricultural products. Participants in the ‘Exporters Conclave’ also included Diwakar Nath Mishra and Anant Swarup, joint secretaries, department of commerce, ministry of commerce and industry, Dr M Angamuthu, chairman, APEDA and officials from various exports promotion councils and UP government. To promote agricultural crops exports and adherence to global practices, APEDA in collaboration with Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), traders, exporters, agricultural scientists, UP government and other institutions a few months ago held a meet in Varanasi. Farmers from the various districts of UP had participated in the meet where agricultural scientists and officials from the leading institutes provided valuable inputs for promoting agricultural products exports from the region as well as adherence to globally recognised Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) by farmers. The APEDA has also facilitated exports of mango variety – Chausa and Langra sourced in collaboration with Uttar Pradesh Mandi Board to the United Arab Emirates in July, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-to-play-critical-role-in-achieving-400bn-merchandise-export-target-in-current-fiscal/articleshow/87376720.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Dehradun||BJP members clash in Almora; party MLA punched on face, faints||Almora: BJP MLA from Salt in Almora, Mahesh Jeena, was allegedly beaten up by supporters of another BJP leader with whom Jeena had sour relations. The MLA was punched on the face when he was returning home with his son and a few other supporters after attending an event on Thursday evening. According to sources, the MLA fainted after being hit although he revived after a while. He was taken to hospital for a check-up and later released. Meanwhile, the MLA's supporters beat up Girish Kotnala, the BJP leader with whom Jeena had had an altercation earlier in the day and whose supporters are alleged to have punched the legislator. Sources said that Kotnala and Jeena share an old rivalry, as Kotnala wanted the ticket for Salt, from where Jeena contested and won in a bypoll in May this year. The seat had fallen vacant due to the death of Jeena’s brother, Surendra Singh Jeena last year. Speaking about the incident, Jeena told TOI, “We were on our way home from a Ramlila event when a vehicle with a UP registration number signaled us to stop and blocked our way. Some persons got down and one of them punched me in the face, after which I fainted. I will look into the matter once I recover.” Although Jeena refrained from naming Kotnala, the latter came out openly against the MLA. Soon after the incident, Kotnala circulated a video claiming that he was beaten up by Jeena’s men. In the video, he claimed that he was badly injured and hospitalised. “I was first taken to a hospital in Ranikhet and have now been referred to a higher facility in Kashipur. Things have come to such a state that legislators have started resorting to hooliganism,” Kotnala said. Meanwhile, SSP Almora Pankaj Bhatt said that one person had been detained after a primary investigation and was later let off due to lack of evidence. “No complained has been filed by either Jeena or Kotnala, so we have not continued the probe,” he added. When queried, the state BJP unit claimed they were not aware of the incident. “The matter has not been brought to the party's notice. If anyone is found guilty, we will take appropriate action against them,” said Manveer Singh Chauhan, state media-in-charge of the BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/bjp-members-clash-in-almora-party-mla-punched-on-face-faints/articleshow/87376718.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC plan for Naidu hospital in Baner runs into opposition||PUNE: Experts and health activists have opposed the Pune Municipal Corporation’s move to shift the civic-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital, the only dedicated infectious diseases hospital in Pune, from Tadiwala Road to Baner to make way for the proposed PMC-run medical college on the hospital’s premises. The Pune Municipal Corporatin (PMC) plans to begin construction of the proposed medical college early next month. “The decision to shifting has been taken hurriedly and without thinking and respecting the hospital’s contribution to Pune right from fighting the plague to Covid-19. Pune needs a spacious infectious diseases hospital. The hospital should be located away from crowded areas yet well-connected to major highways, roads, and metro,” one of the doctors of the hospital requesting anonymity, said. Though the medical college is important and much needed, a dedicated infectious hospital-like NIDH should not be left to die slowly, experts have emphasized. “The shifting should not lead to the process of the slow death of the NIDH. Pune should have a proper state-of-art and well equipped infectious disease hospital with ICU and biosafety level three laboratory,” said health activist and medical practitioner Sanjay Dabhade. The location of the infectious diseases hospital should be secluded yet close to mass transport services, so that people can come there in the shortest time, experts have said. Providing a riverside location is practical in urban and densely populated cities and the Pune Municipal Corporation should search for a minimum of five acres of riverside location with easy accessibility through road and mass transport, another medical staff of the NIDH said. The new location where hospital will be shifted to does not have an independent parking area. Besides, it is very close to human dwellings, he said. The Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital has been at the centre of the state’s response to the health emergencies for years. A Pune Municipal Corporation health official who did not wish to be named said, “The process of shifting is underway and may come into effect within a week or early next month.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-plan-for-naidu-hosp-in-baner-runs-into-opposition/articleshow/87376716.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Pune||Maharashtra: No sign of fresh admit cards for health exam||PUNE: Candidates appearing for Group D exam conducted by the state health department on Sunday have received a sudden notification in the last two days saying that their admit cards sent on October 25 would be re-issued. Aspirants said they had received SMSs in the last two days stating, “Dear candidate, in case you have downloaded the admit card of Group D on 25th October 21, then kindly do not consider it. The new admit card of Group D of Arogya Bharti exam will be made live.” The message on candidates’ registered cellphones has added to the confusion and phone calls to the department have not garnered any responses. However, with just one day left, and no new admit card in hand, the candidates are in a fix. Senior health department officials TOI spoke to on Friday said there were “ technical difficulties” with the admit cards that were issued. The officials added that there was no change in the exam schedule and candidates need not panic. “They will receive updates before the exam. There will not be any change in the examination,” they said. Last week, hundreds of candidates at an exam centre in Pune had problems entering the exam hall, and later with question papers. A candidate, who arrived in Pune on Friday for the exam, said that he had booked train tickets from his native place in Solapur nearly two weeks ago. He said, “The message we received from the department said the admit card issued will not be valid. But, there has not been any response after that message, and the exam is just two days away. The last exam was also poorly managed and yet again, even before the exam has started, new issues have come up.” A candidate from Parbhani in Ahmednagar, who also reached Pune for Sunday’s exam, said, “After the notification from the department, we have not received a single update on what is to be done. We called up the health department, but there was no proper response. We just hope that there is no change in the schedule of the exam because we have planned our stay and tickets accordingly.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/no-sign-of-fresh-admit-cards-for-health-exam/articleshow/87376727.cms||---

Dr Madhukar Bachulkar, an environment specialist and head of Nisarg Mitra said, “The central government is trying to create a freeway for development by destroying the forest lands.

Though the deceased, who has been identified as Rakshak Umashankar Bhure, did not possess a driving licence, Wathoda police arrested truck driver Ram Kharule (26, a resident of Nagarjun Colony, Nara Road). Police said Bahadura Fata resident Bhure was driving the two-wheeler, while his friend Sahil Patankar was riding pillion. The duo was crossing Dighori Square when a truck being driven rashly by Kharule hit their two-wheeler. The impact was such that Bhure fell before the truck and was crushed under its wheels, the police said. The deceased was riding the vehicle without a helmet. Patankar escaped with minor injuries, said the police. On being informed, Wathoda police personnel reached the spot and arrested the truck driver. The police have also detained the truck. Further probe is on. Residents of south Nagpur said the number of minors riding vehicles, especially two-wheelers, in that part of the city has increased manifold. Not only do they drive at breakneck speed but also violate various provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, the residents added. They also claimed that the traffic police deployed at many busy squares, including Dighori Square, always ignore this “blatant violation” by minors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/teen-driving-sans-licence-dies-in-road-mishap-truck-driver-nabbed/articleshow/87376751.cms||---

He held meetings with Congress leaders MP Ambika Soni, Ajay Maken and AICC treasurer Pawan Bansal. However, party leaders claimed that it was just a courtesy meet and there was no political motive behind it. Accompanied by AICC incharge of Punjab Harish Choudhary and Mohammad Mustafa, principal strategic adviser to PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Channi left for Delhi in the official chopper. His back-to-back visits to Delhi have raised questions regarding the challenges faced by both the Punjab Congress and the state government in handling the changing political situation and the infighting in the party unit. Apart from evaluating the possible impact of former CM Amarinder Singh’s decision to launch his own political outfit, the party leadership is also trying to sort out the differences between Channi and Sidhu. The party has been trying to ensure that Amarinder is not allowed to poach on Congress leaders. The state government has been holding deliberations on taking action on the sacrilege issue and cancel the power purchase agreements and Channi has given an update to Rahul, besides briefing him about the pro-poor policies of the state government. Meanwhile, the ongoing situation has created difficulties for Congress to prepare for the upcoming assembly elections even as other parties have already launched various public-contact programmes. CRITICISM OF FREQUENT DELHI VISITS SAD leader Parambans Singh Romana tweeted: “Punjab ik suba hai Charannjit Singh Channi saab koi “Bed and Breakfast” nahi. (Punjab is a state, not a Bed and Breakfast)”. Another twitter user, Ajinkya Vyawahare, said: “I think Channi Sahab ( Resp CM of Punjab) should get a monthly pass from Punjab to Delhi. Individual trips cost so much that monthly pass should save some amount to the Gov of Punjab.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/channi-returns-to-delhi-meets-party-seniors/articleshow/87378229.cms||---

The owners of these establishments told the court that they haven't encroached upon the sanctuary land and that their businesses are not being run out of illegally-constructed structures. They added that all the norms of the state pollution control board (SPCB) are also being adhered to. However, only Spare Head Adventure, a hotel built in the early 1900s, was able to submit a document proof of the permission it had received from the National Wildlife Board. Jordan Mishra, who owns the hotel, also showed the documentary proof of the permission he received to repair the century-old building. Meanwhile, the SPCB stated that none of these establishments have sought its permission. The SPCB also told the court that it had written a letter to the divisional forest officer of Almora, asking to give details of the permissions (if any) procured by the businesses running inside the reserve. After hearing the arguments, the division bench of Chief Justice Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik maintained that any sort of construction activity remains prohibited inside the reserve. Earlier, the court had asked the petitioner, Kotdwar-resident Giri Gaurav Naithani, to submit a list of the “illegal” establishments running inside the reserve.

They are landowners,” a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy told finance secretary K Ramakrishna Rao who was before the court under summons. The bench was hearing a contempt plea filed by Bakkuri Linganna and four other farmers from Ratnapur village in Balconda mandal of Jagtial district whose 3 acres was acquired by the state as part of land acquisition for Pochampadu irrigation project in 1966. Since then the farmers have been litigating for compensation. Farmers’ counsel Gudi Madhusudhan Reddy said that the state had failed to keep its promise despite repeated assurances and undertakings before the court. When the states’ counsel showed the high court bench a finding from the lower court that the compensation amount needs to be recalculated again, Madhusudhan Reddy said that it was nothing but a ruse by state to deny justice. “The state government is now trying to dispute the claim amount only to dodge the issue for some more years,” he said. The high court bench asked the farmers’ counsel to challenge the finding of the lower court and adjourned the case to December 16. According to Gudi Madhusudhan Reddy, the counsel for the farmers, state assured the courts that it would compensate the farmers, but has been repeatedly failing||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-fumes-over-55-yr-delay-in-relief-for-ryots/articleshow/87378221.cms||---

Among the PMR segments, the rural parts have recorded highest 58% decline in active caseload in the one-month period. Data by the district health office has revealed that active cases in PMC limits came down by 45% in the aforementioned period, while the Pimpri Chinchwad area reported a decline of 26%. Health officials said the active count in the rural parts has dropped to 1,570 now. “The drop in cases has also led to a decline in the number of hotspot areas in the rural parts. Rural area with 10 or more active cases comes under hotspot area in Pune rural. The daily case count in the rural areas has been ranging from 200 to 400 since the last few days. There are around 34 hotspot villages in the rural parts,” a health official said. PMC and PCMC health officials said the case count was below 1,000 in their limits for over a week now. “The numbers are on the decline as the city is adding less than 100 patients every day, which has helped in pushing down active patients’ count to 850. We are monitoring the cases at the ward level. The congested areas have been reporting lesser number of cases and have not recorded any rise,” said Sanjeev Wavre, deputy chief at the PMC’s health department. Another official from the PMC health department said, “Even though the cases are on the decline, we are urging citizens to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and home isolation guidelines. Citizens are requested to continue using face covers while stepping out despite having completed both the doses of the vaccine.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmrs-active-cases-drop-by-51-in-just-a-month-rural-areas-lead/articleshow/87376736.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Goa||Policy ready to scrap old cars, obsolete items in govt offices||Panaji: State government offices will soon be rid of scrap lying around their premises as the state cabinet on Friday approved policy guidelines for condemnation of vehicles and obsolete items, scrap material, unserviceable equipment as well as items or articles and furniture among others. This will be applicable for all government departments and agencies, autonomous bodies in the state. The policy, prepared by Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC), lays procedural guidelines for old vehicles and obsolete items such as the criteria for condemnation of vehicles and other unserviceable items as per prevailing rules. It also explains the procedure for their condemnation and final disposal. In case the vehicle to be condemned does not fulfill the necessary criteria for condemnation, the policy lays out steps to be followed. Large quantity of unusable assets are stored or stacked at various government departments and offices which occupy space and over time the resalable value decreases due to depreciation. Considering the importance to action long-pending condemnation requests from various departments due to non-availability of records/documents, the policy proposes to launch a ‘one-time clearance for condemnation and disposal scheme’ for all departments. The policy proposes to develop a digital data collection asset management information system (AMIS). The portal will act as a digital register of ‘dead stock’ for all departments/agencies where records and inventory of the assets available and purchased by the department over time will be maintained. All government organisations will have a login ID to register and submit details of their assets. AMIS will also function as mode of communication with GWMC for condemnation and related information. As part of one-time clearance for condemnation and disposal scheme, a condemnation committee under GWMC will function with officials having expertise in engineering (mechanical, civil, electrical, IT) and finance, equivalent to the level of accountant or assistant accounts officer. Public Works Department (PWD) officials will be deputed on work arrangement basis and who have expertise in condemnation of vehicles, unserviceable equipment, items, articles, furniture etc. under the chairmanship of the managing director of GWMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/policy-ready-to-scrap-old-cars-obsolete-items-in-govt-offices/articleshow/87378224.cms||---

Overall, the share of the state’s 27 municipal areas in the expecting mothers’ vaccination remained low compared with the 34 districts’ peri-urban and rural areas, the report showed. So far, the municipal areas have vaccinated 8,265 pregnant women with the first jab as against 24,016 women from small towns and villages. Pregnant women started getting the jab in India in July. “We are verifying the data with the three civic corporation officials. We have an inkling that some of the pregnant women opted for the jabs under the age group category instead of the pregnant women category,” state immunization officer Sachin Desai told TOI. Although three municipal areas have recorded zero vaccination in pregnant women, the districts’ semi-urban and rural parts have vaccinated some. “Amaravati district recorded vaccination of 16 women, followed by Parbhani (142) and Solapur (3,042) with the first shot,” Desai said. One of the reasons why the vaccination is more among pregnant women in the districts’ rural/semi-urban areas could be attributed to the network of community women health workers called ASHA. “ASHAs pay door-to-door visit, counsel pregnant women about the benefits of Covid vaccination and ensure that they get the shot voluntarily. This could be one of the reasons why pregnant women’s vaccination is comparatively better in the state’s rural/semi-urban areas,” said public health expert Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services. “Pune's small towns and villages’ 1,144 pregnant women received the first shot till October 27. But PMC and PCMC areas recorded vaccination of 356 and 220 women with the first shot so far,” health activist Sanjay Dabhade said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/states-3-civic-bodies-record-zero-vaccination-of-pregnant-women/articleshow/87376761.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This results in the piling up of applications due to which there is a huge delay in disposing them off.The petitioner stated that the number of information commissioners and employees are also not sufficient to dispose of the second appeals. He stated that presently a chief information commissioner and six information commissioners are available in the SIC to deal with the second appeals. That apart, when the applications are taken up for hearing, the applicants have to go to the commission at Chennai.He stated that due to enormous delay and the fact that the applicants from different parts of the state have to go to Chennai to pursue their second appeals, many applicants hesitate to file second appeals since they have lost faith in the system. This has defeated the prime objective of the RTI Act which mandates timely response to the citizens request for information and to ensure transparency in the functioning of the government departments.He stated that establishing a bench at Madurai would definitely be helpful to prevent the delay in disposing of the pending second appeals. Since there was no response to the representation sent in this regard, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/plea-in-hc-for-madurai-bench-of-info-panel/articleshow/87378232.cms||---
---||Pune||CVC staffers look for alternatives to avoid wastage||Pune: The government and private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) across the Pune Metropolitan Region are adopting new measures to avoid vaccine wastage amid the slowdown in the vaccination drive. The private hospitals are calling at least 10 beneficiaries at a particular time slot to open a vial of Covishield or Covaxin, containing 10 doses to be used within four hours. The waiting time at most of the government-run CVCs has also increased of late, this time not because of the rush but due to fewer beneficiaries across the sites. At the Annasaheb Magar secondary school vaccination site, only 25 shots of Covishield were given until 2pm on Friday. A total of 31,124 beneficiaries were jabbed on Friday across 736 sites in the district. The vaccinator at the Annasaheb Magar secondary school vaccination site, Pallavi Netane, said, “In the morning session, we have to make sure at least 10 people are present. If the number is low, we wait until it reaches 10. After 3pm, we wait for at least eight beneficiaries to avoid huge wastage.” District Hospital Aundh, the only dedicated Covaxin vaccination site in the district, has the option of multiple sizes of Covaxin vial to cater to the need of vaccination. “We have 10ml, 5ml and 2.5ml vials of Covaxin, which can cater to 20, 10 and five doses, respectively. Accordingly, we can use 10ml or 5ml vials at the beginning of the day’s vaccination, when there is a little rush of beneficiaries. We use five-dose vials to reduce the chances of wastage towards the day’s end,” said J S Ghodake, the hospital’s vaccination in charge. She said out of 73,000 Covaxin shots administered, only 146 doses went waste. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, said private hospitals were opting for prior bookings to avoid wastage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cvc-staffers-look-for-alternatives-to-avoid-wastage/articleshow/87376752.cms||Piyush Bhusari

City unit chief of NCP Prashant Jagtap also questioned mayor Murlidhar Mohol’s role in the matter. Mohol refuted the allegations, stating that Jagtap’s charges were baseless. A complaint was registered against a BJP corporator with the Wanworie police for cheating the contractor on the pretext of helping him secure civic contracts. “The case of this contractor is not one of its kind in the PMC. BJP leaders demanded such type of bribes earlier also. Complaints were raised against them, but they were brushed under the carpet,” said Jagtap, while speaking to reporters at the press conference on Friday. Jagtap said one of the BJP leaders, husband of a BJP corporator, said in his statement to the police that he had pressurised the complainant contractor on the instruction of the mayor. Pressure was exerted to withdraw the case against the BJP corporator, Jagtap said. BJP should explain its stand on the matter, he said. Jagtap alleged that complaints were also registered against the leader of the house and BJP leader Ganesh Bidkar, alleging disproportionate assets in the past. BJP should also clarify its stand on it. Mayor Mohol claimed in the press conference that NCP’s claims were false. Bidkar said the allegations were “politically motivated” and “were done to be in limelight”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ncp-cheating-barb-at-bjp-mayor-refutes-the-charge/articleshow/87376779.cms||---

There are many who have already done pre-bookings for two-wheelers, cars and mini- SUVs to be picked on Dhanteras day. Manager of a reputed four-wheeler brand Asim Habib said that though the stock of some vehicles is unavailable currently due to high demand in the festive season, many are showing interest in new models and have expressed their desire to buy them. “The strength of walk-in customers is high in comparison to last year. People have booked in advance with us. Mostly customers are opting to buy a four-wheeler which ranges between Rs 6-8 lakh,” he added. “Most four-wheeler customers are choosing lower range multipurpose and sports utility vehicles. The situation is better than last year,” said Sudhanshu Lal, the manager at a car showroom in Indira Nagar. Zeeshan Ali, manager at a two-wheeler showroom, said that this time many customers are showing their love for the new range of scooters. “Apart from asking about the features, the customers now demand colours of their choice. They want the usual blue, black, white, grey, and also yellow and red. Last year, 250 vehicles were booked on Dhanteras. As of now, we have received bookings of two-wheelers more than the four wheelers,” said Ali. “The medium range luxury bikes are in demand right now because of their better mileage along with the latest technology. We are providing offers on accessories along with some free gifts to those who are opting to pre-book,” said Kaushal Sharma, manager of a prominent bike brand. Rakesh Singh, manager at another two-wheeler showroom said, “The business has witnessed a spike of about 10% in comparison to 2000 two-wheelers we sold last year.” “This year it was my desire to exchange my old bike with a new one. Dhanteras being the most auspicious occasion of the year, I have booked a bike,” said Dheeraj Jaiswal, a customer. Rishita Saxena, who bought a scooter, said, “I wanted to buy a new scooter for a long time now but I dreamt of buying it with my hard earned money.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/auto-sector-eyes-pre-covid-era-like-sales-on-dhanteras/articleshow/87379255.cms||---
---||Madurai||Visit jails to create legal awareness in prisoners: Madras HC to principal district judges, chief judicial magistrates||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Friday directed the principal district judges (PDJ) and chief judicial magistrates (CJM) of the concerned districts to visit prisons once in a month to create legal awareness to the prisoners about their rights to file appeals against the convictions. The court gave this direction after taking into account that a large number of prisoners have not filed appeals against their convictions. During the previous hearing, the Tamil Nadu state legal services authority (TNSLA) submitted a report stating that as many as 553 convict prisoners in the central, open air and special prisons for women across the state have not filed appeals. The court had directed the TNSLA to inquire and submit a report as to whether the 553 prisoners are willing to file an appeal. Pursuant to the earlier direction, the member secretary of TNSLA, K Rajasekar appeared before the court through video conferencing and submitted a report. He stated that of the 553 convicts, only 67 came forward to file appeals through the TNSLA and 85 have filed appeals by engaging private counsels. The remaining 401 convicts have not come forward to file appeals, despite the best legal awareness given to them by the panel advocates of the TNSLA as well as by the para-legal volunteers. Taking cognizance of the report, a division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and S Ananthi appreciated the prompt steps taken by the member secretary to provide legal awareness to the prisoners to file the appeals. Considering the fact that a large number of prisoners have not filed any appeals, the judges gave the direction to all the PDJs and CJMs. The court passed the order while hearing the criminal appeal filed by S Pathipoornam of Tirunelveli district in 2018 challenging the conviction and life sentence imposed on him by the Tirunelveli II additional sessions court on November 20, 1996. The appellant was accused of rape and murder of a woman in 1994.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/visit-jails-to-instil-legal-awareness-in-prisoners-hc-to-pdjs-cjms/articleshow/87378231.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Chandigarh||Bains will not appear as spl prosecutor, HC told||Chandigarh: The Punjab government on Friday gave an undertaking before the Punjab and Haryana high court that senior advocate Rajvinder Singh Bains would not appear as the special prosecutor before the trial court in cases related to firing incidents in Punjab’s sacrilege cases. The government gave the undertaking before the bench of Justice Raj Mohan Singh in response to a petition filed by Amarjit Singh Kullar, an accused in the case. In his plea, Kullar, former SHO of Bajakhana police station, submitted that advocate Bains had appeared for complainant and the firing victim’s kin in two separate writ petitions filed in the past before the HC. The HC was informed that as per the settled law, the public prosecutor is to act in an independent and impartial manner. However, in view of the previous engagements of advocate Bains as counsel for the complainant and the victim, there is an apparent and manifest conflict of interest. “Even otherwise the appointment of advocate R S Bains as special prosecutor is in violation of Section 24 CrPC as the fact of his representing the complainant and the kin of the victim as a counsel was not considered in the decision making process of his appointment by the state of Punjab. Besides, there has been no consultation with the high court on its administrative side of the appointment of Bains as a counsel, which is mandatory,” the counsel for the petitioner Sangram Singh Saron argued before the HC. During the hearing of the case, the counsel representing the Punjab government told the HC that Bains would not appear as the special public prosecutor in these cases till the next date of hearing. On October 1, the Punjab government had appointed senior advocate Rajvinder Singh Bains as the special public prosecutor in four FIRs related to Punjab’s sacrilege cases. As a special public prosecutor, Bains would represent the Punjab government in two FIRs registered at Kotkapura and two FIRs registered at Bajakhana police station in Behbal Kalan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bains-will-not-appear-as-spl-prosecutor-hc-told/articleshow/87378235.cms||---

While 23 witnesses had come forward between October 8 and October 26, a total of 48 people showed up in just four days after the SC’s directive. Twenty-six people recorded their statements on Friday under section 164 of the CrPC before the court of the judicial magistrate, said special prosecution officer S P Yadav. “Overall 71 people have recorded their statements in both the FIRs but most of the witnesses are related to the first FIR that was registered by the farmers,” said Yadav. A cross-FIR had also been lodged against the farmers by one of the accused after violence broke out in Tikunia on October 3. “Police have provided security to all the witnesses as per the directions of the Supreme Court and we are expecting more witnesses to turn up now,” said Yadav. The witnesses have been provided an armed constable each for protection. Extra security cover has been provided to those who were witness to the accused running away from the spot while firing in the air. Till now, 13 people, including Union minister of state Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish, have been arrested for allegedly mowing down farmers while two farmers were also held for alleged lynching of BJP workers. Jasbir Singh Virk, a prominent Sikh leader and national president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangthan, said they were satisfied with the security cover. “We are trying to convince the farmers, who were there in Tikunia on October 3, to turn up in large numbers and ensure their statement is recorded in court. We shouldn’t leave any stone unturned and ensure justice is served to families of our brothers who were killed,” he said. On October 26, a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana had expressed surprise over the number of eye witnesses made by the prosecution in the case and said, “The case is that thousands of farmers were going on and a rally was going on. Only 23 witnesses are eye witnesses?” The apex court had then ordered the protection of witnesses. The bench had asked the UP government, represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Garima Prasad, to record the statements of other relevant witnesses before judicial magistrates under CrPC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/kheri-violence-security-cover-for-all-71-witnesses-kin-of-deceased-after-sc-order/articleshow/87376796.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He is also not on the board of directors (BoD) of NVCC, which is mandatory as per guidelines of the chamber. The matter came to fore after NVCC vice-president Arjundas Ahuja lodged a complaint with guardian minister Nitin Raut on October 23. He demanded an offence be registered against Mehadia, all decisions taken by him be set aside, deals done by NVCC in the last two years be cancelled, and fresh elections be held. The election for president and other posts is held every year. “Mehadia did not reveal to NVCC about his DIN disqualification. He told me to remain quiet and assured that I would be made the president. He has been cheating the chamber since two years,” Ahuja wrote in his complaint. As per the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), Mehadia’s DIN 02910003 is under disqualification from November 1, 2016 to October 31, 2021. At MCA, Mehadia’s name is registered with Agrawal as the surname. According to advocate Anil Kumar Mulchandani, “DIN is must for appointment as director in any company under Companies Act 2013. Also, no one can be re-appointed as director if DIN is under disqualification.” Accepting that his DIN is disqualified, Mehadia said, “I am not a director in NVCC. My appointment is as president, which is an organizational designation as per hierarchy. In Companies Act, appointment of chairman is mentioned and not about the president. It is not a pre-requisite that a person to be appointed as president of NVCC has to be a director. Since, I am not a director, my DIN’s disqualification is immaterial.” As per clause No. 27 (a) of the Articles of Associations of NVCC, the chamber shall be managed by the BoD consisting of president, three vice-presidents, secretary, treasurer, three joint secretaries and PRO. According to Mulchandani, it is clear from NVCC’s articles of associations that BoD runs the chamber and president should be one of the directors. “Any company has to be run by BoD as per the Companies Act also,” he said. Mehadia was re-elected as president in the annual general body meeting held on October 20, 2020. The election of president and other posts was held as per provisions under Companies Act which is clearly mentioned in minutes of the meeting released on November 18, 2020. Also, as per documents with TOI, Mehadia has signed the financial statements submitted to MCA as president. Mulchandani feels it is a case of “impersonation, oppression and irregularity and liable for imprisonment”. “Any shareholder can challenge it before the National Company Law Tribunal,” he said. Records show Mehadia uses this surname on letterheads and in some meetings. In others, and with MCA, Mehadia becomes Agrawal. Mehadia said he has not created any separate identity and “hence there is no question of impersonation”. “It is common practice to mention the caste instead of surname. I belong to Agrawal community and so my name in legal documents is with that surname. This does not give me any specific benefit and there is no question of suppressing facts,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/plaint-against-nvcc-prez-for-holding-office-despite-din-disqualification/articleshow/87376785.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

This was revealed by minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi to reporters here on Friday.He said the CCRT had sent a circular to the official by email on October 18 asking for details of teachers for training on arts and culture in connection with New Education Policy 2020. “The centre has been conducting training programmes for teachers across states since 1979. But in this email it was mentioned that the training is NEP-related,” he said.Though it was a normal section level circular on which the joint director had spontaneously acted, the minister said that the official should have been careful since NEP 2020 is strongly opposed by the state government. Mahesh said the official had acted independently without bringing it to the notice of the government or the principal secretary of the department. “Today it is a lesson for us,” he said adding that the principal secretary for school education on Friday issued an order to the CEOs withdrawing the circular from the joint director and asking them not to provide the details. The minister also said that officials have been asked to bring any circular or GO from the Centre to the notice of senior officials in the department and to the government and not to act independently.Responding to a question, the minister said it might have been a normal practice for officials to directly respond to such emails from the Centre during the AIADMK regime but that cannot continue now. “A lot of systems have reformed in the last five months,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/edu-official-shunted-out-for-sending-nep-linked-circular/articleshow/87378240.cms||---

Officials are trying to get the roads repaired at the earliest. The Uttar Pradesh government had earlier decided to open the reserves 15 days early and all preparations were in place, but things didn't go as planned due to the incessant rainfall. The last tourism season was also cut short due to heavy rains and the second wave of Covid-19. DTR field director Sanjay Pathak said, “We have been working hard to ensure that the reserve opens for tourists from November 15. Water from overflowing rivers has washed away several roads. We are trying to get these repaired as early as possible." PTR deputy director Naveen Khandelwal told TOI, “We had initially planned to open the park for tourists on November 1, and had even started receiving bookings, but heavy rains in terai and Uttarakhand led to flood situation in Pilibhit. Many areas are still waterlogged. We will try to repair all the Safari routes by the first week of November. If it doesn't rain, we will most probably open the park for tourists from November 15.” Tourists are disappointed with the decision of the authorities. Neeraj Rathore, a regular visitor to Dudhwa, said, “The tiger reserves in MP and Rajasthan remain open for most of the year. Here, we had to wait for six months, and now it has been delayed further. They can deploy more elephants for safari instead of using cars as it will be more adventurous and attractive to tourists.” Dhaniram alias Monu, a guide in Dudhwa, told TOI, “Though we are disappointed, the decision is correct as most of the safari routes are waterlogged. If the tourists are not able to visit most of the locations due to waterlogging, the safari will not be interesting. We ensure a ride of about 35 kilometres in three hours, and it is not possible at present.” A forester deployed in the core area of Dudhwa forests told TOI, “The flood was disastrous. I have never seen such a flood in recent years. There was three feet of water in our cottages, and we had to patrol on foot in most of the areas.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/flood-effect-dudhwa-pilibhit-tiger-reserves-not-to-open-for-tourists-on-nov-1/articleshow/87376774.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Lucknow||Ang Sanskar: A pre-diwali touch up for charismatic Kali of Lucknow||LUCKNOW: For most idol makers, molding black clay into divine sculptures for pujo is a usual affair. But each year before Diwali, third generation sculptor Sujit Paul shoulders deific duty – the unique responsibility to renew the idol of Kali at Lucknow’s Ghasiyari Mandi Kali Bari – and prepare for her the revered and ritualistic Kali and Annakoot puja ceremonies. What makes his task daunting is the fact that the idol is a living goddess. Fragility of structure is also a challenge. Established in 1863 soon after the Kali Bari of Lucknow came into being, the idol is in its original form. “It is perhaps the only idol of its kind in the country. Unlike any stone, the deity is made of black clay. She is also extremely powerful for she is Kali sitting atop Shiva and Bhairav over a panchmundi aasan (a seat made over five human skulls). No ordinary being can stand for long in the place forget touching her,” said Gautam Bhattacharya, president managing committee. It’s a living deity’s touch up: The biggest difference in the work at Kali Bari and other assignments is that the deity here is living. “Rituals are performed for her several times a day which creates immense energy around her. This changes the entire way we treat her as other Durga idols are just structures till pran pratishta is performed,” explained Sujit who was barely in his late teens when he began this work. Sharing more, temple priest Amit Goswami said: “Whenever a deity is incarnated into a temple – the pran is invoked in ghatt (earthen pot) and pat (idol). Of the two, ghatt is more important for ceremonial purposes. We cannot take withdraw the pran once it is invoked and therefore the deity is a living being.” A closed door devout affair: In temples, the presiding deity is treated as a living being who is taken care of like a head of the family. With divine and elevated elders like Maa Kali, the systems and protocols are extremely strict. Rituals like bhog (meals) and shayan (rest) of the deities are always a closed-door affair but the ceremony of ang sanskar is a strict no-no for any third person. Only the artist and purohit are allowed. No one else can even peep inside. The ceremony begins with artist Sujit seeking the deity’s permission to touch her and bless him to undertake the task. Thereafter, the deity is served her bhog so that the artist gets his undisturbed stint for work. When ready, the purohit and Sujit enter with the former removing her ornaments and clothes. “My job begins with looking for small cracks (if any) and repairing them. Once the base dries, different colour paints are used to renew her face and hands,” said Sujit who takes about 2.5 hours to do his work which also includes touch-up of the Shiva and Bhairav idols below her. Before departing, Sujit surrenders himself for kshama yachana (apology) in the presence of the purohit. Once the touch up done dries, ceremonies are re-started after cleansing rituals. The chosen one: For three generations, Sujit and his family has undertaken the devi’s ang sanskar as a duty they have been chosen for. For over 90 years now, they have not taken a penny for the divine work they undertake. And the day the undertake the ceremony, they adhere to a strict code to maintain the piety of the place. This includes fasting, staying away from any kind of addiction, abstain from taking food or water till the task is completed and not stopping in between. Sujit calls this time as a return of his good-deeds. “While most can come and take the blessings of the Devi from far, I get to serve her like a son for hours at length without anyone disturbing me,” says the sculptor who took his degrees from Arts College Lucknow and Banaras Hindu University. Renewed Kali remains an engima for most: The Ghasiyari Mandi Kali Bari of Lucknow is a revered seat of power and faith. Till the mid-1990s, actual animal sacrifice took place here and those believing in tantra sadhana spent hours in penance. “The idol here is more than just a matter of faith. This sesquicentennial structure is a historical legacy that can perplex conservators. The mere fact that the simple structure has survived for more than 150 years is a mystery in its own way. Artist Sujit has told us that the armature over which the idol is formed has fused into one and the outer layer has hardened so much that the paint doesn’t percolate into it. Most of us who serve her feel she is an enigma in the truest sense,” said Abhijeet Sarkar, president of the Trust that maintains the temple and undertakes charitable activities under its aegis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ang-sanskar-a-pre-diwali-touch-up-for-charismatic-kali-of-lucknow/articleshow/87379296.cms||Shailvee Sharda

And when such an incident happens, a show-cause notice is issued, but no concrete action is taken. The officials keep on reconstructing roads without even checking the status of underground water supply and sewer lines. If they first scratch existing material and check the underground system before laying new roads, such incidents can be avoided.” The residents said FIR should be registered against the MC officials for dereliction of duty as it could have proved fatal. A resident of Sarabha Nagar, Geeta Sharma, said, “The civic officials are not bothered about the safety of residents and this is the reason that roads are turning dangerous for the public. Only show-cause notices will not serve the purpose.” Meanwhile, repair work is going on at the spot. Officials repairing the road said, “It will take another three to four days for things to set as old storm-sewer system is damaged badly. We suspect that underground cables are passing through sewer line. It is due to damage to the sewer line that the road caved in.”Sub-divisional officer Anshul Garcha said, “The old storm-sewer system is punctured and we are fixing the fault. We have repaired the water supply lines that were damaged on Thursday. The water supply is now normal in the locality. It seems that the damage was done at least eight to 10 months back and gradually the sand settled down and road became hollow. It will take a few days to cover it up and fix it.” In the October 24 incidents, the MC authorities had served show-cause notices on contractors as a face-saving exercise. A notice was served for Haibowal main road accident, in which a car had got stuck in the caved-in road. Another show-cause notice was issued for Shivaji Nagar drain accident, after a two-wheeler rider fell into it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/deep-nagar-road-cave-in-accident-activist-files-plaint-with-rights-panel/articleshow/87370606.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Picture that’s ‘baki’ will end only when Sameer Wankhede loses job, says Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: A day after putting out the filmy dialogue ‘Picture abhi baki hai mere dost,’ NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Friday said the film will be over only after NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede loses his job which he secured on the basis of a “forged” caste certificate. “I will expose him on a daily basis. I want to reiterate that the main organizer of the cruise rave party, Kashif Khan, was let off as he is a personal friend of Wankhede’s. I have massive evidence against Wankhede and politicians involved in illegal activities. A section of high-profile BJP leaders has been frequently visiting NCB’s office ever since Wankhede took over the reins of the western zone. I will expose them during the winter session of the state legislature. Once I speak, most of them will leave their political activities,” Malik claimed. Malik alleged that Wankhede, with the help of the BJP, was maligning the image of the MVA government. “BJP is making all-out efforts to shift the Bollywood industry to Uttar Pradesh. It is all a conspiracy designed by the BJP.” On Wankhede’s wife Kranti writing to CM Uddhav Thackeray saying he should help her as she is a ‘Marathi manoos,’ Malik said he too is Marathi as his family has been staying in Maharashtra for more than seven decades. “I was born in 1959, and since then have been a permanent resident of Mumbai. Am I not Marathi?” Malik said at a media conference. Malik said he put out the picture of Wankhede’s first wife with her prior consent. “His first wife herself sent the pictures. So far as Kranti is concerned, I have never uttered a word against her. In my opinion, she should not use the Marathi card. Kranti Redkar should not forget that her husband was part of a conspiracy to defame Maharashtra and Mumbai,” Malik said. Ever since Aryan Khan was arrested, Malik has launched a campaign against the NCB, saying all raids conducted by the central agency are fake. With a section of BJP leaders taking him on over his family business, Malik said his father was a scrap dealer and he too was involved in the family business. “I am proud of my business. My father was a scrap dealer, and I too was assisting him. It’s our family business,” he said. Malik said the main task of a scrap dealer is to collect scrap, melt it and use it effectively for commercial purposes. “Now, I have decided to collect (political) scrap from all over Mumbai, and each and every nut and bolt will be melted and used suitably,” Malik said. Wankhede has denied charges levelled by Malik and has said the minister has been lying.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-picture-thats-baki-will-end-only-when-wankhede-loses-job-says-malik/articleshow/87379332.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

In a letter to them, association president S P Jeyapragasam said Tamil Nadu and Kerala are among the worst hit states as they depend on other states, particularly north Indian, for many food items. These include wheat, cumin, mustard, fenugreek and fennel seeds, tamarind, coriander etc. Only half the required quantity of rice for Tamil Nadu is cultivated in the state and the rest is brought from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Wheat is transported from north Indian states, processed into maida, rava, atta and distributed in our state while 25% is transported to Kerala. TN cultivates only 30% to 40% of chillies and the rest is transported from Andhra Pradesh. Coriander is brought from Rajasthan, processed in Tamil Nadu and 80% of it is marketed in Kerala. Tamil Nadu depends on Rajasthan, Gujarat and the northern states for cumin, mustard, fenugreek and fennel seeds. Packaged masala food products are produced in Tamil Nadu and about half of it is marketed in other states. Sago produced in Salem and Namakkal is primarily transported to North India. The diesel price hike has escalated cost of transportation from farms to mills and processing centres within the state and to the markets. In most of these cases, there is no alternative to use of diesel for transportation. “The central as well as state government should take these facts into consideration and bring petroleum products under goods and services tax (GST) or reduce the tax on fuel by 50%,” Jeyapragasam added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/grain-traders-urge-pm-cm-to-reduce-tax-on-fuel/articleshow/87378282.cms||---

Sukanya delivered a baby boy at her maternal house in 2017. Chozhan visited her but refused to take her back to his house citing her caste. Upset over this, Sukanya lodged a complaint with the Jeeyapuram police station on December 16, 2017. Police intervened and advised Chozhan to live with Sukanya. He then took her to his house. Police said that Chozhan, who felt humiliated by his wife’s decision to go to the police station, killed her by throwing a grinding stone on her head when she was sleeping in the early hours on December 17, 2017.

The firm is building a huge commercial complex near City Pride, Kothrud. In a judgment on October 8, a five-member NGT special bench, led by its chairperson Justice A K Goel, gave 12 weeks (from the date of receipt of order) to the pollution regulators’ panel to come up with an apportionment of compensation and utilisation plan for the same. The bench held that “by combination of negligent acts, respondent no. 1 (Gokhale Landmarks) and respondent no. 2 (PMC) had caused environmental damage.” It said the two must be held jointly and severally responsible for such damage. On February 10, 2021, an NGT-assigned joint inspection committee of the PMC and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) experts submitted a report stating that due to damage of trunk line and chamber (first on June 27, 2019, and later again on April 27, 2020), raw sewage had flown into Mutha river first for 86 days and later again for 115 days. Architect Sarang Yadvadkar, one of the five applicants who moved the NGT in the matter, told TOI, “In terms of quantity, close to 20.24 millions of litre per day (MLD) or 2,024 tankers of untreated raw sewage is estimated to have flown per day into the nullah/river.” Lawyer Manasi Joshi, who represented the MPCB, said on Friday, “The environmental compensation will be worked out on a per day violation basis for the 86 days and 115 days, in accordance with a formula laid down by the principal bench of the NGT in an earlier judgment.” Lawyer Pralhad Paranjape, who represented Gokhale Landmarks, said, “As per our interpretation of the ruling, the NGT has accepted the fact that it is the PMC’s responsibility and duty to maintain the drainage and that it did not inform us (about the presence of sewage line at the time of giving NOC to the project).”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ngt-panel-to-fix-fine-on-realtor-civic-body/articleshow/87376832.cms||Vishwas Kothari

This includes Rs18 lakh cash and 7.3kg gold ornaments. “The gang was to strike on October 20, but dropped the idea due to the gram sabha meeting,” Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police (Pune rural) said. The arrested suspects included — the kingpin Dollar alias Pravin Ovhal (29) of Khed, Ankur Pabale (24) of Junnar, Dhondiba Jadhav (29), Adinath Pathare (25) both of Parner in Ahmednagar district and Vikas Gunjal (20) of Shirur. On October 21, the gang armed with pistols had barged into the bank and robbed valuables worth Rs2.8 crore after threatening the manager and cashier. They had used a sedan car to escape with the loot. Later, they shifted to another car. Deshmukh said 10 teams of local police and crime branch were fanned for the probe. “Our team tracked the car by checking CCTV camera footage till Ahmednagar MIDC. We also got the gang kingpin ‘s name,” Deshmukh said. The police got a tip-off that Ovhal had fled to Madhya Pradesh. “When our team reached there, they got to know Ohval had returned and was in Nighoj, Ahmednagar. We laid a trap and took him into custody. He admitted to his involvement in the robbery and also revealed the names of his four accomplices, who were taken into custody,” he said. Deshmukh said the suspects had hidden the gold ornaments in a sugarcane farm at Nighoj. Deshmukh said Ovhal and the other four suspects were friends. Ovhal, Pabale and Jadhav have cases filed against them with the Pune rural police. “Ohval had decided to rob the bank at Pimparkhed as it was on the border of Pune and Ahmednagar districts and it was easy for them to flee. The branch did not have security guards, siren or even a hotline to contact the police,” he said. Ovhal went to MP and procured three country-made pistols. He borrowed a car from his acquaintance. “He had changed its colour and had arranged for another car to divert the police probe,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh said the police recovered over 90% of the robbed booty. “The gold ornaments robbed by the suspects were mainly of the local farmers, who had obtained a loan from the bank by mortgaging it,” Deshmukh said. He said that the suspects wanted to spend the robbed ornaments on merry making. The officer said that the police were yet to recover the firearms and two cars used by the suspects, he said. “The probe revealed that they had taken the sedan car to MP to change its colour again,” Deshmukh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/5-held-in-bank-dacoity-case-valuables-worth-rs-2-2cr-seized/articleshow/87376922.cms||Mihir Tanksale

As Covid-19 cases have dropped significantly, the demand has doubled in comparison to last festival season that was affected by the first wave of the pandemic. While idols made of terracotta and plaster of Paris are in great demand, many people are also opting for idols made of eco-friendly material. “The market is promising this year. Rains last week disturbed our preparation. As a result, we are still chasing the targets,” said Kuldeep Prajapati, an idol maker in the old city. Rahul Rajpoot, owner of an idol making store, said, “Plaster of Paris is in demand because it is comparatively inexpensive. In comparison to the sale of about 8000 idols last year, this year we have already sold over 15000 idols so far.” Ramesh Nath Prajapati, who makes idols at his home along with family, said, “Last year was really tough for all of us but this season we are looking forward to a better income.” Mukul Jaiswal, a street side shop owner in Bhootnath market, said, “This year, I bought about 1000 small idols made of terracotta and Plaster of Paris in comparison to last year’s 500.” “I have products ranging between Rs 200 to Rs 15000. A special attraction at my shop is the idols of Lakshmi and Ganesha sitting on a beautifully decorated boat,” said Nikhil Jaiswal. Chandra Rai, a customer said, “I will be buying a small terracotta idol because the ones with less or no decorations are more environmentally-friendly.” “I love buying the most colourful and decorated idol every year. I will prefer to buy the one made up of Plaster of Paris because it is cost effective,” said Asha Kumari, a customer. Neelam Singh, an advocate said, “I will buy a terracotta idol and I advise people to worship the eco-friendly version of idols only.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ganesh-lakshmi-idols-attract-buyers/articleshow/87379345.cms||---

The prosecution sought time from the court to seek clarification from the investigating officer of the women’s cell police station. On July 25, Auda Viegas from Bailancho Ekvott had lodged a complaint that the accused had threatened, assaulted and then raped two girls while impersonating police personnel. The accused had demanded a ransom of Rs 40,000 threatening to circulate the video of the victims being raped if their demand was not met. As one survivor was a minor, a chargesheet was filed in the Children’s Court. In the case of the other, a chargesheet was filed in the Margao sessions court. The accused has also assaulted the two male friends of the survivors with a fishing rod and threatened them with dire consequences. A few hours later, Yabbal had called one of the male friends and demanded a ransom. Based on the phone number, police had managed to crack the case within 24 hours.

---||Chandigarh||In a first, farmers let Bhupinder Singh Hooda share stage in Uchana Kalan||JIND: With the passage of time in the past over 11 months of the ongoing farmers’ protest against the three farm laws, farmers have now changed their tactics to deal with the Modi-led NDA government. On Friday, they allowed former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda to address the farmers from their stage for the first time in Uchana Kalan town, called banger area, a stronghold of farmers’ protest since Day 1. The town is represented by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. Notably, farmers had never allowed any leader to address them. In his address, Hooda extended his support to them. He assured to take up issues of low MSP, loss assessment and farmers’ laws with the BJP-JJP coalition government strongly. The leader of the opposition visited the waterlogged area in Julana town to take stock of the situation on Friday. Hooda visited Julana Anaj mandi as well and took stock of the crop procurement. He said farmers are reaching the mandis with paddy in large quantities, but the government is not procuring the same. “Sometimes, the farmers are refused on the pretext of high moisture or unclean paddy. The government is giving new pain every day to the farmers by imposing various conditions on MSP, manure, seed and moisture,” he said. “I have visited several mandis of the state, including Julana, and the story is the same everywhere as farmers are forced to sell their crop to private agencies at a rate lower than the MSP. Almost every crop, including paddy, bajra, maize, is being sold at low rates in the mandis,” he noted. Hooda also took stock of waterlogging in the fields of Poli village in Julana where farmers said large areas were waterlogged due to heavy rains in the past. “Standing crop in the field got ruined, but the government has neither compensated them nor made any arrangement to drain out water. The sowing of the Rabi season has started, but the farmers of this area are unable to sow the crop,” he said. Talking to TOI, Jind BKU president Azad Palwan, who is leading the protest, said, “We have been sitting on a dharna for around a year, but the Modi-led government is mum and hatching conspiracies to split the protest rather than speaking with farmers. Now, we would allow political leaders affiliated to various political outfits to address us too, so that they can raise our voice in a better way. If one come to extend his support, he or she would be welcomed here at our protest site in future. Leaders are welcome to visit here, so that they can mount pressure on BJP-JJP government too to demand repeal of farm laws,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/a-first-farmers-allow-hooda-to-share-stage-in-uchana-kalan/articleshow/87379353.cms||---

She garlanded the statue of Thevar at Goripalayam junction around 8 am on Friday amid drizzle while cadres handed over roses to be strewn on the statue. AMMK cadres with party flags lined up on both sides of the road all along the two kilometres from the hotel on Alagarkoil road to Goripalayam. Sasikala, who was accompanied by Forward Bloc general secretary Dr Ganeshan and Tamil Nadu Muslim League founder-president V M Mustafa, waved to them from her vehicle. “It is like the skies are blessing her,’ said Sandhanam, a party worker. After garlanding the statue of Thevar, Sasikala and her entourage went to Mariamman Teppakulam where she garlanded the statue of Marudhupandiar brothers as part of their 220th guru puja. Special pujas were performed as many women from AIADMK also welcomed her at Teppakulam. On her way to Pasumpon village in Ramanathapuram district, some posters put up at Paramakudi by a group of people who called themselves “OPS Peravai” attracted attention. They described Sasikala as the permanent general secretary of AIADMK and former CM O Panneerselvam as the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

---||Nagpur||HC grants 15 days to Patole, others to rectify election petition against Gadkari||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday granted 15 days to Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole and others to remove discrepancies from their affidavits filed with the election petition challenging Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “I am inclined to grant an opportunity to the petitioners to cure defects in affidavits filed under Form 25, by specifying on which averments in their petition are true to their knowledge and which part of the allegations made are true to their information,” justice Atul Chandurkar said. The HC was hearing a plea by losing candidates, including Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Sagar Dabarase and Nafiz Khan, besides Patole, who claimed that Gadkari, who contested on the BJP ticket, had flouted Representation of People’s Act 1951. “It is beyond any pale of doubt that the allegations of corrupt practice made in the petition have to be supported by an affidavit as required in Form 25 and Rule 94-A of the Rules of 1961. The affidavit must clearly indicate which part of the allegations are true to the knowledge of the deponent,” the judge said. “Stating the allegations to be true to one’s knowledge and information in the same breath has not been found to be acceptable. At the same time, it is equally well settled that a defect in verification or in the affidavit as filed is curable, and an opportunity deserves to be given to the petitioner to remove the same,” he added. According to the petitioners, the concerned returning officer (RO) of Nagpur parliamentary constituency improperly accepted Gadkari’s nomination form where he had deliberately not disclosed the entire information, to mislead the voters. They claimed that he allegedly suppressed material information which is required in the affidavit in Form-26 given as per Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and Rule 4-A. They said the respondent had concealed material information and supplied false one.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-grants-15-days-to-patole-others-to-rectify-election-petition-against-gadkari/articleshow/87376900.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Dehradun||Govt claims U’kand charging ‘lowest’ MBBS fee in country||Dehradun: With government, at a cabinet meeting held late on Thursday, deciding to slash MBBS fee in government colleges, Uttarakhand has become the state offering medical education at the lowest rates in the country, claimed state government spokesperson and agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal. "For an MBBS course, in a government college, a student has to pay Rs 4 lakh per annum. Uttarakhand government has brought the fee down to Rs 1.45 lakh now. Those furnishing a bond to serve in the state for five years after the completion of course will have to pay only Rs 50,000 per year," Uniyal said. He added, "Previously, the lowest fee being charged from govt medical students was in Punjab, where a student had to pay Rs 1.50 lakh for the first year and thereafter, it was raised by 15 per cent per year for the remaining period of the course." The government spokesperson further added that a state team had studied the fee structure in other states and found that Punjab was charging the lowest amount in state medical colleges. "Following which, we decided to lower the rates even further as it will be a major help to people pursuing the course," the minister added. Uttarakhand also offers the concept of submitting a "bond" to the medical students. According to which, they are required to serve in the state for a period of five years after the completion of the course. The provisions of the bond mention that in the first year, the doctor will have to serve in a medical college. For the next two years, the doctor would be required to serve in a primary health centre in a remote location of Uttarakhand and thereafter, work in a district hospital or a hospital in a far-flung area for a period of two years. Students submitting the bond will be required to pay an annual fee of Rs 50,000 for MBBS. Earlier, all medical colleges of Uttarakhand had a provision of offering bonds to students and the fee charged was Rs 50,000 per year. However, during the tenure of Trivendra Singh Rawat, the norms were changed and the bond was offered only in medical colleges situated in the hills like Srinagar Medical College. However, making a change, the cabinet has now decided to offer the condition of bond in other medical colleges of the state like Doon Medical College and Haldwani Medical College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/govt-claims-ukand-charging-lowest-mbbs-fee-in-country/articleshow/87376879.cms||---

The event was conducted as a part of the ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’, which is being celebrated to mark the victory of the Indian armed forces in the 1971 war against Pakistan. On June 13, 1971, as many as 349 cadets passed out of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehradun. Within six months of commissioning, they were deployed in the 1971 war. For this reason, the 47th regular and the 31st technical course have been dubbed as the “Born to Battle” course. Four officers of the course attained martyrdom in the war. Among them was Lieutenant Arun Khetrapal, who was posthumously bestowed with the prestigious Param Vir Chakra award. Lieutenant General Dalip Bhardwaj (retired), said, “Arun was in the Fox squadron, and and under his watch, Fox became the champion squadron. In our final term at the Indian Military Academy, Arun was given the privilege of carrying the president’s colours.” He said in Oct 1971, fourteen officers who were commissioned to the Armoured Corps arrived at Ahmednagar for Young Officers (YO) course.  “However, within a few days, we were informed of the imminent commencement of hostilities and our regiments needed us,” he added. “It was Arun who shouldered that responsibility and led his tank troop from the front. He laid down his life for the honour of the nation and Poona Horse,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/veterans-from-the-born-to-battle-course-pay-tribute-to-war-heroes/articleshow/87376889.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Bareilly||Will go to court, not govt, if farmers harassed at procurement centres: Varun Gandhi||BAREILLY: BJP MP Varun Gandhi during a surprise visit at a local paddy procurement centre in his constituency Pilibhit on Friday publicly reprimanded the centre in-charge over problems being faced by farmers. “Every centre will have a representative of mine who will record all the activities and in case any cruelty or corruption is found, I'll not approach the government, but instead produce the evidence in court and ensure those guilty are sent to jail,” he said. In a video shared on his Twitter timeline on Friday morning, Gandhi can be seen telling officials, “A farmer in Mohammadi recently set his paddy crop on fire. Similar incidents were reported from 17 districts, including Pilibhit. A farmer setting his yield on fire is a matter of shame for the state and the country." Gandhi, who is on a two-day visit to his constituency, has been increasingly vocal about farmers' issues such as fertiliser shortage and slow sale of foodgrains. When asked about the paddy procurement problem in the state, he told TOI, “At every centre in UP, there is crippling corruption. Farmers’ grains are forcibly rejected. Out of desperation, they are selling to middlemen at an extremely low price. The administration also takes a cut. This kind of situation will drive the next generation away from agriculture and threaten both our food and national security. It will also lead to social unrest.” The BJP leader has also been vocal about the minimum support price (MSP) for crops. In the video shared on Twitter on Friday, he can be heard saying, "Till there is no statutory guarantee of MSP, farmers will continue to be exploited in mandis. They are forced to contact the middlemen and sell their paddy at Rs 1,100-Rs 1,200 only while the MSP is Rs 1,940. The nexus is clearly visible. Why do you (officials) want to take the curse of millions of farmers? They are already broken.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/will-go-to-court-not-govt-if-farmers-harassed-at-procurement-centres-varun-gandhi/articleshow/87376914.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Madurai||DMK panchayat union chairperson resigns following feud||Tenkasi: M Chellammal, the chairperson of Kadayam panchayat union in Tenkasi resigned from her post a week after she was elected in the indirect polls held on October 22. Party feud is cited to be the reason behind her resignation as she had defeated the candidate fielded by the DMK for the top position in the panchayat union that is reserved for dalits. This caused embarrassment to the district and local party functionaries. Chellammal was elected as the councillor of ward no. 11 in Kadayam union in the direct election earlier this month, as she defeated her competitor by a margin of nearly 1,500 votes. The party had fielded Jayakumar the councillor of ward no. 13 for the post of the panchayat union with 17 councillors.DMK had 11 councillors, followed by AIADMK (5) and Congress (1), thereby giving the ruling party the confidence that their official candidate Jayakumar, who switched from Puthiya Tamilagam to DMK last year, will win the indirect polls on October 22. However, Chellammal took the party by shock and surprise by bagging 13 votes, including those of the AIADMK councillors.Jayakumar secured just four votes. Unhappy over the turn of events, the local DMK unit placed the party’s Kadayam union secretary Kumar under suspension, suspecting that he helped Chellammal defeat Jayakumar. Under these circumstances, Chellammal on Friday evening submitted her resignation letter to the personal assistant of the Tenkasi district collector.Chellammal and her husband Murugan refused to talk to reporters and stated that they have mentioned the reason in the resignation letter. Tenkasi south district unit secretary of the DMK Sivapadmanabhan could not be reached for comment. Officials said that another indirect poll would be conducted to elect the union chairperson if the resignation of Chellammal is accepted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/dmk-panchayat-union-chairperson-resigns-following-feud/articleshow/87378353.cms||---

On his 26thday in a cell and his hopes pinned on paperwork, Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, had to contend with one more night in a jail barrack, though not of uncertainty, report Swati Deshpande & Rebecca Samervel. Justice Nitin Sambre had on Thursday granted bail to Khan (23), his friend Arbaaz Merchant (26) and Munmun Dhamecha (28). Aryan’s advocate said he would be released shortly after 7am on Saturday Weekly 3-hour attendance at NCB office a condition for bailAryan Khan had to spend one more night in a jail barrack on Friday. The bail amount and conditions for him, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were common. He will be released Saturday morning, said his lawyer. Within an hour of the HC order being uploaded, at around 4.30pm, Juhi Chawla, a co-star of his father in some films, arrived at sessions court to stand as surety for Aryan. Dressed in a white salwar with bluish grey duppata, her eyes twinkling despite a black mask as she obliged court staff with selfies, she signed the Rs 1 lakh bond for the bail. After her arrival, Khan’s legal team had apparently an hour’s window before it could submit the release order—to be placed in a sealed cover—at the drop box outside Arthur Road jail. Aryan, whose bail formalities from the sessions court end then got completed, missed the jail ‘deadline’ of 5.30pm. His lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, “In view of the system and procedural lacuna, he will have to spend one more night in jail.” “There is a procedural lacuna in our system that even though we got the HC bail order 3.30pm and though we are in the electronic age, we have to follow the archaic system of taking the physical copy from HC to the special NDPS court, where the designated judge, after examining the authenticated copy, accepts the surety and his or her solvency certificate if any, issued by a tehsildar,” said Maneshinde. Khan’s team had come prepared with Chawla’s solvency certificate to show she was solvent for Rs 1 lakh. The judge accepted her as surety. Following his order granting bail, Justice Nitin Sambre on Friday set out 14 stringent bail conditions including immediate surrender of passport, a weekly three-hour attendance at the NCB office, no statements to media, the requirement to join in the investigation when called upon to do so and not to delay the trial once it starts. Following Covid protocols, after verifying Chawla’s identity and other documents, cops posted outside gate number six of sessions court permitted her to enter the premises. Accompanied by lawyers from Aryan’s legal team, she made her way to the special NDPS court No 44 on the first floor. Introducing Chawla to court, Maneshinde said she has been professionally associated with Shah Rukh Khan and knows Aryan since he was born. Chawla stood in the witness box. Special judge V V Patil, who had last week rejected Aryan’s bail plea, asked her for her name and who she was appearing for. “Juhi Chawla Mehta,” the actor said. The court verified her documents that included her Aadhar card and passport. Chawla then made her way to the third floor where further formalities were completed in the registrar’s office. She was made to sign certain documents. A huge crowd of litigants, lawyers and court staff gathered outside the office to catch a glimpse. Lawyers of other litigants waiting for their formalities to be completed expressed their displeasure. Chawla then went back to the courtroom. The court registry prepared the bail bond after seeing the special court’s acceptance of her surety. The papers are sent to the special judge to append his signature on the bond, after which the document is sealed with the court’s seal and thereafter, the packet containing the order in a sealed cover is sent to the jailor, said Maneshinde. The norm followed in Maharashtra is that a jailor accepts the court paper for release on bail, only via a drop box placed outside the prison, which is opened at regular intervals four times a day: at 7am, midday, 3.30pm and last at 5.30pm, Maneshinde said. But the jail manual requires all inmates to be sent inside barracks at 6pm and barracks are sealed and locked, he said. Headcount of inmates starts at 5pm inside the barracks. Chawla left the court a little after 6pm. The order of bail, meanwhile, said the trio cannot tamper with the probe, cannot indulge in any similar activities on the basis of which the case was registered under the NDPS Act and cannot try to establish communication with co-accused or any other person involved in similar activities as alleged. If they violate any of the 14 terms, NCB shall be entitled to apply to special court for cancellation of bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-weekly-3-hour-attendance-at-ncb-office-a-condition-for-bail/articleshow/87379371.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Coimbatore||In a first, NIB-CID recruits labrador puppies to sniff out narcotic drugs||COIMBATORE: For the first time in its history, the narcotics intelligence bureau-crime investigation department (NIB-CID) has decided to use drug-sniffing dogs. The bureau has received three labrador puppies, which will be deployed at its Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy units after undergoing training at the Detective Dog Training Centre in Coimbatore city. “We bought the 51-day old puppies from Coonoor on October 23. Tiger will be deployed in Coimbatore, Pandi in Madurai and Bond in Trichy,” said an official. Two handlers each from Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy city police have been appointed to take care of the puppies. “The handlers will teach them basic obedience cues. When they are nine months old, they will begin intensive training to detect drugs. The dogs will be deployed after completing the training. Handlers will take them to railway stations to check baggage of passengers to find ganja and other drugs,” the official added. Police are currently using sniffer dogs that can detect explosives. Tracking dogs play an important role in cracking burglary cases and murders. Only a few city police units have sniffer dogs that can detect drugs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/in-a-first-nib-cid-recruits-labrador-puppies-to-sniff-out-narcotic-drugs/articleshow/87378360.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Pumpset makers slash production||Coimbatore: In a cascading effect triggered by the pandemic, pumpset manufactures in the district are struggling to tide over the escalating cost of raw materials over the last one year which has doubled the cost of production.The rising cost of raw materials has forced the manufacturers to cut down the production and downsize the workforce by one third.Till a few years, back, Coimbatore was manufacturing about 60% of the total pumpsets manufactured in the country. However, the market share has come down for the 400-odd manufacturers in the district in recent years.“Till last year, pumpset manufacturing in Coimbatore was valued at Rs 7,000 crore out of the total market share of Rs 15,000-Rs 17,000 in the country. It has now come down to less than Rs 4,000c crore,” said Ma Senthil Kumar, from Supertech Industries.“Due to this reduced demand, pumpset manufacturers are working at only 40% of their capacities and downsized one-third of their workforce. The industry was offering jobs to 1.5 lakh people. 50,000 of them have already lost their jobs in the last one year. Most of the units may not be able to pay bonuses to their employees this Diwali,” he said.The cost of pumpsets ranged between Rs 2,000 and Rs 40,000 till last year based on its capacity. The pumpset selling for Rs 40,000 now costs more than Rs 60,000 while those selling for Rs 10,000 costs Rs 15,000. Manufacturers say the input costs have doubled but they hiked selling prices only to an extent instead of completely transferring the entire burden to the customers. While the cost of raw material has doubled but manufacturers could not double the cost of pumps as the demand is low.“Usually, the cost of pumps is increased once in every 2-3 years but an unprecedented rise in the cost of raw material has forced the manufacturers to increase the price on multiple occasions,” said K V Karthik, President of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers' Association (SIEMA).For farmers, the major users of pumpsets, costs of drilling and installing a bore well pump have more than doubled in a year. This huge increase in cost has delayed the procurement and installation of pumpsets. As a result, the demand for pumps has significantly reduced in the market, he said.The pumpset manufacturers have urged the Centre to curb the export of steel to bring down the cost of it, which will ease the pump industry in Coimbatore.Karthik said the profit margins of big steel companies have increased exponentially as they capitalize on the high cost of steel by exporting it.“But the escalating cost of steel and other raw material has been adversely affecting the MSMEs. The Centre must consider curbs on the export of steel by at least 50% to bring down its escalating cost,” Karthik said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pumpset-makers-slash-production/articleshow/87378363.cms||---

"Earlier, these problems were common among aged people but now these diseases are catching people at a young age," said director of Extra Care Physiotherapy Centre, Dr Akanksha Upadhyay. "Physiotherapy has shown positive results in patients after stroke but timing plays a crucial role. The first three months after stroke are considered as 'golden time' for recovery," she said. Chief consultant neurophysiotherapist Dr Santosh Kumar Upadhyay said new technology, machines and manual techniques could bring about a positive change in the daily lives of stroke patients. "Muscular imbalance is seen in patients as half of the body gets paralysed which leads to postural changes. With the help of postural analysis lab, the posture is assessed and the exercise programme is assessed accordingly," he said. At least 105 patients attended the special camp.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/physiotheraphy-aid-within-3-mths-key-to-recovery-after-stroke/articleshow/87379369.cms||---

Other parts in the city recorded relatively higher minimum temperatures on Friday morning, with 16.4C in Lohegaon, 15.2C in Pashan, 19.7C in Chinchwad, 18.1C in Lavale and 20.5C in Magarpatta. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI, “The drop in minimum was due to mainly clear skies on Thursday night and early Friday morning associated with north-easterly/easterly wind. Less cloud cover in the night aids in easy escape of the long wave radiation from the earth’s surface to the atmosphere, giving a cooling effect near the surface region.” He, however, said the relatively low night temperature in some parts of the state might be short lived as isolated light rain was expected in Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra soon. Kashyapi said, “The end of the first post-monsoon month has arrived and no strong rain causing system is present near Maharashtra. However, a low-pressure area has formed over Southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Sri Lanka off Tamil Nadu coast. It is likely to move westwards during next 3-4 day. This system is causing easterly winds to penetrate the southern parts of Maharashtra.” “In the city, cloud amount is likely to rise from November 1-4, with generally cloudy conditions in afternoon. There could be very light to light rain in Pune during afternoon /evening time from November 1-4 , accompanied with thundery activity,” Kashyapi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/minimum-temp-below-15c-in-shivajinagar/articleshow/87376941.cms||Neha Madaan

The injured Vinod Ambadekar, who works as traffic controller with Travel Time (one of the Red bus operators), suffered damage to one of his eyes in the attack. An official from Aapli Bus programme manager — Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Ltd confirmed the incident and said the attack took place after Ambadekar objected to autorickshaw drivers blocking the route of city buses on Maharajbagh Road on Wednesday afternoon. Ambadekar’s objection did not go down well with a group of autorickshaw drivers. One of them got very agitated and threatened Red bus staffers of dire consequences. He, however, left the place soon after. “On Wednesday night, the autorickshaw driver returned along with three to five accomplices. They allegedly abused Ambadekar, pinned him down and started raining blows on him,” said the official. As passengers and other staff intervened, taking advantage of the melee, the assailants fled the scene. Ambadekar was rushed to Mure Memorial Hospital with serious injuries to his left eye and head. He was later shifted to ESIC Hospital. As the hospital did not have any ophthalmologist, Ambadekar was referred to a private hospital. Though his condition is stable, retina of his left eye has been severely damaged, said the doctor’s report. Later, Travel Time and DIMTS filed complaints with Sitabuldi police on Thursday night. The police have recorded the statement of Ambadekar. On the basis of the complaints, Sitabuldi police have started investigation to nab the unidentified attackers. No arrests were made till the filing of the report. The bus drivers and conductors alleged that police did not take serious cognisance of their earlier complaints which was one of the reasons for the rise in attacks on Aapli Bus staff. On Friday, TOI visited Maharajbagh Road and found autorickshaw drivers parking their vehicles in front of buses and even trying to pull bus commuters into their vehicles. Aapli Bus staff further alleged that their complaints even to traffic police fell on deaf ears. Under the patronage of traffic police, the autorickshaw drivers have a free run at many busy places in Sitabuldi, including Maharajbagh Road, Variety Square, Rani Jhansi Square and Munje Chowk, they claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/aapli-bus-staff-nearly-loses-eye-in-attack-by-auto-driver-aides/articleshow/87376940.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Coimbatore||91 marriage halls in dist get nod to set up cracker shops||Coimbatore: The fire and rescue services department has given nod to set up temporary shops on the premises of 91 marriage halls in the district to sell firecrackers till Diwali.It is to be noted that former district fire officer R Jegadheesh, who was transferred to the Nilgiris recently, hadn’t provided permission to set up cracker shops at the marriage halls, considering the safety aspects.Now, the Namakkal district fire officer, who is holding the additional charge of Coimbatore, has given the nod to set up cracker shops at the 91 marriage halls. The shops, however, could be set up only in open areas and there is no permission to use the marriage hall building for the purpose.Sources with the district fire and rescue services department said Jegatheesh was shunted out to the Nilgiris for denying permission to set up temporary cracker shops on the premises of marriage halls.A senior fire and rescue services department official said they had received 703 applications from across the district this year, seeking permission to set up temporary cracker shops.“Permission is usually given to set up temporary cracker shops in an area not exceeding 270sqft. However, marriage halls in general have more than 4,000sqft area and this was the main reason for denying permission to set up shops there. There are chances of making use of the excess space in marriage halls to store crackers in large quantities. Since they could accommodate more customers, casualties will be more in case of any accidents. Jegadheesh had cited this as a reason to deny permission to set up shops at marriage halls,” the officer said.After a fire broke out in a grocery shop selling crackers at Sankarapuram in Kallakurichi district claiming seven lives, the official said, there was a need to take precautionary measures to prevent similar incidents. “People setting up shops at marriage halls should not be allowed to stock crackers in the hall. They should not also allow large crowds to throng the shops.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/91-marriage-halls-in-dist-get-nod-to-set-up-cracker-shops/articleshow/87378361.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Farmers flay industrial park project, petition collector||Coimbatore: More than 200 farmers from Annur and Mettupalayam taluks on Friday petitioned district collector G S Sameeran not to proceed with the proposed Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO)’s industrial park project, for which 3,800 acres land was identified in their area for acquisition. A few months ago, TIDCO officials from Chennai had visited Akkaraisengampalli, Kuppanur, Pogalur and Vadakkalur villages in Annur taluk, and Iluppanatham and Bellepalayam villages in Mettupalayam taluk and surveyed the land for the project. Stating that most of the land parcels in the two taluks were owned by small scale farmers, who were dependent on the same for their livelihoods, the farmers on Friday urged the collector to look for land elsewhere.They gathered at the collectorate in the morning and sat in front of the collector office building till Sameeran arrived there at 11am. After listening to their grievances, the collector received petitions from each farmer.Many farmers turned emotional while airing their grievances to the collector and broke into tears. While some of them tried to prostrate before the collector, the collectorate staff prevented them from doing so. S Palanisamy, a farmer from Vakkanamkombu, said he only knew farming to make a living. “If my land is taken away from me, I will lose my livelihood. I want to safeguard my land and pass it on to the next generation.” Palanisamy said he had cultivated maize on his land.Most of the farmers were accompanied by their young sons and daughters, who were graduates and wanted to take up farming. They said they could modernize agriculture and be successful farmers. “We hardly get any employment. Even if we get a job, the salary will be less.” J Rajkumar, an MSc computer science graduate, said he used to help his parents with farming activities. “Now, I want to take up farming as a full-time job. We own 2.5 acres land and it is the only source of income for us. We do not want to lose the land.” The collector said the entire project proposal was only on its initial stages. “Presently, only survey work has been completed. I will bring the farmers’ opposition to the project to the notice of the state government.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/farmers-flay-industrial-park-project-petition-collector/articleshow/87378374.cms||---

G Ganesan, a farmer from Annur, said his cows were often developing health problems after eating plastic bags that were dumped on grazing land. “Cattle often eat leftover food and sambar in plastic bags and develop health problems. We have no other option, but to spend a lot of money to treat the livestock.” Another farmer said the plastic waste was also clogging irrigation canals. “The menace had come down when the ban was enforced strictly before the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. Now that the officials are not taking it seriously, traders and hoteliers are using the banned plastic items generously.” The farmers also opposed the national highways department’s plan to lay a bypass road through Annur and suggested other options like construction of a flyover at Kinathukadavu and expansion of Sathy-Coimbatore Road. They demanded the forest department to enhance compensation for the crops damaged in wild animal raids and pest attacks. “While we lose a large chunk of crops to wild animal raids, we are never adequately compensated.” District forest officer T K Ashok Kumar told the farmers that they had received Rs 1.59 crore from the state government and they would be compensated soon. He said they had requested the government to make an allocation of Rs 3 crore a year to compensate farmers for their crop losses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/farmers-urge-officials-to-enforce-ban-on-single-use-plastic/articleshow/87378377.cms||---

A police source said the dog started unleashing terror by around 5pm, when it started chasing people and biting them on Sathy Road. Head constable Ponmani, who was on duty on Sathy Road, was among the dog’s first few targets. “After she informed her higher officials, police and health department officials started looking for the dog.” A health official with Annur town panchayat said the dog had bitten 11 people by 8pm. “They visited the Annur government hospital and took injections.” He said they had deployed a dog catching team with vehicle immediately after they came to know about the stray dog attack. “They tracked the dog till Nariampalli village, which is on the Coimbatore-Tirupur border. Since the dog entered Tirupur district, the team returned empty-handed.” Local residents, meanwhile, said the stray dog menace had increased at Annur and neighbouring villages in the past few months. “However, a dog biting so many people in a few hours is something new in recent times,” said a resident. The health official said they were equipped with a dog catching squad and vehicle to immediately address stray dog menace complaints from the residents. “While stray dogs are being sterilized, they are left in the same location after the process.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/stray-dog-turns-violent-bites-11-people-in-3-hrs/articleshow/87378371.cms||---

As per the new notification issued on Thursday, the district magistrates of nine non-attainment cities shall take special precautions after taking into account ambient air quality of the cities concerned and will pass appropriate orders for compliance of the orders of Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT). In the earlier notification issued on Tuesday by the department of science, technology & environment, the sale and use of any kind of crackers was prohibited in Mandi Gobindgarh and Jalandhar from midnight of October 28-29 to midnight of December 31 this year to January 1, 2022 following NGT order of 2020 as the average air quality index for the month of November last year had remained under poor category in both these cities.On Wednesday, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi in Ludhiana had claimed that while he used to study, he himself had sold crackers and managed the expenses of his one year education with that income. He said willing shopkeepers must be allowed to sell crackers instead of being harassed by the police. The officials of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) revealed that nine cities — Mandi Gobindgarh, Dera Baba Nanak, Patiala, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Dera Bassi, Naya Nangal and Khanna — falls under non-attainment zone. These cities have been declared as ‘non-attainment’ by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) based on air pollution recorded in the last five years. These cities could not attain their air quality up to the mark. PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg said, “The window for two hours for only green crackers have been allowed for sale and use of firecrackers across the state while the manufacturing, sale and use of joined crackers (series of crackers) or firecrackers that use barium salts or compounds of antimony, lithium, mercury arsenic, lead or strontium, chromate in the manufacture of fireworks are prohibited.” The principal secretary, department of science, technology & environment, said, “It’s a comprehensive and balanced order in accordance with the norms and the selling and usage of only green crackers has been allowed across Punjab. The respective district magistrates of nine non-attainment cities shall take special precautions and will pass orders for compliance. In the earlier notification we had missed to add this paragraph.” In Punjab, the bursting of green firecrackers has been allowed on Diwali (November 4) from 8pm to 10pm; on Gurpurb (November 19) from 4am to 5am and from 9pm to 10pm; on Christmas Eve (December 25-26) from 11.55pm till 12.30am and on New Year Eve (December 31, 2021 to January 1, 2022) from 11.55pm to 12.30am. The district officials in Fatehgarh Sahib had recently carried out a lucky draw for the applicants willing to sell firecrackers and around 2,600 applicants had applied in the district of which 26 traders from across the district, including four traders from Mandi Gobindgarh, had won licences but the same were not issued by the authorities in Mandi Gobindgarh after state pollution department had issued prohibition orders. “Earlier we had decided not to issue licence to traders in Mandi Gobindgarh following prohibition orders; however we would issue the licences if the government had allowed the same,” said deputy commissioner Fatehgarh Sahib Surbhi Malik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ban-of-firecracker-lifted-in-jalandhar-mandi-gobindgarh/articleshow/87378376.cms||Bharat Khanna

The company has Pushkar Mukewar as its CEO. He has been camping in Nagpur since over a year due to Covid and carrying out the work from here. He is also a co-founder of Drip Capital. The new funding comes from Barclays Investment Bank as well as East West Bank. The San Francisco based fintech company has raised $525 million of funding so far. Talking to TOI, Mukewar said the company was formed in 2016 and Drip Capital has a tech-based platform to provide solutions to small and mid-segment clients engaged in Exim business. Out of its total business of $2 billion dollars in funding global finance, 15% business is from exporters in central India. This include rice exports too, he said. Explaining the model, Mukewar said this is a type of bill discounting business. Exporters can register on the company’s platform. Based on the data analysis, Drip Capital discounts the invoices of the selected exporters. The invoice is further encashed by Drip Capital through its banking partners, earning a margin in the process. Drip Capital identifies itself as an overseas finance company. This also helps exporters discount and encash invoices before payment is due, he said. Out of the $175 million dollar funding and $40million in direct equity, the rest of the company borrowings in in the form of debt. Apart from India, the company also has business in Mexico and the US. With small and mid businesses as the target client, the company has been providing collateral free credit in this segment. The company has tie-up with banking partners as well as family-run entities, he said. Drip Capital will use the new funding to scale its business over the next 18 months. It will invest in products and technologies, and accelerate go-to-market in existing and new geographies like South Asia and Latin America. The company also plans to launch a new trade facilitation platform designed to alleviate the pain points of small businesses while collaborating with participants across the value chain, including shipping lines, payment processors, and insurance providers, said its press release. It currently works with over 3,500 sellers and buyers in over 80 countries. “The Covid-19 pandemic has put severe pressure on cash flows of exporters and importers alike. This strain is being felt most by SMBs, who have never had easy access to capital,” Mukewar said in the press release.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nagpurians-us-based-fin-co-gets-175-mn-funding/articleshow/87376962.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Delhi||Two new sectors in Narela to give a feel of Dwarka||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has been trying for many years to develop its Narela sub-city in north Delhi on the lines of the more popular Dwarka sub-city. As part of the initiative, the authority is now developing two new sectors from scratch with a project cost of around Rs 824.7 crore.An estimate approval committee of DDA okayed various development schemes, ranging from roads to drainage and security to electricity infrastructure, at sectors G2 and G6. The authority is building more than 20,000 flats in these two sectors, which would now see a major development of infrastructure. The infrastructure projects include a provision of Rs 245 crore as infrastructure charges for water supply and sewerage, and Rs 117 crore for developing storm water drains, apart from Rs 138 crore for establishing an electric grid sub-station for augmenting supply in the area. The approved schemes also include construction of a 10km-long and 20-metre-wide road in the area at a cost of Rs 50 crore. An almost equal allocation has been made for water supply lines and sewerage schemes, apart from provisions for streetlights and a boundary wall. DDA has also provisioned Rs 17 crore for a sewage treatment plant and is hopeful that these two sectors will be “zero-waste”. “Narela is a priority area for development and DDA is committed to develop it on the lines of Dwarka. In DDA’s annual budget 2021-22, a significant component of the expenditure was earmarked for the Narela sub-city development,” a DDA spokesperson said. Allocations were made in the budget for transport infrastructure projects such as grant of Rs 400 core to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for construction of Phase-IV Metro line on the Rithala-Bawana-Narela corridor. Allocations were also made for constructing the Urban Extension Road–II stretch in Delhi through National Highways Authority of India. “Besides, DDA is undertaking various residential projects in Narela,” the spokesperson said. In April this year, a nearly two-km-long, six-lane flyover-cum-rail overbridge (ROB) was inaugurated in Narela to provide smooth connectivity between densely populated Narela and Bawana, which are upcoming residential as well as industrial hubs in northwest Delhi. Earlier this year, the authority engaged a consultant to prepare a plan for the optimum utilisation of vacant land parcels in Narela. According to DDA sources, the consultant has already submitted the report and a plan will be finalised soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/two-new-sectors-in-narela-to-give-a-feel-of-dwarka/articleshow/87378387.cms||---

He also denied that there was a rave or drug party on the cruise liner Cordelia on October 2. Khan, who is an accused in a rape case registered by the Oshiwara police, denied knowing Wankhede. “I have never met Wankhede, nor do I have any connection with him, I have just heard about him in the news. I am a law- abiding citizen and am ready to give a statement to any authority/agency if they want to question me.” He said that till now, neither the NCB vigilance team nor the Special Investigation Team of Mumbai police have called him. One of Malik’s allegations against Wankhede has been that on the night of October 2, the NCB official and his team only arrested certain guests though there were 1,300 patrons on the ship, and Wankhede allegedly didn’t check Kashif Khan as he was a “friend” of Wankhede’s. Kashif Khan told TOI, “The organiser of the party was from a company in Delhi, we were just sponsors. You can even check with the cruise. It was just an entertainment event. I am surprised and shocked by the allegations made by minister Malik. I can only say that he has been completely misinformed and misled by whoever is giving him information.” Asked whether he will take any legal action against Malik, Khan said, “Malik sahib is a powerful minister, I won’t dare to do that as it will be a waste of time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-no-drugs-link-dont-know-wankhede-says-man-dubbed-organiser-by-min/articleshow/87379395.cms||Ahmed Ali

Residents have expressed concern and sought immediate remedial measures. Fire service department sources said that three vehicles parked near the pillars had caught fire. Scraps dumped underneath the bridge including flammable materials aggravated the fire that kept burning for hours. While the fire was extinguished from spreading further to adjoining residential and commercial buildings, two pillars bore the brunt. In the impact, cement plasters came off the pillars while the belly of the RoB’s deck witnessed substantial damage due to the high temperature. Residents said that with schools, government offices and complexes situated nearby, it may be catastrophic. “The RoB is accessed by thousands of people to reach the commercial streets near Main guard gate. The festive season has increased vehicular movement. The cracks must be studied properly,” Karthikeyan Sundaram, a resident said. An expert in civil engineering after examining the photographs of the damages said that repair works are imminent to ensure the stability of the RoB. A section of residents also criticised the civic body for the poor maintenance of the vacant space below RoBs across the city. “We will request faculty from NIT-Trichy to study the damaged pillars,” a corporation official said. It maybe recalled that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) had denied permission to the corporation to install an e-waste collection centre below the Thennur RoB, due to the vulnerability of fire accidents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/residents-concerned-over-damaged-pillars-of-thennur-rob-in-trichy/articleshow/87378399.cms||Deepak Karthik

A proposal in this regard has been sent to the health department. Nashik civil surgeon Ashok Thorat said, “Currently, there are very few patients admitted in the Covid wing of the hospital.

However, there is still a possibility of a third wave of the pandemic.” Thorat said that anticipating that children could be affected by the Covid-19 virus in the third wave, arrangements are being made to set up pediatric ICU. Similar, arrangements are also being made at Kalwan rural hospital and Malegaon general hospital, said senior officials. The medical machinery and instruments required for pediatric ICU are different than the general ICU and separate arrangements are being made. A pediatric ward has also been kept ready at Bytco Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/pediatric-icu-with-42-beds-to-come-up-in-covid-wing-of-nashik-civil-hospital/articleshow/87374185.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The cops could initially see only a wall behind the bed in a cramped room on the ground floor. It was after the minor pointed out, a portion of the wall was pulled down to discover a hollow opening which had a chamber behind where at least four minor girls can crawl into and stand. There was a similar concealed chamber at the end of a tunnel on the first floor too. Police officials feel that there could be inter-connected chambers too. When TOI visited the spot, there were some bangles and women footwear in one of the rooms leading to the secret chambers. “The chambers were closed and the walls had been painted recently. We feel the chambers were closed after the police started shutting down Ganga Jamuna following CP Amitesh Kumar’s order,” said senior I Parag Pote of Lakadganj police station. The minor, who helped the police to discover the chambers, was sold by some persons, including her mother, for Rs20 lakh in 2017. From her native place in Rajasthan she was taken to a dance bar in Mumbai. The minor was later taken to Gwalior after she changed hands for Rs20 lakh once again. She was once again sold for Rs 20 lakh and brought to Ganga Jamuna in 2020. The minor had befriended a customer who helped her flee from the place in the night. She had gone back to Rajasthan but her grandmother urged her to leave soon with her younger brother as the family was preparing to sell her once again. The minor had approached Lakadganj police station around a fortnight ago. Lakadganj police later went to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to nab the minor’s mother, a relative and another goon-turned-trafficker Mahendra Chhari who are now in police custody. More arrests are likely, said PI Pote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/17-yr-old-leads-cops-to-secret-chambers-at-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/87376995.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||I am a victim of northeast Delhi riots, told police about arson, claims Tahir Hussain||NEW DELHI: Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain claimed before a court on Friday that he was the “victim” of the northeast Delhi riots and the one who was dousing the fire, not setting it. The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Virender Bhatt during hearing of a case related to gunshot injuries sustained by one Ajay Kumar Jha allegedly by a riotous mob from Hussain’s house on February 25, 2020. Advocate Rizwan, appearing for Hussain, alleged that the conspiracy, as claimed by police, started from Jamia and ended at Chand Bagh. “In between, police have omitted many important events like speeches from some politicians,” he claimed. He further claimed that Hussain was not the one giving instructions to the rioters to hurl petrol bombs. “If you see the videos, he was the one who was trying to douse the fire in the parking lot near his home and not the one setting it on fire… The videos that were relied upon by the prosecution was shot by a local who was not made a witness,” Rizwan argued. The special public prosecutor (SPP), appearing for police, told the court that the person had changed his address and could not be traced. “This person is speaking about arson in the area and that he (Hussain) was the man behind it. This is the opinion of the neighbourhood,” he claimed. The SPP alleged that Hussain was not resisting, but assisting, the rioters. Rizwan played several videos in the court that showed Hussain speaking to the ACP concerned, while a huge police contingent was present near his house. “Hussain was apprising police about the riots… No one is willing to take this video on record. In fact, the witness, Pradeep, whose parking lot was burnt, indulged in stone pelting… I am the victim here. The witness... cannot be believed,” he said. Rizwan further argued that Hussain had never been in contact with former JNU student Umar Khalid, a co-accused. He played a video in which some of Hussain’s employees were trying to hold the door to his home and the rioters were allegedly trying to break in. Hussain’s home was targeted and he was later rescued by police, Rizwan said. When the prosecutor alleged that the videos were “staged”, Hussain’s lawyer said, “The prosecutor was trying to deceive the court… Police do not have any video of Hussain on February 25, when police made recoveries in the case… On February 24, he was rescued by police and the house’s possession was under police following his rescue.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/i-am-a-victim-of-ne-delhi-riots-told-police-about-arson-claims-hussain/articleshow/87378408.cms||Usha Das

Additional commissioner of police, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba, said a special team of the crime branch was keeping a close eye on the chain snatchers and their aides. "The accused arrested during the operation are some of the most notorious kingpins who presided over the chain-snatching networks which included their aides such as jewellers that purchased stolen golden chains," Lamba said. The accused were involved in 337 chain-snatching incidents that took place in the last three years in Jaipur. "Aides and beneficiaries are also under the scanner," he said. The crime branch said some of the accused had ties with gangs based in different cities and states. They also arranged local support for inter-state and inter-district criminals to run amok in the city. These gangs were plotting to reap windfalls during the festive season in the bustling markets of the city. "We had compiled a database of chain snatchers active in the city. Long operational planning preceded Friday raids," said DCP, crime, Amrita Duhan, who led the operation. "October is the peak season for chain snatchers. We have detained 42 accused and arrested 29 for their alleged involvement in multiple thefts," she said. According to Duhan, besides chain-snatching, some of the accused were also involved in stealing mobile phones and staged other thefts too. "The raids began at 5 am across 55 locations of Jaipur. The operation was kept a secret so that the accused could not get the whiff. We have recovered 10 two-wheelers, one rickshaw and 17 mobile phones," Duhan said. "Chain snatchers usually go dormant during winter months. For them, October is a peak season when footfall in markets increase exponentially because of the festivities," she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/chain-snatchers-gangs-busted-29-held-in-dawn-to-dusk-raids-ahead-of-diwali/articleshow/87378412.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Amit Shah reinforced ‘Bharatiyata’ in consciousness of people: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Terming home minister Amit Shah as a leader who reinforced ‘bharatiyata’, while putting welfare of poor, farmers, youth and women in BJP’s political agenda, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said, a robust organisational strength of the saffron outfit will hold the key to party’s electoral prospects in UP polls due in next few months. Crediting Shah for turning BJP into world’s largest political outfit, the chief minister exhorted party functionaries to leave “no stone unturned” to meet the target fixed by the party organisation for a grand electoral success. Yogi was speaking at an event to flag off BJP membership campaign by Shah. The event was attended by functionaries from Awadh region comprising 13 districts (86 assembly seats), including Ayodhya, the epicentre of Hindutva politics. “It’s the party worker who has been challenging divisive forces and defeating them to establish BJP as a strong political force,” he said. Yogi categorically credited Modi and Shah for removing a 500-year-old ‘kalank’ by ensuring construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. “Aaj har Bharatiya garv ki anubhuti karta hai...,” he said, adding the BJP membership drive will make ‘Deepotsav’ in Ayodhya a grand spectacle to be watched by the nation and world. “BJP did whatever it said, be it welfare of the poor or unifying the country as a whole,” he said. In a veiled attack on Opposition parties, Yogi said, ‘Bharatiyata’ was not recognised before BJP came to power in 2014. “A new national awareness arose when BJP formed the government under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi,” he said, asserting UP played a crucial role in increasing BJP’s footprints. “It was Amit Shah, who as a UP in charge of the party, went to every district to establish a strong connect with people and this proved to be a game changer and brought BJP to power,” said Yogi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/shah-reinforced-bharatiyata-in-consciousness-of-people-yogi/articleshow/87379412.cms||Pankaj Shah

Amravati, that had signalled the start of the second wave, is at the bottom with less than 100 tests done on several days in the district. Data accessed by TOI shows that the district carried out 82 tests on October 27, 137 on October 26, 95 on October 25 and 49 tests on October 24. Shyamsundar Nikam, civic surgeon of the district, however, said they are doing 250-300 tests daily. “Due to less manpower now, there could be a lag in data entry on the ICMR website. We were given additional staff but they have returned to their parent departments,” he said, adding that the district has had 26 positive cases in 29 days of October. “On most days we found a one-odd positive case, so contacts traced too have declined,” he said. Nandurbar district, on many days, saw less than 100 tests were done. A district official said they haven’t had a positive case in many. A district official said that the capacity of his district is around 5,000-6,000 tests a day, but they are managing to do less than half the number. Health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state has a capacity to conduct 2-2.5 lakh tests and districts have been told to not reduce testing. He said tests have dropped due to low daily detections and fewer contacts to track also, with vaccination there is no need for RT-PCR tests for travelling. "Despite this, we’ve asked districts to keep a close watch especially during the festive season for any spike in cases,” said Tope.  The state Covid taskforce has said that Covid cases could see a surge post-Diwali and testing would be the only method to detect a spike. In West Bengal, for instance, cases have seen a notable rise post-Durga Puja.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/festivity-fall-in-cases-see-avg-daily-tests-dip-in-maharsahtra/articleshow/87378577.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Jaipur||Bizman turned snatcher after thieves stole mother’s chain||Jaipur: The owner of a sprawling tent house business ventured into the world of crime when unidentified thieves looted his mother’s gold chain seven years ago. DCP, crime, Amrita Duhan said that police arrested one Vimal Kumar during a city-wide raid Friday and found his involvement in over 13 chain-snatching crimes in Jaipur. "Police have chargesheeted him (Vimal) in nearly 13 chain-snatching cases till now," Duhan told TOI. Vimal was rounded up on Friday following an intensive search and raid operation conducted simultaneously against chain snatchers. But his interrogation note left police bewildered when Vimal admitted to being both a victim and a perpetrator of the crime. "He claimed that some miscreants had looted his mother’s chain seven years ago. So, he became a snatcher himself," Duhan said. For the past seven years, Vimal has been prowling city streets looking for shining gold chains to steal from women and elderly citizens. The accused is reported to have told crime branch investigators that he believed that chain snatching was an effortless way to earn easy money. For many of his customers, Vimal was still a businessman involved in tent business. According to the police, Vimal’s crime life remained a mystery to many of his close acquaintances. Duhan said that while the accused admitted being involved in 13 cases, the actual number is likely to be higher. "He has been a chain snatcher for the past seven years now. We are examining his criminal antecedents," she said. According to the sources, Vimal got the idea of looting chains immediately after his mother narrated how miscreants had snatched her chain. "His interrogation note certainly sprang up a lot of surprises," an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bizman-turned-snatcher-after-thieves-stole-mothers-chain/articleshow/87378421.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath has provided a distinct identity to Uttar Pradesh, says Amit Shah||LUCKNOW: Asserting that the BJP was once again poised to form the government in UP by bagging more than 300 seats, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday tore into the opposition accusing it of destroying the identity of UP over the years. Shah attributed the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath for bringing about the much needed change in perception about the state since 2017. Flagging off BJP’s membership campaign, `Mera Parivar BJP Parivar’ from Lucknow, Shah lauded CM Yogi Adityanath of giving UP a distinct identity under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. “In a democracy, governments are not for any one family but for the poorest of the poor. But SP, BSP and Congress ruled either for themselves, or for their families or for a particular caste,” he said. He also slammed the opposition for remaining confined to their homes for the past five years only to hit the streets ``wearing new clothes" to deceive people. “UP mein Corona aaya…baadh aayi…aap kahan they, Iska hisaab de dijiye” he said. The home minister categorically unleashed a frontal attack on SP chief Akhilesh Yadav asking him to inform the people about his foreign visits in the last five years. He said that while BJP functionaries worked round the clock, the opposition leaders acted as “chunavi mendhak” who used to come out whenever elections approached. Shah’s stinging diatribe at the opposition in general and Akhilesh in particular was seen as a strong pointer to BJP positioning itself against the SP leadership which has been flexing muscles to thwart the saffron party’s bid of returning to office in 2022. His remark also came amid Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi escalating party’s mass contact campaign --- on Friday she reached Lalitpur to meet the family of a family who allegedly committed suicide after facing shortage of fertilizer. “For the past many years, the game of SP replacing BSP and vice-versa went on. It only ruined the state. The law and order crisis was at its peak. There was an exodus of people from districts like Kairana in west UP. But those in power did not wake up from their slumber,” the home minister charged. He said that those involved in forcing people to migrate “have themselves migrated” from UP under the present BJP dispensation in UP. “Every district had one or two `Bahubali’. All of them have now vanished,” Shah said, extolling the UP government for ensuring security of women and girls and cracking down on the mafia. Shah said that it was because of the people support that the BJP government was able to ensure construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. He also flayed the SP government for ordering firing at “innocent karsewaks” in 1990. “This is the same state where idols of Ram Lalla will be established in a sky-touching temple,” he said. “Akhilesh Babu and company used to ask us as to when the temple would be constructed. PM Modi has already laid the foundation of the temple and Akhilesh could not donate even Rs 5000,” he taunted. Accusing the opposition regime of ignoring UP’s identity as a land of Ram, Krishna and Baba Vishwanath, Shah said that it was only after BJP came to power in 2017 that the state realised its “real identity”. He categorically hailed the Yogi Adityanath government for turning UP into one of the most important states in the country. “It is for the first time that people have realised that a government is not for one family but for the welfare of the poor and downtrodden,” he said, while addressing an impressive gathering of party workers from the Awadh region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/yogi-has-provided-a-distinct-identity-to-up-says-amit-shah/articleshow/87379430.cms||Pankaj Shah

Sale of milk and milk products locally have also been enhanced, he said while attending a government function in Trichy on Friday. “Aavin had owned various outlets in Gulf and European countries. We even had a branch in California, US. We had our branches wherever our Tamil fraternity is living. But for the last 10 years, none of the outlets were operational. Now, we have resumed business in all the outlets. Efforts are also on to sell our Aavin dairy products in our neighbouring states,” Nasar said. Last year, the total sale of Aavin dairy products were 885 tonnes. This year, so far, it has touched 925 tonnes and it would go up to 1,500 before the Diwali festival, the minister said. “In view of Diwali, Aavin has commenced the sale of sweets and dairy products across the state. One day sales have touched Rs 3 crore in Chennai on Thursday. It is an achievement in the history of Aavin in Tamil Nadu. We hope that we would attain the targeted sale of 1,500 tonnes before Diwali,” Nasar said. On the total production of milk from across the state, Nasar said 36 lakh litres per day was produced during the tenure of the AIADMK, but, now it has shot up to 41 lakh litres after the DMK assumed power, he added. When asked about the action taken against former milk and dairy minister Rajenthra Balaji with regard to the alleged irregularities that occurred in the department during his tenure, Nasar said, “Summons have been issued to him. Further action will be taken against him.” The minister also disbursed arrears amounting to the tune of Rs 65 crore to the farmers during the event. Minister for municipal administration, urban and water supply K N Nehru, minister for backward classes welfare S S Sivasankar and Nasar handed over the dues to the milk producers. District collector S Sivarasu and officials from the milk and dairy department participated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/export-of-aavin-products-resumes-after-10-years/articleshow/87378414.cms||---

The magistrate court had on October 23 issued the showcause notice for failing to comply with its directions. Police moved a sessions court against the order, which put an interim stay till the next date of hearing. The sessions court, however, said the primary duty of the IO in criminal matters was to assist the court in expeditious disposal of cases and it was the duty of the IO to supply a complete set of documents to the accused within the statutory period. Principal district and sessions judge Ramesh Kumar said a perusal of the magistrate court’s order revealed that despite a specific direction on September 22, the IO had failed to supply the coloured photographs to the accused. The trial court has also observed that the directions in respect of supplying a complete set of documents along with the CCTV footage in riot cases pending before it have not been complied with, the sessions court noted in its order on Wednesday. It further said that to avoid undue delay in the trial at the magistrate’s court, the IO was directed to supply the deficient coloured photographs and CCTV footage, if any, to the accused as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a week from the date of this order. “The IO concerned is hereby directed to make necessary endeavour to supply the deficient coloured photographs to the accused in the matter pending before the trial court within the above mentioned period,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-stays-showcause-notice-asks-police-to-supply-all-papers-to-accused-in-ne-riots-case/articleshow/87378423.cms||Usha Das

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Stringent measures fail to check cheating in exams||JAIPUR: A data of last four years indicate that stringent measures yielded little success in curing cheating during exams. Cases filed under the Rajasthan Public Examination (Prevention of Unfairmeans) Act, 1992, show that the cheating menace in the state is far from over. A total of 104 cases were registered this year till October in the act, compared to 46 last year, 71 in 2019 and 111 in 2018. The act was enacted to prevent the leakage of question papers and the use of unfair means at public examinations. As per the data, the highest cases were filed in the Barmer (9) district this year under the act. Due to pandemic enforced lockdowns, only a few examinations were conducted last year and yet the state logged 46 cases. A senior official told TOI that increasing cases of cheating can also be attributed to the greater emphasis on transparency. “Cheatings are not a new phenomenon in the state. The only difference is that the modern tools of surveillance have exposed what was once a discreet business. Government jobs are most coveted and dubious elements crop up to benefit from gullible students,” the official added. The state had to scrap 2018 constable recruitment tests after police discovered that a gang was involved in rigging the online test. Similar senses unfolded last month when police found that question paper for a teachers recruitment test had reached some accused before the exam. The recently conducted Patwari exams also saw over 25 accused nabbed across the state for attempting to cheat in the exam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/stringent-measures-fail-to-check-cheating-in-exams/articleshow/87378433.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Eastern Railway set to run full fleet to decongest trains||KOLKATA: Eastern Railway (ER) is ready to operate its entire fleet of local trains as services resume from Sunday. Officials of ER, which runs the majority of suburban services in the state, ruled out a phased restart this time, unlike last year. Services were suspended on May 6, when the second wave struck. Suburban train services, suspended for the public since May 6, will resume on Sunday with the state on Friday allowing 50% of passenger strength. “Seats can’t be regulated on local trains because they are not reserved. We expect the state government to help us maintain the 50% capacity,” a senior Railways official told TOI. ER spokesperson Ekalabya Chakraborty said: “We are prepared to operate our entire fleet of EMUs. It may take a day or two to go full strength, but most trains will be back on the tracks by the end of next week.” In pre-Covid times, ER operated 922 EMUs (electric multiple unit) trains in Sealdah and 488 along the Howrah division. South-Eastern Railway, however, will have a phased resumption. But then, the zone only runs 190 EMUs on its suburban section. An SER official said, “We will take a few days to understand passenger behaviour. But the phased restart will be immediate and not over weeks. We shall keep adding the trains and may have all 190 services back in a fortnight.” Chakraborty added: “There will be continuous announcements in the public address system, so that people do not board unnecessarily. We also expect the state government to help us. Law and order is a state subject.” Doctors welcomed the state decision. “The way these special trains were running, it was riskier. People troop into these trains, as they are the only link to and from the city. Resumption of local trains will streamline things,” said Peerless Hospital clinical director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/er-set-to-run-full-fleet-to-decongest-trains/articleshow/87377050.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Restos welcome nod to capacity rise, time relief||KOLKATA: The hospitality industry cheerfully greeted the announcement on Friday that the ceiling on seating capacity in bars, restaurants and gatherings inside hotels have been increased to 70% from 50%. It will lead to a 25% rise in footfall across restaurants and a substantial restoration of business for hotels that have been struggling to survive, said Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) officials. It also pointed out that the extension of closing time for restaurants from 10.30pm to 11pm will draw in a larger crowd. “We had been waiting for these announcements. The easing of restrictions on seating capacity and the extension of closing time will benefit restaurants. In Kolkata, the dining hours are late and extend till 11pm. So, unless you can serve till at least 10.30pm, footfalls will never be optimum,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who also owns Song-Hai restaurant. There was some concern and lack of clarity about the extended closing time, though. While the government order allows restaurants to operate ‘not beyond 11pm’, it coincides with the beginning of night restriction hours. “We are waiting for clarity on this,” said Poddar. Mocambo and Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari said the move will boost the restaurant business in Kolkata that has been struggling since the pandemic and is a definite step towards normalcy. “Crowds had swelled across the restaurants during the Pujas when the night restriction was lifted and closing time extended. This will encourage a lot more people to visit restaurants,” said Kothari. Weekend crowds will now swell across restaurants, felt Shiladitya Chaudhury, owner of Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2. “Families prefer to stay out late for dinner on weekends. We had to wind up orders by 10pm, which is a tad early in Kolkata. It will now be 10.30 and the extra half-an-hour will make a lot of difference,” said Chaudhury. “Deferred timing will help restaurants at a time when footfall is rising,” said Amber owner Sanjay Khullar. “We had a big turnout on Puja days when late closure was allowed. This indicates that footfall will rise with the additional 30 minutes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/restos-welcome-nod-to-capacity-rise-time-relief/articleshow/87377043.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Delhi||A premeditated conspiracy: Cops to Delhi court in Sharjeel case||NEW DELHI: Police claimed before a Delhi court on Friday that there was a premeditated conspiracy, for which the northeast Delhi riots took place in February last year. The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during hearing of a bail plea of former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan, booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in the case. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for police, said it was rarely possible to establish conspiracy through direct evidence, but it can be established through circumstantial evidence and conduct of the accused. “Assuming there is a conspiracy and no offence takes place, and riots had not taken place, that conspiracy in itself was punishable, Here the case of the prosecution is that conspiracy was there and riots took place. Whoever does whatever singular act will be responsible for another’s act,” he argued. He further alleged that a WhatsApp group was formed by co-accused Sharjeel Imam called “Muslim Students of Jamia”, whose chats revealed that he was in touch with a “communal and radical group”. Referring to the Facebook page of “Students of Jamia”, he alleged that it was clear that the posts were neither secular nor democratic or nationalistic. “They are against secularism, democracy and nationalism. It is clearly a situation where these posts are against secularism, democracy and nationalism,” the public prosecutor had claimed. Jahan’s counsel had earlier argued that she had been falsely implicated in the case and there was no iota of evidence to show her involvement in the riots.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/a-premeditated-conspiracy-cops-to-court-in-sharjeel-case/articleshow/87378455.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Victory in Uttar Pradesh will prolong BJP’s victory run: Amit Shah||LUCKNOW: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday said that BJP’s victory in the 2022 UP assembly elections would prolong the party’s victory run. Affirming that the Yogi government in UP managed to fulfil “more than 90%” of the promises it made to the people in 2017 assembly elections, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday exhorted party workers to expeditiously carry out the membership drive and get the feedback from maximum number of household which will help the party brass in devising its election manifesto for 2022 assembly elections.  “We had promised to fast-track development of UP and we did it,” Shah said, stressing that the BJP government turned UP into the country's second largest economic state from 7th position it acquired before 2017. Shah cited various parameters including employment, medical facilities and infrastructure where the state improved its position under the incumbent Yogi Adityanath government in the last five years. He also hailed the UP government for taking adequate measures in controlling the Corona pandemic. “This can only happen when you think beyond your family and a few selected castes,” Shah said. He said that the BJP required another five year term to completely remove the maladies which infested the state during the previous SP and BSP regime. BJP’s membership drive is said to have played a pivotal role in its overwhelming electoral success in UP during 2014, 2019 Lok Sabha and in 2017 UP elections. Shah, said that the fresh membership drive was like sounding a poll bugle for the forthcoming state elections. He said that for the opposition parties elections were a “means to usurp power”, but BJP saw it as an opportunity to spread its ideology to every household, understanding people’s problems and bringing welfare programmes of the government to their door steps. “Ye Loktantra ka Mahotsav hai..Lok sampark ka zariya hai,” he said. Shah remarked that though a BJP worker believed in “family planning”, the party tended to “broke the rule” to expand its base. “Hence the membership drive, which will help in expanding the party footprint,” he reasoned. Having a strength of around 2.30 crore workers, including those who showed their right wing leaning through missed calls, the party aims to make 1.5 crore new members. The drive will be carried out till December 31, 2021. Shah pitched the revocation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir as one of the key fulfilment of promise it has been making in its previous election manifestos. He maintained that doing away with Article 370 has made J&K an “inseparable part” of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/victory-in-up-will-prolong-bjps-victory-run-amit-shah/articleshow/87379447.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Kolkata||181 in 2019 to 278 in 2020: Kolkata saw 54% jump in suicides in Covid year||KOLKATA: The city witnessed a 54% rise in suicides during Covid-hit 2020, with the total number increasing from 181 in 2019 to 278 last year. This accounted for one of highest jumps in suicides witnessed in a year, and the trend reflected in some of the 53 cities that were considered for a survey. The data, which was revealed in the latest NCRB Suicide and Traffic report for 2020 released on Thursday, showed a 200% rise in suicides in Srinagar, 65% in Ranchi and 50% in Lucknow. But the city’s overall rate of suicide was merely 2, a figure calculated as number of suicides per 1 lakh population, stated the NCRB report, considered an authentic indicator. This is barely a fraction of the national city average of 14.8 and a fraction of the overall national average of 11.3. Kolkata’s rate of suicide is the second lowest in the country, behind Srinagar (0.5). The city’s total suicide number is also much lower than that in almost all other metros. Even in Bengal, it is Asansol—329 people there died by suicide in 2020—that reported maximum number of suicides in the first year of the pandemic and not Kolkata. Compared to 278 cases in Kolkata, Delhi reported 3,025 suicides, registering a jump of almost 25% from 2019. Chennai reported 2,430 suicides in 2020 and Bangalore 2,196. Almost all cities in India witnessed a rise in suicides in the pandemic, the notable exceptions being Dhanbad and Agra. The study showed not one suicide in Kolkata was due to bankruptcy or unemployment. Instead, 197 cases were attributed to mental illness and three to physical illness. Given the content of suicide notes, marriage problems, dowry demands and extra-marital affairs were reasons for 43 cases. Drug abuse and failure in exams were also cited among the multiple reasons that led to the drastic steps. June last year was one of the worst months. On June 9, four persons, including a 10-year-old, in the city died by suicide. Three of them consumed poison, while the child hanged herself. Days later, on June 14, five suicides were reported by the Kolkata Police. The victims included a 38-year-old, two senior citizens, and two middle-aged people. All five had hanged themselves. It was the same day Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput had hanged himself. The same week, on June 17, seven suicides were reported across Kolkata. The victims included another 10-year-old, two 19-year-olds and a 30-year-old. In the first week of July, three people died by suicide, including a police constable who shot himself. While biological, psychological and sociological reasons were responsible for mental vulnerabilities, people in India were wrongly conditioned to believe they should never admit their fragility, felt counsellors. “It drives many to suicide without any apparent warning,” said psychological counsellor Soumya Mukherjee. There is never a single reason behind a suicide, says psychiatrist J Ram. “Depression is a complex interplay of multiple factors. So, there are always a number of reasons that generally combine to drive an individual towards suicide. Many, particularly those prone to depression, have been feeling isolated during the pandemic,” said Ram. He added many suffering from depression often refused help, believing it was not masculine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/181-in-19-to-278-in-20-kol-saw-54-jump-in-suicides-in-cov-yr/articleshow/87378486.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||KMC seeks law to acquire rickety buildings in Kolkata||KOLKATA: In an effort to secure the lives of those staying in dilapidated buildings, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) intends to acquire some of the high-risk structures for reconstruction. The tenants will be given ownership rights when the new buildings come up. However, KMC will give priority to those insecure buildings where there are no recorded owners. The proposal, prepared by the KMC buildings department, was accepted by the board of administrators on Friday. It will be sent to Nabanna for clearance. Once approved, it will be placed before the assembly to empower the civic body acquire dilapidated buildings for reconstruction. The recent spate of building collapses across the city has prompted the KMC to take up such an initiative. As the first step, KMC executive engineers at the borough level have been asked to identify such vulnerable buildings. “We have started compiling the list,” said a KMC buildings department official. The need for reconstruction of highly dilapidated buildings was badly felt after a section of the tenants and residents of dilapidated buildings in Burrabazar area recently sought permission for repairing of the buildings as owners couldn’t be traced. “We tenants held an urgent meeting and agreed to repair the most vulnerable parts of our buildings to save our lives. But since we don’t enjoy the ownership status, an appeal before the KMC buildings department is still pending,” said Anil Sharaf, a resident of a dilapidated building on Rabindra Sarani. Sharaf welcomed the civic initiative of restructuring dilapidated buildings. “If that finally happens, we shouldn’t hesitate to contribute whatever we can depending on the financial status,” he said. The civic body is particularly looking at redeveloping dilapidated buildings in areas such as Cossipore, Chitpore, Burrabazar, Cotton Street, Pathuriaghata Street, Shyampukur, Jorasanko, MG Road, Taltala, Amherst Street, Elliot Road, Bhowanipore, Kidderpore and Lake Road, among other areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-seeks-law-to-acquire-rickety-buildings-in-kol/articleshow/87377079.cms||Saikat Ray

The milestone was announced by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on social media calling the jabs ‘victory vaccine.’ Earlier, on October 19, UP had become the first state in the country to have given jabs to 12 crore of its population, which was also a record. Of the 13 crore vaccinated in UP till now, 9.78 crores have received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, while 3.21 crore people have received both doses of the vaccine against novel coronavirus infection.

The teachers demanded a meeting with the education secretary and were informed by the SDM that the meeting had been fixed for November 3. Union president Gurlabh Singh alias Bhola said three of their members were staging a fast unto death on top of a water tank near Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara. “When Pargat Singh was MLA, he promised us that he would get our appointments regularised at the earliest after becoming minister but he forgot all about it later.

The high court registry issued two separate office orders and said the existing system of restricted physical hearings would continue for the high court and district courts till November 18 and November 20, respectively. The court shall, however, permit hybrid/videoconferencing hearing where a request to such effect is made by any of the parties and/order their counsel, said the office order for the district courts. In March 2020, the high court had started holding proceedings through videoconferencing following the outbreak of Covid-19, and subsequently, a few benches were allowed to hold physical courts every day on a rotation basis. Complete physical hearings were resumed in high court from March 15, 2021, but on April 8, it was ordered that matters would be taken up through virtual mode only on account of the second wave. In August, the high court again announced that it would start physical hearings in a restricted manner from August 31, following which two division benches and 10 single-judge benches conducted proceedings physically and the remaining benches continued to take up matters through videoconferencing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-district-courts-to-resume-full-physical-hearings-from-november-22/articleshow/87378492.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Police rush in to control stargazing crowds milling around jail, Mannat||MUMBAI: It was a Friday release that Shah Rukh Khan’s family, friends and fans were waiting eagerly for, their eyes on the clock expecting the actor’s son Aryan Khan to walk out of prison. But even as the drone of crowds outside Arthur Road Jail grew louder and Mannat, the Khan home in Bandra, sparkled with fairy lights, it was a countdown that did not end after Aryan’s bail papers missed the jail’s deadline. While the sea of humanity that erupted near Mannat on Thursday as soon as news broke of Aryan being granted bail had been kept at bay by the police who cordoned off the road outside the actor’s bungalow with only media allowed to take up space, a large crowd had gathered outside Arthur Road Jail in anticipation of SRK’s arrival and Aryan’s exit.  Traffic cops rushed in to control the bottleneck caused by cars and taxis slowing down while police personnel from N M Joshi Marg had to be called in to manage the milling crowd of onlookers queued up on pavements, perched on the divider and trailing every arriving car, to greet the actor. “I have come here to see King Khan,” said a youngster, waiting outside Arthur Road’s gate for over three hours. A man in his 30s said, “I come to this area for work but when I heard Shah Rukh Khan’s son might come out of jail soon, I decided to wait.” A group of women grew impatient with speculation that Aryan’s release may be delayed to Saturday.  Aryan’s bail papers failed to meet the 5.30pm deadline when the bail box closes for further submissions. “The bail box outside the jail is opened four times a day following which the bail documents submitted are verified before allowing a prisoner to step out of jail. If someone drops the bail paper after the specified time, the prisoner is released the next day,” a jail source told TOI. Earlier in the day, the mood at the Khan household had seemed upbeat. SRK had left home in the afternoon, perhaps hopeful the formalities would be completed for Aryan to walk free while Diwali arrived early at Mannat. Their domestic help were seen draping the house with strings of light that came on after dusk and dispelled the darkness of one more night before the Khans can welcome their son back home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-police-rush-in-to-control-stargazing-crowds-milling-around-jail-mannat/articleshow/87379470.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The division bench of Rajasthan High Court on Friday heard petitions challenging the ban on mobile internet services during competitive exams. The court also granted time to the Advocate General for the reply to be filed by the government. Bench was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Neeraj Yadav, wherein the petitioner has termed the internet ban as ‘unconstitutional’. The Advocate General informed the court that similar petitions were pending with the principal seat in Jodhpur of the Rajasthan High Court, where the next hearing is on November 23. Thus, the bench asked to send the PILs to the chief justice so that the Chief Justice bench can hear all petitions together. Petitioner Yadav has made chief secretary and home secretary government of Rajasthan as respondents in the case and stated that internet ban during competitive exams caused inconvenience.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/send-all-petitions-on-net-ban-to-chief-justice-hc/articleshow/87378481.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Malls may tweak business timings only if night curbs are relaxed||KOLKATA: A half-hour increase in business hours can make a substantial difference to revenues at restaurants, food courts and multiplexes in malls. But the operators will enhance the business time only if there is relaxation in night restrictions for customers and employees to return thereafter. “If the closure timing is extended till 11pm, show timings in multiplexes will be rejigged so that they can cater to more movie buffs. In restaurants, it will definitely mean a more relaxed dinner. There will be no difference to retail. More than the relaxation in footfall, it is the easing of closure time that will make a difference,” said Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra. The management of South City mall and the twin City Centres, too, are excited about the additional half hour of business. But they want clarity about night restrictions before going ahead with the late closure. “After the gradual rise in Covid cases, police have recently become more strict with night restrictions. If they are flexible and allow customers and staff to return home without worry, it will be very useful. Or else, we may evaluate the option of opening the cinemas and outlets that serve breakfast items early to squeeze in more shows and take advantage of the movie releases slated around Diwali,” said Ambuja Neotia wholetime director Ramesh Pandey of City Centre I and II. South City mall that has recorded footfall in excess of 1 lakh on two days during Durga Puja expects footfall to creep up once schools and colleges open next month. “We are also looking forward to Christmas and New Year when the mall sees a good turnout. But we are being cautious about crowding, and hence, not screening the T20 World Cup matches,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. Sushil Mohta, the developer and operator of Acropolis and co-developer of South City, hoped the Covid situation would improve and allow businesses to recover. “The state has managed the situations during peak numbers effectively. Now that it is allowing relaxation, it is more imperative that we follow all protocols,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/malls-may-tweak-biz-timings-only-if-night-curbs-are-relaxed/articleshow/87377084.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Delhi||Court rejects plea against DU principal, profs over alleged casteist remarks||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed an application filed by a sacked professor seeking registration of an FIR against the principal and other professors of a Delhi University college for alleged casteist remarks, saying the police had rightly not lodged the case on her complaint. Additional sessions judge Charu Aggarwal declined to take cognisance of the complaint as no offence was made out from its contents. The court noted that the action taken report (ATR), filed by the police, disclosed that the complainant had exhausted all the remedies available to her in law before Delhi High Court for all her grievances mentioned in the present complaint and when she did not get any relief from there, she filed the present application before this court. “At this stage, it would be pertinent to mention that the complainant in her entire application in hand has not disclosed about the proceedings which took place before Hon’ble Delhi High Court,” the court said in its order on October 26. It further said that a close reading of the instant application would reveal that the main grievance of the complainant against the respondents was her termination from the post of ad hoc additional professor by the principal. “...In order to settle her ‘personal vindicta’, she has filed the present case making all those allegations already made by her before the high court.” “So far as the allegations under the SC/ST Act are concerned, on that also, the complainant has not given any specific instance when she was insulted or humiliated due to her caste by either of the respondents/accused… The entire material on record clearly show that the allegations mentioned in the application in hand are nothing but afterthought, after exhausting all the remedies upto Hon’ble Delhi High Court,” the court observed. It further said, “Prima facie, no offence under IPC and under SC/ST Act are made out. Accordingly, the concerned police has rightly not registered the FIR on the complaint of the complainant. This court also declines to take cognisance.” The police had earlier told the court that no offence was made out under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against the principal from the complaint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-rejects-plea-against-du-principal-profs-over-alleged-casteist-remarks/articleshow/87378517.cms||Usha Das

---||Kolkata||Declare private bus industry sick, operators urge West Bengal govt||KOLKATA: Given the astronomical diesel prices—it was Rs 100.49 a litre in Kolkata on Friday—the time may have come for the government to declare the private bus industry “sick”, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates and Minibus Operators Coordination Committee have said. Immediately after the diesel rate crossed the Rs 100 mark on Thursday, private buses on several routes went off the road, saying it would not be feasible to run the vehicles in the current situation. With the state transport department asking private bus owners to furnish details of the exact number of buses still operational, Tapan Banerjee, on behalf of Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, claimed the “government should look at how its own routes were folding up”. “Fewer than 400 state buses have been hitting the road a day. Several government bus routes, like 2, 2B, 10, S11, 12D and 3A, have been running on skeletal services, despite their receiving government aide. We do not have anyone to fund us. We demand diesel be brought under GST to enable us to continue services. We also demand that the industry is declared sick,” said Banerjee, pointing out they were looking at financial packages for survival. According to private bus operators, the diesel price might have had hit a century in Kolkata on Thursday, but the rate has been extensively high for a while . As a result, they have been withdrawing buses for a week now. For example, of the 22 buses on the KB-15 route, only 13 have been operating. On Route 230, between Kamarhati and the Alipore zoo, 25 out of the 60 buses did not run on Thursday, while on Route 235, between Amtala and Salt Lake, around 16 buses did not run. The popular routes of 007, 75, 83 and 17B have been running fewer than five buses each. Swapan Ghosh from Minibus Operators Coordination Committee said the situation was similar in their section. The Joka-Ruby minibus route, which has 14 buses, has been operating merely four. The Dunlop-BBD Bag minibus route has been running only four of its 20 buses since Monday. All of the 20 Behala-Chowrasta minibuses have stopped plying. But Ghosh and a few others hope for a revival once suburban trains start operating from next Sunday. “We hope once local trains begin plying, we can meet some of our costs. If that does not happen, we may have to stop services even of this depleted fleet,” said Ghosh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/declare-pvt-bus-industry-sick-operators-urge-govt/articleshow/87378512.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Halls, film-makers laud ‘positive step’||KOLKATA: Without stressing on alternate seating, the state has allowed cinemas, along with theatre halls, manchas and auditoria to operate with 70% capacity. This effectively means viewers in Bengal can sit together and enjoy movies if they follow all health protocols. Currently, Odisha, Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have allowed cinemas to operate with 100% capacity. However, cinemas in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Goa, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Kerala are still running with 50% occupancy. “I am grateful to our government for this pro-industry move,” said Ratan Saha, chairman of the exhibitors’ section of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA). Shantanu Roychowdhury, the EIMPA treasurer and owner of Belgharia’s Rupmandir, said, “The livelihood of 20 lakh people — directly or indirectly — depends on cinemas in Bengal. The response to ‘Golondaaj’ came as a ray of light in the dark tunnel the pandemic has thrown us into. With this new order, we are expecting a better turnout for big Diwali releases like ‘Sooryavanshi’.” Exhibitor-distributor Satadeep Saha said, “With 50% occupancy, Bengal had seen houseful shows for some movies during the Pujas. Cinemas are here to stay so all we need is good content.” Regional director at INOX (East) Amitava Guha Thakurta, said, “It is a step towards normalcy. A group can now sit together. Once a ticket or tickets are sold, we will be leaving seats on both sides vacant,” he said. Viewers are wondering if this order is an incentive for cinemas like Paradise, which closed down in March 2021, to consider reopening. Sunit Singh of Bengal Properties, which has another 30 years of lease of Paradise Cinema, told TOI, “We will take a decision in January 2022.” Film-makers, too, are happy. Director Atanu Ghosh, whose ‘Binisutoy’ had run for 50 days at Nandan 1 after its release on August 20, said, “Each small step towards 100% occupancy is worth a celebration. Given the enthusiastic response we got for ‘Binisutoy’ only a month ago, there’s no apprehension regarding the eagerness of the audience to watch films on the big screen.” Talks have started on whether or not producers will want to release the big Bengali movies that have been on hold or are being shot now. Producer Firdausul Hasan, who has Atanu Ghosh’s ‘Sesh Pata’ and Arindam Sil’s ‘Mahananda’ in post-production, said, “If the Covid situation is under control, I am hoping our government will allow 100% occupancy by Christmas. We are aiming for a release of both films in January.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/halls-film-makers-laud-positive-step/articleshow/87377092.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Led by the president of new market traders association, Vinod Shirodkar, the traders marched to the Margao municipality to voice their grievances before the civic authorities. The traders pointed out to Pereira that the roadside vendors who sell items ranging from flowers and incense sticks to garments and footwear were eating into their businesses ahead of the Diwali festival. They called into question the inaction of MMC market inspectors in reining in the illegal encroachments by roadside vendors. The traders also pointed out to Pereira the need for undertaking repairs and maintenance work of the market shed. Stating that the lights in the market weren’t functioning, the traders said that it posed a threat to the security of their customers, particularly women, during late evening hours. With hardly a few days for Diwali, there’s a rush of customers in the new municipal market. Pereira assured the traders that MMC will brook no illegalities in the municipal markets and that the demands of the traders will be looked into. Later speaking to reporters, Pereira said that he, along with the market committee of MMC, will conduct an inspection of the market on Saturday to take stock of the situation. “Action will definitely be taken against all illegalities,” Pereira said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/act-against-illegal-vendors-margao-traders/articleshow/87378534.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Tapal duty cops needn’t wear uniform||AURANGABAD: Personnel deployed for tapal duty at all police units across the state have been exempted from wearing uniforms while travelling to deliver tapals (written communication). The decision was taken after additional director general of police (administration) Anup Kumar Singh noticed that important tapals were not being accepted at some places stating that the policemen carrying the tapals were not in proper police uniform. Singh said, “Those on tapal duty have to carry a large bunch of papers and important communications. At times, when the police travel to state police headquarters and other districts for delivering the tapal, they are compelled to carry an additional bag consisting of their uniform.” The senior IPS officer said that the exemption is aimed at giving some relief to the tapal duty constables, who are frequently on a move for delivering and bringing back important communications. “This decision means one less bag for the constables to carry while on tapal duty,” Singh said. Singh further pointed out that in most of the cases, tapal duty constables receive emergency tapals to deliver on the eleventh hour, due to which they cannot even get confirmed tickets. As their primary job is to safely carry the communications and deliver them to the concerned office, carrying an additional bag for uniform is a burden.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/tapal-duty-cops-neednt-wear-uniform/articleshow/87374309.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: You may need to pay more for liquor now||NEW DELHI: The good news is that liquor will be available at the new stores soon. The bad news? Prices are likely to go up by up to 9%. Delhi government’s excise department is in the process of fixing the maximum retail prices of brands and these will be calculated according to the formula under the new excise policy. A liquor trader, associated with an alcohol sellers’ association, said the increase in the wholesale price will lead to 5-10% increase in the retail prices. An excise department official, however, asserted that the retail price may not increase due to market competition and the discounts that stores can give to attract customers. The private alcohol shops will start functioning under the 2021-22 excise policy from November 17 when all the existing government liquor shops will shut down permanently. In the new policy, Delhi government has subsumed the excise duty and VAT in the licence fee and imposed only a nominal excise duty and VAT of 1% on the landing price, according to an order issued by the excise department on Thursday. An excise official said that the impact on wholesale price due to the incorporation of central sales tax at 2%, profit margin for the wholesaler, import pass fee and freight and handling charges, as approved in the excise policy, will lead to a 8-9% price change. A total of 849 vends will be allowed to be operated across the city by private entities. “It is a reasonable assumption that since all vends shall be operated by private business entities in a competitive market environment, they would operate at their maximum efficiency and the market size in terms of number of cases sold is likely to show a significant increase as compared to 2019-20,” the excise order said. The capping of Rs 50 as retail margin on sale of Indian made foreign liquor and Rs 100 on the sale of foreign liquor has been discontinued and there will be no cap on the retail margin of both type as also beer and wine. Competition in the market, it is hoped, will benefit the consumer. Under the new policy, rebate on MRP has been allowed to bring competitive market forces into effect. “It is important that the consumer should not be burdened with price increase,” the excise order noted. “The changes brought about in the new excise policy will need reasonable time to play out in the market. In the overall interests of consumers of Delhi, to prevent interstate smuggling, the MRP for 2021-22 should as far as possible be in the same range as prevailing in Delhi.” The excise department will fix the MRP for each product after taking into account the input of licensees and the price of the product in neighbouring Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. The MRP prevailing in Delhi has been compared with the neighbouring states and seen to be generally lower.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/you-may-need-to-pay-more-for-liquor-now/articleshow/87409041.cms||AlokKNMishra

The architect’s ride began in Hyderabad on October 11 and she had taken the lengthy journey to raise awareness about women’s mobility. Bharati, founder of Moving Women Social Initiatives Foundation (MOWO), has already covered over 10 cities. MOWO is collaborating with Shell Foundation on the “Moving Boundaries” campaign to encourage women to pick up driving skills and become self-sufficient in transport and daily work commute. “Every time we go on long motorcycle trips, we end up inspiring many people about their closeness to mobility,” Bharathi told TOI. “One skill that many women in our country, especially those from the lower income groups, lack is driving. For many of them, learning to drive a two-wheeler is not only a distant dream but also a social barrier.” The objective behind her ride is, therefore, to highlight how women can be taught to drive and to increase their self-confidence, Bharati revealed, “We train women in self-help groups and those who are already small-scale entrepreneurs. This helps them to increase their productivity. For example, if someone is involved in packaging or tailoring, we train her so she no longer has to depend on someone else to go out and buy or deliver products.” The number of women drivers who are involved in the growing e-commerce deliveries sector is also negligible and through this initiative women can get trained to earn an income, Bharathi said. She aims to cover 11,111 km in 40 days to promote the idea that women’s mobility is the need of the hour. “We need to have a consortium of organisations who are working to create a greater impact on the subject,” said Bharati. “Right now, women in mobility is not seen as a need and it is for this reason that we need to work together.” She disclosed that MOWO, which was founded in 2019, has trained over 1,500 women to ride and drive. Bharathi, who also held a workshop in Delhi on Friday, said, “We are travelling around the country to take learnings on how women can adapt to mobility in a particular city. Each city has a different story and we are working to identify organisations that can take forward our initiative. We want to encourage women to own a vehicle, preferably an e-vehicle, and drive it or ride it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/architect-makes-pit-stop-in-city-as-she-drives-home-her-point/articleshow/87378549.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Jaipur||Finance department stops RTE entitlements for 50,000 Rajasthan private schools||JAIPUR: The finance department has stopped Right to Education (RTE) entitlements for 50,000 state private schools citing that the schools were shut due to the pandemic and the bills could not be cleared without verifying if regular online classes were conducted. The state government has to pay more than Rs 300 crore to the private schools under RTE. According to sources in the department, the proposal of releasing the amount was cleared by the finance department earlier and funds for some schools were also released, however, the department decided to take back the amount released. As the schools remained closed in the session 2020-21, and students were made to study online. The finance department has asked the government to make a complete plan and verify the quality of education on the basis of which funds will be released and the mode of payment will be decided. Meanwhile, Jaipur district education officer Jagdish Meena said they have cleared the file and sent it to the higher authorities and soon the bills will be cleared. The Rajasthan government has claimed that it will conduct a physical verification of at least 25% schools to check whether online classes held releasing the budget. Schools were asked to fill up forms. However, most schools were found to be giving false information of students said officials at Directorate of Bikaner, adding that it proved that online classes weren’t held. Later on, the government decided to take it on affidavit that online classes were conducted by the private schools and decided to release the budget for all. This move has now been questioned by the finance department. President of School Shiksha Pariwar, Anil Sharma, said, "We have been demanding that the budget should be released to help schools. RTE money has been stuck for a long time. We want proper discussion. Our money that is pending for the last three years should be released."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/finance-dept-stops-rte-entitlements-for-50000-state-private-schools/articleshow/87378530.cms||---

---||Delhi||Pandemic effect? Deaths by suicide in Delhi went up 24% in 2020||NEW DELHI: Suicides in Delhi went up by 24.2% in 2020 compared with 2019, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. Police officers and mental health experts say one of the reasons could be pandemic-induced depression. Death by suicides also saw a rise of around 10% across the country. Therapists and psychologists TOI spoke to stated that loneliness and the scare of the disease both contributed to the rise in suicide cases. Delhi reported 2,526 suicides in 2019 compared with 3,142 in 2020. Nimesh Desai, director of Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, told TOI, “While organisations and experts globally had predicted that depression would be a health problem across the world by 2020, I never thought it would impact people so much. It’s very important that people don’t shy away and come out in the open if they are going through something.” “The figures for 2021 may be somewhat similar as the second Covid-19 wave left a deep impact on people as many lost a close one or a family member. It’s important to keep a positive attitude, believe in yourself and try to speak to a close person. The most important aspect is to reach out for an early start. Currently, that’s an issue we are dealing with as most people keep sulking,” added Desai. Speaking about the factors that led to the higher percentage of suicides, Desai said, “The economic slowdown and unemployment impacted the mental health of people severely. Apart from this, there was also the fear of getting infected, depression from hospital experience, societal concerns, among other things. Self-love and self-care play an important role as one must take care of oneself first. This doesn’t happen in one day and is a gradual process.” Tanya Anthwal, a psychologist, opined that during the pandemic, people experienced moodiness, preferred being cooped up, hardly got out of bed, felt anxious and made a stark change in their eating habits. Speaking of risks, Anthwal said, “There was an enormous increase in screen time or playing video games, social isolation, exhausting online classes, and decline in face-to-face communication and interaction.” “Among the people I counselled, there was a case in which the family lost their sole breadwinner due to Covid-19. This forced youngsters to take on new responsibilities and financial burden. This made them go through emotional turbulence and depression. Such stress is most likely to trigger suicidal thoughts and behaviour,” added Anthwal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pandemic-effect-deaths-by-suicide-went-up-24-in-2020/articleshow/87378545.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Goa||Patel inspires Goa’s para TT players with words and action||Old Goa: Moses Rodrigues’ interest in table tennis was spurred two years ago when the Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) held a para sports awareness camp two years ago. The 36-year-old has a locomotive disability, and despite taking part in the national championships early this year, his interest was on the wane. It’s no secret that para players have no access to stadiums, no funds, and no coaches to guide them. Rodrigues almost gave up, until he heard the story of Bhavina Patel, India’s first ever table tennis Paralympics medallist. Now, after a meeting with the table tennis star, he is raring to go again. "I saw Bhavina play at the nationals and was inspired by her game,” said Rodrigues. “I used to think that the problem of inaccessible stadiums was restricted to Goa. But after speaking with Bhavina, I got to know that it’s not easy even in Gujarat. She had to brave everything to win a silver medal at the Tokyo Paralympics.” Patel was in Goa to attend the 18th anniversary celebrations of DRAG on Saturday. It was not just Rodrigues that she inspired with her words and action. Lloyd Fernandes is another one. “There are no para coaches here, so I tried to learn everything through online videos. When I surfed about para TT players in India, the first name that came up was Bhavina. I used to watch every available video of hers to learn how she plays, the techniques she uses, and tried to do the same,” said Fernandes, 34, who was confined to a wheelchair after a motorbike accident in 2016. A champion with his higher secondary school team, Fernandes is now attempting to win the first national medal for Goa. On Saturday, he moved a step closer – with strong belief – after an encounter with Patel. “I got a chance to play with Bhavina,” said Fernandes. “It was like a dream come true. I got to learn so much -- techniques, rules, disability classification, how to serve etc. These small details make a huge difference and will help me at the nationals”. Patel spoke for more than an hour with Goa’s para table tennis players, all of who were thrilled to learn from the best player in the world. She spent quite some time playing with the Goans too. “When I started playing table tennis, I did not have a coach. I learned by watching videos. You have to work hard. If you are dreaming big, then besides training, you need to focus on your physiotherapy, diet and mental strength,” Patel told the players. Afflicted with polio as a toddler and using crutches ever since, Patel fell in love with table tennis when she moved to Ahmedabad. The game –and the medal in Tokyo –changed her life. “I trained inside my small-sized bedroom where there was no space for movement. Don’t spend too much time thinking about equipment and facilities. Get your basics strong and focus on the game,” said Patel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/patel-inspires-goas-para-tt-players-with-words-and-action/articleshow/87409057.cms||---

Of these three judges, Rekha Borana and Sameer Jain have been chosen from the advocate quota, while Uma Shankar Vyas has been chosen from judicial officers’ quota. Their names had been approved by the law ministry on Thursday. The high court is looking forward to having four more judges after the Supreme Court collegium has recommended their names which if approved by the law ministry will take up the total strength of judges at the high court to 34. Of these four names, three are from advocates’ quota, which include Kuldeep Mathur, Ganesh Ram Meena and Manish Sharma while the fourth Shubha Mehta is from judicial officers’ quota. It may be noted that a delegation of the Rajasthan High Court Advocates’ Association had met Union law minister Kiren Rijiju this July urging him to fill the vacant posts of judges in the high court, which had gone below half of total sanctioned strength of 50 judges.President of the association Nathu Singh Rathore said that the high court has got nine judges this month and with four more in the list, work in the courts could be seen expedited, which would help in reducing the pendency. “But there should be a continuous appointment of judges so there was no shortage and the objective of providing justice to the masses in time could be achieved,” he said adding that Justice Goverdhan Bardhar was retiring on October 31, which will again bring the total strength down to 29. The last appointment of judges in the high court before this had taken place in March 2020 when 6 judicial officers had been elevated to the judgeship from judicial quota but with a short stint. Of these, one has already retired, while 4 will be retiring next year. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/with-3-new-judges-strength-in-hc-rises-to-30/articleshow/87378540.cms||---

The exemption will be applicable to colonies that were notified on or before March 31, 2019. This will make conversion cheaper for families who have been living on agricultural land of up to 300 sqm during the period of the campaign. The fee has been reduced to Rs 50 per sqm for land up to 300 sqm under the municipality; Rs 75 per sqm and Rs 100 per sqm if the land comes under municipal council and corporation, respectively. At present, the fee for registering 300 sqm of land will cost between Rs 90 and Rs 384 in various areas. The high fee has been preventing people from registering the land, forcing the government to lower it. This will also encourage residents living on these lands to convert them into non-residential lands. “The conversion will allow them and the local administration to carry out welfare schemes,” said the official press statement. The scheme is applicable for one-time payment along with paying Rs 500 for the map to acquire a freehold land deed. Other than revising the registration fees, other taxes and fees too have been waived by the state. To promote and encourage social work, the government has given 100% exemption to charitable organisations converting agricultural land into non-agricultural land. Gehlot directed officials to inform the public on exemptions and waivers made by the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-reduces-fee-toconvert-agri-landin-colonies-by-75/articleshow/87378556.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid Norms Flouted, But Fine Amount Dips By Rs 16cr Since July||New Delhi: Though it’s common to find people without masks in markets and other public places in Delhi, the monthly collection of fines from Covid protocol violators is steadily declining since July. In July, the government collected Rs 36.2 crore as fines from people violating Covid protocols, but only about Rs 30.2 crore had been collected in September. Till October 25, the district authorities collected just Rs 20.5 crore. The crowd continues to swell in markets and public places in the city in view of the festival season. Representatives from different market associations said more enforcement action was required in the marketplaces. “Since we do not have any authority to enforce mask compliance outside our shops, we can do nothing about it. When somebody enters our shops, we make sure that they are wearing masks,” said a functionary of a market association who did not want to be identified. Extensive enforcement action is most needed at this period because the footfalls in the markets, mandis, malls, etc., are very high due to festivals. Many of the visitors can be seen either not wearing masks or not properly wearing them. Covid cases are under control in the capital for a long period. It has motivated the government to open almost all economic activities, and 200 people have been allowed to attend weddings and funerals and cinemas have also been permitted to operate with 100% seating capacity. “All these steps were necessary to boost the economy and create more employment opportunities. But strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour is a must to create a balance and make sure that the gains made in Covid management are not lost,” said a trader. West Bengal and Assam are reporting an increase in Covid cases and weekly positivity rates. The Centre has asked governments of these states to ensure enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. The enforcement action had increased significantly in Delhi between May and July when the rampaging second Covid wave tore through the city. In May, 85,175 challans were issued, which increased to 1,58,341 in June and 2,11,267 in July, but the total number of monthly challans has started decreasing since August. Only 1,81,103 challans were issued in August, 1,69,370 in September and only 1,04,270 in October (till 25th). A Delhi government official said, “Strict instructions have been given to officers at district level to ensure the enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. They have also been asked to keep educating the public to wear their masks and follow social distancing as the pandemic is still not over.” Another official said the enforcement teams were deployed in the districts and extensive enforcement action was going on in the wake of the festivals. “Earlier, teachers were also engaged in enforcement action, but since the schools have opened, we are facing some manpower issues,” said the official who did not want to be identified. In the DDMA meeting held on Monday, stress was given on strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent any resurgence of infection particularly in view of the ongoing festival season. At present, 156 enforcement teams are deployed across the capital with 129 enforcement vehicles. The focus areas are mandis, ISBTs, railway stations, shops, malls, markets, complexes, weekly markets, restaurants and other hotspots across 11 districts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/covid-norms-flouted-but-fine-amount-dips-by-rs-16cr-since-july/articleshow/87409076.cms||AlokKNMishra

The general body of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Friday gave its approval to the proposal of the civic administration to set up the IT Park. Initially, the IT park is to be set up on 10 acres owned by the civic body and land adjacent to it will be acquired from the respective owners. The proposed IT park project is the brainchild of city mayor Satish Kulkarni, who had called a special general body meeting on the issue. The general body meeting was held offline for the first time in the past one-and-a-half years. Kulkarni said though there was a huge potential for the IT sector, the city was still lagging despite its proximity to Mumbai and Pune. “IT engineers and graduates from here have to go to other metro cities, such as Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad,in search of job. We have accordingly decided to develop Nashik as an IT hub. The proposed IT Parp is a part of this plan,” he said. The civic administration has proposed an initial amount of Rs10 crore for the project this financial year. The NMC has acquired 10 acres near Adgaon. The land is reserved under public amenities space. The proposed IT park will be located around 10km from the Ozar airport. Besides, the NMC has plans to acquire land adjacent to the existing 10 acres and expressions of interest will be invited from the owners to get their land for the project. It will be decided later whether to develop the IT Park in a joint venture with the land owners or opt for the public private partnership.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/gb-approves-nmcs-proposal-of-it-park-in-adgaon-locality/articleshow/87374388.cms||Tushar Pawar

Banerjee, who is on a maiden three-day visit to Goa, said unlike Congress and other opposition parties which “compromise” with BJP, TMC would not sell itself to the saffron party. Spelling out her party’s intentions to contest all 40 assembly seats in the 2022 assembly elections in Goa, Banerjee also tried to assuage concerns that the Bengal outfit was trying to encroach into the state’s political landscape. “Let Goans rule Goa. Dilli ka dadagiri band hona chahiye,” she said. After securing a thumping win in the Bengal election, TMC is trying to increase its national footprint and aims to make inroads in Goa. Justifying her party’s entry in the state, Banerjee blamed Congress for not shouldering the mantle of the opposition party both nationally and in the state. “There are other political parties, but they are not taking initiative. The other parties surrender, we never surrender or compromise. We want to see first the credentials, commitment and sincerity of the parties,” she said. “If TMC is strong, they will realise and come to us. If TMC is not strong, they will go to BJP,” Banerjee said. She also lashed out at Congress for the number of MLAs who defected and joined BJP. After 2017 polls, Congress emerged as the single largest party with 17 MLAs but are now left with just 4 members in the 40-member House. Asking Goan voters to give her party a chance, Banerjee said, “You (Congress) can’t control your MLAs. You can’t make a decision at the appropriate moment. You allowed BJP to form the government. Who can say it won’t happen again?” She advocated for a strong federal structure that could counter the concentration of power in the hands of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “My agenda is very clear, let Goa run from Goa. We want to see the federal structure is strong. We want to see a strong Union of states,” she said. Banerjee said BJP often called her anti-Hindu though it had no authority to give her a character certificate. “I am a Hindu. Who are you to give me a character certificate? I feel guilty because all this had never happened before. I will die but I will never divide the country. We unite people, we don’t divide them,” she said, adding that her party— TMC— stands for “temple, mosque and church”. Banerjee interacted with the fishing community at Malim jetty at Betim, and promised to increase the subsidy for fishermen from Rs 30,000 to Rs 75,000. She also met civil society members later in the evening. “We are ready to die, but we are not going to bow down our head to BJP or the dictators or the atrocious people who are ruling the country in the name of enforcement agencies, Income Tax (authorities) and those who torture civil society,” she said while speaking to the civil society members. One of the participants urged Banerjee to form an alliance with the opposition parties if TMC is serious about defeating BJP. “If anyone is interested in working with us, we are open to it. But past experience is that alliances don’t work,” Banerjee said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/wont-sell-ourselves-to-bjp-will-stop-its-dadagiri-culture-mamata/articleshow/87378560.cms||Newton Sequeira

Their time of death and other details are yet to be verified, said a South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official on the condition of anonymity. With the recent rise in dengue cases and deaths in some cases, hospitals have started submitting reports to the civic bodies, which are responsible for field investigation, verification and compilation of the data. In total, 34 death reports have come from different hospitals, said the official. “These include details of eight patients from Apollo Hospital and 11 from Safdarjung Hospital. These were examined by an expert committee, also including officials from Delhi government, which verified the reason of deaths and submitted its initial report on Friday,” the official explained. “Of the 34 reports received from hospitals in Delhi, 13 died of dengue and the rest due to comorbidities/other reasons. And out of these 13 people, six belong to Delhi. Their deaths took place between July and October,” said the south corporation official. The official said that people with dengue-like symptoms were coming in large numbers from neighbouring states for better treatment in Delhi’s hospitals. “But as per standard procedure, we don’t mention them in the weekly count of patients/deaths due to dengue.” Dengue cases in the city have crossed the 1,000 mark and had reached 1,006 till October 23. In comparison, 489 dengue cases were reported till this time last year. Of the total cases reported so far, 665 were reported in just October. During October 2020, 346 dengue cases were reported, 787 cases were reported in October 2019 and 1,114 cases were witnessed in October 2018. September and October are considered to be the peak months for dengue infection. Till October 23, maximum cases (98) were reported in SDMC areas followed by the north corporation (71), 36 in the east corporation and six in New Delhi Municipal Council. Sixty-eight patients were untraced after investigation. The first dengue death was officially declared last week of a 35-year-old woman from Sarita Vihar who died in a private hospital. Her death was examined and confirmed by the expert committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/panel-confirms-six-deaths-in-city-due-to-dengue-this-season/articleshow/87378562.cms||Vibha Sharma

The recovery, which is the highest this year for the EPFO regional commissionorate office headquarered at Aurangabad, has been made from the university after a span of 27 years. EPFO regional commissioner Jagdish Tambe said, “The PF amount of over 2,000 employees, who worked with this educational institute in the past three decades, was pending. It has finally been recovered.” Those privy to the development said the uiversity was of the view that it has an exemption from contributing its share of the PF to the account of its employees. The difference of opinion between te University and EPFO resulted into a long legal battle, with the matter even going to the high co)urt that remanded it back to the EPFO for hearing. After several rounds of hearings before different authorities, PF commissioner Tambe, on September 30, issued directives for initiating steps to recover the outstanding amount from the university. However, failing to get any positive response, the decision to freeze university’s bank account was taken. This was followed by enforcement officer Ganesh Khaire getting a demand draft prepared from the State Bank of India’s Parbhani branch, in favour of the EPFO and recovered the funds. Senior PF officials maintained that this action will be followed by the EPFO taking steps to recover the damages. “The damages are yet to be recovered and it could be equal to what has been recovered,” an EPFO official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aurangabad-pf-of-rs-4-crore-recovered-from-agri-varsity/articleshow/87374393.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Rajkumar was an ardent devotee of Siddharoodha Mutt, and so was Puneeth, who used to often visit the religious place. Having a special bonding with Hubblli-Dharawd, Puneeth preferred to shoot his movies here. His last release ‘Yuvaratna’ is one among the many films shot here. Theatreperson Yashavant Sardeshpande recalled his association with ‘Appu’ (that’s how he is fondly called) as a script writer for ‘Kannadada Kotyadhipati-2’ in 2013. “We worked together for some eight months. I used to add a line of moral lesson for every episode, which he liked. He was a sincere artiste and a great learner on the set. Puneeth used to say that his mother (Parvatamma) had told him to watch my plays. He wished to watch my play ‘Raashi Chakra’, but that could not happen. We had a tele talk during the shooting of ‘Yuvaratna’ at Karnatak College (Dharwad). He addressed me as ‘sir’, much to my embarrassment,” he said. Sardeshpande’s wife Malati said she had acted with ‘Appu’ in movies ‘Raam’ and Namma Basava’. Subhash Kattimani, a contractor from Dharwad, said he had a chance meeting with ‘Appu’ in 2006. “It was while his movie ‘Ajay’ was being shot at Dharwad railway station. We spotted him while passing by a parked van. When we asked him for an autograph, he obliged by signing below the photo of Saint Siddharoodha which was in a calendar,” he said.. Mahendra Singhi, former chairman of Sri Siddharoodha Swamy Mutt Trust, said Rajkumar never missed having the darshan of Siddharoodha during his visits to Hubballi. “His sons, including Appu, too followed the same,” he said. Rajat Ullagaddimath, a politician, shared his moments with Appu during the shooting of ‘Dodmane Huduga’. “Many of his major movies were shot in Dharwad, Belagavi and other districts of the region. He is fond of north Karnataka dishes like jowar roti. He mingled with us like a friend,” he said. ‘Pruthvi’, wherein Puneeth played a tough bureaucrat, highlighted the fallout of illegal mining in Ballari region. The young actor had visited Dharwad for 3-4 days in 2019 to shoot ‘Yuvaratna’, where he played the role of a college lecturer. Puneeth was overwhelmed by sight of the imposing monumental building of Karnataka College. Thousands of students had gathered at the two campuses when the shooting was on. However all through the shoot, Puneeth remained cool and posed for photos/ selfies with fans during breaks. In the initial days of acting, Puneeth had visited Dharwad to participate in a concert, a fundraiser for police stadium in Dharwad. The family of Rajkumar had camped at Dharwad SP’s bungalow. The host of the concert was the then SP Kempaiah, a close friend of Rajkumar family. “Besides enjoying the environs of Dharwad, Puneeth had relished sea food prepared by Shanbhags of Dharwad and enjoyed local specials pedha, mirchi and girmit,” said Basu Malipatil, who was looking after the food arrangement for the family.

Though the water level reached red alert level on Thursday night 2,398.31ft it declined to 2,398.30ft after 4pm on Friday and the alert was changed to orange. Saju M P, assistant engineer, KSEB, said that only a small quantity of water was released from Mullaperiyar and it would not have any impact on Idukki reservoir. “At present, we have decided to open the shutters of Cheruthoni reservoir when the water level reaches the upper rule curve level of 2,399.31ft. We have taken permission to open the shutters if any emergency situation emerges,” said the official. “At least 16mcm of water should reach the reservoir to show an increase of one feet. The water released from Mullapperiyar is only 825 cusecs (cubic feet per second), which is not enough to make an impact on Idukki reservoir,” said Saju. “As Idukki reservoir has a huge catchment area, the amount of water being released now from Mullaperiyar will not make any direct impact within hours,” he added. In addition, the rule curve for Idukki reservoir will change from November 1 onwards. As per the new rule curve, the red alert level is 2,398.78ft while the upper rule level will be 2,399.78. “In the last 24 hours, only 0.12% water has flown into the dam. It will take at least two-three days to know what impact the release of water from Mullaperiyar dam has on the water level in Idukki reservoir,” said the official. The water level in the reservoir fell from 2,398.32ft at10am to 2,398.30ft by 4pm. The absence of rainfall in the catchment area, which received only 4mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours, has also resulted in the decrease in the water level. At 14.916mu, the power generation in the Moolamattom power plant of Idukki reservoir was the maximum on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kseb-defers-opening-cheruthoni-dam-shutters-as-water-level-dips/articleshow/87377200.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Chandigarh||2 women tourists killed, 4 rescued as raft capsizes in Beas||Manali: Two women tourists -- one from Mumbai and another from Indore -- were killed while four others were rescued after a the raft they were riding capsized in the Beas near Chharuru in Kullu on Friday afternoon, according to police. The group of 11 women had reached Manali on Wednesday. They visited various tourist spots around Manali on Thursday and decided to try rafting the next day. They hired two rafts from Babeli rafting point and six of them got on the first one. The raft capsized near Chharuru, landing the women in the freezing Beas waters, and resulted in the death of two of them. Kullu superintendent of police Gurdev Chand Sharma said two women died on the spot while others were rescued. “The deceased have been identified as Rukiya Dahodwala, 75, resident of Cotton Green, Mumbai and Sakera Bombaywala, 53,from Indore, MP. Suram Singh, guide of the raft and Bawju, guide of the second raft carrying five women, managed to rescue four women from the river,” he said. Although strict safety rules are framed for rafting operators and licence is given only after ensuring that quality equipment is used, many tourists lose their lives while rafting in the Beas. According to experts, capsizing of the raft while negotiating water rapids is normal, but life jackets save the rafters from drowning. Sometimes persons onboard get buried under rafts which can be fatal. But, experts say the chilling cold water of Beas is the main killer. When people, especially tourists from plains, suddenly fall into river water with near-zero temperature, the movement of the body is limited due to the sudden fall in temperature, and can prove fatal. Thousands of tourists visit Kullu-Manali every day and many of them go for rafting in Beas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/2-women-tourists-killed-4-rescued-as-raft-capsizes-in-beas/articleshow/87378566.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: No Chhath puja allowed along Yamuna||NEW DELHI: Delhi government started preparations on Friday for organising Chhath puja across the city after Delhi Disaster Management Authority issued a detailed order specifying guidelines for the sun festival in the Covid era. No Chhath puja will be allowed on the Yamuna banks, only at sites designated by the district authorities in consultation with the Chhath puja committees and other stakeholders. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot met with district magistrates and revenue department officials on Friday and asked them to hold meetings with the Chhath puja organising committees to designate sites and provide facilities like lighting, tents, mobile toilets, etc, at the sites. Delhi has 1,078 identified waterbodies for Chhath puja, most of them artificial ponds in parks and on government and private land. Some are located on the Yamuna riverbanks. The DDMA order says Chhath puja “shall be allowed only at designated sites outside containment zones with the requisite permission from district magistrate concerned and subject to the compliance of guidelines and restrictions”. The ban on the puja on the Yamuna banks surprised BJP functionaries. Manoj Tiwari expressed shock at the decision. “This is completely unacceptable,” Tiwari said, urging CM Arvind Kejriwal to take the necessary steps to permit Chhath puja at the riverside sites. The designated sites will be identified, developed and managed by the DMs in coordination with government departments and agencies such as Delhi Jal Board, DDA and municipal corporations. At the designated sites, people can offer or consign puja material, which will then be collected by the civic authorities for immediate and proper disposal. The DDMA order also states that all devotees will be prohibited from throwing pooja material or any other stuff like food grain, oil, etc., into the Yamuna and will hold the district DCPs responsible for violations. DDMA has stressed on strict measures to ensure prevention and control of pollution in the Yamuna and its floodplain. Chhath puja organisers have been asked to submit an undertaking to the respective DM with regards to the norms on pollution and other pandemic-related guidelines. The authorities have been asked to ensure strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing of mask, maintenance of social distancing, regular hand washing and use of sanitiser at the sites. DDMA has asked the district authorities to convene meetings with religious and community leaders, Chhath puja committees and other stakeholders to brief them about the guidelines so that they can, on their part, further sensitise the public to the need for strict compliance with Covid norms and other guidelines. Kamal Bansal, chairman of Delhi government’s Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti, said that a majority of the Chhath ghats would be located in parks and on government and private lands.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-chhath-puja-allowed-along-yamuna/articleshow/87378574.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Aurangabad||Police approach CERT-IN to curb online gambling||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad police have approached the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) and requested it to block the websites that are providing unchecked platforms for different types of betting, including on cricket matches. CERT-IN is the nodal agency that deals with cybersecurity threats and works under the Union ministry of electronics and information technology. It also acts as the national incident response centre for major computer incidents in India. Geeta Bagwade, the inspector at the Osmanpur police station, said rampant betting has come to the notice after her team nabbed four people who were sitting on the roadside and placing bets on IPL matches using their mobile phones. The police, during the probe, found that there are certain mobile-based applications on which one has to register himself/herself. The application owners then appoint individuals as bookies or agents in different cities. The gambler has to transfer the betting amount through e-wallet to these bookies or agents, against which they are issued online coins to place bets on matches. Bagwade, who had earlier served as the head of cyber police station, said, “Through the cyber police station, we have reached out to CERT-IN and requested it to ban these platforms and websites.” She said as the betting is being conducted through online platforms, keeping a check on such activities is a daunting task. Sources said that as per the information provided by the four suspects, the agent representing this application is being tracked. The cyber police have opined that to keep a check on illegal gambling activities, the suspects caught for placing or accepting online bets should be slapped with non-bailable sections of the Information Technology Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/police-approach-cert-in-to-curb-online-gambling/articleshow/87374410.cms||Mohammed Akhef

On Thursday afternoon, pet parent Swani Dey found Leo had gone missing while his mother Michhi was wailing. “I had been looking for Leo everywhere until I spotted her on the other side of the airport wall from our terrace. But I had no clue how to get her back. I ran to a CISF official guarding a watchtower but he said he couldn’t leave the post and we needed permission to enter,” said Dey, a first-year PG student By 11.30pm, one of Dey’s friends posted a tweet tagging civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. “Our home is alongside the airport wall of Kolkata airport.

The order modified a recent West Bengal Pollution Control Board notification allowing use of “green crackers” for a two-hour window during Diwali and Kali Puja. “Again the judiciary has become the saviour of the environment after PCB issued an order which would have led to more pollution. Green crackers are almost impossible to differentiate from conventional crackers by look and feel. Hence, a complete ban was the only sensible decision,” said green crusader Subhas Dutta. Times ViewThere was a lot of confusion among citizens regarding what was allowed and what was banned. This directive has taken care of all the problems. It now needs to be seamlessly implemented on the ground. And citizens have as much responsibility here as enforcing agencies.A division bench comprising justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Aniruddha Roy had passed the order on a petition seeking re-imposition of the ban on firecrackers, as was ordered by the court in 2020. “The ban will help send a message of restraint. This follows the Pujas when all Covid protocols were tossed out of the window. We have been toying with this idea for a long time, but the ban has never been very effective. Hopefully, this time it will work. said pulmonologist Raja Dhar. TOI on Friday had highlighted the concerns regarding identification of green crackers and how the city was on the brink of getting flooded with conventional polluting crackers with not a single green cracker manufacturing unit in Bengal and thousands of sellers stocking “now-illegal” crackers for two years. “The order has been a death nail to our industry. We have been in this trade for generations. We also want to change with times and do our part for the environment. But banning sale of crackers just a week before the puja two years in a row is not the right approach. We pay our taxes on time. The government or whichever authority concerned should buy our stock in cost price and then do whatever they want with it. But this order will leave several households in jeopardy,” said Santanu Dutta, treasurer of Burrabazar Firecracker Dealers’ Association. Meanwhile, cops seized over 200kg of banned firecrackers and expressed relief over the fact that they would not have to search for “green crackers” and look out for QR codes on boxes any more. “We can now focus on preventing sale, transit or burning of crackers in our jurisdictions,” said an officer.

So far, the committee has examined extremely crucial witnesses, including journalists, fact-checkers, digital rights activists and Facebook employees, who have given evidence and suggestions. The committee issued a notice to Facebook India Online Services Private Limited on October 27 to depose before it at 12.30pm on November 2. It is examining the riots to recommend suitable measures to defuse the situation and restore harmony among religious and linguistic communities or social groups. The proceedings would be live-streamed to maintain transparency. In the opinion of the committee, social media has a very important role in curbing the spread of false, provocative and malicious messages, which can fan violence and disharmony. Since Facebook has lakhs of users in Delhi, the committee has decided to hear the views of the company’s representatives. “The summons is being issued to Facebook in furtherance of the July 8 judgment of the Supreme Court in Ajit Mohan & Ors vs Legislative Assembly, NCT of Delhi where the court upheld the powers of the committee to summon both members and non-members, including representatives of Facebook,” the committee, chaired by AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fake-messages-house-panel-to-call-fb-reps/articleshow/87378583.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Covid vaccination pace slows down, 75,000 to take second dose||CHANDIGARH: When it came to the second dose, the pace of vaccination has slowed down, settling on an average of 3,400 weekly doses over the last two months. With 75k persons still left to take the second dose, the city may complete immunisation against Covid by December-end. Chandigarh completed its 100% first dose coverage a month ago. The gap between two doses of Covishield is 12 weeks and for Covaxin it is four weeks. TimesViewVaccination is the only protection against Covid-19, so people should ensure that they are fully vaccinated. The hesitancy or carelessness in going for the second dose is inexplicable. The case count may be less at the moment, but they should remember that the virus mutates to more deadly variants and many parts of the world are seeing a surge in cases again“We have 84 days between the first dose and the second dose. The Cowin system cannot pick up beneficiaries unless the prescribed gap is over,” said UT director, health services Dr Suman Singh. On Thursday, the health department had listed 75,526 cases of people who had been administered the first dose of Covishield more than 16 weeks ago. Out of these, 110 patients had been administered Covaxin from private hospitals. The Cowin app notifies beneficiaries a day in advance to come for the second dosage. “Till immunisation is complete, there is no defence built against the virus. Therefore, ahead of festivities, one should complete the immunisation,” said a doctor in PGI. Eleven states and UTs which completed second dose coverage to more than 50% eligible beneficiaries are Lakshwadweep, Sikkim, Goa, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Daman and Diu, Arunachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Public health experts feel there are many reasons for the slow pace of the second dose. “Due to the long gap between the doses and people who have started going out for work, there is laxity for the second jab. Also, the number of Covid cases have come down and there is no fear of contracting the virus,” said a public health expert. He added, “There are some who have given registered mobiles of their relatives who are not based locally and they have not been informed about the second schedule.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/vaccination-pace-slows-down-75k-to-take-second-dose/articleshow/87377184.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The district now has 651 active covid cases as against 734 last week, a health official at the civil hospital said. The number of active cases in Nashik rural has also dropped to 389 from 476 during the past seven days. The situation in Sinnar, Niphad and Yeola is improving with the cases either dropping from what it was last week or are at the same levels. “The number in Yeola taluka dropped from 67 to 40, while Sinnar and Niphad showed marginal improvement,” said Dr Shailesh Nikam, taluka health officer of Nashik. The active cases in Nashik city remained almost the same as the figures marginally increased by seven. In the rural areas, the health official said, surveillance in villages neighbouring Ahmednagar district, where the cases of infection are still on the higher side, has helped in ensuring better results. The weekly positivity rate in Nashik district was currently around 2.05%. The health administration has warned the people against taking the situation lightly. “This is Diwali season and a large number of people are travelling. It remains to be seen what is the number of infection during the 15 days after the Diwali vacation. Since vaccination drive is doing good, we are confident that the number of infection could be less,” said Dr Nikam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/active-covid-cases-in-nashik-district-drop-in-past-1-week/articleshow/87374420.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Two snatching, harassment cases in 12 hours in New Town||KOLKATA: A young woman was allegedly teased and tormented by strangers on a bike while she was strolling inside her New Town complex. In another incident, an elderly woman alleged that she had been robbed of her handbag by two bikers during her morning walk outside her complex in New Town. Both the incidents happened within 12 hours between Thursday evening and Friday morning. The residents of New Town raised allegations regarding laxity in police patrolling after Durga Puja. A month ago, the residents had a series of meetings with the police after multiple incidents of snatching and teasing in the township. The rise in such incidents had led to the formation of a residents’ resistance group while cops formed special morning and evening patrol teams for the protection of walkers. “I was taking a stroll this evening and there was a girl all dolled up, probably going somewhere.. Suddenly, 3 youths on a bike started eve teasing her, whistling at her, made her so uncomfortable and went away. The reason I’m mentioning this is because a month ago, I faced something along the same lines near C gate where 4 men in a black SUV came and behaved in the most ridiculous manner possible,” a young professional wrote on Facebook on Thursday, adding that the untoward incident happened inside the sprawling Sukhabrishti Complex in New Town, where two dreaded Punjab gangsters had taken shelter and were gunned down in an encounter by Bengal police four months ago. However, no complaint was lodged with the police regarding the incident on Thursday evening. On Friday, the morning walker, Tandra Ghosh (63), was targeted by two youths on a bike, who snatched her handbag, scratched her hand and left her bleeding outside her complex at BA Block in New Town. “The recent incidents of theft and snatching in the township had left me shocked, so I had stopped wearing gold jewellery or carrying too much cash or an expensive mobile with me during morning walk. On Friday, I barely had Rs 150 in my handbag, an ordinary cellphone and some biscuit packets, which I had bought to feed the street dogs. The way the bikers attacked me and snatched my bag, I could have been severely injured,” Ghosh recounted. Following repeated complaints of harassment against women, New Town residents had come together last month for discussions with cops. The police had formed a special morning patrol team and also a resistance group with citizens as volunteers who had agreed to keep a watch and inform cops about any suspected crime. However, in a month, the impetus seems to have whizzed away as the resistance group members have become inactive especially after Durga Puja. Many morning walkers rued that the patrol team can be seen after 6.30am or 7am when most of them return home. “We haven’t received any complaint of teasing from any resident of Sukhobrishti. However, a complaint has been lodged about the snatching near New Town Mela ground and we are checking CCTV footage and other electronic evidence to trace the accused. The woman couldn’t note down the registration number of the bike,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/two-snatching-harassment-cases-in-12-hrs-in-new-town/articleshow/87377198.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Baralacha pass, Nakee-la, Lachulung-la, and Taglang-la had received heavy snow in the three spells of snowfall in the last two weeks. The highway at Baralacha pass was covered with more than 120cm of snow. A military convoy successfully crossed the Baralacha pass to reach Sarchu on Friday. Officials said all vehicles in the convoy had 4X4 (four-wheel drive) vehicles and had put anti-skid snow chains on tyres. 38 Border Roads Task Force commander Col Uma Shankar said the snow from the Baralacha pass has been removed after efforts of many hours, and the highway is now open. “At present, the highway is open, but only 4X4 vehicles are being allowed. Depending on weather and surface conditions, civil administration decides on the movement of the vehicles,” he said. The snow from the highway has been cleared, but the icing on the road surface is the main problem. A layer of ice is covering the surface of the highway at most places between Zingzingbar in Lahaul and Taglang-la in Leh. With the temperature expected to dip further in the coming days, driving on the Manali-Leh highway will be very risky due to slippery road conditions. Meanwhile, Gramphu-Kaza and Darcha-Shinku-la roads are still blocked with snow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/manali-leh-highway-reopens-after-12-days/articleshow/87378584.cms||---

Four cases were reported in Chakan and one each in Pimpri and Dehu Road, police said. Cash, gold ornaments and an eye-testing machine collectively worth Rs 2 lakh were stolen in these burglaries. Balasaheb Pokharkar (48) of Yashwantnagar in Chakan filed a police complaint in which he said the burglars broke the lock of his house in the early hours of Wednesday made off with Rs 15,000 and gold ornaments worth Rs43,000. “The suspects also broke into two more houses in Pokharkar’s society and one from a neighbouring society. We are yet to ascertain the value of the booty stolen from these other houses,” an officer from the Chakan police said. On Dehu Road, burglars broke into a locked flat in Park Estate society on Tuesday and stole gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 1 lakh from a locker. The theft was discovered when the complainant, Kashinath Chaudhary (30), returned home at night. In Nighoje, two men scaled the wall of a locked company and stole copper worth Rs 20,000. The theft happened late on Tuesday night “We have taken into custody one person for questioning,” said an officer from the Mhalunge police chowkey. A woman ophthalmologist from Pimpri on Wednesday filed a complaint claiming that burglars broke into her clinic during the night intervening October 23 and 24 and stole equipment worth Rs 10,000.

---||Mumbai||Six out of 10 suicides in Maharashtra in 2020 pandemic year among poor||MUMBAI: In Covid-hit 2020, deaths by suicide in Maharashtra went up by over 5% as compared to the previous year. These addtional deaths, though, were recorded mainly in the state’s poorest section, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau report released on Thursday. In the “better off” sections, the number of suicides dropped across Maharashtra during the same period. Almost 65% (12,969) of the 19,909 deaths by suicide in Maharashtra in 2020 were among people whose annual income was less than Rs 1 lakh, showed NCRB’s Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India 2020 report. In 2019, this group made up for 60% (11,521) of the 18,916 deaths by suicide in Maharashtra. Noticeably, there was a drop in the number of deaths in the other economic brackets maintained by NCRB, the Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, and the Rs 10 lakh plus, between 2019 and 2020. Deaths by suicide in the Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh group in Maharashtra dropped from 6,660 in 2019 to 6,331 in 2020, and the corresponding drop in the Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh group was from 672 to 562. In the 10-lakh plus category, deaths dropped from 63 to 47. “Poverty has always been a higher risk factor for suicides,” said a doctor from a public hospital in Mumbai. The NCRB data, which is released annually, provides a snapshot of suicides in the country. In 2020, suicides across the country rose by 11.3% from 1.4 lakh in 2019 to 1.5 lakh in 2020. The suicide rate in cities (14.8) was higher as compared to all-India suicide rate (11.3). The most common cause for suicide was family problems (other than marriage related problems) at 33.6% while illness contributed to 18% of the cases in 2020. According to psychiatrist Harish Shetty, who is a member of the state government’s Covid task force, the NCRB 2020 report showed that the “bigger pandemic of mental health” is round the corner. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also mentioned that the Covid pandemic would take a toll on mental health; previous pandemics such as SARS and MERS were followed by a rise in depression, anxiety and sleep disorders among people. “Mental health issues deserve the same effort that the state and union governments put in managing Covid-19 and in the vaccination drive. We need a suicide prevention policy and we need to accept the new Mental Health Bill that has been on paper for years now,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-six-out-of-10-suicides-in-state-in-2020-pandemic-year-among-poor/articleshow/87378587.cms||Malathy Iyer

He will succeed Renu Swarup who has been in this role since 2018. Gokhale’s research is in immunology in the context of understanding the infectious disease tuberculosis, a press release from IISER, Pune, said. He has a PhD from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore and a postdoctoral degree from Stanford University. He joined the faculty of the National Institute of Immunology (NII), Delhi. From 2009 to 2016, he was Director of CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Delhi. Gokhale’s work has been recognised through several awards including the Infosys Prize in Life Sciences in 2013 and Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in biological sciences in 2006. Gokhale’s homepage on the IISER Pune’s website says that the present focus is to elucidate the interplay between metabolic reprogramming and immunity in the context of infectious disease tuberculosis. Clinical treatment of infectious diseases has often focussed on efficient pathogen elimination and disease severity has been assumed to be a direct function of pathogen burden. This perspective has failed to explain several complexities of TB pathogenesis, such as wasting syndrome cachexia (a condition associated with progressive loss of muscle mass and functions). Infection by pathogens can trigger a variety of responses in hosts that as a consequence could result in multisystem dysfunction and pathology. Future intervention strategies developed based on these considerations are likely to maximize patients’ survival and also their health-related quality of life, the website says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rajesh-gokhale-from-iiser-pune-appointed-dbt-secretary/articleshow/87344493.cms||---

DDMA is chaired by the lieutenant governor. In a letter to the CM, Tiwari pleaded that people should not be stopped from organising Chhath puja on the banks of the Yamuna. Meanwhile, BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh announced that he will defy the DDMA ban and facilitate Chhath puja celebrations near the river and dared the CM to stop him. Aam Aadmi Party MLA Sanjeev Jha wrote to LG Anil Baijal explaining that during Chhath puja, no idol immersion takes place and in fact, the devotees clean the riverbanks for the purpose of the puja. Jha sought an appointment with the LG over the matter. “Kejriwal ji, you are a member of DDMA. Why did you maintain silence in the DDMA meeting? Why did your government not send a proposal (to DDMA) for holding Chhath puja on Yamuna banks? You remained silent because you were against Chhath puja since the beginning,” Tiwari stated in a tweet. Tiwari urged the AAP government to make public the proposal on Chhath puja it put up before DDMA. Tiwari demanded that an emergency meeting of DDMA should be convened and BJP MPs should also be invited to join the meeting to discuss the issue. Aam Aadmi Party MLA Jha has argued that people have been celebrating Chhath puja every year on the banks of the Yamuna. Chhath puja is celebrated in sync with nature, he stated. Meanwhile, the Delhi government has started preparations for organising Chhath puja at designated sites across the city and DDMA has issued a detailed order specifying guidelines for holding the festival in the wake of the prevailing Covid pandemic. Devotees have been allowed to hold puja only at sites designated by the district authorities in consultation with the Chhath puja committees and other stakeholders. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot recently held a meeting with DMs and revenue department officials and asked them to hold meetings with the Chhath puja organising committees to designate sites and also start preparations for providing necessary facilities such as lighting, tents, mobile toilets, etc., at these sites.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/clamour-for-chhath-by-the-yamuna/articleshow/87409166.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In five wards, you can soon scan on signage and get street smart||MUMBAI: Ever wondered what's the significance behind renaming Pedder Road after Gopalrao Deshmukh, or who is Sofia Zuber from Nagpada’s road with the same name? A QR-coded road-mapping project aims to give information on the history behind street names, besides public amenities on it, which internet searches may not always throw up.  The initiative will provide police station jurisdictions for every bylane which will make reporting of crimes easier for complainants. QR codes will be affixed on revamped street signage and people can point their phones at the signs to scan codes for information. Helmed jointly by the municipal corporation and non-profit Project Mumbai, the initiative will cover five civic wards before expanding to the rest of the city. “The municipal corporation has more than 2,200km of roads. Many are named after personalities who have made an immense contribution to the city that people may not be aware of,” said additional commissioner (projects) P Velrasu. Zuber, for instance, was an education superintendent for Urdu affiliated to the civic body and later a corporator from Nagpada. The street used to serve as a meeting spot for Urdu writers and journalists. Typically, people refer to street names colloquially or in an abbreviated form, which makes the process of finding an address difficult for the unfamiliar. People wanting to report a crime, such as a mugging or a road rage episode, may not be able to figure out which police station has jurisdiction or how to reach it. National Service Scheme (NSS) students have been roped in as volunteers to collect data on street names for the project. “We have 15,000 NSS students in Mumbai. Students will undergo basic training before picking a street closest to home and researching the history behind its name. They will walk along the street and subsequently fill out details on public utilities and landmarks,” said Prof Sudhir Puranik, NSS director. The details will be communicated to Project Mumbai, which has involved historians for verification and additional inputs. “We plan to include information on bus-stops, parking lots, hospitals and educational institutions on each street,” said Shishir Joshi, CEO of Project Mumbai. For the pilot project, civic wards A, D, G South, K East and T, which largely cover south and central Mumbai, and few parts of eastern and western suburbs, have been selected. Mumbai Police is sharing details of its police stations and beat chowkies with researchers. Identification of roads and segregation of ground teams has begun and the project will be ready in a month. Volunteers will simultaneously collect data on city streets and not limit themselves to the five wards. “Mumbai is an illustrious city with a fascinating history. It needs to come alive for its citizens. This initiative is an effort in that direction," said Joshi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-in-five-wards-you-can-soon-scan-qr-on-signage-and-get-street-smart/articleshow/87378633.cms||Nitasha Natu

Deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI on Thursday, “The contractor has alleged in his complaint that the corporator and his aides failed to get him civic works in Wanowrie and refused to return his money.” TOI made repeated attempts to contact the corporator but his phone was switched off.

---||Delhi||After Covid pause, demand up for shoulder surgeries||New Delhi: Many people who had been delaying elective surgeries in view of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic are now queuing up at hospitals to get operated. People suffering from debilitating pain in their shoulders are also among them. Orthopaedic surgeons in the city's private hospitals say that demand for key-hole surgeries to repair rotator cuff tear in the shoulder joint has increased by 20% to 40%. A rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the shoulder joint like a cuff. It can be torn either due to trauma or age-related degeneration. “Many of these patients could have avoided surgery if they approached a specialist in time and followed non-surgical interventions such as physiotherapy. But they didn’t, fearing they would get infected in the hospital,” Dr Deepak Chaudhary, director of arthroscopy and sports centre at BLK super-specialty hospital said. He added that any shoulder pain associated with weakness lasting for more than two to three months should not be taken lightly. Dr J Maheshwari from Max Saket also confirmed the trend. “Rotator cuff tear is one of the commonest orthopaedic problems seen in the elderly population. It is usually related to age-related degeneration but can also be caused due to trauma. We have certainly observed an increase in footfall for surgeries in such cases,” he said. He, however, clarified that the increase could be due to the pent up demand as many people decided to wait until the pandemic receded. Dr Maheshwari, who heads the knee and shoulder services at Max Saket, stressed on the need to remain physically active. “Most people go for a walk or jog, which helps maintain overall physical health and strengthens the lower limbs. However, it would be better to follow a few upper limb exercises as well to keep shoulder pain and other such lifestyle problems at bay,” he added. According to the specialists, at a time when imaging services such as MRI are readily available, patients shouldn’t be put on long-term physiotherapy and pain medications without correct diagnosis. “Earlier, most people didn’t want to get shoulder repair surgeries done until it was disabling. However, in the last few years, we have seen that people who have severe pain in shoulder caused due to rotator cuff tear or impingement syndrome want to get surgical repair done to lead an active life,” says Dr Aashish Chaudhary, director of orthopaedics at Akash Super Specialty Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/after-covid-pause-demand-up-for-shoulder-surgeries/articleshow/87409332.cms||---

---||Pune||At COP26, chance for India to change narratives, says Aaditya Thackeray||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government in association with TEDxGateway will be hosting virtually the country’s biggest climate change congregation ‘TEDxGateway Countdown 2021’ on Sunday. This is being held a day before COP26, where many countries will discuss matters on climate over two weeks, begins in Glasgow. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, the co-curator of the event, talks exclusively to TOI about his expectations from the Centre, state’s efforts to combat climate change and various policies. Excerpts from the interview... Q. Do you think India needs to revise its Nationally Determined Contribution? What are your expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other diplomats who would be attending global climate meet COP26? A. India will have a unique role to play at COP26 because we are one of the most at risk from climate change. I hope India can step up its climate ambition, just like Maharashtra has done recently. However, to be able to take any aggressive action that we talk about, we need financial resources. This means we need to look to the global North to mobilize finance into the country. Also, only 15% of investments in ‘green finance’ are from international sources, while the rest are domestic. I believe that at COP, India has an opportunity to change this narrative and show the world that we are already acting aggressively on climate, and that we are willing to step our efforts up. Q. A large number of coal-fired power plants in the state are not just big contributors of pollution and a threat to public health but also stranded assets. At a time when various countries and states have declared 'no new coal plants', will Maharashtra take similar efforts towards energy transition? A. In the last year, the state has incurred climate-related expenses worth $2 billion. When we recently presented the latest IPCC report to the Maharashtra cabinet, the entire council of ministers was in agreement that we need to decarbonize our energy mix rapidly to ensure the state does not bear the brunt end of climate change. State’s energy minister Nitin Raut has now declared that Maharashtra will no longer set up new coal plants. It is heartening to see such strong steps towards tackling climate change from ministers across the state cabinet. In fact, as per the latest policy put out by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), the state’s share of renewable energy should go from the current 10% to 25% by 2025. Q. The UN will be urging world leaders to put emphasis on protection of trees. While in Maharashtra we have seen the government's success in protecting urban forests like Aarey, a lot of age-old trees continue to face the axe for developmental projects. With the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 being amended, how soon can the citizens expect its implementation? A. The amendment of the tree act is a unique step by our environment department to ensure that urbanisation does not go unchecked. The state government is determined to implement a scientific approach to conservation to usher in sustainable development. To ensure this, the tree authorities will have ‘tree experts’ empanelled. We are currently in the process of vetting these experts. As soon as we select these experts, the state tree authority will be activated and will start taking up cases. Q. How do you plan to prevent large-scale tree felling in government-owned development projects? A. We have put in place several policies that address key aspects of climate change and urbanisation. In just under 2 years of this government, we have managed to bring over 9,800 hectares of mangroves under statutory protection and saved 808 acres of Aarey forest – Mumbai’s green lungs. In addition, Mumbai is also signatory to the World Resources Institute’s Cities4Forests initiative and the C40 Cities Urban Nature Declaration. Through these international initiatives, the city is taking its local climate action to the global level. The story of Mumbai gives me hope that no matter how we develop, we will strive to ensure that our cities are shining examples of diverse ecosystems thriving in dense urban environments. Q. The state has been reeling under the effects of climate catastrophes. What are the government's agendas when it comes to climate adaptation, mitigation and finance? A. Majhi Vasundhara, our climate change mitigation and adaptation programme, incentivizes local bodies to take certain climate actions including increase in green cover and biodiversity, waste management waste, air quality monitoring, promoting the use of electric vehicles, creating charging infrastructure, conserving water, promoting use of renewable energy, shift to low carbon electricity and generate awareness for climate action amongst citizens. In just one year of the program, we were able to achieve a significant impact across Maharashtra – in terms of both, climate change mitigation and adaptation. This programme not only helps us push our local bodies to act on climate urgently, but also serves as a monitoring framework to ensure that the policies we put out at the state level are effectively implemented on ground. Q. Maharashtra’s transition to electric mobility is a promising global strategy to curb decarbonisation. However, some experts have been raising doubts over the requirement of charging infrastructure. How will the state meet this need? A. The electric vehicles transition is incomplete without the provision of adequate charging infrastructure. While we are focusing on transitions public and private fleets to electric, our policy also includes provisions for promoting charging infrastructure in urban agglomerations and key highways in the state. The ambitious targets are backed by our policy which mandates cities to set up at least one public charging station in a 3 km x 3 km grid or a minimum of 50 charging stations per million population, whichever is higher. We have also mandated the setup of public charging stations at a 25 km distance on both sides of the highways mentioned above.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/at-cop26-chance-for-india-to-change-narratives-says-aaditya/articleshow/87391626.cms||Manka Behl

One of the criminals snatched the guard Amarjeet Singh’s phone and threatened him to keep quiet. When the guard resisted, he was assaulted and made to sit on a chair. One of the criminals examined the ATM and then sat down with a gas cutter to cut open the cash box. Another robber noticed that they had been spotted by a passerby, so he ran out and caught hold of him. The man, later identified as Ramesh Baba, was also made to sit inside the booth. After cutting out the cash box, the robbers kept it in their WagonR and sped away. The criminals threw the guard’s mobile phone on the road while fleeing. The entire process took about 45 minutes and no cops were spotted in the vicinity. DCP Benita Mary Jaikar said the PCR got a call regarding the robbery at the ATM kiosk in Masjid Moth by 3-4 men around 6am. “Cops from CR Park police station reached the spot and questioned the security guard,” she added. Later in the evening, police confirmed that the cash box had at least Rs 18 lakh in it. An FIR of armed robbery has been lodged and teams formed to catch the criminals. The footage from CCTV cameras of the ATM and nearby areas is being scanned for clues. Police suspect the getaway car was a stolen one. Criminals from Sangam Vihar, Madangir, etc and some gangs from Mewat region in Haryana are under the scanner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/robbers-hold-guard-at-gunpoint-escape-with-atm-cash-box/articleshow/87378749.cms||---

---||Kochi||Not satisfied with DGP’s affidavit: HC||Kochi: The high court on Friday criticized the state police over the long delay in probing the tall claims made by ‘antique collector’ Monson Mavunkal despite then state police chief Loknath Behera himself doubting the genuineness of antiques during his visit to Monson’s house in May 2019. The HC said it was not satisfied with state police chief Anil Kant’s affidavit. In the affidavit, Kant said Behera and ADGP Manoj Abraham had developed suspicion about the genuineness of the articles and the antecedents of ‘Dr Monson Mavunkal’ during their visit. After directing a discreet intelligence inquiry in May 2019, Behera had requested the Enforcement Directorate for a detailed inquiry on February 5, 2020, the affidavit said. During the hearing on Friday, Justice Devan Ramachandran asked why the police failed to register a case against Monson if there were doubts in May 2019. The court also questioned the eight-month delay in submitting the report of the intelligence probe ordered in May 2019. Further, the court ordered that the copies of the communication and orders issued to ascertain the genuineness of Monson and his artifacts, including the order for conducting an intelligence inquiry, and the state police chief’s letter to the ED should be produced before it. Referring to the police chief’s affidavit, the court said it is silent about the allegation that Monson had close links with an expat organization and directed to inform whether anybody from outside the state is involved in the case. The court will consider the case again on November 11.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/not-satisfied-with-dgps-affidavit-hc/articleshow/87377421.cms||---

---||Nagpur||At COP26, chance for India to change narratives, says Aaditya Thackeray||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government in association with TEDxGateway will be hosting virtually the country’s biggest climate change congregation ‘TEDxGateway Countdown 2021’ on Sunday. This is being held a day before COP26, where many countries will discuss matters on climate over two weeks, begins in Glasgow. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, the co-curator of the event, talks exclusively to TOI about his expectations from the Centre, state’s efforts to combat climate change and various policies. Excerpts from the interview... Q. Do you think India needs to revise its Nationally Determined Contribution? What are your expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other diplomats who would be attending global climate meet COP26? A. India will have a unique role to play at COP26 because we are one of the most at risk from climate change. I hope India can step up its climate ambition, just like Maharashtra has done recently. However, to be able to take any aggressive action that we talk about, we need financial resources. This means we need to look to the global North to mobilize finance into the country. Also, only 15% of investments in ‘green finance’ are from international sources, while the rest are domestic. I believe that at COP, India has an opportunity to change this narrative and show the world that we are already acting aggressively on climate, and that we are willing to step our efforts up. Q. A large number of coal-fired power plants in the state are not just big contributors of pollution and a threat to public health but also stranded assets. At a time when various countries and states have declared 'no new coal plants', will Maharashtra take similar efforts towards energy transition? A. In the last year, the state has incurred climate-related expenses worth $2 billion. When we recently presented the latest IPCC report to the Maharashtra cabinet, the entire council of ministers was in agreement that we need to decarbonize our energy mix rapidly to ensure the state does not bear the brunt end of climate change. State’s energy minister Nitin Raut has now declared that Maharashtra will no longer set up new coal plants. It is heartening to see such strong steps towards tackling climate change from ministers across the state cabinet. In fact, as per the latest policy put out by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), the state’s share of renewable energy should go from the current 10% to 25% by 2025. Q. The UN will be urging world leaders to put emphasis on protection of trees. While in Maharashtra we have seen the government's success in protecting urban forests like Aarey, a lot of age-old trees continue to face the axe for developmental projects. With the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 being amended, how soon can the citizens expect its implementation? A. The amendment of the tree act is a unique step by our environment department to ensure that urbanisation does not go unchecked. The state government is determined to implement a scientific approach to conservation to usher in sustainable development. To ensure this, the tree authorities will have ‘tree experts’ empanelled. We are currently in the process of vetting these experts. As soon as we select these experts, the state tree authority will be activated and will start taking up cases. Q. How do you plan to prevent large-scale tree felling in government-owned development projects? A. We have put in place several policies that address key aspects of climate change and urbanisation. In just under 2 years of this government, we have managed to bring over 9,800 hectares of mangroves under statutory protection and saved 808 acres of Aarey forest – Mumbai’s green lungs. In addition, Mumbai is also signatory to the World Resources Institute’s Cities4Forests initiative and the C40 Cities Urban Nature Declaration. Through these international initiatives, the city is taking its local climate action to the global level. The story of Mumbai gives me hope that no matter how we develop, we will strive to ensure that our cities are shining examples of diverse ecosystems thriving in dense urban environments. Q. The state has been reeling under the effects of climate catastrophes. What are the government's agendas when it comes to climate adaptation, mitigation and finance? A. Majhi Vasundhara, our climate change mitigation and adaptation programme, incentivizes local bodies to take certain climate actions including increase in green cover and biodiversity, waste management waste, air quality monitoring, promoting the use of electric vehicles, creating charging infrastructure, conserving water, promoting use of renewable energy, shift to low carbon electricity and generate awareness for climate action amongst citizens. In just one year of the program, we were able to achieve a significant impact across Maharashtra – in terms of both, climate change mitigation and adaptation. This programme not only helps us push our local bodies to act on climate urgently, but also serves as a monitoring framework to ensure that the policies we put out at the state level are effectively implemented on ground. Q. Maharashtra’s transition to electric mobility is a promising global strategy to curb decarbonisation. However, some experts have been raising doubts over the requirement of charging infrastructure. How will the state meet this need? A. The electric vehicles transition is incomplete without the provision of adequate charging infrastructure. While we are focusing on transitions public and private fleets to electric, our policy also includes provisions for promoting charging infrastructure in urban agglomerations and key highways in the state. The ambitious targets are backed by our policy which mandates cities to set up at least one public charging station in a 3 km x 3 km grid or a minimum of 50 charging stations per million population, whichever is higher. We have also mandated the setup of public charging stations at a 25 km distance on both sides of the highways mentioned above.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/at-cop26-chance-for-india-to-change-narratives-says-aaditya/articleshow/87377418.cms||Manka Behl
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra has 770 mucormycosis cases, but not many new patients||MUMBAI: Over 770 people continue to be under treatment for mucormycosis in the state. The public health department, in an update shared recently, stated that 779 people are currently being treated for the fungal infection that swept through the state during the second wave. A total of 10,325 cases have been recorded by the state since the start of the pandemic.  Of the active cases of mucormycosis, most are in Pune (257), followed by Amravati district that has 70 cases, and Mumbai, which still has 64 cases under treatment. Districts like Akola, Gondia and Yavatmal too have 37, 30 and 58 cases being treated. The infection, known to spread rapidly if not treated on time, has claimed 1,384 lives. However, 7,967 people have recovered too, although many will have to live with deformities.  A doctor from Parel’s KEM Hospital, which had got many such referrals, said that they are not getting any fresh cases. “Most patients need multiple rounds of surgeries and the treatment is prolonged. Hence, the count of active cases takes a while to come down,” he said. Multiple analyses of mucormycosis cases had found the presence of three factors Covid infection, diabetes and use of steroids as a common thread.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-has-770-mucor-cases-but-not-many-new-patients/articleshow/87378754.cms||---
---||Delhi||Low O2 level due to early steroids? Study thinks so||New Delhi: One of the major causes of the oxygen crisis during the second wave of Covid-19 was early administration of steroids. A study conducted by AIIMS has found that patients suffering from the viral infection, who were put on steroids within a week of the onset of symptoms, were twice at risk to develop hypoxia or low oxygen saturation compared with those who were out on steroids later. The Covid-19 progression comprises three stages — early infection, pulmonary and hyper-inflammatory phase. A doctor said the second phase was a transition zone between the viraemic and the inflammatory phase. End of the pulmonary phase and beginning of the hyper-inflammatory one usually marks the onset of respiratory failure, the doctors at AIIMS explained in the study published in Drug Discoveries and Therapeutics. “Systemic corticosteroids before seven days from symptom onset are harmful and increase the risk of progression to hypoxia in symptomatic patients with mild Covid-19,” they added. The study involved follow-up of 140 Covid patients who were managed at AIIMS through teleconsultation. The researchers have concluded that steroids given for prolonged symptoms on or beyond seven days may decrease the risk of progression to hypoxia. The researchers have called for a well-designed randomised controlled trial to further study and address the issue. Since the pandemic began, thousands of people have died due to Covid-19 in the country. A total of 25,091 have succumbed to the disease in Delhi alone. Many who died suffered from sudden dip in oxygen saturation as the infection damaged the lungs. A study conducted by Max Healthcare showed that the mortality rate among the hospitalised patients in the second wave that peaked between April and May was about 40% higher than the first wave. During the second wave (January to mid-June 2021), the mortality ratio calculated for the 5,454 hospitalised patients worked out at 10.5%, which was about 40% higher than 7.2% mortality rate among the 14,398 patients hospitalised during the first wave (April-December 2020).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/low-o2-level-due-to-early-steroids-study-thinks-so/articleshow/87409351.cms||---

Union members have alleged that while under Section 68 of Motor Vehicles Act, the state government is empowered to revise fares of all commercial vehicles, authorities are reserving the right to fare revision only for autorickshaws. “Fares of all private cabs and privately operated buses are being decided by the respective operators. However, the government reserves the right to revise autorickshaw fares, which have remained unchanged for the past four years. With increase in CNG prices, operating at the same fare is no more viable,” said Rajveer Upadhyay, president, JADU. Upadhyay said that a petition has been filed in the Gujarat high court long ago regarding this.The association members have sought that autorickshaw drivers be empowered to revise fares which would be more viable. On Wednesday, JADU members held a meeting with the RTO regarding fare revision, a decision on which is expected next week. Rickshaw drivers have sought to revise minimum fare from existing Rs 15 per 1.25km to Rs 20, and per km charges to Rs 15-16 instead of prevailing Rs 10. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/auto-drivers-seek-fare-revision-rights/articleshow/87377432.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sanitiser bottles to replace roses at Diwali Pahat concerts||Mumbai: Through the seven years that music lovers have arrived for the early morning Diwali Pahat concert at Rangsharda Auditorium in Bandra, they have been greeted with a rose. This time they will be gifted a bottle of hand sanitiser. The hosts will distribute sealed packets of ‘faral’ or Diwali snacks rather than placing plates on open tables, to minimise contact. This uniquely Maharashtrian musical event is held after daybreak on Diwali day. Initially, it revolved around morning classical ragas, says show host Sandeep Kokil, but now encompasses bhavgeet and film songs as well. The Covid pandemic has wrought a new awakening in the way Diwali Pahat is organised. There will be gaps in seating, musical instruments and equipment will be rubbed with sanitiser, artistes are fully vaccinated, and guests must enter with masks firmly in place. Despite the rigours, listeners are simply thankful that Diwali Pahat has resumed after last year’s lockdown. Renowned artistes like Ustad Rashid Khan, Kaushiki Chakraborty, Pt Jayateerth Mevundi and Ashok Hande, alongside younger singers such as Shrikant Narayan and Prajakta Satardekar, will perform across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane from November 2-5. Performers, organisers and audiences alike are pleased because the resumption of Diwali Pahat comes right after the state government reopened auditoria and cinema halls from October 22. Anchor Sandeep Kokil of ‘Preet Rang’ at Vile Parle shared the sense of relief. “For over a year, people have been burdened by news of illness and vaccination availability. Finally they can relax with some music on a big festival,” he said. Vocalist Rashid Khan, who will perform at Shanmukhananda Hall on November 4, said, “This will be my second live show after the 18-month hiatus, and being back couldn’t have felt better. Even though virtual performances have taken off, nothing beats live performances. The live interaction with the audience is what makes a performance worthwhile.” Khan’s organiser Priti Mandke of Swarasparsh said, “It was a miracle that we were able to assemble this Diwali Pahat within days of the reopening of theatres. Since ours is a traditional classical concert, we hope to fill 1,250 seats, that is almost 50% of the 2,700 capacity of Shanmukhananda.” The Rangsharda event is the brainchild of BJP MLA Ashish Shelar. He said, “Our artistes and technicians will intersperse the songs by narrating the hardships they underwent during the lockdown. They will entertain as well as educate.” However, there is anxiety on various counts. Organiser Manoj Pathak, whose Preet Rang event is at Vishnudas Bhave hall in Vashi, said, “How is it possible to check if 500 visitors are fully vaccinated? I am anxious about filling even the permitted 50% seats due to conditions like full vaccination. The mask mandate is easier to follow.” Artiste-director Ashok Hande, with one Diwali Pahat each in Vile Parle and Borivli, said, “My grand production Marathi Bana has 125 performers and save three, all are fully vaccinated. We have had to purchase 122 new saris since the earlier costumes were spoilt during the 18-month shutdown. Equipment and instruments became rusty and dysfunctional. I wish the state had permitted theatres to operate at 100% capacity given the costs we incur. I spoke to state minister Ajit Pawar who assured me that he will consider the matter soon after Diwali.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sanitiser-bottles-to-replace-roses-at-diwali-pahat-concerts/articleshow/87378780.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Delhi||Hospitals may use 1/3rd Covid beds for dengue: Govt||New Delhi: Delhi government has said, if the need arises, hospitals may use one-third of the beds reserved for the coronavirus patients for those suffering from vector-borne diseases. The order came in the wake of a surge in dengue cases in the capital. Delhi has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue this year, with over 280 logged just last week, according to a civic report released on Monday. Of the total dengue cases this season, 665 were recorded in the first 23 days of this month alone. The city recorded its first death due to the vector-borne disease this season on October 18. “It is observed that the number of cases of dengue/malaria/chikungunya is on a rise, with increasing demand of beds for these patients. Further, many of the beds reserved for Covid patients are lying vacant due to the decline in number of cases,” the order issued on Friday read. The health department directed the medical directors and medical superintendents of Delhi government-run hospitals to use one third of the beds reserved for treating Covid patients, including ICU beds, for people suffering from dengue, malaria and chikungunya, if required. Of the 10,594 beds for Covid-19 patients in hospitals across Delhi, only 164 are occupied. As many as 10 people have died due to dengue at Safdarjung Hospital this season, officials from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) confirmed. Of them, the officials added, one woman was a Delhi resident, while the rest were from other states. Because the civic body considers deaths involving people living in Delhi only, the officials said, the toll due to dengue in the city stands at two now. This includes the woman who died at Safdarjung and another death at a private hospital. Both the deaths took place in September. The officials said they were investigating the reason of death and other details before confirming it. Some other hospitals have also reported SDMC about dengue deaths and the details shared by them were being examined. If these deaths are confirmed to be caused by dengue, the toll could increase further, the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hospitals-may-use-1/3rd-covid-beds-for-dengue-govt/articleshow/87409379.cms||---

If I write anything then I would become an enemy for them. In Congress, there is internal democracy and everyone can express their opinion,” he said. Later, he said the chief minister is under the control of a caucus led by additional private secretary C M Raveendran in his office. “Raveendran is the super CM in the office and no one will be able to approach the chief minister without his consent. Many top bureaucrats and ministers have complained against him to me. The chief minister is totally clueless on what is happening in his office,” said Philip. He said the cabinet ministers and party leaders fear the chief minister and hence they do not approach him directly or tell him anything straight. Hence the chief minister is being misled by this caucus, he said. Philip said he had to leave Congress since the then party leaders were not ready to listen to his demands. However, now Congress has learnt from its mistakes and took the decision to introduce new faces both in the organisation and also in the parliamentary party. Earlier, Philip met senior party leader A K Antony at his house. “Though we had strife initially, our discord condensed very soon. Now with this meet up, we were able to resolve the issues,” said Antony. CPM clarifies Philip had come alone to CPM and is now going back to Congress alone, he was not a party member and has not held any position in the party, said CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. On Philip’s allegations against the CM’s office, Vijayaraghavan said, “The people of Kerala know who the chief minister is and how his office is functioning. Transparency has been ensured there.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cherian-philip-back-in-congress-after-20-years/articleshow/87377486.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: In Covid era, suicides made a killing||AHMEDABAD: It was the year that brought the world to a standstill due to Covid-19 pandemic, but interpersonal issues, unresolved grief and financial crunch kept people on their toes. The trend was reflected in the suicide-related data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in its publication ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 2020.’ According to the report, Gujarat recorded a spike in suicide cases where love affair, poverty, unemployment and bankruptcy were cited as possible reasons. The state recorded 8,000-plus suicide cases, the highest in at least past one decade. It was a rise of about 5% compared to 2019. Analysis of the cases reveal that suicide cases related to professional problems rose by 72.5% in a year from 120 to 207. Moreover, suicides due to poverty (171) and bankruptcy (124) rose by 61% and 53% in a year respectively. Suicides due to love affair rose by 24.4% to 616 – one of the highest in the past few years. In terms of overall suicide cases, family problems and illnesses accounted for nearly half (48%) the cases. However, compared to one-third (33.6%) of suicides in India related to family issues, the percentage was 27%. The suicides due to love affair accounted for 4.4% in India, which was nearly double at 8% in Gujarat. Professional (job-related) issues also had double the percentage than India at 2.5% compared to 1.2% across the country. Of total suicides in state, unemployment claimed 3% of lives, which was 2.3% in India. The city and state-based suicide prevention and psychological services centres confirm to the trend. Pravin Valera, coordinator for Gandhinagar Police-run Jeevan Aastha (18002333330) suicide prevention helpline, said that the pandemic affected not only physical but also mental health of the citizens. “A large call volume in 2020 was from persons worried about the health of their near and dear ones, about their job loss and worries about financial status,” said Valera. Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent of Hospital for Mental Health, said that the number of OPDs with patients with depression has definitely increased during the pandemic. “Identifying what ails us and seeking help must be normalized,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/in-covid-era-suicides-made-a-killing/articleshow/87377475.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Man threatens to make private chats viral, woman ends life||AHMEDABAD: A 23-year-old woman from Gandhinagar committed suicide on Monday by hanging herself in her home allegedly because she was being constantly threatened by her former boyfriend with making the sex chat between them viral in friends’ groups, stated an FIR filed by Mansa police on Thursday. Her father came to know about the reason behind the extreme step when he saw a note while going through her belongings on Tuesday. The victim had noted her ordeal in a diary. In her FIR with the Mansa police, the victim’s father said that his daughter had completed her graduation last year from a college in Gandhinagar. On Monday evening, when he was at a hospital for treatment of her niece, he got a call from his son who informed him about the his daughter’s death. He rushed to his house and found his daughter lying dead and their neighbours gathered around her body. Fearing a social taboo, he along with some other relatives cremated the deceased on that night only and did not inform the police to hide the case. The next day, he began going through her belongings, including her bag, diaries and the cellphone, when he found the note. He said that she had written in her diary that a man from Nardipur village of Gandhinagar named Rushi Patel, used to threaten her that he would share their private chats in their friends groups. She said that she had broken off with that man but he still wanted her to have relationship with him. She had written in the diary that he was threatening to commit suicide and blame her for his death. This was hurting her too much so she decided to commit suicide, her father said in the complaint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/man-threatens-to-make-private-chats-viral-woman-ends-life/articleshow/87377485.cms||---

This majorly inconvenienced passengers in these districts for the second day in a row. The MSRTC management has warned employees to return to work or face stringent punishment, which could include dismissal from service. A notice was served to all staffers working at these 33 bus depots. A BJP union and few other unions had supported the second day of the strike, which was called for demanding a merger of MSRTC with the state government. On Friday, drivers, conductors did not ply buses and commuters were badly hit at these 33 depots, but the services at other depots resumed in the morning and over 9,000 buses were operated, sources said. Those protesting highlighted the plight of drivers and conductors who received ‘meagre salaries’. Yet another driver died by suicide in Ahmednagar district. The reason is yet to be known.

---||Ahmedabad||Can govt ban use of coal?: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday asked the state government to furnish details about the total consumption of coal in Gujarat every year. More significantly, the court wants the government to explore the possibility of supplying CNG, LPG, and PNG to industries so that air pollution can be curbed substantially. The HC was hearing a PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal who is seeking the prohibition of the use of coal as fuel in industries. Panchal wants gas to be used as fuel instead. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati sought the details about the consumption of coal in the state and the number of industries using only coal as fuel. The bench asked to what extent the possibility could be explored to supply gas to Gujarat industries so that they stopped using coal. While seeking these details, the high court cited the example of the Morbi ceramic cluster, where units were operated on coal-based gasifiers and the HC had ordered them to switch over to gas. “It has made a difference. A place which was a hell at one point of time is limping back to normalcy,” said Justice Pardiwala. “Coal otherwise also is a great problem, very dangerous.” The petitioner said that all coal-based industrial units should be ordered to use gas to bring down air pollution levels. He expressed dissatisfaction with the action plan drawn by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The government pleader, Manisha Lavkumar Shah, defended the policy but the judges interjected. “You (the government) may be taking steps and adopting devices to curb air pollution, but implementation is a big problem,” the court said. The court further said that by virtue of its order, Gujarat is now getting sufficient supply of CNG. The court asked the government to give details about the gas supply in Gujarat. The court also questioned why the state government cannot come out with a policy which does away with the use of coal, for nobody is disputing that coal is a big problem. The court said if the state government prohibits the use of coal as fuel for industries, many of its problems related to air pollution would be solved. “If you are able to do this (prohibit the use of coal), it will be miraculous and will go a long way. Let’s work it out,” the court said. The state government agreed to the proposal, but said that it cannot do it straightaway because gas supply is not available for industries in many parts of the state. The government said the industrialists will also take into consideration the cost factor. The court said that it will pass an interim order in this regard after the vacation and expressed its intention to involve other government departments in the litigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-can-govt-ban-use-of-coal/articleshow/87377532.cms||---

Even accidents while crossing railway lines also saw a decline. Experts say that due to the lockdown for most of the year, roads were empty and the few fatal accidents happened mostly due to overspeeding. As per the data, 5,601 accidents were reported in 2019 in comparison with 4,187 in 2020, showing a decline of 25.2%. Overspeeding continued to remain on the number 1 spot behind the causes for these accidents, with 1,563 cases. In these, 1,168 people sustained injuries, while 523 died. Dangerous driving and rash overtaking stood at number 2, with 1,805 accidents reported, and 1,599 were injured and 450 were killed. Other factors were driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and lack of road infrastructure. A senior traffic official said that even though the number of vehicles plying on the road was fewer during the lockdown, there was an increase in the number of speeding challans. “The camera system caught most of the speeding cases and challans were mailed to the drivers’ homes,” said the official. “People complained of multiple fines but there were many violations that caused accidents. The lockdown was the main reason the number of fatal accidents saw a decline.” The official added that drunken driving fines stopped during the lockdown and began in September this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/road-fatalities-down-by-20-largely-due-to-lockdowns/articleshow/87378787.cms||---

According to customs, the plants were farmed in 47 plant-beds, and seemed to have been planted around two months ago. The plantation was found at Vanapullunjali and in the lower reaches of Pishachumala in Gottiyarkandi area of Attappadi reserve forest, Attappadi range in Mannarkkad forest division. The two-day long operation was held on Tuesday and Wednesday. Customs sleuths said that the plants were destroyed by setting them on fire. Customs sources said that the operation was held after receiving a tip-off about ganja being farmed in around five acres in Attappadi forest. A team of five officials from customs unit along with 25 forest officials conducted the mission in two teams. A senior customs official said that they had to trek for nearly 24 hours to reach the spot. The customs team included customs superintendents Sidheswaran S, Shaji Kuriakose; inspectors Vineedh Antony and Basil Philip and Raviprasad PV. The forest team was led by range forest officer Subair N and section forest officers P Subin and Suresh Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/ganja-plantation-in-attapadi-forest-destroyed/articleshow/87377541.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Manhole-cleaning robot vanishes in Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation rabbit hole||AHMEDABAD: In November last year, Gandhinagar became, on paper at least, the second city in the state after Surat to use a robot for cleaning manholes. However, a year on, neither the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) nor the urban development department has any record of robot use for cleaning manholes. In November 2020, Nitin Patel — the deputy chief minister at the time — had operated the robot and had placed it in the service of the GMC. Patel had said that the robot can clean manholes up to 8.5m. Recently an Ahmedabad-based RTI activist, Yash Makwana, filed an RTI application with the urban development department and sought details about the usage and the maintenance of the robot. He also wanted to know how many manholes had been cleaned by the robot. In its letter to Makwana, the urban development department stated that the application had been forwarded to the GMC as it was in the jurisdiction of the corporation. But the GMC sent the application to the sanitation department, contending that all the queries were within the remit of that department. The sanitation department of the GMC in turn said that it does not have any information regarding the usage of the robot. A GMC official said: “The robot had been gifted by Sabarmati Gas Company to the capital project department of the state government which oversees works in Gandhinagar.” The official added: “Hence it was technically not within the jurisdiction of the GMC. Therefore, we do not have any information.” “I had got information that sanitation workers had no choice but to enter manholes to clean them,” said Makwana. “A group of us had given a memorandum to the collector, but no solution was found.” He went on to say: “So I filed an RTI application. The corporation has said that it does not have any record.” Makwana said that if the robot was in the jurisdiction of the capital project department, the application should have been transferred to that department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/manhole-cleaning-robot-vanishes-in-gmc-rabbit-hole/articleshow/87377534.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Poet and political anthropologist Ather Zia was scheduled to speak at the webinar and build upon the ethnography of her book, “Resisting Disappearance.” The event description, which read that Zia would give an overview of the “historical gendered resistance to Indian occupation in Kashmir,” led to a social media uproar. The description added, “It will discuss the fresh challenges to resistance and dissent in Kashmir post-2019 and how it has affected women and Kashmiris in general.” The Centre for Women’s Studies, in a social media post, said that the event had been cancelled, without giving any further explanation. JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar in a statement said that the faculty member did not seek the permission of administration before planning the event. Kumar added, “The notice of the webinar says, ‘This talk will draw and build upon the ethnography of… gendered resistance to Indian occupation in Kashmir’. This is a highly objectionable and a provocative subject, which questions the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. JNU cannot be a platform to this kind of very questionable webinars.

---||Mumbai||Just before retirement, BMC official aided blacklisted contractors?||MUMBAI: BJP on Friday alleged that BMC reduced the blacklisting period from seven years to three years of half a dozen road contractors who were indicted in the 2016 roads scam. It alleged that kickbacks of around Rs 100 crore were given for reduction in period so that tainted contractors could participate in new tenders for road work worth Rs 2,200 crore. TimesViewThe 2016 road scam was one of the biggest scams in BMC for which contractors and civic officials were jailed. Then civic chief Ajoy Mehta was scathing in his observations about the scandal and stated that all six contractors and third-party auditors failed in duties and were involved in perpetuating irregularities. Given the scam’s severity, BMC’s move to reduce the period of blacklisting for contractors is alarming and hints at corruption. BMC must bar these contractors from bidding in new road work tenders.“The road contractors were found guilty in the Rs 975-crore road scam. They had been blacklisted for seven years. For seven years, they could not bid for tenders in BMC. The blacklisting period for two was reduced to three years in 2019, and the other contractors were given clean chits,” said BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha. Kotecha shared an order dated October 22 signed by director (engineering & projects) Babasaheb Salve. Kotecha said Salve signed the order 10 days before retirement this month. The order states the blacklisting period as three years, starting March 23, 2017. “This was done at the behest of a cabinet minister and a cousin. BMC has given a clean chit to the contractors and reduced the blacklisting period to three years so that they can bid for current road tenders. The blacklisting for three years started in March 2017 and ended in March 2020, so the order issued in October 2021 clearly shows a massive kickback trail,” Kotecha said. Following the scam, six contractors were blacklisted for seven years. It came to light in 2016, when then mayor Snehal Ambekar alleged malpractices in road repair work in a confidential letter to then municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta. While a probe was conducted by deputy municipal commissioner Vasant Prabhu and S O Kori, chief engineer (bridges), it was led by then additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Deshmukh. An SIT was formed to probe the scam. Top road work officials were booked for cheating and forgery, and were arrested. Senior civic officials, Ashok Pawar (chief engineer, building & maintenance) and Uday Murudkar (chief engineer, vigilance), were suspended and later arrested for complicity. “The orders are issued in quasi-judicial capacity. Apparently, the companies have been blacklisted for almost six years now. No Act or norm provides for six or seven years of blacklisting. There are strong HC and SC case precedents. The centre’s procurement manual does not provide for more than two years of blacklisting. Orders by the director are logical and proper,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/just-before-retirement-official-aided-blacklisted-contractors/articleshow/87378886.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

As per the plea, Sajeevan went missing on September 29, a day before he was to attend a meeting of CPM’s Poothope branch. A man-missing complaint was filed before Ambalappuzha police in the evening itself, but no effective probe was conducted. The wife, in the plea, has said that the disappearance of her husband is believed to be linked to the in-fighting in the Thottappally unit of CPM. Her husband, who was part of the rebel group, was supposed to attend the Poothope branch meeting. With Sajeevan going missing, the branch meeting has been postponed indefinitely. Even a complaint filed before Alappuzha SP on October 6 has not yielded any results, the habeas corpus plea said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/abducted-cpm-workers-wife-moves-hc/articleshow/87377611.cms||---
---||Delhi||30-feet Ram Mandir replica in Delhi for Diwali puja||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other cabinet ministers will perform Diwali puja on November 4 on a stage that would hold a 30-feet-high replica of the Ram Mandir being built in Ayodhya, according to government sources. Work is on at Thyagraj Stadium Complex in south Delhi to create the replica of the Ram Mandir, apparently as directed by the office of deputy CM Manish Sisodia, though the latter neither confirmed nor denied to TOI that the replica was being put up. Kejriwal, who visited Ram Janmabhoomi and the Hanumangarhi temples in Ayodhya on Tuesday, recently announced that the Delhi Cabinet will conduct Diwali puja at 7pm on behalf of the two crore Delhiites and telecast the programme live for everyone to join in. “I urge you all to participate with us virtually by also celebrating Diwali with the TV on. Imagine the positive vibrations the joint celebrations will create,” Kejriwal said at an event in Delhi last week. Kejriwal’s visit to Ayodhya came ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, in which the Aam Aadmi Party has said that it will contest from all the 403 seats. The replica of the Ram Mandir will reportedly be a part of the stage for the Diwali puja on November 4. The replica will be built on a metal frame, with the exterior of the temple to be built of plywood and thermocol. The work is expected to be completed by the end of this week and three days before Diwali. On Wednesday, the Delhi Cabinet approved the addition of Ayodhya to the pilgrimages under the Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana. The CM announced after the cabinet meeting that “the elderly of Delhi who have a desire to visit Shri Ram Lalla in Ayodhya will have their trip facilitated by Delhi Government for free”. The CM said that under the Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana, the entire expense of the elderly, from the time they left home to their return, including travel by AC trains, stay at AC hotels, meals, local travel, etc., will be borne by Delhi Government. The elderly can also take someone younger as an attendant. That person’s expenses would be covered as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/30-ft-ram-mandir-replica-for-diwali-puja/articleshow/87378816.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘States have no willpower to deal with stubble burning’||Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai tells Priyangi Agarwal that Centre has to be more determined and active in drawing up a policy on stubble burning and implementing it. With winter setting in, Delhi’s air quality has started deteriorating. How prepared are we to control air pollution this year? We are more prepared this time. We have been conducting different activities in Delhi for the past one month. The sources of pollution in Delhi are stubble burning (major component of pollution), dust, vehicles, biomass burning and others. We have been running an anti-dust campaign to control dust pollution for nearly a month and our teams have inspected over 2,000 sites and imposed a penalty of over Rs 1 crore. For stubble burning within Delhi, we are spraying the bio-decomposer solution in the fields for free. We are also running a ‘Red light on, Gaddi off’ campaign to control vehicular pollution. Do you think scrapping of the SC-appointed EPCA panel has affected the momentum of action being taken against polluters and holding them down to commitments? In Delhi, the government is taking suo moto action. We are working at three different levels. Firstly, we are making policies for permanent solutions. We brought an e-vehicle policy, tree transplantation policy and tree plantation scheme, which will have long-term impact. We have converted over 1,500 industries running on polluted fuel to PNG. Secondly, we are making efforts to take technological support. We installed a smog tower as a pilot project and we are analyzing its impact. We have signed an MoU with IIT-Kanpur on conducting a real-time source apportionment study. Thirdly, we are taking all immediate actions as required. Whichever committee is formed, I feel we can have impactful results when states take responsibility and work jointly. Do you feel the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR is doing enough interventions to ensure that Delhi does not choke this year? The commission is working positively on some issues. However, I believe the Centre has to take the initiative and create a system to ensure implementation of policies. The Centre should draw up an action plan and monitor it. Whatever committee you make, it can be controlled only when the government at the Centre and surrounding states show a strong determination. What should the Centre do? The Centre gives funds to all states to control stubble burning. An action plan should be prepared based on where and how much money was spent. The states are utilising the funds but the impact is not visible on the ground. The Centre gives some subsidy while the farmers have to invest the rest from their own pockets. Hence, they are hesitant. However, I believe that money should be allotted for free spraying of the bio-decomposer and a centralised solution should be prepared. The responsibility of block level officers should be fixed. The budget for the bio-decomposer will be less than what’s currently being spent on controlling stubble burning. The Centre will have to make some changes at the policy level. Stubble is burnt on a large scale and what’s being done on the ground doesn’t match that scale. The Centre should set up some mechanism for enforcing it. The neighbouring states lack the willpower to deal with stubble burning. Has the agitation by farmers put the government on the defensive because they will no longer be penalized for burning stubble? Punishment is not a permanent solution. I want to repeat that stubble is not a problem of the farmers but a result of the government’s inactivity. Dust from big construction sites is a major contributor to air pollution. Have you seen any improvement in compliance after some major companies were penalized? We are running an anti-dust campaign and around 70% of the construction sites are complying. I have conducted meetings with construction agencies and carried out inspections. A message has to be sent that if you do wrong, you won’t be spared and action will be taken against both government and private agencies. The campaign has made an impact. The Delhi government is running a ‘Red light on, Gaddi off’ campaign this year. Does the government have other plans to control vehicular pollution in the city? We are running a campaign to check PUC certificates. We are also creating awareness among RWAs to reduce at least one trip per week from their routine schedule. The odd-even scheme will be our last resort. If the situation arises and experts give their opinion, the government will take a decision. Despite a ban being in place, crackers were set off last year, causing worsening of air quality. As crackers are available in the neighbouring areas and there are reports of traders stocking up in Delhi, how does the government plan to implement the ban this time? Last year, firecrackers were banned a few days before Diwali. This time, we have not issued a licence to anyone for selling firecrackers and the ban was imposed right at the beginning. We are running a ‘Patake Nahi, Diye Jalao’ campaign and over 150 police teams and 33 SDM teams are working on this. We have alerted the police stations located on the border areas to keep an eye on this. However, some people are running a campaign that it’s a religious matter. I want to tell them with folded hands that crackers are not related to religion. When our ancestors started celebrating Diwali, there were no crackers. I want to appeal to people who are describing it as a religious issue that they should not spread rumours and we have to stop burning crackers to reduce pollution. The high pollution level around Diwali affects our children and elderly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/states-have-no-willpower-to-deal-with-stubble-burning/articleshow/87409498.cms||---

In a statement issued on Friday, the Tata Steel said the two companies have signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) of 25 years for setting up a 41MW solar project. The project will consist of a rooftop, floating and ground mounted solar panels. Once commissioned, the power project will produce 1,40,93,61,488 kWh power during its lifetime of 25 years and will cut down on CO2 emissions by 45,210 tonne annually, the steel major said. “In the recent past, projects on power generation from solar and non-conventional energy sources have gained momentum across our operating locations. We will continue with our pursuit of clean energy solutions and expand our renewable energy footprint,” T V Narendra, the CEO and managing director of Tata Steel, said. Tata Power will develop photo-voltaic capacities for Tata Steel’s plants in Jamshedpur (21.97 MWp) and Odisha’s Kalinganagar (19.22 MWp). In March this year, the two companies had announced plans to develop a 15MW solar project for Jamshedpur. In 2017, Tata Power Solar commissioned a 3MW solar PV power plant in Tata Steel’s iron-ore mine at Noamundi in West Singhbhum district. It was the first solar power plant of its kind in any iron ore mine in the country. “This blended solar PV project is yet another milestone in our shared vision of a better tomorrow. We look forward to working closely with them (Tata Steel) to cover all their other plants across the country,” Praveer Sinha, the CEO and MD of Tata Power, said. Tata Power will develop rooftop PV cells of 7.5 MWp, floating PVs of 10.8 MWp and ground mounted PVs of 3.6 MWp for the project. The ground mounted PV will be installed at Sonari airport.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/tata-steel-and-tata-power-to-jointly-set-up-41-mw-grid-connected-solar-projects-in-jharkhand-odisha/articleshow/87377503.cms||---
---||Ranchi||JMM expels 12, all from Chatra unit, as family feud comes to fore||RANCHI: If the recent political developments are any indication, things are not well within Jharkhand’s most powerful political family —The Sorens — which boasts of a chief minister (Hemant), one member of the Upper House (Shibu), two MLAs (Basant and Sita) and a state (Odisha) party president (Anjali). The chasm in the family feud is being witnessed in the party organization after a dozen party leaders, including two central committee members, were axed from the primary membership for a period of six years. Of the 12 expelled members, 10 are from the Chatra district unit. The other two sacked central committee members also hail from Chatra. The development indicates that the rift is between Sita, the wife of deceased Durga Soren and eldest daughter-in-law of Shibu, and the rest of the family. On Thursday, JMM general secretary cum spokesperson Vinod Pandey expelled 12 members of the party, including the central committee members — Santosh Nayak and Manoranjan Rana — on charges of anti-party activities after a nod from Shibu. The action was taken on the recommendation of Chatra district party president Pankaj Kumar Prajapati. The expulsions assumed significance in the wake of the fact that Shibu’s eldest daughter-in-law — Sita — has been demanding the removal of Prajapati from the post of the district president for long. She has been expressing discontent against the party on several occasions and the demand for action against Prajapati is one of the prominent fights that she has been picking up for over a year now. The genesis of the fight was an incident in August 2020 when Sita, the MLA from Jama, had visited Chatra to support the agitation of the displaced people in Tandwa. At that time, Prajapati had allegedly stopped the party workers from attending the dharna where Sita was present. The MLA had then accused Prajapati of doing so at the behest of the party general secretary, Vinod Pandey. Since Sita is also enjoying the support of some of the JMM leaders in Chatra, she had been successful in orchestrating a “split within the district party unit”. On September 23 this year, a group of JMM workers comprising the two central committee members — Nayak and Rana — along with seven district members — Kailash Singh, Dinesh Pandey, Jagdish Yadav, Ravindra Singh, Dhaneshwar Ganjhu, Sangita Pathak and Pankaj Mishra — allegedly insulted the minister-in-charge of Chatra, Hafizul Hassan, during his visit there. Three other district party members — Rajkishore Kamal, Prakash Ram Paswan and Rajesh Kushwaha — who were believed to have been expelled earlier but confirmed on Thursday, also allegedly took part in the agitation against Hassan. JMM sources said a group of leaders at the behest of Sita claimed to be leading the party in the district and not the one led by Prajapati. It was during Hassan’s visit that the group tried making a point by raising slogans against him for not acknowledging them. Peeved over the development, the central committee sought a report from Prajapati and based on his report, the committee expelled the 12 members from the party. Interestingly, Sita had floated a socio-political outfit named Durga Soren Sena and introduced two of her daughters — Jayashri and Rajashri — to the political arena earlier this month in Ranchi. On October 19, the first district office of the outfit was inaugurated in Ramgarh. Reacting to the expulsions, Sita expressed her angst out in the open. Tweeting two letters issued by the JMM central committee, which included Thursday’s expulsion of 12 members and another of October 24 in which the party expelled JMM Dhanbad unit member Madan Ram, Sita said Jharkhand is crying for help to be freed from the dishonest and the touts. She tweeted, “The Durga Soren Sena has been formed just to save Jharkhand from them.” Tagging father-in-law, the MLA further wrote that the party is in the hands of dishonest people who are playing dirty politics for the fragmentation of the party. Sita, however, expressed confidence that “Guruji” would take appropriate action to ensure that the party regains its status just the way that was shaped by him and his son Durga.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jmm-expels-12-all-from-chatra-unit-as-family-feud-comes-to-fore/articleshow/87377523.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||CM Hemant Soren urges government to increase purchasing power of villagers||RANCHI: Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday called on the states to work on increasing the purchasing power of their respective tribal communities living in the villages. Soren flew down to Raipur to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Tribal Dance Festival and Rajyotsava 2021. The event, patronised by Chhattisgarh’s Congress-led government, got underway at Raipur’s Science College Ground. “Tribal societies live amidst nature. Their farms, livestock and forest produce are wealth to them. The Chhattisgarh government’s efforts to help the tribal communities by providing minimum support price (MSP) in forest produce are commendable. The country and its states can only develop if their villages prosper. Efforts should be made to increase the purchasing power of the rural people and the upliftment of the country’s underprivileged, backward and economically weaker sections,” Soren said in his address as the chief guest of the event. Hemant’s prominence in the country’s political theatre has grown since his party teamed up with the Congress and the RJD to rout the BJP in Jharkhand in the 2019 state assembly polls. Hemant has also been involved in preparing the contours of an all opposition grouping to take on the BJP in the 2024 Parliamentary polls. As many as 1,000 tribal artists from countries such as Uganda, Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Philippines and 27 states and six union territories will participate in the ongoing festival in Raipur. A contingent of tribal artists from Jharkhand is also attending the event. Soren attempted to strike a chord with the tribal communities by leveraging his office. ““This is not just a dance festival, but an honour to those who have been educationally, socially and economically deprived. This is a message to the whole country that if we want, this class can walk with us. Departments are created in their name, but the community is deprived of its rights and facilities. I come from a tribal community and reaching here (the post of CM) was a big challenge. I wish all the best to all the artists who have come here.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hemant-urges-govts-to-increase-purchasing-power-of-villagers/articleshow/87377456.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||Chargesheet reads like a novel, says HC while slamming CBI again||Chandrajit MukerjeeRANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court pulled up the CBI yet another time here on Friday for its chargesheet in the Dhanbad judge murder case. The high court observed that the chargesheet is rather a “novel” and does not bring home the charge of Section 302 (punishment for murder in the Indian Penal Code). A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad were hearing the petition monitoring the investigation in the murder case of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand. The CBI after concluding the investigation has filed its charge sheet indicating “murder” of the judge who was out for his morning walk on July 28 in Dhanbad. The bench observed that nothing conclusive has been done in the investigation and no new facts have come up. The agency has filed the chargesheet in a routine manner while keeping the high court in the dark, the judges observed. The investigation is not foolproof and seems like a novel, the court said. The case will again be heard on November 12. The high court in the last date of the proceedings had hauled up the independent agency for having filed a flimsy a chargesheet. “The chargesheet lacks conclusive evidence and is sketchy,” the court had earlier observed. “If this is how the agency will work, then what message will be conveyed across the country. This is a sensational case, a judicial officer has been slained,” the judges observed. It is not the first time that the high court has expressed its annoyance and anguish on the way the investigation has been conducted by the CBI. The CBI has been heckled by the court on several occasions earlier for not being able to conclude the investigation convincingly. Judge Uttam Anand, an additional district judge ranking officer posted in Dhanbad was bumped off by an auto rickshaw on July 28. Anand had gone out early in the morning for a walk when he was knocked by the vehicle near the Randhir Verma Chowk in the coal city. The incident was captured in the CCTV cameras and got viral in the social media.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/chargesheet-reads-like-a-novel-says-hc-while-slamming-cbi-again/articleshow/87377553.cms||---

So, 24-year-old Gandu Shiva, from Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, still traumatised by the incident, decided to do something about it. The youth, a native of Timmayapaelm in Addanki mandal of Prakasam district in Guntur of AP, has embarked on a padayatra from Kanyakumari to Jammu and Kashmir with an aim to build a blood bank in his native village and raise awareness about blood donation in the country. On Thursday, Shiva reached Ranchi, Jharkhand’s capital, walking around 7,000 km since he embarked on a life-saving mission in April this year. “I began the journey from Kanyakumari on April 1 and traversed through 14 states so far covering 7,000km. From Ranchi, I will head to Patna on Friday morning,” Shiva told TOI during his halt at a city hotel on Thursday. “Last year during the first wave of Covid-induced lockdown, we had to rush my elder sister who was pregnant to hospital after she developed some complications. She required blood but we couldn’t arrange it on time as people weren’t ready to donate due to fear of Covid-19 and my village didn’t have any government blood bank. In fact, in my mandal, there are 28 villages and no blood bank for such a vast population. The nearest blood bank from my village was about 200km which is a private one. Even if some banks agreed to give blood, they quoted hefty amounts, and we didn’t have enough money. Ultimately, my sister lost her child.” “My only demands are that blood must be available across the country to everyone at Re 1, blood banks must be present at every nook and corner of the country, but most importantly, people must come forward to donate blood. Reports say over 10 lakh people require blood daily but only 2 lakh get access to it easily. Since blood can’t be manufactured in the lab, only donations can help scores of people suffering from cancer, thalassemia among others,” he said. Shiva will conclude his journey in Delhi via Jammu and Kashmir, which he said is likely to take another 2-3 months. In Ranchi, volunteers of Liver Saver’s, an outfit working in this field, has arranged for his stay for a day and food.. Jharkhand police’s ADG Sanjay Anand Lathkar, too, has extended his support to Shiva assuring him of all kind of help during his journey after felicitating him at his office.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/andhra-youth-reaches-state-capital-walking-7000km-to-raise-awareness-on-blood-donation/articleshow/87377689.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Earlier in the day, Maharashtra defeated Chandigarh 6-2 to bag the third spot. In the finals, Jharkhand took the lead early after Deepika Soren successfully converted a penalty corner in the fifth minute. Haryana, however, came back from behind and not only equalised in the first quarter but scored two more goals. Jharkhand’s Roshni Kumar converted another penalty corner in the 39th minute and narrowed the gap to one goal. However, the prospects of an equalizer were marred by several missed opportunities within the striking circle. “We missed half-a-dozen penalty opportunities which we should have converted and that cost us the game,” Jharkhand coach Pratima Barwa said after the match. Sounding disappointed, former captain of the Indian women’s hockey team, Asunta Lakra, who witnessed the match, said, “Our girls could not convert several opportunities. In contrast, the Haryana players cashed in on most of the chances and scored.” For Haryana, Neelam converted two penalty corners while Seema netted a field goal in the 21st minute to seal Jharkhand’s fate and win the title. Haryana finished with 50 goals in the tournament.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jkhand-hockey-girls-go-down-fighting-against-hry-maha-bags-3rd-spot-in-natl-jr-cship/articleshow/87377679.cms||K A Gupta
---||Ranchi||Kin hold demonstrations in districts to support protesting assistant police personnel||Ranchi: Parents and family members of assistant police personnel, who are sitting on an indefinite dharna at the Morhabadi ground here, staged dharna and rallies at their respective home districts on Thursday. The personnel are on a dharna in the capital for more than a month now demanding regularisation of their services. One of the protesters, Amit Kumar Mishra, said, “Our guardians took out rallies in our respective districts and staged protests in front of the deputy commissioner’s office. The rallies were held in 12 extremist-affected districts where we have been appointed for aiding the police force.” During the protests, the relatives raised slogans saying that the demands of the assistant police personnel were reasonable and that justice should be done to them. The personnel are on indefinite dharna since September 27 and on Thursday, they staged a protest from 11 am to 3 pm in support of the demonstrations held by their parents. Another protester, Vivekanand Gupta, said, “Even though one month has passed, no one from the government has approached us for talks. We should not be the victim of political rivalries.” The earlier BJP government had appointed around 2,500 assistant police personnel in extremist-affected Giridih, Chatra, Dumka, West Singhbhum, East Singhbhum, Gumla, Simdega, Latehar, Khunti, Palamu, Lohardaga and Garwah districts in 2017 on a contractual basis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/kin-hold-demonstrations-in-districts-to-support-protesting-assistant-police-personnel/articleshow/87377582.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||State opens Chhath ghats, lifts Sunday ban on shops||Ranchi: The Jharkhand government on Friday allowed Chhath devotees to perform their rituals in the lakes, rivers, ponds and other waterbodies. However, it has not allowed Kali Puja pandals in Ranchi or in any other part of the state to open for devotees apprehending a probable mass transmission of Covid-19 virus. Chhath festival is on November 10 while Kali Puja will be observed on November 4. Last year, the government had banned the entry of devotees at Chhath ghats but was forced to reverse its decision after a public outcry and pressure from the BJP-led opposition. The state disaster management authority (SDMA) met under the chairmanship of chief minister Hemant Soren at the state secretariat on Friday afternoon. After deliberations, it lifted the Sunday ban on opening of commercial establishments. “The SDMA also lifted the cap on business hours on commercial establishments, which was fixed until now at 8 pm between Mondays and Saturdays,” state disaster management minister Banna Gupta said after the meeting. The SDMA mandated that the guidelines which were in place during the Durga Puja will be effective for Kali Puja as well. It would mean that while devotees won’t be allowed inside the pandals, the idols will have to be under five feet and the pandals will be covered from three sides. Decorative lighting, gates and loudspeakers will remain banned. “Bhog will be delivered at the doorsteps by the respective Puja committees,” Gupta added. The SDMA also allowed marriage parties to be held with a maximum of 500 people and stadiums (indoors and outdoors) to open with 50% seating capacity. This would mean that the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) can allow spectators (50% of their seating capacity) into the stadium for the upcoming T20 international match between India and New Zealand on November 19. The SDMA also allowed the private coaching centres to hold offline classes for students of class 10 and above. Earlier, offline classes were allowed for students who were aged 18 years and above. It also allowed the Anganwadi centres and swimming pools to open on condition that Anganwadi sevikas and athletes would need to be fully vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-opens-chhath-ghats-lifts-sunday-ban-on-shops/articleshow/87377626.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Nagpur||Many schools ignore Diwali vacation orders||NAGPUR: Many schools in Nagpur ignored the state education department’s orders to start Diwali vacations from October 28 as it had come just a day before that, throwing their exam schedule into a tizzy. TOI had reported on Thursday how schools had decided to straightaway defy the order and keep the last working day on October 30. A CBSE school principal, who did not wish to be identified, said, “We went ahead with exams in online mode for kids up to Std VIII. Physical exams were held as per schedule for Std IX. Problem is that we just can’t push the stop button in less than 24 hours. The exam schedule is planned at least one month in advance, sometime even earlier if it had been a non-Covid year. Now because restrictions keep coming and going, we can’t plan too far ahead.” The reason that schools were even more unhappy was because the education department prohibited them from holding online classes too. A principal said, “What is their problem if we are holding online exams and classes? We want that exams for this term must be over before Diwali so that teachers get enough time for evaluation. Also, after Diwali, we will be busy with Std X and XII term-1 exams.” Even state board schools chose to defy the education department’s notification. A principal said, “On Wednesday afternoon, we received a letter that from Thursday vacations will start. In their earlier letter, it was to start from November 1. It’s unacceptable that those sitting in mantralaya can act as they please.” Education officials too seem to have looked the other way and not penalized any school for flouting the orders. Officially, the education department did not receive any complaints, so for them, everything was closed. Unofficially, they know that schools are not at fault. An education official said, “We were told that the government had to conduct some survey and that’s why these vacations got pre-poned by two-three days. Schools already had exams scheduled, not all but quite a few, so they went ahead with that. Majority of them, however, held these exams online.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/many-schools-ignore-diwali-vacation-orders/articleshow/87377918.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||CBSE teachers being overworked, says association||NAGPUR: CBSE teachers in Nagpur are being overworked and overburdened with offline/online combo sessions, claims an association representing them. The CBSE Staff Welfare Association (CSWA) said teachers are being forced to stay back at schools for hours even after finishing their work. Deepali Dably, founder president of CSWA, said, “Just today itself, a teacher fainted on campus because of the increased work pressure. She was then rushed to the hospital and is now better. There are multiple cases like these and teachers are afraid to come out and speak against the management.” The association has received many complaints about school management mentally harassing teachers. “One teacher said she has to report to school campus even for online classes. So, she has to go half an hour early and set up everything. Her classes finish by noon, but they make the teacher stay back till almost 4pm. When asked why, the reason given was that the management does not want teachers to go home early. And while at school, they are being given unnecessary work to keep them busy,” said Dably. The association has called for a press conference on Saturday, where this will be one of the issues discussed. Dably said, “95% of teachers in CBSE schools are women. All the health problems they are facing is because of the mental trauma they are being put through. Even if they show the slightest resistance to autocratic behaviour, teachers are threatened with salary cuts or even job loss.” Dably has been pushing for a CBSE teachers’ tribunal in either Nagpur or anywhere in the state so that teachers have an official platform to raise their concerns. While they have found sympathetic ears in the Union government and the CBSE even wrote to the state education department, nothing has materialized. All the communication so far by authorities and even ministers cannot be categorized as ‘orders’ to the state education department and, hence, implementation cannot be mandated. But Dably is not giving up. “I have been fighting for every CBSE teacher, everyone who does not have a voice. We want this exploitation to stop and will launch an agitation to push our demand,” said Dably.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cbse-teachers-being-overworked-says-association/articleshow/87377988.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||International Thrift Day: On a mission to spread financial literacy through rural schools||NAGPUR: Majority of the students in government schools in rural areas are children of labourers and workers. Given the poor financial background of these students, terms like banking, saving, financial planning etc are considered alien for them. But the reality can be completely different. According to Amruta Rajendra Deshpande, a trained certified management accountant (CMA), “Students from rural areas, who study in government schools, have better understanding of concepts related to money, banking and savings.” Amruta has been conducting financial literacy campaign for young students by visiting rural schools of Vidarbha. While the International Thrift Day will be celebrated on October 30, Amruta celebrates it almost daily. This day was established to educate people about the idea of saving money in a bank rather than keeping it under their mattress or at home. Amruta, who hails from Wani (Yavatmal district), has taken it as a mission to visit rural schools and inform children about banking, saving, and financial literacy. Author of two books on financial literacy, Amruta conducts these informative talks free of cost. Since the reopening of schools in rural areas, she has visited over 65 schools in rural Yavatmal and 20 in Chandrapur district. “Nowadays, students have bank accounts by default and get many government allowances credited there. Many students work in weekly markets and earn money regularly. Others assist their parents and get some pocket money. It’s the best time to learn the importance and benefit of saving,” she said. Amruta’s 45-minute talk includes basics of banking, introduction to RBI, types of accounts, identifying genuine currency notes etc. She smartly shares the benefits of small savings. She has been doing it since long, however, she launched it as a formal mission and named it ‘Vitta Prabodhini’ after schools reopened in August in rural areas. “I started it as a mission after I came to know about a girl student who had attended one of my earlier seminars in her school. The girl saved Rs5,000 in her account. During pandemic, when her mother was infected and admitted to hospital, this money was used to run the family,” said Amruta. She stresses that if children are made financially literate right from school level, it will help a lot in reducing poverty in the long-run. In the next phase of the mission, she plans to visit rural schools across Maharashtra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/international-thrift-day-on-a-mission-to-spread-financial-literacy-through-rural-schools/articleshow/87378019.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In absolute terms, non-performing assets (NPAs) of the bank, which had posted a net profit of Rs 920 crore in the first quarter this fiscal, soared 10-fold year-on-year to Rs 8763.6 crore in the second quarter from Rs 873.9 crore for the year-ago period. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, NPAs grew 36% from Rs 6440.3 crore in the first quarter. Bandhan Bank MD & CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh said, “It was a very critical quarter. But not just for us, everyone is undergoing the same. We recognized this reality and strengthen our balance sheet to be prepared for the future business. All stresses are assessed and finalised in this moment. And then, the bank made a one-time additional provision. This quarter total provisioning was Rs 5578 crore. Due to such provisioning, the bank has reported a loss of around Rs 3000 crore in this quarter...it is not a loss, it is like taking some brake comfortably so that from today we can only focus on business growth and quality of the portfolio.” Ghosh said the bank believed that this provisioning should be “sufficient” to take care of any previous asset quality issues on account of the ongoing pandemic as well as protect it against the disruptions caused by any potential third wave. During the second quarter this fiscal, the bank’s gross NPAs as a percentage of total loans increased 964 basis points on year-on-year basis to 10.8% from 1.18% during the same quarter last fiscal. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the gross NPA ratio soared 264 basis points.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bandhan-bank-q2-net-loss-at-rs-3kcr-on-provisions/articleshow/87378074.cms||---

Though the meetings were described as “courtesy calls”, they did give rise to speculation that the West Bengal outfit was trying to convince Goan lawmakers to join the TMC bandwagon. Madkai MGP MLA Ramakrishna Dhavalikar along with his brother Pandurang, MGP party chief, met Banerjee at the International Centre Goa (ICG). Provorim independent MLA Rohan Khaunte and lone NCP MLA from Benaulim Churchill Alemao also met the West Bengal CM, where they called for the unity of opposition forces. “Mamata Banerjee is a tall leader and she has come down to Goa. Prashant Kishor has been in touch with me and we had one or two meetings. This was a courtesy call to meet her and understand what is her vision for Goa, what her plans are for Goa,” said Khaunte after his meeting. With the elections just three months away, Khaunte said that all political parties need to be “on the same platform to see that the ruling government goes home”. Alemao, who took his daughter Valanka for his meeting with Banerjee, conveyed a similar sentiment to the TMC chief. Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, a former deputy CM, said that the question of an alliance with TMC does not arise as Banerjee has already categorically stated that her party will contest all 40 seats. “She has already declared that she will contest all 40 constituencies, so the question of an alliance does not arise. And we have also said that we will not join any other party,”said Dhavalikar. He said that if Congress leader Rahul Gandhi invited MGP for a meeting, he would go.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/local-netas-meet-didi-talk-of-anti-bjp-stance/articleshow/87378122.cms||---

However, the revenue from operations of the company registered a 19.5% jump to Rs 3,290 crore during the same period from Rs 2,753 crore in the year-ago period.

Subir Chakraborty, MD & CEO of Exide, said, ‘The company has delivered strong growth with sales growing at 20% in the second quarter of the current financial year. Both the automotive and the industrial SBUs are seeing demand recovery compared to the same quarter previous year and to the previous quarter of the current year. However, gross profit increase was restricted due to unprecedented cost inflation of inputs.” According to him, Exide has taken multiple initiatives in the past few quarters which should drive sales and help improve performance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exide-q2-net-up-2-4-to-rs-234-cr/articleshow/87378144.cms||---

Incidentally, one of the pioneers in cycle manufacturing in independent India, Sen-Raleigh, had its base in the state. In 1952, Sen-Raleigh bicycle manufacturing unit was set up in Kanyapur, Asansol. Later on, it was taken over by the centre under Cycle Corporation of India. Currently, there is no cycle manufacturing facility in the state. Sources in the state government told TOI that the investor would be offered land in industrial parks like Vidyasagar Industrial Park (Kharagpur), Panagarh Industrial Park (Burdwan), Industrial park in Howrah or in industrial park in Purulia. “If the investor has his own land we can provide other facilities,” an official added. This includes 100% exemption of stamp duty and registration fees for land. Waiver of the electricity duty for five years along with other benefits. As per the EOI floated by WBIDC, the state government had launched the “Sabooj Sathi” scheme in 2015 to enhance access of students to secondary education. Under the scheme, bicycles are distributed to students between class IX and XII studying in government run and government aided schools and madrashas in West Bengal. “For this purpose, there is a need to procure 10 lakh bicycles every year in West Bengal. Apart from that, environment-friendly bicycles are the need of the hour for reducing pollution related health hazards in the State of West Bengal. Demand for bicycles rose in various urban areas of India amid COVID-19 pandemic,” it added. According to industry experts, assured buying of 10 lakh bicycles every year could give a manufacturer an immediate break even opportunity which could lure big names. Hero Cycle CMD Pankaj Munjal during the Bengal Global Business Summit in 2017 had announced its intention to set up a unit here. Further elaborating the advantage of the state the EOI, WBIDC stated that West Bengal is the sixth largest state of India in economic size with a GSDP of Rs 14.4 lakh crore ($206.6 billion) in 2020-21. State GDP has been growing at an average of 12.6% between 2015-16 and 2020-21, faster than the national average. It has stated that the intention is to promote, facilitate and financially incentivize investment in production of bicycle and bicycle related spare parts in West Bengal, through an enabling environment. “To create local employment opportunities through promotion of production of bicycle and bicycle related spare parts in West Bengal. To nurture MSMEs/ Start-ups to support localization of production of bicycle and bicycle related spare parts in West Bengal,” it added.

Leander’s entry into TMC will encourage a lot of youngsters to come forth,” said Banerjee. Although Paes was born in Kolkata, his father, Vece, is of Goan origin and the party hopes that Paes’ induction will boost its chances in Goa, which goes to polls early next year. “Now that I have retired from tennis, I would like to come under the guidance of a very powerful lady... and make a difference where my roots are,” Paes said. He said though he was born in West Bengal, Goa is also his home as he lives here. He said that he wanted to give something back to Goa. The 48-year-old athlete, the only Indian sportsperson to compete in seven Olympic games, recalled how Banerjee encouraged him to pursue the sport when he was a teen. “I was a 14-year-old boy aspiring to be a tennis player for our country, and Didi was the sports minister of Bengal at that time, and she was very, very encouraging, and later supportive as sports minister of India,” he said. Paes received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996-97, the Padma Shri in 2001, and the Padma Bhushan in January 2014. Earlier in the day, actor Nafisa Ali, too, joined the party in the presence of Banerjee, who is on a three-day visit to the state. Ali, who won the Femina Miss India title in 1976 and was the second runner-up at the Miss International contest, had unsuccessfully contested the 2004 Lok Sabha elections from South Kolkata against Banerjee. Mrinalini Deshprabhu too joined TMC on Friday. Didi paid a visit to the Mahalsa Narayani Temple, Mardol. She also visited Tapobhoomi — Shree Datta Padmanabh Peeth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/leander-joins-tmc-to-make-difference-where-my-roots-are/articleshow/87378205.cms||---

A division bench comprising Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Rabindranath Samanta transferred the case back to CAT's Kolkata bench and asked it to hear the case "expeditiously'. "The entire modus operandi adopted by the Union of India reeks of mala fides. It is unfortunate that the CAT's principal bench nurtured (those) efforts, paying obeisance to the diktat of the Union of India," the order said, stressing that the SC and various HCs had repeatedly said the Union government could not be treated as a "favoured litigant". The CAT transfer order "poses a threat to the federal structure as envisioned by the makers of the Constitution of India," the HC said. The Centre's department of personnel and training initiated proceedings against Bandyopadhay in June following a political controversy over PM Modi's review meeting on Cyclone Yaas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-cats-order-on-ex-bengal-cs-alapan-shocks-judicial-conscience/articleshow/87381509.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh bypolls today; dissidents keep both BJP & Congress on the edge||SHIMLA: Voting for the byelections to Mandi parliamentary constituency and three assembly seats — Fatehpur, Arki, and Jubbal-Kotkhai — in Himachal Pradesh will take place on Saturday. The counting of votes will take place on November 2. These bypolls would decide the fate of many leaders from both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress in the 2022 assembly elections. The main focus of this byelection would be the Mandi parliamentary seat, where the prestige of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and the family of former chief minister late Virbhadra Singh is directly at stake. Six candidates are in fray in this constituency — Brig Khushal Chand Thakur (retd) of BJP, Pratibha Singh of Congress, Ambika Shyam of Rashtriya Lokniti Party, Munshi Ram Thakur of Himachal Jankranti Party and independent candidates Anil Kumar and Subhash Mohan Snehi. However, the main contest is going to remain between BJP’s Thakur and Congress’s Pratibha. Both Congress and BJP are facing dissidence in this seat. In the last two parliamentary elections of 2014 and 2019, BJP had won this seat. Though the chief minister is focussing on maintaining the party’s winning streak, it would still be a keenly followed contest. BJP is facing the challenge of pacifying the voters on issues of inflation, besides dealing with the emotional card being played by Congress in the name of Virbhadra. The road is not that easy for Congress too, as voters are weighing Pratibha’s performance as MP in her last two tenures. Mandi parliamentary seat is one of the toughest and remotest constituencies of the country, and some villages are deprived of road connectivity and lack development. In Arki assembly constituency of Solan district, Ratan Singh Pal (BJP), Sanjay Awasthi (Congress) and Jeet Ram (independent) are in the fray. However, here too the main contest is expected between BJP and Congress. The presence of dissidents, who were denied tickets, has become a cause of worry for both BJP and Congress as they can spoil the calculations of both these parties. Congress’s ticket to Awasthi prompted revolt by Rajender Thakur, a staunch Virbhadra loyalist, and his expulsion from the party along with his supporters. Similarly, BJP gave a ticket to Ratan Singh Pal, much to the annoyance of former MLA Govind Ram Sharma and his supporters. Though Union minister Anurag Thakur tried to pacify Sharma, the latter distanced himself from the campaigning. In Fatehpur seat of Kangra district, Baldev Thakur (BJP), Bhawani Singh Pathania (Congress), Pankaj Kumar Darshi (HJP) and independent candidates Ashok Kumar Somal and Rajan Sushant are in the fray. A triangular contest is expected here between Thakur, Pathania and Sushant. Here, too, presence of dissidents is a worrying factor for both BJP and Congress. Four candidates contesting from Jubbal-Kotkhai constituency of Shimla district include Neelam Saraik (BJP), Rohit Thakur (Congress), Chetan Singh Bragta and Suman Kadam (independent candidates). A triangular contest is expected between Bragta and the candidates of BJP and Congress. Webcasting for 50% polling stations In these byelections, 50% of the polling stations will be connected through webcasting, which would be available in 1,383 polling stations out of 2,796 set up for the byelections. Six companies of paramilitary forces have been posted to ensure fair and peaceful conduct of the elections in the state. Two companies would be deployed in Mandi parliamentary constituency, while one company each would be Jubbal-Kotkhai, Arki, and Fatehpur assembly seats. Voters would exercise their franchise at 2,796 polling stations. Of these, 48 have been declared sensitive and 267 as very sensitive. State police personnel along with paramilitary forces would be involved in the monitoring of sensitive and highly sensitive polling stations and EVMs, VVPATs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/hp-bypolls-today-dissidents-keep-both-bjp-cong-on-the-edge/articleshow/87379229.cms||---

---||India||Chief secy, CP will be liable if cracker rules flouted: SC||NEW DELHI: Noting that its order to ban polluting firecrackers is not being implemented by state governments and the fireworks are still being manufactured and sold, the Supreme Court on Friday said top bureaucrats, including chief secretaries and police commissioners, shall be held personally liable for violation of its order in "true spirit and in toto". Ahead of the festive season, a bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna warned any violation of its order would be taken very seriously and said it is the duty of all the states and state agencies to see that directions issued by the court are strictly complied with. "No authority can be permitted the violation of the directions issued by this Court and permit banned firecrackers under the guise of celebration. Celebration cannot be at the cost of the other's health. Under the guise of celebration, nobody can be permitted to infringe the right to health of others...(under Article 21)...and nobody can be permitted to play with the lives of others, more particularly senior citizens and children," the court said. "Any lapse on part of the state governments, state agencies and UTs shall be viewed very seriously and if it is found that any banned firecrackers are manufactured, sold and used in any particular area, the chief secretary of the concerned state(s), the secretary (homes) of the concerned state(s) and the commissioner of police of the concerned area, district SP of the concerned area and the SHO/police officer in-charge of the concerned police station shall be held personally liable," the bench said. The bench said any wilful and deliberate diso-bedience shall have to be viewed very seriously. "It prima facie appears that the implementing agencies of the concerned states either lack desire to implement the directions issued by this Court or they close their eyes for whatever reasons," it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chief-secy-cp-will-be-liable-if-cracker-rules-flouted-sc/articleshow/87381523.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Goa||Sardinha reiterates his anti-alliance poll stand||Margao: Reiterating his stance against Congress forging an alliance with any other party for the 2022 assembly elections, South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha on Friday said the party was capable of winning more seats than it did in 2017 by contesting the polls on its own strength. “We have told our leadership that the rank and file of the party are against an alliance,” Sardinha said. “I have placed my views on an alliance before the party. The party will decide on it.” He, however, said that though he would accept whatever decision the party takes on an alliance, “people wouldn’t like it”. “So that’s why I have told the party let’s go alone as usual,” he said. Asked to comment on the views in favour of an alliance within Congress, Sardinha said, “Only those who are indebted to them want Congress to have an alliance with them.” He, however, didn’t take any names. He said that certain politicians who were now seeking an alliance with Congress were the ones who were bitterly criticising the party in the past. “Once, one said Congressmen are monkeys. So did he now realise they are humans?” he said. On political strategist Prashant Kishor statement that BJP was here to stay for long, he said, “All the new parties that have come to Goa are here only to help BJP.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sardinha-reiterates-his-anti-alliance-poll-stand/articleshow/87378344.cms||---

The farm outfit stated that Congress leaders would be gheraoed across Punjab, like BJP leaders. The blockade of DAC was started on Monday and the employees were not allowed to enter the offices for the entire week ending on Friday. The outfit is demanding Rs 60,000 per acre as compensation and stated that the state government is now trying to drastically lower the area in the ongoing girdawari where crop has damaged. “We blocked residence of finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal for 15 days and the Bathinda DAC for five days, but even then the government is unmoved. Instead, it is trying to cut short the crop-damaged area. Now we have decided to gherao ministers and MLAs after lifting the protest. We will take on Congress leaders wherever they go and will continue defacing posters of CM wherein claims of fair compensation for damage to crop have been made,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) state secretary Shingara Singh Mann.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/blockade-of-bathinda-district-office-ends-farm-activists-to-gherao-cong-ministers-mlas/articleshow/87379372.cms||---
---||Business||Govt's vaccine spends set to scale 50,000cr||NEW DELHI: The Centre's vaccine spend is set to top Rs 50,000 crore, significantly higher than the budget estimate of Rs 35,000 crore, but is unlikely to put pressure on government finances. The numbers are based on current trends and do not factor in the possibility of vaccinating the population under 18 years, which is expected to start later in the financial year. While the revenue position is currently healthy, government sources said the Centre is looking to tap special windows from multilateral agencies such as ADB to raise around $2 billion at concessional rates, joining others such as China and Indonesia. This, officials said, will ensure that there is no pressure on market borrowings, leaving enough room for the private sector to raise funds. Although the market is looking at the tax numbers, prompting many analysts to conclude that the fiscal deficit numbers may be better than the estimated 6.8% of GDP, sources said, the government had also committed higher spending in several areas, for which additional funds will be required. Latest data released by the controller general of accounts on Friday pegged the Centre's fiscal deficit at Rs 5.3 lakh crore during the first half of the current financial year, which was 35% of its full year budget target as robust tax revenues helped keep government finances in much better shape. At the end of September 2020, fiscal deficit was estimated 114.8% of the estimate. This was perhaps the best fiscal outcome in the first half of 2021-22 in about 20 years, aided largely by healthy revenues and efficient spending management. Acceleration in economic activity after lifting of curbs helped revenues recover and keep the fiscal situation in a better shape. Receipts from excise duty were up 79% compared to the same period last year, largely due to the increase in global crude oil prices and the higher local taxes on fuel. Tax revenues reached 59.6% of full year budget estimates, higher than the 28% growth in the previous fiscal year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govts-vaccine-spends-set-to-scale-50000cr/articleshow/87381585.cms||---

Ambala deputy director agriculture (DDA) Girish Nagpal said fertilisers were being sold illegally to people in other states through some dealers in Ambala district and the data did not match with PoS (point of sale) machines as compared to the physically available fertilizers. The firms include Antal Beej Bhandar and Lakshmi Trading Company in Ambala city, and Ram Pesticide in Nanyola village. An investigation was conducted by the department of the firms in the presence of farmers. The DDA said under Section 8(2), 8(3) and Section 31 of the Fertilizer Control Order, 1985, the licences of accused three firms had been suspended for the next 15 days. Along with this, all leading fertilizer supplying companies of the state have been warned against wrongdoings. The DDA said as per the instructions by the deputy commissioner, intensive investigation of all traders of fertilizers was going on. He added farmers could inform officials on the helpline number 94655-50570 in case of any complaint related to black marketing and packaging (forcibly giving unnecessary items) of fertilizers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/discrepancy-in-stock-of-fertilizers-in-ambala-licences-of-3-firms-suspended/articleshow/87379379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Analysts don't seem to think so. As Jio announced the launch of the first jointly developed affordable smartphone (JioPhone Next), aimed at capturing the large number of feature phone buyers, at an upfront price of Rs 6,499 or a data-bundled EMI plan (18-24 months) after a down-payment of Rs 1,999, analysts did not read much into the challenge. Meanwhile, it has informed the telecom department it won't avail the four-year spectrum payment moratorium. While the phone aims at tapping into, and upgrading, the roughly 350-400 million feature phone customers, analysts said that the EMI plans - starting at Rs 300 and above - are expensive and not very lucrative for the targeted audience. "It is out of sync of market realities and is priced higher than what was expected," Navkendar Singh, research director at IDC, told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-googles-new-smartphone-fails-to-impress-experts/articleshow/87381653.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Delhi||Diwali cheer: Cinemas in Delhi can run at full capacity||NEW DELHI: The festive season has brought some cheer to film exhibitors with the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowing - for the first time since the Covid outbreak in the city - all cinema halls, multiplexes and theatres to function with 100% seating capacity from November 1. Till now, a 50% cap has been in place. They will, however, need to ensure the use of masks by everyone, make sanitisers and thermal screening available, allow a longer intermission to let people sitting in different rows to move in a staggered manner and ensure staggered entry and exit. The number of visitors at weddings and funerals has also been increased to 200. Restaurants and bars will, however, continue with half of their seating capacity. Cinema operators laud move to lift seating capCinema halls, multiplexes and theatres will not allow any symptomatic individual to enter besides following other measures listed by the ministry of information & broadcasting in its SOP. The development comes a day after the Delhi government announced that the sixth sero survey conducted in the city had revealed a sero prevalence of 97%, leading to speculation about herd immunity. All schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutes will be allowed to open from Monday for all classes with 50% of the seating capacity of a classroom, as announced earlier. "The owners of restaurants, bars, cinemas and multiplexes will be responsible for strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and the guidelines issued from time to time to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus. In case, any violation is found, strict penal/criminal action shall be taken against the owner," said the DDMA order. The SOP about multiplexes lays down that adequate physical distancing of at least six feet must be followed outside the auditoriums, common areas and waiting areas all the time, respiratory etiquette must be maintained, self-monitoring of health should be undertaken, spitting shall be strictly prohibited and efforts should be made to avoid overcrowding in common areas. Any case of illness should be reported at the earliest to the state or district helpline. Cinema operators have welcomed the move. "We are extremely pleased that the Delhi government has permitted multiplexes and theatres to operate at 100% capacity," said Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Limited. "With Maharashtra just reopening its cinemas and Delhi waiving restrictions, with some other states having already done so, we are optimistic of a quick revival of the film exhibition business," he said. Rajeev Patni, COO of INOX Leisure Ltd, described the move as "an extremely positive step towards normalcy". Mall operators are expecting footfall to rise. "It will mean a lot more people visiting the malls if there is a steady flow of content," said Abhishek Bansal of Pacific Malls. The multiplexes have been asked to have staggered show timings for multiple screens to avoid crowding and use digital no-contact transactions for issuing, verifying and accepting payments for tickets, food and beverages. Contact numbers shall be taken at the time of booking of tickets to facilitate contact tracing and advance booking must be allowed to avoid crowding at the ticket counters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/diwali-cheer-cinemas-in-delhi-can-run-at-full-capacity/articleshow/87381684.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: From next week, pay Rs 1,000 for not wearing helmet or seatbelt||MUMBAI: From next week, bikers not wearing helmets and those in car without wearing seatbelt are likely to be fined Rs 1,000. Such errant bikers may also face the risk of losing their licence for three months. The state government on Friday cleared the decks for a hefty increase in fines for traffic offences as per the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2019. It will be notified by Monday, an official said. For drink driving, the penalty will be decided by court after prosecution, sources said. The new MV Act provides for maximum 6 months in jail and/or Rs 10,000 fine for first offence, while it is maximum 2 years jail and /or Rs 15,000 fine for a second offence. Motorists may be fined Rs 1k for having fancy number platesWe decided to reduce fines under certain sections that we felt were hefty," transport minister Anil Parab told TOI. He added that the state government decided to implement revised fines to bring in road discipline and reduce accidents.  The state government had deferred implementation of the MV Act 2019. The transport department, headed by Shiv Sena and even in the previous Sena-BJP government was not keen on implementing the new fines, and had called them 'steep' and demanded the Centre review them. Senior officials said the issue was under discussion and the state government reduced the amount under certain offences. Sources said some fines proposed could be Rs1,000 for fancy number plates, for vehicles with no reflector/tail lamps, for riding two-wheeler without helmet, for not wearing seatbelt, for speeding bikes and for driving without permits, and Rs 2,000 for speeding cars and for overloading. An official said, "The final notification is likely on Monday when actual fines and punishment will be made public." A senior transport official said, "Hefty fines will act as a major deterrent for offenders and will reduce crashes in the state." The state has witnessed 12,000-13,000 fatalities on an average every year and the transport department wants to reduce this with Mission Zero Fatality. A member of Mumbai Mobility Forum said several bike riders need to be disciplined and there was an urgent need for stringent enforcement against those not wearing helmets, riding triple seat, speeding and lane-cutting. In January, state transport minister Anil Parab had said the state will procure 75 interceptor vehicles with speed guns that will be used by the RTO or police flying squads to nab speedsters in the Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/from-next-week-pay-rs-1000-for-not-wearing-helmet-or-seatbelt/articleshow/87381814.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kolkata||4 Bengal seats go to bypolls today||Kolkata: It was a 2-2 score in May for the seats going to bypoll on Saturday. While BJP bagged Dinhata in Cooch Behar and Santipur in Nadia, Trinamool won Khardah in North 24 Parganas and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas. A triumphant TMC, with 213 of 294 seats in the assembly, aims at breaking the north-south divide now. While party national secretary Abhishek Banerjee is in charge of TMC’s campaign, the BJP brigade is being led by Sukanta Majumdar, Dilip Ghosh and Suvendu Adhikari. There are central forces in booths and central observers, but the scene is not like the one during the assembly polls. The lack of enthusiasm among voters could result in a slide in the polling percentage. Banerjee had sensed it and scripted his campaign as part of the ‘Save India’ move by Trinamool reaching out to states like Tripura, Goa, Assam and Uttar Pradesh. The aim was to maximize anti-BJP votes by sending out signals that only CM Mamata Banerjee could oust the BJP out of office. The Bengal BJP is primarily banking on polarisation of “sanatani Hindu” voters, lapping up the cause of the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh. How far this influences voters in the two border seats Dinhata and Santipur will only be known on November 2. A major handicap for BJP was that its leaders had nothing to deliver that the party’s central leaders had offered during the assembly campaign. BJP seniors harped on the “negatives of social schemes Lakshmir Bhandar and Swasthya Sathi health cards” and the “failure of the Duare Ration programme” for all these months but couldn’t develop a ground activity with those who were “denied” the services. Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay, Subrata Mandal, Udayan Guha and Braja Kishore Goswami are TMC’s nominees from Khardah, Gosaba, Dinhata and Santipur, respectively.

A bleeding Sandhya Mahata was first rushed to a local hospital and later admitted to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. Doctors said the Class VIII was stable and out of danger. The incident sparked tension in the area. Sandhya’s father Swapan Mahata alleged that this wasn’t a stray incident and that the EFR firing range compromised the safety of Tangasole residents. He claimed villagers had informed officers of the threat after similar incidents in the past. Midnapore West SP Dinesh Kumar confirmed the injury. “Personnel of Jhargram police district were practising at the Salua range. During the practice, a splinter accidentally hit a village teenager,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/splinter-injures-15-year-old-girl-near-salua-firing-range-of-efr/articleshow/87378496.cms||Sujoy Khanra

A division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Rabindranath Samanta transferred the case back to the CAT’s Kolkata bench and asked it to hear the case “expeditiously”, calling the CAT transfer order an effort to pay “obeisance to the diktat” of the central government. “The entire modus operandi adopted by the Union of India reeks of mala fides. It is unfortunate that the CAT’s principal bench nurtured (those) efforts, paying obeisance to the diktat of the Union of India,” the 18-page order said, stressing that the Supreme Court and various high courts had repeatedly said the Union government could not be treated as a “favoured litigant”. “Rather, the responsibility of meting out justice and serving the cause of justice is on a much higher pedestal,” the order added. The CAT transfer order “leaves a bad taste in the mouth due to the mode of operation of a quasi-judicial (if not judicial) authority and also poses a threat to the federal structure as envisioned by the makers of the Constitution”, the bench said. The Centre’s department of personnel and training initiated proceedings against Bandyopadhay in June following a political controversy over PM Narendra Modi’s review meeting on Cycle Yaas in Kalaikunda, about 130 km from Kolkata. Bandyopadhyay responded, explaining the sequence of events, following which the centre set up a panel to probe the charges against him. Bandyopadhyay moved CAT’s Kolkata bench against this but the case was transferred to Delhi before a single hearing here. Bandyopadhyay then moved the Calcutta HC against this transfer. The HC division bench said on Friday that “promptness is appreciated but over-zealousness to cater to the fiat of the government, be it central or state, is not” and found in the CAT order an “inexplicable hot haste of the bench to cater to the pseudo-urgency of the union government”. It also questioned the centre’s “unprecedented restlessness” to complete the inquiry before Bandyopadhyay’s case was taken up by the CAT Kolkata bench. Bandyopadhyay’s petition prompted three questions, the HC said: whether it (the HC) could hear an order passed by a CAT principal bench based in Delhi; whether the CAT’s Delhi bench had exceeded its powers in acting in a case filed in Kolkata; and whether the case transfer from Kolkata to Delhi was justified. The incident that led to the entire issue took place in Bengal on May 28, the HC said, adding that many of the following events (including Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s letter to PM Modi) originated in Kolkata. That gave the Calcutta HC “territorial jurisdiction”, the bench said. The judges also noted that Bandyopadhyay, resident of Kolkata, was given less than 24 hours to respond to the transfer notice. “The extreme alacrity of the CAT bench did not stop there but it went on to hear and dispose of the entire transfer petition the very next day,” the HC said, adding that Bandyopadhyay was not granted “reasonable time to come ready with a comprehensive objection, arguments and appropriate citations”. The judges then questioned how the CAT’s Delhi bench could “pre-judge” that most witnesses would be from Delhi, which prompted the basis of the transfer order. “Bandyopadhyay’s alleged recalcitrance on May 28, 2021, took place within the territorial jurisdiction of the CAT’s Kolkata bench and the charges against him (followed) the communication from the Bengal CM, which could also be a potentially importance piece of evidence. Other witnesses, if any, would be available in Kalaikunda in Bengal and not in New Delhi,” the bench noted, saying that CAT order “not only violates Bandyopadhyay’s legal right” but also his fundamental right of “equality before law”. Fox & Mandal, Kolkata, partner Debanjan Mandal, who represented Bandyopadhyay, declined to comment in detail on the HC verdict. “We hope that the judicial and quasi-judicial processes will lead to justice,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/alapan-cat-order-shocks-judicial-conscience-hc/articleshow/87379744.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Dev also sought the SC’s direction so that party leaders could campaign and contest civic polls in Tripura on November 25. She further pleaded that Trinamool workers be provided security and incidents of attack against them be probed expeditiously. In her 147-page petition, Dev said that from attacks on party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee in Agartala on August 2 to the October 22 attack on her and other party workers, Trinamool leaders and supporters in Tripura had been attacked repeatedly by BJP, and no action had been taken despite complaints filed in police stations. FIRs were being filed but none was being arrested, Dev said. The MP alleged that Trinamool workers were being slapped with criminal cases and being hounded by police. Dev argued this showed how the civil and police administrations were working in tandem with the party in office in the northeastern state. Dev also said that the Tripura government had been routinely denying Trinamool permission to hold political programmes. The plea said the Tripura High Court had been moved but was on vacation till November 7. TMC says the Tripura state election commission declared civic polls for November 25. The filing of nomination papers commenced on October 27 and would end on November 3. The last day for withdrawal of nominations is November 8.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tripura-attacks-sushmita-in-sc-for-sit-probe/articleshow/87378493.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Calcutta HC bans all fireworks till year-end||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Friday issued a blanket ban on fireworks — whether light- or sound-emitting — till the end of the year for the second year on the trot, overriding an order issued by the state pollution control board two days ago that allowed green crackers for two hours during Kali Puja, Diwali and Chhath Puja and 35 minutes on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Only wax- or oil-based diyas or earthen lamps will be permitted. The state fireworks association said it would move the Supreme Court against the order. Reimposing the cracker ban that the court had announced last year as well — on account of the pandemic, during which increased air pollution can lead to serious complications in Covid patients suffering from respiratory distress — the Calcutta High Court vacation bench of justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Aniruddha Roy remarked that a blanket ban was being imposed keeping in mind practical realities, as there was no mechanism in place to ascertain whether a cracker being sold, burst or lit complied with norms and qualified to be termed a “green cracker”. State advocate general S N Mookherjee, along with state pollution control board lawyer N C Bihani and lawyers representing firecracker manufacturers, contended that the National Green Tribunal, as well as the Supreme Court, had permitted the use of green crackers for a few hours of the day. Srijib Chakraborty, counsel for firecrackers manufacturers’ association, further submitted that if certified green crackers were also banned, it would amount to huge losses for the industry that had invested heavily — both money and human resources — in manufacturing green crackers for this year’s festival season. The vacation bench, however, rejected the appeal, pointing out that it would be an impossible task for the police to ascertain the veracity of the certificates of crackers, irrespective of the classification under which they were sold. “Leaving the window open for the use of green crackers would positively entail abundant abuse of such a window,” the order said, adding, “Keeping in mind the present pandemic situation and in view of the fact that even moderate dip in air quality can cause severe difficulties for people suffering from respiratory problems and long exposure may also affect otherwise healthy people, we are not convinced that firecrackers of any form, either green or of any other category, ought to be permitted during the coming festive season.” The fireworks ban would cover all festivals this year, including Chhath, Jagaddharti Puja, Guru Nanak’s birthday, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Friday’s order specifically mentions that its ban would cover all types of fireworks, whether they emit sound or light or both when burst, lit or burned. “The state should ensure there is no use or display or bursting of firecrackers of any type during celebrations. Only wax- or oil-based diyas or earthen lamps can be used,” the court said. The HC also made it clear that the green cracker norms were “not under challenge before us”. It was more concerned about attempts to pass of polluting crackers as “green crackers” and the enforcement of green cracker norms, it clarified. In 2020, too, the HC had banned firecrackers ahead of Kali Puja to curb pollution amid the pandemic. The state government had also appealed to citizens to avoid bursting firecrackers to check air pollution. Environmentalists and doctors lauded the order. Pointing out that crackers emit sulphur dioxide, various oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, all of which affect the lungs, they said the use of fireworks could have significantly increased the risk of Covid attacks, as SO2 directly irritates the respiratory system, while oxides of nitrogen enhance oxidative stress and erode the protective mucosal layer of the lungs. Diptendra Sarkar, professor, Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER), said: “The ban on firecrackers will have both direct and indirect benefits. First, it will reduce gatherings and prevent transmission at a time Covid numbers are rising. Secondly, it will help those suffering from Covid by reducing pollution, which is harmful for the lungs. Many of them have cardiac ailments as well, which is accentuated by firecrackers.” The firecracker industry expressed dismay. “We will move Supreme Court to protect the industry and 33 lakh workers, whose life and livelihood is at stake,” said Sara Bangla Atashbaji Unnayan Samity chairman Babla Roy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cal-hc-bans-all-fireworks-till-yr-end/articleshow/87379741.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||West Bengal permits local trains, eases public footfall norms||KOLKATA: Local trains will be allowed to ply from Sunday (October 31) after a gap of six months, and schools, colleges and universities will be allowed to reopen for on-campus classes from November 16 in a slew of eased restrictions announced by the Bengal government on Friday. The notice also permits more footfall in public places from Sunday, something that was closely regulated — with periodic modifications — since the pandemic began: cinema halls, theatres, auditoriums, malls, markets, restaurants, gyms and spas will be allowed to operate at 70% capacity, up from 50%, till 11pm, from which time the night restrictions kick in. Night-time restrictions between 11pm and 5am will remain, except for four nights (November 2 to 5) during Kali Puja-Diwali and two nights (November 10-11) during Chhath Puja, as it had been for 10 days during Durga Puja. There was some concern and lack of clarity about the extended closing time, though. “We are waiting for clarity on this,” said Sudesh Poddar, president, Hotel & Restaurant Association of Eastern India. Regular local train services, which had been suspended since May 6, when restrictions were imposed because of surging infections during the second wave, can resume services with half their maximum carrying capacity. At present, Eastern Railway (ER) and South Eastern Railway are operating special services. ER, which runs the majority of suburban services in the state, is ready to operate its entire fleet of local trains as services recommence. Officials ruled out a phased restart, unlike last year. The restoration of full-fledged services will not only come as a relief for office-goers, but would help students as well. Schools, colleges and universities, which have remained shut since March 2020 (schools had reopened briefly for classes IX to XII in February-April 2021) will finally reopen from November 16. While there is no restriction on the number of students allowed on college and university campuses, only students of classes IX to XII have been allowed back to physical classrooms. The education department, on Thursday, had issued a detailed set of guidelines on how educational institutions would be allowed to function. The Bengal government on Friday extended these SOPs to all school, colleges and universities across Bengal. Coaching centres for competitive exams, which had been allowed to open earlier with 50% capacity, can now allow 70% students to return to classrooms. A similar capacity-relaxation has been announced for indoor social gatherings — including weddings — and film and TV series shoots. There is no restriction in numbers if the shoots are outdoors, but distancing and other Covid protocol must be followed, the notification specifies. The restrictions and relaxations contained in the new order will be in force till November 30, after which the government will review the situation and issue the next set of guidelines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-permits-local-trains-eases-public-footfall-norms/articleshow/87379656.cms||---

The 8.5% rate of interest on provident fund deposits for the last financial year was decided by the EPFO's apex decision making body Central Board of Trustees (CBT) headed by labour minister in March this year. A source said on Friday, "The rate of interest on EPF for 2020-21 has been ratified by the ministry of finance and now it would be credited into the accounts of over five crore subscribers." In March last year, the EPFO had lowered interest rate on provident fund deposits to a seven-year low of 8.5% for 2019-20, from 8.65% in 2018-19. The EPF (Employees Provident Fund) interest rate provided for 2019-20 was the lowest since 2012-13, when it was brought down to 8.5%. The EPFO had provided 8.65% interest rate to its subscribers in 2016-17 and 8.55 % in 2017-18. The rate of interest was slightly higher at 8.8% in 2015-16.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-oks-8-5-interest-rate-for-provident-funds-for-last-fiscal/articleshow/87381967.cms||---
---||India||Over 40cr Indians don't have any financial cover for health expenses: Niti||NEW DELHI: At least 30% of India's population - 40 crore individuals - is still devoid of any financial protection through health insurance even as its coverage has increased substantially over the past few years with the launch of the government's Ayushman Bharat scheme for 'deprived' familes, a new report by Niti Aayog says. It underlines the need for a low-cost comprehensive insurance product designed for the "missing middle" that is presently neither covered by private sector schemes or under state or central schemes even though it has the ability to pay nominal premiums. "Private voluntary health insurance is designed for high-income groups - it costs at least two to three times the affordable level for the missing middle. Affordable contributory products such as ESIC, and government subsidised insurance, including PMJAY are closed products. They are not available to the general population due to the risk of adverse selection," the report 'Health Insurance for India's Missing Middle' says. The 'missing middle', positioned between the poorer sections and the relatively well-off organised sector, predominantly constitutes the self-employed (agriculture and non-agriculture) informal sector in rural areas and a broad array of occupations - informal, semi-formal and formal - in urban areas. The government thinktank suggests the private as well as the public sector to build a modified, standardised product to cover all disease treatments at the earliest as well as out-patient benefits. It also recommends extending PMJAY and ESIC services to this uncovered segment through subsidised coverage at low premiums. "In the short term, the focus should be on expanding private voluntary insurance through commercial insurers. In the medium term, once the supply-side and utilization of PMJAY and ESIC is strengthened, their infrastructure can be leveraged to allow voluntary contributions to a PMJAY plus product, or to ESIC's existing medical benefits. In the long-term, once the low-cost voluntary contributory health insurance market is developed, expansion of PMJAY to the uncovered poorer segments of the missing middle should be considered," the report says. Participation of the National Health Authority that monitor implementation of PMJAY, and ESIC will also increase competition in the contributory voluntary insurance market, reducing premiums and improving quality of care provided, the report says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-40cr-indians-dont-have-any-financial-cover-for-health-expenses-niti/articleshow/87382021.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||India seeking vax cert recognition from G20 leaders for international travel||NEW DELHI: India is seeking a commitment from G20 leaders for mutual recognition of travel documents, including testing and vaccine certificates, with its demand finding support from some other countries, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, who is also the Sherpa for the talks said on Friday. "There is broad consensus. All nations wish to restart travel, restart economic activity, and bring back normalcy... We are working towards an acceptable language to bring in the G20 framework," Goyal told reporters. Asked if the agenda was on recognition of vaccines or certificates, the minister said members are seeking to focus on building capacity for faster approval of vaccines. "In terms of recognition of vaccines and their certifications, we all also recognise what nations would have as public policy and their own requirements of transparency, efficacy or public health and safety. We are quite confident that there is broad consensus and the language is being worked out on how we can bring it in." G20 leaders are meeting in Italy over the weekend, where health and climate change issues are expected to dominate the agenda. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is also in Rome, holding consultations with her counterparts for the establishment of a forum and possibly a fund for pandemic preparedness and reforms. "Emphasising the need to act fast and act now, (the) FM called for swift and strong multilateral cooperation, effective governance and sustained financing for pandemic preparedness...," the finance ministry said in a tweet on Sitharaman's intervention at the joint forum of finance and health ministers. On Friday she met the UK chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak and her Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-seeking-vax-cert-recognition-from-g20-leaders-for-international-travel/articleshow/87382052.cms||---
---||India||UP polls will extend BJP victory run: Shah||LUCKNOW: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday said BJP's victory in the UP assembly elections next year would prolong the party's victory run. Affirming that the Yogi government in UP managed to fulfil "more than 90%" of the promises it made to the people in the 2017 assembly elections, Shah on Friday exhorted party workers here to expeditiously carry out the membership drive and get feedback from maximum number of households, which will help the party brass in devising its election manifesto for 2022 assembly elections. Shah stressed that the BJP government turned UP into the country's second largest economic state from 7th position it acquired before 2017. Shah said BJP required another five-year term to completely remove the maladies which infested the state during the previous SP and BSP regimes. BJP's membership drive is said to have played a pivotal role in its overwhelming electoral success in UP during 2014, 2019 Lok Sabha and in 2017 assembly elections. Shah said the fresh membership drive was like sounding a poll bugle for the forthcoming state elections. He said while opposition parties saw elections as a "means to usurp power", BJP saw it as an opportunity to spread its ideology to every household, understanding people's problems and bringing welfare schemes of the government to their doorsteps. Shah remarked that though a BJP worker believed in "family planning", the party tended to "break the rule" to expand its base. "Hence the membership drive, which will help in expanding the party footprint," he said. The drive will be carried out till December 31. Shah pitched the revocation of Article 370 from J&K as one of the key promises it made in its previous election manifestos.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-polls-will-extend-bjp-victory-run-shah/articleshow/87382117.cms||---
