Being the panna pramukh he will reach out to those voters who have their names on the same page with him. He will not be the only panna pramukh for that booth because the voter list may be long. Depending on the number of pages the voter list has, there will be one panna pramukh for every page. In that case, a booth may have multiple panna pramukhs whose ultimate job will be to sway the voter in the party’s favour by telling them about the welfare schemes of the BJP government at the centre and in the state and other achievements that brought laurels for the country, nationally and internationally. “If there are more than one party functionaries who have their names figuring on the same page of the voter list, the senior most will have the responsibility,” said a party functionary. A page of the voter list has about 60 names and that will add up to around 12 families. Like chief minister Yogi Adityanath, every MP, MLA and office-bearer of the party will be a panna pramukh for the booth where he is registered as a voter. In Gorakhpur, former Union minister and MP Shiv Pratap Shukla, MLA Dr Radha Mohan Das Agrawal and mayor Sitaram Jaiswal are also the panna pramukhs for the booths where they are registered as voters. At a time when most of the political parties in the state are trying to reach out to voters and it’s the lack of an organizational set-up that might make it a little difficult for them to do so, state BJP has its vast army of foot soldiers, elected people’s representatives and popular leaders of the national stature as its biggest strength. The party has a strength of 50 lakh `panna pramukh’ in a state which has around 1.6 lakh booths. With that, the state BJP will go to forge a man-to-man, door-to-door connectivity with voters. The party’s’main bhi panna pramukh’ campaign was launched on October 8 when the state party president Swatantra Dev Singh assumed the responsibility for his booth to start the campaign. The state BJP, which has already gone micro in its election strategy since 2014, has harped big time on panna pramukhs. “Prior to this, panna pramukhs were appointed a few days ahead of the elections and it was never with such a bang,” said the party leader. It was decided in the executive committee meeting of the state BJP held in March that panna pramukh will be a permanent appointee. A panna pramukh is a booth level functionary. Each of them have been verified by the party. And, they will have a key role in the party’s membership drive which might be started soon to add new members. As part of its micro-management and micro-planning, the state BJP has made booth the centre of its focus. The party is appointing key functionaries at the booth level besides having a 21-member booth level committee at every booth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-cm-is-panna-pramukh-in-gorakhpur-citys-booth/articleshow/87230538.cms||Neha Shukla

Tanavade said that even if Sisodia comes and addresses press conferences in Goa, there will be no impact on BJP karyakartas as well as people of the state. “AAP is an opposition party and to remain in the limelight they make such statements.” He said that BJP national president J P Nadda and home minister Amit Shah have told the people of Goa what they have to say on leadership. “No political party takes a decision on leadership change three months before the elections. It may be happening in AAP and they must be changing,” he added. Apart from election preparedness, Tanavade said, the central leaders also discussed and finalised various committees for the upcoming elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/aap-party-of-lies-no-leadership-change-in-goa-bjp/articleshow/87230630.cms||Murari Shetye

Special public prosecutor of the court said that the girl, a school dropout, is from a village near Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district. The accused was 27 years old when the incident took place in November 2016. The girl’s parents used to leave the house early in the morning to run their eatery, leaving the minor alone at home. The girl went missing from her house on November 14, 2016, and her parents lodged a complaint with the police. During inquiry the police came to know that she was abducted by the auto driver with the promise of marrying her. “He took her to a lodge in Tirunelveli where they stayed three days, before he took her to Mumbai for a few days and back to his sister’s house in Tirunelveli. He raped her in all these places on multiple occasions,” the special public prosecutor said and added that the case had a few challenges during the trial phase. The case of girl missing registered based on the complaint lodged by her parents was altered to section 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) of the Indian Penal Code and 5(l) (committing penetrative sexual assault on the child repeatedly) read with 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Pocso Act. On completion of the trial, the special court awarded him 20 years imprisonment under the Pocso Act and three years to be served concurrently as he was found guilty under section 366 IPC. A fine of 20,000 was also slapped on him, failing to pay which would result in extension of the jail term by a few months.

Read AlsoTargeted killings focus of Shah meet in Jammu &amp; KashmirSRINAGAR: Union home minister Amit Shah asked officials during a security review in Srinagar on Saturday about the targeted killings of minority community members and migrant labourers despite the heavy security arrangements in Kashmir Valley, official sources said. The killings have spread fearShah said he wants a friendly bond with the youth as they are the future of the nation. He, however, struck a firm note while referring to the change in the status of J&K. “August 5, 2019 will be written in golden letters. It was the end of terrorism, nepotism, corruption... J&K youth has to contribute to the development of the UT. It is their responsibility… The day will come when J&K will contribute a lot to the country.” Shah slammed the political parties in J&K for their criticism of the changes in the constitutional arrangement in August 2019, saying they were upset because of the loss of their political hegemony. “Those who are making a noise are doing so because jamhooriyat (democracy) has come out of the custody of three families and it now belongs to the poor,” Shah said while taking a dig at the Gandhis, Abdullahs and the Syeds. The minister, who addressed members of youth clubs from different regions in J&K via video link, said that contrary to the allegations of the political families, democracy has been broadened under the new dispensation, with the panchayat polls giving youth a share in decision-making. “With the introduction of the three-tier panchayat system, the youth of J&K have the biggest opportunity, only the youth of the village can become panch, sarpanch and district panchayat members. They can also become MLAs and MPs, even CM.” “What did 70 years of jamhooriyat give, 87 MLAs, six MPs and three families? Prime Minister Modi has ensured the election of 30,000 representatives in such a short time,” he said. Shah, who also inaugurated a flight between Srinagar and Sharjah over a video link, justified the suspension of the internet, curbs on mobile telephony and long spells of curfew in the wake of the nullification of Article 370 and the elimination of Article 35A, saying they helped save the lives of thousands of youth. He said that those who questioned the curfew and communications blackout “don’t know how many lives would have been lost”. “The decision was questioned on so many platforms but they helped save lives,” he said as he reiterated the promise to restore statehood after the delimitation exercise was completed and elections held. He debunked the view that the end of J&K’s special status would give a fillip to terrorism, something that has gained currency in certain quarters after the targeting of outsiders, non-Muslim locals, police personnel and BJP workers. “Some people claimed that terrorism will increase. The fact is that it has come down and stone-pelting is not to be seen anywhere,” he said, ruling out a repeat of the situation in the 1990s when terrorism was rampant. “We will deal strictly with those who want to disturb the peace of J&K,” he said. Shah claimed that the youth have responded well to initiatives taken after the Modi government took charge of the UT. “The youth of Kashmir, who until two-and-a half years ago would be in the news only because of stone-pelting, terrorism and violence, are talking about development, employment and educational scholarships,” Shah said, contrasting the situation in Kashmir with that prevalent in PoK. “No other state has such an attractive industrial policy and that is why Rs 12,000 crore investment has come in after the new policy was rolled out. This when the state had got a total Rs 5,000 crore in the seven decades since Independence. I am sure that by 2022 the state will cross the Rs 50,000-crore mark,” he said. Shah said that three families had ruled J&K for 70 years. “Why were 40,000 people killed during their reign? Is there any explanation to those killings,” Shah asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/join-fight-against-terror-amit-shah-urges-jammu-and-kashmir-youth/articleshow/87230695.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Mumbai’s local trains, too, are part of the city’s history and are considered the lifeline of the city. Well, now you can immerse yourself in Mumbai’s rail-gaddi experience, without chugging along from one station to the next. Mumbaikars can hop onto a train at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) for a relaxed meal, a dinner date or a fine-dining experience. The city now has a train-restaurant, which like its name, is an actual train bogie converted into a restaurant. It is quaint, promises a new kind of fine-dine and takes the term ‘meals on wheels’ to a new level. We hopped aboard and tucked into the experience… Docked near platform 18 at CSMT, the restaurant faces a beautiful heritage gullyThe restaurant is located at Heritage Gully, opposite platform 18, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj TerminusThe ‘restaurant on wheels’ as it’s called, was launched a few days ago. It’s nestled in an ideal docking station, too. The restaurant coach mounted on rails is located at the Heritage Gully, opposite platform no 18, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The bright yellow train is hard to miss and has a bunch of emblems on it that are all things Mumbai — from the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Gateway of India, Taj Mahal Palace and more. And guess what, you can walk-in 24X7! Shivaji Sutar, Chief PRO, Central Railway, says, “This the first-of-its-kind of restaurant in Mumbai at CSMT and we look forward to Mumbaikars enjoying the experience of dining in a rail coach. The Railways had come with this concept initially in the Eastern Railway Zone at Asansol, West Bengal. We got a huge response and thought why not use these discarded bogies and convert them into a restaurant on wheels. We also had ample space near platform 18, which has a beautiful heritage gully — with old locomotive wagons, printing press, etc. So, people can have a meal at the restaurant and take a look at all this too.” He adds, “The plan is to have more of these restaurants in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region region — Mumbai and its surrounding area. Locations have been identified at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Nerul and two more near the ghat section and at Igatpuri.” Dabbawalas to kaali-peelis are a part of the decorThe decor of the restaurant includes all the elements that Mumbai is known forThe restaurant has a varied menu from Maharashtrian to South Indian, Chinese and Punjabi as well as missal, vada pao from a takeaway section. Sharing details about the train restaurant, co-manager Sandip Khandare, said, “We hired a designer and got the fans and chairs to give it the authentic look of a railway carriage. There’s trivia on the wall that was given to us by the Railways as well as motif of a dabbawala, food stalls and kaali-peelis — all the elements that Mumbai is known for.” For now, the restaurant is one bogie and accommodates 40 people. Adah Sharma checks out the menu'Commando' actress Adah Sharma, who dropped by the restaurant, totally loved the place. “A train restaurant adds such a fun element to eating out. I loved the idea. This experience made me feel like I’m Raj to my own Simran,” she said. ‘This place could evoke nostalgia’For those who love history, the idea is charming. Deepak Rao, Mumbai-based historian and researcher, shares, “Trains and dining have always had an attachment with Mumbaikars — for my group of friends, travelling to Pune in that morning group on the train and having baked beans on toast and sandwiches, was staple. If you see the history of railways, they had a restaurant at CSMT way back in the 1940s-50s called Brandon’s. It could be a novel idea to have such a train restaurant as nightlife slowly opens and people step out; we have to see how it works.” Food writer Kalyan Karmakar, adds, “I remember going to a train carriage-themed restaurant in Delhi in the early ’90s and found it most exciting. What’s more wonderful in this case is that actual bogies have been used. A lot of the fine-dine audience today doesn’t travel that frequently by trains, so this could evoke nostalgia. An added advantage is that it will draw people to CSMT and help showcase its architectural magnificence.” About the restaurant The restaurant coach mounted on rails is located at the Heritage Gully, opposite platform no 18, CSMT. It has been made using a discarded rail coach. It can accommodate 40 patrons inside the coach with 10 tables. What’s coming up...Railways has plans to explore the possibility of opening similar restaurants at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Kalyan, Nerul, Lonavala and Igatpuri.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ready-for-a-lavish-meal-on-a-train-in-mumbai/articleshow/87230528.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||India||Good judicial infrastructure has always been an afterthought, says CJI||NEW DELHI: Holding that financial autonomy and adequate infrastructure for the judiciary are essential to make the system more effective, Chief Justice N V Ramana on Saturday urged the Centre to clear his proposal to set up a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority, a statutory body that will take care of the needs of the judiciary. The CJI, who was inaugurating the annexe buildings for the Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench, said the present system of “ad-hoc and unplanned” manner of dealing with the judiciary’s infrastructural needs has to be done away with. He buttressed his pitch by saying that an effective and efficient judiciary could also “aid” in the effective growth of the economy and also in attracting foreign investment, as well as that a state-of-the-art judicial infrastructure will mark the “best gift” to the people at the time of the build-up to the 75th anniversary celebrations of independence. “Good judicial infrastructure for courts in India has always been an afterthought. It is because of this mindset that courts in India still operate from dilapidated structures, making it difficult to effectively perform their functions. Judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice and meet the growing demands of the public that is more aware of its rights and is developing economically, socially, and culturally. It is baffling to note that the improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is still being carried out in an ad-hoc, unplanned manner,” he said. The CJI said courts are hamstrung by constraints of insufficient infrastructure as there are 20,143 court halls (including 620 rented ) for 24,280 judicial officers. Only 5% of court complexes have medical facilities and 73% of court rooms have no video-conferencing facility. “If we want a different outcome from the judicial system, we can’t continue to work in these circumstances. An integral aspect, in this regard, is the financial autonomy of the judiciary. I have, therefore, sent a proposal for the establishment of the National Judicial Infrastructure Authority to the ministry of law and justice, and I am hoping for a positive response soon. I urge the minister of law and justice to expedite the process and ensure that the proposal to create the National Judicial Infrastructure Authority with statutory backing is taken up in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament,” he said. The CJI said institutionalising the mechanism for augmenting and creating state-of-the-art judicial infrastructure is the best gift that we can think of giving to our people and our country in this 75th year of our Independence. Pointing out that it took almost a decade to complete the buildings, he said, “This is not the fault of any institution or organ of the state but is emblematic of a deeper structural problem that has plagued judicial infrastructure development in our country since independence.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/good-judicial-infrastructure-has-always-been-an-afterthought-says-cji/articleshow/87230992.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Plan to split Pakistan began in 1965: Senior Navy officer||BENGALURU: Vice-Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla, flag officer commanding-in-chief, Southern Naval Command, said here on Saturday that India had begun thinking of separating East Pakistan from West Pakistan from 1965 though it actually happened in 1971. Chawla’s remarks came at a conclave at Air Force Station Yelahanka celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1971 India-Pakistan war victory. Quoting “declassified” documents that he said were enough to show this, Chawla said: “The thinking started actively after the 1965 war, of how to separate East Pakistan from West. The principal reason was ISI’s interference in northeast insurgencies, particularly arming and training of Naga rebels in the Chittagong hill tracts. We used those lessons when we trained the Mukthi Bahini.” However, he said, India was weak then as Congress had split and Indira Gandhi had barely held on to become prime minister. “She was called ‘Goongi Gudia’ by the opposition, which didn’t expect her to last long,” he said, adding that in Pakistan Yahya Khan had taken over from Tikka Khan in 1969. “He (Yahya) actually started this whole story by dissolving the “one unit geopolitical programme” of 1954, by which entire Pakistan was considered one wing to offset the population superiority of East Pakistan, and called for elections in 1970,” Chawla said. Pointing out that the 1970 elections were the first one-person, one-vote elections in Pakistan, he said Indira Gandhi called for elections one-and-a-half years ahead of the scheduled February 1971 polls. “Yahya was very firmly entrenched and Gandhi was on a weak wicket. It suddenly changed in December 1970 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman won 160 seats in East Pakistan and Bhutto only 81 in West Pakistan. Rahman was the natural successor to the prime ministership,” he said. Stating that the thinking in 1965 was nascent, Chawla inferred that the January 30, 1971 hijacking of an Indian Airlines aircraft to Lahore by Kashmiri separatists may have been a trigger. “The government of India stopped overflight facilities, preventing them from rearming in East Pakistan. They had to fly over Colombo, which was difficult and expensive. Also, Rahman winning elections and not being allowed to be PM started unravelling the whole plot. In March, once Rahman declared independence, India entered the war in April 1971,” Chawla said. He added that the comprehensive Indian response included clandestine operations to sabotage shipping in East Pakistan. “It was not just inter-service collaboration, it was the entire government approach under astute leadership. On March 7, Indira Gandhi won a landslide victory that strengthened her position. Several things fell into place and she came to be called the ‘Durga of India’,” he said. “While we go over individual battles, the most important thing is the immutable principles of war, which almost perfectly followed in 1971. Whether this is being done today or not is for us to judge, but the adversaries are different. Warfare is different and technology has changed everything. We need to look ahead and remember that adversaries, the geopolitical situation, and technology are evolving at an ever faster pace," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plan-to-split-pakistan-began-in-1965-senior-navy-officer/articleshow/87231042.cms||---

Bengal reported 974 fresh cases of the virus on Saturday, the highest single-day count in the state in over three months since July 10 this year. The daily case count in Bengal has been over 800 in the past four days. The other two states witnessing a rise in cases this week are Assam and Himachal Pradesh.

Niti Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul warned that “theIndia on Saturday recorded 15,918 fresh Covid-19 cases, with data from Manipur and Jharkhand not available till late at night. In Bengal, there has been a clear spike in infections this week. In the last seven days, the state has detected 5,560 fresh cases, a 28.4% rise over the previous seven days (4,329). This percentage rise could be an exaggeration since detection of cases was hit during the Durga Puja festival last week.

AY.4.2 is suspected to be the cause for the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the UK, Russia (a lockdown will start in Moscow next week) and Israel in the last week. Scientists say the AY.4.2-related findings still carry a high level of uncertainty, and it is still early to say that this lineage carries higher risk of severe illness and/or death.  On October 21, the US Centers for Diseases Control said it has less than 10 reported case of AY.4.2 in its database so far, but the UK health authorities have found 15,120 cases of VUI-21OCT-01— the other name for AY.4.2 — since it was first detected in July. When contacted, Dr Anurag Agrawal, director at CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said, “AY.4.2 is present in India based on the revised definition, but at very low numbers, less than 0.1%.” IGIB is one of the main laboratories involved in the INSACOG genomic surveillance exercise. Dr Agrawal said further details and exact number of AY.4.2 in India would be available soon. AY.4.2 is a descendant of Delta variant, which has so far been considered the most dangerous form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-contagious-mutant-present-in-low-numbers/articleshow/87231178.cms||Malathy Iyer

It tweeted that Jeffrey Feltman, special envoy for the Horn of Africa, had also urged all sides to recommit to working together to implement Sudan's constitutional declaration, signed after a 2018-2019 uprising that resulted in the removal of then president Omar al-Bashir.  Feltman met with Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sovereign Council, and his deputy General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.  Tensions between the civilian and military leaders who now share power have soared in the wake of an attempted military coup in September, which the army said it had foiled.  As an economic crisis deepens, a coalition of rebel groups and political parties have aligned themselves with the military, which has accused the civilian governing parties of mismanagement and monopolising power, and are seeking to dissolve the cabinet.  In response, hundreds of thousands demonstrated in several parts of the Khartoum and other cities on Thursday against the prospect of military rule. Several cabinet ministers took part.  In a statement after the meeting with Feltman, Burhan praised American support for Sudan's transition to democracy and said the military was keen to protect that transition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/us-envoy-meets-sudanese-leaders-to-reaffirm-support-for-democracy/articleshow/87231197.cms||---

The Indian Academy of Pediatric Surgeons (IAPS), that had long deliberations with insurance companies and finally made a breakthrough with at least one private company — Star Health and Allied Insurance company which agreed to provide the cover — is in discussion with many other insurance providers, officials said. “Many insurance companies do not offer cover for birth defects or surgical problems during infancy. This is a major cost burden for many families and parents who have just recently commenced their jobs and are not having the financial liberty to get their child treated at hospitals of their choice,” IAPS president Dr Ravindra Ramadwar said. Around 1.7 million children are born with birth defects every year. While most insurance companies do not provide such cover, families are often distressed due to high cost of treatment. In the absence of adequate insurance cover for such children, many couples opt for abortion of their child who has been diagnosed to have even the smallest congenital malformation in the antenatal sonography. Dr S Prakash, MD of Star Health said during an online conference on pediatric surgery that the company is passionate in its responsibilities towards these small babies and it has rolled out a new policy where a couple who has enrolled with them for two years would be entitled to get insurance for any birth defect that their child is born with. The company has finished all its formalities and is awaiting an IRDA nod before it can roll out this policy for the benefit of the common public in the next few weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/soon-unborn-child-can-be-insured-for-birth-defects/articleshow/87231205.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||Israel says US knew about outlawing Palestinian civil groups||JERUSALEM: Israel said Saturday the United States had been informed in advance on its decision to designate six Palestinian civil society groups as "terrorist organisations", after criticism from the State Department.  The Israeli defence ministry had on Friday made public its move to effectively outlaw the six prominent Palestinian civil society groups over alleged ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a group blacklisted by several Western governments.  The decision was swiftly condemned by the Palestinian Authority and international human rights groups, with the US saying it would be "engaging our Israeli partners for more information" regarding the basis for these designations.  "The Israeli government did not give us advance warning" that the groups would be designated, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Friday.  But an official in the Israeli defence ministry said Saturday that "officials in the US administration were updated ahead of time," and "some intelligence was shared on the subject."  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reiterated the ties between the six groups and the PFLP, including "forging documents for the purpose of raising donations" for the leftist militant group, which pioneered plane hijackings in the 1970s.  The six groups also "facilitated the recruitment of activists to the military arm of the PFLP," the official said, essentially constituting a "lifeline for the PFLP in the form of fundraising, money laundering and recruitment of activists."  The ministry named the groups as the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees (UPWC), Addameer, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Al-Haq, Defense for Children International - Palestine (DCI-P) and the Union Of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC).  In May, Israeli officials had informed European donors of their alleged financial misconduct, which took place parallel to their legitimate work, and allegedly saw millions of euros funnelled to PFLP militant activities.  Shawan Jabarin, head of Al-Haq, said the Israeli move was the part of long-term campaign "targeting Palestinian institutions in order to silence and frighten them."  "We are a professional organisation, a human rights organisation, with 42 years of field work," he told AFP on Saturday.  Jabarin claimed Israel couldn't handle the legal challenges Al-Haq posed, and was therefore "challenging us in the field by killing, bombing, lockdowns and destruction".  "We expect the countries that officially support us to take a clear position," he said. "It is time for a serious and strong stand against (Israel), which does not recognise international law and does not abide by humanitarian rules."  The Israeli move was also condemned Saturday by dozens of Israel-based rights groups advocating for Palestinian rights.  The so-called "Palestinian Civil society organisations in Israel" said the move was aimed at "intimidating" donors, claiming "misleading information" was behind the decision.  Meanwhile, in a separate development, some 30 employees of international NGOs, including eight new group heads, were stuck abroad awaiting permits to enter Israel, AFP has learned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-says-us-knew-about-outlawing-palestinian-civil-groups/articleshow/87231484.cms||---
---||World||Israel says US knew about outlawing Palestinian civil groups||JERUSALEM: Israel said Saturday the United States had been informed in advance on its decision to designate six Palestinian civil society groups as "terrorist organisations", after criticism from the State Department.  The Israeli defence ministry had on Friday made public its move to effectively outlaw the six prominent Palestinian civil society groups over alleged ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a group blacklisted by several Western governments.  The decision was swiftly condemned by the Palestinian Authority and international human rights groups, with the US saying it would be "engaging our Israeli partners for more information" regarding the basis for these designations.  "The Israeli government did not give us advance warning" that the groups would be designated, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Friday.  But an official in the Israeli defence ministry said Saturday that "officials in the US administration were updated ahead of time," and "some intelligence was shared on the subject."  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, reiterated the ties between the six groups and the PFLP, including "forging documents for the purpose of raising donations" for the leftist militant group, which pioneered plane hijackings in the 1970s.

---||World||Director 'gutted' by death of cinematographer in accidental shooting||SANTA FE: Movie-director Joel Souza, who was shot at and injured in an on-set accident involving actor Alec Baldwin, said on Saturday he was "gutted" by the death of the cinematographer. Souza, who was hit in the shoulder when Baldwin discharged a prop gun containing live rounds, broke his silence as the investigation entered its third day, with multiple questions remaining over how the mistake happened.  "I am gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague, Halyna. She was kind, vibrant, incredibly talented, fought for every inch and always pushed me to be better," Souza said in a statement.  The shot hit cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in the chest, according to the Santa Fe county sheriff's office. She died of her wounds and Souza, who was behind her, was injured but later released from the hospital.  Souza did not give details of the accident or his injuries but said he was "humbled and grateful by the outpouring of affection we have received from our filmmaking community, the people of Santa Fe, and the hundreds of strangers who have reached out".  On Friday, a Santa Fe judge approved a warrant for the sheriff's office to seize firearms, clothing, cameras, video tapes and ammunition from the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe, where Baldwin was filming the low-budget Western "Rust".  Security guards were posted at the road leading to the ranch on Saturday.  According to an affidavit filed by a sheriff's office detective, Baldwin was handed what he believed was a safe or "cold" prop gun during a rehearsal on Thursday, but it contained live rounds when it was fired.  No charges have been filed in the case.  The crew member, or armorer, who handled weapons on the set was identified by the United States media as a 24-year-old woman who spoke on a podcast earlier this year about learning the job from her veteran father but who only recently worked on her first film as head armorer. The woman could not be reached for comment on Saturday.  The International Cinematographers Guild planned to hold a candlelight vigil for Hutchins, 42, on Saturday evening in Albuquerque, about 40 miles (64 km) from the ranch. A second vigil was scheduled for Sunday in the Los Angeles area.  "Halyna inspired us all with her passion and vision, and her legacy is too meaningful to encapsulate in words. Our loss is enormous," her husband Matt Hutchins wrote on Twitter.  The American Film Institute set up a scholarship fund for female cinematographers in Hutchins' honour.  Baldwin, 63, best known for his roles in TV comedy "30 Rock" and his "Saturday Night Live" impersonations of former US president Donald Trump, said on Friday he was shocked and heartbroken at Hutchins' death and was fully cooperating with authorities.  According to multiple media reports and accounts on social media, some of the crew on "Rust" had walked off the job citing concerns about safety prior to Thursday's shooting.  "We cited everything from lack of payment for three weeks, taking our hotels away despite asking for them in our deals, lack of Covid safety and on top of that, poor gun safety! Poor on-set safety period!" one camera crew member wrote on a private Facebook page, according to Hollywood publication Deadline.com  Rust Movie Productions said in a statement on Friday it was investigating the incident.  "Though we were not made aware of any official complaints concerning weapon or prop safety on set, we will be conducting an internal review of our procedures while production is shut down," the company said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/director-gutted-by-death-of-cinematographer-in-accidental-shooting/articleshow/87231248.cms||---
---||World||Film crew voiced complaints before fatal on-set shooting||SANTA FE: The tragic incident, in which actor Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set on Thursday with a gun, he was told to be safe, took place hours and days after some workers walked off the job to protest safety conditions and other production issues. An assistant director, Dave Halls, grabbed a prop gun off a cart at a desert movie ranch and handed it to Baldwin during a Thursday rehearsal for the Western film "Rust", according to court records made public Friday. "Cold gun", Halls yelled, declaring the weapon didn't carry live ammunition and was ready to fire. But it wasn't. When Baldwin pulled the trigger, he unwittingly killed 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza who was standing behind her inside a wooden, chapel-like building. A 911 call that alerted authorities to the shooting at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe hints at the panic on the movie set, as detailed in a recording released by the Santa Fe County Regional Emergency Communications Center. "We had two people accidentally shot at on a move set by a prop gun, we need help immediately," script supervisor Mamie Mitchell told an emergency dispatcher. "We were rehearsing and it went off, and I ran out, we all ran out." The dispatcher asked if the gun was loaded with a real bullet. "I cannot tell you. We have two injuries," Mitchell replied. "And this (expletive) AD (assistant director) that yelled at me at lunch, asking about revisions... He's supposed to check the guns. He's responsible for what happens on the set." Halls did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. The Associated Press was unable to contact Hannah Gutierrez, the film's armorer, and several messages sent to production companies affiliated with "Rust" did not receive responses Friday. The gun Baldwin used was one of three that Gutierrez had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being rehearsed, according to the court records. Halls grabbed the firearm from the cart and brought it inside to the actor, unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in a search warrant application. It was unclear how many rounds were fired. Gutierrez removed a shell casing from the gun after the shooting, and she turned the weapon over to police when they arrived, the court records say. Guns used in making movies are sometimes real weapons that can fire either bullets or blanks, which are gunpowder charges that produce a flash and a bang but no dangerous projectile. Mitchell, the script supervisor, told The Associated Press she was standing next to Hutchins when the cinematographer was hit. "I ran out and called 911 and said Bring everybody, send everybody,' " Mitchell said. "This woman is gone at the beginning of her career. She was an extraordinary, rare, very rare woman." Filmmaker Souza, who was shot in the shoulder, said in a statement to NBC News that he was grateful for the support he was receiving and gutted by the loss of Hutchins. "She was kind, vibrant, incredibly talented, fought for every inch and always pushed me to be better," he said. Santa Fe-area District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said prosecutors are reviewing evidence in the shooting and do not know if charges will be filed. Baldwin, 63, who is known for his roles in "30 Rock" and "The Hunt for Red October" and his impression of former President Donald Trump on "Saturday Night Live," has described the killing as a "tragic accident." He was a producer of "Rust." "There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours. I'm fully cooperating with the police investigation," Baldwin wrote on Twitter. "My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna." Production on "Rust" was halted after the shooting. The movie is about a 13-year-old boy who is left to fend for himself and his younger brother following the death of their parents in 1880s Kansas, according to the Internet Movie Database website. Before the fateful rehearsal, there were signs of problems on the set. Seven crew members walked off several hours before Hutchins was killed to express their discontent with matters that ranged from safety conditions to their accommodations, according to one of the crew members who left. The disputes began soon after filming began in early October, said the crew member, who requested anonymity because he feared speaking up would hurt his prospects for future jobs. The crew was initially housed at the Courtyard Marriot in Santa Fe, according to the crew member. Four days in, however, they were told that going forward they would be housed at the budget Coyote South hotel. Some crew members balked at staying there. The Los Angeles Times and Variety also reported on the walkout. Rust Movie Productions did not answer emails Friday and Saturday seeking comment. There were other concerns. Only minimal COVID-19 precautions were taken even though crew and cast members often worked in small enclosed spaces on the ranch, the crew member who spoke to the AP said. He said he never witnessed any formal orientation about weapons used on set, which normally would take place before filming begins. A combination of those concerns prompted the seven to walk off the job. "We packed our gear and left that morning," the crew member said of the Thursday walkout.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/film-crew-voiced-complaints-before-fatal-on-set-shooting/articleshow/87231254.cms||---
---||World||Inquiry into Baldwin shooting focusses on custody of gun||LOS ANGELES: The police investigation into a fatal shooting with a prop gun fired by actor Alec Baldwin on a film set was focussing Saturday on the specialist in charge of the weapon and the assistant director who handed it to Baldwin.  Ukraine-born cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, was struck in the chest and died shortly after the incident Thursday in New Mexico, while director Joel Souza, 48, who was standing behind her as they lined up a shot, was wounded and hospitalised, then released.  Police interviewed a visibly distraught Baldwin who willingly cooperated, but have pressed no charges.  The incident stunned many in Hollywood and beyond, sparking intense speculation about how such an accident, on the set of a 19th-century Western called "Rust", could have occurred despite elaborate gun-safety protocols for film sets.  The gun, which was supposed to be loaded with a blank charge, instead had a live round, according to the affidavit submitted by the Santa Fe County sheriff's office to obtain a search warrant. The affidavit was viewed by AFP.  It said that Assistant Director Dave Halls, identified as the man who handed the gun to Baldwin during a rehearsal, called out "cold gun" as he did so -- industry code to indicate the weapon had only a blank charge.  "The assistant director (Dave Halls) did not know live rounds were in the prop-gun" when he gave it to Baldwin, the affidavit said.  It said police wanted to determine whether any video footage or cell phone images would shed light on the incident; to check the "Western style" outfit worn by Baldwin, which bore apparent blood stains; and to check all firearms, ammunition and casings on the scene.  It said that Baldwin handed the gun to 24-year-old Hannah Gutierrez-Reed -- the movie's weapons master, or armorer -- immediately after the shooting, and that she removed a spent casing and handed both to deputies when they arrived.  A 911 call to police immediately afterward conveyed the shock and anger felt on the set.  "We've had two people accidentally shot by a prop gun; we need help immediately," the caller told a police dispatcher.  "Was it loaded with a real bullet," the dispatcher asks.  "I don't -- I can't tell you that," the caller replied. "And this (expletive) AD... this mother (expletive) -- he's supposed to check the guns, he's responsible for what happens on the set."  Detailed gun safety guidelines from the Actors' Equity Association group specify that "all loading of firearms must be done by the property master, armourer or experienced persons working under their direct supervision".  The guidelines also state: "Before each use, make sure the gun has been test-fired off stage and then ask to test fire it yourself. Watch the prop master check the cylinders and barrel to be sure no foreign object or dummy bullet has become lodged inside."  Baldwin, one of Hollywood's best-known actors, has said he was cooperating fully with the inquiry. He retweeted a story from trade journal Variety headlined "Alec Baldwin Was Told Prop Gun Was Safe Before Fatal Shooting, Affidavit Says."  Gutierrez-Reed is the daughter of longtime film-industry armourer Thell Reed.  In a September podcast, she said she had some trepidation about serving as lead armourer for the first time for the previous movie she worked on, "The Old Way", another Western, starring Nicolas Cage.  "I almost didn't take the job cause I wasn't sure if I was ready," she said on the "Voices of the West" podcast. Loading blanks, she added, made her particularly nervous.  Halls and Gutierrez-Reed could not immediately be reached for comment.  District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said in a statement Friday that the case is in its preliminary stages, adding, "At this time, we do not know if charges will be filed."  The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported that there had been at least three prop gun misfires prior to the fatal accident, and some crew members had protested that and other working conditions.  It said at least one camera operator had messaged a production manager, saying, "We've now had 3 accidental discharges. This is super unsafe."  Rust Movie Productions said in a statement that it had not been made aware of any "official complaints" but would "continue to cooperate with the Santa Fe authorities".  It said it was also conducting an internal review.  "Rust," for which Baldwin is a co-producer, was being filmed in the foothills of northern New Mexico on sprawling Bonanza Creek Ranch, which has been used as the setting for scores of movies.  Baldwin stars as Harland Rust, an outlaw who goes on the run with his grandson after the latter is convicted of murder following an accidental killing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inquiry-into-baldwin-shooting-focusses-on-custody-of-gun/articleshow/87231288.cms||---

The exchange of barbs started after Mustafa, a former Punjab DGP who also has personal ties with Amarinder, hit out at former CM in two tweets. In the second tweet, he posted a photo of Alam with Dinkar Gupta and Vini Mahajaan, the husband-wife duo who were the Punjab DGP and chief secretary when Amarinder was CM. In the first tweet, Mustafa took a jibe at Amarinder, who had said on Friday that Alam’s visit had been cleared to India by the MEA, RAW and IB. “Please do understand, grant of visa by UPA or NDA doesn’t include licence to domesticate and outsource governance apparatus to videshi mehman (foreign guest) with unfettered liberty to loot and launder,” he wrote. Mustafa questioned the logic behind Thukral tweeting a photo of Alam with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. In reply to Mustafa, Thukral posted more pictures: this time of Alam with Mustafa’s wife, who is Punjab minister Razia Sultana, and daughter-in-law. “Even during bitter fights, we draw a line, Raveen bhai; no self-appointed surrogate would ever understand that,” Mustafa wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aides-of-captain-amarinder-sidhu-in-twitter-war-over-ex-cms-pakistan-friend/articleshow/87231302.cms||---
---||India||Targeted killings focus of Shah meet in Jammu & Kashmir||SRINAGAR: Union home minister Amit Shah asked officials during a security review in Srinagar on Saturday about the targeted killings of minority community members and migrant labourers despite the heavy security arrangements in Kashmir Valley, official sources said. The killings have spread fear among these communities and have led to an exodus of migrant labour back to Bihar. Shah, on his first visit to the region since the August 5, 2019 nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution, asked the security and intelligence agencies to work in tandem to give a final push to end militancy in J&K. The security review meeting at Raj Bhavan here lasted nearly five hours and was attended by the Indian security apparatus brass, including the intelligence chief, BSF chief, CRPF DG, J&K police chief and other senior officials. Read AlsoJoin fight against terror, Amit Shah urges Jammu and Kashmir youthHome minister Amit Shah reached out to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday, asking them to join the fight against terrorism and take advantage of the opportunities that have opened up because of the Modi government’s development push.Shah also received a detailed briefing about the recent killings, radicalisation, recruitment and infiltration, and about anti-militancy operations. On arriving in Srinagar on Saturday, Shah was driven directly to the home of the family of Jammu & Kashmir police inspector Parvez Ahmad, who was shot dead by militants in June this year. Shah met his widow, Fatima, and handed her an order giving her a government job on compassionate grounds. Ahmad was posted in the Jammu & Kashmir police’s CID wing and was killed outside his house in Nowgam on June 22. Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, junior minister in the PMO Jitendra Singh, and J&K DGP Dilbag Singh accompanied the Union home minister on his visit. Security was tightened across Kashmir ahead of Shah’s visit. In Srinagar, a security blanket has been thrown across the city to ensure that his visit passes peacefully. While patrolling and frisking were intensified the last few days, drones were being used for aerial surveillance. Additional forces have been deployed across the city and new bunkers have come up in vulnerable areas. Security around areas with minority populations has also increased and sharpshooters have been deployed at vantage points in many parts of the city, police said on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/targeted-killings-focus-of-shah-meet-in-jammu-kashmir/articleshow/87231333.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Indo-Bangla ties deeper than any strategic alliance: Shringla||BENGALURU: Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Saturday said the ties between India and Bangladesh were deeper than any other strategic partnership, and that it was a role model for nations that share borders. Shringla, who was scheduled to speak at the conclave celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1971 Indo-Pak war victory at the Air Force station-Yelahanka here, shared a virtual video statement, in which he said, “India-Bangladesh relations have matured over the years and the two pillars of Indian diplomacy — ‘Neighbourhood First’ and ‘Act East’ — find expression in our vibrant ties with Bangladesh.” Quoting PM Narendra Modi, Shringla said 2021 marks the triveni of events that have epochal significance — the golden jubilee of the liberation of Bangladesh; the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties. “The fact that Modi’s first foreign visit since the pandemic was to Dhaka at the invitation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to commemorate the golden jubilee is testimony to the highest priorities the countries attach to the relationship,” he said. He added that India and Bangladesh today share a Sonali Adhyay, or golden chapter, in a relationship geared towards bringing stability and prosperity to people on both sides. Bangladesh’s decision to establish a memorial in remembrance of the sacrifices made by members of the Indian armed forces in 1971, he said, was a key step towards preserving this history of shared sacrifice. “India-Bangladesh relations today, in many ways, are a continuation of the events that defined the course of history 50 years ago,” he said. Recollecting the events from 50 years ago, he said it was as much a moral and political victory, as it was a decisive military victory. “1971 was a war for justice over crude tyranny, a quest for hope in the midst of despair, and a catharsis achieved through dharma yudh,” he said. He said never before in the recent history of our region has humanity ever witnessed an act of calculated genocide.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indo-bangla-ties-deeper-than-any-strategic-alliance-shringla/articleshow/87231388.cms||---

Though the Motor Transport Workers Act of 1961 specifies that no driver will be behind the wheels for more than eight hours in any day and 48 hours in any week, this rule is hardly enforced barring a few very big players in the transport sector. The Committee on Estimates has recommended that “driving hours of drivers be regulated by introducing a login and logout system for driving and driving hours per day be restricted to a specific number of hours beyond which the system may not permit the driver to drive.” Officials admitted that the solution to this lies in technology rather than physical enforcement. “Devices can be installed on vehicles that can read the finger impression of the respective driver and the ignition and complete stop can be automatically linked to the total driving hours. There is technology, but this needs adoption by all transporters and vehicle owners,” said an official. Recently, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had also directed officials to frame a policy for fixing the “driving hours” for commercial drivers on the lines of pilots while taking note of driver fatigue resulting in fatal road crashes. He had also instructed the officials to work on a plan to include On-Board Sleep Detection Sensors in commercial vehicles at par with European standards. It has flagged the long driving hours as one of the reasons for fatal crashes on Indian roads. In its latest report, the panel said while high quality roads are being developed in the country the highways and expressways have become infamous for frequent fatal crashes. “Causes of such fatal accidents are speeding, drunk driving, lack of lane discipline amongst the commuters, drivers falling asleep due to excessive driving hours, faulty road design and black spots,” it has observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/log-in-log-out-system-needed-for-drivers-says-house-panel/articleshow/87231398.cms||Dipak K Dash

He will land at the airport in the afternoon along with his wife Rabri Devi and elder daughter Misa Bharti. During his stay in Bihar, he is likely to hit the byelection campaign trail. Lalu’s arrival ahead of the bypolls in Bihar’s Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur seats is expected to invigorate RJD workers. The two constituencies will go to polls on October 30. Sources said Lalu would address at least one meeting each at Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur. “A final decision regarding the campaign will be taken after Lalu’s arrival,” said a senior RJD functionary. RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tirawi said Lalu’s arrival would enthuse party workers. “Old-timers who have worked with the RJD chief will be happy to see him back,” Tiwari said. Lalu’s arrival will also be a shot in the arm for leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who had to face the wrath of his elder brother Tej Pratap. Tejashwi has been campaigning vigorously against JD(U) and Congress candidates in the two constituencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lalu-prasad-likely-to-hit-campaign-trail/articleshow/87231432.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||India||‘Conscious possession’ not proved, NCB-accused freed||MUMBAI: Upholding an acquittal in an NCB case over an alleged haul of mandrax tablets 30 years ago, the Bombay HC recently held that “confessional statement alleged to have been given by the accused is essentially a weak piece of evidence which doesn’t have any corroboration”, particularly when no proof of ‘conscious possession’ is shown. “Ipse dixitism (dogmatic assertion) of the prosecution witnesses can’t be accepted as a gospel truth,” said the HC bench of Justice Sadhana Jadhav and Justice Prithviraj Chavan on October 12, adding that conviction can’t be based on ‘conjectures and surmises.’ The HC said this after noting that the NCB evidence mostly comprised its officers’ testimonies and that the agency wanted the court to “rely on and accept as a voluntary statement” a statement of the accused recorded on four occasions while in their custody. The case was of an alleged seizure from a tempo in August 1991 at then Bombay Port Trust of seven packets weighing 480 kg containing lungis, and within it hidden the drug Methaqualone (mandrax). A sample of 42 contraband tablets with an ‘M’ and “swastik” mark on either side was taken, weighed and sealed. The lungis were taken separately and packed in cartons. “In order to prove “conscious possession” of the contraband, it is necessary for prosecution to establish direct control of the accused over the article,” said the HC, citing a 2008 judgment. It also said the agency has not shown where the consignment was loaded and which country it was destined for. “It is an unsolved mystery as to who was the real owner of the consignment and what was his name,” said the HC verdict authored by Justice Chavan. The HC also relied on an SC 2002 verdict where it said, “Possession and ownership need not always go together but the minimum requisite element which has to be satisfied is custody or control over the goods.” A resident of Thane was arrested, tried and acquitted in 1996 by a special judge designated under the NDPS Act in Mumbai. The NCB appealed against the judgment. A central excise superintendent had received information about the consignment and had forwarded it in writing to his deputy director for action on August 29, 1991. The NCB officers were called and decided to intercept the tempo when it entered BPT. During the raid, the accused was apprehended. Statements were recorded by NCB the next day and the arrest was made on August 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conscious-possession-not-proved-ncb-accused-freed/articleshow/87231477.cms||Swati Deshpande

The ED has registered an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) into the case, considering a police case registered based on a complaint by one Pappachan Varghese as a predicate offence. Sources said all accused in the police case have also been named in the ECIR. This includes Cardinal George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church. The ED has summoned Pappachan, the complainant, on October 28 to give evidence and a statement. “The case was registered a few weeks ago and the probe is on. All those named in the police case have been added in the ECIR. But this can change once the investigation progresses. The agency is probing whether any financial illegalities like money laundering has occurred in the deals. If any of those named in the police FIR is found to be not involved in such offences, then their names may be omitted at a later stage,” an ED source said. Sources said the ED had made preliminary inquiries into the issue earlier as well. However, the directorate decided to register a case and probe the issue after the Kerala high court on August 12 dismissed a total of seven petitions filed by Cardinal Alencherry to quash the cases related to the controversial land deals. As per a case registered by the central police, based on the complaint by Pappachan, there are 24 accused in the case, including the then finance officer of the archdiocese, Father Joshy Puthuva.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-to-probe-kerala-church-land-deals/articleshow/87231482.cms||---

Wankhede, who is probing the cruise liner drugs seizure case, had on October 11 called on director general of police Sanjay Pandey, saying his movements were being monitored by Oshiwara police during his daily visits to a cemetery where his mother has been buried. In his complaint, Wankhede submitted it had come to his knowledge that two constables from Oshiwara police station, along with unknown persons, had visited the cemetery in the afternoon of October 7 and collected CCTV footage of his visit. Further, Wankhede brought to the notice of the DGP that he had been informed by his sources that a daughter of a senior state cabinet member, NCP’s Nawab Malik, had been trying to gather information about his movements. Subsequently, on October 11, the trustee of the cemetery had informed him that the police officials were asking for DVR (digital video recording) of the cemetery. Wankhede informed the DGP that he had been visiting the cemetery every day before attending office and whenever time permitted, for the past six years. Initially, the trustee conveyed his inability to share the DVR, but as those who were asking were police officials and for the sake of the trust, CCTV footage was provided to them, he said. Wankhede also urged the DGP that the location of the minister’s daughter should be found out from the cell tower.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncb-officials-charge-of-spying-untrue-mumbai-cops/articleshow/87231497.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a forecast of light rainfall and snowfall in the higher reaches of Uttarakhand in the next 24 hours. “Very light to light rain and thundershowers are likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Haridwar, Chamoli, Nainital and Champawat districts on Sunday,” the IMD said, adding that snowfall is likely to occur at isolated places in higher reaches of Uttarkashi and Chamoli. The local Met department attempted to allay fears and said light rainfall is unlikely to cause damage. “There is a prediction of light rain, but no heavy showers are expected,” said an official. A fresh spell of snow in higher reaches, however, is likely to impede rescue operations which had to be halted on Saturday as well. While a search operation in Uttarkashi to trace two missing trekkers on Harsil-Chitkul trek was called off due to bad weather, another operation to airlift bodies of six trekkers who died en route Sunderdhunga glacier in Bageshwar district was also postponed. A search on foot, however, continued. The current death toll from rain-related incidents in the state stood at 72 on Saturday. Nainital, the worst-hit district, has continued to bear the brunt of landslides. On Saturday, a landslide was reported in Baliyanala area on a slope that has recorded recurrent landslides in the recent past. The administration has evacuated 70 families from the area and shifted them to a school. “The remaining 50 families will also be shifted to nearby schools and a dharamshala,” said a district official. Ward member from Baliyanala Rekha Arya said: “The area has faced recurrent landslides since October 17, but we received no help from the administration until now,” she said. Mukhtar Ali, president of Baliyanala Sangharsh Committee, told TOI the area was a vulnerable zone. “Every year, we face the same problem and the administration promises to come up with a long-term solution. We need a permanent solution,” Ali said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fresh-rain-alert-sparks-fear-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/87231635.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Modi stressed the need to ramp up vaccination to be able to cover all eligible population as quickly as possible, while underlining the need to help other countries in inoculating their population. The vaccine manufacturers appreciated the vision and dynamic leadership of PM Modi in providing continuous guidance and support that helped in getting vaccines ready in record time. They also appreciated the collaboration between the government and the industry, and lauded the regulatory reforms, simplified procedures and timely approvals and support from the Centre that ensured smooth delivery of vaccines from lab to land. “The Prime Minister went out of his way, made all regulatory people move very fast, they also cooperated and that is why India is where it is today in covering up such a huge population, which it would have otherwise not been able to do,” said Cyrus Poonawalla, CMD, Serum Institute of India. Modi met seven vaccine manufacturers on Saturday. Apart from Serum Institute of India, representatives from Bharat Biotech, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Zydus Cadila, Biological E, Gennova Biopharma and Panacea Biotech were present at the meeting. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and junior health minister Bharati Pravin Pawar also attended the meeting. The PM said the world is looking up to India, in the backdrop of the success of the vaccination drive. Vaccine manufacturers should continuously work together to be ready to face future challenges, he added. “PM Modi emphasised on how we can create our vaccine Maitri globally and take Brand India to the next level,” Panacea Biotec MD Rajesh Jain said. Bharat Biotech’s Dr Krishna Ella thanked Modi for having taken Covaxin, and for the continuous support during its development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-standardise-pandemic-best-practices-pm-modi-to-vaccine-companies/articleshow/87231257.cms||Sushmi Dey

According to data with the State Operation Emergency Center (SEOC), nearly 300 people have died, 66 have been reported missing and over 100 people sustained injuries in weather-related calamities this year. This includes casualties in events like flash floods or floods, cloudbursts, avalanches, landslides and mudflows. Barring the 2013 deluge, this is the second-highest fatalities count in a year since 2010. While the hill state has had a long history of natural disasters, it was only in 2010 that the data collection system was enhanced. “While data was being maintained earlier as well, flash floods in 2010 prompted the state to bolster its disaster management system and strengthen data collection,” said an official. A total of 220 people had died in natural disasters in 2010. According to the sixth assessment report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, India will see heavier rainfall in the coming decades.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhands-most-disaster-related-deaths-in-2021/articleshow/87231742.cms||Gaurav Talwar

After staying with the dancer as a partner for some time, Mohd Mumtaz escaped with all his earnings from dance performances. On the written complaint of the victim, Gola police on Thursday registered a case against Mumtaz under various sections of IPC, SC/ST Act and Transplantation of Human Organs Act. As per the complaint, the victim was a dancer in Gola Bazar. In June 2020, he met Mumtaz and on the lure of getting more money, went to Delhi with him. In Delhi, Mumtaz allegedly gave some medicines to him in food due to which the dancer fell unconscious. Mumtaz then took him to a hospital, where, after regaining consciousness, he found that his sex has been changed and he has become a woman. Mumtaz then made him perform dances in Delhi and usurped all his earnings. After living in Delhi as a couple for some time, they returned to Gorakhpur. When the dancer went to Mumtaz’s village, he found that Mumtaz was married and had children. When he tried to lodge a police complaint, Mumtaz threatened him. In his complaint, the dancer has mentioned that Mumtaz has gone missing with his wife and children, taking along with him Rs 10 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 4 lakh earned through his dance performances. “We have registered a case against Mumtaz under 18 different sections. A search has been launched to nab the accused,” Gola SHO Dharmendra Kumar told TOI on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saga-of-love-sex-change-and-dhokha/articleshow/87231815.cms||Arjumand Bano

---||World||Obama fires up Virginia crowd for governor's race he calls a US "turning point"||RICHMOND: Former US president Barack Obama urged Virginians to re-elect Terry McAuliffe as governor at a rally on Saturday, emphasising the race's significance as an indicator of the country's political direction and a reflection of its values.  Obama and McAuliffe, who served as the state's governor from 2014 to 2018, spoke before a cheering crowd at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond with just 10 days to go before the closely watched, tight Novemeber 2 election.  The off-year race is seen as a barometer of how the country might decide the 2022 midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress, and a referendum on Democrat Joe Biden's presidency.  Obama told the crowd the Virginia election represented a national "turning point", where Americans could either become more embattled in the divisive politics that characterised Republican Donald Trump's presidency and which culminated in an attack by his supporters on the United States Capitol on January 6, or "pull together" to "solve big problems".  "I believe you, right here in Virginia, are going to show the rest of the country and the world that we're not going to indulge in our worst instincts," Obama said. "We're not going to go back to the chaos that did so much damage. We're going to move forward with people like Terry leading the way." McAuliffe told the crowd the election was too important to sit out, with several key issues on the ballot.  "This election is about the next chapter of Virginia and our country. It's about leading us out of this pandemic, keeping our economy strong, protecting voter rights, protecting abortion rights and so much more," he said.  Opinion polls show McAuliffe, 64, and Republican Glenn Youngkin, 54, nearly tied. A poll this week by Monmouth University showed Youngkin had closed McAuliffe's 5-point lead since September by gaining ground with independent and women voters.  Youngkin's strength in the polls during the first weeks of early voting has worried Democrats who anticipated a comfortable lead in a state that has trended blue in recent years. Democrats flipped the Virginia legislature in 2019 and Trump lost the state by 10 percentage points in November 2020, double his margin of defeat in 2016. Melody Pearce, 50, a clinical nurse investigator who attended Saturday's rally for McAuliffe, said the polls made her nervous.  "After the election of President Biden, I thought we would be able to exhale for a minute," she said. "I'm afraid people will not come out to vote and lose enthusiasm."  Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison told reporters at Saturday's event he was confident that Virginians would go to the polls and deliver a victory for McAuliffe.  "At the end of the day, it's about turnout," he said. "If we get the Democrats to turn out, we win."  The serving governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, cannot seek re-election because the state bars governors from serving consecutive terms. McAuliffe can run because he left office in 2018.  Both candidates for governor have dug into hotly contested cultural issues to stir up voter engagement, including abortion rights and how schools address the topics of race and racism with students.  McAuliffe has sought to paint Youngkin as a far-right extremist and align him with Trump, who has endorsed the Republican candidate.  In turn, Youngkin has suggested that McAuliffe is trying to advance a far-left agenda. A former private equity executive, Youngkin has focused in part on education - especially the right of parents to have a say in their children's schooling - which has proven popular with suburban women, a key demographic.  Youngkin has walked a fine line between welcoming Trump's endorsement and distancing himself from the former president's false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.  Obama condemned Youngkin on Saturday for walking that line, and said it reflected poorly on his character.  "Either he actually believes in the same conspiracy theories that resulted in a mob, or he doesn't believe it but he's willing to go along with it to say or do anything to get elected. And maybe that's worse," Obama said.  Last week, Youngkin dissociated himself from a rally held to support him, which was headlined by longtime Trump aide Steve Bannon and Trump himself, who spoke by phone. At the event, attendees pledged allegiance to a flag that event leaders said was present on Jan. 6 when Trump supporters led an assault on the US Capitol.  Youngkin issued a statement saying it was "weird and wrong" to pledge allegiance to a flag with Jan. 6 connections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obama-fires-up-virginia-crowd-for-governors-race-he-calls-a-us-turning-point/articleshow/87231841.cms||---

The woman called the police helpline after she came to know of the abduction and said the youth’s life was in danger, Vijayapura SP HD Anand Kumar said. Her brother and maternal uncle have been detained. She has been sent to a women’s home since there is a threat to her life, he said. The victim, Ravi Shankreppa Nimbaragi, was reported missing by his family on Friday. Shashidhar filed a complaint saying his elder brother had left home around 6pm on Thursday to buy groceries. “As he did not return by 8pm, I went to search for him and saw his slippers and a cloth bag lying in the fields. I returned home and alerted my mother and elder brother Basavaraj. He called Ravi, but his mobile was phone off,” Shashidhar said. The family finally filed the complaint the next day. The woman called the police helpline on Friday morning to report that her family members had abducted Ravi and his life was in danger. Police teams rushed to the village and detained the woman’s brother and maternal uncle. The duo confessed to the crime, the SP said, and led police to an abandoned well where they said Ravi’s body had been dumped. Ravi was in love with the woman, 24, for the past four-five years, police said. “We have learned that the girl’s parents were embarrassed over their relationship. As the families’ fields are in the same area, arguments broke out often and there was rivalry,” Sindgi circle police inspector HM Patil said. Between Thursday night and Friday, the woman’s family members are believed to have killed Ravi and thrown his body into the well. “We are searching for the body,” Patil said. Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders demanded the arrest of the accused within 24 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/youth-killed-over-interfaith-love-in-karnataka-womans-kin-detained/articleshow/87231846.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

They raised the issue at a police-public interaction chaired by police commissioner Kamal Pant at Vyalikaval station in central division.Cops maintained towing staff have no power to collect fines and such matters should be brought to the notice of the jurisdictional police officials, who shall ensure action.During the interaction, many complained of rough behaviour by the towing staff. “No announcement is made before towing away the vehicles. Often, there is no board indicating whether it is a parking zone or not,” participants said.Sadashivanagar traffic police said the public can get picture evidence for vehicles towed away from their jurisdiction for violating parking norms. “We can send those pictures to vehicle owners on mobile,” they said.Another participant said a towing staffer took Rs 500 from him and let off his two-wheeler but did not issue a receipt. “The actual fine amount you should have paid is Rs 1,150. What you have paid is a bribe. Please don’t encourage such a habit. If you really feel that you have parked your vehicle in the right place, contact senior police officials,” Pant said. Residents of Vyalikaval and surrounding areas demanded installation of more CCTV cameras in their localities. “Under the Safe City project, the city is getting around 7,000 surveillance cameras and 70 places in and around Vyalikaval have been identified for installation,” deputy commissioner of police (central) MN Anuchet said.Some women complained that men were creating nuisance by consuming alcohol by standing outside bars and wine stores. Police said they have already acted against such persons and shall increase patrolling.Student: Why do cops collect money from traders?A second PU student earned appreciation from the public after he drew the commissioner’s attention on the corruption issue. “Beat constables are often seen collecting money from petty traders. I asked the traders why should they hand over the money. They said if money is not given, police will book them for encroaching pavements,” the student said. Pant directed the inspector to answer him. “Please call me on my mobile whenever you come across such incidents again,” inspector Hemanth Kumar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/towing-staff-cant-collect-fines-cops/articleshow/87231939.cms||---

Doctors at the Motherhood Hospital in Indiranagar who conducted the procedure say the woman suffered from a condition called the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome, seen in one among 1 million women. The syndrome affects the reproductive system. The vagina and uterus are either underdeveloped or absent, though secondary sexual characteristics, like breast development, are normal. Women with this syndrome have female chromosomal patterns and have functional ovaries. While they cannot give birth due to the lack of a vagina and a uterus, they can go for assisted reproductive methods. The woman, who was recently married, visited the Bengaluru hospital first on August 24 and underwent thorough consultation. All that the woman and her husband wanted was a normal sexual life, as they were fully aware that she wouldn’t be able to bear children. On August 31, she underwent surgery. Dr Suhasini Inamdar, the consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital said the woman outwardly appeared normal “because she has got functional ovaries. When the woman was a foetus in her mother’s womb, the development of the uterus, cervix and vagina didn’t happen because of the MRKH Syndrome and they remained rudimentary even as she grew up.” Though the woman had normal hormonal development, she had never menstruated, which is typical of women with MRKH Syndrome, the doctor said. Dr Inamdar said that during the initial consultation she had suggested to the couple that they go for surrogacy because the woman’s uterus was underdeveloped, but her ovaries were intact. “Then they told me ‘hum ko bachcha nahin chahiye (we don’t want children)’. They were only looking for a normal sexual life,” the doctor said. The woman’s husband is a physiotherapist. With the advancement in medical technology, the doctors used the tissues from the woman’s peritoneum, the inner lining of the abdomen,and a passage mimicking the vagina was created for the woman, through laparoscopic surgery. Dr Inamdar said this is the second MRKH Syndrome case she has seen in her career spanning more than three decades. “The first such case I had seen was in 1988 when I was doing my post-graduation. At that time, there was no such medical advancement and we had only created a passage for that woman. But when I came across a similar case after over 33 years, we were able to help the woman with the vaginal construction using her own tissues,” she said. Dr Padmini Prasad, president of the Bangalore Society of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, said that women with MRKH Syndrome can have sexual relationships. “If girls don’t have their period even at the age of 16 years, despite having age-appropriate physical development, they must go to gynaecologists. That’s how MRKH cases get detected. With modern medical development, they can be helped with an artificial vagina and can have children through surrogacy,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-doctors-create-vagina-for-bengal-woman-with-rare-syndrome/articleshow/87231940.cms||Sunitha Rao R

SUV owner Srinivasa Naidu TK, a businessman and resident of Saptagiri apartment, has filed a police complaint. Naidu said CCTV footage from the apartment revealed that 5-6 masked men set the vehicle ablaze around 12.40am. Earlier in the night (around 10pm), six men had knocked on his door saying they were from a courier agency and suspecting foul play, Naidu had informed Sadashivanagar police. “Which courier firm agents will visit at 10pm? I saw a few men standing a little away from my door and immediately called police. Hearing my conversation with the cops, they fled. Police personnel in a Hoysala vehicle visited me and searched the vicinity of my house for over one hour, but in vain,” Naidu said Around 12.40am, the businessman heard a loud noise of a tyre explosion. “I stepped out of my flat and ran towards the basement. My Range Rover was on fire. Before we could do anything, the entire vehicle was gutted,” Naidu said, adding: “It was my dream car. I had purchased it from another person in February this year.” CCTV footage showed around six masked men entering the apartment complex and setting the SUV on fire. Asked whether he suspected anyone, Naidu said: “I am still in shock and cannot say anything. I am hopeful of a speedy investigation.” An investigating officer said: “It seems like a rivalry-related issue. We have some clues about the suspects.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bizmans-high-end-suv-set-on-fire-in-apartment-parking/articleshow/87231941.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Accident cases: Complaint delay can help in deciding genuineness, says Karnataka High Court||Bengaluru: A mere delay in filing a road accident complaint would not make the claimant ineligible for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the Karnataka High Court has said, but added that it plays an important role in ascertaining the genuineness of the claim. The court’s observation came in a case in which it upheld the order of a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Vijayapura, dismissing a plea seeking Rs 22 lakh compensation in an accident case. A 74-year-old retired teacher and agriculturist, Jagannath, had approached the high court, claiming that he had suffered multiple injuries when a motorcycle allegedly hit him from behind while he was riding pillion on his son’s bike in Shivangi village, Vijayapura district, around 10.10 am on October 6, 2015. The complaint, however, was registered only on November 14, 2015, 39 days after the incident. On March 15, 2019, the tribunal dismissed the claim citing inordinate delay in the lodging of the complaint. Several inadequaciesAfter perusing the materials on record, a division bench headed by Justice HB Prabhakara Sastry pointed out several inadequacies in the claimant’s case. The bench noted the statement indicated that Jagannath’s son was riding the motorcycle and was unhurt. He had shifted his father to a hospital. He could have lodged the complaint at the earliest but chose not to do it. The bench pointed out that all the children of the claimant had already visited the hospital and attended to Jagannath within two days of the accident. “That means information about the accident had reached all the kith and kin of the claimant without any delay and he was attended to by all his family members and relatives. In spite of the same, none of them evinced any interest in lodging the complaint with respect to the alleged road traffic accident,” it said. Also, no medico-legal case report (MLC) was submitted by the hospital to the police about the road traffic accident. The bench said the claimant himself had admitted that his son’s motorcycle was not covered by insurance. The court said the claimant probably chose not to implead the motorcycle because it lacked insurance and also because the rider was his son. The motor vehicle inspection report indicated that the front portions of both the motorcycles were damaged. The bench pointed out that if the accident had happened in the manner described by the claimant, the damage to Jagannath’s son’s motorcycle should have been to the rear, not to the front. The court concluded that the claimant’s statement showed that he did not know the details of the offending motorcycle or its owner at the time of the accident. It was only through some unknown person that he came to know that the bike belonged to a fellow villager.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-plaint-delay-can-help-in-deciding-genuineness/articleshow/87231943.cms||Vasantha Kumar

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Administration takes a back seat as CM Basavaraj Bommai, ministers get busy with campaign||BENGALURU: The state’s administration has almost come to a standstill for a week now as chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and a majority of his cabinet colleagues have been busy campaigning for Sindgi and Hangal bypolls, leaving the works in their respective departments to officials. The situation is likely to continue till the public campaign ends on October 28. There are complaints about increasing pendency of files in various departments and several people who have been coming to Vidhana Soudha from faraway places to meet ministers are forced to return. Officers have been rescheduling important meetings due to non-availability of ministers. Many are even wondering as to why these “insignificant” polls have become a priority for the ministers over their official works. BENGALURU An MLA of the ruling party too expressed displeasure over the ministers campaigning for several days. “What is the necessity to deploy so many ministers in bypolls, when the outcome will have no bearing either on the government or the BJP,” he asked. “It amazes me to see so many ministers campaigning for two bypolls which have no political significance,” said a businessman from Udupi, who had come to meet industries minister Murugesh Nirani on Friday but in vain. Barring a few ministers like CN Ashwath Narayan, N Munirathna and CV Nagesh, others have been camping in Sindgi and Hangal for the past one week. The party has appointed a team of four ministers each headed by Govind Karjol and Murugesh Nirani as in-charge of Sindgi and Hangal, respectively, and they have been making trips to these constituencies from October first week. According to a BJP office-bearer, 20 MLAs have also been deployed. Even the CM has been making a whirlwind tour of Hangal constituency for the past four days along with his predecessor BS Yediyurappa. The bypoll has become a prestige issue for Bommai as Hangal falls in his home district Haveri and a defeat here would have serious implications on his leadership. “Bommai is desperate to win the Hangal seat in order to justify the party's decision to face the 2023 assembly polls under his leadership,” said Nagaraj, a BJP functionary from Hangal. The presence of the CM and ministers has also made district administrations devote their entire time to them. “On one hand, they are sending DCs to villages to take administration to the doorsteps of people. On the other hand, they themselves are escaping from their basic responsibilities,” alleged K Mahantesh, state secretary, Centre for Indian Trade Unions.  Agriculture minister BC Patil said no government work is hampered due to their absence in Bengaluru. “Technology helps us monitor things from anywhere. People who want to meet us personally may have been facing some problem but they can always call us on our phones,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/administration-takes-a-back-seat-as-cm-mins-get-busy-with-campaign/articleshow/87231945.cms||Anil Gejji

The final was won and lost in the first game itself as Kishan clinched the first game 203-135 for a runaway 68-pin lead. Akaash was unlucky to have three splits despite coming up with good shots. To top it all, the bespectacled pro missed two spares as well. It was probably one of his lowest games in over a decade.With the title more or less decided, Kishan played with a lot more freedom in the second and took it 200-193 for a crushing victory.That didn’t look like coming at one stage in the semifinals when and he and third-round leader Parvez Ahmed were tied (383-383) after the two games. However, Kishan, a two-handed hook bowler, got a strike to Parvez’s eight pins in the one-ball roll-off. Akaash had it easy on the other last-four clash, accounting for spin bowler Srinath Pobbathi 497-362.Results: Final: R Kishan bt Akaash Ashok Kumar 403-328 (203-135, 200-193). Semis: Kishan bt Parvez Ahmed 383-383 (207-201, 176-182). Wins in one-ball roll-off; Akaash bt Srinath Pobbathi 497-363 (258-190, 239-172). Rd 3 (after 18 games): 1.

---||India||Kiren Rijiju, Uddhav Thackeray take swipe at each other at HC event||AURANGABAD: The inauguration of two new wings of the Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench on Saturday saw an uneasy exchange of words between Union law minister Kiren Rijiju and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. At the end of his formal address on the occasion, Rijiju said the foundation stone of two buildings was laid during the term of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and termed its inauguration at the hands of Thackeray as an example of ‘teamwork’. During his speech, Thackeray touched upon Rijiju’s comments. “Yes, I came here today only to raise the flag as a mark of inauguration. However, it is my commitment that the inauguration of the new complex of Bombay high court at the principal bench will take place soon and it will be accomplished during my term only,” he said. Fadnavis, during his term, had laid the foundation stone of the annex building of Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court in July 2018. BJP and Shiv Sena had locked horns over taking credit for the Chipi airport in Sindhudurga district. Ahead of the formal inauguration of the airport on October 9, both camps had put up posters claiming credit. Earlier, during his speech, Rijiju stressed on the need to reduce the gap between the justice delivery system and the public. “We are the largest democracy in the world and genuine efforts can ensure justice for all despite many challenges,” he said. Thackeray pledged his efforts for speedy justice to all. “I commit to you all that my government stands firm behind the efforts of strengthening our judiciary,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kiren-rijiju-uddhav-thackeray-take-swipe-at-each-other-at-hc-event/articleshow/87231960.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Goa||Torn by fate, neglected by state, Goa para table tennis players train at home||PANAJI: Lloyd Fernandes and Patrick D’Souza have both seen better days in table tennis. During their time in higher secondary school, they played in state championships with Lloyd being part of the tournament-winning squad at Dhempe HSS, Miramar. Now, they are trying their hand at the sport again, but it’s not so easy. When Patrick tries to return his opponent’s serve, it just whizzes by. Lloyd is found wanting too. His mind knows exactly what to do when a smash comes his way, but his body just won’t react. It’s understandable. Both, after all, are now on wheelchairs, playing table tennis. Patrick had a “normal childhood” till he was 14, but the 40-year-old has muscular dystrophy, a disease that causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. He’s been on a wheelchair since 2015. Lloyd, 34, met with a motorbike accident in the city five years ago and was bed-ridden for ten months. Every time he tried to sit, his blood pressure simply dropped, and he fainted. “Table tennis provides a sense of joy,” says Lloyd, taking a break from training at his Taleigao residence. “It makes me feel relaxed. Continuous physiotherapy (to strengthen the muscles) is boring. This sport provides a welcome break.” Lloyd is not playing table tennis just for fun or to relive his teenage memories. He’s serious about winning Goa’s first medal at the Para Table Tennis National Championships. So serious that he has hired a personal coach and watched YouTube videos for hours at end. More importantly, thanks to inaccessible stadiums, set up a table tennis table of his own at home. The task at hand is huge. Only one Goan—Gopal Naik—has ever made it to the pre-quarterfinals or the last-16 stage at the nationals. “A medal can work wonders for the fraternity,” says Avelino De Sa, president of the Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) and secretary for para table tennis committee of Goa Table Tennis Association. “More people will get attracted to the sport. They will be keen to follow in the medal winners’ footsteps. The government, too, will take notice.” For now, the government just don’t seem to care. “There are many players in Goa but there is no place to train. The government created infrastructure for the National Games, but none of the stadiums are accessible (for wheelchair athletes),” says Patrick. At Campal, where the Indoor Stadium has been refurbished at an estimated cost of Rs 16 crore, the table tennis facility is on the first floor. Wheelchair athletes can’t get there because the lift is non-functional. “We were allotted a table at the Shyama Prasad stadium in Bambolim, but whenever it was rented out for exhibitions, the table was packed away without notice,” says Lloyd. Even if the team wants to travel for national championships, like the one coming up in Indore in December, they have to first pay from their own pockets and then wait for reimbursements. Wheelchair-bound players like Lloyd need two people to lift him—usually his wife and father—so he’ll have to make his own arrangements. “SAG (Sports Authority of Goa) only provides for train fare. Many wheelchair users cannot travel by train, some of the stations are not wheelchair friendly. The government must modify the scheme and allow the players to travel by air,” says Avelino. Para table tennis was launched in Goa two years ago and the last championship attracted 30 players, 10 of them wheelchair-bound. The sport has two categories—standing and wheelchair—and several classifications. “To participate in sports events, you need an active or sports wheelchair which can cost anywhere between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1 lakh. If the government cared, they could have invested in wheelchairs and allowed these to be used by those who are chasing a dream,” says Vrishank Nagvekar, a veteran who has previously taken part in wheelchair basketball and lawn tennis. Other players say the least anyone could have done is provide access to the physically challenged to training facilities, where the government has spent crores of the exchequer’s money. “What is the point in rewarding sportspersons after they have won medals,” asks Avelino. “Players here have to train on their own. The government must first invest in the athletes and then expect medals.” Indian athletes returned home with a rich haul of 19 medals from the Tokyo Paralympics this year. Everyone shared their joy. In Goa, though, it’s a different story.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/torn-by-fate-neglected-by-state-goa-para-table-tennis-players-train-at-home/articleshow/87231046.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Young women were seen buying sparkling bangles and applying mehendi on their palms, arms and feet for the special day. On Sunday, women will observe fast from morning to moonrise for the well-being of their husbands. The festival falls on the fourth day of the dark fortnight (waning phase of the moon) in the month of Kartik as per the Hindu lunar calendar. “We are giving 40-50% discounts on different packages and beauty treatment (waxing, cleansing, manicure, pedicure, facial and hair cut),” said Soni Singh, manager of a parlour near Fraser road. Ragini Kumari (29), a resident of Ashiana Colony, said, “I have made all the preparations to make the day a special one. As we will complete four years of our marriage, I have prepared a short film by collecting all the good memories that we had together,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/karva-chauth-today-married-women-throng-markets/articleshow/87230007.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Goa||Goa is the new model of development: PM Modi||PANAJI: Giving a broad hint to re-elect the BJP government for another term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said Goa is the new model of development and a double-engine government would lead to overall growth of the state. “Goa is about happiness, nature and tourism, but today I will say that Goa means a new model of development. Goa requires a double-engine government, Goa needs clean policies, Goa needs a stable government and a leadership like the existing one,” Modi said. He said the double-engine government at the Centre and the state is focusing on infrastructure development in villages, urban and coastal belt and projects like the second airport at Mopa, logistics hub, second largest cable stay bridge and expansion of national highways will provide new dimensions for national and international connectivity. “The way my friend late Manohar Parrikar has taken Goa towards a faster pace of development, chief minister Pramod Sawant’s team is achieving new heights. Today, Goa is moving forward with a new confidence. Swayampurna Goa is the result of the team spirit of the Goa government,” Modi told Swayampurna Mitras and beneficiaries of Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swayampurna Goem. Giving the example of a football team, Modi said: “Goa’s craze for football is at a different level. In football whether it is a defender or a forward, all are goal oriented. Some people want to save the goal and others want to score. The sentiment to score a goal was never lacking in Goa, but earlier governments did not have the team spirit and there was a lack of a positive environment. For a long time, there was political selfishness in Goa which overshadowed the administration.” He said instability in successive governments had severely damaged Goa’s progress, but in the past few years, “smart people have turned instability into stability”. Modi said Goa’s environment and tourism are directly linked to the country’s development and the tiniest state is the epicentre of India’s tourism sector. “The share of the tour, travel and hospitality industry is increasing in the fastest growing economy. It is obvious that Goa’s contribution to this sector is also immense,” he said. Modi said because of high vaccination coverage, there is a new confidence among tourists and people. “The preparations are on for Diwali, Christmas and New Year. During the holidays and the festive season, Goa’s tourism sector will usher in new energy. Goa will witness huge inflow of tourists—domestic and international—which is a positive sign for the state’s tourism sector,” he said, adding the Centre has given crores of rupees to improve tourism infrastructure. He said for infrastructure modernisation in villages, the Centre has increased the allotment of funds by five times and Rs 500 crore has been allotted for rural development. This will speed up the work taken up by the state government in agriculture and animal husbandry sectors and help farmers, fisherman, dairy farmers, among others to increase their income. He also said despite various challenges faced by the state like Covid-19 and Cyclone Tauktae, the state and the Centre have worked together to provide relief. “We have never stopped development works in the state,” he said. Referring to his Independence Day speech where he had said that they have to reach out to people with all the schemes, Modi said, “Pramod Sawant and his team are leading the state in achieving this goal.” Congratulating Sawant and his team for taking up developmental works under Swayampurna Goa, Modi said, “To fast-track this, the state government has launched governance at your doorstep initiative. This is a proactive and pro-people government in line with the policies of the Union government.” Starting his address in Konkani, the Prime Minister congratulated the people of the state for working towards making Goa self-sufficient under Swayampurna Goa and said it has immense potential to develop the economy. “The Centre has set a target to make India open defecation free and Goa has achieved it 100%. The country has also set a target to provide electricity connection to every house, and here too Goa achieved it 100%. Under Har Ghar Jal, Goa has become the first state to provide 100% water connections. Two days ago, the country was able to administer vaccine doses to 100 crore population. Goa has become the first state to administer the first dose of vaccine to the eligible population and put its full strength to achieve 100% vaccination for the eligible population,” he said. “Goa means reflection of collective efforts. Goa means coming together of panchayat to administration for development. Everything now lies with Goa to make it self-sufficient,” he said. Modi said he is happy to see that the state government has been able to reach out to people through the schemes that have been launched by the Union government for the upliftment and to honour women. “Goa has done exceptional work in providing ample facilities to women,” he said. He also said Swayampurna Goa’s focus is on providing security to the women of the state, generating employment for youth, and a prosperous future for Goa. “This is not restricted to a five-year programme, but the first phase of 25 years of vision, and all should join,” Modi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-is-the-new-model-of-development-pm-modi/articleshow/87230959.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Patna||Firecrackers ban in Patna and 3 other districts this Diwali too||PATNA: Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has decided to continue its complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers in Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali this Diwali too.  A decision in this regard was taken following a directive of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to maintain ambient air quality in all cities. In other towns of the state, only green or eco-friendly crackers will be allowed on Diwali. Arun Kumar, a senior scientist and air pollution expert at BSPCB, said Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Hajipur have been deemed as “non-attainment cities” where the air quality, as per the records maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is polluted beyond the prescribed national ambient air quality standards. Hence, the licence for sale of crackers will not be issued to these cities. For compliance of NGT order, a letter has been issued to all the district magistrates, senior superintendents of police and SPs. They have been asked to ensure that banned firecrackers are not sold in the market. Those found illegally selling firecrackers will have to pay penalties. In a letter issued on Wednesday, the BSPCB’s member secretary, S Chandrashekhar, said toxic pollutants from crackers would affect residents’ health and people should avoid bursting crackers this festive season. “In four cities, where the ambient air index data was found to be ‘poor or above’ in November 2020, sale and use of crackers are banned to protect the health of the vulnerable people. Other cities are allowed to burst green firecrackers. As per the order, the firecrackers can be burst between 8pm and 10pm on Diwali and Guruparv. During Chhath, the firecrackers can be burst from 6am to 8am. On Christmas and New Year Day, people can burst crackers from 11.55pm to 12.30am,” says the order.

He will land at the airport in the afternoon along with his wife Rabri Devi and elder daughter Misa Bharti. Lalu’s arrival ahead of byelection in two assembly constituencies – Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga and Tarapur in Munger – is expected to invigorate RJD workers. The two constituencies will go to polls on October 30. Sources said Lalu would address at least one meeting each at Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur. “A final decision regarding the campaign will be taken after Lalu’s arrival,” said a senior RJD leader. RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tirawi said Lalu’s arrival would enthuse party workers. “Old-timers who have worked with the RJD chief will be happy to see him back,” Tiwari said. Lalu’s arrival will also give a shot in the arm to leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who had to face the wrath of his elder brother Tej Pratap. Tejashwi has been campaigning vigorously against JD(U) and Congress candidates in the two constituencies. It is almost after a gap of three-and-a-half years that Lalu is coming to Patna. He had last come to Patna in May 2018 on a parole to attend his elder son Tej Pratap’s wedding. After his release from the jail in April this year, Lalu was undergoing treatment in Delhi where he had been staying at the house of Misa. Sources said keeping in mind Lalu’s health, the family has decided to curtail public meetings. A special room has been prepared for Lalu at Rabri’s official 10, Circular Road bungalow with medical facilities. “There is immense happiness in the party. Even Laluji’s family members are happy with his return. There are chances that Chhath would be observed at Rabri’s bungalow this time,” said another RJD leader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/lalu-to-reach-patna-today-likely-to-hit-campaign-trail/articleshow/87230058.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Police arrested Tejas Patel (26), an electronics and communication engineer and his aide Chirag Bharai (23) Police have recovered the looted cash, two cars and mobile phones all together worth Rs 84 lakh from the accused. Patel is a trader of computer software and hardware products. He recently got order of software from a diamond unit to check the quality of diamonds. Patel approached Parth Paladiya, a software engineer for the same. “The plan was that Patel will copy the software on his laptop after paying cash to Paladiya. Once he left Paladiya’s office the other accused would carry out the loot,” said B D Gohil, police inspector, Katargam police station. They executed the crime exactly as planned, he added. After Patel left, Bharai and Raju Mori entered Paladiya’s office and looted the cash at knife-point and escaped.

Pandey said the NDA partners had offered only 15 seats to the LJP in the assembly polls. “It was not possible to fulfil the dreams of the party’s founder late Ram Vilas Paswan with the seats offered to the LJP by the NDA,” he wrote. “The party’s ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ vision document was prepared with the consent of senior Paswan and it was proposed to be launched at a meeting to be held at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. But it could not be held due to Covid pandemic,” the letter read. “Mein Bihar ko Ram Vilas Paswan ki ankhon se dekhta hun. Bihar first, Bihari first document was prepared with the sole motive to put Bihar on the top of the development map in the country,” Saurabh’s letter read. Paras had earlier alleged that it was Saurabh who provoked Chirag to snap ties with the NDA, which resulted in the party’s poor performance in the assembly polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/chirag-left-nda-as-ljp-was-offered-only-15-seats/articleshow/87230118.cms||Ramashankar
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Proposed waste-to-energy plant to lower stress on landfill||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is giving the final touches to its 15 MW waste-to-energy plant, which is under construction at Kapuluppada dumping yard. The civic body recently conducted a trial run at the plant. Once it is operationalised, the plant will reduce burden on the landfill as the GVMC has to supply to it 950 metric tonnes of waste a day. The city generates about 1,100 MT of garbage a day. The civic body entered into a concession agreement with Jindal Infrastructure, Transportation, Fabrication in February 2016. The Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL) will procure power from the plant for 25 years. Even though the project was supposed to be completed much before, several factors led to the delay in the development of the plant. Speaking to STOI, GVMC engineering officials said the plant will be ready for commissioning by the end of November or the first half of December. “Recently, the GVMC conducted a trial run with about 500 MT of garbage. The works are nearing completion on all components,” an official informed. The total area available at Kapuluppada site is about 110 acres. Apart from the plant, the GVMC has earmarked some land for the scientific landfill. According to experts, scientific landfill is one of the best suitable options for disposal of inert residues generated from the waste-to-energy plant. The process of land filling involves scientific disposal of waste in an eco-friendly manner to protect the environment. The garbage, piled over the years at Kapuluppada dumping yard without any processing, had turned into a challenge for the GVMC. All these factors have forced the civic body to look for an alternative in the form of a waste-to-energy plant for the mounting garbage issue in the city. According to experts, the waste-to-energy plant helps avoid the production of methane, while producing almost 10 times more electricity from each tonne of waste compared to landfills. Unorganised waste management practices could pose an array of threats — right from open burning which releases toxic gases to pollutants seeping into groundwater and raising subsequent health problems.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/proposed-wte-plant-to-lower-stress-on-landfill/articleshow/87229770.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Goa||From housewives to fisherman, PM Modi hears about Goans’ journey towards self-reliance||PANAJI: Less than a year ago, Nishita Namdev Gawas was a housewife in the village of Pale-Cottambi, Bicholim, whose husband had lost his income due to closure of mining activity in Goa. On Saturday, Nishita found herself interacting virtually with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as one of the Goan beneficiaries under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swayampurna Goem’ programme. “Sisters like you have proven the huge potential our country holds,” Modi told Nishita, who is among 13 women running a food processing unit today at Pale. The unit processes local produce like star fruit and jackfruit into saleable eatables. Narrating her journey, Nishita told the PM that the unit has seen a turnover of more than Rs 2 lakh over the past few months. “Never in my wildest dream had I thought I would be speaking to the Prime Minister one day. I was nervous when I was told about it two days ago. We were just 13 housewives who were forced to work suddenly during the pandemic to make ends meet at home,” said Nishita, whose group received training and the processing centre space from the state government through the Goa State Biodiversity Board and machinery sponsored by the Goa Shipyard. Vasco-based para sportsperson Ruki Ahmed Rajasaab told the Prime Minister of having received assistance like wheelchair, crutches and access to the state and central government schemes for the disabled through Swayampurna Mitras. “Aap bhi meri tarah chaiwalle hain (you too are a teaseller like me),” Modi joked with Rajasaab, who runs a tea stall at the Vasco bus stand. A traditional fisherman Luis Cardozo told the Prime Minister that he received a partial amount from the government, enabling him to purchase an insulated vehicle to transport his day’s catch. This has increased the life of his fish catch and in turn Cardozo's income, the beneficiary told Modi. “Excellent! You have revived a lake in your village, which was almost non-existent due to years of neglect,” said Modi, praising Betalbatim sarpanch Constancio Miranda, who also told the PM how 7.5 lakh sqm of fallow land has been brought under cultivation again in his village with assistance under Krishi card. Durgesh Shirodkar, chairman of Goa Dairy, told the Prime Minister that Goa’s milk production has gone up by 8,000 litres since last year due to benefits received under the Kisan Credit Cards. “Under the Kisan Credit Card, dairy farmers receive loans to expand their business at an interest rate of only seven percent. Those who pay this loan within a year are charged zero percent interest rate and you can use the card to claim further credit. This has greatly helped Goan dairy farmers, we have registered 1,970 across Goa under Kisan Credit Card,” Shirodkar told TOI. “Saturday was a great occasion for me. Just 10 days ago, when home minister Amit Shah visited Dharbandora in Goa, Goa Dairy was chosen as the ‘safe house’ as part of his security arrangements. Now we got an opportunity to interact with the PM. It shows Goa Dairy and dairy farmers in Goa have grown and has brought us new hope,” said Shirodkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/from-housewives-to-fisherman-pm-hears-about-goans-journey-towards-self-reliance/articleshow/87230990.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: At this temple, daru offered as dava & dua to ‘cure’ alcoholics||AHMEDABAD: You may have heard that diamond cuts diamond, but have you heard of alcohol beating alcohol? In Lord Panchia Dada temple in Ghaghretia village in Limdi taluka of Surendragar district, devotees come from afar to offer liquor – along with ‘bitings’ – to the deity, in hope to help their loved one overcome alcohol addiction! Though Gujarat has been a dry state since its formation in 1960, the small temple located outside the temple of Goddess Moma Maa gets visitors almost every day. Many of them even come from states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, say locals. While some offer country liquor, others bring India Made Foreign Liquor. “Recently, a person from Mumbai brought bottles of wine to offer to the deity,” said Manu Chauhan, chairman of the village’s Nyay Samiti. Village sarpanch Shamat Bharwad says, “Our village is famous for the miracles worked by Panchia Dada. Visitors, not just from other district but also other states, who want their family members to quit liquor addiction come here.” He adds, “People have been visiting this temple for more than a century. Even my grandfather does not remember when the tradition started. It all began with a myth that a saint helped people combat alcohol addiction through divine powers. Later, a temple was built in his honour. However, there’s no historical proof of this.” This is not the only temple in the state where liquor is offered to deities. In Ahmedabad city, locals offered liquor to Lord Bhairavnath at a temple in Maninagar and Goddess Meldi in Naroda. People also flocked to Bhathiji Maharaj temple in Davda village in Kheda district and a Kaal-Bhairav temple in Bhuj town of Kutch. However, while the number of devotees have almost dwindled to nil in these places after strict liquor laws were put in place. The Panchia Dada temple continues to attract believers with people offering anything from a ‘quarteriya’ to a ‘khambha’ of liquor as per their capability. Bottles of IMFL and polythene bags containing country liquor are found strewn around the temple premises but the village has reportedly never faced any police action. “We ensure that no liquor is sold or consumed in the village so no one faces any legal trouble,” explains Bharwad. Villagers ensure that the liquor offered at the temple is neither stolen nor given to anyone. “The stoppers on the bottles are removed and the spirit evaporates,” he says. Asked whether they have had to face the police since ferrying or possession of liquor is also a crime in the state, Bharwad quips, “What can they do in the matter of god?” Recollecting an incident, Chauhan says, “Around two years ago, a police team raided the temple and one of the cops broke a liquor bottle. This is a strict no-no, according to local beliefs. The very next day, he met with an accident in which he fractured his hand. Later, he came to the temple and offered a bottle of alcohol to the deity as a mark of apology.” He adds that devotees also offer snacks like chavanu (local spicy snack mix) and nuts to go along with the alcohol. A Mumbai resident who offered liquor at the temple, said on condition of anonymity, “I heard about the temple from a close relative after my elder son became an alcoholic. I offered an IMFL bottle last month and have been waiting to get some favourable results.” Savita Halmatia, a resident of another village in Limbdi taluka, said, “I offered liquor to the deity as my husband was addicted to alcohol. When my husband got to know about it, he stopped drinking fearing the deity’s wrath.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/at-this-temple-daru-offered-as-dava-dua-to-cure-alcoholics/articleshow/87230401.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Jaipur||HC allows RTE quota in pre-primary classes in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court on Saturday directed the state government to conduct admissions to pre-primary classes under the Right to Education (RTE) Act's 25% quota for the EWS children. A double bench of Justices Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Farzand Ali passed the interim order on a petition challenging the RTE quota rules of 2020-21, exempting private schools from 25% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in their pre-primary classes. The final hearing will be on November 17. For the past two years, the state is holding the admissions only for Class 1 under the quota, leading to a reduction of quota seats from 2 lakh to 60,000. The RTE admission process is concluding on October 24 and the state is left with no choice but to extend the date to adjust admissions for over 1 lakh additional seats in private schools. The court observed that excluding pre-primary classes is a violation of the RTE Act. The petitioner, Pranjal Singh of Abhyutthanam Society working for underprivileged children had challenged the state government's RTE rules of 2020-21. “The honourable high court has corrected the government for committing a horrendous sin of closing the window of opportunity to access quality education through the act. Hope the government will allow over a lakh students to benefit under the law,” Singh said. Last year, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights summoned the state for violating the RTE norms. The rule says that in schools that impart pre-school education, the provision of 25% reservation must apply at the entry level. Singh added that the RTE empowers the government to frame rules and regulations, but can not allow them to tamper with the soul of its main provisions. Most of the schools in the state have pre-primary classes and the state norm of admission from Class 1 has roped over a lakh students to take admission under the act. The state government had contended that since they are not getting the Centre's share on time, they are under financial stress. The state has to disburse around Rs 10,500 per child admitted under the quota to private schools, with 40% of it coming from the Centre. A senior education department official said they will study the order and act accordingly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/hc-allows-rte-quota-in-pre-primary-classes-in-raj/articleshow/87231015.cms||---

He, along with special chief secretary Satish Chandra, addressed a press conference here on Saturday and said GO No. 24 issued by the previous government created confusion among the universities in implementing the timescale. Hemachandra Reddy said the timescale is being strictly implemented in junior and degree colleges while there are some glitches in implementing the same in universities. “A total of 2,100 contract professor posts are there in 16 universities. There is no clarity on the government sanctioned posts and self-finance posts. Government has already said it will soon announce a job calendar with 2,000 assistant professor posts. We are taking necessary measures to implement minimum pay scale for the contract lecturers and increase the salaries of teaching faculty at JNTU Kakinada, JNTU Anantapur, and Adikavi Nannaya University,” Reddy said. He condemned the allegations made by Opposition parties on employing aided college lecturers in universities. “Only 300 out of 800 aided lecturers are fit to be recruited to universities. We condemn the baseless statements,” he said. Special chief secretary Satish Chandra said regularisation of contract staff is not possible as per the judgements of Supreme Court and asked the contract lecturers to take APPSC assistant professor examinations soon.

---||Vijayawada||Hologram mfg cos formed cartel, alleges PIL||Vijayawada: A PIL petition has been filed before the AP high court, seeking a CBI inquiry into alleged scam in the tender called for supplying security holograms to AP State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL). One V Sivaraman from Chennai moved the high court, alleging that the companies that participated in the tender formed a cartel with the active connivance of officials in the excise department, thereby causing huge loss to the exchequer. The tender for supplying security holograms was floated in September 2020 and subsequently allotted to Kumbhat Holographics. The other two companies that participated in the tender were Alpha Lasertek India LLP and Holostik India Limited. While all three companies were declared eligible in the first stage of the tender, Alpha Lasertek and Holostik India did not satisfy the evaluation process and the tender was allotted to Kubhat Holographics, which was the lowest bidder. Sivaraman alleged that as per the tender norms, the participating companies should not have conflict of interest with the other. The term ‘conflict of interest’ was also defined in the tender norms in clause 6.12.2, which stated that the participating companies should not have any business relation with each other that could influence the price bid. Though the three companies were declared eligible in the first stage of the tender evaluation process, Sivaraman alleged that all three had business agreements among them. While Holostik India and Kubhat were business partners in selling nano optic products under a joint agreement, Alpha Lasertek India LLP has a business relationship with Holostik India, he alleged in the PIL. Holostik India was also debarred from bidding by the excise department in 2012, which made it ineligible to bid for the tender, alleged Sivaraman. As the three companies had business relations among them, they should have been disqualified in the first stage but the excise department allowed the bids and allotted the tender to Kumbhat in violation of norms, said Sivaraman, urging the high court to order a CBI inquiry in view of large-scale misappropriations. He stated further that he moved the high court after complaints and representations to the chief secretary and the state vigilance commissioner elicited no response. When contacted, APSBCL managing director D Vasudeva Reddy declined to comment on the issue as the matter is sub judice. None of the three companies responded to e-mails, text messages or phone calls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hologram-mfg-cos-formed-cartel-alleges-pil/articleshow/87229786.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The victim was identified as Krishna Rai (58), a resident of Revra Singiyari village. His wife Hema Devi is a sarpanch candidate from Revra panchayat. The polling is scheduled to take place in the panchayat on November 3. Police said the murder was probably the fallout of a land dispute. “Rai had a dispute with one of his cousins, Manish Kumar, over a six-kattha land,” police added. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said Rai was shot in head from behind. “Rai had left his residence for the paddy field before sunrise. The villagers spotted his body lying in a pool of blood there and informed the police,” he said. Dhillon said Manish was arrested in connection with the case. Probe ordered into police firing Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the Dhanarua police firing in which one person had died and three others were injured on Friday night. The role of injured Masaurhi circle inspector Ram Kumar Prasad is under suspicion. Mauriyawa panchayat mukhiya candidate Satyendra Sah is also accused of instigating the mob against police. The police had gone to the village to stop illegal campaigning when the incident occurred. Dhanarua SHO Raju Kumar, a constable, seven home guard jawans, two special auxiliary police personnel and a chowkidar were injured when the villagers attacked them. Police sources said at least 15 rounds were fired by villagers too. The DM said Masaurhi SDO Anil Kumar Sinha will conduct the magisterial inquiry. “Masaurhi SDO and SPDO have been asked to submit an initial report on the incident within 24 hours,” he added. Singh said the villagers have alleged that the CI used excessive force. The DM added he had formed a medical board that conducted postmortem on the victim’s amid the presence of a magistrate at the PMCH on Saturday.  “Entire process was also video recorded. Aggrieved family will be given all possible assistance,” the DM said. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma also visited the village on Saturday morning.

---||Vadodara||Selection of PRO, registrar questioned||Vadodara: Continuing their tirade against M S University officials, a group of 10 syndics on Saturday questioned the appointments of registrar and public relations officer (PRO) at the university. The university officials have, however, refuted the allegations. Alleging favouritism and nepotism, the group of senate and syndicate members said that the best example of how recruitment scam happens at the university is appointment of Lakulish Trivedi as PRO. “The university officials first decide a candidate who is to be selected against a said post. Based on that notification describing eligibility for the post is issued,” they alleged. Trivedi, the group alleged, neither holds any bachelors or masters degree in the field of journalism, nor has minimum five years experience in 5400 grade which was required for the post. The group alleged that there was an age-cap of 40 years for the post of PRO but it was relaxed to accommodate Trivedi, who is 42-years-old. “Trivedi used to carry out scanning job for some private bank as a temporary clerk in his college. It was mentioned as required qualification for the post of PRO,” the group alleged. The three syndicate members who are part of the group have claimed that during the last syndicate meeting they had sought a summary statement of all the candidates who had applied for the post of registrar which MSU VC, Prof Parimal Vyas refused to provide. Reacting on the allegations, Vyas said that the group has sought expert assessment. “Since 1949, we have never opened expert assessment. The said group is demanding that we should open expert assessment. We have called syndicate meeting on October 25. Let all the syndicate members take a call,” Vyas told TOI. On the other hand, MSU registrar Dr K M Chudasama said that if the candidate was not eligible for the post, he would have been rejected at the scrutiny level and would have never been called for interview. The group, however, has raised questions on Chudasama’s appointment as well. It has alleged that he does not hold experience required for the post which is the highest administrative post in the university system.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/selection-of-pro-registrar-questioned/articleshow/87229876.cms||---

A 325-metre-long stretch between J P roundabout and Children’s Park adjacent to DM’s residence near Gandhi Maidan will be developed as a dedicated ‘Happy Street’. Under the smart city project, the earmarked area will have well-laid footpaths, greenery on road median, avenue plantation, heritage wall, walking and cycling tracks besides other amenities. Modern food stalls and mobile food vehicles will be there on one side of the road so that people can enjoy the food items. The area will be brightly lit. The Happy Street is expected to be ready by the next six months with an estimated expenditure of Rs 7 crore. The PSCL inked an agreement with a Patna-based private firm on Friday for the two smart city projects – Happy Street and renovation of S K Memorial Hall. Harshita, public relation officer of PSCL and Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), said the two smart city projects would be completed by April next year. “The whole idea of the Happy Street is to provide a dedicated space to people where they can walk, run, jog, dance, cycle, sing, skate and play. People can socialise comfortably and safely,” she said. “Beautification of western periphery of Gandhi Maidan will be done by landscape lighting and refurbishment of boundary wall. Large-size LED screens will be installed inside the western part of Gandhi Maidan while a dynamic façade lighting will be installed at Biscouman Bhawan. The project also includes the beautification of JP roundabout,” Harshita said. A PSCL official said the initiative was aimed at encouraging people to come out to the streets every Sunday to socialize through a wide array of activities. “Traffic movement will also be restricted for a few hours on Sundays so that people can walk, run, play, do yoga and dance on the street freely,” the official added. For the renovation of S K Memorial Hall, a ground linear fountain has been proposed. Colourful changing lights (dome and arch and interior fill light) will be fitted to give an attractive look to the building during night. New archway for entry and exit will also come up. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 4.8 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hit-happy-street-near-gandhi-maidan-from-april-next-year/articleshow/87230047.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fire began in video doorbell, wood panels fanned flames||MUMBAI: The fire at One Avighna Park’s 19th floor was most likely caused by a short circuit in the electronic video door bell of the apartment and it spread rapidly into the flat due to the wooden panel on the walls, the Fire Brigade’s preliminary investigation has revealed. A detailed probe into the incident is going on and a report is expected next week. Senior fire brigade officials said that “crucial time” was lost as the building’s fire-fighting system wasn’t automatically activated when the fire broke out, which could have prevented it from spreading into the flat and gutting the 19th floor. The fire brigade on Saturday restored power and residents were allowed back into their homes. BMC officials said that there was no structural threat to the building which was given an occupation certificate in 2018. A major fire broke out at 60-storey One Avighna Park near Lalbaug on Friday, killing a security guard. “It is likely that the fire broke out due to a short circuit on the video doorbell. It spread since the entire walls had wooden panel. This caused the fire to spread,” said a fire official. Fire brigade officials said they had to manually activate the fire-fighting system which caused a delay of around 15-minutes. “If the system were operational on its own, the fire could have been contained faster,” said a senior fire brigade official. Joint municipal commissioner Ramesh Pawar said they are verifying if the latest compliance form for the fire-fighting system had been submitted. “The cause of the fire and whether or not the fire-fighting system was operational automatically will come out once the investigation is done,” said Pawar. The developer of the high-rise refuted the flat owner’s claim that the fire-fighting system was not working and said all systems were in place. “People may have panicked and delayed switching on the fire-fighting system. Fire brigade officials have said that the fire-fighting system was operative but pressure was low but it increased later,” said Kailash Agarwal, chairperson of Avighna Group. He said they had submitted the compliance report in January and July 2021 . “We have acknowledgements.” Managing director Nishant Agarwal said they have been very particular about fire safety and a mock drill was done on October 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fire-began-in-video-doorbell-wood-panels-fanned-flames-in-mumbai/articleshow/87231814.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

And, most of them are remand prisoners with some struggling to get bail. There are 1,188 prisoners who have been booked under NDPS Act, and of them 28 (male) are serving sentences varying from one to 10 years. Of the 1,160 remand prisoners, 75 are female and some (ganja smugglers) from other states including Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Kerala. The central prison has 1,950 inmates (convicts and remand prisoners) with most of them facing ganja smuggling cases. Andhra Pradesh has four central prisons located at Vizag, Rajahmundry, Nellore and Kadapa. Lodging capacity at these facilities is 3,764 (3,634 male prisons and 130 female prisoners) but they are filled much beyond that due to various reasons. Speaking to TOI, president of Visakhapatnam Bar Association (VBA), G Maheswara Reddy said the NDPS Act is very stringent and getting bail is difficult in some cases. As per the Act, cases are booked under three categories - smugglers caught with one kg, between 1 kg and 20 kg, and 20 kg and above. For those booked below 1 kg of hemp, getting bail is easy, but for those caught with between one kg and 20 kg and above 20 kg it is difficult, and it may take over six months to get bail, he added .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/60-of-vizag-central-prison-inmates-facing-ganja-cases/articleshow/87229854.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Vijayawada||Tirumala: 5 years on, little advance at Octopus base camp||TIRUPATI: The construction of Octopus base camp in Tirumala remains incomplete even five years after the laying of the foundation stone in 2016. In keeping with the importance and security of the abode of Lord Venkateswara, commandos of Organisation for Counter Terror Operations (Octopus), the elite anti-terror force of AP police, have been guarding the hill town since 2009. With the number of Octopus units in Tirumala growing over the years, the police department proposed to set up a base camp for the force in the hill town and the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams also agreed to provide support. On July 18, 2016, then state DGP J V Ramudu laid the foundation stone for the Octopus base camp. The cost of construction work for the camp was estimated to be around Rs 15 crore. The camp was to come up on a 1.5 acre land parcel given by TTD, which also extended Rs 5 crore in the form of a grant towards construction work. More than five years have passed, but the base camp spot on the Tirumala-Papavinasanam dam route only has some unfinished concrete structures and the foundation stone plaque is surrounded by shrubs and bushes. The elite forces guarding Tirumala continue to stay at Kalyani guest house on the hill town, posing additional burden on the TTD in terms of rental value. When contacted, DGP D Gautam Sawang told TOI that construction works were stopped due to Covid-19 and also over issues with the contractor. “We take great pride in serving Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala through our elite forces. Resuming and completing the construction works of Octopus base camp at the earliest is one of our top priorities. The government has already sanctioned Rs 20 crore and we hope to restart the work very soon,” said Sawang.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/5-yrs-on-little-advance-at-octopus-base-camp/articleshow/87229503.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Patna||Only Congress can save country’s independence: Kanhaiya Kumar||PATNA:  Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, who joined the Congress recently, tells TOI’s Sheezan Nezami in an interview that amid “politics of division”, real issues are not being discussed in the country. Excerpts:From communist background to a Congressman, tell us about political journey so far? Will you be able to adjust yourself in the new environment?There is nothing to adjust. I will continue to fight on the same agendas which I had been fighting. I will continue to raise my voice against communalism and division on the basis of caste and religion. Politics has deviated from the agenda of unity in the country. You could have continued to fight on the above-mentioned issues even by remaining in the Left. Why Congress?Congress is the biggest party of the country county. It is the party which fought for the independence of our country and only this party can now protect that independence. Didn’t you realise all these things about Congress while you were in JNU?Campus politics is altogether a different subject. We go there to study. In real life, we unlearn many things that we learn in the educational institutions. You have come to campaign for the byelection. Against whom will you campaign – JD(U) or RJD?I will be campaigning on issues such as unemployment and migration. People of Bihar have been migrating to other states for job, treatment and education. Even for a honeymoon, people go outside Bihar. What has been done in the state which had such a glorious history? This is the land of Chanakya. It was Dashrath Manjhi who carved a path deep through a ridge of hills using only a hammer and a chisel. We also have different capabilities, but are abused outside Bihar. We are even hit by bullets nowadays. See what is happening to migrant workers from Bihar in Jammu & Kashmir. It is being said that Congress is projecting you as an alternative to Tejashwi. It is not like that. Tejashwi’s parents were chief ministers and I cannot be in the race with him. Even in the 2019 Lok Sabha election when I was fighting against RJD and JD(U), I did not speak against any person. This question is like ‘hasua ke byah me khurpi ke geet’. Let’s talk about real issues. What do you think of Nitish Kumar’s government?What Nitish Kumar did is visible, but few will not appreciate it. Look where Bihar stands in 30 years. After the 90s, everyone came together to demolish Congress. Why is Bihar lagging in the development index? I will repeat why people have to move to other states for everything? Can we expect Kanhaiya to play a bigger role in Bihar Congress in future?We believe in teamwork. I see Congress as a family and we all are its members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/only-congress-can-save-countrys-independence/articleshow/87230089.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The news that RJD chief Lalu Prasad will arrive at Patna on Sunday has enthused the two-party candidates – Arun Kumar Sah in Tarapur and Ganesh Bharti in Kusheshwar Asthan. This is happening at a time when the political circles are excited with the talks that the Congress has moved out of the Mahagathbandhan. In fact, when asked about it at a function held at Patna on Saturday, CM Nitish Kumar said, “Let them do their own work, I have no interest in it.” Nitish’s silence and distance from the actual electoral field is understandable as he has delegated the electioneering part to his party’s top brass. Union minister R C P Singh, JD(U) national president Lalan Singh and a host of MLAs and party workers, along with the NDA leaders like former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, deputy CM Tar Kishore Prasad, Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras and Vikashsheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief cum minister Mukesh Sahani have taken to the field to ensure the victory of the JD(U) nominees – Rajiv Singh in Tarapur and Aman Hazari in Kusheshwarsthan. They addressed public meetings in the two constituencies on Saturday also, while RCP and Lalan Singh have been doing the rounds of the two constituencies from before. As for the RJD, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is leading the campaign charge. After his three-day campaign in Tarapur, he moved to Kusheshwar Asthan on Friday, besides addressing a big rally there on Saturday. Among the Left parties, the CPI(ML) also organized joint rallies and meetings with the RJD on Saturday for the Kusheshwar Asthan seat. On Saturday, Tejashwi visited Kusheshswar temple and performed puja there. In Congress, Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mewani and Hardik Patel on Saturday left for Tarapur where they would campaign till October 25 and then move to Kusheshwar Asthan. The Congress candidates for the seats are Rajesh Mishra and Atirek Kumar, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/electioneering-gathers-pace-in-2-assembly-seats/articleshow/87230100.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Jaipur||Leopardess flees from Jhalana reserve, takes refuge in Moti Doongri foothills||Jaipur: A leopardess escaped from the Jhalana Forest Reserve and took refuge in Moti Doongri foothills on Saturday.Around 4pm, the leopardess was first spotted close to populated area near the Ganesh Mandir by a tourist. Following this, locals informed the forest officials. The forest department officials began a search to trace the leopardess after it reached the fort at Moti Doongri foothills. Forest officials said the leopardess chose the foothills as the private fort owned by the erstwhile royal family was surrounded by rich green vegetation and rocks. Jhalana ranger Janeshwar Chaudhary said, "Our team has installed trap cameras and cages in the area to safely rescue the animal." A local resident said the fort area was peaceful and had no visitors except staff members. The resident said, "However, the forest department has to rescue the animal soon as the area outside the fort is densely populated, including the Ganesh Temple.""There are two huge slums adjoining to the fort along with posh localities and government offices. If leopardess chooses to wander, it will be a big challenge to tranquilse it," said Bheem Singh, a resident of Sanjay Basti. As the leopardess, Pooja, could not be traced till late evening, the forest officials suspect that she might have ventured out. "The leopardess has made its territory near Smriti Van and forest area surrounding Rajasthan University campus. We are hoping the wild cat will return to forest at night," a forest official said.Leopards are known to stray into the city from the nearby Jhalana Forest Reserve. This is the third time in the last few years. On December 12 last year, a leopard entered the posh Kanota Bagh Colony on Takht E Shahi Road and SMS School. The Smriti Van on the JLN Marg had to be closed to public for weeks after a leopard was spotted and feared to be hiding in the area. Two years ago, a similar incident was reported at a residential area on the Jawaharlal Nehru Marg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/leopardess-flees-from-jhalana-reserve-takes-refuge-in-moti-doongri-foothills/articleshow/87231511.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid vaccination: At private centres, turnout drops heavily in October in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Once the driving force of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the city’s private vaccination centres have been witnessing a low turnout throughout October so far. While 66,366 people took the Covid-19 vaccine shot at private centres on September 3, the entire turnout for the October 18-23 week was 46,494 at private centres. On Saturday, 10,574 persons took the shot at private centres among a total 74,044 who took shots in the city. Although the BMC has started mobile centres in many wards, municipal officials and administrators of private hospitals acknowledge that the drive has been sluggish and hoped that it would pick up soon or “at least after Diwali”. Vaccine turnout has been uniformly low in the state, including in Mumbai’s public centres offering free vaccination. “It is possibly the festive season. Or the fear of Covid has lessened due to the decline in cases,” said a BMC official. The BMC has six lakh vaccine doses at the moment, and the private sector hospitals too have an equal number, if not more. “We had presumed that the turnout was low due to Navratri, when people fast, and expected it to pick up after Dasara, but that hasn’t happened,” the municipal official said. The turnout was between 45,000 and 60,000 for a week, about half or a third of the turnout on some August and September days. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the private sector has been mainly concentrating on drives sponsored through corporate social responsibility. Many hospitals such as Jaslok and Surana group of hospitals have joined hands with NGOs and corporate houses to vaccinate the slum pockets. Dr Prince Surana said vaccination has fallen due to the festive season and the fact that a sizeable number — over 97% — of the city’s adult population has already got the first shot. The turnout at his hospitals has been 5,050 in five days, while the CSR drives continue separately, he said. On Sunday, Dr Gautam Bhansali’s Golden Hour Foundation along with the BMC and Surana hospitals will take schoolchildren to Dharavi’s Kala Killa area to motivate residents to take the Covid shot. In the state, 5,48,842 took the shot on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-at-pvt-centres-turnout-drops-heavily-in-oct/articleshow/87231522.cms||---

Tanavade said that even if Sisodia comes and addresses press conferences in Goa, there will be no impact on BJP karyakartas as well as people of the state. “AAP is an opposition party and to remain in the limelight they make such statements.” “No political party takes a decision on leadership change three months before the elections. It may be happening in AAP and they must be changing,” he added. Apart from  preparedness, Tanavade said, the central leaders also discussed and finalised various committees for the upcoming elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bjp-no-change-in-cm-aap-is-a-party-of-lies/articleshow/87231020.cms||---

The high court had on September 1 stayed all further proceedings in the case registered against Prasad. However, he was arrested by Piduguralla police and later released on bail. Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy asked the police how they arrested the petitioner when there was a stay order on further proceedings. The police officers involved in the case should be ready to face the consequences in the contempt petition, the bench said. Notices have been issued to five police officers, including the inspector of Piduguralla police station. Cops had registered an FIR against Prasad under sections 153A, 504 and 505(2) of the IPC for reportedly forwarding an objectionable post on social media. The FIR was challenged before the high court, as none of the sections was applicable to the alleged crime. The court allowed his petition and stayed the FIR. The bench also directed the police not to take any coercive steps in the case. Despite the orders, he was arrested. After being released on bail, Prasad moved the high court again with a contempt petition. The counsel for the petitioner, Narra Srinivasa Rao, argued that even after showing the order copy of the high court, cops did not listen to them and arrested Prasad. Considering the arguments, Justice Roy said the matter will be taken up very seriously. He directed the police officials involved in the case to file affidavits within three weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-pulls-up-police-for-ignoring-order/articleshow/87229872.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Police identified the girl as Zoya Mallik based on the Aadhaar card recovered from her. An official said the girl had arrived here on Thursday to meet her friend who works at a spa in the city. “A masked man on a bike waylaid her near a service lane alongside Sitabari bus stand. The accused stabbed her multiple times before scurrying off in the same direction he had come from,” said an official. Zoya was rushed to hospital where she succumbed to injuries shortly before Friday midnight. A senior official informed TOI that Zoya was presently working in New Delhi and had come to Jaipur to meet her friend. “Zoya and her friend decided to take a tour of the city. They were returning home on Friday evening when the accused on the bike hit her with a sharp object, possibly a knife,” the official said, adding that Sanganer police contacted the girl’s relatives based on her Aadhaar card details. Police suspect that someone had followed Zoya all through the day and chose the bus stand as a final location to kill her. “The accused barreled through the service lane and took a quick U-turn after killing Zoya. He sped through the same lane and fled,” the official said, adding that CCTVs near the bus stand and at an intersection near Sanganer road are being examined to zero in on the accused. Police, however, did not reveal if the bike’s registration number were identified or not. “The matter is under investigation. We have spoken to the victim’s friend about how the entire incident transpired. Prima facie it appears that the accused attacked Zoya forcefully and she fell on the road, bleeding profusely,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/unknown-biker-stabs-pune-woman-to-death-in-sanganer/articleshow/87231523.cms||---
---||Thane||Mumbai: Worker dies 3 days after being locked inside gym||Kalyan: On Friday, a labour contractor was found hanging inside a gymnasium three days after the owner locked him and three others inside, demanding that they finish pending work before he let them out.  Bashir Shaikh, senior inspector of Kolsewadi police station said, “On the basis of the primary postmortem report, we have booked the gymnasium owner under abetment to suicide and for keeping them hostage.” The accused, Vaibhav Parab, allegedly locked the deceased contractor Poonma Chaudhari (24) and his three employees inside the under-construction gymnasium to complete the work in time for inauguration. At Poonma’s behest, the labourers Cholaram Chaudhari (22), Ramesh Chaudhari (22) and Gogaram Chaudhari (24) escaped through the window on the first day itself, police said. Poonma decided to stay back and complete the work. The labourers told the police that Parab had beaten up Poonma. They suspect that Poonma was killed. Kolsewadi police said the postmortem shows Poonma died by suicide. Cholaram, who is complainant in the case, said that Poonma had undertaken the furniture work of Fitness Empire Gymnasium. Parab demanded that the contractor return Rs 1 lakh that he had paid for the work. According to the police, Parab said he would recover the money by selling Poonma’s kidney. Cholaram said they did not inform anybody about the incident. On Friday evening, they learnt from the architect that Poonma was found hanging. Poonma’s kin on Saturday demanded that Parab be booked for murder. They refused to take the body and asked for a second autopsy at JJ Hospital, since the first one was done in Kalyan without informing them.  TOI tried to contact Parab, but his cell phone remained switched off.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/mumbai-worker-dies-3-days-after-being-locked-inside-gym/articleshow/87231817.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Cops tell buyers to be aware of risks in crowds||AHMEDABAD: Next time when you go out for Diwali shopping, be cautious and ensure that you take proper care of your belongings and any young children with you. This is the message that the city cops want to impress upon shoppers heedless of their surroundings. The city police have been carrying out the awareness drive in crowded places for the past couple of days. A similar drive was carried out by the city police in the Walled City, which is thronged by thousands, especially women. “It is not just the low middle income group, but even many well educated women from well to do families come to the Walled City for Diwali shopping, and hence in order to create awareness, women cops in civil dress posed as pickpockets and kidnappers. They found the shoppers so deeply engrossed in shopping that they were totally careless about their children or their purses,” said M M Laliwala, police inspector, Karanj. Officials who were part of the drive said that in one case, a women constable took a small kid some distance away from his mother who was totally unaware of the mock kidnapping. The officer said that when the women realised that her son was missing she ran from one place to another searching for him. Finally, the cops showed their identity card and handed over the kid after cautioning her. In another incident, a woman cop lifted the purse of a woman shopper. Once the operation was successful, another woman cop informed the shopper that the chain of her bag was opened. The woman realised that her purse was missing only after she was informed. She was given back the purse after being cautioned. The cops said that they have also increased surveillance in crowded places and are asking people to be alert. They added that while shopping one should ensure that bags are not on backs, as it becomes easy to pickpocket. Purse-lifting is on the rise, but as the amounts are usually small, most people do not come forward to lodge a complaint, cops said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cops-tell-buyers-to-be-aware-of-risks-in-crowds/articleshow/87230527.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Tigress Riddhi may not be shifted to Sariska Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: The proposal to shift young tigress T-124 named Riddhi to the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) is likely to be shelved as the big cat has paired up with a male tiger T-120. After the tigress was constantly engaged in territorial fights for dominance in the reserve, the forest department has mooted a plan to send the tigress to Sariska. Following this, the administration approached the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and sought a permission to relocate the tigress. An official at Ranthambore said, “The male tiger was sighted in the area and there are possibilities that T-124 have mated. In such scenario shifting the tigress is not a good idea.” In January, a proposal was floated after Riddhi suffered grievous injuries and received 14 stitches on the tongue. Riddhi had also killed the nine-month-old female cub of T-102. “Since long, no fighting has been witnessed and this has made forest department to reconsider the decision. There was a protest too from the tourism industry stakeholders for shifting a tigress from a main tourism zone of Ranthambore.” The Ranthambore administration proposal to relocate six young tigers, aged between 2.5 to 4 years, is also gathering dust. Three tigers and three tigresses were zeroed in for shifting and the proposal sent to the chief wildlife warden (CWLW). The list consisted of male tigers T-113, T-121 and T-123 and female tigers T-119, T-124 and T-126. A senior official at RNP said, “The decision will be taken at the state government’s level. Nothing can be done till the nod is not received.” Sources said, after receiving a proposal there was a divide between senior forest officials to shift the access tiger. “There was a view that tigers should not be shifted from Ranthambore fearing territorial fights. Territorial fights will always occur in nature and forest department should not intervene in the process,” said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tigress-riddhi-may-not-be-shifted-to-sariska/articleshow/87231513.cms||---

---||Delhi||Refugees from different countries camping outside the office of UNHCR to demand better future||New Delhi: For over a month now, the road in Vasant Vihar outside the office of the United Nation High Commission for Refugees has been home for Mahdi Basheer Hasan Al-Badri of Iraq. The 30-year-old’s beddings, bedsheets, blanket and pillow lie nearby. His two suitcases, filled with clothes and other belongings, stand in front of the barriers. To those who are willing to listen to him, the Iraqi refugee says, “I am forced to stay on the road because I have nowhere else to go.” Like Mahdi, refugees from Myanmar, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan have been living on the spot for the past many days, demanding from UNHCR a better future for themselves. Mahdi came to India with his 33-year-old brother, Mohammed Basheer, in 2014 after their father was kidnapped in Iraq’s Fallujah city. “Facing a threat to my life from my father’s kidnappers, my brother and I fled to India. We have lost contact with our family and don’t know about their condition now,” said Mahdi. The Iraqi earns what he can as a barber. “Due to my refugee status, it is difficult to find a job. Everyone asks me to show them my visa or Indian documents. I want citizenship in India or some other country,” said Mahdi, holding a placard saying his seven years in India has been a life wasted. A few metres away, 24-year-old Abdullah, a Rohingya, has put up a portable bed fitted with a mosquito net. It’s been 23 days of sleeping on the street. The Class X student of National Institute of Open Schooling came to Delhi around three years ago to escape communal violence in Myanmar. “My single mother, who used to work as a domestic help there, asked me to leave Myanmar,” the youngster said. Abdullah wants UNHCR will resettle him in another country. ““Though I have a refugee card, I am still considered an illegal immigrant in India,” he said. “My mother’s health has deteriorated and she is unable to work and send me money. I don’t have enough even for two meals a day. I will move from this spot only when UNHCR relocates me somewhere.” Noor Agha spent three days and nights with his six children on the road. “It proved tough to live here, so on Wednesday I asked my children to return to our rented room in Wazirabad,” said Agha, who came from Afghanistan in 1993. “However, I will continue to protest here till my demand for resettlement in a third country is met.” The Afghan said he had spent his life as a refugee but wanted a brighter future for his six children aged between nine and 20 years. For many days now, three refugees from Sudan too have been living on the Vasant Vihar road. Abualqassim Ahmed Mohamed Adam, 35, claimed to be homeless and wanted to leave India. A few others are camping here to demand medical and financial assistance from UNHCR. Wilo Ali Abdi of Somalia and her two sons, aged 10 and eight years, have been sitting outside the office for three days. In a glum tone, she said, “I am suffering from asthma and gall bladder disease and my doctor has advised surgery. I dread to think of what will happen to my kids if something goes wrong. That is why I want UNHCR help.” Her 10-year-old son Abdullah, a Class VI student at a government school, mumbled he was unable to sleep because of his mother’s condition. An UNHCR official responded, “Resettlement involves the transfer of refugees from an asylum country, i.e. not from their origin country, to another country that has agreed to admit them and ultimately grants them permanent residence. This process depends on a series of interviews, checks and clearances by resettlement countries. These take time, often up to several years. Less than 1% of refugees are currently resettled globally due to the limited opportunities. For this reason, only the most vulnerable refugees are prioritised for resettlement.” The official added, “For confidentiality and protection of refugees, we are not in a position to give information on the details of individual cases.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/refugees-from-different-countries-camping-outside-the-office-of-unhcr-to-demand-better-future/articleshow/87231576.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The campaign should end at 7 pm on the day, chief electoral officer K Vijayanand said. The by-election is scheduled to be held on October 30. The ruling YSRC, BJP and the Congress are the main contesting parties, apart from a number of registered parties and independents. In all, 15 candidates are contesting the by-election, which was necessitated by the death of YSRC MLA Dr Venkata Subbaiah. The YSRC is fielding the deceased MLA’s widow Dasari Sudha, following which the TDP and Jana Sena withdrew from the contest. Meanwhile, the BJP is pulling out all stops to woo voters and prove its presence in the state through this by-election. BJP leaders are in constant touch with the Jana Sena and TDP leaders in the constituency, seeking their support. The Congress is fielding former MLA Kamalamma. Sources say she is also in constant touch with the local TDP leaders, who are likely to back her this time. The TDP top leadership is not interested in supporting the BJP and have it increase its vote share in the state, and plans to support the Congress candidate instead. The YSRC is leaving no stone unturned to retain the seat and get a majority of at least one lakh votes. Party top leaders and several ministers are camping in the constituency, monitoring the campaign process.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/campaign-for-badvel-bypoll-to-end-on-oct-27/articleshow/87229880.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||Women get ready to celebrate Karwa Chauth in style||KOLKATA: A women’s weekend started on Saturday as Punjabi, Marwari, UP-ite, and Bihari women geared up to celebrate Karwa Chauth in style. While the celebrations would start at the crack of dawn on Sunday and end with the sighting of the moon in the evening, for some communities like the Punjabis, Saturday was celebrated as Sargi Meet, which is done on the eve of Karwa Chauth to usher in the festivities. Karwa Chauth is a festival of married women on the fourth day after Purnima in the month of Kartik, when they keep a vrat to pray for the wellbeing of their husbands. After moon is sighted in the evening, these vratees look at their husband’s faces and then break their day long fast. Some women don’t even drink water the whole day. They dress up in their fineries and wear mehendi in big groups. On Saturday a large number of Punjabi women gathered at the Punjab Bhavan for mehendi, songs and dance for a special Sargi Meet that was organised by Punjabi Bradree. “Last year we had planned one but the Covid spoilt it all. This time everyone is doubly vaccinated so we arranged this favourite ladies event on the eve of the Karwa Chauth,” said Akash Bhatia, president of the Bradree. Right from newly- weds who were there to usher in their first Karwa Chauth to those who had been celebrating for over two decades, women met for mehendi, which was a high point of the event and then broke into their favourite songs and dances. Each participant was given a Sargi box that contained all the necessary items for the puja. The newly-weds were blessed with special gifts. “It was such a relief to be able to dress up specially for the Sargi event once again and come for a physical event. We were all so tired of meeting each other virtually,” said Rachna Virmani, a participant. This was echoed by Vritti Khosla, happy that she could once again sing and dance with her friends physically. In most Marwari households, the celebrations have started and married women have gathered together to put on elaborate mehendi. They said that this was missing last year as no one was visiting anyone and distance was the keywork. While many have called in mehendiwalas home, there are some who have booked appointments with mehendiwalas in different malls. Special arrangements were made in different malls so that mehendi walas could work till late in the night as the queue was big and many waited patiently for their turn maintaining distance. “I am so happy that this time it’s a Sunday. As an investment consultant I keep working throughout the day. But this time I can have a relaxed an enjoyable Karwa Chauth. I utilised Saturday to wear the mehendi and put on my pre-Karwa Chauth clothes,” said Vineeta Agrawal. Though Karwa Chauth is not a typically Gujarati festival, a large number of women in Bhowanipore, influenced by their Marwari friends have been celebrating for years. One such is Usha Popat who is keeping vrat for 25 years now. “This year we have been able to breathe easy at least. Last year we were all cooped up at home and could not meet anyone,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/women-get-ready-to-celebrate-karwa-chauth-in-style/articleshow/87230532.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Hospital told to pay Rs 5 lakh to patient’s kin||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered Apollo Hospitals International Ltd and an insurance company to pay Rs 5 lakh to the relatives of a patient who passed away due to post-operative complications. The patient had undergone a coronary artery bypass surgery. In October 2013, a retired executive of Food Corporation of India, P C Sukumaran, was admitted to the hospital, located in Ahmedabad’s Bhat area, for coronary artery bypass grafting. Post-operative complications arose and he was diagnosed with severe infection and he died due to those complications. Sukumaran’s widow and two sons sued the hospital and Reliance General Insurance Company and demanded compensation alleging deficiency in service on part of the doctors and the hospital staff. They claimed that the patient lost his life due to the non-availability of proper treatment, for want of timely diagnosis, and sheer negligence and carelessness on part of the hospital. They demanded a compensation of Rs 23 lakh under various heads. The hospital management, on the other hand, refuted the allegations and asserted that all required attention and treatment was provided to the patient. After hearing the case, the commission’s judicial member M J Mehta came to the conclusion that there was deficiency in performing duties on part of the hospital staff and the patient passed away as a result. The order was delivered on October 13.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hospital-told-to-pay-rs-5l-to-patients-kin/articleshow/87230534.cms||---

This is an extension of the previous day’s order. The decision was taken to curb the spread of fake news, rumours about untoward incidents and paper leakage, which may result in a law-and-order situation and disturbance in public peace, it stated. The divisional commissioner cited prevention of cheating and rigging as major reasons behind clampdown on 2G/3G/4G data (mobile internet), bulk SMS, MMS and social media services. Exceptions have been made for voice calls and broadband internet. The order has been issued as per Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules-2017. Meanwhile, of the 7.85 lakh registered candidates for the first day of patwari recruitment exam on Saturday, 65.11 per cent candidates appeared for the exam across 1,170 centres on Saturday, said chairman of Rajasthan Staff Selection Board (RSSB) Hari Prasad Sharma.

---||Vijayawada||‘India should be ready to meet challenges that follow 2nd wave’||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Medical College, which is hosting weekly webinars to confront the challenges posed by the pandemic, had at one point, headed by principal Dr P V Sudhakar, held daily webinars with a focus on doctors involved in Covid-19 response. An alumnus of AMC, Dr Sridhar Chilimuri, who is physician-in-chief and chairman of the department of medicine at BronxCare Hospital Center in New York, is one of the key persons in organising the webinars. Speaking to STOI, Dr Sridhar said it is important to recognise that microbes like the coronavirus survive by exchange of genetic material, while humans survive by exchange of knowledge. “This is the purpose of hosting Covid-19 seminars. When the pandemic first emerged in New York, the impact was enormous. However, we got in touch with physicians in Italy, who shared valuable information in managing patients,” said Dr Sridhar. Asked about the anticipated third wave, Dr Sridhar said “If no new variant emerges, India is unlikely to have a significant third wave as long as we continue vaccinating as many as possible. While vaccines prevent serious illness, masks and social distancing are still key to prevent transmission of infections. Vaccines, masks and judicious social distancing will be the only way to end the pandemic,” said Dr Sridhar. “However, India has to prepare for other challenges that follow the second wave. This would include care of patients with non-Covid medical illnesses. Many individuals have postponed or avoided hospitals and clinics for the past one year. Gearing up the healthcare system, which is already under enormous stress, will be the next challenge for India,” added Dr Sridhar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/india-should-be-ready-to-meet-challenges-that-follow-2nd-wave/articleshow/87229894.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The constable, Amit Gosavi, had been booked by the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) for accepting a bribe on October 13. The sub-inspector was suspended as Gosavi worked under his direct supervision. The police did not disclose his identity. According to the ACB, Gosavi, 43, had demanded a bribe of Rs 5000 per month from a lottery shop owner. The lottery shop was shut for the past year-and-a-half due to lockdown. When restrictions were lifted, the shop owner decided to resume his business. “When Gosavi found out, he visited the shop in August and met the shop owner. He told the shop owner that if he wished to resume business and wanted it to run smoothly, then he should pay a bribe of Rs 5 000 per month,” said an ACB officer. The frightened shopowner paid up Rs 3500 on August 25 but Gosavi kept badgering him for the rest of the sum. On September 13, the shopowner approached ACB and lodged a complaint. The ACB verified his complaint and laid a trap on October 13.

---||Kolkata||10 West Bengal trekkers dead, six missing||KOLKATA: The state government is making efforts to bring back bodies of 10 trekkers from Bengal who were killed in an avalanche in Uttarakhand. At least six others are missing. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has asked officials to keep in touch with Uttarakhand administration so that the bodies can be flown back at the earliest. The state is also making arrangements to help the 150-odd tourists stranded in Uttarakhand return home when the weather improves. Among the deceased trekkers who had gone on the expedition on the Harsil-Chitkul route were Thakupukur’s Sadhan Basak (63), Shibayan Das (28), Pritam Roy (22), Sagar De (27), Chandra Sekhar Das (34) and Sarit Sekhar Das (35). Baruipur’s Richard Mandal (30), Saurav Ghosh (32), Bikash Makal (45) and Tanumay Tiwari (34), part of a group of six from Nepalganj in South 24 Parganas, were also reported dead. But Uttarakhand police are yet to get information on another team member, Sukhen Maji. A search and rescue team of the ITBP has found the bodies of two trekkers along the Harsil-Chitkul trek in Himachal Pradesh; of them, one is reportedly from Bengal but any details on the other one is yet to be released. Another group of six trekkers, including five from Bengal, have been missing from the Sunderdhunga Glacier of Bageshwar in Uttarakhand. A porter, who survived, said the others in the group had been buried under the snow but there was no official confirmation on the deaths yet. Kalighat’s Shibayan Das left on October 11 for the Chitkul-Harsil route. He had called his brother, Subhojit, on October 14 to say he would climb to a higher altitude the next day and would be out of cellphone network. “He had joined a group of trekkers there whom we don’t know. They were supposed to climb down to a lower altitude by October 22. But the avalanche ended everything,” said Subhojit. Shibayan had been on similar expeditions at least five times.  Basak from Thakurpukur went missing in the blizzard near Lamkhaga lake. Basak, a veteran trekker, had joined four friends from Howrah and Nadia, all of whom are missing. He left the city on October 10 last spoke to the family on October 11. They got the news of his death from Nabanna. The family said the Uttarakhand administration had them all five of the team were missing. “Nothing has yet been confirmed. We contacted the guide’s family and learnt five bodies—including that of my father—were brought to Bagheswar. I urge the administration to bring the bodies back,” Basak’s daughter said. Haridebpur’s Tiwari, who was part of the Nepalganj team, was a regular trekker and left for the expedition with the others on October 12. His family had urged him not to go on the trek this year without being sure of the weather. He last spoke to his family on October 14. Among the team, no information has been found about Maji. Maji’s wife Laboni said the family had asked him not to join the trek. “But he ignored it and left on October 12. They had gone to Uttarakashi and were supposed to trek to Harsil, when they were caught in the avalanche,” she said. Bishnupur MLA Dilip Mandal said arrangements were on to get the bodies by Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/10-bengal-trekkers-dead-six-missing/articleshow/87230553.cms||Debobrata Shome
---||Pune||Pune: PMC authorities claim 100% coverage with at least 1 dose||PUNE: Health authorities have claimed of vaccinating 100% of the target population in the Pune municipal limits with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccines, while 59% of the total beneficiaries have received both the doses so far. Data with the district health authorities showed that more than 31.57 lakh people in the PMC limits have received at least one dose of the vaccine till October 20 as compared to the target population of over 30 lakh. Based on this data, the civic health authorities claimed of vaccinating 105% of the eligible population with at least one dose so far. “As per an earlier communication from the Centre and the state government, Pune city has a target adult population of nearly 26.40 lakh. But PMC has already crossed this figure with 31.57 lakh first doses being administered so far. If we go by these estimates, Pune city has already covered 119% of the population with at least one dose,” a PMC official said. In another communication, the state authorities estimated Pune city’s eligible population to be around 30 lakh, as per which, the first dose target so far achieved is 105% (of population). Suryakant Deokar, chief immunization officer, PMC, told TOI, “As per estimates provided by the state government on the population size of Pune municipal limits, we have already achieved first dose vaccination of at least 100% of the city’s population. Minor differences in these estimates may arise when we consider the floating population in the city as well as those who may have come from other parts of the district to the city to get their first doses. However, these differences are insignificant as we have already touched 105% population mark with respect to first doses.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that most adults in PMC limits have now taken at least dose one of the vaccines. On cross-verification of the data with electoral roll, Dr Deshmukh said this would be done soon. In Pune district, 92% adults have received at least one dose, while nearly half of the district population (49%) is now fully vaccinated, as per October 20 data from the district health department. “By October-end, we aim to complete first dose of the remaining beneficiaries in Pune district. Nearly 6-10 lakh beneficiaries are yet to get their first Covid vaccine dose in the district, which should be done by month-end via mission Kavach Kundal and Mission Yuva Swasth Abhiyaan. The latter is a special-focus immunization drive for eligible students across college campuses,” said Dr Deshmukh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-authorities-claim-100-coverage-with-at-least-1-dose/articleshow/87230567.cms||Neha Madaan

During the recent raids, authorities found that the traders were freely adulterating biryani with prohibited food colours and reprocessed oils which are carcinogenic. Following a number of complaints from the biryani lovers, FSSAI officials conducted a series of raids at the biryani hotels and wayside eateries in the city and also in tier-two cities like Gudivada, Machilipatnam, and Vuyyuru in Krishna district. Officials found that the eateries were using adulterated oil and cheap quality ingredients. “Biryani makers are using cheap quality spices to supply the dish at cheaper rates in price competition. Vanaspati is used as an alternative to ghee and prohibited food colours are used to decorate the dish. Reprocessed edible oils are very dangerous and they are used widely,” said Poornachandra Rao, assistant food controller . Most of these ingredients are carcinogenic in nature and also damage the digestive system. It is advised to skip these dishes, Rao urged. He asked the biryani lovers to complain to food safety authorities about the poor quality food supplied at eateries. Officials seized huge quantities of biryani and fried chicken at Machilipatnam and sent the samples for testing. Meanwhile, the veterinary wing of VMC issued notices to 21 eateries in the last one month and is heading to cancel their trade licences.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/fssai-experts-warn-of-adulterated-biryani/articleshow/87229905.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: 3 kids forsaken by runaway mother reunited with father||RAJKOT: The curious case of three minor siblings wallowing in apathy finally reached the police, who took the cudgels to locate their father and send them with him to Junagadh. It all began with the children’s cupid-struck runaway mother who came to Rajkot to live with her lover, who she had met online, abandoning 15 years of married life. She, however, carted her three children — two sons and one daughter — along with her in the amorous escapade, but only to push them to a life of misery with her apathetic attitude. They neglected the children who did not even have enough food to feed themselves and had to beg from neighbours. The neighbours gave them food for a few days at first, but when the misery continued, they somehow managed to dig out contact details of the children’s father and informed him about their plight. The father who ekes a living as a labourer in Junagadh then approached DySP Pradeepsinh Jadeja there seeking help to bring back his children. Jadeja sought Rajkot’s university police station help to solve this peculiar issue. “The girl was the eldest among three siblings, and whenever her two younger brothers got hungry she would beg food from her neighbours. Her mother returned home late in the night and left early in the morning. While such matters fall under Rajkot police’s jurisdiction, the plight of three young kids forced me to request specific city police station to help them,” Jadeja told TOI on Saturday. University police station inspector SS Chavda and sub inspector Arvindsinh Jadeja summoned the woman along with her three children. The children described their ordeal to the police and also expressed desire to go return home in Junagadh with their father. The police also tried counselling the mother, who, however, refused to go back with her husband. The children happily reunited with their father.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/three-kids-neglected-by-runaway-mother-finally-reunited-with-father/articleshow/87229910.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Uddhav Thackeray expresses concern over misuse of central agencies||AURANGABAD: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday expressed concerns over the misuse of central agencies and, without naming former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh, said, “We have a case wherein the complainant has gone missing, however, the case is still going on. After making allegations, he has gone missing. We are being hounded, harassed, different inquiries are going on, and raids are being carried out. Time has come to put a full stop on such practices.” Thackeray said the Constitution has clearly defined the rights and powers of the state, as well as, the central government. “Is the central government above the state? While drafting the Constitution, the issue had been raised before Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. In response, Dr Ambedkar had said that except a handful of things, states will have their rights.” “If we do not want to lose our freedom and end up being ruled again, I appeal to all the legal authorities, led by the Chief Justice of India, to guide the nation on the true meaning of freedom. Who has what rights? If a person is holding a particular post, his whims and fancies cannot be his right. Someone should take a lead here and tell the concerned person that rights and power are different from individual whims and fancies,” said Thackeray. Thackeray spoke to the media during a function held to inaugurate two wings of the annex building of the Bombay high court bench in Aurangabad in the presence of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justices Uday Lalit, DY Chandrachud, BR Gavai, AS Oka, Bombay high court Chief Justice Dipanka Datta, Union law and justice minister Kiren Rijiju, and other high court Justices. Referring to the statements made by the Justices who spoke before him, Thackeray said, “Delivering justice is not an individual’s responsibility, it is a teamwork. The ceiling of democracy rests on the four pillars and these pillars must ensure delivery of justice.” The CM further said, “If even one of these pillars succumbs to pressure, the entire roof of democracy will collapse, irrespective of how many pillars we put in place later.” He added that these four pillars need to come together and try to make a crime-free society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/uddhav-expresses-concern-over-misuse-of-central-agencies/articleshow/87229268.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||Can’t go home, Afghan students wait for JNU reply on PhD seats||NEW DELHI: A group of Afghan students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), who had appealed to the varsity administration to allot supernumerary seats for Afghan nationals for PhD courses, said that the authorities had not responded yet to the request. The students completed their postgraduation this year from JNU and said that due to the prevailing circumstances, they were unable to return to Afghanistan. They urged the varsity administration to ease the process for PhD admissions. Times ViewConsidering the political state of affairs back home, it is understandable that Afghan students are going through an extraordinary crisis in their lives. The university must take a sympathetic view of their plight and do whatever is possible to help them.Earlier this month, the group of students had written to vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar and other officials requesting the allotment of supernumerary seats for Afghan nationals under the foreign students’ quota. Stating that the prevailing situation in Afghanistan was not conducive to their return, the students said that they were staring at an uncertain future. Mohammad Shafiq, one of the Afghan students who completed his post-graduation in international relations from JNU, said, “We have tried to approach all kinds of authorities and officials, but have not managed to even get five minutes of their time. I do not know how we are going to manage. Even though we appeared for the entrance exam, we were told that there were no seats for us.” Stating that their counterparts in other central universities managed to secure seats in their respective varsities, Shafiq added, “All other state and central universities in coordination with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) have promoted their terminal students to PhD programmes. Why can’t we be accommodated in a similar manner?” In their letter to the university administration, the students had said, “Due to the uncertain and deteriorating situation in the country and based on humanitarian grounds, we sincerely request the VC of JNU to ease the process of getting admission by providing quotas, cutoffs or any possible way for Afghan students.” While reiterating the possibility of imminent threats back home, Shafiq added, “Our lives are in danger if we are to return to Afghanistan. While I have not spoken to my family in the last two months, some of those who I was in touch with said that it’s better for us to live on Delhi’s streets rather than return to our country.” The university administration did not respond to calls or messages regarding queries on the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cant-go-home-afghan-students-wait-for-jnu-reply-on-phd-seats/articleshow/87231595.cms||---

Udhav Doke, the chairperson of Laxmi Vishnupuram Society, said effective contact tracing kept the case count below 25 in the society. “When we came to know about any infected resident, we immediately got their details and checked for the people who may have come their contact to alert them. We even used our CCTV cameras for tracing,” Doke said. The housing complex has over 250 flats and around 600 residents. Society committee member Sunil Bacchav said necessary help, such as supply of milk, groceries, vegetables and medicines, was extended to the residents in home quarantine. During the first lockdown in 2020, the society gate stayed closed for nearly three months. “Except close relatives, no one was allowed inside. We didn’t even allow some of the flat owners wanting to shift from their previous residences,” said Dattatreya Mundalik, a senior society member. One of the society members owns a vegetable stall and was requested him to set up shop on the premises. He agreed and supplied vegetables, bakery and other items. Another society member, Nirmala Dhamanikar, said during the lockdown, many residents prepared kits for the security guards and conservancy staffers. “We cooked and delivered food packets to those in need in different parts of the city,” said Dhamanikar. Resident Sachi Raut said many people also sanitised the common areas regularly. Member Gokul Waykar said when there was a shortage of beds in hospitals, residents tried their best to help arrange for medical support for society patients. “And most importantly, residents testing positive were provided with full support,” said Waykar. Fusion City Society secretary Vinod Salunkhe said the club house was converted into a department store. “We requested a city-based departmental store to come to our society and they set up their facility at the club house,” said Salunkhe. According to Salunkhe, the society has three wings with 250 flats. “Due to the precautions we took, the number of the positive patients in the society did not cross 20,” he said. Society treasurer Robert Patrick said if any member tested positive, their family members were told to send a message to the committee about their requirements “We would keep essentials at their doorstep. We also dedicated a separate elevator for Covid-19 patients,” said Patrick. Committee member Imran Shaikh said the temperature checking equipment was provided to the security guards. Shaikh highlighted the contribution of the security guards and housekeeping staff, calling them the real ‘corona warriors’. “We felicitated them for their efforts,” Shaikh said. Senior citizens had a tough time as they could not got out for walk. “For three months, we were at home. We knew it was for our safety,” said Aba More, a senior member of the society. Salunkhe said the Kondhve-Dhavade gram panchayat also provided help. He said the society later tied up with hospitals and got maximum residents vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/lockdowns-support-systems-help-two-societies-keep-infections-down/articleshow/87230585.cms||---

Earlier, no one wanted to send their kids to government schools. Now, they are excelling and scoring over 90% in their exams,” Kejriwal said during a ‘pratibha samman sammaroh’ organised by the Delhi government on Saturday as part of the celebration of Prakatosav of Maharishi Valmiki at Thyagaraj Stadium. “Both BR Ambedkar and Lord Valmiki teach us that the only way to be successful, to flourish, is through education.

Police are probing if the murder was the fallout of a robbery bid. The family of the deceased claim that the attackers took away the man’s money, rings and phone after stabbing him. In a PCR call, a man informed the police on Friday that his brother had been stabbed. The victim, Manoj, was rushed to a hospital where he was declared brought dead with a stab injury on the left side of his abdomen. “A case of murder and robbery was registered,” a police officer said. Manoj’s family said that he worked as an electrician and was returning home from Wazir Nagar on Friday. His brother Bablu said that Manoj called his wife Seema and said he was 10 mins away from home. “They had planned to go Diwali shopping once he reached home,” Bablu said. After around 15 mins, another brother Mukesh was informed by a local that Manoj was injured and lying on the road. “Mukesh ran to the spot and found his bleeding body,” said Bablu. The family claims a group of people attacked Manoj and snatched his money, rings and phone and he was stabbed in the melee. “No one came to his help. Even though he was injured, he tried to chase his attackers but they managed to flee,” the family said.  “A rickshaw driver even pushed him instead of helping.” Bablu claimed that Mukesh even asked a passing PCR van for help but was refused. “They told him to take our brother in a rickshaw,” he alleged. However, deputy commissioner of police (Central) Shweta Chauhan denied the allegation and said no such thing was reported. She further said, “We have got some vital leads and raids are being conducted to nab the accused.” The family claimed Manoj’s phone, rings and money are missing, but police said only his phone was gone. “There is no clarity about the money and rings. We are investigating the matter,” the officer said. Manoj is survived by his wife and two children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/42-year-old-stabbed-to-death-near-home-cops-suspect-robbery-bid/articleshow/87231599.cms||---

He said that there was cause for introspection and self- reflection. “While sitting in the SC, we come across the extent of justice and injustice all over the country. A convict, who has been in prison for 35 years, and not been released, an undertrial who has been in jail for 12 years without even charges being framed against him. These are some of the realities of Indian judicial system that we have to confront,” he said. Talking about Maharashtra, he said that there are 48.23 lakh cases pending as of date. Of these, 21,718 cases are over 30 years old. “The oldest case is from Sangola taluka, in which the accused has been absconding since 1958.” He added that 16,474 cases have been stayed by the Bombay HC. “There is a special darkhast of 1958, which is pending before civil judge senior division Ratnagiri in which a stay was granted by the Bombay HC in second appeal in 2008.” Speaking about improving the justice delivery system through means of digitisation, Justice Chandrachud said that under ‘the inter-operable criminal justice system, we are linking every aspect of the criminal justice system, namely the prisons, the courts, police stations and the forensic laboratories. It is part of our vision three document.” Citing a recent letter he has written to all the Chief Justices of High Court in India, he said that government is the largest litigant and that by January 2022 all the cases of the Union government and the state governments should be e-filed in district and HC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/48l-cases-pending-in-maha-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/87229315.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Crisis of single donor platelet kits in private hospitals, blood banks||JAIPUR: The spike in dengue and cases of dengue-like illnesses in the city has pushed up the demand for platelets. The blood banks are facing acute shortage of kits used in machines for preparing single donor platelets (SDPs), which are transfused into the patients. Government hospitals and several private blood banks are also facing the same situation, as the demand has gone up and vendors are unavailable to meet the demand. Several patients have donors but they are struggling to find the blood banks where kits for SDPs are available. A source from a government-run hospital said that SDPs will not be possible in the hospital as the kits are not available. Patients’ attendants will be asked to arrange it from outside the hospital. Besides, SMS Hospital has also restricted their SDPs for government-run hospitals only as the priority of the SMS Hospital is on fulfilling the requirements of the hospitals attached to the SMS Medical College. Besides, hands of local vendors of SDP kits are tight as they are not receiving the SDP kits according to the requirement. “We supply the SDP kits to the hospitals as we receive it from the companies,” said a local vendor. Sources in government hospitals said that the kits are imported from Europe and the US. The sources said that the machines which use European kits are facing difficulties as they are in short supply, while the machines using the kits from the US are operational but they are receiving the kits not in accordance with the demand. The kits are now being imported by flight. However, the vendors are hopeful that the situation will improve in coming days. Even the private blood banks are facing crisis of SDP kits. Official of one of the biggest private banks said, the demand has gone up for platelets significantly, but kits are not available in accordance with the demand. At SMS Hospital, amid rise in dengue cases and dengue-like illness cases, the demand for Random Donor platelets (RDP) has gone up from 40-60 units to 150-200 units daily. While in normal days, 3-5 SDPs were reported but as cases of dengue and dengue-like illnesses go up, it has gone up to 25-30 units daily. SMS Hospital’s senior professor and head of the department (transfusion medicine) Dr Amit Sharma said, “Attendants of the patients should not panic seeing their patient’s platelets falling. What is recommended for SDP transfusion in dengue patient is that when the platelet count falls below 10,000 or if it falls below 30,000 with bleeding, the platelet should be transfused.” Not only Jaipur, but other districts of the state are also witnessing a spread of dengue. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had recently reviewed the situation around dengue and seasonal diseases, and had directed the officials to take measures to prevent their spread.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/crisis-of-single-donor-platelet-kits-in-pvt-hosps-blood-banks/articleshow/87231600.cms||---

---||Pune||Covid-19: ICMR and task force stress on completing adult vaccination||PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and national task force members have said that the country should focus on completing adult population vaccination rather than booster doses. Senior scientist and head of the ICMRs epidemiology and communicable diseases division Dr Samiran Panda on Saturday told TOI that even as there are discussions on booster doses, completion of schedule of the two doses of currently administered intramuscular injection preparation of covid vaccines under the ongoing immunisation programme will yield the necessary protection against the advancement of infection or severe form of the disease that may require hospitalization. "The priority should be to complete both doses for the eligible adults first and then planning for children can be firmed up through critical analysis of age group and comorbidities,''said Dr Panda. With the country having touched 1 billion covid 19 vaccine doses on Thursday, he said the way forward for the country is to continue scaling up vaccination and following covid protocols. The ICMR scientist said that while the vaccines are disease-modifying vaccines and do not offer protection against the acquisition of infection, so use of a mask to prevent the occurrence of infection is a must for both vaccinated and the unvaccinated. On the way ahead he said that a combination of prevention against disease severity and acquisition of infection with the help of vaccines and correct as well as consistent use of masks should be the programme emphasis now. "From a public health perspective this is the need of the hour and the priority should be to complete both doses for the eligible adults first,'' he stressed. He said that besides this the planning and programmatic steps as pertinent to children and vaccination can be firmed up through critical analysis such as which age group to cover first, he said ruling out boosters Member of the national task force and National Task Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) covid task force chairman Dr NK Arora told TOI that the country should continue to focus on completing adult population vaccination immediately followed by kids vaccination. "Booster doses are not our priority now,'' he said. However eminent virologist and former professor of clinical virology CMC Vellore Dr T Jacob John explains that the overall purpose of rolling out vaccination to the general population since January 16 was to convert or transition the epidemic phase to the endemic phase.  "This transition occurred on June 27 and for the last 17 consecutive weeks, the transmission is endemic. Week after week the daily numbers are slowly declining. From June 27 the cases have been less than 50,000, from September 9, the cases reduced below 40,000 and from September 24 onwards the cases further plummeted below 30,000 and from October 9 the cases are below 20,000. These being the daily numbers we can say that for the last four months the stage is already an endemic stage. Now with this purpose achieved, the next goal for the country is to minimise breakthrough infections in those who are vulnerable to severe disease and hospitalisation and death when infected," he explained. He feels that all such persons ought to be offered a booster dose, especially senior citizens who have taken both the doses and are prone to breakthrough infections should be given booster doses. The virologist feels that while studies may continue on booster doses, those given booster doses can be made study subjects. "From hospital records of severe disease, we can classify them as two-dose and no booster dose versus booster dose received.  "Studies in other countries confirm the need and effectiveness of booster doses_mostly with mRNA vaccines. He said that the government should announce such a policy and direct all seniors and those with medical conditions for such booster doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/icmr-task-force-stress-on-completing-adult-vaccination/articleshow/87230591.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||Sent proposal to set up National Judicial Infrastructure Authority: CJI N V Ramana||AURANGABAD: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Saturday said he had sent a proposal to the law ministry for the establishment of the National Judicial Infrastructure Authority. He urged Union law minister Kiren Rijiju to take it up as early as the winter session of Parliament. Ramana was speaking during his maiden visit to the Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad for an event that was attended by Rijiju and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Ramana pitched for the need to improve infrastructure in judicial buildings as well as filling up of vacant posts in courts across the country. He said that good judicial infrastructure in India has always been an afterthought because of the mindset that the courts operate from dilapidated buildings. He added that judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice, adding that it is baffling that improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is being carried out in an ad-hoc and unplanned manner. “If we want a different outcome from the judicial system, we cannot continue to work in the current circumstances. An integral aspect in this regard is financial autonomy. I have, therefore, sent a proposal for the establishment of the National Judicial Infrastructure Authority to the ministry. I am expecting a positive response as early as during the winter session of Parliament,” he said. The CJI said, “People’s faith in the judiciary is the biggest strength of a democracy. Courts are essential for the societies governed by law. Courts buildings are not structures made of mortar and bricks. They actively assure the constitutional guarantees of right to justice. The seekers of justice should not worry about the might of the state.” He observed that generally it is a common notion that only criminals or victims visit the court. “People take pride in stating that they have never visited the court in their lifetime. It is high time we make efforts to remove the taboo associated with approaching courts for affirmation of rights,” he said. During his keynote address, Ramana also said that the total sanctioned strength of judicial officials in the country is 24,280 and number of court premises is 20,143, including 620 rental premises. About 26% court complexes in the country do not have separate toilets for women, 16% do not have toilets even for men. Only 54% have pure drinking water facilities, while only 5% have basic medical facilities.” Spread over 57 acres, the hight court at Aurangabad is the most spacious and contemporary in the country, said the CJI. Citing an internal report from 2018, the CJI said, “Failure to deliver timely justice has cost 9% of country’s GDP. Moreover, the impact of under-supported judiciary is also seen in foreign investment.” Union law minister Kiren Rijiju said that common man should not have to struggle to get justice. While confiding that there are constraints, difficulties and limitations, he said that the central government is working to make the judiciary robust. “During the last Cabinet meeting, a decision to sanction Rs 9,000 crore for development of lower judiciary has been taken. Some monetary provisions for constructing Gram Nyayalay, judiciary at the lowest level, have also been made.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/sent-proposal-to-set-up-national-judicial-infrastructure-authority-cji/articleshow/87229308.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Maharashtra: In 45-plus category, only 44% completely vaccinated against Covid-19||PUNE: Only 44% people in the 45-plus age group were completely vaccinated against Covid-19 in Maharashtra till Friday though a total of 9.45 crore doses had been administered, the state public health department data revealed. With the centre stressing on second dose beneficiaries, the state plans to stress on completing the senior citizens category vaccination at the earliest, stated public health officials "We have 2.65 cr (75.58%) beneficiaries who have taken their first dose in the age group of 45 plu while 1.56 crore (44.48%) are fully vaccinated beneficiaries in the age group. We will focus on completing the second dose at the earliest for this age group according to the direction of the centre,'' shared state immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai. With this age group being the most vulnerable the stress will be to ensure the double-dose vaccination of these beneficiaries at the earliest, he said. On Friday, state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in his weekly covid review meeting said that the breakthrough infections among senior citizens was of concern. With the overall breakthrough infections after first dose being 0.19% after the first dose and 0.26% after the second dose and the maximum number of cases being reported above 60-65 years of age, this was of concern, he stated. Experts have also stated that breakthrough infections are noticed across the country. Senior epidemiologist of ICMR Dr. Samiran Panda said that because most of the senior citizens have completed two doses of vaccination and breakthrough infections by definition are those which occur after completion vaccination, the sheer number of vaccine recipients with the completed schedule is more among senior citizens and probability of reported breakthrough infections from within this group is greater. "However, the occurrence of breakthrough infection has got nothing to do with seniority and it takes place when anyone lowers their mask down and comes in close proximity to infected individuals during a social, political, or religious gathering or during the time of festivities,'' shared Dr Panda. With the state nearing 10 crore vaccinations which is 10% of the country's total vaccination, the state is also leading in the country_ with the highest tally of completely vaccinated persons of 2.93 crore population. The centre on Saturday had a video conference with all the states and have issued specific directions to speed up second dose vaccinations at the earliest State officials told TOI that nearly 70 lakh second doses are due in the state of which 55 lakh doses are for covishield doses and 14-15 lakh beneficiaries are due for covaxin doses. With the state allocated nearly 2.02 crore doses for October, the officials said that while the immunisation had to be scaled upto 9-10 lakh it was a bit down due to the Navratra festivities, the torrential rain in the Marathwada region and the agricultural activities. The last 10 days the vaccination has been about 7-8 lakh and is expected to scale up in these two weeks, added the officials. Nearly 60 lakh doses have already been distributed to the district and more doses are expected soon. With the mission yuva swasthya launched the vaccination will be scaled up, they added. The state public health department had set a target of 8-9 lakh vaccinations daily in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/in-45-plus-category-only-44-completely-vaccinated/articleshow/87230595.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The list will be released by the colleges subject to availability of seats in various courses. For courses in which seats are still available, the last announced cutoff for the respective subjects will be considered as the qualifying marks. With the payment portal for the third cutoff list closing at 5 pm on Saturday, over 60,000 seats out of a total of 70,000 seats are already taken. Senior officials said that over 1.7 lakh aspirants had applied to the different colleges under the first three lists.

Candidates who are already admitted in any programme and college of DU will not be eligible to participate in the special cutoff,” the varsity said. Usually aspirants are permitted to shift colleges and courses as cutoffs drop in subsequent lists. However, this will not be permitted under the special cutoff list. Senior university officials further explained, “The special cutoff will be the last declared cutoff of the respective programme and college. For example, if the cutoff for BA (H) political science was 99% initially at a particular college and the college did not declare the second and third cutoffs for the course, but later seats got vacant, then the special cutoff for BA (H) political science in the college will be 99%.” Aspirants will be permitted to apply to a single programme and college.

---||Hyderabad||Parties milk ‘GDP’ issue to the hilt to reach out to voters||Hyderabad: The rising prices of gas, diesel and petrol (GDP) has become a major election issue, among others, in the Huzurabad constituency going to the polls on October 30. While the TRS is blaming the BJP government at the Centre for the hike in GDP and having a cascading effect on the prices of essential commodities skyrocketing and throwing the monthly budget of middle and poorer sections of society out of gear, the BJP is hitting back at the TRS alleging that the state is collecting a tax of Rs 40 on one litre of petrol. Not to be left behind, Congress is blaming both the BJP government at the Centre and the TRS government in Telangana for the price hike by levying state and central taxes on fuel, which is burdening the people of the state. Finance minister T Harish Rao, who is spearheading the TRS campaign, is telling the voters of Huzurabad to bow with folded hands before the LPG cylinder before going to cast their vote on October 30 and defeat the BJP so that the prices of GDP reduced. “Not only the prices of essential commodities have gone up but even the cost of ploughing the field and harvesting the crop has gone up due to increase in the fuel rates,” Harish Rao said. Countering his claim, BJP state president Bandi Sanjay told the voters that while the Modi government was giving diesel at Rs 60-odd per litre, the TRS government is adding nearly Rs 40 state tax to it taking the price to over Rs 100 per litre. “KCR can give a litre of petrol or diesel at less than Rs 70 by withdrawing the state tax. But, he won’t do,” Sanjay said. Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy said a litre of petrol can be given at less than Rs 50 per litre if KCR and Modi governments withdraw the central and state taxes on it. “Both BJP and TRS are playing a drama. They are friends at the national level and project themselves as rivals in Telangana. Teach them a lesson on October 30 by voting Congress to victory,” he urged the voters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/parties-milk-gdp-issue-to-the-hilt-to-reach-out-to-voters/articleshow/87229988.cms||Roushan Ali

At the end of his formal address on the occasion, Rijiju said the foundation stone of two buildings was laid during the term of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and termed its inauguration at the hands of Thackeray as an example of ‘teamwork’. During his speech, Thackeray touched upon Rijiju’s comments. “Yes, I came here today (Saturday) only to raise the flag as a mark of inauguration. However, it is my commitment that the inauguration of the new complex of Bombay high court at the principal bench will take place soon and it will be accomplished during my term only,” he said. Fadnavis, during his term, had laid the foundation stone of the annex building of Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court in July 2018. BJP and Shiv Sena had locked horns over taking credit for the Chipi airport in Sindhudurga district. Ahead of the formal inauguration of the airport on October 9, both camps had put up posters claiming credit. Earlier, during his speech, Rijiju stressed on the need to reduce the gap between the justice delivery system and the public. “We are the largest democracy in the world and genuine efforts can ensure justice for all despite many challenges,” he said. Thackeray pledged his efforts for speedy justice to all. “On this occasion, I commit to you all that my government stands firm behind the efforts of strengthening our judiciary,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/union-law-minister-takes-shot-at-thackeray-cm-retorts/articleshow/87229325.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sharing the government’s preliminary data, the former MLA from Amravati said over 55 lakh hectares of agricultural land in the state was damaged due to incessant rains. “Due to depletion of land, no crop is sustainable for the next ten years. However, the Thackeray government is mocking the farmers by providing a paltry aid of Rs 10,000 per hectare. To add to their woes, most of them did not receive a single penny. Farmers in the state are frustrated, as not even a fraction of the announced aid has reached them.” Dr Bonde added that thousands of farmers would be in darkness due to the government’s apathy, but “Matoshri, Varsha and Mantralaya will be lit up during the festival season”. “If the CM is concerned about the distressed farmers, he should not celebrate the festival and should not lit up both his homes. The government officials and brokers have conspired to defraud the farmers in the state. While the soybean crop was lost due to heavy rains, the farmers were misled by the lure of huge yields of this crop,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/farmers-to-observe-black-diwali-due-to-mva-govt-bonde/articleshow/87230612.cms||---

---||Delhi||Man harassed, why action not be initiated against Delhi cops, asks court||NEW DELHI: A court has pulled up some police officials for creating fear in the mind of a man about his false implication and arrest in a case and asked why proceedings should not be initiated against them for their conduct. Complainant Zakir approached the court alleging that a police official of Delhi’s Dayalpur police station harassed him and his father and threatened to arrest the entire family without disclosing the contents of an FIR, a claim refuted by the police. In a reply filed to his plea, the police submitted that no cognizable offence was found committed by Zakir and no FIR has been registered against him, adding that Zakir’s father was not harassed rather he was intimated about the complaint. Noting that police did not adopt the correct procedure, Additional sessions judge Sunil Chaudhary said that the act of the police officials deputed in the police station “created fear” in Zakir’s mind about his false implication and arrest and forced him to approach the court. “Thus, considering the facts, let show cause notice be issued to the officials of PS Dayalpur as to why proceedings be not initiated against them for payment of compensation to the applicant for their conduct,” the judge said in an order dated October 22. He went on to say that under the law if a complaint discloses a cognisable offence then police is duty-bound to register an FIR and investigate the allegations but according to police’s reply, the complaint did not disclose any cognisable offence. “...in those events, if station house officer was of the impression that the complaint needs investigation then he has to seek the permission to investigate the matter from the court concerned but he did not adopted the said procedure,” ASJ Chaudhary added. Notably, Zakir said that his father received a call from an official of the Dayalpur police station on October 14 and was threatened to come to the police station and when his father enquired about the FIR, he did not disclose the same. The complainant, through his lawyer, submitted that the police official harassed him and his father unnecessarily and that on October 15, some police officials visited his residence but did not disclose the purpose of the visit and threatened to arrest the entire family. However, the police stated that on October 14, a man named Naimuddin gave a complaint about quarrels and beatings against Zakir. “Father of the applicant has not been harassed and no threat has been given rather he was intimated about the complaint given against him,” the prosecutor told the court.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Redevelopment of Egmore railway station delayed||CHENNAI: Redevelopment of Egmore railway station is likely to be delayed as the railway ministry has decided to shut down Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) that was working on making it a world-class facility. Now, railways will have to start work on it afresh. Since it took almost seven years after the corporation was formed to include Egmore on the list of stations to be developed, shutting down of the corporation will delay it further. IRSDC had also signed an agreement with a public sector firm for the purpose in 2019 and would have floated a tender to take the work forward. The agency, which was set up in 2012, was also entrusted to develop Coimbatore railway station in the state. Southern Railway has formed a core group to identify stations and carry out redevelopment which includes improving the station, developing its land for commercial use and others. A senior railway official said that railways will now take over the work and will do the redevelopment of stations directly at all divisions. “The core group of officers has been set up at zonal level and at divisional level and will identify stations, conduct studies, call tenders etc. Redevelopment is a new concept different from adding facilities at stations,” he said. Southern Railway is already adding amenities and is improving platforms, buildings at Egmore railway station. IRSDC’s plan was to use the land available to convert railway stations into huge snazzy structures that look like airport terminals without hampering existing heritage qualities. This also includes developing multi-modal facilities, for which Egmore had good scope because it has suburban trains, express trains, metro rail and MTC connectivity. Egmore railway station is the second biggest station in the city handling more than three lakh passengers per day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/redevelopment-of-egmore-railway-station-delayed/articleshow/87230614.cms||---

The court said the “protectors are not supposed to become predators”. “In Bible, saying ‘if the salt has lost its flavour, wherewith shall it be salted?’ or as the ancient Romans would generally say ‘Who will guard the Praetorian guards?’,” the court said in the order. Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi said it was a serious matter where six police officials, as directed by their superiors, engaged in prima facie an illegal act, that is barging into the man’s house in the middle of the night, kept knocking on the door for about an hour to arrest him on the mere suspicion of his being involved in sheltering other accused people. “It is the admitted case that the raiding party did not recover anything from the applicant's house. The raiding party members were all police personnel and it was their duty to uphold the law. But far from performing their duties, they appear to have acted as criminals… The house of the applicant was raided on alleged specific information as mentioned in police report. However, ex facie there is nothing in support of the fact of alleged specific information with police that the applicant was sheltering the accused people,” the court observed. It further said that the contention of the prosecution that the man inflicted the injuries upon himself is not appealing to any reason. It added that as per their own version, the police party kept knocking the door for about 45 minutes and waited there, still it could not join any person from neighbouring houses as an independent witness to the alleged act. “Secondly, the photographs of the applicant with blood splattered all over show the injuries inflicted on him and the story of self-inflicted injuries does not appeal to any reason. The act of the police officials of raiding the applicant’s house, ransacking the same besides attacking and extending injuries to him and his family members sans any reason can be termed as the worst state of affairs possible in society,” it noted. The court granted anticipatory bail to Anwar Khan, whose house was raided and then he was arrested. It directed him to join the investigation. Additional Public Prosecutor Rakesh Kumar, appearing for the police, had opposed the anticipatory bail plea, saying the raiding party consisting of police officials had gone to the house of Khan based on specific information regarding the shelter allegedly given by him to dreaded criminals Shahrukh and Govind who are allegedly involved in murder cases. The public prosecutor further argued that Khan allegedly started shouting and using abusive language to police and suddenly took out a blade and attacked a few members of the raiding party and then inflicted injuries upon his own body. Advocate M M Khan, appearing for Khan, had submitted that the police officials illegally raided his house on the intervening night of April 7-8. He further claimed that the applicant and his family were victims at the hands of these police officials and to further terrorise them, the FIR was allegedly registered by errant police officials, levelling false and baseless allegations against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-raps-cops-for-illegal-raid-in-the-middle-of-night/articleshow/87231134.cms||Usha Das

Under the ‘Award for Excellence in Urban Transport’, the ministry has adjudged Surat as the best performing city for its use of technology in safety, security and traffic management. In the past other cities from different states have been awarded for their achievements under this category. This is the first time that Diamond City has been selected for this award. The award will be given to senior state police officers on October 29 at the valedictory session of Urban Mobility India conference in New Delhi. The award was announced by the MoHUA on Friday. “The ministry considers various aspects of each city and Surat was found using the technology in the best manner for safety, security and maintenance of record. We have been using modern technologies for managing traffic and surveillance,” city police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI. The city started using CCTV surveillance in 2012 with 104 cameras at 23 locations. At present, there are more than 700 CCTV cameras under the city police network. “We have cameras with facial and automatic number plate recognition.

---||Delhi||No cheers: Ahead of Diwali, flower market fails to bloom in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Diwali is just around the corner, and there’s some activity involving marigold flowers at the Ghazipur flower market. But sadly, much of it has to do with picking up sacks of rotting blooms and throwing them into a tempo to be carted away for disposal. The rains recently had damaged the unsold stocks. But that was only an additional problem. Sellers moaned that business has been poor, with stocks just not moving because the festive season has been low-key and Diwali too appears set to be a muted affair. On Friday morning, when TOI was at the flower market, buying and selling was at a minimum. Glum stall owners said this has been the situation since the Covid-19 pandemic and the attendant restriction doused all festive enthusiasm. Meena, who has been selling marigold there for four months, said “I just can’t get more than Rs 5 per kilo of marigold heads,” she said. “Even today, no sale has taken place and by tomorrow I will have to discard the flowers since marigold has a short shelf life.” Rizwan gets his supply of marigold from his home district of Sambhal in UP. “I paid Rs 3,200 for the flowers and Rs 5,000 for transportation and got seven men to pluck the heads. I am able to sell no more than 12 strands a day,” he grumbled. “I had acquired land for a lakh of rupees to grow marigold. I have to feed a family of nine but don’t even have money to return home.” Like Rizwan, Surendra Kumar too has more flowers on hand than is being demanded. At his shop in the flower market, Kumar sat with a frown on his face. “We are throwing the genda away because there aren’t too many transactions taking place,” he said. “The situation was slightly better during Navratri, but the price has gone down after that. The three days of rainfall also caused us much damage at a time when there were no sales happening. So, on top of paying the flower growers and transporters, we now have to pay to get rid of the rotting flowers. We are losing around Rs 1,000 on every sack of marigold.” Mukesh Yadav added, “We are throwing away quintals of genda every day. We can only hope the price rises to Rs 20-30 per kilo in the coming days. With puja now mostly only at home, buyers just want a kilo or two of the flowers. People are still not allowed at big temples, so big sales are out of the question. Besides, families that lost their dear ones in the second wave of Covid infections aren’t celebrating Diwali or decorating their house this year.” While many sellers felt sales might increase closer to Diwali on November 4, others pointed out that it wouldn’t make a difference to their bottom line because their losses were too big to offset. The coronavirus-hit business can only hope to cut losses even if prices go up. There is no scope for profits this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-cheers-flower-mkt-fails-to-bloom/articleshow/87231628.cms||---

The impact of the tremors were felt mainly in Mancherial at 2.04 pm. On experiencing the tremors, people ran out of their houses at College Road, Sunnambattiwada, Srirampur, Sitarampur and SCCL Nagarjuna Colony. There was, however, no damage on account of the mild quake.

The quake occurred in the Godavari rift area. According to locals in Mancherial town, the tremors were felt for just a couple of seconds. Since it falls in the Singareni coal mines area, locals initially assumed them to be blasts connected to mining. Seismologists said that the seismic activity in the place should not be seen as an unusual activity. It was described as a ‘tectonic earthquake’ and that it posed no risk.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mild-tremors-hit-mancherial/articleshow/87230014.cms||---

The tech-based equipment can douse fires in congested localities or in places where ladders cannot scale above a point, like high-rises. Also, the fire brigade will soon induct a ‘special purpose vehicle’ to put out fires.Such a vehicle is also used to fight fires in high-rises. One such vehicle is being manufactured currently and is expected to be inducted into the fire brigade in December. The mobile fire-fighting system can be used in a high-rise if the building’s internal fire-fighting system fails. Drones had been used to fight the fire that broke out at One Avighna Park, near Lalbaug, on Friday. “But the drone was used only for surveillance and to check for anyone left behind [in the building]. We are in talks with manufacturers for drones that can do actual fire-fighting,” said R S Choudhary, deputy chief engineer, (Technical), Mumbai Fire Brigade. He said they are exploring drones with high payload capacity so that they can take water pipes to higher floors to douse flames. “...We now use drones only for reconnaissance and surveillance operations, but we want to use drones for fire-fighting. For this, we need drones with high payload capacity, and we are likely to get them soon,” he added. Chaudhary said that the fire brigade will also commission a remote-controlled tower water van. It is a 55-mt-tall tower to tackle blazes in high-rises down narrow streets or in inaccessible slum areas. With its five inbuilt expandable arms, the water tower vehicle can stretch from atop any structure to spray water and douse flames even if fire vehicles are unable to reach the site. Its cost pegged at Rs 12 crore, the vehicle is expected to be added to the fire brigade’s arsenal in a few weeks. “This arms can be suspended in the air vertically up to 55mt and horizontally up to 50mt. So this will help us fight fires in dense slums and high-rises,” Chaudhary said. “Though the fire brigade currently has ladders, the tallest being 90mt, they have a fixed design and cannot enter congested areas.” The water van has a boom, which has a camera mounted on its tip, that can also enter a building through windows and directly spray water and douse the flames, said the officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fire-brigade-to-get-drones-that-can-lug-a-hose-high-up-to-fight-blaze-in-mumbai/articleshow/87231864.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Camera traps drowned, tiger count in Corbett Tiger Reserve to start again||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand will have to start the tiger estimation exercise in a 108 sq km area of Corbett Tiger Reserve again after torrential rains swept away 27 camera traps installed inside the reserve. “Data captured in the camera traps — covering 108 sq km — is lost now. The tiger estimation exercise in the area will have to be started from scratch,” R K Tiwari, warden of the reserve, told TOI. The reserve area spans 520 sq km. The camera traps were installed earlier this month to provide the tiger count of the area for a nationwide tiger estimation exercise which is carried out every four years. Camera traps are attached to the base of trees and are generally equipped with infrared sensors to sense movement and capture images of wildlife. In the case of tigers, images taken by camera traps can help identify each individual through its unique stripes. Corbett authorities said 494 camera traps had been installed in Ramnagar division of the reserve. Almost all zones of the reserve lost camera traps, but Dhela zone — which lost 10 of the devices — and Bijrani zone, where four camera traps were washed away, were the worst affected. A request has been forwarded for new cameras to kick off the tiger estimation exercise, authorities said. Tiwari said the lost camera traps are unlikely to pose a threat to wildlife or provide any information to poachers. “By now, the cameras would either be buried deep under debris or would be so damaged that no one can find any information on it,” he said. TOI had earlier reported that at least 250 km of forest land has been washed away in Kumaon division of rain-battered Uttarakhand, according to an estimate by the forest department. Several forest roads — which would measure 600-km combined — were also washed away after the heavy downpour. In Corbett, 120 km of forest roads have been eroded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/floods-drown-camera-traps-tiger-count-in-corbett-to-start-again/articleshow/87230034.cms||Shivani Azad

The party also demanded transfer of police officials. The party leaders also gave a call for statewide protests against the incident. Sanjay said the TRS was trying to foment terror as it fears losing the October 30 elections. “Even during the GHMC and Dubbak elections, the TRS had resorted to such attacks. We have already complained to the NHRC about Friday’s attack,” he said. He alleged that TRS cadre were acting at the behest of CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. “The police department has failed to provide protection to the Union minister,” he said. Aruna said TRS leaders were resorting to attacks out of frustration and fear of losing election. “The ruling party wants to postpone the election. People would teach the TRS a fitting lesson,” she said. In various public meetings on Saturday, Kishan Reddy said the by-elections were crucial as it would give direction to the state. He said Eatala was ousted from the TRS when he started questioning the government. “By removing Eatala from the party, KCR has insulted the people of Huzurabad,” Kishan Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-resorting-to-attacks-out-of-fear-of-losing-bypoll-bandi/articleshow/87230029.cms||---

MGVCL’s managing director Tushar Bhatt told media persons that all power distribution companies in the state have taken adequate measures to ensure uninterrupted power supply to consumers. He said that there is no scarcity of coal in the state and coal-based power plants have enough supply to remain functional. Bhatt also assured that consumers will not face any kind of power shortage during the forthcoming festive season and MGVCL is ensuring that even farmers do not face any problems of power supply. Stressing that all plants of Gujarat State Electricity Corporation (GSEC) Limited will start functioning in the next couple of days, Bhatt said that currently MGVCL’s requirement in its jurisdiction comes to 1,600 MW per day. “Five plants of GSEC are already functional and ten other will start generating power within the next couple of days. Additionally, we are purchasing surplus power available with other states. Power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind is being utilised during the day time while thermal and hydro energy is being utilised during night,” he said. He said that agriculture feeders in rural areas are facing scheduled cut of maximum 30 minutes. “We are taking enough measures to ensure that there is no shortage,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/no-power-shortage-in-state-mgvcl/articleshow/87229888.cms||---

Speaking to reporters in Nashik, Raut said, “The Centre has been using agencies like ED, IT, CBI and now the latest addition is the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to defame and destablise our government in one way or the other. We are confident that the use of these agencies will not serve any purpose as our government is working in cohesion.” According to him, the MVA was a strong replica of what NCP chief Sharad Pawar had done in 1978 with the formation of the PDF government. “Sharad Pawar had formed the PDF with political parties of different ideologies and it was based on a common minimum programme. After many years, Pawar was again instrumental in bringing together Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress on single platform. This government is very strong and it will not only remain in power for five years, but even in future,” Raut said. When his attention was drawn towards the fight between Shiv Sena ex-MLA Ravikiran Gholap and current NCP MLA Saroj Ahire over the laying of a foundation stone, Raut said such issues are bound to surf up and would be resolved.  Raut said Chhagan Bhujbal would have received a better portfolio today if he had been in Shiv Sena. When asked about an October 22 resolution by industries department using the name ‘Sambhajinagar’ as well as Aurangabad, Raut said, “We have done what we promised.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/govt-stable-will-complete-term-raut/articleshow/87229376.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Police said Mohit Trivedi, Dharmendra Singh and Rinku Rana have been held for their alleged involvement in the incident. Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra's son, Ashish Mishra, is one of the co-accused. All the three arrested on Saturday were allegedly in the third vehicle, which was part of the convoy of three SUVs, one of which mowed the five men, and had been on the run after the incident. The SIT will seek their police remand for questioning. So far, 13 people have been arrested in the case. Special prosecution officer S P Yadav told TOI: “All the accused were produced before the remand magistrate and they have been sent to judicial custody till November 2. We have also sought their police custody remand and our application will be heard by the chief judicial magistrate on October 25.” The SIT has recovered CCTV footage that shows the three vehicles in the convoy leaving towards the site where over 1,000 farmers were protesting. There are also supporting videos shot by farmers moments some of their fellow protesters were run over by the first SUV in the convoy. Farmers have provided these videos to the SIT and all of them, including the CCTV footage, have been sent for forensic tests. Ashish Mishra has been remanded in police custody till Sunday evening along with seven other co-accused, including Sumit Jaiswal and Ankit Das, a Lucknow-based contractor who owned the black Fortuner, which was the second vehicle in the convoy. The recent arrests were made after Shishupal, the driver of the white Scorpio who was arrested earlier, revealed names of other men in his vehicle during questioning by the police. A member of the SIT told TOI: “We are able to connect one string with another and the investigation is moving at a satisfactory pace. We will be able to file a chargesheet within the permissible time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/3-more-arrested-in-lakhimpur-case-13-so-far/articleshow/87230055.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nashik||Nashik: Groundwater agency wary of workers’ stir||NASHIK: The Groundwater Survey and Development Agency (GSDA) fears its work of testing for bacteriological impurities in the water sources in the rural areas could be affected by the agitation of the contractual employees. There are seven laboratories across Nashik district. While six of the laboratories are located in various talukas, one is at the district-level office of the GSDA. Out of the 95 employees in the rural areas, the contracts of 69 have not been renewed for the past three months. These contract employees have now decided to stop the work. The contractual employees of the water testing laboratories in the rural areas have warned of a statewide agitation from October 25. That is likely to affect water testing across all laboratories. “Water samples from the sources are collected by the jalsurakshak (employees of the Zilla Parishad in Nashik) from the rural areas and they are brought to the laboratories for testing. The testing is done by the chemists and bacteriologists, whose contracts have not been renewed,” said Jeevan Bedwal, a senior officer of the GSDA, Nashik. Every day, each laboratory tests more than 25 samples through various processes. Any adverse parameters are brought to the notice of local civic bodies, who then have to take corrective measures, Bedwal explained. Another senior officer added: “The samples would remain untested during the period of the agitation.” Kapil Gujar, the vice-president of the association of contractual employees, said, “The state government had taken steps to outsource the services though the contractual employees have been doing their work sincerely for the past four years. The organisation approached the high court, which said that ‘No coercive steps be taken against petitioner’. Despite that, the contract renewal process has been stopped for the past five months.” The association has warned of an indefinite hunger strike at Pune from October 26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/groundwater-agency-wary-of-workers-stir/articleshow/87229383.cms||---

Gandhi said there is a need to “rethink the agriculture policy”. He tweeted: “Samodh Singh, a farmer of UP, had been running around mandis (marts) for the last 15 days to sell his paddy crop. When paddy did not sell, he, in frustration, set it on fire. Where has this system brought the farmers?" Varun Gandhi's tweet soon went viral on social media, and it was retweeted nearly 7,000 times by Saturday evening. He told TOI: “There is no greater punishment that a farmer can inflict upon himself than setting fire to his own crop. We must all introspect as to why the system has pushed them to the edge for no fault of their own. It is a failure of the entire nation if we cannot protect those who feed us.” On October 14, Varun Gandhi had shared an old video of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1980, where he said: “I would like to warn the government that it should leave the ways of repression and stop scaring farmers as they can’t be scared. We don’t want to use the farmer’s movement for politics, but if the government would misuse laws against the farmers, we shall not hesitate to jump in their support.” On October 10, the BJP MP, through a tweet, had said that an attempt was being made to turn the Lakhimpur Kheri incident into a “Hindu versus Sikh” battle and warned against “creating these fault lines and reopening wounds that have taken a generation to heal”. He has been tweeting in favour of the farmers and has written multiple letters to UP CM Yogi Adityanath, outlining several measures that could help farmers improve revenues and resolve issues, including increasing sugarcane prices, and doubling the amount disbursed under the PM Kisan scheme and the bonus on wheat and paddy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/failure-of-nation-if-we-cannot-protect-those-who-feed-us-varun-gandhi/articleshow/87230049.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rain may bring air back into ‘satisfactory’ zone||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘moderate’ category with an AQI of 173 on Saturday. Track the pollution level in your cityThe Central Pollution Control Board said the air was expected to improve to ‘satisfactory’ in the next two days as rain and gusty winds are likely to clean the air. As the wind direction changed to south-easterly, the result of stubble burning fouling the air was negligible on Saturday. India Meteorological Department has predicted light to moderate showers on Sunday with the rain to be accompanied by winds at speeds of 30-40 kmph. The rain and wind are likely to disperse pollutants. “The air quality is predicted to improve on Sunday and Monday and the contribution of farm fires in Delhi’s PM2.5 is likely to remain negligible for two days,” said a met official. The pollution level is likely to start rising from October 25 as the wind direction changes to north-westerly. Other meteorological factors may also hamper the dispersion of pollutants. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the Union earth sciences ministry’s forecasting body, said that the farm fire count in the neighbourhood of Delhi as per its methodology was 1,526 and their proportion in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollutants was 3%. With the impact of stubble burning negligible, the overall AQI will remain in the ‘moderate’ category for the next three days, it forecast. L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said that 1,209 farm fires were observed in Punjab and Haryana combined on October 21. “During the peak burning period in late October and early November, unfavourable meteorological conditions like falling temperatures and northwesterly winds will favour the transport of smoke downwind, thereby compounding the impact of stubble burning on Delhi's air quality,” he cautioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rain-may-bring-air-back-into-satisfactory-zone/articleshow/87231145.cms||---

As per the MSEDCL, over one lakh consumers’ electricity supply in Western Maharashtra was cut in the month of September for failing to pay the dues. Velankar said consumers are often unaware of the 15-days’ prior notice before power is cut, so MSEDCL should adhere to it. An MSEDCL official said they do serve notices on registered mobile numbers of the consumer via SMS. However, the official was unaware if a physical copy of the notice is served or not. “Since these days almost everything is done via the registered mobile number, prior intimation about a reading, bill, and units is given from time-to-time via SMS to the consumer. So is the notice that if they fail to pay the pending electricity bill amount within the stipulated deadline, they will face action.” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/consumers-ask-for-warning-before-strict-msedcl-cuts-lines-over-dues/articleshow/87230649.cms||---

The estimated population of Madhya Pradesh is around 8.35 crore. It was estimated that around 5.5 crore of them are those aged 18 years or above. Thus, close to three crore are children below 18 years of age. Of these, around two crore are estimated to be kids aged above 2 years. Schools have already opened in the state and if vaccination of kids is to be done even in a phased out manner, it would be a herculean task to identify those children with comorbidities, said sources. Official say that the training of the master trainers has been completed for vaccination. “We are awaiting instructions for implementation. Training of the master trainers have been done,” mission director, NHM, Madhya Pradesh, Priyanka Das told TOI. Sources from the health department said that there would be some changes in the syringe size for example and training to the field staff has to be provided for the purpose. Otherwise, the entire cold storage chain is ready, training of master trainers is done, and the officials have manpower in force said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/jabs-for-kids-infra-in-place-mp-awaits-nod-to-begin-drive/articleshow/87230644.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Dehradun||NTCA panel confirms illegal construction at Corbett, recommends vigilance enquiry||Dehradun: Confirming illegal road and building construction in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), an inspection team from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), which recently visited the reserve in the period between September 26 and 30, to probe allegations of illegality, said it found the claims to be true. The committee report, signed on October 22, addressed to ADG forests (Project Tiger) and member secretary, NTCA, confirms violation of some of the most stringent forest and wildlife laws of the country. The report, a copy of which is with TOI , says that the height of the contentious Kandi road through Corbett, whose actual width is 3m, has been “increased by 5ft for up to 1.2km with width varying from 11-15m, without any approval.” Also, the report says, “four units of independent buildings are under construction at Morghatti and Pakhro forest rest house campus, with excavation of a large quantity of soil being observed in Pakhro forest rest house campus.”  “The ongoing construction in one of the highest density habitats of the world without any sanctions and in violation of various statutory provisions/court orders is an 'excellent example of both administrative and managerial failure'. Appropriate actions are required against all the forest officers responsible for such grave violations,” the panel members pointed out. Elaborating the violations, the report reads, “The committee reviewed all statutory documents available with the office of field director, CTR, and DFO, Kalagarh and found that no statutory prior approval/sanctions have been obtained for the construction activities on Kandi road, Morghatti forest rest house, Pakhro forest rest house and waterbody near Pakhro … The work has been executed by violating provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Indian Forest Act, 1927.” Going further, the committee also recommended a ‘vigilance enquiry’ for the violations. “The state government must constitute a vigilance enquiry against the officers involved in the construction activity without any requisite approval,” the committee said, adding that “all illegal constructions in Morghatti and Pakhro forest rest house campus should be demolished and eco-restoration work be undertaken with immediate effect and cost involved for the same should be recovered from the officials concerned.” Interestingly, with regard to felling of thousands of trees for the Pakhro Tiger Safari as envisioned by PM Modi during his visit to CTR in February 2019, the committee directed “revisiting the project looking at the present density of forest patch…and avoid the project to become a mere wasteful expenditure of public money.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ntca-panel-confirms-illegal-construction-at-corbett-recommends-vigilance-enquiry/articleshow/87230062.cms||Shivani Azad

The Kheri district administration has requested officials of neighbouring Sitapur and Bahraich districts to share information about any bodies that they recover in the Ghaghra river. Seventeen people were on the boat and were trying to reach a safer place when it capsized because of “high waves”, according to Amresh Kumar, sub divisional magistrate, Palia. Nine of them were rescued on the same day. Dhaurahra’s sub divisional magistrate, Renu Singh, told TOI: “There is high probability that we have lost them, but no bodies have been recovered yet. We have alerted neighbouring districts and have asked them to share information about the bodies that are fished out of the river. Looking at the flow of water, it is highly likely that they may have been swept away to other districts. According to procedure, we have to wait for one month before declaring them dead.” Floods in Sharda, Ghaghra and other rivers have wreaked havoc in the Kheri district, claiming the lives of seven people. Ten people, including eight involved in the boat capsizing incident, are feared dead. At present, over 210 villages are affected by floods in the Lakhimpur Kheri district. Many link roads and metre gauge rail lines have been washed away by flood waters in the district. The metre-gauge rail service has been suspended for an indefinite period. Over 4,000 families have been forced to leave their homes and take shelter at higher places or at flood outposts. Dhaurahra tehsil was the worst-affected tehsil, as both the Ghaghra and Sharda rivers cross through the area. One hundred and nine villages have been affected in the tehsil. Palia’s sub divisional magistrate, Amresh Kumar, told TOI: “It was one of the worst floods that completely washed away many villages in no time, without giving much warning to the locals. Fortunately, rescue work was carried out in time and people were sent to higher places. Two people died, while two are missing and we are yet to find their bodies. A total of 48 villages were affected in the Palia tehsil and over 1,000 families have been relocated. The situation is coming under control, but road connectivity to Palia town and Nepal via the Gauriphanta border is still not reinstated because water is flowing above the highway road.” The family of the victims who passed away will be eligible for a compensation of Rs 4 lakh under the state disaster relief fund, added Kumar. Nighasan’s sub divisional magistrate, Om Prakash Gupta, told TOI: “Four people have died due to the flood in Nighasan and we have taken up relief and rehabilitation measures on a war footing to minimise problems faced by the people. At present, 40 villages are affected in Nighasan tehsil.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/boat-capsize-in-ups-kheri-8-feared-dead-neighbouring-districts-on-alert/articleshow/87230059.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nashik||Power snapped, streets in 500 Nashik villages dark||NASHIK: The streets in over 500 villages of Nashik district are dark these days after sunset. The state power utility has snapped the connections as the village panchayats concerned have failed to pay the bills. Pradeep Pagar, a farmer from a village in Kalwan, said the scene after sunset was scary. “It looks terrible and is fearsome. We are so accustomed to the lights that the darkness in the streets is scary,” he said. The scene is the same in other villages in Nashik, Kalwan and Satana talukas as well. The Nashik zone of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) is on a disconnection drive to recover the dues from its consumers. The people of villagers, that are prone to nocturnal visits of wild animals such as leopards and hyenas, said the situation was grim. “Leopards can attack any time. The dark streets a create perfect condition for the wild animals to attack if anybody ventures out after 7 pm. Will the government take action only after a life is lost?” questioned Rakesh Paitl, resident of Niphad taluka, just on the outskirts of Nashik city. The MSEDCL officials, however, claimed that the gram panchayats in Nashik and Malegaon circles owed huge outstanding to the company. In all, 358 villages in Malegaon circle owed Rs 87.87 crore and over 1,000 villages in Nashik circle owed Rs 150.62 crore. The total outstanding was Rs238.49 crore. “There is a large outstanding with the gram panchayats. We have been urging them to at least settle the current dues. As the gram panchayats have failed to do so, the company has embarked on the disconnection drive. Power supply to street lights in more than 500 villages has been snapped,” said Vikas Adhe, the public relations officer of the MSEDCL, Nashik zone. The officer said the company had sent reminders to the gram panchayats but that had not helped. The All India Sarpanch Parishad has objected to the stand taken by the MSEDCL and the state government. “The state government has told the gram panchayats to settle dues with its own funds. A gram panchayat – depending upon its size – hardly earns any revenue unless it has some industries in the vicinity. It can hardly carry out regular activities and pay salaries to its employees. Besides, during Covid time, the house tax and water cess are pending. They are in no position to settle the dues,” said Anil Dhikle, the executive president of the Parishad. They have also presented a memorandum to district collector requesting the state government to immediately settle the dues in the interest of the citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/power-snapped-streets-in-500-nashik-villages-dark/articleshow/87229387.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The court will hear the matter on November 12. The conservator of forests, Abhishek Tiwari, who appeared through video conference and submitted a report, stated that the eco-sensitive zone could go up to 10km and this stone crusher is installed within 6.4km radius. In the last hearing, the court had asked the conservator of forests to specify the distance between Rajaji National Park and the stone crusher within 24 hours. The petitioner, Devendra Singh Adhikari, a resident of Kotdwar, has filed the PIL, saying Shiddhabali stone crusher has been installed in the Reserve Forest of Rajaji National in Kotdwar. Adhikari had told the court that the stone crusher does not meet the norms laid down by the Supreme Court, according to which no stone crusher can be installed within 10km radius of the national park, while this one is just over 6km away from the park. Earlier, the government submitted its report, saying the stone crusher is 13km away, following which, the petitioner urged the court to conduct an aerial survey to measure the exact distance. The stone crusher does not even meet the PCB guidelines, the petitioner said. It also poses a threat to animals and therefore, its operations should be banned, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/make-goi-wildlife-board-parties-to-stone-crusher-removal-case-ukhand-hc/articleshow/87230076.cms||---

On interrogation, Goliya told police he had planned the murder beforehand. According to him, on October 3, Rahul, the deceased, had bashed and abused him in front of his friends. Since then he planned to settle scores. On Friday night, when he saw Rahul and his cousin Sagar sitting near the old post office in Prem Nagar, he summoned Rahul and when he came closer, he took out a .32 calibre country-made pistol and shot him thrice in the chest. Rahul was rushed to Doon Hospital but succumbed Saturday. Police have seized the murder weapon. In another firing on Mussoorie Road landed one person in hospital and led to another being booked for attempt to murder. Indian Reserve Battalion constable Nitin Kumar Lohan, 29, was booked for firing at Puneet Kharola, a shopkeeper, following an altercation. Lohan claimed Kharola tried to snatch his licensed gun, which accidentally fired and hit him in the stomach.

The body was spotted by a railway worker on duty in Lala Nagla village under Kemri police station on Friday. A police team that reached the spot found a bag near the body which contained identity cards that helped cops contact the man’s family. The family was informed about the man’s death and an autopsy was conducted which showed that he had died of injuries. Police said the nature of injuries suggested the man was hit by a train. Station house officer (Kemri police station), Gaurav Singh, told TOI the deceased’s brother, Pooran Ram, who does odd jobs for a living, confirmed the body belonged to Santosh Ram (21), a resident of Odura Pakhu in Pithoragarh. Santosh, a school dropout, had left home four days ago. “The man’s brother and mother told us they were stuck due to heavy rains in Uttarakhand and would not be able to travel since roads were blocked as well. They requested us to cremate the body following which we asked them for written permission,” said Singh. Once a written application was submitted to police online, additional superintendent of police (Rampur), Sansar Singh, issued directions for the body to be cremated with Hindu rituals. Cops performed the last rites and livestreamed it for the family so they could bid a virtual adieu to their loved one.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/family-stuck-in-ukhand-rains-up-cops-perform-mans-last-rites-livestream-it/articleshow/87230065.cms||Maria Khan

Malik has been criticising Wankhede, who had supervised a raid on a cruise ship which led to the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan. Malik has dubbed the officer as “bogus” and said once “proof” against him is out, he cannot remain in government service for even one day. The BJP hit back at Malik’s comments. “His statement against an officer from the central agency will have consequences.

I have set a Diwali deadline for the process and most of the work has already been done,” said Nashik mayor Satish Kulkarni. The counting of the number of potholes is an ongoing process, and so far, the PWD has filled more than 19,000 potholes. The survey carried out shows that less than 30% of the work is pending. NMC’s public works department (PWD) has been carrying out the maintenance and repair work since the showers took a break. “Earlier, temporary works were carried out as rain and damp conditions do not favour the use of tar for pothole-filling exercise. Besides, most of the work done with tar was also flooded by the subsequent spells of rain,” the officer added. He pointed out that mayor Satish Kulkarni and NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav had set a deadline for Diwali. There is a visible difference on the ITI-Ambad link road where the pothole-riddled stretch is now transformed into a motorable road — though it may not be very smooth. “I cycle to school on this road every day. Now, almost all the potholes have been replaced with repaired patches. Even if the road is not smooth, it is still safer for students like me who use bicycles,” said Sayalee Kshatriya, a resident of Kamatwade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-19000-potholes-fixed/articleshow/87229400.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Pune’s Amruttulya-inspired tea chains fuel chai and charcha in city||To have tea, buy a coupon. Requests for one-by-twos will not be entertained. Place the cup in the tray after drinking. Park car at your own risk. Do not gargle in the cooler's sink. Take care not to spill tea on another. No smoking zone. What reads like an Irani cafe notice board is really a Marathi poster at a Thane outlet of a popular tea chain from Pune whose Gandhi-topi-and-Kolhapuri-chappal-sporting mascot has grinned ceaselessly at rickshawallahs, delivery boys, construction workers, joggers, senior citizens, bikers, office goers, MLAs, cops, car owners and lovebirds as they slurped ten-rupee tea from saucer-less cups. In the last two years, this mute kettle-toting, moustachioed "Marathi manoos" from the neighbouring city has spawned several clones--and even some lungi-toting counterparts hailing from Udupi--across crannies and junctions in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai, signalling an omnipresence that must surely threaten the neighbourhood chaiwallah. Modern versions of Pune's almost-century-old Amruttulyas--crammed tea shops where cloth-filtered chais fuel unfiltered charchas--are slowly but surely invading Mumbai's gullet, one branded tea cup at a time. With a steely aura pitched somewhere between a roadside chai stall and artisanal tea lounges, these hygiene-promising minimalistic tea cafes invoke the wholesome appeal of Amruttulyas which trace their roots to 1880s Rajasthan when drought had made one Vishwanath Ojha and his wife trek 900 kms to Pune. There, the couple changed its surname to Nartekar, bought a small shop, sold bhaang until the sale of cannabis was outlawed and soon started selling sweets and chai, giving rise to the first ‘Amruttulya’ in 1924, suggests an article by a Pune cultural-mapping project. The popularity of such shops grew rapidly with Maharashtrians starting their own versions in the 1950s. "Amrut-tulya means tea equivalent to nectar," says Thane-based chemical engineer and digital marketer Ganesh Darekar, who launched the equal-parts-buffalo-and-cow-milk-favouring Malhar Amruttulya in 2019 to give fellow members who hail from Pune's Purandar taluka an "affordable franchisee model" at Rs 7 to 8 lakh. "It's a calculative business. A lot depends on volume," says Darekar, whose Majiwada outlet caters to everyone from the lockdown-hit rickshawallah having grateful "22-rupee-lunches" comprising twelve-rupee vada pav and ten-rupee teas to the chai addict who likes to prebook his customary 20 cups for the day with by paying a lump sum of Rs 200 every morning. Perhaps the first tea chain to cross the Expressway was Yewale Amruttulya, a four-year-old brand that began with the end of a rustic owner of two buffaloes who owned a tea shop in 1983. His demise had caused his sons to come up with a tea recipe in 2017 whose popularity has inspired many other brands in its wake. Most of them sprang up in the city just before the lockdown and are making up for time lost to the lockdown by rechasing their 1000-cups-a-day targets and close to Rs 50000-a-month profits. "Every brand has its own peculiar recipe, depending on the owner's quirk," says Sanket Chougule of Ratna Amruttulya, which shuns the exorbitantly-priced cardamom and relies on milk with a high (7.5 per cent) fat percentage and a brass vessel for flavour. "The tea is made in a brass vessel in a 'bhatti' which traps the vapours and adds to the colour," says Chougule, whose tea chain--with outlets in Thane, Goregaon and Charni Road apart from Nashik, Malegaon and Jalgaon--also boasts hot chocolate on the menu. "This is especially for young kids as they are not supposed to have tea," says Chougule. Green tea, lemon tea, jaggery tea, sugarless tea, cream rolls, cookies and vada pavs are among the other recent additions to the menu driven by demand. Equivalent to the Amruttulyas on affordability and aura, if not in scale, are kajli-stocking Kathiyawadi chai chains and sugary-milk-boasting Rajasthan's Nagori chai cafes that are still recovering from the pandemic. "Pre-pandemic, I would sell tea worth Rs 2000 a day. Now it has reduced to Rs 800 daily," says Ghulam Muhammad of Nagori Super Chai, a tiny Mira Road tea shop. Over at Madanpura, Sohail Mohammed Shafi--who owns Khwaja Milk Centre which also sells tea apart from lassi, faluda and curd at the narrow Lohe Ki Chawl--proclaims that his tea provides fuel not only to "karkhana" workers but also writers who come looking for stories, anecdotes and an elusive "naya sawera" at Zubair Azmi's literary society office nearby. Travel further south to Fort, and you'll chance upon a curiosity that's perhaps the only South Indian answer to the Amruttulyas. Helmed by brothers Anil and Sunil Shetty, Shetty Brothers Tea was born after their former enterprise offering 30 varieties of beverages fizzled out. In 2019, curiosity about the rise of Amruttulya cafes in the neighbourhood saw Anil tasting the sugary tea for clues. "It tasted like normal tea," says Anil Shetty, referring to the insight that made him launch the Udipi tea cafe where a white lungi-clad Shetty mascot creates an unfulfilled expectation. "Many ask for filter coffee," says Anil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-punes-amruttulya-inspired-tea-chains-fuel-chai-and-charcha-in-city/articleshow/87231890.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

The century-old Institution of Engineers here has erected an ‘elephant gate’ at the entrance of its local chapter. Chapter president D C Gour said the gate is a modern-day engineering marvel paying homage to the ancient structures. “We decided to demolish our existing gate and structure and create a new, more iconic one in 2017. The project was given to the students, who worked under the guidance of experts. Efforts and hard work of months has resulted in a creative and logical design for the gate,” he said. Made using thermomechanical bars, cement and concrete, along with other materials, the gate has come up at an expenditure of Rs 18 lakh. On naming the gate ‘elephant’, Gour said it symbolizes the life of an engineer as a mighty professional. “The form of the gate is inspired by the entrances to the Ajanta caves and Kailash temple at Ellora. The concept of sciography, which makes the best use of shadows, has also been aptly incorporated into the design of the gate,” he said. A team of architects, engineers and designers comprising Pranav Shankar, Dilip Sarda, Kamal Rao, Priya Benderkar, Pranav Bansode, Sanket Udhan and Tushar Phopse, along with other experts, were involved in making the gate. It was recently inaugurated by Minister of State for finance Bhagwat Karad. Established in 1920, The Institution of Engineers is one of the largest body of multi-disciplinary engineers across the country with an active presence in Aurangabad through its local chapter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aurangabad-gets-new-iconic-gate/articleshow/87229425.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Fresh rainfall and snow alert sparks fear as landslides shake Nainital||DEHRADUN/NAINITAL: An alert of rainfall and snow in Uttarakhand over the next 24 hours issued on Saturday has sparked fresh concerns in the state which is still grappling with the damage caused by rain-triggered disasters this week. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a forecast of light rainfall and snowfall in the higher reaches of Uttarakhand in the next 24 hours. “Very light to light rain and thundershowers are likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Haridwar, Chamoli, Nainital and Champawat districts on Sunday,” the IMD said, adding that snowfall is likely to occur at isolated places in higher reaches of Uttarkashi and Chamoli. The local Met department attempted to allay fears and said light rainfall is unlikely to cause damage. “There is a prediction of light rain, but no heavy showers are expected,” said an official. A fresh spell of snow in higher reaches, however, is likely to impede rescue operations which had to be halted on Saturday as well. While a search operation in Uttarkashi to trace two missing trekkers on Harsil-Chitkul trek was called off due to bad weather, another operation to airlift bodies of six trekkers who died en route Sunderdhunga glacier in Bageshwar district was also postponed. A search on foot, however, continued. The current death toll from rain-related incidents in the state stood at 72 on Saturday. Nainital, the worst-hit district, has continued to bear the brunt of landslides. On Saturday, a landslide was reported in Baliyanala area on a slope that has recorded recurrent landslides in the recent past. The administration has evacuated 70 families from the area and shifted them to a school. “The remaining 50 families will also be shifted to nearby schools and a dharamshala,” said a district official. Ward member from Baliyanala, Rekha Arya, said evacuated families have been put up in a school where 30 people have to share a single room and a toilet. “The area has faced recurrent landslides since October 17, but we received no help from the administration until now,” she said. Mukhtar Ali, a resident and president of Baliyanala Sangharsh Committee, told TOI the area was a vulnerable zone. “Every year, we face the same problem and the administration promises to come up with a long-term solution. We need a permanent solution,” Ali said. Earlier, a retaining wall had been built in the area to protect it from landslides, but landslides took down the wall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/fresh-rain-alert-sparks-fear-in-ukhand-as-landslides-shake-nainital/articleshow/87230096.cms||Gaurav Talwar

It will mark a progression from the previous roster and the subsequent biometric system by eliminating loopholes that allowed attendance to be manipulated, the CM said. Already in use in the Panchkula Municipal Corporation and Chandigarh administration, the GPS-enabled monitoring system has triggered protests from workers who have claimed that it breached their privacy. Addressing a rally in Sohna on Saturday, the CM said the new system will bring about “transparency and accountability in operations, and weed out fake, duplicate and false attendance”. Referring to the manual system of marking attendance in a register before 2014, the year he assumed office after BJP won the state election, Khattar said, “An employee would come to office after a week and put tick marks for all the days in the week in the attendance register. We introduced a biometric system after the formation of our government to bring discipline and regularise attendance of government employees.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/haryana-plans-smartwatches-for-employees-attendance/articleshow/87231186.cms||Bagish Jha

The stole depicts the insignia of a Shiva temple crafted in golden colour on a piece of silk-cotton blend. The water of the Ganga is also depicted adjacent to the temple. On the top of the temple, Kashi is embroidered in bold golden thread. “It took a week’s time to complete the stole,” said Mumtaz, who had also crafted a stole with rudraksh for the PM when he had visited the city earlier for the inauguration of Rudraksh international convention centre. “We love to make such artifacts for the PM,” he said. Both the artisans are residents of Lallapura locality. Banaras zardozi recently joined the elite club of Geographical Indication (GI). The stole was prepared under the direction of the GI expert Dr. Rajni Kant of Human Welfare Association. “The stole has already been handed over to the district administration for presenting to the PM on his arrival,” said Kant. According to Kant, zardozi is a heavy and more elaborate embroidery work which uses varieties of gold threads, spangles, beads, seed pearls, wire and gota. It is used to embellish wedding outfits, heavy coats, cushions, curtains, canopies, animal trappings, bags, purses, belts, and shoes. The material on which this kind of embroidery is done is usually heavy silk, velvet and satin. Zardozi embroidery thrived during the Mughal era and was believed to have been introduced to India from Persia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/pm-to-be-gifted-zardozi-angvastram/articleshow/87230675.cms||---
---||Dehradun||298 deaths in 2021, yr records highest disaster-related fatalities since ’13 deluge||Dehradun: With 298 deaths and 66 reported missing in weather-related disasters in 2021, the year has turned out to be the second-worst in terms of loss of lives in such calamities after 2013 when Kedarnath flash floods had taken thousands of lives. According to data with the State Operation Emergency Center (SEOC), nearly 300 people have died, 66 have been reported missing and over 100 people sustained injuries in weather-related calamities this year. This includes casualties in events like flash floods or floods, cloudbursts, avalanches, landslides and mudflows. Barring the 2013 deluge, this is the second-highest fatalities count in a year since 2010. While the hill state has had a long history of natural disasters, it was only in 2010 that the data collection system was enhanced. “While data related to natural disasters was being maintained earlier as well, flash floods in the monsoon season in 2010 prompted the state government to bolster its disaster management system and strengthen data collection,” said an official. A total of 220 people had died in natural disasters in 2010. Across the world, extreme weather events are on the rise, with experts pinning the blame on climate change. According to the sixth assessment report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), India will see heavier rainfall in the coming decades. Last week, rainfall broke century-old records in Uttarakhand, pushing up the tally of deaths in natural disasters this year. Heavy downpour in three days has resulted in 72 deaths in rain-related incidents until Saturday. The number is likely to rise since rescue operations are still on in the worst-hit Kumaon region. The year itself had begun on a grim note with floods in Dhauliganga in Chamoli district that struck on February 7 claiming 204 lives, according to official figures. In the months that followed, 22 more died in various rain-related incidents. Piyoosh Rautela, executive director at State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), said, “Uttarakhand is one of the most disaster-prone states in India due to its topography and geology and faces increased risk of calamitous events like flash floods, floods, cloudbursts, landslides etc.” In 2020, 82 people had perished in incidents of weather-related disasters. In the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, 225 people had lost their lives, according to official figures, while 4,021 went “missing” and were presumed dead. On average, 128 people have been killed every year in Uttarakhand due to natural disasters, according to data from the SEOC. Since 2010, nearly 1,600 people have been killed, 4,123 reported missing and over 1,000 injured in natural disasters, according to the disaster management department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/298-deaths-in-2021-yr-records-highest-disaster-related-fatalities-since-13-deluge/articleshow/87230101.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The gang used to reach out to police stations for bail of prisoners, by acting as their family members, usually uncle or aunt, police said, adding that the kingpin, identified as Rajesh Sharma and three others, charged Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 for pretending to be the accused’s uncle and aunt respectively. Divulging details, Moradabad SP Amit Kumar Anand said, “The gang was operating in Moradabad for the past six years. The members of the gang—kingpin Rajesh Sharma of Gopalpur village, Chajlet, Saeed alias Abdul Waheed of Kahiram Nagar, Majhola, Laeeq of Mundha Pandey and Raushan Jahan—used to visit the local police stations with fake documents and get prisoners out on bail, by pretending to be their relatives.” Civil Lines CO Indu Sidhartha said that during interrogation, the gang members revealed that they used to tell the police that family members of the prisoners couldn’t come as they were unwell. The kingpin, Sharma worked under an advocate at the district collectorate. He identified people in jail who had no one to get them bail, contacted them and fixed the deal. He also got fake Aadhaar cards and other necessary documents made. SP Anand added, “Three fake police station stamps and three fake Aadhaar cards have been seized from the gang. The accused persons have been booked under various IPC sections, including 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy).

---||Hyderabad||ACP grilled on varying crowd numbers, age of 4 accused||Hyderabad: Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) V Surender on Saturday faced a volley of questions on the varying figures of the crowd near Shadnagar police station (PS) on November 30, 2019, the day the four accused in the Disha gang-rape and murder case were nabbed, from the SC-appointed inquiry commission probing the alleged encounter killing of the quartet. The ACP was also grilled about the age of the four accused. So far, he has answered 298 questions. Appearing for the third consecutive day, the ACP, while answering a question posed by the commission’s advocate, mentioned that he had issued notices under Section 50-A of the CrPC to the family of the four accused at the time of their arrest and the family members produced Aadhaar cards as proof of identity (ID). The commission’s advocate then drew the attention of the ACP to a letter written by the latter to the superintendent of Cherlapally central jail on November 30, 2019, where it was mentioned that the ID proofs of the accused were “presently not available with him”. The ACP responded saying that thousands of people “attacked the police station on November 30, 2019” and he could not trace the documents given to him the previous night and during that time it was important for him to send the accused to the central prison after producing them before court. “Presently, the Aadhaar cards are available at Shadnagar ACP office and I can produce them, if required.” In response to a subsequent question, the ACP stated that by the time the accused were dispatched to the prison, about 50,000 crowd was there at the Shadnagar PS and then the commission’s advocate pointed out to him that in the statement before NHRC, he had mentioned that the strength of the crowd was only 5,000. The ACP then stated that a zero was missing in the statement recorded by NHRC team. Then, the ACP’s attention was drawn to a petition filed by him before the jurisdictional magistrate on December 2, 2019, while seeking police custody of the accused, where the strength of the crowd was mentioned as 3,000. “It was a typographical mistake. A zero is missing. Instead of writing 30,000, it was written 3,000,” the ACP stated. His deposition would continue on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/acp-grilled-on-varying-crowd-numbers-age-of-4-accused/articleshow/87230681.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Mumbai||Andheri society scores 100% on vaccination, Covid response||MUMBAI: Stories of housing societies that triumphed over the Covid challenge often have the common element of unity. Gundecha Symphony at Veera Desai Road, Andheri West, is a living testimony to this. On October 15, this society of 195 flats was awarded a certificate of merit by the BMC for achieving 100% vaccination of its residents. Anjana Kummar, an active volunteer of the society said, “Right after the lockdown was implemented, our society formed a ‘Covid task force’. We aligned with suppliers of daily essentials so that residents would not need to step out.” At a time when infected families were being stigmatised in their colonies, this society thoughtfully delivered cooked meals to Covid-affected households. The society’s senior citizens received special care and attention. Not only were their daily requirements met at the doorstep, but even vaccination was provided in the comfort of their homes. As for the 25 support staff, including watchmen and maids, they were housed in the parking area and club house, and cooked meals were prepared for them by the 195 families of the society in rotation. Kummar said, “Their boarding and lodging was managed completely by the residents. This was to keep their families safe. If any of them fell sick, they were quarantined here or in BMC centres, and their health updates were shared with their families.” The society ensured hospitalisation and oxygen for all who required it in coordination with BMC. The multi-pronged approach even addressed issues of boredom that confined residents were facing. Online tambola was organised, and “corridor parties” were held where people shared conversations over food and drink seated in the society corridor, with chairs placed a few feet apart. More recently, Gundecha Symphony has made vaccination its new mission. Camps have been held in association with BSES Hospital, Andheri, not just for residents, but also service personnel and nearby shopkeepers. One camp, in fact, covered 1,800 people. The society sponsored the shots for its workers. The fruits of its labour were realised on October 15, when it received a certificate for achieving 100% vaccination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-andheri-socy-scores-100-on-vaccination-covid-response/articleshow/87231892.cms||---

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Maharaja’s College synthetic track work moving at snail’s pace||KOCHI: Even after a month since the government allotted Rs 7 crore for the renovation of Maharaja’s College synthetic track, the project is progressing at a snail’s pace. A meeting convened by mayor M Anil Kumar on September 17 had decided to review the progress of the preparatory works within two weeks, but the college authorities haven’t convened the meeting so far. According to sources in the college, a controversy related to felling of trees in the college campus and its sales is the major reason for the slow progress of the preparatory works. “At the meeting held on September 17, it had been decided to conduct a review meeting within two weeks. By that time, the college authorities and those associated with Kerala Sports Council were asked to complete the preliminary works of the project. Inspection of the synthetic track by experts was advised to be completed within a few days,” said CICC Jayachandran, a member of the college development committee. “The authorities are delaying the project implementation due to unknown reasons,” Jayachandran said. The plan is to renovate the synthetic track as per the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) standards. This will help Maharaja’s College to get eligibility for hosting international sporting events. Kochi has several advantages for hosting international meets like proximity of airport and accommodation facilities on a par with global standards. AFI had given its provisional licence to Maharaja’s College ground a few years ago. The licence will have to be renewed after completing the renovation of the synthetic track. Physical education department of Maharaja’s College had prepared an estimate for renovating the synthetic track in 2018. As per the estimate, it would cost Rs 6.9 crore for the project. In the first week of October, experts led by Palani Pillai had inspected the synthetic track. “The technical committee meeting for giving suggestions to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) was held. We have handed over all the required documents and provided technical assistance to public works department for preparing the DPR. Now, it is up to the PWD to prepare the DPR,” officials with the college said. Meanwhile, the mayor said that measures would be taken for convening the review meeting within four or five days. According to Kerala Sports Council, it will take two months’ time for completing the renovation once the DPR is approved. Besides renovating the synthetic track, warm-up areas will also be developed. Runways of high jump, long jump and javelin throw should also be renovated. Hockey and basketball courts should be renovated using the remaining funds. The hockey court in the college ground is in a dilapidated condition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/maharajas-synthetic-track-work-moving-at-snails-pace/articleshow/87230116.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Why farmers not paid for acquisition: HC||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court has asked the state government to inform it by November 1 why its officials had failed to pay compensation to three farmers, Ch Narayana Reddy and two others, despite a court order asking them not to dispossess them of their land without rehabilitation and compensation. The bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan gave this direction while hearing two contempt pleas filed by RDO D Vijayender Reddy of Gajwel and B Prabhulu, tahsildar of Kondapaka mandal in Siddipet district who were convicted in a contempt case earlier. The bench also sought replies from the state on questions raised by farmers’ counsel B Rachna Reddy who brought to the notice of the court the absence of a land compensation authority that should be there under section 64 of the new land acquisition Act to attend to the grievances of the farmers. The farmers belong to Pragnapur of Kondapaka mandal and Jaganguda of Shameerpet mandal. Their land was acquired for the construction of the Mallanna Sagar reservoir, which is part of the Kaleswaram irrigation project. “More than Rs 500 crore money that should go to the displaced farmers was lying in the office of the competent authority and the post of presiding officer of this authority-cum-tribunal has been lying vacant for the last three months,” she said. The farmers who feel that the compensation awarded to them is lesser than the price of their property can take the compensation under dissent and the matter gets referred to the competent authority, who will then hear the farmers and the authorities and would pass orders. The state has to deposit the additional compensation in such cases with the authority which will then be distributed to the farmers. “As the post is lying vacant, the farmers are suffering a lot,” she said. State counsel A Sanjeev Kumar said that the post will be filled within a week. The bench sought answers from the state by November 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/why-farmers-not-paid-for-acquisition-hc/articleshow/87230701.cms||---

The victim was identified as Vaibhav Singh Chandel (15), son of Deependra Singh of Kala Ka Purwa, while the accused have been identified as Uday Bhan Singh and Raj Bahadur Singh of Banda district. Police said Deependra, father of Vaibhav, lodged a missing complaint at the Panki Police Station on October 22. On the evening of October 21, Vaibhav had gone to Sunder Nagar in Gangaganj Panki to attend coaching classes. When he did not reach home in the evening, the family members got worried. Later, they launched a frantic search, but to no avail. The next morning, the family informed the police and lodged a missing complaint. Subsequently, the police launched an investigation and at around 7am on Saturday morning, they found the missing Vaibhav's bicycle parked outside a makeshift shop in Bandhua Kala in Panki area. Later, the police questioned the kiosk owner when he came to open the shop at around 9 am, regarding the parked bicycle of Vaibhav. He told police that some people had come in a white coloured SUV, one of them had parked the bicycle here and told him that Vaibhav is coming back in some time. Later, the kiosk owner got suspicious, and noted down the number of the SUV. The police after procuring the registration number of the SUV zeroed in on the suspects. "During investigation, it came to the fore that the vehicle was registered in the name of a person hailing from Banda district," said the police. The police swung into action and reached Banda and on the basis of SUV's number managed to rescue Vaibhav from the clutches of the kidnappers from the jungle of Jari village. The police also arrested two persons in this connection. Additional commissioner of police Anand Prakash Tiwari said that Akash (20), son of one Bhallu Singh, a resident of Kala Ka Purwa, was friendly with the victim Vaibhav as both used to take tuition classes together at a coaching centre. "Later, Akash came to know that Vaibhav's father had sold agricultural land worth Rs 2.5 crores. After this, he hatched a conspiracy and involved his relatives staying in Banda to kidnap Vaibhav. Later Akash's uncle Uday Bhan Singh Raj Bahadur Singh also joined the conspiracy," he added. Commissioner of police Asim Kumar Arun said, "We have rescued the child and arrested two persons in this regard. Police searches are underway to make the arrest of three others possible. We have decided to reward the police team that managed to recover the boy within 24 hours of crime. We have recovered two country-made pistols and two motorcycles and an SUV from the arrested persons."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/abducted-minor-boy-found-by-police-two-held/articleshow/87230706.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Investigation officer can’t question rape victim after her statement to magistrate: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has held that once the victim/prosecutrix in a rape case has recorded her statement before the magistrate and it is different from her statement recorded before the investigation officer (IO), the IO cannot interrogate her again and put specific questions to her pertaining to the two different versions given by her in the two statements. In such a situation, the IO also cannot record her statements and proceed with the investigation further, the court added. In the matters in hand, the prosecutrix/victim after giving her statement under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before the IO levelling allegations of rape against the accused, had changed her version later in her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code before the magistrate. The IO then recorded the statement of the prosecutrix/victim again under Section 161 of the Code and put specific questions to her with regards to the said variations in her statements and recorded her answers to the said questions. Giving this judgement, Justice Samit Gopal observed, “The statement made by the prosecutrix/victim under section 164 of the Code before the magistrate stands on a high pedestal and sanctity during the course of investigation than that of her statement recorded under section 161 of the Code by the investigating officer.” The court observed, “The act of putting specific questions pertaining to the variations in the said two statements by the investigating officer is viewed with an impression of clearly challenging the authority of a judicial act. The IOs have clearly exceeded their jurisdiction by proceedings to investigate in such a manner. The same appears to be with a sole purpose to frustrate the statements recorded by a magistrate.” While deciding this specific point in its judgment dated October 1, the court directed the UP DGP to look into the said new trend of investigation and issue suitable guidelines so that the sanctity and authority of the judicial proceedings are maintained and they should not be frustrated by any act done during investigation. Besides, the court also directed the Registrar (Compliance) of this court and the state government counsel to communicate this order to the DGP, UP, Lucknow for its compliance and necessary action within a period of one month and submit a compliance report within one week thereafter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-after-rape-victim-gives-version-to-magistrate-io-cant-question-her/articleshow/87230711.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Bhopal||MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan transfers Rs 1,540 crore to accounts of 44 lakh farmers||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday said that he reveres and salutes farmers who work day and night for the prosperity of the state. Chouhan transferred Rs1,540 crore to the accounts of 77 lakh farmers under the Mukhyamantri Kisan Kalyan Yojana with a single click at an event held in Minto Hall here in the state capital. Districts where the model code of conduct is in place for the upcoming bypolls were not included in the programme. The state-level programme began with ‘Kanya Pujan’. “After God, farmers are most revered for me. Today, we have adequate foodgrains due to the efforts of the farmers. Farmers are the ‘annadatas’ and ‘bhagya vidhatas’ of the state. The country is indebted to them. I have become the chief minister to bring happiness, peace, comfort and prosperity in the lives of farmers. There will never be any shortage of funds in the government treasury for our farmers”, Chouhan said. Urban development and housing minister Bhupendra Singh and BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma participated in the programme. Farmers, public representatives and officers of 44 districts participated virtually through video conferencing. Chouhan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is committed to the welfare of farmers and to double their income. Chouhan said that before 2003, the total agricultural production of Madhya Pradesh was only 2.14 crore metric tonnes. “Now, the farmers of the state are producing 6 crore metric tonnes of foodgrains. Food production has increased three-fold. The average rate of agricultural growth used to be around 2% to 3% before 2003. Due to the hard work of the farmers and the schemes of the state government, the rate of agricultural growth has now increased to 18%. Due to the efforts of farmers and increase in irrigation capacity, the state has bagged the prestigious Krishi Karman Award seven times”, Chouhan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/shivraj-transfers-rs-1540-cr-to-accounts-of-44l-farmers/articleshow/87230719.cms||---
---||Allahabad||23 candidates arrested from SSC exam centre||Prayagraj: A total of 23 candidates, appearing in the practical skill test for stenographer post conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) on Friday, were arrested by police after suspicion arose as the faces of these candidates did not match with the one shown in the documents of the prelims exam held for this post in December 2020. These candidates were picked up by the police from Abhay Memorial College on Friday under Puramufti police station. An FIR has been registered against the arrested youths at Puramufti police station and the college authorities alleged that those arrested are proxy candidates. According to SP Crime, Ashutosh Mishra, the school staff was conducting the checking of the candidates during the main or practical exams for the post of stenographer recruited by the SSC on Friday, and the authorities noticed the discrepancy in the photographs of the 23 candidates. “The school authorities informed us that during the process of checking the credentials of the candidates, the school manager and magistrate caught 23 such candidates whose photos were not matching from the documents of tier-I (preliminary examination) of the said exams,” said SP Crime. He further informed that on the complaint of the principal of the school, an FIR has been lodged at the Puramufti police station. Mishra also informed that on being asked, these 23 candidates claimed to be genuine. However, what is perplexing is that the candidates claimed that they were the actual candidates and that those who had appeared on their behalf in the tier-I (written) test were the impersonators from the solver gang. The candidates, however, could not answer as to why they didn’t raise the issue earlier and brought this fact to light only after the issue surfaced on the day of the practical exam. The police then arrested the 23 candidates and further investigation is underway to ascertain the credentials of the candidates. Apart from UP, the arrested youths hail from the neighbouring state of Bihar. The arrested accused include Ram Prasad of Patna, Inderjit Kumar Paswan, Saurabh Bhartia and Shakeel. Apart from these, Ramesh Kumar of Soraon, Shyam Babu Yadav, Neeraj Kumar, Sheel Madhur Pal, Vivek Yadav and Amar Singh of Nawabganj, Dhirendra Yadav and Digvijay Singh Patel of Bahria, Pradeep Kumar and Devraj of Phaphamau, Shravan Kumar of Chitrakoot, Sachin of Shivkuti Kumar, Devendra Singh and Akhilendra Singh of Sarainayat, Ravindra Pratap Singh, Krishna Singh and Suraj Kumar of Jhunsi, Ram Abhilash of Mauaima and Ravindra Kumar of Varanasi have been arrested by the police. Police is also investigating the real identity of the arrested accused, as well as the address provided by them. Police said that after questioning all 23 candidates, further course of action will be taken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/23-candidates-arrested-from-ssc-exam-centre/articleshow/87230726.cms||---
---||Kochi||They called me pula**i...: AISF leader Nimisha Raju||By- Nimisha RajuI have been active in student politics for the past nine years and have completed my LLM from the School of Legal Thought of MG University. I had gone to the MG varsity campus on Thursday since it was the election to the university senate and I was in-charge of the sub-committee of AISF, the students wing of CPI, there. I reached the campus along with my friend around 10am and I briefed the AISF councillors about the voting process. We were stationed at a silent area on the campus and the polling was almost getting over. Around 1pm, our polling agent came and joined us. Then, I saw a group of SFI members, including leaders like Arun, who is a personal staff member of the education minister; SFI Ernakulam district president Aarsho and SFI Ernakulam district secretary Amal, walking towards us. Amal is my colleague and Aarsho my classmate. I was meeting them after a long time due to the pandemic, though I had spoken to them over the phone a few times after I left the campus. I went near Amal and talked to him while holding his hand. We spoke for a while and I returned to where I was standing earlier. A few minutes later, an AISF member received a phone call and he walked away from the group. We saw a few people approaching him slowly and they asked him whether he was Sahad. When he said he was Sahad, a person named Prajith K Babu slapped him on his left cheek. I was really shocked as I knew almost everyone standing there, including Prajith, Amal, Aarsho, Deepak and Arun. We had all taken part in several campaigns, held discussions and had food together. As I realized that it was a planned attack, I ran towards them shouting “Eda Adikkalle”. The only word I had said insulting, if so, was “Eda”. When they released Sahad, I held him close to shield him from further attack as he was a small boy. But when I took him towards the police, I was kicked from behind by a person called Shiyaz. When I returned, I saw AISF state joint secretary K Rishiraj being brutally beaten up. Any AISF member found alone was being attacked. When I ran towards Rishi, they abused me, used casteist slur and physically assaulted me. I can’t even write all those abuses they hurled at me. I heard them saying that “Thanthayillatha kunjine ninakku undakki tharum” (Will make you give birth to a bastard) and they called me ‘pula**i’, which stunned me. The moment I heard that, my entire body turned numb. Only bad words came from their mouths. I’m shocked by this anti-women attitude harboured by the SFI men. Then they grabbed me by my shirt, including my left breast. I forced myself out of their hands and guided Rishi towards where the police were standing. On returning I saw Ashokan being beaten up by Amal. I have all this while been working amid SFI, DYFI and CPM members, and with their help too. I believed that if I were in any sort of trouble, the comrades would be there to protect me. But I was being attacked and insulted. I am not sad about being attacked, but about being insulted. It was really painful. Now, how can I confidently tell anyone that LDF workers will protect them when my own experience is different? Anyone who follows Left liberal politics will not do this to a colleague or women. The presence of the RSS is evident in SFI. Some people in that organization are carrying the politics of Sangh Parivar, which SFI should realize and correct. That is my demand. I had mailed a complaint to the Kottayam SP on Thursday night itself and the SP had called me. I informed police that I was at my native Paravur and I was not keeping well due to severe back pain. The party workers took me to a hospital on Saturday. I told the police that it would be difficult for me to travel till Kottayam. They said they will record my statement according to my convenience. The leadership of the CPI, AIYF and AISF are with me. The Communist party is with me. Now, I stay at the CPI office in Paravur. The party workers told me not to remain at home and have asked me to stay in the party office, which for me is like my home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/they-called-me-pulai-/articleshow/87230739.cms||---
---||Pune||Government proposes change in policy to give TDR demand a boost||Pune: The state government recently proposed a change in the transfer of development rights (TDR) policy, under the unified development control and promotion regulation, to boost demand for it. According to the new directive, equal TDR and premium FSI would have to be utilized during construction. The Pune Municipal Corporation and Slum Rehabilitation Authority would be able to use this to speed up the land acquisition for civic projects and SRA schemes. It could also bring down the demand of cash compensation. The rights of finalising the priority between the TDR and premium FSI has been given to the municipal commissioner’s office. The directives would be implemented after the government seeks objections and suggestions from the public for its clearance. “The new directive says that while using the premium FSI, equal amount of TDR should be utilised at each stage of construction,” said Rajendra Nimbalkar, the chief executive officer of SRA. The officials said that as many as 125 projects were in the pipeline, while 60 were underway. Majority of them were dependent on TDR. So, they were either stopped or going on at a slow pace. The TDR rate had gone up to Rs4,500 per sqft during its peak consumption. It had now come down to Rs600 per sq t to Rs1,000 per sqft. A senior PMC official said, the civic body was finding it tough to convince the land owners to give their land and take the TDR instead. “Landowners were insisting on cash compensation as TDR had very low value and low demand. It was hampering land acquisition for civic projects,” the official said. As per PMC officials, big ticket projects such as 24x7 water supply project, riverfront development project, river pollution abatement project and the Chandni Chowk flyover would be benefited by the increase in TDR demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/government-proposes-change-in-policy-to-give-tdr-demand-a-boost/articleshow/87230717.cms||---

Therefore, the prosecution has not proved that the present accused were willing to provide food and clothes to the convicted accused...,” the court said. Among those acquitted are Nasrin Shaikh , Mohammad Kayamuddin, Salma Shaikh, Bushra Khan and Sayyed Allabaksh. The court added that the now-deceased probe officer had not seized the food and clothes allegedly given to the convicted accused. “Therefore, the prosecution has failed to prove charges levelled against the accused that they were part of the unlawful assembly which assaulted the police force and which obstructed the police force while discharging their official duty,” the court said. The court said that there were more than of 50 to 60 persons gathered at the spot but the prosecution has not explained why the remaining persons were not arrested. “Only because the remaining accused are not arrested, these accused cannot get any benefit but the fact remains that in such circumstances, the prosecution has to categorically prove the relationship of present accused with the convicted accused in that case,” the court said. It is the prosecution’s case that on June 1, 2007, the accused were being shifted to other jails for security reasons. It was submitted that the police were transferring 16 accused out of jail and the police van was parked near the gate of the jail. The prosecution said that around 50-60 relatives of the accused came across the police van. They insisted that the police allow them to provide food and clothes to the accused. The officer-in-charge refused the request for security reasons. It was alleged that the relatives created obstacles to oncoming traffic, the police tried to control the mob with light force. The prosecution alleged that the mob became aggressive and had a scuffle with the police. Hence, the accused were taken into custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/5-relatives-of-1993-blast-convicts-who-had-scuffle-with-cops-acquitted-after-14-years-in-mumbai/articleshow/87231912.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Complete adult vaccination, then go in for booster shots: Experts||Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and national task force members have said the country should focus on completing adult population vaccination rather than booster doses. Senior scientist and head of Pune’s ICMR epidemiology and communicable diseases division, Dr Samiran Panda, told TOI on Saturday that even as there are discussions on booster doses, completion of schedule of the two doses of currently administered intramuscular injection preparation of Covid vaccines under the ongoing immunisation programme will yield the necessary protection against advancement of infection or severe form of the disease that may require hospitalization. “The priority should be to complete both doses for eligible adults first and then the plan for children can be firmed up through critical analysis of age group and comorbidities,’‘said Dr Panda. With the country having touched 1 billion vaccine doses on Thursday, he said the way forward was to continue scaling up vaccination and following Covid protocol. The ICMR scientist said that while vaccines are disease modifying vaccines and do not offer protection against acquisition of infection, use of a mask to prevent occurrence of infection was a must for the vaccinated and unvaccinated. He said a combination of prevention against disease severity and acquisition of infection with the help of vaccines and correct as well as consistent use of masks should be the programme emphasis now. “From a public health perspective this is the need of the hour and the priority should be to complete both doses for eligible adults first,” he stressed. He said besides this planning and programmatic steps as pertinent to children and vaccination can be firmed up through critical analysis, such as which age group to cover first, he said ruling out boosters Member of the national task force and National Task Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) Covid task force chairman Dr N K Arora told TOI the country should continue to focus on completing adult population vaccination immediately followed by vaccination of children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/complete-adult-vaccination-then-go-in-for-booster-shots-in-mumbai-experts/articleshow/87231678.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Lack of coordination between the two agencies has resulted into loss of public money. The NMC has proposed complete asphalting of the roads from MLA Hostel Square to RBI Quarters to State Board’s office, Metro Rail office to High Court and Raj Bhavan Square to Katol Road at the cost of Rs 1.43 crore. Tendering process took a month and was completed a couple of days ago. The NMC standing committee on Friday approved work order to the qualified contractor. The NMC, however, did not intimate the state PWD which carries out maintenance of roads in Civil Lines. In view of the criticism over potholes on some of the roads in Civil Lines, the state PWD issued a tender and started repairing of potholes. But the PWD is only doing patch work. On Thursday, the PWD contractor tarred half portion of two sides of the road from MLA Hostel Square to Deshpande hall. Potholes on remaining half portion were filled. Some patch work was also carried between Deshpande Hall and RBI Quarters square. Like in case of total asphalting, defect liability period of these works is three years. When NMC superintending engineer Ajay Pohekar received information, he contacted the PWD engineers and stopped the works. Else, PWD would have carried out the works till Board’s office. Before planning or executing the works, the PWD did not bother to check with the NMC. PWD engineers told TOI that the work was taken up as the road was in bad condition but it was immediately stopped after receiving information from the NMC. In some relief for motorists, the PWD’s national highway division has completed repairing of potholes on Amravati road between Variety Square and Campus Square. An engineer from the department said that the plan is to concretize the road from Variety Square to Wadi, so total asphalting was avoided. “We have submitted the proposal with head office seeking funds. Also, the process has started to construct two flyovers from Bhole Petrol Pump Square to NU Campus Square and from Gurudwara to Wadi,” he said. Along with the NMC, the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has also started its hotmix plant and asphalting of roads in regularized layouts. NIT superintending engineer Leena Upadhyay said, “Plan is to also tar roads in metropolitan region. NIT will resume operation of its second hotmix plant soon. NIT will supply tar to the NMC for expediting the road repair works,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pwd-asphalts-part-of-road-selected-by-nmc-for-tarring/articleshow/87230743.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The sleuths arrested six people and seized three kilograms of high quality synthetic drugs and marijuana. In the first incident, the Hyderabad sub-zone of NCB intercepted a parcel and seized three kilograms of pseudoephedrine, which was concealed in the falls line areas of three skirts, the NCB’s Bengaluru zonal unit director Amit Ghawate said in a statement. “The contraband was well concealed to avoid detection by the enforcement agency. The parcel was being sent to Australia,” Ghawate said in a statement. The NCB nabbed the consignor from Chennai. In another case, four people were arrested at Devanahalli in Bengaluru when they were on their way to Hyderabad with commercial quantity of Ecstasy pills, Methamphetamin and Methaqualone, the officer said. The accused are from Vishakhapatnam, Bihar and Hyderabad. Their fifth accomplice was the supplier of high quality marijuana, who too has been arrested on a tip-off, the NCB officer said. “The syndicate was procuring a variety of drugs from supplier based in Bengaluru and sold them at parties and in pubs in Hyderabad,” Ghawate said.

---||Kochi||The Personal Is Also Political||To begin with, there is the question of a mother’s inalienable right to her infant. The way the Child Welfare Committee and the police were prevented from doing due diligence in Anupama’s case is a serious crime and certain CPM leaders’ collusion in it is unmistakable. However, the far more serious issue is the routinely patronising manner in which CPM views women and Dalits — yes, recognising both sections as historically oppressed but justice for whom can happen only in the manner and pace prescribed by the party. In the campus violence in Kottayam, Nimisha was assaulted because she — a woman and a Dalit, a double delinquency, as it were — had the temerity to question SFI, the self-proclaimed arbiters of righteous politics. In Anupama’s case too, the same dynamics is to blame but is more insidious because it played out in the personal space. A ‘traditional’ CPM family couldn’t stomach the fact that their daughter would elope with a Dalit and have a child out of wedlock. Once the child was born, the family’s concern was less for the black sheep in the family (Anupama) than for their younger unwed daughter whose prospects of middle class marital bliss was now threatened. When it comes to their own private privileges and prejudices, the Left is notorious for the same social conformism as their politically more conservative rivals. The CPM has never recognised the fact the ‘personal’ is ‘political’ too. So, who is the party trying to fool when it advertises itself as ‘progressive’ and for being on ‘the right side of history’?||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/the-personal-is-also-political/articleshow/87230755.cms||---

From Kanna Reddy’s lodge, 921 grams of mephedrone was recovered. When he was grilled about the source of the drug, he allegedly claimed that he got the drug from Rama Krishna from Nagarkurnool district. When Kanna Reddy was trapped by the officials, Krishna came in his car to deliver the contraband. During the searches, officials have recovered four kg of mephedrone. Police were on the manhunt for Suresh Reddy and Hanumanth Reddy.

---||World||Colombia's most-wanted drug lord 'Otoniel' captured||BOGOTA: Colombia's most-wanted drug trafficker, Dairo Antonio Usuga, also known as "Otoniel," was arrested by the country's authorities, the government said Saturday. Presidential adviser Emilio Archila praised "the capture in Necocli of Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias 'Otoniel,' head of the Gulf Clan," in a message on Twitter. The gang is the most powerful among Colombia's drug traffickers. The capture of the head of the Colombia's largest narcotrafficking gang signals a major victory for the conservative government of President Ivan Duque, whose country is the world's top cocaine exporter. The United States had offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Otoniel, who at age 50 is one of the most feared men in Colombia. Otoniel took over the leadership of the Gulf Clan, previously known as the Usuga Clan, from his brother Juan de Dios, who was killed by police in 2012. The gang is present in almost 300 municipalities in the country, according to the independent think tank Indepaz. The capo was captured in Necocli, one of the Gulf Clan's main outposts, located near the border with Panama. The organization has been decimated recently by authorities, with the inner circle reduced to hiding in the jungle without telephones, according to police. Colombia is the world's top provider of cocaine, with the United States as its principal market, despite half a century of trying to clamp down on the drug trade. In remote areas where there is little government presence, criminal groups like the Gulf Clan, dissident FARC guerrillas and leftist ELN rebels engage in bloody turf battles over control of drug trafficking corridors and illegal mining operations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/colombias-most-wanted-drug-lord-otoniel-captured/articleshow/87232121.cms||---

The 65-year-old had been hospitalised for the last 10 days. Over the last two-and-a-half decades, Patel had played a crucial role in tipping off law enforcement agencies about wrongdoings of personnel from Mhada, BMC, state excise, sales tax and income tax departments, fire brigade, and railway protection force police. Most of them were caught for demanding bribe. Out of these 121 people, 35 were fraudsters who posed as government officers. Patel is survived by his wife, and two sons, Bhavesh (36) and Nikunj (33), and a daughter who is married. Patel, who originally hailed from Kutch in Gujarat, came to Mumbai in 1980s. “My father began working as a delivery boy at a grocery superstore in Sakinaka,” said Bhavesh. Today, the family owns a wine shop at Nariman Point, as well as a superstore and medical shop at Cuffe Parade. Patel had earlier told TOI that he felt “relieved” every time he trapped people on the wrong side of the law. He had received more than 100 cash rewards and certificates from government agencies for his work. He had added that despite not being well educated, he was “tech savvy” and had “all the modern gadgets to tape, video-record and conduct sting operations”. “Even if someone asked at night for any help, my father would extend his helping hand,” Bhavesh added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-65-yr-old-who-tried-to-end-graft-in-city-passes-away/articleshow/87231916.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Pune||IMD associates delayed monsoon withdrawal to increasing convective rainfall, sea temperatures||PUNE: The IMD has in its latest study decoded the delayed monsoon withdrawal from India in the recent years associated with the increasing convective rainfall in parts of the country and also the Indian seas getting warmer in the last two decades. The example of this was the intense rain from a retreating monsoon that recently battered Uttarakhand and Kerala. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) study was recently published in a reputed international journal, “Pure and Applied Geophysics” by Springer. In its 40-year analysis (1980 to 1999 and 2000 to 2019), the IMD has found a warming trend over the Indian seas in the recent two decades. Senior scientist D R Pattanaik from the IMD, also the chief researcher for the study, told TOI, “The mean sea surface temperature over the north Indian Ocean has been higher during the last two decades in comparison to the 1980-1999 period . The inter-annual variability of sea surface temperatures shows a significant increasing trend over both, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal with a comparatively higher rate of increase over the Arabian Sea.” He said, “Another aspect that is very clearly seen is that the increasing trend of sea surface temperature over the north Arabian Sea has a slightly higher rate (0.09 degrees C/decade) compared to the corresponding increase in the sea surface temperature trends over the north Bay of Bengal (0.07 degrees C/decade). Similarly, the rate of increasing trend of sea surface temperature over south Arabian Sea (0.11 degrees C/decade) is also higher compared to that over south Bay of Bengal (0.09 degrees C/decade).” The study further noted that the increasing trend of sea surface temperature, particularly over the north and south Arabian Sea, was associated with a decreasing trend of longwave radiation over the study regions, which they correlated to increased cloud cover, causing a rise in convective rain events. Associated with this, convective rainfall (intense rain spells with thunder, lightning) has also increased during the last two decades over the region associated with the increase of moist convective instability. The analysis also indicated that there is a rapid progress of monsoon to the north after its onset over the southern tip of India, leading to early monsoon onset over northern India along with delayed withdrawal of monsoon from northwest India during the recent two decades (2000 to 2019). This is due to the increasing convective activity over the north Arabian Sea and neighbourhood during the onset and withdrawal phases of monsoon. The study also found an increase in convective rainfall over north Arabian Sea, particularly during the onset phase of June, leading to a rapid progress of monsoon to the north after the onset over southern tip of India. Similar increase in convective rain over both the north and south Arabian Sea was also noticed during the withdrawal phase of September in the recent period, leading to the delay in withdrawal of monsoon from northwest India in recent time. Pattanaik told TOI that earlier studies had already established that heavy rainfall events increased in southwest monsoon season from June to September, associated with the increasing trend of moist convective instability. This year too, commencement of monsoon withdrawal from extreme northwest India began on October 6 as against the normal date of September 17. As on Saturday, monsoon was yet to withdraw from parts of peninsular India as against the normal exit date of October 15.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/imd-associates-delayed-monsoon-withdrawal-to-increasing-convective-rainfall-sea-temps/articleshow/87230762.cms||Neha Madaan

The yatra, led by party leader Acharya Pramod Krishnan, will cover seven assembly constituencies of the district over the next two days and also various districts of western UP, ending on November 1 after reaching Mathura. While interacting with the media, Congress leader Muzaffar Ali Naqvi said, "The yatra has been started to create mass awareness against BJP misrule. The same yatra was kicked off in Barabanki, Varanasi and Saharanpur collectively on Saturday. Congress has worked to provide women a respectable status in society. This is reflected in the party’s promise to provide 40% tickets to women in the next assembly elections in UP.” Congress national secretary Imran Masood added, "We aim to bring good governance by ending BJP's misrule. Congress does not indulge in caste politics and is a party of all castes and religions. Through the yatra, we will be spreading the message of development for farmers and labourers.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/cong-kickstarts-pratigya-yatra-from-behat-in-saharanpur/articleshow/87230163.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Satheesan alleged that the CPM activists and leaders were taking law into their hands, and this was the reason why a mother had to launch a fast to get her own child back in front of the secretariat, despite the fact that she is a former SFI activist. Satheesan told reporters at Irinjalakuda that the CWC had indulged in blatant violation of the laws and procedures prevailing in the country in relation to child adoption. The Government of India has issued a notification on the process and procedures to be followed for adoption of babies, as part of the Juvenile Justice Act. “It is an elaborate procedure. But all these procedures and rules have been violated in the case of the adoption of the baby of Anupama. The CWC officials have no right to remain in that position even for a single minute. This adoption is a criminal offence, and those involved should be punished after thorough investigation,” he said. “The mother of the baby had complained to various leaders like P K Sreemathi and Anavoor Nagappan. Sreemathi has conceded that she had alerted the chief minister’s political secretary. The complaints had reached the CM’s office as well as the offices of the ministers of social justice and child welfare, the police, as well as the top leaders of the CPM. The police did not even register an FIR. All of them had remained silent then, and now the CPM secretary, the minister for child welfare and others are pretending to be acting because the issue has received media attention. Where were all these people six months ago when the complaint was originally raised. Several CPM leaders were involved in the manipulations related to the adoption of Anupama’s baby,” Satheesan alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/dissolve-cwc-says-satheesan/articleshow/87230781.cms||---

The move is expected to help authorities while issuing new route permits to buses. Once implemented, all details regarding buses can be available just in a click . “When a bus operator approaches the vehicles department for a new permit, we have to go through all the records of other buses on that route and it is a time consuming process. With the digitalization, we can know the interval between the services of buses on that route. We can issue new permit without disturbing the timing of other buses. For example, if a bus is operating from Kochi to Kodungallur at 9am and the second one at 9.30am, we can issue a permit for a new bus at 9.15am, which will help passengers,” said an MVD official. It will also help to track a bus immediately if it failed to follow the time and route, if a passenger complains. However, officials said that records of many buses, which have been operating for many years, might have been lost and records of only 80% of buses can be digitalized. M B Sathyan, general secretary of private bus operators’ association, said around 1,200 buses operate in Ernakulam RTO limit and many are not conducting services due to financial crisis caused by the Covid pandemic. Though private buses have resumed service, many either suspend service before afternoon or midway on many days due to poor passenger turnout.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/mvd-to-digitalize-route-mgmt-system-for-buses/articleshow/87230159.cms||T C Sreemol

Speaking to TOI exclusively ahead of TRS’ celebrations of completing 20 years, KTR refused to accept that his party’s biggest challenge comes from the BJP. “For those who are saying BJP is growing in Telangana, remember that they did not secure their deposit in Nagarjuna Sagar byelection and lost their sitting MLC from Hyderabad,” he said. “In the 2018 polls, of the 119 seats contested, they lost deposits in 105.” “There is a saying ‘Addimar Guddi Debba’ which means it happens just accidentally. In BJP’s case, it is no different and helped them get four seats in Lok Sabha. In Dubbak too the BJP won with a 1,000-vote majority because of confusion over symbols,” he added. He opined people in public life should maintain dignity. “But some leaders use objectionable language against our CM. They should know that every action has equal and opposite reaction,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ktr-calls-state-bjp-mps-accidental-incidental/articleshow/87231256.cms||Koride Mahesh

Temples, dams and other heritage structures were also common in the currency. It is a great feeling of joy and satisfaction that after 80 years this event is being conducted in Hyderabad. This conference last happened in Hyderabad in the year 1941,” said Anuradha Reddy, co-convener, INTACH Telangana. Meanwhile, the 103rd annual conference of Numismatic Society of India held at the Salarjung Museum also transported people to the olden days and educated them about the usage of the money then. JP Dash, chief general manager at India Government Mint said, “The event has received an overwhelming response. People from different places have arrived and exhibited rare collections. It is also hidden history and heritage.” One of the participants, Shaik Ibrahim from Hyderabad, who came with Nizam era coins, notes and stamps said, “I have presented Hyderabad’s history in stamps, postal stamps, revenue stamps and stamp papers.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana Rashtra Samithi has reinvented itself in past 20 years: KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD:  The Telangana Rashtra Samithi, which was founded 20 years ago on the banks of Hussainsagar (Jala Drushyam) with the sole motive of achieving a separate Telangana state, has emerged as a major political force in the state. As the party celebrates its plenary on Monday, party working president KT Rama Rao speaks about its journey and future plans with Koride Mahesh. Excerpts from the interview.How do you see the two-decade journey of TRS?In the history of united Andhra Pradesh, only two parties have successfully been able to capture the hot seat (CM’s post) and win the laurels of the people. One is NT Rama Rao’s TDP which, of course, is irrelevant in Telangana now and the other party is KCR’s TRS. We started with the goal to achieve separate statehood for Telangana and later transformed into a political party. Telangana’s welfare schemes and performance have become a benchmark for the entire country and legislators of neighbouring states are asking their governments to implement Telangana’s schemes in their states or merge the areas with Telangana. Isn’t it time for the TRS to reinvent itself now that Telangana has been achieved?In fact, we have successfully reinvented ourselves in the past few years. We have proved our administrative capabilities in the last seven years. TRS has proven that both development and welfare can go together. There was a smear campaign against the TRS during the separate statehood movement. We said we are dividing geographically but not as a people. Even those who settled here from various parts of the country support us now. KCR has already made it clear that the government is not going for an early poll. It seems that the party is bringing in structural changes in the next few months. You have openly admired DMK’s organisational structure in Tamil Nadu.There are certain aspects of DMK’s structure that I would definitely like to incorporate in TRS. For instance, they have a party office at every village and their workers are extremely loyal to them. They have survived for 65 to 70 years continuously and become an institution. That is how we would like to see TRS grow in Telangana - it should grow beyond the individual. In the next eight to nine months, TRS is planning many organisational activities like holding training camps for all MLAs, MPs, MLCs and other leaders in a phased manner. We also plan to inaugurate our party offices at the taluka level and then go down to the village level. KCR spoke about the federal front before 2019 Lok Sabha polls. There is no mention of it now.We spoke about the federal front to bring all like-minded parties to protect the federal fabric of the country and strengthen it. Unfortunately, we could not get the expected seats (in Lok Sabha) and BJP came to power. However, our main focus is on Telangana and its development. Even if you ask DMK’s Stalin, YSRC’s Jagan, BJD’s Naveen Patnaik and TMC chief Mamata Bannerjee, they will say their first priority and focus will be Tamil Nadu, AP, Odisha and West Bengal. Congress has alleged that KCR moves closely with PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah and supports them in approving crucial laws in Parliament but criticises them in Telangana. TRS is maintaining some constitutional obligations and our CM meets the PM and HM on state’s interests and projects and to demand implementation of promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act. But, we have never compromised on the state’s interests and never hesitated to criticise the Centre. The BJP government is discriminatory when it comes to Telangana’s projects. For instance, they did not give us the industrial defence corridor. We had asked for national status to Kaleshwaram project, but the Centre gave the national status to Bhadra project on upper Krishna. We asked for a rail coach factory in Kazipet, which was given to Latur. I say once again, government-to-government relations have got nothing do with politics. You seem to be encouraging young leaders after the debacle in Dubbak.That is not correct. We have always encouraged youth. KCR gave tickets to youth leaders like Balka Suman, Gadari Kishore and Vemula Prashanth Reddy. Many young leaders, like Harish Rao and myself, emerged because of KCR.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-has-reinvented-itself-in-past-20-years-ktr/articleshow/87231103.cms||Koride Mahesh

Toughening his stand, the CM said apart from arresting the cultivators and taking a strict legal action, the government would cancel their Recognition of Forest Rights (RoFR) land pattas. At a review meeting with district collectors, forest and revenue officials on podu land and protection of forest land at Pragati Bhavan on Saturday, KCR said 87 per cent of encroachment of podu land was reported from 12 districts of the state. Bhadradri Kothagudem, Kumaram Bheem Asifabad, Adilabad, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Kamareddy, Khammam, Nirmal, Warangal, Nalgonda and Nizamabad seen huge encroachments of podu land. He asked the officials to accept claims on podu land between November 8 and December 8 as promised in the legislative assembly. “The claims should be accepted from tribals doing podu land cultivation. Before November 8, a preparatory meeting will be held.” KCR asked the officials to constitute village committees as per the RoFR Act. A nodal officer will be appointed for two to three villages and an RDO at the sub-division level and collector at the district level will monitor the process. The chief minister said a stretch of 10 acres of forest was much more precious than lakhs of trees. “One may plant crores of trees under the social forestry programme but it can never match a forest.” The forest revival programme should be implemented in all the districts on the lines of Gajwel. Directing the collectors to convene an all-party meeting on the podu land issues and protection of forest land, the CM said there should be a unanimous opinion on extending RoFR to those already doing podu cultivation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ganja-growers-will-lose-govt-sops-warns-kcr/articleshow/87231273.cms||Koride Mahesh

This decision was taken after an inspection conducted at the dump yard by MA&UD special chief secretary Arvind Kumar, GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalaxmi and commissioner Lokesh Kumar on Saturday. The orders for inspection were issued by MAUD minister KT Rama Rao after the residents from the surrounding area reached out to authorities for a permanent solution, earlier this week. “Inspected and reviewed Jawaharnagar dump yard as directed by minister @KTRTRS today. Immediate action points – drones to take up spraying immediately, bring down pile up stocks among others. (sic),” Kumar tweeted.

This, after their names were deleted from the voters list, keeping with the Supreme Court order of 2018. The order stated that people who have illegally built houses on defence land will not be given the right to vote in Cantonment Board elections. “It is over five decades ago that these people put up temporary huts (shelters) on open lands as they did not have idea that this property belonged to the defence. Gradually, they built some permanent structures on the same premises too,” said an official from SCB’s engineering wing. Though several attempts were made by former SCB ward members, urging the MoD to recognise them as voters and enrol their names on the voters list, their efforts failed to yield any result. “After the SC issued orders to remove their names from the voters list, did these people realise they have encroached upon defence land. But now we can't do anything, except follow SC orders,” the official added. TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/28k-deleted-from-list-post-sc-order/articleshow/87231053.cms||---

A street vendor who saw the body inside the car alerted the Hayathnagar police, following which the police rushed to the spot. It is suspected that the victim’s wife and brother are behind the murder. Hayathnagar police said that the victim, a lorry driver, died after he was allegedly attacked on the head and his throat was slit with a sharp-edged weapon. Based on the Call Data Records (CDR) of the victim and CCTV footage, police came in touch with a lorry owner, who provided the details about the victim’s family. The family later identified the victim. Police said the victim was last seen in the company of his brother. During investigation, police found out that the victim had suspected his wife of having a relationship with his brother. “It looks like the victim’s wife and his brother conspired to kill him. The victim was invited by his brother for a drink. The suspects made the victim drink until he fell asleep. The accused took the victim to Batasingaram forest and killed him. They then took the body to Hayathnagar main road, parked the vehicle and fled,” police told TOI. Police said that the suspects are being interrogated about the murder.

---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: Delhi HC refuses bail to CBI cop, advocate||NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has dismissed bail pleas of CBI official Abhishek Tiwari and an advocate, who were arrested in connection with an alleged leak of the investigative agency’s preliminary enquiry (PE) report in a corruption case against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The high court said it was not inclined to grant relief as the investigation is at its initial stage. It said it is settled law that the court has to keep in mind not only the nature of accusations but also, if there exists reasonable apprehension of the evidence being tampered with, bail may be refused. “The allegation in the present FIR is rather based on tampering of the evidence; thus considering the initial stage of investigation, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioners herein, at this stage. The petition(s) stands dismissed,” Justice Yogesh Khanna said. The court passed a common order on the bail pleas of Tiwari and Nagpur-based advocate Anand Dilip Daga. The CBI had registered a case against its sub-inspector Tiwari, advocate Daga, who was working as a lawyer for Deshmukh, and others on various allegations, including illegal gratification. Daga was arrested for allegedly trying to subvert the Bombay high court-directed PE against Deshmukh. A report of the PE, purportedly giving a clean chit to Deshmukh, was leaked earlier, causing embarrassment to the agency. The counsel for the two accused submitted that only four days remand was given to the CBI and thereafter, the trial court had refused further remand. However, the two men have been in custody for 40 days, and yet the agency did not even file an application for interviewing them, the counsel argued, adding that hence, the accused are not required for further investigation and ought to be granted bail. The CBI told the court that no investigation can proceed if the accused’s lawyer and the investigating officer join hands to benefit someone. The investigation is still at its initial stage and the accused may influence the investigation and tamper with the evidence and shall stall the proceedings, if allowed to be released on bail at this stage, the agency said. “Attempts by Anil Deshmukh’s team were in contempt of the Bombay high court which had directed that all concerned should fully cooperate with the CBI while conducting the PE. In this case, it has appeared that Deshmukh’s team tried to subvert the PE,” the CBI had said. The CBI had booked Deshmukh and others for criminal conspiracy and corruption. The FIR alleged that Deshmukh “and others” exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials. Allegations against Deshmukh had surfaced after the removal of former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh.pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/anil-deshmukh-case-delhi-hc-refuses-bail-to-cbi-cop-advocate-in-mumbai/articleshow/87231932.cms||---

When the youth refused, the hacker posted an obscene picture of an unknown woman on his account. A complaint in this regard was lodged at the Ahmedabad (rural) cybercrime police station. The youth stated that the social media account in question was about two years old and he had posted photographs on it. He said that on May 31, he got a call message saying his account was hacked and if he wanted to get control of it back he shoudl pay Rs 7,000. The hacker even provided his UPI ID: sharadpatel18649@okicici. The complainant stated that the hacker threatened to post obscene pictures from his profile and to defame him. The complainant lodged an FIR on Friday and produced screenshots of his chat with the hacker. In another complaint at the Ahmedabad (rural) cybercrime police station, a 19-year-old resident of Dholka stated that an unknown person was harassing him after hacking into his account by sending messages to the complainant’s mother and sister.

---||Hyderabad||Still no clarity on Secunderabad Cantonment Board polls, photo electoral rolls||SECUNDERABAD: It’s been a year since the Secunderabad Cantonment Board completed its five-year tenure. Yet, there is still no clarity on just when the elections to this body will be held next. This, even as neighbouring GHMC has already conducted its polls, as per schedule. Not only has the ministry of defence (MoD) not issued an election notification so far for SCB, it has also not clarified how the polls will be conducted — on party lines or on free symbols. In fact, post the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, there has been a growing demand among major parties to conduct the ensuing SCB polls on party lines. This apart, there is another demand that continues to remain unfulfilled — of photo electoral rolls “It is the most important thing that MoD has to implement in the ensuing elections to avoid foul play,” said B Venugopal, a retired railway employee, who has participated in four Board elections so far. “When the photo electoral rolls are being implemented by the Election Commission of India (ECI) for both Assembly and Lok Sabha elections then why is MoD not implementing the same for Cantonment Board elections in the country,” asked M N Prakash, an IT professional. He could not cast his vote in the last elections as somebody had utilised it. To avoid this duplication of voters and ensure that Cantonment Board elections take place smoothly, MoD must issue the orders to the SCB, some voters in ward no-VI said. “Photo IDs are important to maintain transparency,” said a first-time voter. When asked about the polls, SCB officials said that they are ready to conduct it as soon as they get a go-ahead. “We have completed the process of final electoral rolls and short-listed polling stations. We are absolutely ready to conduct Board polls,” said an official adding, “Implementation of photo electoral rolls in the ensuing elections is a decision that has to be taken by the MoD.” The SCB has a voter base of 1.29 lakh. Further, in its new Cantonment Act, 2020 MoD has proposed that elections will be held for the post of vice-president too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/still-no-clarity-on-scb-polls-photo-electoral-rolls/articleshow/87231039.cms||Sunil Mungara

In the last few days, several residents from areas such as Miyapur, Nizampet, KPHB, Nallagandla, Madinaguda, Chandanagar and Bachupally have raised issue over pungent odour forcing them to stay indoors. Residents suspect that industrial units in Bachupally, Jeedimetla and Kukatpally may be discharging emissions, leading to massive air pollution. “The situation is so bad that even taking a stroll in the park has become difficult for us,” said PJ Reddy, vice-president of Welfare Association of Rain Tree Park in KPHB. In the last 11 years, several residents have sent multiple representations to the PCB, staged protests and have also moved court seeking shifting of the industrial units. Following multiple complaints from residents in the last few days, TSPCB has deployed three night patrolling teams in these areas to assess the ground realities. “ There are clusters of industrial units around these areas where there are close to 250 chemical units. We are monitoring these industries and immediately reaching spots from where we are getting complaints,” said BV Bhadra Girish, senior environmental engineer at TSPCB. The matter was also discussed by TSPCB member secretary Neetu Singh with concerned department officials on October 21. TSPCB will identify units that are flouting norms and would be initiating action against them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/residents-unite-to-fight-air-pollution-along-it-corridor/articleshow/87231064.cms||Preeti Biswas

A video of an SUV driver stealing a potted champa plant from outside a café on Old Padra Road on early Saturday morning went viral on social media. Video of SUV owner stealing potted plant in Vadodara goes viralThe café owner too was perplexed why the man chose the specific plant of the various plants kept outside the café. “It is possible that the person may be a kleptomaniac, but we are not holding any grudges. In fact, we have posted on our social media page that if anyone helps us in finding the man we will give them free coffee, but if this man will also come to return the pot we will treat him with a coffee,” said Kashyap Jain, the owner of Brew 13 café. Jain had initially posted on the café’s social media page about the incident following which the video of the act caught on CCTV became viral. In the video, the man is seen talking on his mobile phone while loitering outside the café. A couple of morning walkers are also seen walking past him, but at a moment when he sees no one approaching in the direction of the café, he opens the boot of his car while continuing to talk on the phone for a couple of minutes more. After hanging up the phone, he looks around and walks towards the pot. After picking up the pot, he runs towards the car and keeps it in the boot before speeding off from there. “It was just a champa plant and not any exotic plant. I don’t know why he chose only that plant and not any other,” said Jain. He added that he did not even try looking for the car’s registration plate since it was just a plant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/man-in-suv-steals-potted-champa-plant-outside-caf/articleshow/87229924.cms||---

An agreement to this effect will also be inked by the top bosses of DFC and Biological E in Hyderabad on Monday. While DFC’s chief operating officer David Marchick will be signing on the odtted line on behalf of the US government’s financing body, Biological E’s managing director Mahima Datla will be inking the pact on behalf of the company. Officials of the US consulate as well as DFC will also be visiting Biological E’s facilities in Genome Valley later in the day. The formalisation of the financing agreement comes over six months after the US government announced its decision to offer financial assistance to the Indian vaccine maker after the Quad Leaders Summit that was held virtually in March 2021. Biological E has already been roped in by US pharma major Johnson & Johnson to manufacture over 500 million doses per annum of its Covid-19 vaccine.The company is also developing its own recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) protein SARS-CoV-2 vaccine called Corbevax in collaboration with the Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) for which it is targeting a production of up to 100 million doses per month in early 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bio-e-gets-50-million-boost-from-us-dfc-to-up-vaccine-output/articleshow/87231081.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

When contacted, Dr Anurag Agrawal, director at CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi, said, “AY.4.2 is present in India based on the revised definition, but at very low numbers, less than 0.1%.” IGIB is one of the main laboratories involved in the INSACOG genomic surveillance exercise. Dr Agrawal said further details and the exact number of AY.4.2 in India would be available soon. AY.4.2 is a descendant of the Delta variant, which has so far been considered the most dangerous form, affecting millions. Read AlsoCovid: 7 cases of new Delta variant found in Indore; two are Army officersSeven cases of a new Covid variant, AY.4 — a sub-lineage of the Delta variant — have been detected in Indore in a genome sequencing report released from National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC).Delta has been studied closely using genome sequencing since early this year and its tribe has extends up to AY.39. The lineage AY.4 was considered the fastest growing in many continents, including India, in the last three months until the UK health authorities earlier this week announced the spread of AY.4.2. The UK health authorities have named AY.4.2 as a “variant under investigation” that “appears to have a modestly increased growth rate compared to Delta”. The AY.4.2 lineage has mutations of Delta and Delta derivative AY.4 and has spike mutations A222V and Y145H that help the virus enter human cells more easily. The UK, which has the biggest database on AY.4.2 has started comparative analyses of deaths, hospitalization and vaccine effectiveness. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the Maharashtra government’s task force on Covid-19, said Delta and its derivatives have posed a challenge to the medical community for months. “India is still in the Delta mode. As long as the Delta variant is still dominant, it is unlikely that any of derivatives such as AY.4.2 will pose a big threat to India,” said Dr Joshi. Recent studies have shown that the Oxford vaccine, sold as Covidshield in India, is effective against Delta. The third genomic sequencing report of the BMC in Mumbai showed that while breakthrough infections (getting Covid despite vaccination) have been noted, the vaccine has resulted in lower number of hospitalisations, disease severity and deaths.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ay-4-2-is-a-descendant-of-delta-variant-spreads-faster/articleshow/87231282.cms||Malathy Iyer

However, the segment (superstructure) did not fall as the width of the pier reportedly wider. In the Pardi incident, the over 1,000-tonne span between pier No. 7 and 8 fell on the road after detaching from pier No. 7. The other end of the segment towards pier No. 8 is still holding up. These piers are part of the flyover being constructed between Kalamna and HB Town square. Terming the Pardi incident as “rarest”, an NHAI official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “A similar incident took place for the first time in an NHAI project in Vidarbha at Lakhani on the Bhandara-Raipur route. The segment moved from its original place upwards (against the slope). As the width of the pier is 3.6 metres, the segment did not fall. Studies were conducted but nothing came of it. Later, the segment was put back in its original place and, now, the flyover is nearing completion.” The width of the pier in Pardi is smaller at 2.7 metres as it is a four-lane route while at Lakhani it is a six-lane. “The flyover is on an incline from pier No. 7 to 8. Pier No. 8 is 13.5cm taller than pier No. 7. The segment got detached and moved towards pier No. 8 and hit the segment placed between pier No. 8 and 9. Therefore, the segment slipped off pier No. 7. It’s a rarest of rare occurrence as the segment moved upwards. Even a downward movement does not usually happen,” said the NHAI official. A member of NHAI’s three-member committee to investigate the collapse, Vinay Gupta — the CEO of Tandon Consultants, inspected the Pardi spot. According to an NHAI official, “Gupta too was surprised to see the segment had moved upwards.” As per NHAI’s press release, the segment was placed on January 20, 2018. “The segment was of M-55 concrete grade and no indications were seen between January 2018 and till date of any problems. No work was being undertaken near these piers,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pardi-flyover-like-fault-at-lakhani-but-no-fall/articleshow/87230792.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The state minister for relief and rehabilitation said that if everything goes according to plan then coaching institutes may get permission before Diwali. Representatives from coaching associations had met Wadettiwar earlier and given a memorandum for reopening. Wadettiwar said, “Their request for reopening is being considered. I have asked officials to move that file forward. Our plan is to grant them reopening permission before Diwali.” With almost everything now open in Maharashtra, coaching institutes find themselves not only locked out but also ignored. TOI spoke to a few coaching institutes but they did not wish to be identified as they felt that their sector was being discriminated against. A coaching institute owner said, “It seems that the chief minister’s office (CMO), which ultimately gives permission for reopening, does not even acknowledge our presence. Earlier this month they gave a roadmap for reopening of schools and cinema halls, which have already been implemented. But there was no mention about our coaching classes.” Another institute owner said that CMO is being ‘ultra defensive’. “The Covid Task Force seems to be wielding a strong influence on the CMO. We are unhappy because they are treating us like we don’t even exist. At least acknowledge our problem, the solution can come later,” said the owner. On Saturday morning, before Wadettiwar’s statement came in, TOI contacted the Covid Task Force’s Dr Shashank Joshi. He said that “at present” coaching institutes are not under consideration for issuing of safety guidelines. Coaching institutes hope that after Wadettiwar’s push, things may change. “Once we become part of the discussion agenda, then things will move fast. Our members have been meeting various ministers, writing to the CMO but nothing concrete has happened. In this context, Wadettiwar’s statement comes as a glimmer of hope,” said a coaching institute owner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/will-try-to-reopen-coaching-institutes-before-diwali-min/articleshow/87230204.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Revanth said that the paddy production had gone up in Huzurabad assembly constituency and the combined Karimnagar district due to Sri Ram Sagar project (SRSP) completed by the previous Congress government. ”Every village in Telangana has Indiramma houses sanctioned by the previous Congress governments. But the TRS government has not constructed its promised 2-BHK houses in a majority of the assembly constituencies, including Huzurabad in the state,” Revanth said. Revanth admitted that Congress delayed the announcement of its contesting candidate, Balmoor Venkat, and said the young student leader was not only a doctor but has the capacity to fight for the cause of the people of Huzurabad for the next 40 years. The TPCC chief appealed to the people to vote Balmoor Venkat to victory by rejecting TRS and BJP as they were two sides of the same coin. “Our children need jobs, which will give them Rs 40,000-50,000 monthly salaries. Then, their parents will not need the Rs 2,016 Aasara pensions being given by the government. Instead, they would be in a position to extend such sought of financial help to the needy every month, Eatala Rajender is only trying to save his skin,” Revanth said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/need-jobs-not-aasara-pension-revanth/articleshow/87230206.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As is now well-known, this young woman’s parents took away her baby days after she had given birth to it and offered it up for adoption. They disapproved of their daughter’s choice of a partner and apparently because another daughter was getting married. The young couple knocked at every door seeking their baby, to no avail. When their search looked increasingly futile, they made their agony public. The one time of her life when the human female needs most help is childbirth. To be betrayed by one’s own parents at such a time seems the most indescribable of agonies. Now, this would not have caused any surprise in Kerala, though the better of Malayalis would have sympathized with the aggrieved young parents. Far from being progressive in social relations, the Malayali middle classes have tenaciously clung to caste and community endogamy even as they actively sought education and modern health care. It is not a coincidence that the paranoia about the breakdown of endogamy, best expressed in the bogey of ‘love jihad’, has been most intensely expressed here. However, Anupama is not the average young woman hedged in by Kerala’s deeply conservative community authorities. Rather, she is a child of the community that has grown around Kerala’s Left. Her parents are both members of the CPM; her father is a local leader. She herself was an active member of the SFI; the man she chose is a DYFI leader. Her parents had married across communities. Faced with the intransigence of the local police and child welfare authorities, she had turned to the CPM leadership for help, including such advocates of women’s rights in the party as Brinda Karat. This has been noticed in the public debate -- that this criminal obsession with endogamy and ‘respectability’ happened in an ostensibly progressive family in allegiance to the CPM that has consistently claimed for itself the legacy of humanism in Kerala’s socio-cultural ‘awakening’ of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, as someone who has watched the Left in Kerala for some decades now, I can only say that this is somewhat misleading. Whatever it may claim about owning the legacy of humanism, the CPM’s actions – of its cadres and its leaders – have very often reeked of casteism and the most shameful patriarchy. The ‘secularised casteism’ which has been so very common in the CPM is quite evident in this incident as well: it is easy for the parents to claim that they are bothered not so much by their son-in-law’s dalit origins, as his marital status (the young man is a divorcee). Casteism gets ‘secularised’ when you are able to conceal your casteist fears by offering another (false) fear in its place which appears more ‘acceptable’ (another example: ‘oh, it is ok that they are dalit; just that they aren’t clean enough’). Secondly, hypocrisy has been endemic within the Kerala Left circles since many decades now. The door to hypocrisy was opened early: EMS Namboodiripad, for example, argued after the restrictions on the communist party had lifted, that communists should not try to devote much effort to create their own (more equitable) norms of community life; instead, they must marry and settle down as ‘normal’ householders, so that their influence in social and community institutions may increase. It is not difficult to see that such strategic participation held the possibility of degenerating into the normalization of plain hypocrisy. It is not news that we have no socialist Left now, but a neoliberal party for which leftism is a talisman of sorts. The moral community of the Left which early communists sought is non-existent; instead, the Left parties are a collection of different types of self-seeking agents offering ‘services’ to prop up the edifice – muscle power, social-media-lung-power, deployable bodies, or intellectual posturing. In other words, the community of the Left is as degenerate as any other twentieth-century caste/community formation in Kerala. Remember Hadiya Ashokan, alleged ‘love jihad’ victim, locked up at home for months? Remember those young people in the Hindutva torture camp in Tripunithura whose parents had betrayed them? The many recent cases of confinement and torture of LGBTQI young people by their families? Anupama’s experience is a continuation of these. Have no illusions about the CPM, please.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/what-is-left-now-only-respectability/articleshow/87230831.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Strict laws shut down offerings of alcohol||AHMEDABAD: It may seem disrespectful to visit a place of worship with bottles of liquor, but not at these temples. Though a dry state since it was formed in 1960, there are a handful of temples in Gujarat – two of them in our very own city – where liquor is actually an offering of faith. However, with the passage of time and stricter liquor laws, the flow of liquor has dribbled into nothingness at most of these places. Located in Maninagar area is the famous Bhairavnath temple. For years, devotees brought liquor to the temple as an offering. “However, this practice was stopped in 2008 after locals alleged that some anti-social elements who began selling liquor around the temple,” said Harshad Patel, a resident of the area. Meanwhile, liquor was still being offered at the temple of Goddess Masani Meldi Ma in Naroda till 2018 when the state government introduced stricter prohibition laws. The caretakers of the temple, which is located inside a crematorium, said, “People believed that anyone who offered alcohol at the temple would get rid of his/her addiction to liquor. After the government tightened liquor laws, we had to put up a board to stop people from offering alcohol.” Similarly, Bhathiji Maharaj temple in Davda village of Nadiad taluka in Kheda also stopped offerings of liquor two decades ago. Sarpanch Vimla Parmar of Davda said, “People believed that if they offered liquor, their near and dear ones who are alcoholics would quit drinking. This was never endorsed by the temple authorities, but devotees continued to flock this place. Finally, in 2004, we began stopping people from offering liquor here.” Devotees also offered the choicest brands of foreign liquor to seek blessings at Kaal Bhairav temple in Bhuj, Kutch. The temple was built in 2014, along the lines of the Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain, MP. However, people gradually stopped this practice after the intervention of local police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/strict-laws-shut-down-offerings-of-alcohol/articleshow/87230796.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Lucknow||Herd immunity has tamed Covid: Docs||Lucknow: The negligible Covid-19 cases in Lucknow over the past 100 days indicate that herd immunity is developing in the population against novel coronavirus due to high exposure during the second wave. This is the view of experts after analysing the transmission rate in the city since July. Herd immunity develops in a population when 80% of the people are exposed to a virus. The ICMR serological survey has found antibodies against Covid in 71% of UP’s population, which indicates that a large section was exposed to coronavirus in the second wave, say experts. This, experts predicted, has reduced the possibility of a third wave, and in case it comes, the intensity would be lower in comparison to earlier two spikes. However, if there is a mutation in the virus, a third wave could be devastating. In such a scenario, people should not let their guard down and get vaccinated at the earliest, which will play a supportive role in maintaining herd immunity for long, eventually reducing the pandemic to an endemic, add experts. “The development of herd immunity explains why cases have remained so low for such a long period. Lucknow has also done well on the vaccination front, which has made things more favourable,” said Prof Amita Jain, head of microbiology at KGMU. “Research has concluded that herd immunity against Covid-19 develops when 80% of the population of a region has antibodies against it,” said Dr Rahul Gam, consultant at National Health Authority. “The ICMR serological survey done in July found presence of antibodies in 71% of UP’s population,” he added. “The few cases at present indicate that the virus is circulating but is not finding an adequate host to multiply itself because antibodies—formed either due to natural infection or vaccination—are neutralising it within the 4-5 days of incubation period,” said Dr Gam. “As a result, people with antibodies are not falling ill or getting infected even after coming in contact with the virus. Besides, since the immune system is not allowing the virus to multiply, people are not passing it to others,” he said. However, this does not mean that the threat is gone. “The virus after entering a vaccinated person can mutate to evade antibodies. A person infected with the mutated variant can spread it to others. This variant becomes stronger with further circulation in the population,” warned Prof AK Gulati, ex-director of microbiology department at BHU-Institute of Medical Sciences. “If the current transmission continues, there would be no third wave or a very weak one, but in case there is a mutation, the new variant can play havoc,” he added. Experts also pointed out how the delta variant caused a surge in the US, UK and other European countries despite having a better vaccination record. Epidemiologist Dr Amit Singh said the only way to prevent mutation is to strictly adhere to Covid protocols.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/herd-immunity-has-tamed-covid-docs/articleshow/87231286.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

With the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, the state government had prohibited physical meetings in all local bodies including in Nagpur Municipal Corporation and made virtual meetings mandatory. During the last 21 months of Covid-induced restrictions, the NMC in June 2020 had obtained permission to hold the general body meeting physically which went on for five days. Later, the government continued with the restrictions on holding physical meetings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/udd-allows-physical-meetings-in-corporations-and-councils/articleshow/87230210.cms||---

Earlier, Owaisi met the family of the deceased councillor, who was murdered in broad daylight on August 28. Kithore is a minority-dominated constituency. It was earlier represented by veteran Samajwadi Party leader and former cabinet minister Shahid Manzoor, who lost to BJP nominee in the 2017 assembly election. Training his guns at the SP, Owaisi appealed to the members of Muslim community not to vote for SP. He said, “ SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has lost three elections. Don't vote for SP now. Actually, voting for SP and even BSP will not bring any revolution.” Referring to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, Owaisi said if someone dies, she goes there and wondered why she did not seek justice for Faisal Hussain of Unnao who died in police custody. The 18-year-old vegetable-seller was allegedly thrashed by policemen and died in police custody in May. The AIMIM chief also expressed his grief for those who were killed in the violence during the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests. Seeking justice for Maulana Kalim Siddiqui, who had been sent to jail in the case of conversion, Owaisi alleged, “They sent the Maulana to jail in a fake case.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/no-one-remembers-muslims-after-elections-says-owaisi/articleshow/87230207.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Dhariawad awaits development while youths seek tribal reservation||DHARIAWAD: Even an outsider can tell Dhariawad hasn’t changed a bit in the past more than a decade. Its roads are still broken, its houses and markets bear no mark of modernisation and people attired in rural outfits drudge around leisurely, failing to see any exciting future. “I have come here after nearly 12 years but there appears no change in this town,” says Rajesh Kumar, a Gujarat-based marketing guy, as he sips tea near a hand-pulled cart at Dhariawad old bus stand. Thavarchand Damor, who works at a nearby onion wholesale trading shop, concurs. “Different party governments have been formed and fallen but Dhariawad has seen no development. We still lack teaching staff at college, doctors at the health centre and even a Nagar Palika to look after the town’s sanitation,” he says, while laughing at the promises made by politicians. A part of the problem could be because of bureaucratic apathy. Created in 2008, Dhariawad is probably Rajasthan’s only assembly constituency that is spread across two districts, Pratapgarh and Udaipur, hence governed by two collectors and two superintendents of police. Locals point out the missing administrative coordination and politicians say it's tough to deal with “too many” bureaucrats. The constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribe candidates is once again witnessing elections as sitting legislator Gautam Lal Meena’s demise due to covid last year has necessitated the bypoll, which is scheduled on October 30. Seven candidates are in the fray, but the fight is mainly between ex-MLA Nagraj Meena of Congress, Khet Singh Meena of BJP, Ganesh Lal Meena of Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) and Thawarchand Damor, a BTP rebel. BTP, a relevantly new party, has made it tough for Congress and BJP by attracting the rural youth on tribal reservation matter as unemployment remains the main election plank here. The constituency criss-crossed by hilly terrain and forests has 80-82% tribal population, yet the non-tribal, which are barely 20%, enjoy 50% quota in government jobs. “Since 2013 we have been fighting for 100% tribal quota in Tribal Sub-Plan areas as envisaged in Constitution’s Schedule V, but successive Congress-BJP governments have ignored us,” says BTP MLA Rajkumar Roat. Businesses are controlled by non-tribal residents in the constituency. Hundreds of tribal men and women routinely gather outside Dhariawad cooperative society building to be hired as daily wage labourers in agriculture farms. During non-agriculture seasons they either work as construction labourers or migrate to nearby Gujarat in search of livelihood. Maybe that’s why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a favourite despite the rising inflation in the remote area. BTP may affect rural youth but Congress and BJP have deep roots in Dhariawad, which comprises three panchayat samiti areas—Dhariawad, Lasadia and Jhallara. BJP has a strong foothold in Lasadia, which was home to late MLA Gautam Lal Meena, while Congress has an upper hand in Lasadia. Dhariawad, which has the constituency's maximum voters, has become unpredictable since it is home to Congress, BJP and BTP candidates. Tribal votes appear divided because of BTP and its rebel, bringing into prominence the non-tribal voters for whom BJP has roped in deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore and Congress is banking on former seed corporation chairman Dharmendra Rathore to clinch the tribal seat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/udaipur/dhariawad-awaits-development-while-tribal-youth-seek-tsp-quota/articleshow/87236443.cms||Bhanupratap Singh
---||Mumbai||Judge isn’t biased, says court order rejecting Kangana Ranaut’s plea||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting a plea made by actor Kangana Ranaut for transfer of veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar’s defamation complaint against her to another court, the Esplanade court has held that if the matter is transferred on the basis of false allegation, it will affect the morale of the magistrate. Citing bias, Ranaut had earlier said that she had lost faith in the Andheri metropolitan magistrate court that is hearing the defamation case. “Unless some positive, concrete case is made out showing that there is reasonable apprehension of not getting fair trial or fair justice from the concerned court, the proceeding cannot be transferred from one court to another on mere vague and general allegations,” additional chief metropolitan magistrate ST Dande said. While the court had rejected Ranaut’s plea on October 21, the detailed seven-page order copy was made available on Friday. The court further said that merely because the magistrate proceeded with the case by following the procedure of law, it did not mean that he is biased against Ranaut. “It is settled position of law that the proceeding cannot be transferred from one court to another on mere apprehension. The applicant (Ranaut) has failed to make out positive, concrete case to show that her apprehension is reasonable,” the court said. During arguments, Ranaut’s lawyer had submitted that the magistrate intentionally caused injury to her mind and reputation by announcing in an open court on two different occasions before the media that “if the applicant is not present for hearing on the next date, an arrest warrant will be issued against her”. However, the additional chief metropolitan magistrate pointed to court records which showed that the concerned court had never rejected any exemption application filed by Ranaut. “However, he has rejected several applications of complainant (Akhtar) filed for issuance of non-bailable warrant against the accused. It shows that the metropolitan magistrate, Andheri, Mumbai, has given fair opportunity to the accused to remain absent by granting all her exemption applications,” the court said. It also said that “...Metropolitan Magistrate, Andheri, has acted judiciously and is not biased against the applicant.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-judge-isnt-biased-says-court-order-rejecting-kanganas-plea/articleshow/87231936.cms||Rebecca Samervel

It’s the second highest number of people to be vaccinated in a day during the mass inoculation drive in the district. Earlier, the district had vaccinated 1, 51, 685 people in the first mega drive that was organized on September 12.A health department official the drive was organized on Saturday to encourage tipplers to take the jab. “Many people, who consume liquor on Sundays, were not coming forward to get inoculated.”It is to be noted that the district had hosted five mega vaccination drives in the past and they were all held on Sundays.Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran said 1, 17, 799 vaccine doses were administered on the day and 76.7% of the beneficiaries were the people who were due for the second dose.At least 1,372 vaccination camps were organized in the district as part of the mega drive and 269 of them were in the city corporation limits. A corporation official said more than 40,000 people had benefitted from the drive on the day.A city health official said the turnout was poor after 4pm and they had utilized the remaining vaccine doses in each camp to inoculate people at their doorsteps. “It was elderly people who mostly benefited from the doorstep vaccination arrangement.” Electricity minister V Senthil Balaji, who was in the city, visited the vaccination centres at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, VOC Park and YWCA Matriculation Higher Secondary School. He was accompanied by district collector and corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara.Talking to the media, the minister said the mega vaccination drives were held in the district in the best possible manner so far.

Now 30 and a mother of three with two daughters herself, she added, “My mother is serving such a harsh punishment for a crime that she did not commit. I cannot bear this pain." Several lawyers are now willing to take up her case pro bono. Sunil Chaudhary, an advocate in Allahabad high court, showed interest so that the "family gets justice". Bheesham Singh of 'Pari', an NGO that advocates against sexual violence, has also met the family. The mother, Kasturi Devi, was handed the sentence by Bulandshahr’s additional sessions court’s judge Rajeshwar Shukla, who in his order observed, "The woman didn’t have to hit the deceased so many times with an axe to stop the rape bid as even small force could have been deployed." It concluded that the act was “honour killing” and a “planned murder.” The judgment was delivered a day before Dussehra. TOI had reported the matter on October 18. Commenting on her mother's sentence, the woman said she is also a mother now and she would do the same if someone tries to rape her daughters. “The court order states that in the investigation, it was found that I had a relationship with the deceased (Praveen Kumar). This is totally untrue. I had never seen him prior to that night,” she said. The woman, given her impoverished condition, could not attend school and was married at a young age. Her two-room house barely has plaster on the walls - no luxury amenities, only an old radio set placed in a corner. Her younger brother, who, too, was an eyewitness to the incident, said that his father died of illness in 2003 and his mother had laboured in the farms alone to raise her four children. “Now, it's our turn to repay what our mother did for us,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/wont-be-able-to-sleep-until-i-get-my-mother-out-of-jail/articleshow/87230215.cms||Ishita Mishra

Zoho will lead the consortium with the partnership of local industries that will have equal investment, he said. “The purpose is to do deep R&D by working with all major industries in the region. I will head this new company,” Sridhar said. “I was visiting industries in Karur, Tirupur, Erode and Coimbatore for the last three days to find the challenges they face and their requirements.” The cost of labour has been high in the region and shortage of labour has been pushing industries to automation, Sridhar said. “Most of the machinery used by textile and other industries are imported due to lack of domestic R&D. This has been adding up to the cost of machinery.” While Zoho has experience in R&D, it will offer leadership and capital for the R&D company - which was conceptualised during the discussion with industries, the business magnate said. “Kongu region is richer in terms of industries compared to regions in northern states like Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. We need automation to compete with countries like Bangladesh.

He said the unit at Seeranaickenpalayam alone could not meet the rising number of complaints from the city residents.The officer said the Ondipudur unit, the constriction of which had begun in 2019 at a cost of Rs 36 lakh, was ready last year. “However, it took time for us to finalize an NGO to run the birth control activities. And we were concentrating fully on Covid-19 pandemic last year,” he said when asked about the delay in opening the centre that is spread across 4,700sqft space.He said around 30 to 40 stray dogs were caught in a day for the birth control activities. While the centre at Seeranaickenpalayam is taken care of by the Human Animal Society and caters to the wards in north and west zones of the corporation, animal birth control activities at the Ondipudur unit, which is dedicated to the remaining three corporation zones, is handled by the NGO Pranimithran.Another health official with the city corporation said all the rules and regulations related to handling dogs while catching and releasing them were strictly followed. “There are more than 40,000 stray dogs in the city. We, however, don’t have any data to show the exact numbers. Only a miniscule number of them is sterilized. We have displayed the numbers to be contacted for stray dog related complaints in all zonal and ward offices,” the official said. He said the city corporation had to shut down the animal birth control unit at Ukkadam in March 2017 after the residents complained that the dogs were entering their locality by jumping off compound walls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/animal-birth-control-unit-at-ondipudur-operational-now/articleshow/87230808.cms||---

She added that use of these products would motivate other women to make such products for sale, thereby supplementing their income. Chairman, Gau Seva Ayog, Haryana, Shrawan Kumar Garg said training camps would be organised to help hone skills of women in rural areas. During the training camp held on October 21, 37 women throughout Haryana participated in the event and introduced a range of products made of cow dung and gau mutra.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Railway cops use social media honeytrap to nab phone thief||MUMBAI: A 17-year-old boy from Vasai who had fled to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh after stealing a mobile phone from a train commuter was honey-trapped by the railway police and detained recently. The boy, whose identity has been withheld as he is a minor, has four other cases of theft registered against him in the past. The latest instance was reported on August 4 in the Pune-Jaipur Express. A commuter, Rajkumar Meena, was occupying a window seat. While he was checking his phone and the train had started moving from Vasai station, someone slid his hand under the window and snatched the handset. Meena registered a complaint with Vasai Government Railway Police (GRP). Police tracked the stolen phone with its IMEI number and traced its location to a youngster living in Vasai (East). The 17-year-old told the police that he had borrowed the phone from his friend, who was the same age as him, since his handset was damaged. The police then started looking for his friend but learnt that he had slipped out of town. “We gathered that the phone was stolen by his friend. But we did not know where he was hiding,” said a Vasai GRP officer. The police then found out that the accused had an account on Instagram. One of the GRP constables created a fake Instagram account in a woman’s name and uploaded a random display picture of a woman that he got off the internet. The constable sent the accused several direct messages. He responded and the two began to chat frequently. Once they grew close, the constable — who was posing as a woman — inquired where the boy was put up. The accused replied that he was in Uttar Pradesh. “The constable called him to a garden in Nalasopara for a date. When the accused turned up on October 22, we detained him,” said an officer. As the boy is underage, he has been sent to an observation home in Bhiwandi. The accused started his criminal career in 2019. The first case of theft was registered in 2019 and three more cases were registered earlier this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-cops-use-social-media-honeytrap-to-nab-phone-thief/articleshow/87231937.cms||Nitasha Natu

On Saturday, the OBC Manch members gave an online representation to chief minister Ashok Gehlot stating that they should be given reservations according to their population share. “We have been demanding that our share has to increase in the state from 21% at present and separate reservation scheme should be introduced in TSP areas which will ensure the justice to us,” said Naresh Patel, coordinator of Manch based in Banswara. The body accused political parties of ignoring OBCs in the poll-bound assembly segments—Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad. “The OBCs are sizeable in both the segments and just one OBC candidate is contesting from the open category seat Vallabhnagar even after the community which has been given the chance to contest by both the major parties have fewer votes than us,” said Patel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/obc-in-tribal-areas-demands-reservation/articleshow/87230815.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Connecting with ‘Common Man’s creator||R K Laxman’s birth centenary Sometimes I wonder if R K Laxman, the iconic cartoonist, was living in Chandigarh, what themes would he pick up for his legendary ‘Common Man’ cartoons? Would he have lampooned our netas promising the magical ‘Metro’ for decades to solve city’s traffic woes, without anything moving by an inch on the ground. Or would he have depicted the petrified common man, valiantly shooing away a pack of street dogs, attacking him on his morning walk, with his ubiquitous umbrella? Or would it be city mayor offering free boat rides to all motorists stranded on Madhya Marg during the torrential monsoon? Surely, there would be no dearth of inspirations for him to have mined from the ‘City Beautiful’. Interestingly, both the city’s iconic architect-planner, Le Corbusier, and R K Laxman, had a great fascination for sketching crows! In fact, Corbusier (original name Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris) took on moniker from the common bird, meaning ‘crow-like’. Laxman too had a deep fascination for the lowly, common bird not envied for beauty – and sketched many of them seen perched on his window sill every day. Laxman’s symbol, the Common Man – just like the fictional town of Malgudi of his equally, legendary elder brother R K Narayan—is everywhere yet ‘no where’ in real life, both epitomising universal, human condition and situations, with strokes of genius. My first brush with the iconic brothers was decades ago, when our otherwise rather stern father, would be chuckling with delight to himself, reading Narayan’s novels serialised in a popular magazine then, with telling illustrations by Laxman. Later growing up as an ardent admirer of the duo— I would never miss starting my day without savouring Laxman’s pocket cartoon in The Times of India, ‘You said it’ depicting a “man in black checked coat, whose bald head boasts only a wisp of white hair. He has a permanent look of bewilderment on his face. He is ubiquitous.” Whether it was a new book by Narayan, with Laxman providing authentic visual imagery to Malgudi and its depiction as the quintessential South Indian small town or his caricatures of Indian politicians and the silently suffering jantaa they said it all. But ‘stinging without wounding’ or drawing bad blood ever. In 1998, Laxman turned writerly and penned his autobiography Through the Tunnel of Time’. Curious, that how a self-taught, formally untrained artist like him could become the master of pen and brush stroke, I read it in one greedy gulp. Moved by his amazing resolve to become a cartoonist, notwithstanding all obstacles — I wrote him a ‘fan-mail’ complimenting him on book. I soon got a very fond reply thanking me for my appreciation, enclosed with one of his recent cartoons duly autographed for me. I now had with me a letter with his hallmark signatures — the famous scrawny long flourish, adorning his cartoons everyday –as a prized possession! In 2001 when R K Narayan was awarded the Padma Vibushan, I published a spoof in the form of an open letter from the residents of his fictional town Malgudi, beseeching him to be the chief guest at the town hall function to honour him, imitating his style of narration and his Malgudi characters. One evening when I returned from work, our semi-literate cook in his usual laconic manner mentioned that there had been a phone call from one ‘Laaks..man Sahib’ from Bombay for me. It was a quizzical, as he could not recall the name accurately, but had noted down a phone number to call him back. The next day I eagerly dialled the number with bated breath. Finally, a gruff ‘Yes’ was heard, and I rattled off my well-rehearsed lines, only to be responded only with great warmth, mentioning that he had liked my Middle piece on Narayan in the TOI very much, and had got my address especially from the Delhi office to convey his compliments. In fact, he had also sent a copy of the article to Narayan in Chennai too, obtained his autograph and sent it to me. As I poured out my gushing admiration for his work, he patiently kept chatting with me for nearly half an hour and even invited me to visit him in Mumbai/Pune where he now lived. The creator of the 'Common Man' may have left the front pages of the newspaper-- I suspect up there in his heavenly abode, he is bringing about a chuckle to the gods and goddesses with his gentle, irreverent spoofs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/connecting-with-common-mans-creator/articleshow/87230224.cms||Rajnish Wattas
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rape accused acquitted as no proof of arrest||MUMBAI: With police failing to prove that a 31-year-old cabin crew working with a domestic airline was even arrested in a rape case, a magistrate court recently acquitted him in a second case where he was booked for fleeing from police custody on the day he was arrested. Police claimed he fled from Nagpada police hospital in 2013 after undergoing a medical examination, part of the mandatory procedure. The court said if the accused was arrested, police must have know his address, from where he could have been rearrested. “If accused really wants to escape, there was no reason for him to come towards Borivli police station (the following day). When he is disputing his arrest, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that he was legally apprehended,” the court said. It said no evidence was brought on record. “The prosecution failed to prove guilt of accused beyond reasonable doubt…” the court said. In 2016, he was discharged in the rape case as the sessions court found that he married the woman. The woman had accused him of having sex with her with the promise that he would marry her. She filed a complaint when he went back on his word. In the second case, he was booked under Indian Penal Code section 224 relating to resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful aprehension. The charge attracts a maximum sentence of two years. Acquitting the man, Mazgaon magistrate’s court said the investigating officer had no explanation for not collecting the medical papers and failing to draw the spot panchanama. The incident allegedly took place on December 20, 2013. Two cops had allegedly accompanied the accused. The prosecution alleged that after a medical examination, when a cop was handcuffing the accused and the other was hailing a cab to go back to Borivli police station, he fled. Six cops deposed during the trial. The court said it had not come in the evidence of the investigating officer as to who was the officer who arrested the accused in the case. It said the FIR mentioned the accused ran towards JJ bridge. It said the place was crowded and he could have been easily arrested. However, no independent witness of the incident was found.

Confirming this, senior superintendent of Agra central jail, VK Singh, said that the 38 prisoners — 27 from the Valley and 11 from Jammu -- were transferred to the jail amid tight security. Besides, 18 prisoners from J&K are already lodged in the jail under the PSA Act. Two days ago, the Jammu and Kashmir home department had issued orders mentioning its decision to move several PSA detainees from their jails to the central jail in Agra. These inmates were earlier lodged in Baramulla, Srinagar, Kupwara, Kot Bhalwal in Jammu, Rajouri and Poonch. The detainees had allegedly carried out terror conspiracies from inside the prison premises in the Valley. In 2019, terrorists and OGWs from jvarious jails in J&K were also moved to UP, post the nullification of Article 370.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/38-prisoners-from-jk-shifted-to-agra-central-jail/articleshow/87230221.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

BJP failed to deliver and is preparing for a historic defeat, he said. “Harte hue logon ko har pal harane wale yaad aate hain … 22 mein BJP ki aitihasik haar hogi (Those on the verge of defeat always talk about those who are defeating them … BJP will face a historic defeat in 2022),” Akhilesh tweeted on Saturday morning. Later, addressing party workers at the party headquarters, the SP president accused BJP of deviating from the present because the government has nothing to showcase as an its achievement. He said BJP can only spread hate to divide the society. They (BJP) promised to double the income of farmers on page number one of their Sankalp Patra. They promised 70 lakh jobs for youths. But BJP will not talk about all this because they know they have not delivered, he said. “BJP has misled people and not hesitated in taking them for a ride. They promised to double the income of farmers and ensure that their produce is procured at Minimum Support Price (MSP) but have failed to ensure both. They failed to create jobs for the unemployed and the condition of the health sector has deteriorated during the four and a half years of the BJP regime,” Akhilesh said. At the infra-structure front, the government remained in a state of policy paralysis for four and a half years and are now out to sell off the national assets. After banks, insurance and railways, the BJP is now selling off airports only to benefit the capitalists because the ruling BJP is more concerned about the interests of the handful of corporates than crores of the poor, the SP national president said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-should-be-prepared-for-its-historic-defeat-akhilesh/articleshow/87231318.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Agra||Agra SSP moved 3 days after Dalit man’s death in 'custody'||Agra: Three days after the alleged custodial death of a Dalit sanitation worker, Arun Valmiki, Agra’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G was transferred to the state election cell in Lucknow on Saturday. Valmiki, who was accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from city’s police station ‘malkhana’, allegedly died after police interrogation. Muniraj was replaced by Azamgarh superintendent of police Sudhir Kumar Singh barely seven months after he took charge of Agra. Besides Muniraj, 13 more IPS officers were also transferred on Saturday. After Valmiki’s death on Tuesday night, five policemen, including the police chowki in-charge and an inspector of the crime branch, were suspended and an FIR was lodged against “unidentified cops” under IPC section 302 (murder). Earlier, after the theft was first reported, six policemen had been suspended for “negligence”. Family members alleged Valmiki’s death was due to “torture” by police personnel during interrogation though the post-mortem report revealed the cause of death to be "heart attack". The case triggered a political row with opposition hitting out at the BJP-led government in the state and demanding justice for the family. The UP police also transferred the investigation of the case to Aligarh range police "to maintain transparency in the probe".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-ssp-moved-3-days-after-dalit-mans-death-in-custody/articleshow/87230235.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

He also accused the BJP government of asking central probe agencies to target people whenever there is an election around to "create a panic". Gehlot was speaking to reporters at the SMS Hospital, where he had gone to visit Dr S N Subba Rao, who is admitted there. "Ever since they have won the elections, they have started a new tradition, which is unfortunate. Then there is a fear among people and an atmosphere of suffocation has been created. Modi should remove this atmosphere," Gehlot told reporters without naming the BJP. He also alleged whenever there is an election approaching "a message is sent to officials of the CBI, Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate that now you have to choose and send out a message so that people panic". "This is their agenda. This is their tactic," he said. He also said there will be love, brotherhood and trust in the government only when there is good governance. "I believe the Centre is failing in this. Since Modi is the prime minister, his biggest responsibility is to monitor and see what the reality is and make decisions based on that reality. Only then he will be able to deliver good governance," the senior Congress leader said" Otherwise, people will teach them a lesson and "they will not even know", he said. "This has happened many times in the past whether with the Congress or the BJP.” "Even when Vajpayee ji was there... a great leader like Indira Gandhi lost the election. So the public does not spare anyone. The people of the country are very intelligent. They may be illiterate or less educated, but the people of India have no match in the world when it comes to intelligence." Gehlot also targeted the Centre over rising inflation, unemployment, and farmers' agitation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/atmosphere-of-suffocation-created-in-country-pm-should-work-to-remove-it-ashok-gehlot/articleshow/87230836.cms||---
---||Goa||India cannot rely on Sunil Chhetri alone, youngsters must deliver: Bhutia||Panaji: Former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia believes it is time for the youngsters in the Indian football team to show maturity and deliver on the big stages. India recently won their eight SAFF Championship in Maldives. Igor Stimac’s side remained unbeaten in the tournament, but their performances, particularly in the first two games against Bangladesh (1-1) and Sri Lanka (0-0) – both much lower-ranked teams – left a lot to be desired. “I think the Indian team is going through a challenge of its own,” Bhutia told TOI during the launch of Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools (BBFF) here on Sunday. “Right now, sadly, the fact is we are only relying on Sunil (Chhetri) to deliver results and goals, which is not good. Sunil has been an outstanding player, but as a team, we need to improve a lot.” Chhetri finished as the highest goal-scorer at the SAFF Championship, delivering when it mattered the most. It was his lone goal in the must-win game against Nepal that kept India alive in the competition. Chhetri also inspired the team against hosts Maldives in the decisive group clash, and then in the final against Nepal, which India won comfortably 3-0. The India captain is now tied fifth with Argentina and PSG star Lionel Messi on 80 goals in the list of active international goal scorers. However, at 37, Chhetri alone cannot shoulder the burden. “Right now, we are not getting to see a young player making a big impact, which is very unfortunate. When we were playing during our time, there was quality all across. As a team, we need to see the quality all across, not just Sunil.

---||Chandigarh||BJP, Congress, AAP scout for women candidates ahead of Chandigarh MC polls||CHANDIGARH: As the State Election Commission, UT, Chandigarh, has reserved 12 out of 35 MC wards for woman candidates (three for SC category), BJP, Congress and AAP are faced with a dearth of popular woman leaders who could be fielded for elections scheduled to be held in the third week of December. Among all the three parties, BJP is better placed in terms of women candidates. Popular woman faces in the BJP include sitting councillors Raj Bala Malik (former mayor), Asha Jaiswal (former mayor), Heera Negi (former senior deputy mayor), Farmila (deputy mayor) and Sunita Dhawan besides Poonam Sharma (former mayor). From woman reserved ward, BJP can also give ticket to nominated councillor Shipra Bansal, who is active in social activities and is also a committed party worker. Since sitting councillor Jagtar Jagga’s ward was reserved for women, the party could also field his wife from Manimajra. Woman candidates the Congress could field are sitting councillors Gurbax Rawat (former deputy mayor), Sheela Devi (former deputy mayor), Ravinder Kaur Gujral, besides other female leaders including Kamlesh (former mayor), Deipa Asdhir Dubey (Congress woman wing president), Balwinder Rana Kaur and Meenakshi Chaudhary. The party also plans to field leader of opposition Devinder Babla’s wife Harpreet Kaur Babla, a former councillor, from ward 10, which was reserved for women. In AAP, Anita Sharma, who is heading the party’s woman wing and Kamlesh Chaudhary are among key contenders. AAP has its pick of active women workers for the Chandigarh MC elections, which the party plans to contest on all 35 wards. Interestingly, most of these popular faces do not belong to the 12 wards that have been reserved for women. Party leaders have already started recommending names of female members of their families. In the draw of lots, which was held in the presence of representatives of political parties at UT Guest House on October 19, wards 7, 16, 19, 24, 26, 28 and 31 were reserved for SC candidates. Out of the seven wards, wards 16, 19 and 28 were reserved for SC woman candidates. Out of 35 wards, wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 22 and 23 were reserved for women (general) candidates. In comparison to last MC polls in 2016, the number of wards this time has increased from 26 to 35. Box: Local candidates preferred While BJP, Congress and AAP plan to field big names whose wards have been reserved from other wards, people are demanding local candidates from their respective wards, irrespective of their gender.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-cong-aap-scout-for-women-candidates-ahead-of-mc-polls/articleshow/87230242.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Agra||Super conductor: Bus man links up with school, cops, sends truant Meerut girl home||AGRA: A UP bus conductor is being hailed as a hero for ensuring safe return home of an Army personnel’s 12-year-old daughter, who went missing from her home in Meerut on Friday. The girl had told her family that she was going to school but when she didn’t return after school ended around 12 noon, her family members started searching for her and eventually filed a complaint with police late afternoon. Meanwhile, the girl, it was later found, had reached Aligarh. Around 6.30 pm, she boarded a bus bound for Agra. The conductor of the bus, Dinesh Singh, found the girl’s movements suspicious and questioned her. “I found it a little strange that a young girl was travelling all alone. I asked her about her parents’ names and address but she didn’t respond. When I queried about her fare, she claimed that her uncle had already paid me, which was not true.” Singh said that he then requested one of the women passengers to check the girl’s bag. The search revealed a school uniform and a belt with a school logo printed on it. “I realised that the girl has run away from school. I was able to identify the school, too, as my brother’s daughter studies there.” Singh contacted his brother, who helped circulate the girl’s photo on the school’s WhatsApp group to confirm her identity. “Within some time, I received a call from an IPS officer from Meerut, and thereafter from the Agra and Hathras SPs, who co-ordinated with me regarding the girl’s return,” Singh said. The girl was handed over to cops at Baros toll plaza under Sadabad police jurisdiction of Hathras late on Friday. Hathras SP Vineet Jaiswal, who coordinated the girl’s return to Meerut from Hathras, told TOI that he had received information from Army officers in Meerut about the missing girl.“An FIR was lodged by the girl’s father at Lal Kurti police station in Meerut under section 363 (kidnapping) of IPC. The girl was later safely handed over to her family.” A search of the girl’s bag subsequently revealed a paper with a map charting out the route she planned to take -- from Meerut to Ghaziabad-Gautam Budh Nagar-Agra and then onwards to Maharashtra’s Kolhapur. A bus ticket from Bulandshahr to Aligarh was also found in her bag. When contacted, the girl’s father, who hails from Maharashtra, said that he was extremely thankful to the bus conductor. “If he had not acted on time, anything could have happened.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/super-conductor-bus-man-links-up-with-school-cops-sends-truant-girl-home/articleshow/87230258.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Sejpal, who had been absconding for two years, was arrested from Junagadh and produced before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate in Junagadh. The court has approved the request for a custodial interrogation for three days, confirmed SGST officials. All the 11 firms investigated in April 2019 at various location by SGST officials, were found to be shell companies which existed only on paper. Upon further probe, it was found that these firms were floated by father-son duo Dilip and Mitesh Sejpal and were involved in fake billing transactions to the tune of Rs 235 crore which amounted to an evasion worth Rs 11.17 crore. The amount of evasion discovered is expected to increase as further probe continues in the case. A lot of incriminating documents including laptops, mobile phones and cheque books of various bogus firms and incriminating documents were found, which have been seized.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/absconder-held-after-2-years-in-rs-235cr-fake-billing-scam/articleshow/87230840.cms||---

While the Thane district has the highest number of such unvaccinated people (15.3 lakh), Nashik district is close behind (14.1 lakh), followed by Aurangabad district (10.8 lakh). The state government’s ‘Mission Yuva Swasthya’, a joint immunisation drive planned by the public health department and the higher and technical education department from October 25 to November 2, aims to cover a chunk of these beneficiaries. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid-19 taskforce, said the reasons for more than two crore adults in the state being unvaccinated could be many. “Compared to the urban youth, many rural youngsters don’t have easy access to vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy has also been observed among sections of the 18-44 group. Covid infection in the past and the related delay is also responsible,” he said. While institutes of higher learning across the state have already started offline classes from October 20, experts have raised concerns over the vulnerability of the 18-44 group. “This age group is very active and highly mobile. If they are protected, it could lower chances of possible transmission of the disease,” Pandit said. As part of Mission Yuva Swasthya, special vaccination sessions are being planned in colleges for students, teachers and the support staff. While the daily progress of the drive will be recorded on CoWIN portal as well as on Google Sheets, the best-performing college, district, and region will be recognized by the government at the end of the drive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/over-2cr-beneficiaries-aged-18-44-yrs-yet-to-get-1st-jab/articleshow/87228961.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Lucknow||Ram temple trust accounts to be managed by TCS||AYODHYA: After Ram temple trust faced allegations of corruption over land deals, the management of Ram Temple Trust funds that have crossed Rs 3,000crore, has been entrusted to corporate giant, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is developing a digital accounting software. Ram temple Trust general secretary Champat Rai has confirmed the takeover. Top sources told TOI that RSS, which had summoned three key Trust members to Mumbai four months ago for a closed-door meeting over the controversial land deals, initiated handover of accounts to a professional firm. TCS has set up its accounts office at Ramghat near Ramjanmabhoomi and is scheduled to complete developing the software by December and begin digitisation and management of Trust accounts. IT experts from the Tata Group recently gave a power-point presentation of the software to temple construction committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra. Temple Trust secretary Champat Rai said in a press statement that TCS’s digital performance is good. “We discussed our requirements with their software experts, who are now installing an accounting system. TCS will digitise and manage our accounts from December,” he said. When Trust coffers began to swell at the peak of the VHP crowdfunding campaign for Ram temple construction, conmen hacked into the Trust website and created a fake portal to siphon off funds. Fraudsters also cloned cheques of Temple Trust's bank account and withdrew big money after the PSU bank's clearing house repeatedly failed to connect to the Trust secretary for a final nod before the debit. After botched funds management, the Trust got embroiled in court cases over allegations of corruption in land deals, including purchase of nazul land and temples. Talking to TOI, temple trust member Anil Mishra, said, “Digitization of accounts of Ram Temple Trust will be handled by TCS. Our team of chartered accountants will continue to maintain accounts of income and expenses."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ram-temple-trust-ac/s-to-be-managed-by-tcs/articleshow/87231332.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Gandhi Nagar police here have charged cases against seven AISF members based on a complaint filed by SFI. Meanwhile, AISF leaders said that SFI had given the complaint to defend itself against the case filed by AISF earlier. Based on a complaint by Nimisha Raju, AISF state joint secretary, police had charged cases against 10 SFI members on Friday. AISF leadership said that the visuals of the incident make it clear as to what had happened that day. SFI filed the complaint a day after the incident. AISF leaders suspect that attempts are being made to sabotage the case. They made it clear that they would take action if it was proved that any of their members had hit SFI members. They asked why the police are not taking any action against the culprits even after videos of Sahad being beaten up have appeared. They challenged the SFI leadership to take action against those who indulged in the violence. Meanwhile, Kottayam DSP has taken over the investigation of the case related to the charges under Atrocities Act filed by both parties. SFI slams misinformation campaign Meanwhile, SFI state secretary KM Sachin Dev said on Saturday that students should reject the misinformation campaign by AISF who are making baseless allegation against SFI leaders.  “The actions from the side of AISF who joined the right-wing camp and campaigned against SFI, was deplorable right from the beginning. AISF, which claimed that 10 councillors were with them, did not field even one candidate to the students’ council. This was because of the AISF-KSU-MSF alliance,” Dev alleged. Dev said that the reason for the clash at MG university was SFI leaders preventing bogus voting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/sfi-files-counter-cases-against-aisf-members/articleshow/87230844.cms||---

Karat’s reaction came even as Anupama was on a hunger strike in front of the Secretariat on Saturday. “It’s just inhuman. There is no doubt about it. It’s a complicated case since it’s been a year since the baby was taken away. The mother who has adopted the baby obviously considers the baby as hers. The adoption laws are also very strict. It’s a tragedy of tremendous proportions. As far as rights and morality are concerned, there is no doubt that what happened is totally wrong and Anupama must get her baby back,” she told media persons in New Delhi. Meanwhile, CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan dismissed the allegations that Anupama’s baby was taken away from her with the knowledge of the CPM district leadership. He said the party would only wish for the reunion of Anupama with her child. “CPM will not justify or support any sort of wrongdoing. These issues must be legally settled. Party can’t intervene in such matters,” he said. CPM leader PK Sreemathi, who admitted to being in the know about Anupama’s predicament, said she did not receive any complaint from Anupama, but came to know about the development when Brinda Karat told her about it. “Party and government have clarified their stand in the case. I have nothing more to add,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/just-inhuman-anupama-must-get-her-baby-back-brinda-karat/articleshow/87230855.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After two years in jail, uncle acquitted of rape charge||MUMBAI: After spending two years in jail, the 47-year-old uncle of a 16-year-old girl was acquitted on charges of raping her and getting her pregnant after the court observed that the victim’s conduct could not be relied upon. The girl had named her uncle after a failed abortion left her bleeding and in hospital. The court pointed to the presence of a boy who the girl was close to. The girl said she had hidden her friendship with him as her parents did not like his community. The boy told police the girl showed interest in him. “Therefore, there is material on record to show that the victim and (the boy) were not only friends. The prosecution submitted that there was no need for the victim to protect (the boy) and, in fact, making false allegations against the accused will ruin her family life, but at such an age when there are love relations between the boy and girl, they first try to save the love relationship,” the special POCSO court said. The boy had also helped the girl procure abortion pills. “I do not find that any person will go to such extent to help when he was aware that an offence has been committed. No doubt friends help, but not to such an extent,” the court said. The court, while acquitting the accused, said, “There was inordinate delay in lodging a report and the reason has not been explained properly. Due to conduct of the victim, her evidence does not appear to be just and cogent,” the court said. While the alleged incident took place in March 2019, an FIR was lodged in June 2019. The girl had alleged that the incident took place when her sister and she had to go to her uncle’s house to sleep, as her house was being renovated. The accused, a father of three, was married to the girl’s paternal aunt. The girl did not disclose the incident to her family until her botched abortion came to light. The court said that the girl could not recall when exactly the incident occurred. “On perusal of evidence it can be seen the victim has not stated dates when the incident occurred. No doubt people do not recollect exact dates, but in this case, the victim was subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the accused, who was her uncle,” the court said. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-after-two-years-in-jail-uncle-acquitted-of-rape-charge/articleshow/87231722.cms||Rebecca Samervel

However, controversial former Waqf Board chairman, Wasim Rizvi, who faces corruption charges and was ostracized from the community after he moved Supreme Court to seek removal of few Quranic verses, may not put his hat in the ring. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Rizvi scotched speculation of putting up a tough contest for the top post. “I want to make it clear that I am not in the race. There are multiple cases pending against me and I can’t occupy a constitutional post at this juncture,” said Rizvi, who stunned detractors in April this year by getting himself elected to the Board from the mutawalli quota. With the chairperson’s election to be announced soon, heavyweight politician and Rampur scion Begum Noor Bano’s entry into the Board has fuelled speculation about her being the dark horse candidate. While lobbying has begun in earnest in the Shia community, Noor Bano, an arch rival of Rampur MP Azam Khan, could make history by becoming the first woman to head the Shia waqf board. TOI had reported on April 21 that Noor Bano with her overarching appeal in the community could be the “dark horse”. Talking to TOI, she said, “This is my maiden innings as Shia Waqf Board member. I want to serve my community and work for an image makeover of the Board, which is embroiled in corruption.” To a query if she would be in the fray for the top job, she said, “I am not here to do politics. I don't know to what extent I can serve , but I will ensure funds are not misused.” Another nominated member, Raza Hussain, told TOI that he’s sure Kalbe Jawad’s candidate will be elected chairman. “I hope Begum Noor Bano will support us,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/shia-board-polls-wasim-rizvi-says-wont-contest-noor-bano-is-dark-horse/articleshow/87231342.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Though both the vaccines are safe and effective, similar trend was witnessed nationally as Covishield coverage is more than Covaxin. However, the experience in Vidarbha during the past nine months shows that the districts where Covaxin was administered in large numbers have shown better control, less deaths, and fewer number of new cases. Overall too, the Covid-19 graph is at the baseline, especially in the last two months. However, the districts where more than 40% of people received Covaxin are in better condition, reveals data. In Vidarbha, Bhandara, Gondia and Washim are the three districts where Covaxin was given to more than 40% of the eligible population. Gondia has reported zero deaths, Washim 2 and Bhandara 2 casualties due to Covid-19 between July 21 and October 21, the period of 4 months since the second wave receded. Experts, however, said it is too early to correlate between the type of vaccine and Covid-19 control. “Though, Covaxin has shown very good results, Covishield is being administered in large numbers across the country. Cases and deaths have gone down in all districts of Vidarbha after the vaccination. Overall, it’s a success story of the vaccination,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. A senior government official, who has been associated with the vaccine distribution process, said there was no intention to distribute more Covaxin to certain districts. “Though both the vaccines were available in the country, Covishield was available in good quantity right from the start. As a result, more people got Covishield jabs in India. Sputnik V got approved in the later stage,” he said. Doctors in Gondia, Bhandara and Washim said the Covid situation is well under control and it could be due to near-equal distribution of both the vaccines. “As far as Washim is concerned, Covid casualty is less right from the vaccination started over there. Even at present, we are not getting many serious cases. Hospitalization is zero. All five patients as on date are recovering in home isolation,” said Dr Madhukar Rathod, civil surgeon of Washim.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/dists-with-40-covaxin-shots-see-less-deaths-cases-than-rest-of-vid/articleshow/87230274.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In September, the draft policy was okayed by the AMC’s standing committee which suggested one change, the rule mandating that citizens furnish proof that they have parking space before buying vehicles was dropped. The draft was handed over to the state-level committee which approved it on October 16. Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar said, "The state government approved the parking policy on October 16. We have to keep in mind that road space is limited and the available space has to be managed. The new policy is framed in a way that it caters to the parking needs of specific areas at specific times." The civic body will implement the policy in a phased manner as implementation all at once is not feasible, said an AMC official who did not wish to be named. He said AMC will carry out awareness drives before and after implementation of each phase. Under the new policy, monthly and annual permits will be given for common parking plots. The AMC plans to give parking permits covering streets around residential societies. The new policy encourages sharing of parking space. It states that due to the scarcity of parking space in Ahmedabad and uneven distribution of parking facilities, available space must be used effectively. "Areas such as CG Road, Ashram Road, Paldi, and other CBD areas see a peak in parking demand during office hours, while demand reduces on weekends," the policy says. "Parking spaces of office buildings, schools, banks and business parks, malls and parks also see variable use of parking space on weekdays and weekends." Other vehicles of an area are unable to use these parking spaces due to ownership and jurisdiction issues, the policy says. It says the disparity between supply and demand of parking space can be dealt with by sharing parking spaces. Also, the new policy makes provisions to encourage sharing of parking space between several buildings and facilities that are close to each other. The office-bearers concerned will have to give no-objection certificates for vehicles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-approves-new-amc-parking-policy/articleshow/87230858.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

However, junction at Jeppu near the Mangaladevi temple in Mangaluru was named after the Hindu God Parashurama, a decision taken not by the officials of the MCC, but the residents. Around the time the Mangaluru Smart City Ltd (MSCL) was developing roads, pavements and the circle in the vicinity of the Mangaladevi temple, a banner was erected by the residents, declaring its name ‘Parashurama Vrittha’, before the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) could deliberate on the issue, and adopt a resolution to that effect. MSCL has undertaken various development projects in the neighbourhood of Old Kent Road, Pandeshwar Temple Road, Mangaladevi Temple Road, among others – initiatives the cumulative cost of which is estimated to be around Rs 40 crore. This is not the first instance of people erecting banners indicating the preferred name they would have for a road or a junction. A few months ago, a banner was put up at the Pumpwell Flyover bearing the name ‘Veer Savarkar Flyover’, but it was removed later. Another banner subsequently appeared at the Mangaluru Junction Railway Station, which the outfit that put up the flyer wanted named ‘Veer Savarkar Railway Station, Mangaluru’. Mangaluru mayor Premanand Shetty told TOI that the MCC was yet to deliberate on naming the junction in Jeppu. “I have noticed the banner that declares that the junction is ‘Parashurama Vrittha’, but the MCC has made no proposal to rename the place. Unidentified people have put up the banner without the knowledge of the authorities concerned. Any such proposal must first be discussed in the MCC Council, and a resolution adopted to that effect,” Shetty added. He pointed out that the MCC Council had submitted a proposal to the government seeking to rename Lady Hill Circle after social reformer Sri Narayana Guru. “But we have adopted a resolution to name the road leading to the Mangaladevi temple after the shrine. We have submitted this to the MCC’s town planning committee as well. The MCC will publish the proposal in the newspapers inviting objections and suggestions from the public. The proposal will be discussed another time after the public consultation is held before it is formally submitted to the government,” the mayor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/junction-at-jeppu-in-mangaluru-named-after-parashurama-mayor-council-in-the-dark/articleshow/87230130.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kidnap, impersonation part of police probe||T’puram: With the police formally launching an inquiry into the case of missing child, filed by the child’s mother Anupama S Chandran, the case has gained a serious criminal angle involving kidnapping and impersonation. The police, which have now registered a case, included the charges for kidnapping, considered a grave offence. As per section 361 of the IPC, whoever takes or entices any minor male under 16 years, or under 18 years of age if a female, or any person of unsound mind, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor or person of unsound mind, without the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship. The offence will invite an imprisonment of seven years. Also, the name and address of the child’s father were given wrongly in the child’s birth certificate. As per section 419 of the IPC, whoever cheats by personation shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years. According to police, the first petition by the complainant was received in April but it had no mention of the missing child. After the second petition, which was about the missing child, the police summoned Anupama’s parents, who then produced the affidavit signed by Anupama, (which she later claimed was done forcefully). “When the police received the complaints, those were processed properly and disposed of. When the petitions later came from the higher authorities, the police then recorded the statements of the complainant and the parents. On the basis of legal advice, an FIR has been registered and the probe is going on,” said Balram Kumar Upadhyay, IG and city police commissioner (Thiruvananthapuram). “When police receive a complaint, they are duty-bound to register a case and investigate it. In a strict legal sense, if there was any delay in the matter, the department will have to initiate action against the police officers as it was a lapse on their part,” said Vinson M Paul, former DGP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kidnap-impersonation-part-of-police-probe/articleshow/87230875.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body had converted its Zakir Hussain and New Bytco Hospitals into Covid hospitals last year, where patients from Nashik city, rural Nashik areas, and neighbouring districts were treated. These two civic-run hospitals had been handling a substantial number of Covid patients. “With the decline in the number of Covid cases, we have restarted treatment for non-Covid patients at Dr Zakir Hussain Hospital since last week. We are also planning to do the same at the New Bytco Hospital soon,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC. Dr Zakir Hussain Hospital is located in the heart of the city and provides free medical services to a large number of people. “We have started our OPDs to treat non-Covid patients. Out of 150 beds, 100 beds have now been earmarked for non-Covid patients,” added Nagargoje. The remaining 50 beds on the top floor of the hospital have been kept for Covid patients. This floor has been completely segregated since Covid patients are being treated there, said the official. Nagargoje further said the health department will take similar steps at its New Bytco Hospital, which has 900 beds. The hospital is located in the Nashik Road area. There has been a sharp decline in the number of daily cases across Nashik city, even though the civic body is conducting 2,500-3,000 tests every day. At present, there are 229 active patients. Most of them are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. In the past six days, three deaths have been recorded. “If the cases start surging again, we will again convert these two into Covid hospitals,” said Nagargoje. According to him, the Diwali festival will be crucial as people are likely to travel during this period. Moreover, there will be a rush in the markets. Nagargoje has appealed to people to adhere to all Covid protocols even if they are fully vaccinated. “Since the weather is changing, there is an increase in cases of seasonal flu and the flu symptoms are similar to that of Covid. It would be prudent for people suffering from flu get to tested,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmcs-zakir-hussain-hosp-resumes-non-covid-treatment/articleshow/87228986.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

In a letter, the association said Mahadwar Road was a major marketplace for Diwali and that people from across the city and rural parts come there to shop. Every year, during the Diwali period, the road is closed to traffic, which, the traders said, hampers their business. A similar move this year will hit them hard as they are still recovering from the Covid-related losses, the letter stated. Association head Kiran Nakate said, “The administration should ask regular roadside vendors not to encroach upon roads and not allow new vendors to set up shop on the road. We are already facing tough competition from e-commerce sites and don’t need this additional problem.” Shopkeepers claimed that they did little business during Navaratra due to the barricading done by the district administration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/traders-want-mahadwar-road-to-stay-open-during-diwali/articleshow/87229000.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The proposal has been forwarded to the Centre after Ayodhya’s BJP MP, Lallu Singh, recommended the name change to the state government and Railways. “Naming the railway junction after Ayodhya is a natural procedure after Faizabad district was rechristened Ayodhya in 2018. This is being done to avoid confusion,” said a government spokesperson. The local MP sent the proposal and after necessary approvals the state government forwarded it to the Centre. Renaming of the station can be implemented only by the Railways,” said a government spokesperson. Suresh Kumar Sapra, divisional railway manager, Lucknow, told TOI the proposal would be sent to the home ministry. “On Ayodhya MP’s request, Railways sent the proposal to the state government, which has given its nod. Now, the proposal would be forwarded to the Union ministry of home affairs for final assent. Later, the ministry of railways will issue the necessary notification for changing the name of the railway station to Ayodhya Cantonment,” he said. On Diwali eve in 2018, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced renaming Faizabad district to Ayodhya to honour the birthplace of Lord Ram and “acknowledge the history of the area”. A week later, cabinet approved the decisiion. The district headquarters, however, continues to remain Faizabad. The UP government has already changed the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Mughalsarai railway junction to Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay junction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-govt-nod-to-rename-fzb-jn-as-ayodhya-cantt/articleshow/87231372.cms||---

In a succinct but poignant poem posted on a social media platform, Prof Sankarappillai links the pleas of Anupama for her baby with the wailing of a mother character for her child in the court of King Solomon referred to in the Old Testament. He then refers to similar pleas of different mothers to different despots and like Stalin and the devil character in the acclaimed poem “Bhoothapppatt” of Edassery. The poetry also subtly relates the links of Anupama’s pleas with the agonies faced by Late Eachara Warrier, who carried out a protected struggle to locate his son Rajan, who went missing after police arrested him during the Emergency. The poem also refers to the struggles of the mother of the daughters who were killed in Walayar. Joseph in her post demanded that the government not delay any more the return of the baby to Anupama. She said the heads of the child welfare committee and child development department should not be permitted to continue in their posts as they betrayed a mother and a baby. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kgs-sarah-joseph-support-anupama/articleshow/87230890.cms||---

The second round of counting of votes for the 15 seats of the graduate constituency began on Thursday, but by late evening, not a single candidate could cross the quota of 2,880 votes set for victory.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Festive sales up but spends still low||Diwali is just around the corner and the bustle on the streets and markets, crowded stores and malls reflects a positive consumer sentiment. People who observed restraint, skipping festivities and gatherings last year are going all out, albeit with caution, and not just in fear of Covid-19. Clothing and home décor stores, developers’ offices and residential building sites, malls and departmental stores, jewellery and electronic goods showrooms, and even tour operators are witnessing good footfalls and sales. However, consumer spending is evidently restrained over the past fortnight, given less cash in hand with professionals amid rising prices of fuel and essentials and reducing profits of businesses. Jewellery sales improve; exchange of gold continuesWith many weddings being organised post Diwali, jewellery sales have revived in a big way due to pent-up demand. Fuelled by this, gold imports have also increased to 3.7 metric tonnes (MT) in September, as jewellers stocked up on gold to prepare for the festive season. Yellow metal prices are hovering around Rs 49,000 per 10 grams in Ahmedabad. Even though the demand is upbeat, jewellers suggest people are frugal in spending, as a majority of purchases are being made either by exchanging old gold or through credit cards. About 50% of wedding jewellery purchase volumes come by exchanging gold. "People don’t want to part with cash and are still keeping their savings aside. Most purchases are only for wedding occasions, and many are selling off their old jewellery to buy wedding jewellery," said Chinubhai Choksi, president, Manek Chowk Choksi Mahajan. Bullion demand from investors is good say industry players. "Demand for coins and bars is good. Many have booked for delivery on Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras," said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). Electronics, home appliances market lukewarmElectronic and home appliances retailers wear a deserted look despite festive season offers. Pent-up demand for electronics and home appliances was seen last year soon after the lockdown, when people were still working from their homes, and they bought electronic devices and appliances they needed. However, dealers suggest, this time, the demand is less because of shrinking disposable incomes as a function of the rise in price of fuel and essentials. "Customer footfalls are less this time around, and so are sales. While prices of home appliances have surged by 15%, costlier fuel and rising costs of essential items are entirely consuming their incomes, leaving little surplus. Only those who really need appliances tend to buy them, because of shrinking liquidity," said Bhavesh Waria, president, Ahmedabad Electronics Dealers’ Association. Clothing and apparel demand picks up wellFabric and clothing markets in Ratanpole and Panchkuwa in addition to branded clothing stores, have been witnessing increased footfall and good sales too. Even as discounts are barely rolled out, the demand for fabrics as well as readymade garments is strong. Kirit Patel, president, Panchkuwa Cloth Merchants’ Association, said, "The demand has picked up with better footfalls and sales. We see people coming to buy festive and wedding apparels even though there are no discount offers. People have not enjoyed festivities last year due to higher Covid cases and therefore, pent-up demand is fuelling sales." Textile wholesalers suggest with an increase in cotton and yarn prices, besides higher job-work charges, fabrics are expected to get costlier after Diwali. The same goes for artificial silk sarees. Dry fruit sales remain slow:Even though prices of dry fruits have remained the same, in this festive season is continued to stay muted. Dry fruit dealers said people are spending less and the trend of corporate gifting hasn’t yet picked up due to several companies continuing with the work from home model. "The business is barely 50% of the pre-Covid levels and the same as last year. Prices have remained the same or reduced in some cases and yet, the demand hasn’t picked up. People have less disposable incomes at hand due to costlier essentials and as a result they’re spending on other needs than dry fruits," said Ramesh Motiani, a city-based dryfruit dealer. Vehicle sales might be worse than last year’s Automobile sales are expected to be worse than the pandemic year, even in the Diwali festive season. While car demand is good, supply constraints are hampering the dealers’ revenues with limited sales, suggest estimates by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) – Gujarat. Meanwhile, two-wheeler demand is still muted with students yet to return in numbers to institutions. Dussehra car sales remained low and clocked an average 10% decline against last year’s Dussehra. "After the BS-VI rollout, vehicles have become costlier by at least 20%. The surge in fuel prices too is a great deterrent as the cost of vehicle ownership is going up. While bookings for cars are good, we’re barely able to meet supply requirements and looking at the global shortage of semiconductors, we’re looking at further worsening of the situation," said Pranav Shah, chairman – Gujarat, FADA. Travel agents finally see business recoveringGiven the receding of Covid-19 cases, lifting of restrictions and increased vaccination, travel has begun picking up. Agents claim that there is at least 25% more bookings than in last year and people are targeting both short-distance and longer trips. "The bookings typically took place over the past month and a half. With international travel restrictions, domestic travel has gained traction with destinations in northern India, Rajasthan and Goa being among tourists’ preferences," said Virendra Shah, chairman, Travel Agents’ Association of India (TAAI). "Hotel tariffs at popular destinations have increased and people are willing to shell out extra, provided they get flexible cancellation and refund policy, given the Covid-19 situation," Shah added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/festive-sales-up-but-spends-still-low/articleshow/87230900.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Smartphones, tabs to be given by November-end||LUCKNOW: The state government will start distribution of tablets and smartphones to eligible youth and skilled workers by the end of November, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Saturday. Speaking at the foundation-laying ceremony of a government medical college in Sultanpur, the CM said: “In order to equip the youth of UP with the latest technology so that they can benefit from online studies, we will start distributing tablets and laptops from the last week of November.” The cabinet had cleared a proposal to this effect on October 5, in a move which appears aimed at reaching out to young voters in the state ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. An expenditure of Rs 3,000 crore has been approved in the supplementary budget for providing free tablets and smartphones to youth enrolled in graduate, postgraduate, diploma, skill development, paramedical, nursing courses under the state government and skilled workers enrolled on the Sewa Mitra portal. The CM also launched 126 development projects worth Rs 46.33 crore in Sultanpur and 99 development projects worth Rs 334.24 crore in Ambedkarnagar. Hitting out at Opposition parties like Congress and Samajwadi Party, the CM said their only agenda is to stall development and ensure that all the benefits of programmes and schemes accrue to members of certain families. “One family in Delhi and another family in Lucknow only worked to steal money meant for the poor. People were dying of hunger, and there was lack of basic amenities and health facilities. When Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he gave the slogan of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and ensured that all the deserving beneficiaries got the benefits of various schemes without any discrimination,” he said. The CM said that once the 500-bed hospital in Sultanpur is ready, locals would no longer have to travel to Lucknow or Delhi for treatment. Sultanpur would also get the maximum benefits of Purvanchal Expressway and the industrial clusters coming up along it as youth would not have to go out for jobs, he added. At Ambedkarnagar, the CM said that more than 42,000 houses have been given in the district under PM Awas rural scheme. “Along with that, more than 2.55 lakh toilets were constructed under Swachh Bharat Mission and around 1.40 lakh free gas connections were given under Ujjwala scheme. More than 3.95 lakh farmers are getting benefits of the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/smartphones-tabs-to-be-given-by-nov-end/articleshow/87231394.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Dr Harish E, consultant, surgical oncology, KMC Hospital, Mangaluru has observed a slow rise in breast cancer cases among men. He told TOI: “Though the incidence of breast cancer is rare in men compared to women, we are seeing at least two cases a year. Breast cancer attacks men when cancer cells are formed in the male breast tissue. About 10 years ago, breast cancer was seen in men of the age 50-70 years has now come down to 40-50 years.’’ Out of the 140 breast cancer cases that Dr Harish had operated on last year, two were male breast cancer cases. However, the ratio is such that out of a total of 100 patients 99 of them are women and only one is a man. However, of this, 60-70% of men getting diagnosed with breast cancer are in the advanced stage of cancer — third or last stage. This is because the cancer cells in men spread aggressively when compared to women and often ignore symptoms like lumps and ulcers. These symptoms then advance to become back pain, jaundice, and breathlessness. Men with a history of breast cancer in the family, men with gynecomastia have a much higher chance of getting breast cancer, Dr Harish added. Dr Krithika Murugan, consultant surgical oncologist, HCG Cancer Hospital, Bengaluru said: “Though the incidence of male breast cancer is less than one per cent, the causes are more or less the same as for female breast cancer but it becomes important to test for gene mutations, especially the well known BRCA gene. Also, ever since the pandemic, we are noticing that the size and stage of tumours is more advanced at presentation which could be due to delayed hospital visits. We are studying the influence of the pandemic on cancer presentation and treatment among our group of patients,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/lifestyle-changes-see-a-rise-in-breast-cancer-in-men/articleshow/87230774.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Kochi||In a first in 90 years, Kerala Kalamandalam admits girls in Kathakali course||THRISSUR: For the first time in its 90-year history, Kerala Kalamandalam has started admitting girl students for the Kathakali course. Kalamandalam sources said that out of the 10 students who have been admitted for Kathakali in Class VII this year nine are girls. Kalamandalam vice-chancellor T K Narayanan said “this year we decided to fulfil the long-pending demand of giving admission to girls for Kathakali.” Art critic K K Gopalakrishnan said even though Kathakali is perceived as a highly masculine art form and female roles are traditionally handled by men, there have been attempts by women to take up this art right from the 18th century. Gopalakrishnan, who has devoted one chapter on ‘women in Kathakali’ in his research book ‘Kathakali Dance-Theatre’, said more women had started practising this art between 1970 and 1990. Some women from abroad had also undergone short-term courses in Kathakali at Kalamandalam earlier, he said. Even though there are some women Kathakali artists, most of them have been trained under individual masters or by private institutes. “It is a really remarkable development that girls are now getting an opportunity to undergo institutional training in Kathakali. At Kalamandalam the students will get exposed to systematic training from a diverse spectrum of teachers,” said Ranjini Suresh, a Kathakali exponent from Tripunithura. Requirement of harsh physical training, including ‘chavuttiyuzhichil’ (massage by feet) is often cited as a constraint for initiating girls into this field. “We will evolve appropriate training modules for girls,” said Thulasi Kalamandalam, the faculty member who heads the Kathakali Thekkan Style. Artists and teachers point out that girls may not require rigorous physical training considering their natural body flexibility. The students who have got admission are also thrilled. “I’m excited as I could get admission in the first batch of girls for Kathakali at Kalamandalam,” said Devananda S R, from Muthuvilakkade, near Sasthamkotta in Kollam. “I was keen to study Kathakali, especially at Kalamandalam. My aunt had studied dance there. I’m sure that girls will also be able to perform well just like boys in Kathakali,” said A Krishnapriya from Alappuzha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/now-girls-to-learn-kathakali-at-kalamandalam/articleshow/87230893.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Jaipur||Covid-19: 83% Jaisalmer vaccinated, thanks to primary healthcare workers||JAISALMER: The community healthcare workers in Jaisalmer have worked hard to ensure people located in all parts of the district get vaccinated. With the cumulative Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country surpassing the 100-crore milestone on Thursday, 83% population of the district have got their first doses. From reaching 90% of the remote areas to battling hesitancy to get vaccinated, the primary healthcare workers did it all to achieve this feat. Rural ANMs Anita and Renu travelled in camels to get the job done in extremely arid regions such as Karda and Pochina. While Anita, who is a mother to a 7-month-old child, carried her baby along and even breastfed during work, Renu, despite being diabetic, travelled across 95% houses in the hamlets of Karda area under Myazlar PHC on foot and on camels to convince people for vaccination. CMHO Dr Kunal Sahu said they will soon achieve the 100% vaccination target. Lauding the hard work of ANMs Anita and Renu, Sahu said due to the untiring efforts of the ANMs remote villages of the district such as Karda and Pochina were 96% vaccinated. Nimba panchayat sarpanch representative Liaquat Ali said more than 98% people in the 13 villages of his gram panchayat got their jabs. Ali said primary healthcare workers reached remote areas on foot, camels and tractors. District collector Ashish Modi said, "Earlier, there were a lot of misconceptions about vaccination in the border areas, but we roped in influential people of the areas and religious gurus. Now awareness has increased and people are coming forward and inspiring others for vaccination."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/83-jaisalmer-vaxxed-thanks-to-primary-healthcare-workers/articleshow/87230892.cms||---
---||Nagpur||2 pvt cos to cover even unborn child under health insurance||Nagpur: The importance of health insurance has become even more evident during the pandemic. Currently, insurance companies do not offer cover for birth defects or surgical problems during infancy. But soon they will start offering health cover to even the unborn babies. The national executive committee of the Indian Association of Paediatric Surgeons (IAPS) has been following up the issue since long with the insurance companies. Recently, the IAPS received a final breakthrough when two private insurance companies agreed to help insure the unborn child.Dr Ravindra Ramadwar, a Nagpurian and president of IAPS, told TOI that the congenital malformations are diagnosed in the antenatal sonography and many parents still opt for abortion as the surgeries bring major cost burden for many families. “Many Indian couples do not have the financial liberty to get their child treated at hospitals of their choice. They opt for abortion. This will stop with the new initiative taken by some insurance companies after our follow-up,” said Dr Ramadwar. He also announced this important decision in the inaugural session of 47th annual conference of the ASPS on a virtual platform on Friday. Initially, Star Health and Allied Insurance Company have agreed to cover the unborn child. Dr S Prakash, MD of Star Health, said that the company is passionate towards its responsibilities towards babies. “We have rolled out a new policy where a couple enrolled with us for 2 years would be entitled for insurance cover for any birth defect that their child is born with.” He claimed that the company has finished all its formalities and is awaiting IRDA nod before it can roll out this policy for the benefit of the common public “in the next few weeks”. Union minister of state for finance, Dr Bhagwat Karad, who was also a practicing paediatric surgeon at Aurangabad before joining politics, welcomed the development. “I am happy to know that the two companies have agreed to insure the unborn child and infants. I will do my best to speed up the process at the IRDAI, which falls under my purview,” said Dr Karad. Senior paediatric surgeon from Nagpur, Dr Rajendra Saoji, told TOI that the decision will not only benefit the parents but also the field of paediatric surgery in the long-term. “Due to the complications and financial difficulties associated with it, there is constant decline in the cases of infant surgeries, resulting in less takers for the paediatric surgery specialization. This decision will revive and improve the situation of this important branch,” he said. # Insurance before birth - Two insurance companies agree to provide health insurance to unborn babies- Congenital malformations diagnosed during sonography to be covered - Minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery in infants to get insurance cover - Fetal surgeries and use of nanotechnology and nanobots to deliver targeted therapy||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/2-pvt-cos-to-cover-even-unborn-child-under-health-insurance/articleshow/87229693.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The police said, quoting a complaint by the clerk with the ward office of the TMC, that the incident occurred on October 18 in the evening as the TMC staff were evicting hawkers from the streets. The accused had put up a stall and the team members objected to it and wanted him to remove the stall. The accused instead wielded a knife and said, “We have chopped off the finger of your officer, now we will chop of your neck.” The staff member also said that it was after a discussion on the matter with seniors in the TMC, he had filed the complaint against the hawker, the police said. In an earlier incident on August 30, a hawker, Amarjeet Yadav, brandishing a knife attacked assistant municipal commissioner, Kalpita Pimpale, and her security guard. The accused chopped off three of her fingers over the issue of evicting hawkers from Kasarwadavali.

The area is not connected with Bisalpur pipeline, hence, government supplies water through tankers. Without giving any exact reasons, the water tankers have stopped coming in the area, forcing people to purchase water from private tanker agencies. Population of about 15,000 is affected by the crisis. Manoj Kumar, resident of Kanak Vihar near Sirsi Road in ward 50 said, “Ours is a JDA-approved colony and we have paid all the development charges but still no pipeline is connected with our area. Earlier, the government-approved tankers used to supply water but now they have stopped coming. We are fed up and forced to purchase private tankers at high rates.” Ward councillor Sanju Devi said, “The situation is really bad in our area. Contractors have stopped the supply and there is no other option. I have complained many times to the PHED officials but no solution has been given. We purchase tankers from nearby private firms. Two people in our area have boring, so they do help us but the water level is going down, so that is also not a permanent solution.” When TOI tried to contact executive engineer of PHED Devendra, he didn’t take the call. Another PHED official, who didn’t want to be named said, “There are two government contractors responsible for water supply in the wards. However, there is some kind of dispute between the two and both have stopped working. We have sent a complaint to the headquarters as well and we hope there will be some resolution soon.” In ward 51, area near Paanchawala, councillor Sukhpreet Bansal said this has been a long-standing issue without any permanent solution. She said that the residents have complained many times but nothing has been done on the part of the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/water-woes-for-residents-of-ward-50-51-as-phed-stops-tanker-supply/articleshow/87230904.cms||---

Two police officers in the rank of special sub-inspector (SSI) will be handling the traffic marshal bikes mounted with a siren from 9 am till night. They will be tasked with moving around their jurisdictional area during peak hours and whenever traffic jam occurs. The officer can impose fines on traffic violations besides clearing vehicles parked on roads obstructing traffic. Another unique factor attached to the traffic marshal is that the officer can quickly respond to road accidents and help victims with first aid before rushing them to hospitals on ambulances. CoP Karthikeyan said that each bike will be equipped with a first aid kit which the officer can use for the victims. The police officer entrusted with the task will be trained on providing first aid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/trichy-traffic-control-units-get-marshal-bikes/articleshow/87231402.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Deshmukh denies ‘anti-party’ activities in show cause reply||Nagpur: Congress leader Ashish Deshmukh has refuted allegations of ‘anti-party’ activities in his reply to a show cause notice issued by the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC). Deshmukh filed his reply well within the one-week deadline, which ended on Friday, thus ensuring that no suo motu disciplinary action against him was taken. TOI had reported on October 17 about how the MPCC show cause notice stated that complaints against Deshmukh had been received about his alleged anti-party activities. One of the key incidents mentioned was about a photograph of his with a BJP candidate for the local body by-polls which went viral. Social media was rife with rumours that Deshmukh was canvassing for a BJP candidate. Though his family had always been Congress loyalists, with father Ranjeet being a former cabinet minister, Ashish started his political journey with BJP and won the Katol assembly seat in 2014. Following differences with senior state-level BJP leaders, Deshmukh quit in 2018 and joined the Congress. His former association with the BJP gave more traction to the viral photograph with quite a few local Congress leaders complaining to the MPCC. Sources in the MPCC told TOI that Deshmukh has denied the entire viral photo incident. “He has told MPCC that the photograph is not genuine and hence, that the entire allegation is false,” said the source. TOI tried reaching Deshmukh but he did not respond to calls. MPCC’s general secretary Devanand Pawar too refused to disclose details of Deshmukh’s reply. Pawar said, “All I can confirm is that we have received his reply. We will study it point by point and then present our findings before our state president Nana Patole.” No timeline has been given by Pawar on completion of this process. After his entry into the Congress in 2018, Deshmukh entered the electoral battlefield straightaway against Devendra Fadnavis in Nagpur South-West constituency. Though it was his first time in that constituency, Deshmukh managed to secure almost 60,000 votes and emerged runner-up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/deshmukh-denies-anti-party-activities-in-show-cause-reply/articleshow/87230334.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Sri Lankan navy handed over the body to the Indian Coast Guard at the international maritime boundary line (IMBL) in the morning.The minister also handed over the solatium of Rs 10 lakh announced by chief minister M K Stalin to the kin of the deceased fisherman.Rajkiran drowned in the sea after a SL navy vessel hit the trawler in which he and two other fishermen -- S Sugandhan, 22 and A Xavier, 38 of Kottaipattinam --were fishing on October 18. The two fishermen were arrested by the SL navy.The fishermen of Kottaipattinam staged a protest by not venturing into the sea since October 20, alleging that the Sri Lankan navy had hit the vessel leading it to sink.On the contrary, the navy website stated that Indian fishing boat had sunk northwest off the Kovilan lighthouse in Sri Lankan waters in the evening of October 18. It maintained that the trawler, in an attempt to evade SL navy, collided with naval craft. The trawler sank in the incident.Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention for the release the arrested fishermen and for bringing back the body of Rajkiran.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/sri-lankan-navy-hands-over-body-of-indian-fisherman/articleshow/87231410.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Must establish control of accused to prove ‘conscious possession’: Bombay HC in 1991 NCB case||MUMBAI: Upholding an acquittal in a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) case over an alleged haul of mandrax tablets 30 years ago, Bombay high court held that “confessional statement alleged to have been given by the accused is essentially a weak piece of evidence which does not have any corroboration’’ particularly when no proof of ‘conscious possession’ is shown. “Ipse dixitism (dogmatic assertion) of the prosecution witnesses cannot be accepted as a gospel truth…’’ said the HC bench of Justice Sadhana Jadhav and Justice Prithviraj Chavan, adding that conviction cannot be based on ‘conjectures and surmises.’ The bench said this after noting that the NCB evidence mostly comprised its officers’ testimonies and that the agency wanted the court to “rely on and accept as a voluntary statement” a statement of the accused recorded on four occasions while in their custody. The case was of an alleged seizure from a tempo in August 1991 at then Bombay Port Trust of seven packets weighing 480 kg containing lungis, and within it hidden the drug Methaqualone (mandrax). A sample of 42 contraband tablets with an ‘M’ and “swastik” mark on either side was taken, weighed and sealed. The lungis were taken separately and packed in cartons. “In order to prove “conscious possession” of the contraband, it is necessary for the prosecution to establish direct control of the accused over the article,” said the HC, citing a 2008 judgment. The HC also said the agency has not shown where the consignment was loaded and which country it was destined for. “It is an unsolved mystery as to who was the real owner of the consignment and what was his name,” said the HC verdict authored by Justice Chavan. The HC also relied on a Supreme Court 2002 verdict where it said, “Possession and ownership need not always go together but the minimum requisite element which has to be satisfied is custody or control over the goods.” A resident of Thane district was arrested, tried and acquitted in 1996 by a special judge designated under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in Mumbai. The NCB appealed against the judgement. The charges against him were under Section 8(c ) of the Act for alleged possession and transport, Section 23 for illegal import, export and transshipment of drugs along with Section 22 (punishment based on quantity of drug ranging from 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment for intermediate quantities to 20 years for commercial and fine). Also invoked were offences of abetment and attempt under Section 28 and of conspiracy under Section 29, the punishment for which is what the main offence attracts. A central excise superintendent had received information about the consignment and had forwarded it in writing to his deputy director for action on August 29, 1991. The NCB officers were called and decided to intercept the tempo when it entered BPT. During the raid, the accused standing beside the consignment was apprehended, as was a man who came to clear it. Their statements were recorded by NCB the next day and the arrests were made on August 31. The HC said the “prosecution case itself stands vitiated on account of non-compliance of Section 42 (2) (which requires sending of information to immediate superior in 72 hours) and Section 50 (right granted to a suspect to be searched before a gazette officer or magistrate) of the NDPS Act.” The HC found two prosecution witnesses contradicted each other, and it was not shown the information was relayed as legally mandated. The HC observed, “Astonishingly, the complaint is sans any reference of sending copy” to superiors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/must-establish-control-of-accused-to-prove-conscious-possession-in-mumbai-hc-in-91-ncb-case/articleshow/87231765.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath to be ‘panna pramukh’ of Booth 246 in Gorakhpur City||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is the ‘panna pramukh’ (in charge of a page in a voter list) for booth No 246 in the Gorakhhpur City Vidhan Sabha constituency, where he is registered as a voter himself. Being the panna pramukh, he will reach out to the voters who have their names on the same page as him. He will not be the only panna pramukh for that booth because the voter list may be long. Depending on the number of pages in voter list, there is one panna pramukh for every page. In that case, a booth may have multiple panna pramukhs whose ultimate job will be to sway the voter in the party’s favour by telling them about the welfare schemes of the BJP governments at the centre and in state and other achievements that brought laurels to the country.  “If more than one party functionaries have their names on the same page of the voter list, the seniormost will have the responsibility,” said a party functionary. A page of the voter list has about 60 names and that will add up to around 12 families.  Like chief minister Yogi Adityanath, every MP, MLA and office-bearer of the party will be a panna pramukh for the booth where he is registered as a voter. In Gorakhpur, former Union minister and MP Shiv Pratap Shukla, MLA Dr Radha Mohan Das Agrawal and mayor Sitaram Jaiswal are also the panna pramukhs for the booths where they are registered as voters. At a time when most of the political parties in the state are trying to reach out to voters and it’s the lack of an organizational set-up that might make it a little difficult for them to do so, state BJP has its vast army of foot soldiers, elected people’s representatives and popular leaders of the national stature as its biggest strength. The party has 50 lakh ‘panna pramukhs’ in UP which has around 1.6 lakh booths. BJP will try to forge a direct connect with voters.  The party’s ‘main bhi panna pramukh’ campaign was launched on October 8 when state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh assumed the responsibility for his booth to start the campaign. UP BJP, which started micro planning in election strategy since 2014, has harped big time on panna pramukhs. “Prior to this, panna pramukhs were appointed a few days ahead of the elections and it was never with such a bang,” said the party leader. It was decided in the executive committee meeting of the state BJP held in March that panna pramukh will be a permanent appointee. A panna pramukh is a booth level functionary. Each of them have been verified by the party. And, they will have a key role in the party’s membership drive which might be started soon to add new members. As part of its micro-management and micro-planning, the state BJP has made booth the centre of its focus. The party is appointing key functionaries at the booth level besides having a 21-member booth level committee at every booth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cm-to-be-panna-pramukh-of-booth-246-in-gorakhpur-city/articleshow/87231414.cms||Neha Shukla

Sandip Desai, Western Maharashta head of AAP, said, “As per state government rule, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation workers are allowed to take advance amount of Rs 12,500, which is later recovered from their salaries over the next 10 months. Still, the civic administration is saying that only Rs 8,000 can be taken as advance. This is unjust.”  After the meeting, Desai added that the administration has assured them that if goods and services tax grant is received, then this will definitely be considered. “If any decision is not taken till October 26, then we will be conducting a 'Thaalinaad' andolan outside KMC building,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/aap-warns-of-stir-over-advance-pay-for-civic-staff/articleshow/87229065.cms||---

The structure measuring 40cm wide 75cm in diameter was used for making oil to burn the lamps placed in public places and in temples. While the present day’s site where the oil press was found appears secluded, ancient antiques recently identified in the vicinity indicates the village could have been a significant habitation site and possibly, a transit point centuries back.Based on the inputs provided by Kumaraguru Nathan, a student of the Tamil University in Thanjavur about the presence of a stone oil press like object, ‘Yadhum Oore Yavarum Keleer’, a group comprising archaeology enthusiasts studied the site in Koodalur village. The inscription found in the object confirmed that the object was a stone oil press. Based on the style of the script found, the period of the stone oil press was dated back to the 10th century, epigraphists confirmed the claims. The script that reads ‘Sri Pidaran Mallan Sekku’ in Tamil indicates that a person named Mallan reciting holy poems in Saivite temple, like the present day’s odhuvar in HR&CE temples, had donated the stone oil press to a temple in the village. While there are no temples nearby, enthusiasts said that the remains of a Siva temple were found nearby. “Soolakkal (a stone with trident sign) was found at the site, a temple should have existed in the village. The stone oil press could have been gifted to produce oil for burning the lamps,” V Parthiban, coordinator of the group said. The survival of the press even as the temple vanished could be because that it was available for public use to produce oil even for medicinal purposes. A few metres away, the group also identified centuries-old Ayyanar stone idols measuring 120cm in height. Previously, similar Chola-era stone oil presses were identified at multiple villages in Perambalur district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/10th-century-chola-era-stone-oil-press-identified-in-karur-village/articleshow/87231419.cms||Deepak Karthik

Hindus could not celebrate their festivals. Today, the state is riot-free and people celebrate their festivals without fear,” he said at Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan organised by OBC Morcha in Lucknow on Saturday. “The previous government used to consider the family as the state and every relative was involved in loot. All relations reminded of the Mahabharata. Entire family was the ‘kaliyugi’ version of Mahabharat,” he said. SP extended support to the UPA government in 2004 with the intention to hurt Hindu sentiments and added that “Ramdrohi can never be a well-wisher.” Youths suffered from identity crisis and did not get jobs as per their abilities, he said, adding people used to extort money from aspirants for jobs. “Today youth from every section of the society is getting the benefit of the government’s schemes. Our government has made self-employment possible for about 60 lakh people through Vishwakarma Shram Samman. The artisans of various trades have been provided with loans and subsidies after they were given training,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cm-oppn-parties-are-anti-hindu-hurt-peoples-sentiments/articleshow/87231430.cms||---

While Thane district has the highest number of such unvaccinated people at 15.3 lakh, Nashik district is close behind at 14.1 lakh, followed by Aurangabad district at 10.8 lakh. The state government’s ‘Mission Yuva Swasthya’, a joint immunisation campaign planned by the public health department and the higher and technical education department from October 25 to November 2, aims to cover a major chunk of these beneficiaries. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid-19 task force, said the reasons for more than two crore adults in the state remaining unvaccinated could be many. “Compared to the urban youth, many rural youngsters don’t have easy access to vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy has also been observed among sections of the 18-44 group. Covid infection in the past and the related delay is also responsible,” he said. While institutes of higher learning across the state have already started offline classes from October 20, experts have raised concerns over the vulnerability of the 18-44 group. “This age group is very active and highly mobile. If they are fully protected, it could lower chances of possible transmission of the disease,” Pandit said. As part of Mission Yuva Swasthya, special vaccination sessions are being planned in colleges for students, teachers and the support staff. While the daily progress of the drive will be recorded on CoWIN portal as well as on Google Sheets, the best-performing college, district and region will be recognised by the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/over-2cr-in-18-44-age-group-yet-to-get-first-jab-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87231438.cms||Prasad Joshi

Police have refused to divulge the suspects’ identities till they are arrested and questioned. The incident occurred opposite an eatery at Talawade Chowk along the Pune-Solapur highway. One of the deceased, Santosh Jagtap, had criminal record. The other deceased, Swagat Khaire, was part of the group that had opened fire on Jagtap. The Loni Kalbhor police on Friday night registered two FIRs — one against Khaire and four others, and the other against Jagtap’s personal bodyguard, Shailendra Singh, on the charge of gunning down Khaire. “We will get into the bottom of the case within 24 hours,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, adding, “The motive remains unclear — Jagtap and the assailants have long criminal records. The assailants are residents of Uruli Kanchan and nearby areas.” “We will collect all details of criminals/gangs in the Loni Kalbhor police limits in a month so that we can verify their antecedents and monitor their movements. We will be also taking preventive action against them,” Gupta said. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI that Sassoon General Hospital, in its advance post-mortem report, has certified the cause of Jagtap’s death as four bullet injuries. “The hospital has extracted the bullets from his body,” Patil said, adding, “We have not recovered the firearms from the Singh and Monu Singh (Jagtap’s other bodyguard). They are recuperating in a private hospital and have claimed that their weapons are missing. We will question them once they are discharged,” she said. Senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi from the Loni Kalbhor police said, “We have registered a case of murder against Singh as CCTV footage shows that he had chased and opened fire on Khaire. Singh has claimed that he has is a firearms licence but has not furnished any evidence to back that claim.” Mokashi said the bullet fired by Singh pierced Khaire’s spinal cord and got struck between his nose and eyes. “We have recorded statements of more than 15 witnesses and more will become clear after all assailants are arrested,” he said. Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said, “Jagtap’s funeral was held without incident at Rahu village in Daund under police cover. No law and order problems were reported in or around Daund. We are coordinating with the Pune police to arrest the assailants.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/police-detain-2-assailants-in-firing-incident/articleshow/87230366.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The Covid-19 Death Ascertaining Committee (CDAC) will consist of administrative officials and health officials who will determine the cause of death where death certificate does not mention Covid as the primary cause. In directions issued by additional chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh on Saturday, all district magistrates and divisional commissioners were informed that the compensation would be issued from State Disaster Relief Fund and would be released on the basis of names registered on the relief commissioner office’s website. “Death certificates for claiming this compensation should have ‘death due to Covid-19’ written on them. In addition, a committee will be formed as per directions of the ministry of health and family welfare at the district level to verify deaths due to Covid,” Singh said. The committee will consist of the additional district magistrate, chief medical officer, additional CMO, principal or head of department of medical college and a specialist.

Nitin Khandale, a ZP teacher from Jalgaon, said this year too lower primary schools have been shut and not every child has access to online education. “Many teachers who are coming up with their own assessment methods. The first semester is ending in October and hence there should be clear instructions from the SCERT and ensure parity across the state,” said Khandale. A teacher from the Konkan region, Shamshuddin Attar, said the SCERT must give clear guidelines on assessment patterns to avoid incorrect interpretations at different local levels. “From Class I -VIII, a semester pattern is followed while class IX and X have an annual pattern. The headmaster’s association has already written it to the SCERT,” said Attar. According to a senior SCERT official, unnecessary confusion was being created as teachers know they have to follow the examination and evaluation pattern they have been doing so till now. “The only change is that instead of offline, they need to do it online wherever classes are being held online,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/zp-teachers-seek-clarity-on-assessment-pattern/articleshow/87230398.cms||Ardhra Nair

A senior Savitribai Phule Pune University official said a decision will be taken during a meeting of the board of examination on October 27. “Many educationists feel that offline exams are essential to upholding the quality and prestige of the university,” he said. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce in Shivajinagar, said offline exams are better to assess students. “However, it won’t be possible this semester. Many students in Pune colleges are from outside and without opening hostels, there is no place for them to stay,” said Zunjarrao. He said not all students are fully vaccinated still. Vasundhara Vanarase, a law student at Marathwada Mitra Mandal’s College of Commerce, said upcoming exams must be held online. “Students need to acclimatise to in-person classes and exams,” said Vanarase. BVoc media and communication student Anushka Chalke said, “The first-semester exam must be online and for the next, offline exams can be held,” she said.

Principals held preliminary online meetings with heads of departments and other key administrative staff on Saturday since schools are scheduled to reopen on Monday for most and Tuesday for the rest. In most schools, gyms, auditoria and other halls will be utilised for the examinations and will be sanitized before and after each test. Most principals sounded happy that exams would be finally happening and said this was the first step towards normalisation. However, they are waiting for the state to give a go-ahead for campus reopening so that arrangements can be made. Most principals said that unless the state permits campuses to reopen, offline exams cannot be held. However, they hoped there would be some news next week because even CBSE schools are looking at offline exams. Schools said they have made rosters for their teachers who will be external examiners and invigilators in other schools. These rosters were prepared for March 2021, but were not used since the exams were not held. St Xavier’s Collegiate School will make candidates sit in the gymnasium and auditorium. “We have to keep six-feet distance between students and need four times the space we used in the pre-pandemic times,” said Father Thamacin Arulappa, the principal. Acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys John Stephen said, “We will sanitize the four halls before the ICSE exam in the morning and then again before the ISC exam in the afternoon. There is enough gap between the two exams.” Teachers will be stationed at the gate and on the way to the halls to prevent huddling. Father Rodney Borneo, principal of St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, said he and his students were relieved as this was the beginning of normalisation. “Till the time the state gives us a green signal, we can only plan, but cannot put them into action. We have identified the halls where we will make the candidates sit maintaining distance,” said Richard Gasper, principal of St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, who is also ICSE convenor of a central Kolkata zone. Raja Mc Ghee, principal of Calcutta Boys’ School said, “We had a meeting with parents for the distribution of report cards and they seemed welcoming of offline exams.” South City International principal John Bagul said he had planned a seat for each of the 74 ISC and 103 ICSE students in the auditorium and two halls. Though students were relieved, some expressed Covid concerns. “One boy infected would send the rest of us into quarantine. A classmate has had Covid twice. What about our vaccines?” asked Sam Anandh J, an ISC candidate from LMB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cisce-schools-await-govt-nod-to-reopen-prepare-for-offline-exams/articleshow/87230397.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Officials have started field visits to clear the misconceptions regarding vaccination as well as to understand the constraints faced by the residents for delaying their inoculation against Covid-19.Both notified and unnotified households in 213 slums are to be covered by the civic body. All the 65 wards were analysed for the vaccination coverage of which the slums were found to have less coverage in vaccinating the adult population. The civic body’s health workers have been reaching out to the slums to convey the importance of getting vaccinated. Officials said that some of the slum dwellers were resisting even the sensitisation drive due to misconceived fear strengthened by the unverified information circulated against vaccination. “Some people believe that getting vaccinated after or before consuming meat will risk their lives. We are using vaccinated people from the same localities as our ambassadors to promote vaccination, the effort yields a desirable result,” a sanitary officer with Trichy Corporation said. The civic body has surveyed Andakondan, Nelson Street, Kannimar Thoppu, Alwarthope and Gandhi market localities to improve the vaccination coverage.In the K Abishekapuram zone, some slums have achieved only around 20% vaccination coverage. While other wards in the zone have far better coverage, officials said that the slums with a poor vaccination ratio are being focused exclusively to increase the vaccination coverage. “We managed to convince a section of those in dilemma over getting the jab. The awareness drive targeting the slums will go on, we are covering the areas based on the study we did,” a senior corporation official said. Some of the workers who have duties even on Sundays have claimed that the timing of the vaccination drive does not sync with their availability. The feedback is being shared with the senior officials to modify the vaccination strategy, location and timing to cover a maximum number of uncovered adults.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/trichy-corporation-to-focus-on-213-slums/articleshow/87231429.cms||Deepak Karthik

He said the Enforcement Directorate was investigating the matter and that facts would come out soon. “I have all the documents. All allegations being made by the opposition are baseless,” Pawar said, showing the documents to the media here on Friday. Pawar further said the auction of Jarandeshwar sugar mill was carried out as per all the rules and regulations. “A central agency is probing the case and the facts will come out. Other state agencies, such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau, CID and an inquiry committee chaired by a judge had already probed these allegations in the past,” Pawar said. He said Jarandeshwar mill was sold to Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd following the Bombay high court’s orders. Pawar explained the sugar factory failed to repay its outstanding dues. The court gave it a year’s time and said it should be put up for sale if it fails to clear its arrears in this period, Pawar said. After the mill failed to pay the outstanding amount, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) floated a tender to which several companies responded, as Guru Commodity Services’ bid of Rs 65.75 crore was the highest, the bank sold the sugar mill to the company, Pawar said. The deputy chief minister claimed that attempts were being made to mislead people by levelling allegations against specific sugar mills. Pawar further listed out 65 sugar mills that were either sold through auctions or given on contract and claimed that some were sold in the range of Rs 3-10 crore, but that “no one was raising this issue”. Asked about BJP leader Chandrakant Patil’s allegations that fuel prices were soaring in the state because of Pawar’s stand against bringing petrol and diesel under GST, the deputy CM said, “If the Centre reduces taxes on fuel, the state government will definitely think about doing the same,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ajit-pawar-dismisses-sugar-mill-allegations-as-baseless/articleshow/87213494.cms||---

The party demanded that the government must ensure that subsidies for cattle purchase and incentives for milk production should be disbursed within a short period. Congress said that while the cost for cattle fodder has increased along with the price of fuels, dairy farmers are paid the same rate for cow and buffalo milk. “Today the middleman or the doctor is deciding which cow the farmer should purchase. And when the cow does not produce milk, the farmer finds himself in debt,” said Congress spokesperson Mahadev Khandekar. “The government prepares schemes for farmers but they don’t implement them on time or they don’t monitor to see if the benefits reach the farmers. The dairy business has become a loss-making venture and today many of them are considering of leaving this enterprise.” Congress said that the BJP government has failed to see if the schemes are implemented and reach the end beneficiaries. Khandekar said that veterinarians and brokers connive and cheat farmers by prompting them to sell young calves and cows for a low price of Rs 15,000 and subsequently sell the same cattle to another farmer for Rs 75,000 and more. “It takes incentives and subsidies at least eight months to one year for disbursal. Today the fodder cost is increasing and today it costs Rs 15,000 to Rs 18000 to feed and sustain one cow per month, but his income from milk production is just about Rs 12,000, so if the farmer has four or five cows, he is forced to sell one of them to feed the other cows,” said Khandekar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/dairy-ryots-struggling-cheated-by-brokers-vets/articleshow/87230932.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: With no word on campus opening, colleges continue online classes||KOLKATA: College students and teachers are getting ready again for yet another session of online classes after the Durga Puja break. The decision by two school boards to conduct exams offline has rekindled hope that a decision on reopening of educational institutes in a graded manner might be taken in the coming weeks, but their immediate gaol is to complete the syllabus on time before semester exams that start by the end of the year. While some colleges have resumed online classes this week, others will be doing it next week. Some are reopening after Kali Puja. “We were hoping to return to our college but that doesn’t seem possible. There is no other option left but to prepare ourselves for another session of online classes. Since the first semester has started late, we have little time to complete our syllabus. So, the priority now is to finish the syllabus,” said Rajib Ghosh, a first-year commerce student of Seth Anandram Jaipuria College. At St Xavier’s College and St Paul’s, online classes will resume next week. “First and third semester classes will start on October 25 for the English department. Online classes for others will also resume soon,”said a faculty member. A college principal who did not wish to be named said the decision by two main school boards to conduct examinations offline has rekindled hope that some decision to reopen colleges and universities might be taken soon. “Thousands of students graduated this year without setting foot on the campus. Students with science subjects did not conduct even basic experiments in the last four semesters before graduating. At least some on-campus activities should be allowed and decision on starting full-fledged offline classes can be taken later,” said the principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/with-no-word-on-campus-opening-colleges-continue-online-classes/articleshow/87230403.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Lucknow||Modi govt schemes showing holistic impact: Smriti Irani||LUCKNOW: Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani on Saturday said the schemes introduced and implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have a holistic impact on the society. Interacting with the NRIs from Uttar Pradesh during virtual ‘NRI Samwad’ organised by UP Videsh Sampark Vibhag, Irani said: “When was building toilets a political agenda? Building toilets for women was not even talked about in the society. Look at its impact on the safety of women. At least 45% cases of molestation and sexual assault on women happened when they went out of their homes to relieve themselves.” She said when the Jan Dhan scheme was launched, many mocked it. “Jab Covid aaya, uska fayda dikha (it was very useful during pandemic).” Similarly, making women the owners and co-owners of houses under the PM Awas Scheme was empowering them, she said. Irani said leadership was about ascertaining challenges of the future and protecting citizens. In response to a query on western media bashing BJP each time there was an incident of crime in UP, she said well thinking Indians in other countries should be brought together to counter the negative narrative. She spoke about the efforts made by the Modi government in education sector. “The entire curriculum has been digitised. During pandemic, no child said he has no access to content,” she said. “Under the PMGDISHA programme, over 2crore women have been made digitally literate and the focus is on making devices affordable,” she added. Talking about textile sector, she said the government always played the role of a facilitator. “In March 2020, we produced no PPE kits. It all came from China. In the next three months, we were the second largest producer of PPE kits,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/irani-modi-govt-schemes-showing-holistic-impact/articleshow/87231439.cms||---

While a large part of the UK carrier strike group is deployed just off the coast of Mumbai, a Type 23 frigate, HMS Richmond, has arrived at Mormugao Port Trust for a port visit after which she will sail off to participate as an adversary in the war games. The HMS Richmond and two Indian naval warships will act as the Red Force, whose mission objective is to sink or cripple the UK’s fifth generation aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. “The design of the objective is still being worked out, but essentially the mission is to ultimately get a constructive kill of the aircraft carrier. And if successful it will be professionally challenging and rewarding if we get it right,” said commander Hugh Botterill while speaking to reporters at MPT. Konkan Shakti is a simulated tri-services war game, and the HMS Richmond will not be using any live missiles or ammunition rounds when it stalks and hunts for the HMS Queen Elizabeth. However, the exercise will help the crew of HMS Queen Elizabeth hone skills to ward off adversaries in hostile waters. UK’s fifth generation aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth recently completed its first deployment where it sailed through the Taiwan Strait, which is part of the contested South China Sea. HMS Richmond also participated in a UN sanctions monitoring and enforcement mission to enforce sanctions imposed on North Korean. The frigate collected evidence of vessels violating United Nations (UN) sanctions enacted against North Korea’s ballistic missile programme and proliferation of nuclear weapons. The short operation was the first occasion since 2019 that a Royal Navy ship has supported UN sanctions monitoring and enforcement activity.Speaking about the passage through the Taiwan straits, Botterill said that the Royal Navy wanted to demonstrate and reinforce the United Nations Convention for Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). “What we subscribe to is the international rules-based community and what HMS Richmond alongside the carrier strike group did was demonstrate our exercising, our rights under UNCLOS,” the commander said. Botterill said that as the UK looks for a greater role in the Indo-Pacific region’s security dynamics, the Royal Navy is keen to ramp up its presence in the area, particularly deployment of its carrier strike group. The British carrier group’s deployment in the Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean Region is the first since 1997. The Royal Navy has also started a permanent forward deployment of two off-shore patrol vessels, the HMS Spey and HMS Tamar in the Indo-Pacific region. The five year deployment aims to bolster Britain’s presence in the region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/eye-on-indo-pacific-indian-uk-navies-in-war-games/articleshow/87230936.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bow Barracks gets healing touch ahead of Christmas||KOLKATA: Century-old Bow Barracks, built as a Garrison Mess, is getting a new look with a fresh coat of paint on its exposed brick façade and long wooden windows. The plumbing and the sewerage network in the enclave located in the heart of the city has also been completely overhauled along with the electrical wiring. Bow Barracks, originally built for World War I soldiers, is home to the Anglo-Indian community but also boasts of strong cross-cultural roots with Muslims, Chinese and Bengali families residing in the neighbourhood. Residents expect the renovation will be complete before Christmas this year and they would be able to celebrate the festival in a new-look Bow Barracks. It is the venue for the longest Christmas celebrations in the city, stretching from December 23 to January 1, followed by hockey and basketball tournaments. “Bow Barracks is sporting a new look after several years. The buildings have been freshly painted and electrical, plumbing and sewerage work has been done. The residents are happy,” said Angela Govindraj, the secretary of the Bow Barracks Residents’ Welfare Association. The renovation and repairs are being carried out by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority. Bow Barracks has 132 flats, most of which are either one- or two-room apartments. The layout of Bow Barracks is influenced from or has similarity with old historic Spanish Colonial town plan where a compact layout — having a main ‘square’ and a city grid — forms the basic aspects of physical planning. It was built in 1918 for the soldiers but they refused to move in. When Kolkata Improvement Trust was expanding Central Avenue and roads leading to it, several displaced Anglo-Indian fam-ilies were rehabilitated in Bow Barracks. “The renovation started in November last year after a gap of almost half a century. The buildings were in a dilapidated condition and the paint on the façade had worn off. Concrete was falling off from several places inside the buildings. The sewerage system was blocked at several places and plumbing was damaged too,” said a KMDA engineer. “We are soon going to start repair of leakages and wear and tear inside the buildings.” Several conservationists had argued that Bow Barracks must be preserved and the traditional urban culture of the central business district must not be disturbed. Local MLA Nayana Bandyopadhyay was happy that the long-standing demand had been fulfilled. “The lack of repairs for decades had made it risky for people to stay. The place has not only been renovated properly but efforts have been made to restore it to its original condition.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bow-barracks-gets-healing-touch-ahead-of-christmas/articleshow/87230409.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||NCB official’s charge of spying untrue: Mumbai cops||MUMBAI: A probe conducted by Mumbai police has revealed there is no truth in the complaint lodged by NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede that he was being spied upon by sleuths from the Oshiwara police station. Wankhede, who is probing the cruise liner drugs seizure case, had on October 11 called on director general of police Sanjay Pandey, saying his movements were being monitored by Oshiwara police during his daily visits to a cemetery where his mother has been buried. In his complaint, Wankhede submitted it had come to his knowledge that two constables from Oshiwara police station, along with unknown persons, had visited the cemetery in the afternoon of October 7 and collected CCTV footage of his visit. Further, Wankhede brought to the notice of the DGP that he had been informed by his sources that a daughter of a senior state cabinet member, NCP’s Nawab Malik, had been trying to gather information about his movements. Subsequently, on October 11, the trustee of the cemetery had informed him that the police officials were asking for DVR (digital video recording) of the cemetery. Wankhede informed the DGP that he had been visiting the cemetery every day before attending office and whenever time permitted, for the past six years. Initially, the trustee conveyed his inability to share the DVR, but as those who were asking were police officials and for the sake of the trust, CCTV footage was provided to them, he said. Wankhede also urged the DGP that the location of the minister’s daughter should be found out from the cell tower. Officials said that following a probe, it has emerged that no police personnel had visited the cemetery on October 7, and they did not procure CCTV footage from the trustees. Further, the policemen mentioned in the complaint stated they did not see Wankhede on October 11 at the cemetery and that they were not aware he goes there every day. The constables further stated that CCTV footage was procured in connection with the theft of an autorickshaw and they were not accompanied by a third person. There had been an attempt to steal a rickshaw on October 7, and it was actualy stolen on October 9, and it was in that connection that the police personnel had visited the cemetery, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-officials-charge-of-being-spied-on-untrue/articleshow/87231772.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Madurai||Bus operators warned against playing songs fuelling clashes||Tirunelveli: The Tirunelveli district police has warned of stringent action against bus operators if songs that are casteist in nature or would spark religious unrest are played in their vehicles. The warning comes in the wake of the recent casteist revenge murders that created unrest and showed the southern districts in poor light. Superintendent of police (SP) of Tirunelveli district N Manivannan told TOI that the warning was issued after complaints of casteist songs played in buses. “Only private bus drivers and conductors indulge in such acts,” he said.Such songs primarily singing praise of a particular caste are played in route buses connecting various rural areas using the thumb drive and other electronic gadgets on the speakers. This has a direct impact on the public, youth and students who travel in the public transport system in large numbers by triggering casteist feelings, the SP said.Manivannan said that private bus operators have been warned to ensure that their crew members refrain from playing casteist songs, dialogues or videos, failing which action will be taken against the owner, driver and conductor at par with action taken against miscreants for indulging in casteist clashes.Communication in this connection was sent to private bus operators. This is part of the series of measures taken by the Tirunelveli district police to restore normalcy by keeping casteist clashes under check, following the turn of events after the murder of Muthu Mano in the Palayamkottai Central Prison and beheadings at Gopalasamudram.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/bus-operators-warned-against-playing-songs-fuelling-clashes/articleshow/87230941.cms||---

One of the injured, Sagar Gavhane (22), fractured his left leg while five others, including two women, escaped with minor injuries. The Wanowrie police on Friday booked the car driver on the charge of rash driving and causing grievous injuries under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act. “We have seized the car and issued notice to the driver under the Criminal Procedure Code, directing him to co-operate with the police during investigation,” said investigation officer Munir Inamdar on Saturday. Gavhane’s friend Harish Darvesh (24), who is also one of the injured, told TOI, “I stopped at Jagtap chowk to meet my friend when a car running at high speed suddenly took a turn and hit three motorcycles and an autorickshaw one after another. The driver lost control of the vehicle and hit me, Gavhane and four others.” Darvesh said, “The impact of the accident was such that all the four vehicles were damaged. Gavhane fractured his left leg. I and four others escaped with minor injuries. We have requested the driver to bear our medical expenses.” Inamdar told TOI, “Around 100-150 people had assembled at the spot after the car hit vehicles and pedestrians, creating commotion in the Wanowrie area. We rushed to the spot after receiving information about the accident, but passers-by had shifted the injured to a private hospital. We then impounded the car.” He said, “The driver, during questioning, told police that the steering of the car suddenly turned left, and the vehicle picked up speed after he suddenly stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake and met with the accident.” “We have not arrested the driver because he was booked under bailable offence.

The letter was signed by doctors from Association of Radiation Oncologists of India (AROI), Society of Emergency Medicine India, South Asian Medical Students Association, and NGOs, like SwitchON Foundation, Greenpeace, Rainforest Alliance, TSHED, Y-East. The doctors appealed for a blanket ban on not only high-decibel firecrackers but all kinds of fireworks, which leave the city’s ambient air irrevocably polluted with heavy metals. In fact, the low-decibel, colourful light-emitting fireworks cause greater air pollution than the firecrackers. However, the current regulation has banned firecrackers beyond 90 decibel, but has allowed low-decibel fireworks. The signatories, under the aegis of SwitchON Foundation, offered support to the administration for generating awareness about pollution among the public. Suman Mallik, vice-president, AROI, said, “The extensive use of firecrackers during Diwali leads to five- to 20-times increase in the air pollutants.” Vinay Jaju of SwitchON Foundation and Convenor of Bengal-CAN said, “We have urged the chief minister to ban firecrackers completely, as was done last year.” Studies show a single-point rise in the level of air pollution can easily push up rise of Covid cases by 6%-7%. Soirindhri Banerjee of Radiation Oncology, IPGMER & SSKM Hospital, said, “It is important to recognise the potential of smoke and suspended smog as significant worsening factors of respiratory infections.” Arup Haldar, consultant pulmonologist, Woodlands Hospitals, said, “More careful approach is warranted from the administrative side to reduce the ambient air pollution in the coming winter. The dual enemies of air pollution and Covid may wreak havoc in the lungs.” Kaustubh Choudhary, consultant paediatrician, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, said, “Last year, due to Covid, there were restrictions. Burning firecrackers was reduced and that helped in the reduction of the dust-related or pollution-related diseases that have led to exaggeration of asthma and respiratory problems for my patients in the past. Now, with the large number of viral-affiliated bronchiolitis cases, if pollution is increased, it can aggravate the core situation. Therefore, possibly, we should have restrictions this time too.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/docs-appeal-to-cm-for-blanket-ban-on-fireworks-this-diwali/articleshow/87230433.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Since March 2020 when the pandemic was declared, the organisation has been conducting programmes online. Sengupta is a member of the innovation club at BITM and was excited to be back and get a hands-on experience about drones. Niladri Saha of Ballygunge Government High School, who also attended the workshop, learned how to built a glider and fly it. Drone expert Arnab Mukherjee taught the students aspects of aero-modelling design and how to make hand gliders. “Many students have tried building gliders, drones, aero-modelling planes and helicopters on their own. One has even made a quadrapod. After being stuck at home for almost two years, they are visibly delighted to be out together trying something exciting. Their inquisitiveness and incisive questions were a treat for us,” said Mukherjee. The programme is being held over the weekend. The students have been split into two batches of 30 each. While the timing for the first batch is 10am to 1pm; the second batch is from 2pm to 5pm. The workshop includes multi-rotor drone assembly, fixed wing glider making, hand glider competition and actual flying of the drone on BITM premises. Drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without any human pilot or passengers on board. The flight of UAV can be operated under remote control or with autopilot assistance. Initially developed for military missions, they have now been extended to non-military applications such as aerial photography, product deliveries, agriculture, policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, and science exploration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kids-learn-to-fly-high-at-bitm-drone-workshop/articleshow/87230416.cms||Subhro Niyogi

However, the post of president in the panchayat was reserved for a dalit woman. Only two dalit women had filed their nominations for the president’s post when the election was held in 2019 as the non-dalits kept off and only thirteen votes were polled. Rajeswari, who secured ten of these votes, was elected panchayat president and assumed charge.However, as no one contested for the six ward member posts in protest as non-dalits announced boycott of the polls, these posts had been remaining vacant for the past two years. In the absence of a proper council, the president was also not able to do much for the village. It was in this backdrop that elections were held to the six ward member posts two weeks ago on October 9. Six ward members including Vaikundaselvi for ward-1, Kesavan, Natarajan, Sujatha, Yagopu and Parimalaselvi for the other wards were elected. All except Parimalaselvi, whose son died, assumed charge on October 20. The vice-president was to be elected from among these six members for which election was scheduled for Friday.Commissioner of Tiruchendur panchayat union Rani, assistant block development officer Balamurugan and panchayat president Rajeswari arrived at the panchayat office and waited for the newly elected members to conduct the elections. However, five of the newly elected, except Parimalaselvi, walked in, handed over their resignation letters and walked out.Tuticorin district collector Dr K Senthil Raj said the resignations has not been accepted. They had informed the State Election Commission about the matter and sought another date for conducting the election to the post of vice-president.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/non-dalit-ward-members-quit-in-reserved-panchayat/articleshow/87230946.cms||---

Though he didn't name anyone, the target of his insinuations wasn’t lost on his supporters, whom he addressed at his Borda residence on Saturday to explain his reasons for embracing TMC. “I thought I would take honourable retirement from politics after this term,” Faleiro said. “But when Goa is getting finished, its environment and economy getting destroyed, can any Goan put a hand on his soul and say he wants to retire? If you want to save Goa and Goans, TMC is the only road available. Don’t trust BJP’s B team.” He charged state Congress functionaries with trying to decimate Congress. “Their only agenda is to be the dalals of BJP,” he said. Referring to the 2017 episode of how Congress failed to form the government, Faleiro charged his detractors with having a hidden agenda to help BJP come to office. “I cried not because I was betrayed, but because people who voted for Congress were betrayed. I suffered for the last four-and-a-half years,” he said. Later, Faleiro told reporters that TMC would not ally with any regional party in Goa, though he said anybody was welcome to join the party. “TMC will fight in all 40 constituencies, so there’s no question of alliance,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-functionaries-bjps-b-team-out-to-finish-goa-ex-navelim-mlalocal-cong-functionaries-are-bjp-dalals-tmc-the-only-way-luizinho/articleshow/87230964.cms||---

But to their dismay, neither did they get the money, nor did any government agency reach out to them confirming the registration. The message read: “Pre-registration for Pradhan Mantri Berozgar Bhatta, a 2021 scheme, is going on under which Rs3,500 every month will be given to all the unemployed. Click the link below to pre-register and fill the form. Application fee: Rs. 0 (FREE). Eligibility: 10th pass. Age: 18 – 40. Last date of registration: September 29, 2021.

In fact, the Union home ministry’s cybercrime coordination centre had warned people in May against such fake messages and sites. The ministry, via Cyber Dost twitter handle, stated that cyber crooks were using the pandemic to their advantage and reaching out to people to register on suspicious websites like the one for ‘Pradhan Mantri Berojgari Bhatta’ scheme. People need to exercise caution and avoid sharing any personal information on such unverified websites. A quick search on social media revealed that Press Information Bureau (PIB) had also warned people against such messages way back in May last year.

Dr Vivek Bose, senior interventional cardiologist at the hospital, and his team planned to use an Indian-made naturally bioresorbable stent for the angioplasty instead of a conventional metal stent which will permanently be left in the body.“A Bioresorbable stent is made of naturally soluble material (PLLA) which disappears completely in two to three years. After dissolving the blockage and dilating the blood vessel, it also does a great job of promoting healing of the lining of the treated blood vessel. It also helps the blood vessel return to its normal state quickly,” said Dr Bose. He said it reduces the dependence of patients on medications to prevent blood clots and it may also be easier to do more treatment like bypass surgery in the same artery if needed. The Meril Life Sciences MeRes 100 BRS is a 100 micron thin stent approved by Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and the European CE. The man who had undergone the angioplasty made full recovery and was discharged two days after treatment.Dr Vivek Bose said more than 25% of young people have high chances of developing cardiovascular disease. Apart from stressful lifestyles and sedentary work, the prevalence of diseases such as diabetes, obesity and high BP is a major cause of the disease among Indian youth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/madurai-hosp-uses-bioresorbable-stent-for-angioplasty/articleshow/87230975.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But now with water flowing in the river, plants in the middle of the bridge are continuing to thrive and it has become a matter of concern. Plants like peepal and tamarind are seen growing more in these crevices,” said Sankarapandian.He had submitted petitions to the authorities and was told to take it up with the PWD. “We did not wait for them to come and do it because the cracks in the walls of the bridges have started to become wider, which is dangerous as the plants keep growing,” they said.The 132 year old AV bridge in Madurai also has some plants growing in it and they plan to remove it in the coming weeks. Madura Coats bridge is another which has plant overgrowth in its crevices. Sometimes people who see them in action come forward to help. “They ask us what we are doing and we tell them the importance of at least reporting such things to the authorities for action,” said Sankarapandian.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/youths-keep-bridges-safe-by-clearing-overgrowth/articleshow/87230968.cms||---

Cops had recovered Rs1.74 crore cash from Mankar, which — said police superintendent (SP) Dr Dilip Patil Bhujbal — has been deposited in the district treasury. The court has been informed accordingly, Bhujbal added. The SP said police has brought the cash haul to I-T department’s notice. “We have asked them to call the doctor to explain how he amassed such a huge amount,” Bhujbal said, adding that the doctor should disclose the source of his income. Bhujbal further said that the doctor would be given the money only after he satisfies the investigation officer and the I-T officials. “The legal process has to be followed before refund is granted,” the SP added. Meanwhile, the doctor has moved an application in Yavatmal court for the return of the amount seized by the cops from honeytrap mastermind Mankar at Arunodaya Society. Mankar died by suicide in a flat off Darwha Road on Thursday night. The 22-year-old was released on bail and staying with his relative after being nabbed by the cyber cell of Yavatmal police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/honeytrap-case-delhi-doc-under-i-t-radar/articleshow/87230459.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Ambawadi firm accuses executive of embezzling Rs 15 lakh||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat University police registered a complaint of criminal breach of trust and cheating on Saturday, filed by Jindal Wildlife Limited, Ambawadi, against one of its employees. The complainant alleged that sometime between January 2020 and June 8, 2021, one Hardik Pandya who worked as a senior executive in the credit control department of the company, had embezzled Rs 15.36 lakh of the company’s money. According to the complaint filed by Bhavik Modi, 28, the legal officer of Jindal Wildlife, Pandya was in charge of recovering dues and pending payments on behalf of the company. Pandya, a resident of Ghatlodia, allegedly abused his position and made off with the company’s money which he collected from dealers but didn’t deposit in the company’s account. The complainant stated that Pandya didn’t report to his superior Anil Sharma the details of the collections, and when Sharma pressed, Pandya stopped coming to the company. Sharma then contacted other firms and found Pandya had deposited Rs 9.92 lakh collected from various firms in his personal account. Also, in another case a company in Ratanpole had paid Rs 5.44 lakh in various instalment and Pandya, instead of depositing this amount to the company account, had deposited the same in his personal account. Thus, according to the complaint, he had cheated the company of Rs 15.36 lakh in total. The GU police have registered the complaint against Pandya under IPC Section 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ambawadi-firm-accuses-executive-of-embezzling-rs-15l/articleshow/87230466.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: In seven years, 56 lives lost on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass||PUNE: Friday night’s accident in which two persons died and 12 were injured was just the latest in a series of accidents on a dangerous stretch of the Katraj-Dehu Road Bypass, which claimed the lives of 56 people over the past seven years. In the wake of Friday’s deadly crash that involved a tanker, a mini bus and several other vehicles, the Sinhagad Road police, and officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Saturday took a review of the accident-prone spots, especially between Bhumkar Chowk and Navale Bridge on the bypass. Friday’s crash occurred a day after two women were killed while five others suffered grievous wounds after a speeding truck rammed a slow-moving pickup truck, which collided with three motorcycles near Narhe selfie point. These were among 46 fatal accidents over the past seven years. “We conducted a study of the 3.5km stretch between Swami Narayan Temple and Vadgaon bridge. We found that since 2014, there were a total 46 fatal accidents on this stretch in which 56 people died,” senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of the Sinhagad Road police station said. Police on Saturday suggested several measures to NHAI to avert accidents. “We suggested removing the selfie point at Narhe where accident occurred on Thursday. People park their vehicles on the bypass and visit the selfie point. This is causing traffic congestions and accidents,” Gheware said. Police also told NHAI to maintain the shoulders of the highway properly and to install crash barriers. However, NHAI authorities blamed the accidents on lane-cutting and speeding by heavy vehicles. “We make announcements at the Khed-Shivapur toll plaza, urging truck and bus drivers to maintain lane discipline and not to speed on the slope,” an NHAI official said, adding that these entreaties were constantly ignored.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/in-seven-years-56-lives-lost-on-katraj-dehu-road-bypass/articleshow/87230465.cms||---

The Rs 200 crore scheme by the Tamil Nadu school education department aims to help bridge the learning gap for students of classes I to VIII.The awareness campaign for the pilot project was launched recently in Madurai and seven other districts. Efforts are on at the district-level to plan its implementation and also rope in volunteers. “Under the scheme, after school hours in the evening, two-hour classes will be conducted by volunteers to engage students between classes I to VIII. It will be held in batches such that one volunteer handles not more than 20 students. Currently, we are holding awareness programmes to recruit volunteers,” said an education department official. Volunteers can register online on https://illamthedikalvi.tnschools.gov.in/Welcome and register themselves. “Volunteers will only be selected for the programme after they are scrutinized and reviewed. Anyone who has a minimum qualification of clearing Class XII is eligible, including young graduates,” said the official. A district-level awareness event and meeting with all education department officials, teacher co-ordinators, welfare activists and educationists will be held on Monday.Though the scheme aims to help children get a chance to to pick up what they missed due to being out of school, government school teachers expressed concerns over quality of teaching. “It is still a welcome initiative, but care should be exercised while bringing in volunteers. Volunteers are not professional teachers and may also have no experience teaching previously,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/search-on-for-volunteers-to-lead-education-at-doorstep-scheme/articleshow/87230985.cms||---

---||Goa||BJP will drop Sawant ahead of polls: AAP||Panaji: AAP said on Saturday that BJP has prepared a 10-point list of CM Pramod Sawant’s failures, and is all set to drop him from the post and appoint a new CM ahead of the state assembly elections. Addressing a press conference in the capital, Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that BJP hopes to soothe the public anger and the disgruntled karyakartas of the saffron party by replacing Sawant with a senior party member. “We have heard from really good sources that the BJP is going to change its CM in Goa barely two months ahead of the elections. Pramod Sawant will be dropped and a new chief minister will be appointed,” said Sisodia. “BJP has understood that Goa is upset, angry with Pramod Sawant because he and his government did not do anything good for the state. They know that it will be difficult to go for the elections with him. BJP will now present a new face for the elections,” said Sisodia. AAP said that the government’s mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic tops the list of complaints against Sawant. “The first is that Pramod Sawant failed to handle Covid-19. We all saw how everything from oxygen and beds to ambulances were also short. Covid-19 spread so rapidly, there was mismanagement to the extent that the positivity rate reached 50%, which was the highest in the country,” said Sisodia. Sisodia said that the conflict between the CM and the health minister has always been out in the open, and when things went out of hand, Union home minister Amit Shah had to intervene. AAP has also said that the labour department scam, delay in the Covid-19 relief disbursement, failure to hike wages of Covid health workers by 20% and the unemployment crisis in Goa are the other factors going against Sawant. AAP also claimed that the “disaster mismanagement” during cyclone Tauktae, failure to restart mining operations and deteriorating law and order in the state has left the BJP facing a strong anti-incumbancy wave. “The education sector is so bad that government schools are being shut and students are climbing trees and hills to get network for online classes. The power and water tariffs are so high,” said Sisodia. “The BJP has accepted that its chief minister has done nothing but no matter what they do, the BJP can’t change the mood of the people just two months before the elections.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bjp-will-drop-sawant-ahead-of-polls-aap/articleshow/87230993.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||At 23, man allegedly stole Rs 40, acquitted after turning 65 this year||NAGPUR: Over 42 years after a man, then 23, allegedly stole Rs 40 by injuring a person, the sessions court here has acquitted him from the charges of robbery recently. During pendency of the over four decades old case, his three accomplices in the crime as well as the complainant and four of the seven witnesses have expired. The accused, Bhimrao Nitnaware, who turned 65 years old this year, along with co-accused — Ramesh Meshram, Madhukar Patil and Hiraman Dhoke – had allegedly attacked complainant Motiram at around midnight opposite the wireless station in Hingna on January 13, 1978. After injuring Motiram, they robbed him of Rs40 which he had earned after selling milk. After Motiram lodged a complaint with MIDC police station, Meshram was arrested but the other three accused remained absconding for many years. The police had filed a charge-sheet against all the four accused under Section 394 of IPC for dacoity. Subsequently, the trial started before the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC). It was later realized that the accused had also attacked the complaint with a knife and, therefore, the charges were reframed under Section 398 of IPC which is for attempting to commit robbery armed with a deadly weapon. The case was transferred to the sessions court for a fresh trial after a new charge was added. In the meanwhile, the absconding accused were nabbed by the police but were granted bail. According to Nitnaware’s counsel, Amit Band, the case did not come up for listing after a few hearings and was forgotten. “It was only after the Bombay High Court’s directives to retrieve pending old cases that it was taken up on priority and and trial restarted in 2019 after over four decades. By that time, four of the seven witnesses were already dead while two were untraceable. Three accused and the complaint too had expired during the pendency,” said Band. “In the instant case, apparently, the incident took place in the year 1978. Since then, almost 42 years have passed. The age of those witnesses who have been reported dead was between 35 and 45 years during the incident. Naturally, the prosecution could not produce those witnesses, as they are no more,” said additional sessions judge PY Ladekar before acquitting the accused. He pointed out that the only evidence which can be considered is that the spot panchnama as mentioned in the charge sheet and the seizure memo that indicates that blood-stained clothes of the injured were seized. “Even if the accused has admitted these two documents, they do not take the prosecution case anywhere in proving the ingredients of the offence. Since the charges are not proved, the accused will have to be acquitted,” the judge said before asking Nitnaware to execute a Rs5,000 PR bond for his release.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/at-23-man-allegedly-stole-rs40-acquitted-after-turning-65-this-yr/articleshow/87230480.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation to reopen quarantine units and safe homes||KOLKATA: Safe houses and quarantine centres will be reopened by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). A decision has also been taken to keep its fleet of ambulances and hearse vans ready in the wake of a steady rise in Covid cases in the city. The civic brass on Friday held an urgent meeting to chalk out a strategy to check a spread in transmission. The civic authorities decided to resume its sanitization drive across the city. For now, the KMC has decided to reopen a quarantine centre at Champamoni maternity home and two safe houses — one at a commercial building located near Science City and another at Cossipore. The makeshift safe home at Cossipore will give shelter to infected children and their mothers. According to a KMC health department official, special attention was being paid to the health of children in a locality where there is a rise in Covid cases. “Though the infection rate among children is not yet high, we can’t take chances. We have asked our tele-callers to take note of the condition of children in a household where one or more members have tested positive for Covid,” said a civic health official. According to a civic source, the KMC health department may also convert Uttirno, a state government owned building at Alipore, into a safe house for children and their mothers. This apart, the KMC will intensify its Covid tests at the urban primary health clinics. According to a KMC medical officer, majority of the citizens who are testing positive belong to an asymptomatic group. “This trend calls for more people to go for RT-PCR tests for which we collect swabs from 33 urban primary health centres across the city,” the medical officer said. Currently not more than 20 people are queuing up at the KMC swab collection centres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-to-reopen-quarantine-units-and-safe-homes/articleshow/87230483.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||‘Vital installations in Haryana have to be razed to apply forest order’||NEW DELHI: In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the Haryana government has said thousands of structures, including strategic installations such as air force stations, CRPF and ITBP complexes, the NSG campus, the entire IMT at Manesar, Bhondsi jail and Gurgaon’s mini-secretariat, besides hundreds of government and corporate offices, will have to be demolished if the Haryana government strictly implements the court’s orders to treat land notified under Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) as forest. The PLPA is the law that protects large tracts of the Aravalis, primarily the foothills. The state has claimed that the entire area of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Palwal and eight other districts have been notified under different sections of the PLPA, which was enacted in 1900 to prevent soil erosion and not to include forest and protected areas in its ambit. The additional affidavit from the Haryana government, which has been filed in an ongoing hearing to clear forest land of encroachment at Khori village in Faridabad, has surprised activists and former forest officers of the state who have been opposing its move to take out massive tracts of Aravalis from the scope of the PLPA. The apex court had on October 5 directed the state government to submit a factual account of how the area in question was notified as forest area. R P Balwan, former conservator of forest and an ex-member of a committee formed by the Supreme Court-appointed central empowered committee (CEC) for delineation of Aravalis, told TOI the state was misleading the court. “The state government is trying to create fear by trying to portray that the entire area in 11 districts is forest. This is wrong. Out of the total 44.21 lakh hectares of land in Haryana, only 31,278 hectares have been closed under Section 4 and 5 of PLPA as forest. In Gurgaon, 6,821 hectares and in Faridabad, 561 hectares have been notified under these sections. The entire Gurgaon, major parts of Faridabad and other districts have been notified under Section 4 under ‘general order’, which specifies that tree-felling is not allowed without prior permission,” Balwan said. For a long time, there was an internal tussle between the Haryana forest and revenue departments over which land parcels can be treated as “forest”. The Supreme Court, in an earlier order, had gone by the records submitted by the forest department while upholding that all areas identified by it as “forest” should be no-go zone for non-forestry activity. But the state government has now argued that the issue of declaration of land under sections 4 & 5 of PLPA or forest should be decided based on records maintained by the revenue department. It has said, “..merely because the forest department exercised certain degree of regulatory control over the said land due to administrative exigencies, the same would not automatically clothe the status of such land as ‘ forest’ in any statute of enactment or through judicial mandamus”. The affidavit said no land notified under sections 4 & 5 of the PLPA has been recorded as forest land in revenue records. The state has also said the purpose of notifying this land under PLPA was to conserve and restore soil and should be applicable for a limited period. “Intention of PLPA has never been to create or convert notified land into forest land in any manner. The closure or prohibition that is sought to be enforced as a temporary measure solely as a measure to regulate, restrict or prohibit certain activities during the period of such closure which is lifted upon the expiry of the said period,” the state has argued. The Haryana government in 2019 amended the PLPA to allow construction and also to protect previous constructions, including in sections of the ecologically sensitive Aravalis, but the apex court stayed the decision, slamming it as “willful adventurism" that violates the court’s previous orders. The court had said the Haryana government’s action was “obnoxious and contemptuous” and expressed annoyance at its “temerity” to violate its order that banned mining and construction activities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/vital-installations-have-to-be-razed-to-apply-forest-order/articleshow/87231493.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Nagpur||‘Collaborative efforts needed to save wetlands in NNTR corridor’||Mahendra Bhojram Raut (33) is a wildlife biologist working as a field officer in the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) corridor since the last decade under the Central India Tiger Corridor Securement Project being implemented by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). Last week, Raut was awarded a doctorate by Nagpur University for his distinct study on ‘Status, threats and conservation measures of wetland avifauna in the NNTR corridor in the eastern Vidarbha landscape’. Raut, who lives in Malijunga, on the fringes of Nagzira, conducted the work under the guidance of CJ Khune, head, PG department of zoology, MB Patel College, Sakoli. In an interview to TOI, Raut talks about the reasons behind water bodies in the corridor and how they have shrunk by over 78sqkm in the last 20 years. Excerpts… Q. Why did you choose wetlands in the NNTR corridor as your topic? A. I’ve been working in the region for a decade and know how important a role these wetlands play in the corridor connecting two global priority tiger landscapes — Kanha and Tadoba in Central India. Strategically, NNTR is in the heart of the Central India tiger landscape which contributes almost one-sixth of the total tiger population of India. However, the 78.41sqkm water spread area has been reduced in the last two decades raising concerns. Hence, I chose this topic to provide valuable information on the ecological health and status of wetlands. Q. How did you cover the wetlands? A. The NNTR corridor covers an area of about 620sqkm distributed in three tehsils of Sadak Arjuni, Deori and Goregaon in Gondia district. The corridor was divided into five blocks and one perennial lake was selected from each block. The lakes included Putli, Naktya, Umarzari, Rengepar, and Chulbandh. Three different sites of each lake were selected for periodical sampling to study physicochemical and biological parameters. The study of wetland avifauna, fish and aquatic plants was carried out on a monthly basis in different seasons during the entire study period. There are 71 non-perennial lakes in the NNTR corridor. I studied 5 perennial lakes. Q. What role do these wetlands play for wildlife and people? A. These wetlands are ecosystem management functionaries. For example, flood mitigation, storm abetment, aesthetic and subsistence etc. In natural conditions, these wetlands store floodwater temporarily and protect downstream areas from flash floods. They have tremendous ability to meet the water requirement in the villages surrounding NNTR. Fisheries continue to provide a vital source of food, employment and income to thousands in the NNTR corridor. Wetlands are sources of drinking water and feeding ground for the animals living around them and for their movement from one protected area to another. These wetlands have supported villages in developing agriculture, water systems and fishing. These also help in the dispersal and movement of wild animals for food, water, fodder, shelter, breeding etc. Q. Over 78sqkm of wetlands have vanished in the NNTR corridor. A. I’m not saying this. A GIS study by PK Yadav and others from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Dwarka, revealed this fact in 2012 and this is one of the reasons why I decided to take it further. No doubt water bodies have been decreasing continuously. This degradation is due to anthropogenic activities, encroachments for agriculture and the fast spread of invasive plant species like Ipomoea carnea. Also, maximum deforestation has occurred in the corridor in the last two decades. Over 1.81% of dense forests have been converted into an open forest and 2.21% of the open forest has turned into barren land. If deforestation and degradation of wetlands continue, it will affect water birds, fishes and aquatic plants and the entire wetland biodiversity which is significant for the movement of wildlife through these corridors in Central India. Q. Is the state government taking steps to conserve these wetlands? A. The government and local institutions need collaborative efforts to conserve these freshwater resources. As wetland catchment areas are in the forest, the department’s role is crucial because whatever development plans are being implemented under its jurisdiction, it has a direct impact on the wetlands. The fisheries and agriculture departments also need to play an important role as they are in direct contact with the fishing cooperatives and farmers. There is an urgent need for collaborative conservation efforts by politicians, local institutions, government departments and NGOs to conserve these wetlands in the NNTR corridor. It will be great if decision-makers declare some select areas in the NNTR corridor as important bird areas (IBAs). Q. Does your study include natural as well as human-induced gains and losses? A. 89 villages located in the corridor are directly dependent on these wetland resources for fish, water for agriculture and other benefits. So, the success of reconnecting people with their ecosystem lies within the people themselves and their empowerment. They must feel a sense of ownership of conservation or restoration sites as every conservation policy is community-driven. Q. What are the major findings of the study? A. My study has revealed that 59 species of wetland birds belonging to 30 families, 70 species of aquatic plants belonging to 37 families and the occurrence of 62 fish species belonging to 18 families were recorded from these five lakes. The analysis of data on the residential status revealed that out of 59 bird species, 41 species were residents. Majority of the birds (93%) of the species were classified as ‘least concern’ followed by 3.5% each were ‘vulnerable’ and ‘near threatened’ as per the criterion of the IUCN red list. Bird diversity was maximum at the Rengepar Lake and minimum at Naktya Lake. More aquatic plants and fish species in a lake support more bird diversity. A wide stretch of agricultural fields skirting the wetlands along with native trees provide additional food to birds in the form of seeds, tree fruits, bees and animal feeds. Q. Is climate change affecting these wetlands? A. Obviously, climate change has affected these lakes to a great extent. An increase in floods, drought, high heat days and severe storms frequency have affected wetlands in the NNTR corridor. Freshwater biodiversity is vulnerable to such changes in hydrology as they exist between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. All stakeholders should have a participative approach in planning, implementation and evaluating the restoration work as equals. A network for long-term monitoring sites needs to be established to keep track of the wetlands status throughout the region. Q. Why have thousands of migratory birds stopped visiting these lakes? A. The basic requirement of migratory birds at their wintering ground is adequate food and safety which is fulfilled by these wetlands as these are situated near fertile agricultural fields. However, overproduction of fishes with fast-growing herbaceous fish species was introduced by the fisheries department in open lakes. Invasive and herbaceous fishes destroyed vegetation and affected freshwater biodiversity. Fast-growing ipomoea carnea is also a major threat to all the required aquatic plants in the lakes in the NNTR corridor. Q. How will your study help protect these wetlands? A. The outcome of the study can help prepare a management plan for sustainable wetland resource use and biodiversity protection. Quantitative baseline data of the five perennial lakes in the corridor is available now and it will help conservation practitioners. It will be a great step if the government and NGOs with the collaboration of locals and educational institutions work to explore and conserve these wetlands for the survival of wildlife and humans too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/collaborative-efforts-needed-to-save-wetlands-in-nntr-corridor/articleshow/87230487.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

While Nafisa died outside her house after being attacked by her relatives with sticks and sharp weapons, her father Sabir Ali succumbed to injuries in SMS Hospital. Police said both sons of Sabir are undergoing treatment, while two more relatives are also admitted in the hospital. According to relatives and police, the scuffle took place among members of a joint family who lived in different portions of the same house. “There is a small drain at the common gate of their house. Sabir ran a small engine oil shop adjacent to the house and had sealed the drain with cement. Other relatives objected to it. There was simmering tension in the joint family for a long time because of which they had filed cross complaints against each other at Lal Kothi police station recently. We had also detained a few persons in the case,” said police. Sabir’s brother Kannu Khan alleged that the accused used sharp objects to kill his sibling. Several local residents and shopkeepers had gathered outside the deceased’s house. Neighbours claimed that they first heard cries from the house. When they came out, they saw about a dozen people clashing with each other on Ghat Gate road. Lal Kothi police said the deceased’s two sons, Shakir and Sajid, are undergoing treatment in the hospital. “Two persons from the other family were also admitted to the hospital. Their condition is stable,” the official added. “Tensions began around 11.30am. They fought with each other over a petty dispute. But we are investigating the entire case to see if there were other reasons involved too,” the official told TOI, adding that arrests will be made soon. The victim’s family members filed a complaint at Lal Kothi police station. The bodies of the father and daughter were shifted to SMS Hospital mortuary for post-mortem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/dispute-over-drain-claims-lives-of-man-daughter-in-city/articleshow/87230996.cms||---

This has been revealed by the state government in response to a Right To Information (RTI) application filed by Vala Hardevbhai Himjibhai of Trapaj village in Talaja taluka of Bhavnagar district. Of these, 3,324 vacancies are for mathematics teachers and 3,087 for social studies teachers from Class 1 to Class 8. For Class 1 to Class 5 there are 5,687 vacancies and in the case of Class 6 to Class 8, there are 8,237 positions that were vacant till August 31, according to the government response to the RTI plea. Hitting out at the state government, Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “There are as many as 50,000 young men and women who have passed the TAT and have been waiting for four years to get jobs of schoolteachers. How will students learn if there is such a large shortage of teachers?” Questioning the government’s development model, Doshi said that while the education of students suffers, the government is not doing anything for the large number of qualified candidates who are unemployed for the last four years after clearing TAT. The TAT examination is conducted by the state examination board every year. The validity of the exam certificates is for five years in Gujarat. The examinations are a mandatory requirement for all who wish to apply for teaching positions and jobs of principals in government and grant-in aid schools. A large number of schools are in rural areas and the shortage of teachers will eventually lead to their closure, Doshi said. Also, the level of education has deteriorated in the state over the years as teachers are entrusted with more than 60 non-teaching activities, Doshi claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-schools-short-of-14k-teachers/articleshow/87230490.cms||---

The protest would also be held at different project sites in the state from where the people are displaced. Around 300 representatives from Congress, RJD, CPM, CPI-ML, Marxist Coordination Committee and displaced person’s organisations took the decision to hold the protest at a meeting held at the social development centre hall here on Saturday. The meeting was held to highlight the problems faced by people displaced by various public and private sector projects. While addressing the meeting, former MP and CPI state secretary, Bhuneshwar Prasad Mehta, said displacement has become a curse for the state and that around one crore people have been directly and indirectly affected by it. He claimed that several lakhs of displaced persons have now become traceless. Mehta demanded that the state government forms a commission for the displaced persons to resolve their problems. He further said neither the central government nor the state government has implemented the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 because of which the companies are acquiring land from farmers at a cheap rate so far. Taking part in the meeting, senior trade Union leader Lakhan Mahto said in coal-bearing areas, the Act is not in the interest of landowners and should be withdrawn. He pointed out that there is no time limitation for utilization of land acquired for various projects in the Act and it does not provide for the rehabilitation of the land losers. The meeting was attended by a large number of representatives from the displaced people’s organisations from different parts of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/pol-parties-displaced-peoples-groups-to-hold-protest-march-on-nov-7/articleshow/87230638.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The NMC has made it clear that no further extension will be granted, said sources in the transport department. Sources said that as per the agreement, the firm was supposed to deliver the e-buses in two lots but it has already delayed the delivery. TOI tried to contact representatives of the e-bus manufacturing unit but did not get any response. Sources said that the firm is under pressure to deliver e-buses to Pune and Mumbai cities that have placed bigger orders. Delivery of the first lot of 25 buses – as per letter of acceptance (LOA) by the firm – should have been made on September 20. “As per LOA, the second lot of 15 buses is supposed to be delivered by November 19,” a senior official from the transport department said. In a letter to the firm, the NMC’s transport manager and deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Bhelave pointed out that the first lot of 25 buses should have been delivered by 390 days from the date of LOA. For the remaining 15 buses, the time period was 450 days. The BJP-ruled NMC had refused to accept 100 electric buses being sponsored by the department of heavy industries and public enterprises, owing to its precarious financial condition. Instead it decided to procure only 40 buses under Phase-II of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle). So far, the NMC has received Rs 3.60 crore (of the Rs 18 crore) as it had shortlisted 40 midi e-buses and is receiving Rs45 lakh subsidy for each bus. The NMC will get second and third instalments of Rs7.2 crore each after all 40 e-buses are inducted. The midi bus procured from the firm costs around Rs1.49 crore each and the cost of procuring all e-buses comes to around Rs 60 crore. The NMC has signed a MoU with the firm to operate the buses. To a query, official sources said NMC has also identified a depot at Khapri. The firm will develop infrastructure, including 20 charging stations. After 10 years on build and operate basis, the facility will be transferred to NMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nmc-asks-hyd-firm-to-deliver-40-e-buses-by-nov-15/articleshow/87230508.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Ranchi||West Singhbhum admin launches awareness drive after 5 die of diarrhoea||Jamshedpur: On discovering that the conventional practice among villagers to approach exorcist to get cured from vector-borne diseases is leading to delay in diarrhoea cases getting reported and people losing lives, West Singhbhum administration has launched educative programme to make the villagers aware. Deputy Commissioner Ananya Mittal has instructed social welfare officials at the block and panchayat level to conduct awareness campaigns in the villages, particularly affected ones, to enlighten villagers and check exorcism-linked treatment of the diseases. "Apart from the educative part, swastha sahiyas have been asked to report suspected cases of vector-borne diseases to the block medical teams for immediate intervention," said Mittal. The official added that jal sahiyas have been asked to make sure villagers use clean water/boiled water for drinking and cooking purposes. Besides, cleaning of the overhead tanks in every household has been launched in an extensive way, Mittal said. The administration is taking multiple measures to contain the spread of diarrhoea after five villagers died of the disease out of the 14 confirmed cases reported from the 18 different villages in the past five weeks. An IDSP (Integrates Disease Surveillance Programme) official in the district told TOI that technically five deaths qualified as diarrhoea casualties. "Seven other cases had symptoms of diarrhoea but cause of the death was not the same hence they don't qualify to be declared as diarrhoea deaths," said the IDSP official requesting anonymity. The district health department is conducting camps in affected villages in the Sonua, Jagannathpur and Tonto blocks particularly, as overwhelming cases reported from these blocks, and doing health check up of the villagers. Health officials have suggested that monsoon induced factors is the primary cause of the outbreak of diarrhoea in the district. The villages that lack safe water are the ones that have reported chunk of vector-borne disease cases, added the IDSP official. People living in the remote villages in the dense forest areas are dependent on the available water bodies for sourcing water in the district. "According to Sustainable Development Goals Index 2021, Jharkhand is one of the weakest performers where prevalence of pneumococcal and diarrhoeal infections is common particularly among the children," said Sangita Patel, Director, Health Office, USAID. Funded by USAID, NISHTHA, a health system strengthening project, is being implemented in Jharkhand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/west-singhbhum-admin-launches-awareness-drive-after-5-die-of-diarrhoea/articleshow/87230625.cms||---

The centralised portal will not only provide services but it will also help in monitoring and timely delivery of citizen services to improve urban governance. The centralised portal will be a part of the proposed National Urban Digital Mission and will be implemented in the state through state urban development department. The planning was discussed during a meeting of the state urban development department officials along with a visiting four-member delegation headed by Director of the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) Hitesh Vaidya. The delegation held discussions about current reforms and initiatives which are being implemented in the state and said that many of the ideas implemented in the state will also be incorporated as part of the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM). NUDM is being anchored by NIUA which was launched by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs along with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for improving ease of living for citizens and facilitate electronic delivery of municipal services across all 4,400+ ULBs of the country. Talking to TOI, Director of the State Urban Development Authority (SUDA) Amit Kumar said: “We have citizen centric services like issuance of birth/death certificate, building plan approval, property tax collection, issuing trade licence among others which are being done online. But it is being done by respective ULBs and they are working in isolation. However, when we will have a central portal which will have dynamic database with service delivery options using technological interventions, it will help us in real time monitoring as well as in clearing backlogs of services.” Adding further, Kumar said: “For example, if all ULBs in the state are connected with a central portal and we can ascertain how many water connections have been provided and what is the current backlog and the reasons behind it with a click. It will also help us in monitoring pending work and can take remedial actions for clearing tahe backlogs.” Vaidya who also visited control and command centre on Ranchi smart city campus said that the practices in state is appreciable and the integration of all citizen centric services will be a boon to people living in urban areas. “The surveillance centre in Ranchi smart city is world class and this model can be taken up for replication in other states too,” said Vaidya. Officials of the state urban development department requested the visiting team to incorporate a real time monitoring system for solid waste management so that collection to disposal of solid waste generated in urban areas can be monitored in a real time basis at all ULBs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/urban-amenities-to-be-brought-on-digital-monitoring-platform/articleshow/87230721.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||NTPC’s second coal mining project in Hazaribag to start operations soon||Ranchi: At a time when coal shortage and crisis of fuel to fire thermal power stations was making headlines, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in Jharkhand was busy clearing decks for operationalising its second captive coal mine in Hazaribag. It awarded the Mine Developer-cum-Operator (MDO) contract for Chatti-Bariatu coal mine — second in Hazaribag to M/s Rithwik-AMR consortium on October 2 and held its first meeting with the service providers at the NTPC headquarters in Ranchi on Wednesday to kick start the project. Prior to Chatti Bariatu, NTPC has been mining coal from Punkri-Burwadih coal mines with M/s Thriveni Earthmovers and Sainik Mining as the MDO in the same region to feed its thermal power plants across the country. The Punkri-Burwadih mines has an annual capacity of around 15 million metric tonnes. An official release from the thermal power major stated that the new mine of 7 million metric tone annual capacity would augment their coal producing capacity. The Chatti-Bariatu coal mine was re-allocated to the NTPC in 2015 but it was lying unused all these years. The coal from this mine would be used to feed NTPC’s plant in Barh in Bihar. “During the meeting with MDO, activities to be taken up and the timelines were discussed. NTPC stressed upon the start of coal production from Chatti -Bariatu mine in FY 2021-22 so that NTPC can augment coal supply to the power stations which will ensure uninterrupted power supply to its customers,” an official communique issued by the NTPC read. The thermal power officials expressed confidence that the villagers, local administration and the state government would extend cooperation in beginning the mining activity. While land acquisition process is in advance stage, the NTPC management is hopeful of completing the remaining formalities soon. “It was because of the cooperation of the villagers and support provided by the local administration under guidance of the state government that coal dispatch from Banadag railway siding area could resume from October 10, earlier this month which was otherwise disrupted due to local protests,” an official of the NTPC said. NTPC has four mines in Hazaribag. After Chatti Baraitu becoming operational they would still have Keredari and Badam projects in which the process of land acquisition is underway. The supply of coal from NTPC captive coal mining projects is crucial for its power stations for maintaining uninterrupted generation and supply of power.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/ntpcs-second-coal-mining-project-in-hazaribag-to-start-operations-soon/articleshow/87230674.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand Cong eyes grassroots revival with panchayat polls||Ranchi: Jharkhand Congress, which is part of the ruling coalition government in the state, has set its eye on the upcoming panchayat polls to use it as an opportunity to strengthen its cadre at the grassroots but with a larger goal of wheeling a tempo to improve its performance in 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly polls. In 2019 parliamentary polls, the party had a disastrous outing in the state as it could win only one seat, while its ally, JMM, pocketed another in Santhal Pargana. Rest all 12 went to BJP-AJSU-P combined. It, however, managed to win 16 seats in assembly polls which were fought in alliance with JMM and RJD to overthrow BJP-led government. Following the change of guard in the state party leadership, incumbent president Rajesh Thakur has now tasked his four other co-working presidents to marshal resources at the grassroots in their respective regions to overhaul the party. Singhbhum MP Geeta Kora is in charge of Ranchi, Dhanbad, Bokaro, East Singhbhum, Latehar and Jamtara. Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey is appointed to oversee affairs in Gumla, Lohardaga, Simdega, Khunti, West Singbhum and Dumka. Jaleshwar Mahto will take care of Ramgarh, Hazaribag, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Deoghar, Sahebganj and Godda districts. Shahzada Anwar will handle Palamu, Garhwa, Chatra, Giridih, Pakur and Koderma. Talking to TOI on Saturday, Thakur said that the party has distributed areas to respective co-working presidents keeping the social engineering in mind. “The party is in overhaul phase now and beginning with the panchayat polls, which are expected to be announced soon, the Congress aims to emerge as a strong player for 2024 polls. Nationally too, we are on revival mode to oust the BJP-led government from the Centre,” he said. Replying to another question over non-formation of a common minimum programme for smooth functioning of alliance government, Thakur said, "It will happen by next month." Congress insiders maintained that the party being in power must utilise it to strengthen its base by making inroads among people through the good works done by the current government. Even though Opposition BJP has constantly been lashing out on the state government for growing ‘lawlessness’, unemployment, corruption and lack of any visible signs of progress on the ground since Soren government came to power around two years back, the ruling regime claims to have done many landmark works in the short period. “We promised loan waivers, which we implemented. We promised to fight for sarna code in our manifesto, and we got a resolution passed in its favour from assembly. Sports persons have started getting direct jobs and government is gearing up for filling all the remaining vacancies. JPSC (civil services) exams which were pending for years were held collectively for four years recently. The list is unending despite the pandemic,” said another leader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jharkhand-cong-eyes-grassroots-revival-with-panchayat-polls/articleshow/87230597.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The samples which tested positive were of passengers who had arrived in the state capital from other states on trains. However, the administration has not been able to track the infected patients and get them in isolation centres. According to official figures, samples of 1,508 passengers who had arrived in Hatia in the last two days were collected of which 754 were tested by Rapid Antigen Testing Kits, while 754 through RT-PCR. State Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) officials said that they detected a total of 40 cases across the state on Friday and 55 at Hatia station on Saturday and the district administration has been directed to track positive patients immediately and shift them to the nearest isolation centre. “As per my information, 55 samples which were collected at Hatia railway station tested positive and we have asked the local administration to track them down at the earliest and get their primary contacts tested immediately,” said state IDSP chief Dr V B Prasad. However, when TOI contacted Covid-19 hospitals in the city, only two patients were admitted there. Ranchi SDO Deepak Dubey didn’t respond to calls. A senior official, on condition of anonymity, said that they are collecting the personal information related to those who had tested positive and they will be shifting them to hospital soon. TOI also contacted two patients who had tested positive on Friday and they said that they are at home and they haven’t been shifted to hospitals. “I have received my test report on Saturday morning and have been told to remain indoors. I had come from Pune and arrived at Hatia railway station on Thursday,” said a 28-year-old man from Chatra district. Another woman in her forties and a resident of Jagganathpur area said: “I have come from Odisha and arrived here on Thursday. I have received four calls till now about my test report but no one has asked me to get admitted to a hospital.” Experts have warned an increase in cases in coming weeks citing the migration of people from various parts of the country for Diwali and Chhath Puja. “The cases will increase in next two weeks as people will return home for celebrations from various parts of the country. We need to put in stringent measures at exit and entry points so that people could be tested immediately after their arrival,” said public health expert and professor of community medicine at RIMS, Dr Dewesh Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/55-test-positive-at-hatia-railway-station-admin-fails-to-track-them/articleshow/87230594.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Health minister Banna Gupta directed the officials concerned to conduct a probe into the matter in a tweet. The victims belonged to different villages of the Barharwa block. Following Gupta’s tweet, Sahibganj civil surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar on Saturday ordered a probe into the incidents. Talking to TOI over the phone, Kumar said, “The health minister informed me about the incidents over the phone on Friday night as none of the victims turned up to complain about their visual loss after undergoing cataract surgeries. I rushed to Barharwa soon after getting the call from the minister to have first-hand information about the matter.” Later, Kumar constituted a six-member committee headed by the district tuberculosis officer, Dr Thomas Murmu, and Dr Sarita Kumari Tudu, the medical officer (in-charge) of the community health centre of Barharwa, Dr Iqbal Ansari, the eye specialist at the Sahibganj sadar hospital, Dr Rajkumar Sah, an eye specialist at the Rajmahal sub-divisional hospital, Amit Kumar, the district data manager, and Pravin Kumar Saxena, a clerk at Sahibganj civil surgeon’s office as members, to probe the incident. He said, “I have directed the committee to submit its probe report within 24 hours. Proper action will be taken against those found guilty. “The management of the private hospital has taken three persons to Kolkata for treatment of the visual loss and the exact number of the victims is yet to be ascertained,” Kumar added. The civil surgeon also said the victims were the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat and they underwent the operation at the Jharkhand Sewa Sadan, a private hospital. The surgeries are reported to have taken place at the private hospital between October 5 and October 7 and were conducted by a Bengal-based eye surgeon, Dr H K Vishwash. Rural development minister and Pakur MLA Alamgir Alam have forwarded the names of four victims to Kumar. The victims had turned up to the private hospital on Friday for removal of the bandages and realised that they have lost their vision. Following their loss of vision, their attendants and relatives resorted to vandalism at the hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/12-go-blind-after-cataract-surgery-at-jharkhand-hospital/articleshow/87230646.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

He has covered extensively about the rural sector and the life of a farmer. While moderating the event, Sachin Jahagirdar said the topic is close to “everyone’s heart”. Tanvir Mirza was the co-moderator. Hardikar spoke about why he chose the topic for the book. “I always wanted to voice out the farmer’s struggles. I realized that someone must talk and spread awareness about this topic. Writing for the rural areas has been an adventure to me and I think awareness will only come into place if it is spread,” he said. While writing the book, Hardikar faced two major difficulties. “The first was to engulf me with the entire topic which was so sensitive. Second, careful analysis and implementing everything with the right words,” he said. Briefing his character Ramrao, Hardikar said, “He is a small farmer who has faced issues like financial instability and has severe health problems. The book revolves around his struggles and through Ramrao’s story several other farmers' true lives will be reflected.” Ujwala Petkar, who is a small farmer and has been widowed for the past 16 years, shared her story about how difficult it is for a woman farmer to get work. “There is so much inequality when I go to buy some tools for farming. I am charged extra for farming tools. It has become a part of my farming career,” she said. Congratulating Hardikar, Eshwar Garg, a guest speaker, said, “The book has surely touched a sensitive subject and through this people would get to know about the agony of the farmer’s protest.” Hardikar also took questions from the audience. He was also gifted a painting by Std 12 student Harsh Ujjainkar.

The student’s application had been rejected by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment despite the applicant meeting all prescribed conditions. ‘The Platform’, an organization of Ambedkarite thinkers from Nagpur, filed a writ petition on behalf of the Odisha boy in the Delhi high court, which ruled in their favour on September 29. Though the ministry issued a provisional scholarship award letter to the aggrieved student Aruna Mahananda on October 1, it is yet to release confirmation letter. The NOS portal for this year’s applications closed on October 15. Alleging similar denial of benefits under the National Overseas Scholarship (NOS) to many eligible students, 27-year-old Aruna said in case the ministry holds back the final letter he may lose another year. The ministry had rejected his application this time stating his marks were below the cut off 60% while in earlier two attempts it was rejected for “lack of required documents”. However, he submitted before the court that he had scored 68% at post-graduation level. Aruna hails from Kalahandi district, which is one of the most backward places in the country. “My father is a poor labourer. I am the first generation to be educated in the family. There is no one in my family to guide me on how to get the process expedited. The Platform helped me file a case and get the provisional NOS letter,” he said. Aruna has done MA in social work, criminology, and justice from TISS Mumbai in 2018, This was his third attempt to secure the NOS. University of Essex (United Kingdom) has confirmed his admission to PhD in criminology. The programme began on October 7 but due to the ministry’s delays, Aruna has already missed the joining date. “I lost two years because of their mistake. University of Essex has sought confirmation from the ministry but it is not responding. Last date for PhD registration is November 3. The ministry is aware of this. For no reason, I am running pillar to post. Many eligible students don’t opt for legal process fearing similar harassment. I feel mentally harassed,” said Aruna. Vishal Kharat, a student from Aurangabad, said, “For the last 2 year, I’m trying to get this scholarship for PhD in arts, but many times the scholarship portal doesn’t work properly. The ministry and NOS department should update the website.” THE CASE National Overseas Scholarship Scheme (NOS) department rejected Aruna’s application It stated his marks were below cut off percentage of 60% NOS is for children of SC, ST and landless agricultural labourers Aruna approached The Platform of Nagpur to move Delhi HC HC ruled in his favour on Sep 29 On Oct 1, ministry issued provisional award letter but is yet to release final letter ************* QUOTE The fight is not over yet and we will file a PIL in the court to resolve all the issues soon.

---||Nagpur||After 20 years, NMC set to asphalt Sawakar Nagar Sq-Ajni Sq road||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is all set to asphalt the stretch of Khamla Road from Sawarkar Nagar Square (also known as Orange City Hospital Square) to Ajni Square. Tendering process has kicked-off. A large number of people use the road on daily basis. It has not been tarred for over last 20 years. The road is in a bad condition with several potholes and scaled surface layer. TOI on October 15 had reported that the road had been left out not only from Cement Concrete Road Project phase-I but also from recent approval granted for asphalting 17 major roads. Taking cognisance of the report, the civic body has issued tender of Rs1.41 crore on October 18 for asphalting the road. The tender will be opened on November 15. The contractor will be given 45 days to complete the project from the date of issuing work order. The tender was issued before seeking administrative approval from the standing committee. The approval was obtained on Friday. The road was part of Cement Concrete Road Project phase-I implemented in June 2011. But it was never concretized. Contractor Unity Infraprojects Private Limited cited water pipeline below the road for the inordinate delay. In February 2019, the contractor quit the project. Tender for concretizing the remaining roads under the project is awaited.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/after-20-yrs-nmc-set-to-asphalt-sawakar-nagar-sq-ajni-sq-road/articleshow/87230543.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Though the CBI probe into the traders’ nexus with international smugglers is learnt to be rolling with routine speed, illegal activities seemed to be continuing with the regular momentum leading to health hazards posed by the poor quality of betel nuts. The revelation of Addl DG, law and order, Nagaland, Sandeep Tamgadge highlighted the fact that trucks laden with beetel nut or areca nut are often found heading towards Central India from the Indo-Mayanmar border. “Interrogation of some of the truckers intercepted with obnoxious quality betel nut coming from Myanmar indicated their destination at different locations of central India among others,” said Tamgadge under whose supervision Nagaland police have seized 48.15 kg gold worth Rs 22 crore. Tamgadge, who shared Nagaland police’s success in cracking down on drugs, arms and gold coming from across the Myanmar border, said betel nut trucks are heading towards Nagpur after crossing either Bihar, Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh or take the route of West Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh to enter Central India. The IPS officer stated that beetel nut traders are likely to have a well-oiled network across several states to be able to cross them with illegal consignments and forged documents. “The state police must be extremely sensitive about these trucks as one would never know what else would they bring from disturbed Myanmar where insurgent groups sell arms, ammunition and drugs to fund their private armies and governance,” he said. The investigation, revolving around the evasion of crores of rupees of tax and duty evasion, was handed over to CBI by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court. After the court handed over the probe to the CBI, shunting out the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI), the agency had registered an offence in March earlier this year and conducted searches at four places towards the end of June. Even the unidentified custom and excise department officials too were mentioned as accused. Advocate RS Renu, who represented Mehboob Chimthanwala in his PIL against unscrupulous betel traders, said he intended to seek intervention of the high court to review the progress of the investigation by CBI who seemed to have made no substantial progress in the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/betel-nut-smuggling-probe-by-cbi-on-the-backburner/articleshow/87230551.cms||Soumitra Bose

The concept of a counselling and dispute resolution unit on the lines of Bharosa Cell, which was formed in 2017, was also replicated elsewhere in the state. CP Amitesh Kumar, who has been reviewing the dispute redressal mechanism and regular cases of the cell, said that around 40% of the complaints revolve around family disputes. “In view of the complainants from various parts of the city facing issues with approaching the cell at its current location, we may either open a new unit or an extension in Central Nagpur,” said the CP and added, “Our priority is to amicably resolve issues and save families from shattering,” he said. The cell, a brainchild of former CP K Venkatesham, has attended 1,513 complaints or grievances till September this year. Under senior inspector Seema Surve, the cell has resolved 486 cases. Last year, the cell had attended to 1,438 cases and resolved 475. In 2019, it tasted success in more than 44% of cases after taking up 1,649 and resolving 735. PI Surve said a team of eight counsellors attends to the complainants. “We are officially hearing around 225 matters on a monthly basis. First, we listen to the problem and then create a case. Then, the other party is allowed to put forth his or her stand. Then, a joint meeting or counselling session is held,” she said. Surve said the aim is to settle the dispute gradually through repeated joint counselling sessions. “We do face challenges in handling inter-personal grievances, especially when one of the parties turns aggressive,” said the woman inspector. She said that if the complainant wants to continue staying at their kin’s place during the dispute then the matter is referred to the ‘protection officer’. “If we see that the issue is serious and requires legal action, then it is referred to the police stations for registration of FIR,” she said. The cop said that they deal in cases involving persons from various strata of society. “We have managed to reconcile many clashing couples and save families,” said Surve. The popularity of the cell has promoted independent corporator Abha Pande to hand over a representation to the state home minister Dilip Walse Patil, who was in the city for crime review meeting this month, asking for a branch or a new unit at four more locations or zones in the city. She has requested Walse Patil to strengthen Bharosa Cell.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/city-polices-bharosa-cell-wins-trust-resolves-1696-family-disputes-in-3-yrs/articleshow/87230577.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Gurgaon||Haryana to give its staff smartwatches for attendance, tracking while at work||GURUGRAM: Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday announced the state will soon distribute GPS-enabled smartwatches among government employees to track their real-time location and record attendance. It will mark a progression from the previous roster and the subsequent biometric system by eliminating loopholes that allowed attendance to be manipulated, the CM said. Already in use in the Panchkula Municipal Corporation and Chandigarh administration, the GPS-enabled monitoring system has triggered protests from workers who have claimed that it breached their privacy. Addressing a rally in Sohna on Saturday, the CM, however, said the new system will bring about “transparency and accountability in operations, and weed out fake, duplicate and false attendance”. Referring to the manual system of marking attendance in a register before 2014, the year he assumed office after BJP won the state election, Khattar said, “An employee would come to office after a week and put tick marks for all the days in the week in the attendance register. We introduced a biometric system after the formation of our government to bring discipline and regularise attendance of government employees.” After the implementation of the biometric system some people, however, found ways to manipulate it. “Some made fake fingerprints (using rubber) and gave it to another person for punching in their attendance in his/her absence,” the CM said, adding that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the biometric system was finally suspended as it posed a risk of spreading the virus. “I asked my team to find a solution to this dual problem and… found a solution in ‘ghari’ (watches). The watches will function only in the hands of the authorised person. It will send the real-time location of the employees to the central control room and their attendance will be then marked,” Khattar said. The smartwatches, meant to be worn during working hours, that are used by the Panchkula civic body and Chandigarh administration were provided by ITI, the central government undertaking that also provides an end-to-end solution, including servers, application software, web interface and related MIS reports, officials said. The watch costs around Rs 7,500 to Rs 8,000 and the government agency has to pay in monthly instalments. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation was the first to introduce such GPS-enabled wrist watches in 2018 under the Smart City Project. The chief minister also unveiled a statue of Maharana Pratap and laid the foundation stones of a few development projects. He also announced projects worth Rs 125 crore for Sohna and said five mega infrastructure projects – Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) expressway, Orbital railway corridor from Kundli to Palwal, Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, western dedicated railway corridor and Gurugram-Alwar Road — will pass through Sohna and lead to its development. The CM, meanwhile, acknowledged that the state was facing a shortage of fertilizers but assured farmers that they will get adequate supply and urged them not to hoard. He also spoke about the misuse of old age pension and other government schemes. “We are creating profiles of each and every resident of the state and categorising them on the basis of their income. The benefits of the government schemes will be provided to only those on the list,” Khattar said. Sohna has around 38,000 families with an annual income of less than Rs 1 lakh, the CM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/hry-to-give-its-staff-smartwatches-for-attendance-tracking-while-at-work/articleshow/87231116.cms||Bagish Jha

---||Nagpur||Nitin Gadkari for sugarcane cultivation in Vidarbha over cotton & soyabean||NAGPUR: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has suggested to the Vidarbha farmers to opt for sugarcane cultivation to tackle the perennial issue of crop loss and doing away with dependency on widely cultivated cotton and soyabean crops. He made this while addressing the farmers at Mandwa village in Wardha district on Monday where he reviewed the rejuvenation work of Dham river and Moti nullah. Farm experts, activists and farmers, however, disagree with Gadkari’s advice and said that the sugarcane crop was unsustainable in Vidarbha due to water scarcity, particularly during summers. If a majority of farmers start cultivating sugarcane it would worsen the already depleting groundwater level as it requires more water as compared to other crops like cotton, soyabean, paddy and pulses traditionally grown in the region, the experts said. Vidarbha has earned the ignominy of reporting high number of farmers suicide in the country over the last two decades. Sounding a warning note, the experts said that sugarcane cultivation would aggravate the agrarian crisis and leave a trail of distressed farmers. “Sugarcane is a water guzzling crop, which is not suitable for Vidarbha due to multiple factors. Its growth is hampered in the summer here. Moreover, the crop needs to be in the 10-15km periphery of a sugar plant else the transportation cost would spiral making it non-feasible for the farmers. It is precisely the reason why the sugar factories have failed to survive in this part of the state,” farm activist Vijay Jawandhiya says. Gadkari told the farmers that he wanted to replicate the success story of their counterparts in western parts of Maharashtra, particularly Kolhapur, Solapur and Sangli, in Vidarbha. Citing numerous examples of farmers, whom he felicitated for producing over 75-100 tonnes of sugarcane in Vidarbha, the Nagpur MP said it would bring prosperity to the region’s farmers. “On the way to Mandwa, I was felicitated by a farmer, who had produced over 100 tonnes of sugarcane and he earns over Rs 1 lakh per month. My dream is to enrich the farmers here through cash rich crops like sugarcane. Our (Manas group) factory has the capacity to crush over seven lakh tonnes of sugarcane, but we only get one lakh tonnes from Vidarbha,” he says. Jawandiya says it was unfair to liken the conditions in western parts of the state and Vidarbha especially with regard to the inadequate irrigation facilities and climatic conditions. Maharashtra is one of the biggest sugarcane producers in India, but many parts of the state suffered acute water shortage in the last few years. Farm experts add that sugarcane farmers were always helped by the government through bailout packages as many big leaders from western Maharashtra have their sugar mills and operate their strong lobby. “The sugar industry is always protected by the politicians in our state. It is definitely not a cash crop in Vidarbha and Marathwada. For these regions, cotton, soybean, pulses are actual cash crops. Both regions witness continuous climate change that makes sugarcane non-feasible to cultivate. Top leaders should not give such misleading advice to the poor farmers, who are already in dire straits,” says farm activist Kishore Tiwari, who is also a Shiv Sena leader. Endorsing Jawandhiya and Tiwari, farmer Ganesh Nanote says the sugarcane crop has a cycle of about 14 months to provide returns. In this period, they can take three cycles of crops like cotton, soybean and paddy. “Vidarbha already faces vagaries of nature including drought, incessant rains and load-shedding. In such a situation, sugarcane cultivation is a risky proposition. Moreover, it will increase farmers’ input cost in the form of erecting fences or compound walls around the farm to protect the crop from animals like wild boar and Nilgai. Even the farm labourers will demand higher charges for harvesting this crop. Traditional crops like cotton and paddy can give us similar benefits if those are provided with proper technology and research from the government,” he says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/gadkari-for-sugarcane-cultivation-in-vid-over-cotton-soyabean/articleshow/87230639.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The tiger estimation exercise in the area will have to be started from scratch,” R K Tiwari, warden of the reserve, told TOI. The reserve area spans 520sqkm. The camera traps were installed earlier this month to track the tiger count of the area for a nationwide estimation exercise. Corbett authorities said 494 camera traps had been installed in Ramnagar division. Almost all zones of the reserve lost camera traps, but Dhela zone — which lost 10 — and Bijrani zone, where four camera traps were washed away, were the worst affected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/floods-drown-camera-traps-tiger-count-in-corbett-will-have-to-start-again/articleshow/87232270.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi 1st city to hit 2 crore vaccine doses, Mumbai at 1.4 crore||NEW DELHI: Delhi became the first Indian city to administer 2 crore vaccine doses against Covid-19, reaching the milestone on Saturday, two days after the country achieved the landmark of 100 crore cumulative vaccine shots. The capital is the 18th state to have crossed the 2-crore mark. Delhi is way ahead of other Indian cities in total number of vaccine doses administered. Mumbai comes second with just over 1.4 crore shots so far, including over 90 lakh first doses and more than 53.4 lakh second doses. 85.9% of Delhiites have got at least 1 dose of Covid vax  Bengaluru is a close third with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) district recording a total 1,28,85,921 shots so far, 79.4 lakh first doses and 49.4 lakh second doses. In terms of percentage of eligible population covered, however, Mumbai is ahead of Delhi. There are around 1.5 crore adults in Delhi, of which 47.7% have been fully vaccinated and 85.9% have received at least one dose. Mumbai, which has an approximate adult population of 93.5 lakh, has seen 57.1% of its eligible beneficiaries being fully vaccinated and 96.4% of all beneficiaries have received at least one dose of vaccine. The total number of vaccine doses administered in Delhi stood at 2,00,46,547, which includes 71,53,287 beneficiaries who have been fully vaccinated till 7 pm on Saturday, as per the CoWIN dashboard of the Union health ministry. While it took 197 days for Delhi to administer the first 1 crore doses of the vaccine (from January 16 to July 31), the figure reached the 2-crore mark in less than three months on Saturday due to higher number of jabs being administered in August and September. This month, however, has seen numbers dip, and on Saturday, 73,711 vaccine doses were administered till 8pm. District officials said that the numbers are on the lower side due to the ongoing festive season in October. Apart from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, Pune is the fourth city in the country where more than 1 crore vaccine doses have been given. The city has administered 1,18,67,944 vaccine doses so far, including more than 77.5 lakh first doses and 41.1 lakh second doses. The other two metro cities of the country - Kolkata and Chennai - are way behind, with 75,76,653 and 69,92,675 vaccine doses being administered, respectively. In fact, districts such as Thane (79.9 lakh) and Ahmedabad (71.4 lakh) have seen more doses being administered than Chennai. Out of the more than 2 crore shots given in Delhi, 63.9% have been received by those in the 18 to 44 years age category - 1,28,22,569. The number of doses administered to those in the 45 to 59 years age category is 48,08,326, which is 23.9% of the total doses administered and those aged 60 years and above have received 24,15,652 doses, which is 12% of the total number. The North West district has administered a total 23,96,252 vaccine doses, the highest among all revenue districts of the capital. The North East district has seen the least number of doses being administered - 12,55,828.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/covid-19-delhi-1st-city-to-hit-2-crore-vaccine-doses-mumbai-at-1-4-crore/articleshow/87232315.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||World||UK says time running out for solution in Brexit trade talks||LONDON: The British government tried Saturday to speed up the pace of talks to resolve post-Brexit trade troubles with the European Union, saying the two sides remain far apart and time is running out to bridge the gap. UK and EU negotiators have met in Brussels over the past week to try and resolve major differences that have erupted over trade rules for Northern Ireland. The talks move to London on Tuesday, and Britain says "substantial gaps on the fundamental issues remain." The UK government said talks so far had been "constructive" but added that "we need to see real progress soon rather than get stuck in a process of endless negotiation because the issues on the ground in Northern Ireland haven't gone away." Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK and shares a border with EU member Ireland, remains inside the EU's tariff-free single market for goods, even though the UK left the 27-nation bloc at the end of 2020. That special status ensures there is an open border on the island of Ireland - a key pillar of Northern Ireland's peace process since the 1998 Good Friday accord. But it means a new customs border in the Irish Sea for goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, even though they are part of the same country. That has brought red tape for businesses, and caused problems with some goods reaching Northern Ireland. EU rules on chilled meats led to a brief sausage shortage, and now Britain claims that Christmas crackers - festive noisemakers that are a holiday party staple - are being prevented from reaching Northern Ireland. The new arrangements have also angered Northern Ireland's British Unionists, who say the checks undermine Northern Ireland's place in the U.K. and destabilize the delicate political balance on which peace rests. The EU accuses Britain of trying to renegotiate a legally binding agreement that it signed less than a year ago; some officials say it shows the UK government can't be trusted. The bloc has, however, agreed to make changes to the deal, offering to reduce checks on food, plants and animals entering Northern Ireland by as much as 80 per cent and to cut paperwork for transport companies in half. Britain has welcomed those proposals, but also is demanding that the EU's top court be stripped of its role resolving any disputes over the agreement and replaced with independent arbitration - an idea the bloc flatly rejects. Chief negotiators Maros Sefcovic of the EU and David Frost for Britain are due to meet in London at the end of next week to assess the talks' progress. Britain on Saturday repeated a threat to trigger an emergency break clause that lets either side suspend the agreement in extreme circumstances if there is no breakthrough soon. That would bring legal action from the EU, and potentially economic sanctions that could spiral into a trade war. Any such battle is likely to hurt the economy of the UK more than the much bigger EU. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney also warned that talks couldn't go on forever, and urged Britain on Friday to respond to the EU's willingness to compromise. "I think the EU has shown a real appetite for compromise, and they have consciously avoided creating tension," he said. "I can't say the same in terms of the British government's approach." "I don't think it will be the case forever, that the EU will be in compromise and solutions mode."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-says-time-running-out-for-solution-in-brexit-trade-talks/articleshow/87232342.cms||---

---||World||Turkey's Erdogan orders expulsion of 10 ambassadors||ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday told his foreign minister to expel the ambassadors of 10 countries, including Germany and the United States, who had appealed for the release of a jailed civil society leader. The envoys issued a highly unusual joint statement on Monday saying the continued detention of Parisian-born philanthropist and activist Osman Kavala "cast a shadow" over Turkey. The escalating row with the Western countries -- most of which are also NATO allies -- caps a torrid week for Turkey in which it was added to a global money-laundering and terrorism-financing blacklist and its currency plunged over fears of economic mismanagement and the risk of hyperinflation. "I have ordered our foreign minister to declare these 10 ambassadors as persona non grata as soon as possible," Erdogan said, using a diplomatic term meaning the first step before expulsion. "They must leave here the day they no longer know Turkey," he said, accusing them of "indecency". Several European countries said late on Saturday they had received no official notification from Turkey. "We are currently in intensive consultation with the nine other countries concerned," the German Foreign Ministry said. "Our ambassador has not done anything that would justify the expulsion," Norwegian foreign ministry spokeswoman Trude Maseide told media in her home country. She vowed to continue pressing Turkey on human rights and democracy -- comments echoed by Danish and Dutch officials. The United States was aware of the reports and was seeking clarity from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a State Department spokesperson said. Kavala, 64, has been in jail without a conviction since 2017 on charges linked to 2013 anti-government protests and a failed military coup in 2016. The Western ambassadors had called for a "just and speedy resolution" to his case. But on Saturday, Erdogan described Kavala as the "agent in Turkey" of Hungary-born American billionaire George Soros -- a regular target of right-wing and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Kavala's supporters see him as a symbol of the sweeping crackdown Erdogan unleashed after surviving a 2016 coup attempt. Kavala told AFP from his cell last week that Erdogan was trying to blame foreign conspiracy for opposition to his almost two-decade rule, particularly the 2013 nationwide protests sparked by plans to demolish Gezi park in Istanbul. "Since I am accused of being a part of this conspiracy allegedly organised by foreign powers, my release would weaken the fiction," he said. Kavala was acquitted of charges linked with the Gezi protests last year only to be re-arrested before he could return home over alleged links to the 2016 coup plot. Human rights watchdog the Council of Europe has issued a final warning to Turkey to comply with a 2019 European Court of Human Rights order to release Kavala pending trial. If it fails, Turkey could eventually have its voting rights or even its membership suspended. Erdogan faces multiple challenges at home and abroad, with global financial misconduct watchdog FATF placing Turkey under surveillance for failing to properly combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Erdogan passed anti-terror laws but they failed to impress FATF and critics said the new rules mostly targeted Turkish NGOs that promote pro-Kurdish causes and human rights. The president's attacks on Kavala this week caused jitters in the markets with fears of a deepening confrontation with the West sending the lira slumping even further against the dollar. Erdogan is in danger of "dragging the Turkish economy into a president-made crisis", Eurasia Group said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/turkeys-erdogan-orders-expulsion-of-10-ambassadors/articleshow/87232394.cms||---

---||India||Working with India to boost defence ties: UK||NEW DELHI: While indicating that the UK may be planning a longer-term presence in the Indian Ocean region, visiting British foreign secretary Liz Truss told TOI that the two countries are working together with “more military exercises and cooperation between our services”. Indian government sources confirmed that both sides are working towards deepening their defence and security relationships, particularly in the Indian Ocean region. The UK already maintains a base in Bahrain and is keen to partner with India in the region, Truss said. Finishing her official meetings in Delhi, Truss travelled to Mumbai on Saturday to board the UK carrier QE2 at Mumbai port. According to the British high commission’s official readout, Truss is expected to continue discussions on “developing innovative security and defence tech with the Indian government”. “The foreign secretary sees developing this security and defence relationship with India, as a key part of the UK’s Indo-Pacific tilt. The foreign secretary sees India as essential in ensuring a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” the release said. Truss said the focus of the bilateral relationship is on trade, technology and security. India and the UK are in the process of getting an early harvest trade deal, though there are as yet no timelines for closing the negotiations. Technology, however, is the key driver of the UK-India relationship now, she said. Questioned about the tech sectors, Truss said the two countries are cooperating on 5G and cybersecurity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-with-india-to-boost-defence-ties-uk/articleshow/87232447.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The proposal has been forwarded to the Centre after Ayodhya’s BJP MP Lallu Singh recommended the name change to the state government and Railways. “Naming the railway junction after Ayodhya is a natural procedure after Faizabad district was rechristened Ayodhya in 2018. This is being done to avoid confusion. The local MP sent the proposal, and after necessary approvals, the state government forwarded it to the Centre. Renaming of the station can be implemented only by the Railways,” said a government spokesperson. Lucknow divisional railway manager Suresh Kumar Sapra told TOI the proposal would be sent to the home ministry. “On Ayodhya MP’s request, Railways sent the proposal to the state government, which has given its nod. Now, the proposal would be forwarded to the ministry of home affairs for final assent,” he said. On Diwali eve in 2018, CM Yogi Adityanath had announced renaming Faizabad district as Ayodhya to honour the birthplace of Lord Ram and “acknowledge the history of the area”. A week later, the state cabinet approved the decision. The district headquarters, however, continues to remain Faizabad. The UP government has already changed the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Mughalsarai railway junction to Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay junction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-govt-gives-nod-to-rename-faizabad-station-ayodhya-cantonment/articleshow/87232451.cms||---
---||Kolkata||E-commerce on a roll||Kolkata: Electronic commerce may have been born some four decades ago, but the sector witnessed its most dramatic rise in the past couple of years when the pandemic forced offline businesses into lockdown mode. E-commerce platforms — some of which debuted amid this global crisis — are still riding the momentum, with Kolkata and the rest of the eastern India market reporting an “exceptional” spurt in sales in the run-up to Diwali. And, the revenue stream is expected to remain swell until the ball drop for New Year. While the young were already hooked to online shopping, Covid confinement prompted even the elderly to log in for essentials such as groceries and medicines. This dependence on the convenience of doorstep delivery en masse, in turn, jacked up sales figures for even greenhorn e-tailers who are now bullish that the growth graph will continue to go north. Kapil MakhijaAccording to a recent survey by Unicommerce (an e-commerce management service provider), fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), beauty and personal care, health and pharma, and home décor and furniture are among the emerging segments in online shopping. While the FMCG segment reported 73% growth in sales, its sub-segments like food and beverage grew by 72% and 74%, respectively. The face care segment saw an exponential 171% growth followed by hair care at 92% and body care at 31%. “The pandemic has altered the buying pattern of consumers and the tighter embracing of e-commerce platforms has led to the evolution of many new segments in shopping. There has been a phenomenal growth of brand websites and online marketplaces. We want e-tailers to understand these emerging segments,” said Kapil Makhija, the CEO of Unicommerce. Saurabh BansalDelhi-based e-commerce company Snapdeal saw a 98% rise in its first ‘Toofani sale’ this festive season compared to 2020. “Nearly 60% of the orders received came from tier-III cities while tier-1 (including Kolkata) and tier II cities accounted for around 26%. In Kolkata, the apparel segment is trending at 224% compared to last year. People are using our ‘Toofani sale’ offers for both festive shopping and stocking up on regular purchases,” said Saurabh Bansal, the platform’s chief merchandising officer. Snapdeal’s pre-festive season expansion with 130 new logistics hubs helped in fast shipment of more than 60% of the orders, he added. As the country’s homegrown e-commerce marketplace, Flipkart feels the festive season is an opportunity to create value for all stakeholders, including traders and customers. “We are expanding our supply chain across the country and have opened several warehouses in Bengal. For this season, we have hired over 1 lakh people as delivery executives, sorters, pickers and packers. Besides, we have strengthened our ‘Kirana delivery programme’ this year with more than 1 lakh partners in Kolkata and other cities. A new fulfilment centre has come up in Dankuni to ramp up our supply chain infrastructure,” said a company spokesperson. Anondeep GangulySkin and intimate care company Skin Pot has reported a growth of 25% in sales in October, with 12% coming from eastern India, including Kolkata. “D2C (direct-to-consumer) retail brands are expecting to meet their annual sales target this time. They are drawing up strategies to stay ahead in the competition. These brands expect the momentum in sales to continue till December,” said Anondeep Ganguly, founder and CEO of Skin Pot. Jatin AhujaBig Boy Toyz (BBT), a sales hub for pre-owned luxury cars, is swamped with online orders. In October alone, it has delivered 10 cars in the Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore price range. “Transactions have happened online for Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo Polestar and Lexus, among others. There has been a 35% growth in sales this month compared to October 2020,” said Jatin Ahuja, founder and MD of BBT. Harry Sehrawat, co-founder of Sanfe (an online brand for feminine products), boasts a 1.8x jump in festive sales. “The range includes both existing products and new launches. Lucrative discounts up to 35% prompted women to hit buy-buy mode. A major boost in sales was seen on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa and Purplle. With a good number of days left in the festive season, we are set for new categories and brand campaigns,” he said. Vijayaraghavan VenugopalVijayaraghavan Venugopal, CEO and co-founder of Fast&Up, is equally sanguine. “Being a steady usage segment, nutrition has not seen an overwhelming growth amid the festivities. However, excitement in general has picked up. There is a lot more traction through e-commerce for products and the growth is mostly driven by the accelerated online adoption that resulted from the pandemic. The general positivity is good and transgresses categories, including nutrition,” he said. Karthick Solai KSSince the outbreak of the pandemic, TerraBrush — an eco-friendly oral care platform — has been witnessing a spike in sales. The same reached a summit during this festive season. Karthick Solai KS, CEO of the company, said: “If the current trend continues, online shopping may soon replace in-store purchases as it offers the convenience of choosing and buying products from a wide range of varieties.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/e-commerce-on-a-roll/articleshow/87231551.cms||Sarthak Ganguly
---||Kolkata||5 trafficked West Bengal girls rescued from Delhi, 2 from TN||KOLKATA: Five girls aged between 15 and 20 years, who were allegedly trafficked from Dholahat police station area under Sunderban Police district, were rescued from Delhi in an operation that began on Tuesday afternoon and lasted till Thursday. With information from NGO Shakti Vahini, a team of Dholahat Police took the Rajdhani Express to the capital on Wednesday to help Delhi Police and Delhi Commission for Women. The survivors were brought to Kolkata on Saturday on the Purba Express. Two more girls from Nazat under Basirhat Police division, who were trafficked to Tamil Nadu, have also been rescued. Cops have traced two other missing girls from Baduria to TN as well. The NGO said the girls were trapped in organized trafficking rackets during Durga Puja with the promise of better jobs. “With red light areas resuming business to cash in on the festive season, the threat of trafficking has gone up,” said Rishikant of Shakti Vahini. According to sources, on October 19, Shakti Vahini informed the DCW that five girls were being sent to Bengal by Duranto Express. A DCW team reached New Delhi railway station along with Childline and Delhi Police officials and rescued them. While one trafficker was arrested at the station, the main accused managed to flee. Raids are also going on in Sunderban and Baruipur police districts to nab the gangs’ local members. The survivors, who include two minors, said they were brought to Delhi by a woman named Jaina and a man named Laden on the pretext of providing jobs. They said they were kept captive in a room in Madanpur Khadar village. Three of them, including a minor, said they had been sexually assaulted — one by an accused. One of the girls managed to make a call to her family, following which an FIR was registered against Jaina at Dholahat police station. The girls said the accused came to know of the FIR and so decided to move them out of Delhi. A separate case was also registered by Delhi Police. In all, two traffickers have been nabbed. NGOs lauded the Sunderban Police and North 24 Parganas authorities for having acted on each complaint. “This is the level of cooperation that can drive out trafficking in the near future. Their efforts to build awareness in villages are also showing results with missing cases being reported early,” said Rishikant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/5-trafficked-bengal-girls-rescued-from-delhi-2-from-tn/articleshow/87231091.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||‘Join forces to defeat the BJP’, Mamata says ahead of Goa visit||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday urged “all individuals, organisations and political parties to join forces to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda” ahead of her October 28 Goa visit, making it clear that Trinamool Congress is keen to weave in an anti-BJP alliance before the 2022 Goa assembly polls. While the Goa Forward Party has indicated it is already in talks with TMC, the Congress has till now said it will fight the Goa elections on its own. In a Twitter post, Banerjee said, “As I prepare for my maiden visit to Goa on 28th, I call upon all individuals, organisations and political parties to join forces to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda. The people of Goa have suffered enough over the last 10 years. Together, we will usher in a new dawn for Goa by forming a new govt that will truly be a govt of the people of Goa and committed to realising their aspirations! #GoenchiNaviSakal.” The 40-seat Goa assembly elections will be TMC’s first foray in another state outside Bengal after it won the Bengal assembly elections. TMC is also likely to contest the November-end Tripura municipal elections as a first step to build up a challenge against the Biplab Deb government in the 2023 Tripura assembly polls. Congress has a considerable presence in both Goa and Tripura. However, in both places, Congress leaders and workers have been steadily defecting to TMC. TMC’s battle in both Goa and Tripura is being led by senior Congress leaders who defected to TMC. While former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro is leading the Goa poll battle, MP Sushmita Dev is leading the party’s Tripura campaign. TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien is now stationed in Goa, while several MPs and Bengal ministers are camping in Tripura.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/join-forces-to-defeat-the-bjp-mamata-says-ahead-of-goa-visit/articleshow/87231105.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP wants Centre and states to keep fuel prices in check||Kolkata: Bengal BJP wants the Centre to work out a mechanism to hold petroleum prices in check when the spiralling prices are causing “discomfort” to the people. At the same time the party would like the Bengal government to do something “positive” too. “Rising petrol and diesel prices are causing discomfort to people. Citizens have taken to the streets in some places to vent out their anger. This is quite natural. We want the Centre and the states to come together and take effective measures in this regard,” said spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya at a press meet on Saturday. Bhattacharya pointed out that both the Centre and the states levy duty and tax on petrol and diesel. While the Centre charges a fixed amount, states levy VAT. “When Arun Jaitley was the Union finance minister, he had appealed to states to include petroleum products within the GST regime as part of one country, one tax mechanism. Many states had agreed to the proposal barring some like Bengal. The state government insisted that petroleum products should be kept out of the GST regime. The purpose was to levy VAT on fuel prices,” he said. “The ruling Trinamool should leave this politics of confrontation and coordinate with the Centre to evolve a mechanism that can alleviate the pressure on the people,” he said when TMC senior and MP Saugata Roy held that the Centre should cut excise duty on petroleum products. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said: “I hope that the Centre and the states will come together to find a solution.” tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-wants-centre-and-states-to-keep-fuel-prices-in-check/articleshow/87231125.cms||---
---||Business||Prices of petrol and diesel up by 35 paise a litre||NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel prices were hiked for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday by 35 paise per litre, pushing the total increase in rates on petrol to Rs 36 per litre and on diesel to Rs 26.58 since early May 2020 when taxes on the two fuels were raised to record levels. Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 107.24 a litre and diesel comes for Rs 95.97, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. The latest increase that follows the unrelenting hike in international oil prices has pushed pump rates across the country to their highest-ever levels. While petrol is above Rs 100-a-litremark in all major cities, diesel has crossed that level in more than a dozen states. The government had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel to mop up gains that would have otherwise accrued to consumers from international oil prices crashing to as low as USD 19 per barrel. While international prices have since recovered to US$ 85, excise duty has remained at Rs 32.9 per litre on petrol and Rs 31.8 on diesel. Oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday equated demand for cutting excise duty to “axing one’s own feet”, saying such levies funded government schemes to provide free Covid-19 vaccines, meals and cooking gas to millions amid the pandemic. “I think this simplistic political narrative we get in India (that), ‘prices have gone up, why don’t you reduce your taxes’... so every time price goes up due to something else, it says you axe your own feet in the process,” he had said late on Friday. He was asked a question on whether the government would cut taxes, which make up for 54 per cent of the price of petrol and over 48 per cent of diesel, to ease the burden on consumers. The increase in fuel prices has stoked concerns over inflation as diesel is the mainstay fuel used for transporting goods, including agri commodities. Opposition parties including Congress have been critical of the government over the price hikes and have demanded a reduction in taxes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/prices-of-petrol-and-diesel-up-by-35-paise-a-litre/articleshow/87232471.cms||---

The news came after a Friday evening meeting between Schallenberg and state-level leaders to discuss their response to rapidly increasing case numbers. “The pandemic is not yet in the rearview mirror,” Schallenberg said. “We are about to stumble into a pandemic of the unvaccinated.” Schallenberg announced that if the number of Covid patients in intensive-care units reaches 500, or 25 percent of the country’s total ICU capacity, entrance into businesses such as restaurants and hotels will be limited to those who are vaccinated or recovered from the virus. If the number reaches 600, or one-third of total ICU capacity, the government plans to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people. In this case, they would only be allowed to leave their homes for specific reasons. Currently, the number of Covid patients in ICUs stands at 220. In the past week, Austria has reported 20,408 new cases of the virus, according to health authorities, bringing the seven-day average to 228.5 per 100,000 inhabitants. A week earlier, that figure was at 152.5 per 100,000 inhabitants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/austrian-chancellor-threatens-lockdown-for-unvaccinated/articleshow/87232474.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray at HC event says Maharashtra has case of 'complainant missing'||MUMBAI/AURANGABAD: In an apparent reference to former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday that "we have heard of accused being absconding, but we have a case where a complainant has gone missing after making allegations." He also raised the issue of powers of the states in the presence of legal luminaries including Chief Justice of India NV Ramana at the inauguration of the annexe building of the Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court. Referring to Justice DY Chandrachud's speech on the occasion, Thackeray said, "Justice DY Chandrachud said that there is a case pending in Maharashtra where the accused has been absconding since 1958. We have a case where the complainant is missing. We don't know where he is, but raids, inquiries are being conducted based on his complaints. These procedures too need to be re-looked at." He also brought up the issue of power-sharing between the Centre and states. "We are celebrating the 75th year of our country's independence, and if we want to preserve democracy, we have to look at the powers that the Constitution bestows upon the states. The legal luminaries present here should guide the country regarding the rights the Constitution bestows upon us," Thackeray said. "One should not think that if you are sitting in a position that your wish can be your authority and you can do what you like," he added. There have been frequent clashes between the Maha Vikas Aaghadi government in the state and the Centre on different issues. Thackeray said that when Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was framing the Constitution, he was asked about the rights of the Central and state governments, and he answered that except for a few rights to the Centre, the state will be equally sovereign. "Dr Ambedkar had made it clear that the state is equally sovereign, except for a few powers to the Central government. But are these rights of the states being exercised today or are they being curtailed? We cannot afford to lose our independence that has been earned with several sacrifices," he said. He also said that another building for the Bombay high court will be built in Mumbai soon, and he extended an invitation to CJI Ramana for its opening. The state government is scouting for land to set up another building for high court employees. "The responsibility of delivering justice is on all of us, and as the state government, I would like to promise complete assistance in expediting the system," Thackeray said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cm-uddhav-thackeray-at-hc-event-says-maharashtra-has-case-of-complainant-missing/articleshow/87232475.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs Syedna to pay Rs 30 lakh to two Mumbai charities for delaying trial||MUMBAI: Bombay high court has directed Syedna Muffadal Saifuddin to pay Rs 30 lakh as costs for delaying the trial in a challenge to his claim as the spiritual head of the Dawoodi Bohra community. "...the defendant (Saifuddin) will pay an amount of Rs 30 lakh to the following charitable organisations as costs for this completely unnecessary, unwarranted and unjustified delay," said Justice Gautam Patel in his October 21 order. An amount of Rs 15 lakh each "will be donated by or on behalf of the defendant" to St Jude India ChildCare Centres at Sewri and The Society for Rehabilitation of Crippled Children at Mahalaxmi. The challenge is by Taher Fakhruddin in continuation of the claim by his late father Khuzaima Qutbuddin, the half-brother of the 52nd Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin who passed away in January 2014. Saifuddin succeeded his father. Qutbuddin filed a suit in April 2014 challenging Saifuddin's succession as the 53rd Syedna, saying he was secretly anointed successor by Burhanuddin in December 1965. Qutbuddin died in March 2014. His eldest son Fakhruddin then filed a suit claiming he succeeded his father to the title. Justice Patel said he repeatedly extended time for Saifuddin's witnesses and even allowed advance sharing of witness statements with Fakhruddin's side to save time. "Instead, the defendant (Saifuddin) chose to put in his witness affidavits in batches," he added. He said Saifuddin declined to give evidence and proposed to lead evidence of nearly 18 witnesses. Stating that while it is his right to do so "it cannot and does not mean he can constantly take liberties with the court's time or repeatedly fail to adhere to time lines", the court said. "Constant adjournments are sought,''Justice Patel said. He noted Fakhruddin closed his case around March 2020. Also, while the lockdown might have disrupted physical travel, it did not interrupt online communications. Justice Patel said Saifuddin knew the witnesses he had to lead and for what purpose. "To tell me now that the evidence of this or that philologist or witness deposing to doctrine could not be prepared because of the lockdown is unacceptably facile. I refuse to indulge, any litigant, and that includes this defendant, endlessly like this,'' said Justice Patel. Given the names of five witnesses, he said Saifuddin would be allowed "to lead the evidence of these witnesses and no further witnesses." He extended the time for their evidence statements till December 13 and added it will not be extended under any circumstances. "But this extension will now be on terms," said Justice Patel, directing payment of Rs 30 lakh costs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-directs-syedna-to-pay-rs-30-lakh-to-two-mumbai-charities-for-delaying-trial/articleshow/87232516.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Local party leaders are, however, calling the attack the fallout of a “family feud”. Asif Ali, one of the injured admitted to Midnapore Medical College, said supporters of Trinamool block president Uttamananda Tripathi led the attack on him and his associate Saiful Rahman while they were having tea at a stall. “A group of 10-12 men came with lathis and started beating us,” Ali said. Sheikh Sirajul, who rushed the injured to hospital, said Ali and Rahman were former supporters of the block president and were being punished for switching allegiance. Tripathi denied the charge. “They had an altercation at the tea stall, which then took a violent turn. No one from Trinamool is involved,” the block president said. Trinamool’s Ghatal district organisation secretary Ashis Hutait said: “The trouble was triggered by a family feud.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/2-tmc-men-injured-in-keshpur-clash/articleshow/87231083.cms||Sujoy Khanra

Last week, many Durga Puja pavilions and Hindu temples and homes across Bangladesh were attacked and vandalised, including an ISKCON centre in Noakhali, and several people killed in violence that erupted over alleged blasphemy at a marquee in Comilla. Later, they prayed for those who lost their lives in the violence. ISKCON Mayapur codirector Subekshana Das, a devotee from Poland, flayed the attacks. “ISKCON devotees participated in a worldwide peaceful demonstration of pain and grief of the global Hindu community, which stands in solidarity with the Hindus of Bangladesh,” ISKCON Mayapur media spokesperson Subroto Biswas said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iskcon-stages-protests-at-150-temples-across-globe-against-bangla-violence/articleshow/87232522.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Abhishek Banerjee in Gosaba: Vote for Mamata Banerjee, save India||GOSABA (SOUTH 24 PARGANAS): Trinamool Congress national secretary and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee on Saturday pitched the Gosaba assembly bypoll campaign as an integral part of the ‘Save India’ movement against the BJP that his party wants to build in states ahead of the 2024 general elections. Abhishek urged the people to stand beside “Banglar meye” Mamata Banerjee and her party in not just Bengal, but also Tripura and Goa. He stressed that the Trinamool’s win in the four assembly seats in Bengal, where by-elections are scheduled on October 30, would lay the foundation for the battle ahead. “Our candidate in Gosaba is not Subrata Mandal, our candidate is Mamata Banerjee. Give us the highest winning margin from Gosaba. I promise that all pending work in the constituency will be completed. Hold your head high and vote for Mamata Banerjee; Subrata Mandal will bow and work for you,” the Abhishek said. The Trinamool strategy had worked well during the assembly polls earlier this year. Mamata Banerjee’s name had an electrifying effect among the party ranks in this otherwise divided delta constituency, where dissent had recently surfaced over Mandal’s nomination. Abhishek did not delve into local issues. Instead, he wove his campaign around the Trinamool’s strides beyond Bengal. “The entire country is banking on Mamata Banerjee. Take it from me; we are going to form a government in Goa in three months. We will also form a government in Tripura within a year and a half. We will go to other states where democracy is being trampled on,” he said. While showcasing Bengal’s battle against “outsider” BJP, the MP listed a key difference between the Trinamool and the Congress. “Both the parties are fighting against the BJP. But, the Congress has been losing every battle for seven years and the Trinamool winning,” he said, dropping broad hints why Mamata Banerjee should lead the opposition platform against the BJP. To consolidate anti-BJP votes, Abhishek urged Gosaba not to back “fringe parties” like Congress and CPM. “Congress in Bengal teamed up with CPM and ISF, and fought against Trinamool, all to the BJP’s advantage. They barely have any electoral presence. Voting for them is as good as pressing the NOTA button,” he said. The MP further pointed to spiraling prices and the silence of BJP leaders over the economic downturn. “Cooking gas was available for Rs 400 five years ago. Now, a cylinder costs Rs 928. Kerosene too is dearer. The price of petrol has leaped from Rs 50 a litre to Rs 108 while diesel has also crossed the century mark. Farmers are hit hard by the BJP’s anti-people policies. Small traders are reeling under the GST regime,” he said. Abhishek reminded Gosaba voters what Amit Shah had promised during the Bengal assembly poll campaign. “The Union home minister had promised a Rs 2 lakh crore development package for the Sunderbans. Where is he now? Did PM Modi’s Rs 15 lakh reach your accounts po-st-notebandi? But, you have already got Mamata Banerjee’s Rs 25,000 under Kanyashree scheme. You have got Swasthya Sathi cards. Work is on for Lakshmir Bhandar and student credit cards. Unlike others, Mamata Banerjee keeps her promises.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/abhishek-in-gosaba-vote-for-mamata-save-india/articleshow/87231137.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Speaking after his arrival at the airport here, he said that they had fast-tracked the procurement of machinery and material at its site. “After we acquired the Ruchi Soya company, our focus was little diverted. Now, we would be fully focusing on the Nagpur plant. Our dream of manufacturing the Patanjali products from Nagpur would be realized soon,” he said. For over four years after its groundbreaking ceremony in 2017, the work on Patanjali Food and Herbal Park Nagpur Limited could not be started and about 232 acres of land allotted for it in the Mihan’s non-SEZ area was lying idle. The work began this year only after MADC issued an ultimatum to the Ayurved major to start their production by December this year. The company is also expected to invest Rs 300-Rs 400 crore from its own resources, as procuring loans from the banks was taking time, as per group’s managing director Acharya Balkrishna. Baba Ramdev was also critical of the film industry regarding the drug cases, calling it to clear the “kachra” if it wanted to survive. “The young generation, which considers Bollywood actors as role models, is being vitiated by their acts. Drug consumption is being glamorized in the film industry, which is very unfortunate,” he said. He reiterated that yoga and ayurveda outscore allopathy in the healthcare sector, except in surgery and other complicated procedures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/baba-ramdev-hopeful-of-starting-patanjalis-mihan-plant-by-dec-end/articleshow/87230636.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The move came following the one-day hunger strike by Anupama in front of the secretariat to protest inaction by the authorities even six months after her first complaint in April and blatant violations by Child Welfare Committee and police. Media spotlight on the issue threatened to snowball into a major political storm. Won’t sit idle: AnupamaHealth, women and child welfare minister Veena George said instructions were given to the government pleader to inform the court regarding Anupama’s claim and her demand that the baby should be given back to her after conducting a DNA test. “The government is trying to save Anupama from a complex legal battle as the adoption process is in the final stage in the court. Based on her demands, the state adoption agency has filed a petition in the court. The court has also been informed about the department inquiry into her claims,” Veena said, adding that she had spoken to Anupama over phone and the government wants the mother to be reunited with her child. Meanwhile, Anupama expressed happiness over the government action but said she was not ready to sit idle till she gets her baby back. The hunger strike, she said, was mainly against police officers, government institutions and authorities who refused to address her grievance until she broke the story to the media. Even as CPM leadership publicly expressed support to Anupama, Anupama said she was not willing to trust the party as none of its leaders whom she had approached in the past one year helped her. “I am staging this protest as I have no trust in what CPM leaders say now. I want justice and wish nobody else faces this kind of predicament. I want to gather more support for my fight as I’m left with no other option. The government system should provide justice,” Anupama said at the strike venue. Anupama and her husband Ajith Kumar said they would approach the court and lodge complaints with the Child Welfare Council and Child Welfare Committee that facilitated the adoption of her baby. Meanwhile, Ajith Kumar’s former wife Nasiya claimed that Anupama had signed the adoption documents on her own. Anupama, however, rejected the claim and said Nasiya was being used as a pawn by her father. “My father had earlier promised her a job if she could successfully resist the divorce with Ajith,” Anupama claimed. Reacting to the developments, opposition leader V D Satheesan claimed CPM was taking the law into its hands. "There is a law of the land prevailing in this country. CPM is ignoring that and the result is that a party leader's daughter is now protesting in front of the state secretariat asking for her child," Satheesan said. CPM leader Brinda Karat said what happened to Anupama was extremely unjust and unfair. "Taking the baby away from the mother is a criminal act. I think an investigation is on. We all have to stand with Anupama and ensure that she gets her baby back," Karat said. Earlier in the day, various youth organisations staged a protest march to the office of the Child Welfare Committee office.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-cpm-adopts-former-sfi-leader-anupama-s-chandran-mum-on-nimisha/articleshow/87232551.cms||---

It’s said that Col Barog – nobody seems to know his first name – was in charge of building tunnel 33. Because it is a very long tunnel – 3,752 feet long – he started digging it from both ends, but his alignment was wrong and the two parts didn’t meet. Barog, the story says, was censured and fined a rupee. Humiliated, he walked up to the mouth of the flawed tunnel with his dog, and shot himself. Oddly, he was buried there, not in Dagshai, or Solan, or Kasauli, or Subathu. While the story is short on detail, even Barog’s “grave” has ghosted. Nobody has seen it in the past 15 years, at least. A team of Unesco observers that tried to find it in 2007 returned disappointed. But the story doesn’t end there. While the place was named Barog in the colonel’s memory, and he took up residence there as a ghost, an Indian diviner named Baba Bhalku “helped” the British railway engineers find the right alignment of the tunnel. Full of gratitude for his service, the viceroy is said to have honoured him. Shimla city even has a railway museum named after Bhalku. BAROG BEFORE BAROGIt’s a fantastic story waiting to be made into a movie, but there is a problem – Barog was called Barog even before work on the tunnel started. This excerpt from The Bombay Gazette of August 14, 1899 is proof: “A detailed and final reconnaissance for the Simla-Kalka railway has now been completed by Mr Harrington (the chief engineer)….The proposed alignment will necessitate the construction of three important tunnels, viz. Koti spur...Barogh...and Tara Devi.” Construction of the Kalka-Simla line didn’t start until the summer of 1900. And Barog figures again in a report from The Engineer of May 25, 1900: “The first sod of the mountain railway from Kalka to Simla has just been turned….The heaviest parts of the undertaking are two large tunnels which have to be made….The second is the Barog tunnel, under the Solon Hill, about halfway to Simla.” NO MENTION OF MISTAKE, OR DELAYThe same report in The Engineer says, “the tunnels are being taken in hand first as they will require upwards of two years to complete…” So, if tunnelling started in May 1900, the earliest it could have finished was in May-June 1902. A report in The Railway Engineer of December 1902 says the two “headings” of the Barog tunnel were to have met on October 24, 1902 – comfortably close to the original estimate. Yes, the project missed the date, but even in December 1902 there was no sense of alarm or panic over the “delay”. The report explains that work on the Barog tunnel was taking long because of natural obstacles. For example, its course lay through sandstone punctuated with springs: “The miners having had to work at times under deluges of water.” Now, if the delay had been on account of a wrong alignment, would the press have glossed over it? Especially the railway and engineering journals? Wrong alignment would have meant a loss of many months, if not years, of effort. BHALKU OR COMPRESSED AIR?In the legend, Bhalku pulls the tunnel project together with his sixth sense, but news reports from that time show it was a technologically advanced operation. In its May 11, 1901 issue, Indian Engineering talks about a “powerful compressed-air plant now being started” at the Barog tunnel. Nineteen months later, The Railway Engineer of December 1902 confirms: “The work has been carried through with the aid of heavy air-compressing machinery got out expressly from England.” Tunneling was only half the work. The tunnel also had to be lined with masonry, a slow job. Three years after work started on the tunnel, The Bombay Gazette of June 15, 1903 said, “The masonry lining of the great Barog tunnel is completed throughout all but 500 feet of its length.” Not once does the name of Bhalku appear in these reports. It’s unlikely the press would have denied him credit just because he wasn’t white. It’s too good a story – a native diviner deciding the alignment of a railway tunnel – to suppress for racial prejudice. RADIO SILENCE ON COLONELThe deadline for the Kalka-Simla railway was October 1903, and passenger services started on November 9, 1903. There was no delay. The Barog tunnel was completed within the overall project schedule. Coming back to Col Barog, is it possible that his “mistake” didn’t upset the project at all? Also, why is there no report about his suicide in the papers from that time? A British colonel killing himself in India would have been a big deal. It would have been reported in not only India but also the UK and Australia. Yet, you find no mention of a Col Barog anywhere. He does not figure even in the project plans. Other people are listed in charge of work at Barog, Dharampur and Solan throughout. Hence the question: how real is the ghost of Barog?||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-real-is-the-man-behind-barog-tunnels-famous-ghost/articleshow/87232558.cms||Abhilash Gaur

Far from angry, at times it felt like an uplifting celebration as the Iskcon devotees chanted Hare Krishna, jumped, danced and sang, around an altar they had erected in front of the High Commission devoted to the two men murdered at Iskcon Bangladesh, where 10 devotees were also injured. Around 250 Iskcon devotees took part, whilst buses brought devotees from BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, who were joined by many other Bangladeshi and Hindu groups. Holding placards saying ‘Stop violence against Hindus’, the protesters demanded punishment for the perpetrators and greater protection for minorities. Radha Mohan Das, from Iskcon Temple, Bhaktivedanta Manor, was quick to stress no religion was responsible for the violence. “They used weapons and fire and looted the temple. They burnt a statue of Srila Prabhupada. The two men who were killed had no chance. It was organised thuggery," he said. “It is important that justice is done but this is not a religious matter. The solutions are spiritual – dialogue, mutual respect between religions, love, forgiveness and peace – not thuggery,” he said. He delivered a letter addressed to Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK, Saida Muna Tasneem, calling for a meeting. Raj, 40, a Bangladeshi Hindu born in Sylhet, said that uneducated poor Bangaldeshis were brainwashed by hardline Islamic scholars in Bangladesh to carry out these attacks. “All the media in Bangladesh is controlled by the government. What has happened is not coming out in the Bangladesh media. Inside the government, there are people who are silent on what is happening. Hindu women are scared to go out in bindis and bangles. The people behind the violence are never punished, that is why it keeps happening,” he said.

According to the Kalamandalam sources, out of the10 students who have been admitted for Kathakali section in Class VII this year, nine are girls. Kalamandalam vice-chancellor T K Narayanan said giving admission to girls for Kathakali course was a long-pending demand, and “this year we decided to fulfil it.” Art Critic K K Gopalakrishnan said even though Kathakali is perceived as a highly masculine art form and female roles are traditionally handled by men, there have been attempts by women to take up this art right from the 18th century. Gopalakrishnan, who has devoted one chapter on ‘women in Kathakali’ in his research book ‘Kathakali Dance-Theatre’, said more women had started practising this art between 1970 and 1990. Some women from abroad had also undergone short-term courses in Kathakali at Kalamandalam earlier, he said. Though there are quite a number of women artists performing Kathakali now, most of them have been trained under individual masters or by some small private coaching centres. “It is a really remarkable development that girls are now getting an opportunity to undergo an institutional training in Kathakali. The course at Kalamandalam will give an opportunity to students to get exposed to a systematic training from diverse spectrum of teachers,” said advocate Ranjini Suresh, a Kathakali exponent from Tripunithura.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-90-yrs-kalamandalam-admits-girls-in-kathakali-course/articleshow/87232650.cms||T Ramavaraman

The urban development and urban housing department has finally invited objections and suggestions from the public at large to finalise the 'Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Regulations, 2021' before November 9. A source close to the development said, "The state government intends to finalise the fire safety and prevention regulations at the earliest and aims to notify the rules before the end of the calendar year." A key source close to the development said, "Although the urban development department has issued draft rules, it is likely to face wider objections from the builders, public at large and even government departments as it is difficult to follow the prescribed rules.'' "Builders' associations and even private building owners have opposed many key rules like two compulsory staircases, which is now mandatory according to the national building code (NBC). In all the major cities, most of the residential and commercial highrises are being constructed on less than 500 square metre plots, so considering the margin, there is actually no space for a second mandatory staircase for emergency exit. Builder associations, private societies and other commercial establishments have requested to reconsider this rule. Moreover the draft rules suggested fire safety certification from private agencies or private persons which may lead to safety compromise,'' a source said. A key source added, "At present, there is a major shortage of fire safety equipment and qualified personnel to install these. Under pressure from the government, many are installing sub-standard quality equipment. This defeats the very purpose of the new rules for fire safety."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-govt-seeks-suggestions-on-fire-safety-norms/articleshow/87232687.cms||Kapil Dave

More than 50% of the elderly in the state – one of the most vulnerable populations – are yet to take even the first dose of the vaccine. On Saturday, the state launched the sixth edition of the vaccination camp with stockpile of 65 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines – including at least four lakh doses of Covaxin – in 50,000 camps with a hope to push up the average coverage for first and second doses of the vaccine. At the end of the day, only 34% of the vaccines in hand were used as the health workers accounted for just 22.3 lakh vaccinations. Of this nearly 13 lakh people came for the second dose of the vaccine. “Most people who want the vaccines have got it. We are now pushing people who are hesitant to take the vaccine to come to the centres. It is taking a lot of effort and time,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. On Saturday morning, more than 57 lakh people were due for the second dose of vaccination. The vaccine coverage in Tamil Nadu continues to remain below the national average of 76% for the first dose and 31% for the second dose. Until Saturday morning 68% of the state’s population had taken the first dose and 28% had taken the second dose. In absolute numbers, TN is below at least eight other states including UP, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Gujarat and Rajasthan. To encourage more people to get vaccinated, chief minister MK Stalin, ministers, MPs and senior officials visited various camps across the state. On Saturday, Stalin visited camps in Okkiyam Toraipakkam, Kannagi Nagar and Ezhil Nagar. Health minister Ma Subramanian and DPH Dr TS Selvavinayagam toured the central districts. “We have adequate evidence to show that vaccination helps in reducing incidence, hospitalizations and deaths. Yet, some people including those in the vulnerable category are yet to get themselves vaccinated,” he said. Of the estimated 1.14 crore senior citizens in the state, only 47.4lakh people have taken at least one dose. With the state relaxing norms, lack of adequate vaccination coverage could push up cases, health experts said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/over-22-lakh-jabbed-at-6th-mega-vaccination-camp-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/87232688.cms||---

Police said Gopal Hadimani was devastated by the death of his wife, Jaya, on July 6. She had contracted Covid-19 and later mucormycosis and died under treatment. Hadimani retired around three years ago. BELAGAVI TRAGEDYMan fed poison to children before killing himself: CopsPolice said the bodies were found on Saturday morning by neighbours who broke open the door when no one answered their repeated knocks. All five were found lying on the floor, police said. Sowmya, 19, and 16-year-old Shwetha were studying in a private college in Sankeshwar town while Sakshi (11) and Srijan (8) were in school in Borgal. Villagers immediately informed police and Hadimani’s relatives. Police suspect Gopal fed the poison to the children before he consumed it; sources said there were signs of struggle in the house. They are still looking for the poison or its remnants. More details will be known only after the autopsy report, police siad. “I spoke to the children on Friday night on phone and they said they had eaten dinner at 9pm,” said Shobha, a relative. “I don’t know what happened later.” Neighbours said Hadimani had slipped into depression following Jaya’s death and had even stopped talking to them. He was still grieving the death of his wife while the children were slowly recovering, they said. District minister Govind Karjol said he was deeply saddened by the deaths. “I urge people who are suffering from depression to seek help and not make any hasty decisions,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/karnataka-wife-dead-ex-army-man-kills-4-children-self/articleshow/87232694.cms||Shreyas HS

Kerala patients tell their stories||KOCHI: On July 2 this year, more than two months after they had their second dose of Covid vaccine, MA Abdullah (73) and his wife Naseem (65) from Aluva in Ernakulam district were admitted to the hospital with fever, body aches, cough and weakness. “We were in the same room in the hospital, but we were too weak to help each other. Suddenly my wife’s oxygen levels dropped and she developed pneumonia. It was very scary as just two months ago, we had seen our 41-year-old son die of Covid,” said Abdullah. Their unvaccinated son had died of post-Covid pneumonia on May 21, a month before his 42nd birthday after being in hospital for 30 days. Though it’s unnerving to hear of fully vaccinated people falling seriously ill from breakthrough infections, doctors are firm that vaccines work to prevent hospitalisation and death. Both Abdullah and Naseem, who was one of the unlucky few who suffered from long Covid, are also unshaken about their belief in the vaccine. “Vaccination saved us. Our sorrow is that even our son would have been alive, if the government policy then allowed vaccination for all age groups,” added Naseem. According to WHO, all infections that occur among fully vaccinated people after 15 days of the second jab are considered breakthrough infections. In Kerala, about one-fourth of daily new cases are breakthrough infections, with figures touching 30% on some days. Even as doctors treating Covid patients in Kerala point out that a majority of breakthrough case are largely asymptomatic or have mild-moderate symptoms, they admit that there are a few who end up with severe diseases (with rare exceptions), especially among the elderly who have less robust immune systems. But even their chance of recovery are much higher than the unvaccinated elderly. Vinod Mathew, a businessman from Koodaranji in Kozhikode district, says four of his double vaccinated family members tested positive for Covid. “While my wife and I had mild symptoms and recovered soon, my 79-year-old father, who is a heart patient and has diabetes, developed fever, while my 74-year-old mother, who is taking treatment for rheumatic arthritis, felt very weak. They were admitted to a Covid hospital for almost a week and received monoclonal antibodies. They have both recovered,” said Mathew, who is 49. Ajith Kumar Pillai, deputy marketing manager, Thyrocare, knew that extensive official travel across several states and interactions with people who were not vaccinated and didn’t wear masks would increase his potential risk of catching Covid despite the fact that he had got Covid once and been double vaccinated, but he tried not to dwell on that. He was in Bengaluru in August when he woke up feeling like he had been “hit by a truck,” with severe cough, lack of appetite and no taste. Soon he started vomiting, along with diarrhea. He tested positive for coronavirus. “Unlike the first time when I was infected and had only lost my sense of taste, this time it was a scary experience. It took me more than 18 days to recover and even now I have wheezing issues,” added Ajith. Recently, TOI had reported of a 28-year-old healthcare worker from Pune getting Covid despite an infection and two jabs but such cases are quite rare. In contrast, healthcare worker Shilly Joseph recollects that the first time she had Covid in December 2020, a month before vaccines were introduced in India, she took more than a month to recover and had trouble climbing stairs. But when she had a breakthrough infection, her symptoms lasted a few days and within a week she was back at work. “Vaccines didn’t protect me from getting infected but ensured that my symptoms were mild and I recovered fast,” said 41-year-old Shilly. Healthcare workers in Kerala seem to be the most vulnerable to breakthrough infections. “As far as reports of reinfections go, healthcare workers seem to be at a much higher risk possibly due to the high exposure environments. However, there have not been any systematic studies on this yet,” said Dr Vinod Scaria, who has co-authored a paper on breakthrough infection in healthcare workers. Dr Cyriac Abby Philips from the Liver Institute, Rajagiri Hospital, Kochi was another frontline person who got a breakthrough. “I got infected from an unvaccinated, very sick Covid patient of mine who was admitted in the hospital for some time. But because I was vaccinated, had mild symptoms and after a week’s rest, got back to work without any discomfort,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/what-does-a-breakthrough-feel-like-kerala-patients-tell-their-stories/articleshow/87232717.cms||Preetu Nair

Stakeholders in the tourism sector attribute the poor demand for tourist taxis to travellers preferring their own vehicles and app-based aggregators and reduction in organised tours. Till 2019, at least 40,000 taxi cars and maxi cabs used to ferry tourists across attractions in Tamil Nadu, about 50%of these vehicles were running in Chennai and its neighbourhood. Now, the traction for tourist vehicles is from hotels and marriage parties. Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India general secretary Afzal said the demand for taxis and maxi cabs will increase only after international travellers come in. “Tourists flying down to Chennai for domestic tourism mostly prefer app-based cab aggregators to commute,” he said. V K T Balan, president of Tamil Nadu Tour Travel and Hospitality Association, sought help from the state government and the Union government. “An extension for another year must be given to pay loan EMIs as they were struggling due to adverse impact of Covid-19,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/domestic-tourism-revives-in-tamil-nadu-but-tourist-taxis-yet-to-get-back-on-road/articleshow/87232740.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||HC notice to Karnataka govt on gaming law||BENGALURU: The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2021, which seeks to regulate online gaming has been challenged in the high court. While issuing notice to the state government and Bengaluru commissioner of police, Justice Krishna S Dixit directed petitions to be listed on October 27. The All India Gaming Federation and others challenged the legislation, saying they were surprised by the state government banning online games for skill being played for stakes. They contend that the Amendment Act is manifestly arbitrary and vague. Games of skill don’t fall under wagering and betting: PetitionersThey argued that games of skill do not fall within the ambit of “wagering and betting” as sought to be defined in the new legislation. “The state government does not have the legislative competence to enact the Amending Act. Entry 34 of List II of the Constitution of India empowers the state government to legislate only with respect to “betting and gambling” and that this entry does not extend to legislating on games of skill” the petitioners stated. According to them, the definition of ‘place’ has been expanded to include virtual platforms, mobile apps and the internet and the state has to control them as well as communication devices, electronic applications, software, online gaming and computer resources. Highlighting the amendment’s impact, petitioners added gaming has now been defined to include online games and surreptitiously extends it even to games of skill played for stakes. “The explanation now defines wagering and betting to include any act of risking money on a game of skill by persons playing such game or by a third party. As explained on the floor of the assembly by the chief minister, the amendment permits playing of chess but criminalises playing of chess for profit, money or otherwise,” petitioners pointed out. The Amending Act was passed by the assembly on September 21, 2021, and by the council on September 23, 2021. The governor gave his assent on October 4, 2021, and it was notified and brought into force on October 5, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-notice-to-karnataka-govt-on-gaming-law/articleshow/87232749.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||In Haryana's Ellenabad, villagers survive on drinking water from Rajasthan||GUSAINWALA (SIRSA): Rajasthan, the home of the Thar desert, has been providing drinking water to several villages falling under the Ellenabad assembly constituency of Haryana’s Sirsa district. TOI visited some of these villages including Gusainwala, Kagdana, Kumharia and Jorkian, located on the Rajasthan border and found that the main concern of the people still is to get adequate drinking water - almost every household has a ‘Kund’ (underground water tank) in which they store water purchased from the water tankers coming from Rajasthan. However, no candidate contesting the Ellenabad bypoll has mentioned this basic problem of the lack of drinking water in these villages in their poll promises. Drinking water is being sold in these villages after sellers get it from the Khachwana water distributary located around two kilometres from Haryana’s boundary in Sirsa district. Villagers pay up to Rs 1,000 per tankerThe villagers have to shell out around Rs 500 for one water tanker and this amount increases up to Rs 1,000 at the peak of the summer season.“I am married in this village for the past 45 years and the only difference I noticed during the past fourand-a-half decades is that we have shifted from drinking the water derived from the village’s pond to this purchased water stored in these underground Kunds,” said Maya Devi, 62, of Gusainwala village. She said none of the political parties unfortunately has shown any interest in resolving the drinking water problem and all those contesting polls only for “Moochon ki ladai” (fight for their egos) and nobody ever paid attention to these basic issues. Rajbir Singh Khod, who lives in a small hamlet located in his fields in the area falling in Rajasthan’s territory, just adjacent to the Gusainwala village, said that he has been supplying water from Rajasthan to these villages. “Although I try to charge as little as possible from these villagers, because of the high price of diesel, the major portion of the amount received from villagers for the sale of water is spent on fuel only. We really don’t want to earn money this way but cannot stop it because of villagers' demand,” he added. Atma Ram, another villager said that they are depending on Rajasthan because the canal on the Haryana side is at the tail end and it hardly supplies water 5-6 days in a month. Haryana is considered as a water affluent state but the Rajasthan canal is full all the time and caters to the needs of this area. Mohammad Mustkeem, of Kagdana village, said considering the problem of water, the then Haryana government in 2002 had completed the Gigorani minor to supply water to these villages. However, because of the problem of land levelling, the water is unable to reach these villages. “Although a boosting station has been installed near Kheri village, things are still not working out. Drinking water is the basic requirement of every household and only a strong political will can resolve the water problem of the villages,” Mustkeem added. Water from RajasthanWater tankers bring between 5,000 and 7,000 litres of water from Rajasthan and sell it to some of the villages of the Ellenabad constituency. The water is stored by the villagers in underground water tanks called Kunds. Thereafter they use it for a long time for drinking. Almost every house, even those constructed in congested areas, has built these Kunds to store drinking water.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/in-haryanas-ellenabad-villagers-survive-on-drinking-water-from-rajasthan/articleshow/87232672.cms||Ajay Sura
