The joint venture firm will see the deployment of OneWeb's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation to provide connectivity to enable Neom's ecosystem of cognitive technologies. Neom Tech and Digital Holding Company is the first holding company to be established as a subsidiary of Neom, a region in Saudi Arabia. The middle east nation is building up the Neom region in the northwest part of the country on the Red Sea as a living lab that will focus on development of the latest technologies. Neom Tech and Digital Holding Company and OneWeb, the only licensed operator in Saudi Arabia, expect to complete ground infrastructure in 2022. "Neom Tech and Digital Holding Co. and the new JV entity will have exclusive rights to distribute OneWeb services in its target regions for seven years from the initiation of the LEO satellite network, which is expected to commence in 2023," the statement said. The agreement also includes a long-term strategic partnership regarding research and development of future connectivity systems. "It is a great pleasure to witness the signing of the joint venture between Neom and OneWeb, which is a testament to Saudi Arabia's promising future in the space technology sector. Today's agreement will contribute to economic growth and accelerate digital and communications knowledge transfer to the Kingdom through the transformative Neom vision," Khalid Al Falih, Minister of Investment, Saudi Arabia said in the statement. India's Bharti Group, UK government, Softbank, Hughes and Eutelsat are stakeholders in OneWeb. "This agreement will help realise our joint vision of boosting connectivity in Saudi Arabia, Middle-East and East Africa. It exemplifies the model through which OneWeb's services will reach unconnected or poorly connected regions – through cooperation with international governments and local partners," Oneweb executive chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said. In 2020, OneWeb was acquired by the UK government and the Bharti group. The UK government and Bharti Global invested $500 million each in the company last year. In January 2021, SoftBank and Hughes returned as equity investors with an additional $400 million investment. In April, Eutelsat made $550 million equity investment in the company for a 24 per cent stake.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharti-backed-oneweb-neom-tech-form-200-million-jv-for-satellite-network/articleshow/87289161.cms||---

The Maharaja will be adding its highly popular US nonstops from next month as Uncle Sam reopens for fully vaccinated foreign travellers stating November 8. It currently has 23 weekly flights to America. "We are adding three more weekly flights, between Mumbai and Newark, from second week of November. We are awaiting normal flight operation clearance from US airports. So AI will have 26 weekly flights, a number that could have been much higher if we had more Boeing 777s available and had so many of them not been down with maintenance issues," said officials, adding that out of 16 B777s, nine are available for operations at the moment. A severe paucity of funds has seen several AI planes grounded due to spare issues. Getting the existing fleet, or newly leased planes, up in the air to mount more flights will be crucial for the Tatas to cash in on the reopening of travel. An airline insider said AI is awaiting "achche din" with the Tatas taking over. "Hopefully with Tatas getting in board, our days of slow/no/bad decision making will be over. As a PSU decision making is much slower due to clearances required. Private airline owners have in pre-pandemic times been known to order planes on SMS during board meetings," said an insider. AI is the biggest operator of nonstops between India and the US, followed by United. American Airlines is starting flights here this week. Delta has not yet indicated when it will resume India flights. Before the second wave this summer, AI had about 40 weekly US nonstops. The number fell to about 10 at the peak of the second wave and the number started rising with the student admission season this fall. "AI nonstops to US offer double baggage allowance in economy class. Where they lack is in onboard passenger experience. Tackle that and the Tatas have a winner at hand," said a pilot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-to-add-us-nonstops-post-nov-8-uncle-sam-reopening-for-fully-jabbed/articleshow/87288915.cms||Saurabh Sinha

As per the police, the fire broke out due to a short circuit. Two fire tenders were immediately rushed to the spot. Some cars were parked in the parking area and some families living in the apartment were stranded. The fire could have caused serious damage if it had engulfed the parked cars there, police said.

The slain teenagers have been identified as Ankit Kumar (19) of Shahpur Pipra in Sampatchak and Manish Kumar (18) of Harnichak in Phulwarisharif, both in Patna. The bike belonged to Ankit who was riding it. He had picked up Manish. Both were going to attend a coaching class in Boring road. Both of them, in critically injured condition, kept lying for almost half an hour at the accident spot, as per police. It was a morning walker who spotted them lying in pool of blood and informed Gardanibagh police station SHO Arun Kumar. Till that time, it had become 6 am. SHO said the accident probably took place at around 5.30am and there are no eye witnesses to it. SHO said such was the force of impact that Manish, who was riding pillion, was swung several feet in air and had fell below the bridge. The SHO said that a patrolling vehicle responded immediately after getting information. “Ankit had died till then at the spot. Manish was found alive and was rushed to private hospital with fractured legs. He was later shifted to PMCH looking at his critical condition but could not survive,” he said. Gandhi Maidan Traffic police station SHO Ashok Kumar said that both youths were not wearing any helmets. He suspected that Ankit probably lost balance at high speed due to which they rammed into the bridge sidewalls. “However, Manish’s family members have alleged in the FIR that a four-wheeler had dashed their bike from behind. The FIR has been lodged on basis of the statement of Manish’s uncle Santosh Kumar,” he said. Kumar said that looking at the bike, it seems that it rammed the sidewalls of the bridge at a high speed which resulted in both the deaths. He said that both bodies were handed over to family post mortem and further investigations are going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-teenagers-killed-in-bike-accident-on-chitkohra-road-over-bridge/articleshow/87286572.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||German co gets interim injunction against sale of generic diabetes drug||MUMBAI: MNC firm Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) has obtained two separate interim injunctions restraining generic companies, Dr Reddy’s and MSN Labs from launching or selling their respective versions of anti-diabetes drug, Empagliflozin, in the country. The two companies recently launched low-priced versions of the popular anti-diabetes drug. Boehringer Ingelheim holds a valid patent for Empagliflozin, marketed as Jardiance, in India until 2025. "Boehringer Ingelheim has obtained two separate orders granting ad-interim injunction that restrains the two domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers from launching, making, using, offering for sale, selling, importing and / or exporting their respective generic version of Empagliflozin drugs. These orders have been passed based on the prima facie satisfaction of the strength of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent and on the patent infringement by the two domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. Our faith in the Indian Patent system and the enforcement of patent rights is re-affirmed with this ad-interim injunction,” a company spokesperson told TOI. India being the diabetic capital of the world with over 77 million people suffering from Type 2 diabetes, the generic version will minimize the cost burden on patients, and in turn improve compliance, a company statement from MSN Labs earlier said. It added that the company has developed the active pharmaceutical iIngredient (API) and finished dosage formulation of EMPAONE at its in-house state-of-the-art R&D centre. The development is fully indigenous right from conceptualization to API development and FDF. Further, it is understood that Dr Reddy’s has filed a patent revocation petition before the Delhi high court on October 16 to challenge the validity of BI’s patent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/german-co-gets-interim-injunction-against-sale-of-generic-diabetes-drug/articleshow/87289747.cms||---

---||World||Dismissed: Germany's Merkel becomes caretaker chancellor||BERLIN: Angela Merkel took a step closer to political retirement Tuesday after receiving her formal dismissal certificate from the post of chancellor after 16 years in office, though she will lead a caretaker government until her successor is sworn in. Hours earlier, Merkel attended the opening session of Germany's new parliament in Berlin, taking a seat in the VIP gallery as the recently elected lawmakers met for the first time. Merkel, who first won a seat in the Bundestag 31 years ago, did not run again in the September 26 election. Lawmakers elected Baerbal Bas, a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party, as speaker of the 736-member lower house. She succeeds Wolfgang Schaeuble, a 79-year-old conservative and former finance and interior minister, who was also the longest-serving member of the last parliament, having first been elected in 1972. Bas, whose party narrowly beat Merkel's center-right Union bloc, has been a member of the Bundestag since 2009. The 53-year-old was a deputy leader of her party's parliamentary group in the last parliament and its spokesperson on health, education and research. Bas told fellow lawmakers that she would work for fairer representation of women in parliament. She is only the third woman to head the Bundestag since its creation in 1949. "The responsibility has by far not been spread fairly on all shoulders," she said. While the Bundestag has more female members following last month's election, women are still a long way from reaching parity in the national legislature. More than a third, or 34.7%, of the new lawmakers are women compared to 31.4% in the previous parliament, according to the German news agency dpa. Bas emphasised that even though parliament does not yet reflect the full diversity of German society, the new Bundestag has become more diverse, with more immigrant lawmakers and younger members. She vowed to protect the lower house against hatred and promised, "I will defend democracy against its enemies." The three parties that hope to form Germany's new government said last week they aim to have the country's next chancellor in place in early December, but acknowledged that they face a complex task. The Social Democrats, environmentalist Greens and pro-business Free Democrats opened formal coalition talks following a preliminary deal earlier this month, which set out their priorities but left many open questions. German coalition talks are an elaborate affair, producing an agreement that sets out details of the government's program for its four-year term. They have tended to get longer over the years as the country's political landscape has fragmented, meaning that elections rarely produce parliamentary majorities for traditional allies. If the negotiations succeed, the new government will send Merkel's center-right Union bloc into opposition after 16 years at the helm. Her likely successor would be Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, her vice chancellor and finance minister since 2018. Handing Merkel her dismissal certificate, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier thanked her for steering the country through difficult times, particularly during her final four-year term. He cited the coronavirus pandemic, Britain's departure from the European Union and a U.S. government under President Donald Trump that he said "had little to no interest in the international order and trans-Atlantic partnership." Merkel last week received a warm farewell from fellow European Union leaders and former U.S. President Barack Obama. Her final weeks as caretaker include representing Germany as the G-20 meeting in Italy and next week's U.N. climate conference in Glasgow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/dismissed-germanys-merkel-becomes-caretaker-chancellor/articleshow/87289775.cms||---
---||Delhi||With smaller venues and shorter guest lists, Diwali card parties return in NCR||This season stands synonymous with shopping, celebrations, card parties and pre-Diwali bashes in Delhi. But those who especially look forward to the latter have been quite disappointed for the last one year as the opulent, grand Diwali parties went missing due to the pandemic. However, this year Diwali card parties are back. Though the gatherings are much smaller and an athome thing now, card parties in Delhi remain as happening and flashy as ever. Revenge celebrations for NCRAfter revenge travel, revenge dining and revenge shopping, revenge celebrations is the latest fad. “I have 19-20 invites for each day for parties happening across NCR. This started last week, and the number of invites will go up in the coming week,” says restaurateur Varun Duggal, who has been attending Diwali parties regularly since last week. He adds, “It seems that everyone was waiting to have a Diwali party. After attending so many Diwali parties, I have noticed that these parties are mostly being organised at homes or farmhouses, rather than hotels or banquet halls, as would happen in the previous years. Though the number of guests is limited, there is no compromise on the budget. People are spending a lot of money on décor, food, etc.” Fashion designer Vandy Mehra decided to host two card parties this festive season. One was a Karwa Chauth-cum-Diwali card party for her girl gang, and the other will be a few days before Diwali for other friends and family. “I usually host this annual party, but last year we could not because of the pandemic. This year as the situation is getting better, I feel we also need some celebrations back in life. So we decided to host two parties this festive season. The idea was to have friends and family over and spend some quality time,” said Vandy. Delhiites are going all out to celebrate the return of cards parties after a year Demand for gourmet meal boxes and fully vaccinated catering staffAs gatherings become smaller at Diwali parties, hosts are very particular about the catering staff and their vaccination status to ensure safety. “Most hosts are checking about the vaccination status of the staff while making the reservation. Like we do in our restaurants, we are also making our catering staff wear badges that read ‘I am vaccinated’. Also, we try and send limited staff to these parties. For most parties (with a guest list of around 40- 60 guests), we prefer sending two members from the catering staff,” says Varun Khera, the owner of a restaurant in Noida, which is also catering for Diwali parties. Gourmet meal boxes that come packed with sanitised cutlery are also in demand this year. “The reason why many hosts are asking for these gourmet boxes is that they think they will be hassle-free and they want to enjoy a safe dining experience rather than have some staff over for food. Some invite catering staff only for live counters. We have noticed that most hosts prefer meal boxes if the gathering has up to 100 people. We have around 70-80 reservations (for meal boxes and catering) per week for Diwali parties across NCR,” says Gaurav Mehta, founder of a catering company in Delhi. A recent Diwali party in Greater Kailash II Card-themed desserts are a hit at Diwali partiesWhen we talk about Diwali parties, it is obvious that the dessert section has to be elaborate, but this year, people are looking for innovative options, too. “One change that I have noticed this year is an increase in the demand for card-themed desserts, along with other dessert selections. There is a lot of demand for card-themed cupcakes, cakes, macarons and other bite-sized desserts. Diwali parties, which are happening this year, might have fewer guests attending them, but people are definitely spending big to make these parties impressive. I have around 20-25 orders for such desserts for each week till Diwali,” informs Aavika Chhawchharia, cofounder of an NCR-based bakery and catering service.

The atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture pulled in from the Pacific, capped a series of back-to-back storm systems that abruptly switched the state’s immediate emergency concerns from wildfires to flooding. But the long-term problem of a drought that scientists say is part of a warming and drying trend driven by climate change was not washed away. “One storm this early in the water year does not predict the rest of the winter storm season,” state climatologist Michael Anderson said in a statement. “After this system we see a period of dry conditions return to California.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 2021 winter forecast shows the probability of precipitation in California to be significantly below average while temperatures run well above average. And the state is already running a water deficit. During normal years, the winter snowpack in the Sierra Nevada supplies about 30% of water statewide when the spring melt comes and water runs off to be captured in the state’s system of reservoirs. Winters, however, have not been normal lately. Last April 1, the date when the snowpack is typically at its deepest and contains the greatest amount of water, the state Department of Water Resources’ system of electronic monitors found it was only 59% of average. Then, in a stunning development, about 80% of the predicted runoff never appeared. Soils were so dry and temperatures so warm that the water instead was soaked up or evaporated, and reservoir water storage fell to shocking levels. One of those huge reservoirs, Lake Oroville, has risen more than 20 feet (6 meters) since the series of storms began last week, but the Department of Water Resources website showed it was at just 27% of capacity Tuesday. The early season storms were beneficial but officials say much more rain is needed. “We have much less accumulated precipitation over the past few years than we should normally receive and the soils are particularly dry — we cannot fix this condition with one storm,” Anderson said. The northern Sierra generally received 2-20 inches (5-51 centimeters) of snow, with a few sites reporting more, but snow depth dropped to 1-2 inches (2.5-5 centimeters) in the central Sierra and just a trace fell in the southern end of the range, according to the department. Even before the rains, the pace of California wildfires that have burned nearly 3,900 square miles (10,100 square kilometers) this year was slowing and then the wet weather pushed several of the remaining huge blazes to 100% containment. In Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, the lightning-sparked KNP Complex fire was 69% contained after receiving several inches of rain and snow. Firefighters sheltered in place Monday and on Tuesday supervisors were to assess conditions. “When safety permits, the crews will reengage the fire,” a situation report said. Most of this year’s major fires have occurred in now-saturated Northern California. In Southern California, however, the fire season typically begins in fall, when the region’s powerful, dry Santa Ana winds blow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-still-deep-in-drought-despite-atmospheric-river/articleshow/87291202.cms||---

A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted unanimously with one abstention that the vaccine’s benefits in preventing Covif-19 in that age group outweigh any potential risks — including a heart-related side effect that’s been very rare in teens and young adults who get a much higher dose. The FDA isn’t bound by the panel’s recommendation and is expected to make its own decision within days. If the FDA authorizes the kid-size doses, there’s still another step: Next week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have to decide whether to recommend the shots and which youngsters should get them. While children are at lower risk of severe Covid-19 than older people, 5- to 11-year-olds still have faced substantial illness -- including over 8,300 hospitalizations reported, about a third requiring intensive care, and nearly 100 deaths. The dose for young children is just one-third of the Pfizer shot already recommended for everyone 12 and older. Moderna also is studying its vaccine for young children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fda-advisers-back-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-for-young-kids/articleshow/87291281.cms||---

The Centre has asked the states and UTs to speed up the vaccination drive with focus on the second doses. The direction came against the backdrop of the country achieving the milestone of administering 100 crore vaccine doses on October 21. More than 10 crore people have their second dose overdue despite a huge balance of vaccine stock available with states and UTs. More than 12.37 crore balance and unutilised doses of Covid vaccines were available with states and UTs as on Tuesday morning, according to health ministry data. The government wants to accelerate the inoculation drive as it has planned to vaccinate the entire eligible population by the end of the year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expedite-coverage-of-2nd-dose-government-to-tell-states/articleshow/87291230.cms||---

Further, the students will also be marked as overground workers (OGWs) of anti-India organisations in police records and denied all government-funded benefits in future, according to sources in the J&K government. The focus will be on identifying the “ring leaders” — such as those who might have planned and led the slogans — rather than students who got swayed by the celebrations. “The stance of the government is clear. Any evidence of extra-territorial loyalty at the cost of the Indian Union will be factored in while deciding one’s right to employment opportunities in government or other government-funded benefits. In this case, the J&K police have identified, or are in the final stages of identifying, the ring leaders behind the cheering of Pakistan’s cricket team and singing of Pakistan’s anthem on GMC and SKIMS premises,” said a J&K government functionary. Criticising the decision, former J&K chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti tweeted on Tuesday: “HM’s (home minister) Mann ki Baat with Kashmiri youth started with slapping UAPA against medical students for celebrating Pakistan’s win. Instead of trying to ascertain why educated youth choose to identify with Pakistan, GOI resorted to vindictive actions. Such steps will alienate them further”. The official said the students involved study in a government-funded medical college and avail benefits such as subsidised education and scholarships at the expense of the Indian government. “From the videos of the celebrations currently being scanned by police, it seems there were at least a dozen such students, many in their final year, in the lead,” said the functionary. The videos triggered strong outrage on social media with many questioning the actions of the students and asking why they were being funded if they could raise anti-India slogans with impunity. The functionary said the idea behind the police action was not to go after all the students — since some may have been bullied or just swept away and joined in — but the real ring leaders who are radicalised elements suspected to have “systematically” planned the pro-Pakistan show. “Initial investigations suggest these ring-leaders were allegedly going around on the campus since Sunday afternoon, declaring that they would seek ‘dua’ (say prayers) for Pakistan’s victory. There is nothing wrong in cheering for a good batsman irrespective of his nationality. But singing Pakistan’s anthem on the premises of an Indian institution is an anti-national act,” a J&K government officer said adding that the “ring leaders” will be charged under the UAPA and other sections of IPC. Sources said since the Centre and the J&K government were aiming to crack down on the “entire” terror eco-system, including overground workers and terror sympathisers, a conscious decision has been taken to identify and book the ring leaders and deny them all state benefits like government jobs or police clearance for obtaining government documents such as driving licence and passport. Since they will be listed as OGWs in police records, they will not be able to get government jobs and may find it difficult to even secure private sector employment. “In fact, they may face hardship in even securing their licence as a medical practitioner,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-slap-uapa-on-pakistan-cheerleaders-at-jk-college/articleshow/87291822.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Hundreds at Kheri rally, why only 23 eyewitnesses: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday questioned UP Police on why there were only 23 eyewitnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case when hundreds of people were present at the rally and also directed the UP government to provide protection to all of them. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli asked the state to record the statements of other witnesses before judicial magistrates and expedite the examination of digital evidence. It directed the state to file a separate status report on the death of a journalist and that of BJP worker Shyam Sunder, who was attacked by a mob of farmers. The court also asked the state to speed up the process of getting laboratory reports and also the recording of statements of eyewitnesses. As senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the UP government, informed the bench that there are 68 witnesses in the case and statements of 30 (of whom 23 are eyewitnesses) have been recorded, the bench questioned why the number of eyewitnesses is "so low" as there were hundreds of farmers at the rally. "There was a crowd of 4,000-5,000 people who were all local people and even post-incident most of them were agitating. Then the identification of these people should not be a problem," the bench said. The bench also emphasised that eyewitness evidence is always more credible. "It is always better that first-hand information and evidence is available. It is always better to have credible evidence," it said. Salve said the first ring of people close to the scene of the incident and those who saw the cars and people inside these vehicles were among the eyewitnesses. The court after perusing the report said that it is concerned about two issues - one is about the delay in getting all the reports by the state government from forensic laboratories and the second is that of protection of witnesses. It thereafter directed the state to make a request to the concerned forensic laboratories to provide all the reports to it as early as possible and also provide protection to all the witnesses. "...we further direct the state government to expedite the recording of statements of some more witnesses under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, who are relevant to be enquired about the alleged incident. If the state government feels any difficulty due to non-availability of judicial officers, we direct the concerned district judge to entrust this task of recording of statements of these witnesses to any nearest magistrate," the bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hundreds-at-kheri-rally-why-only-23-eyewitnesses-sc/articleshow/87291875.cms||---

A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi adjourned the hearing to November 10 of a petition challenging two government orders making Kannada a compulsory subject for degree students, following a request from advocate general Prabhuling K Navadgi. "With the understanding that the government will reconsider the issue, we adjourn the matter," it said. Earlier, Navadgi said people have to learn Kannada for employment purpose and they need not learn Kannada in a classical sense and he would get more instructions in the matter. However, the bench queried as to how the state government can compel a student coming from outside to learn Kannada and added that the state government has to reconsider the issue. Samskrita Bharati (Karnataka) Trust, Bengaluru, and three other institutions have filed this petition, challenging the validity of government orders dated August 7, 2021 and September 15, 2021, saying it goes against the NEP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-impose-kannada-karnataka-hc/articleshow/87291888.cms||---

Complaints against her have also been lodged with the police. A student’s parent saw her post on Monday and asked Nafisa Attaria if she supported Pakistan. She allegedly said, “Yes, I support Pakistan.” The parents objected to this and brought it to the school and media’s notice, following which Attaria was dismissed. She later apologised through a video and clarified that while watching the match her family had divided itself into two groups, and she was supporting the Pakistan team. “When Pakistan won, I updated my status and wrote we won. Later, when I started getting comments on the post, I realised the mistake and removed the post. I am an Indian and I am sorry if I have hurt the sentiments of people,” she said. On Tuesday, ABVP members barged into the school demanding action against the teacher. Subsequently, the school filed a police complaint. A complaint has also been filed by two other individuals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/udaipur/rajasthan-teacher-lauds-pak-win-sacked/articleshow/87291997.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Auto driver rescues boy missing on first day of school||BENGALURU: Around 1pm Tuesday, autorickshaw driver M Govindaraju, 51, noticed a small boy crying at the corner of Pampamahakavi Road, Chamarajpet. Govindaraju approached the boy even as a passerby asked the boy why he was crying. The boy replied, “Daddy, Daddy... mujhe daddy chahiye.” Govindaraju realised the boy, around six years old, was lost. His fatherly instincts (he has two children, including a high-school girl) kicked in. This resident of KP Agrahara in Magadi Road asked the boy where he stayed. “The boy replied he didn’t know where his house was but could show me his school. I asked him to sit in the auto and told him I’d take him to school. When he said he didn’t have money. I reassured him he didn’t have to pay,” Govindaraju told TOI. However, the boy couldn’t find his school. Govindaraju took him to at least five schools in the vicinity, but in vain. “Finally, we reached VV Puram and I decided to go to police,” Govindaraju said. At VV Puram police station, he told cops about the lost boy and they quickly alerted the control room. Having done his bit, Govindaraju left the police station. DCP (west) Sanjeev M Patil decided to carefully check with schools in Chamarajpet and surrounding areas. “We were sure the boy was from a school in this area. Police personnel were sent to all schools in and around Chamarajpet,” he said. The boy’s father, a cook from Bihar, and homemaker mother were anxiously waiting for their son near his school near Chamarajpet V Main. “It was his first day at school. In the morning, my wife and I dropped him at school. My older daughter went to pick him up by 1pm but he had gone missing,” the boy’s father Ramesh Kumar (name changed) said. By then, cops had reached the school and met the boy’s parents waiting anxiously. “We sent a message on our network that the boy’s parents had been found. Cops from police stations of VV Puram, City Market, KG Nagar and Shankarapuram had been searching everywhere for the parents.” By 5pm, the boy was reunited with his parents. Cops called Govindaraju who was near Majestic. “The joy on hearing about it cannot be expressed in words. I enjoy social service and often take patients to hospital without charging them,” he said. Cops took the school management to task for letting the boy go without a chaperone. “He had somehow walked out of the main gate with other kids around 12.30pm after class. He didn’t see his sister waiting and walked in the opposite direction for about 1km. When Govindaraju tried to help him find the school, he went in the opposite direction,” a cop said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/auto-driver-rescues-boy-6-missing-on-1st-day-of-school/articleshow/87292084.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Potholes on Tumakuru Road give a traumatic twist to trips||BENGALURU: The Tumakuru Road stretch from the down ramp of the flyover after Metro Cash & Carry to Goraguntepalya is an apology for a national highway. Riddled with potholes, the road has slowed down traffic movement. No motorist relishes the back-breaking journey that leaves one feeling rickety. A part of the stretch is whitetopped but that has not spared commuters any misery. Given the signal lights, especially at the staggered Goraguntepalya-Outer Ring Road intersection, motorists often end up taking 45 minutes to cover what is less than a two-km-long stretch. C Sandhya, a frequent commuter, said: “Something has to be done about this road. As we stand at the signal, we notice how slowly each vehicle moves. The plight of those commuting on two-wheelers is even worse. It is very difficult to navigate around the potholes, especially when it rains.” The road is one of the busiest and has a high density of vehicular movement at any time of the day. It links the state capital with most North Karnataka districts. Besides, the junction is widely used by people commuting between west and east Bengaluru. ‘Rain adds to chaos’“Goraguntepalya Junction is among the busiest junctions of the city. Many heavy goods vehicles, private ones and KSRTC buses heading to other places and entering the city, office-goers, factory workers and innumerable residents pass this junction every day. Naturally, heavy traffic flow can be seen round the clock, peak hours in particular. When such is the situation in normal days, rain and potholes add to the chaos. Had there been no potholes, vehicles would smoothly pass the junction. Due to potholes, speed is cut down drastically, causing long traffic jams,” a senior officer from Yeshwantpur traffic police told TOI. Commuters also believe that the number of accidents goes up with vehicles suddenly changing lanes to negotiate potholes. The road is also littered with gravel and asphalt shards, raising the risk of skidding for two-wheeler riders. Abhiram H, who often uses the road to reach his office, said: “The snail’s pace of traffic and the condition of the road can put one in an irritable mood first thing in the morning. I now use an alternative route to reach my place of work which is longer. I hope they fix the problems soon.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/potholes-on-tkuru-rd-give-a-traumatic-twist-to-trips/articleshow/87292086.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP sub-contractor, 4 others held with scrapped notes of Rs 80 lakh||BENGALURU: Five men, including a sub-contractor of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), were arrested for allegedly trying to sell and purchase demonetised currency recently. Police seized banned notes of face value Rs 80 lakh and colour photocopies of such currency with a total face value of around Rs 5 crore. The accused are Sureshkumar, 32, of KR Puram, and Ramakrishna, 32, of Rajajinagar, both cloth merchants; Venkatesh M, 53, of Hongasandra, a sub-contractor, and Manjunath, 43, of Anekal and Dayanand, 45, of Hongasandra, both farmers. According to police, Venkatesh, Manjunath and Dayanand had come to HBR Layout on October 10 to sell demonetised notes with a face value of Rs 45 lakh. Acting on credible information, police swooped down on the trio and arrested them the same day. Main suspects Suresh and Ramakrishna promised the trio they would help them sell demonetised notes for 35% of their face value through their contact. Believing them, the trio got ready to buy more demonetised notes from others for 20% of their face value to get profit. A police team headed by inspector C Prakash arrested Suresh and Ramakrishna and seized Rs 35 lakh in demonetised currency from them. The accused persons told police a gang based in Kasaragod, Kerala was engaged in the purchasing of demonetised notes and stored them in a farmhouse. A police team rushed to Kasaragod and raided the farmhouse. Cops found 24 sacks of colour photocopies of the notes. Police said there is no way to exchange or get legal tender against demonetised notes. Yet, a few gangs are using banned currency to lure people looking to make easy money. They promise their victims that they will help them sell demonetised currency for 35% of its face value and ask them to get such notes. The gang also manages to arrange people to sell scrapped notes for 20% of the face value to the victims. Genuine demonetised notes or their counterfeit versions are sold, but the buyers end up losing the money as the gang does not keep its promise of buying the scrapped notes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sub-contractor-4-others-held-with-scrapped-notes-of-80l/articleshow/87292087.cms||---

A private health centre in Rajagopalnagar, run by Ayush doctors without Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) licence, has been shut, said Dr Srinivasa GA, district health officer, Bengaluru Urban. The doctors are missing.He added an inspection of the Rajagopalnagar centre was done based on complaints from the public about illegal abortions and female foeticides carried out there. Officials found equipment used in abortions. Based on another complaint that a scanning centre in Dasarahalli was involved in sex determination, the team inspected it and sent notice. Its activities were suspicious as a large monitor was placed to show antenatal scanning images to pregnant women, said Dr Srinivasa. Officials said patients who were scanned at the Dasarahalli centre would be sent to the Rajagopalnagar hospital for female foeticide.In a private hospital in Yeshwantpur, the team found out that doctors from Rajasthan who were being trained in fetal medicine had not registered themselves with Karnataka Medical Council nor was the centre affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi Gandhi University of Health Sciences for running a course. “These are blatant violations. The hospital has not communicated to the department about training doctors in fetal medicine,” said Dr Srinivasa. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hosp-shut-after-female-foeticide-plaints-2-more-get-notices/articleshow/87292088.cms||---

Rao is the 12th accused in a criminal case registered pursuant to the February 5, 2005 blast in Venkatammanahalli, Pavagada taluk, Tumakuru, where eight people, mostly police personnel, were killed. Poet-singer Gaddar is another accused. The non-bailable warrant was issued by the 4th Additional District and Sessions Court, citing non-appearance. Rao is required to be secured before the court by October 28, 2021. Rao has claimed that he was granted bail on November 28, 2019 and the application seeking for recalling of the body warrant issued on July 23, 2019 was rejected by the trial court, while issuing the non-bailable warrant on October 21,2021.According to Rao, he was granted bail on medical grounds for a month by the Bombay high court in the Bhima Koregaon case, with the condition that he would not leave the jurisdiction of NIA court, Mumbai.“Therefore, non-appearance before the trial court (at Madhugiri) on October 21 was bona fide, unintentional and beyond my control,” Rao has stated in his petition, while requesting the high court to permit him for appearance through video conferencing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/varavara-rao-approaches-hc-against-warrant/articleshow/87292089.cms||---

K Dayakaran, a resident of Lingarajapura, filed a complaint stating the men barged into the office at 3pm and asked for his employer Mahesh. Mahesh met them and they discussed some matters. A little later, Mahesh went for lunch, asking the trio to wait in the office. “I was unaware of these developments. After some time, the trio came to me, asking where Mahesh was. When they asked about the payment, I told them to collect it legally in a police station. But one of them attacked me with a helmet. They rolled down the shutters and called a person identified as Babloo who threatened me. When they asked me to call my boss, I used the opportunity to alert police.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Tour firm owner held for cheating||BENGALURU: Sleuths from the Central Crime Branch have arrested the proprietor of a package tour firm on charges of illegally running chain-link business and cheating people. Prashant B, in his 40s, ran the firm ‘Royal Dreams to Fly Pvt Ltd’ with its office in Annapoorneshwarinagar, and offered to share 25% of money paid by new customers with those who introduced them. Prashant and two others were booked in November 2017 on similar charges. Then, with two more persons, Prashant owned ‘Super Royal Holidays’ with its office in Girinagar under Chandra Layout police limits. The case is pending trial. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil said they are yet to assess the number of victims and money involved. “The firm offered package tours and promised a share in profit, between 20% and 25%, for those bringing investments from new customers. This is clearly a chain-link business,” he said. In the 2017 case, the First Information Report (FIR) stated Prashant and two of his partners accepted three kinds of deposits. “They accepted deposits of Rs 11,000, Rs 22,200 and Rs 54,400. Many customers were promised a free foreign tour and other incentives for introducing others. However, they failed in fulfilling their promise,” it stated. Teacher booked for molesting minor A physical education teacher has been booked under the Pocso Act for allegedly molesting a minor girl. Dakshina Kannada police booked a case against Elias Pinto for molesting a student, who was undergoing training in sports in the college. In her complaint, the girl has alleged that on October 23, Pinto had taken her to his cabin while promising help. He had reportedly asked her to share all her problems with him and he would help her financially in case of need. Later, he molested her by touching her inappropriately behind his chamber. A case under IPC Section 354(A) and Section 8 of Pocso Act has been registered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tour-firm-owner-held-for-cheating/articleshow/87292091.cms||---

Having lost the plot of projecting development activities, the parties are now playing the caste and sympathy cards to woo voters. This was more than evident on Tuesday when chief minister Basavaraj Bommai once again toured fromvillage to village in Hangal, saying: “I’m the chief minister from your district, I’m the CM from Haveri. I shall be forever your son of this soil.” The BJP has brought its cadre from Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Mangaluru, Belagavi, Bidar, Shivamogga, and other districts to camp in Hangal. There are also designated ministers from various communities to help project their party as “inclusive” and to suggest even the Muslims are disheartened with the Congress and JD(S). The CM also held meetings with the Bhajanti, Bhovi and Lambani community members. KPCC president DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah also utilised caste-based platforms. They used the forum of Madiga community meeting of the Scheduled Caste to claim that it was the Congress that gave them a separate development board. “As the CM, I was the one who ordered social welfare minister H Anjaneya to set up Babu Jagjivan Ram Development Board for the community.

One department "clarified" that non-compliance of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order can attract action, including prison term of up to a year. The DDMA had issued an order on October 8, mandating employees in departments, autonomous bodies, PSUs, local and educational bodies under the Delhi government, to at least get the first vaccine dose by October 15. DDMA order aims at 100% vaccination among govt staff Unvaccinated employees were not allowed to attend office on October 16 and were told that the period of absence from duty till they get at least one dose, would be treated as "on leave". The decision was taken in a meeting of the DDMA on September 29, 2021, aimed at ensuring 100% vaccination of all government employees, frontline workers, healthcare workers, teachers etc, who have frequent interaction with the public. An employee's vaccination status was to be verified by the respective heads of department through a certificate of vaccination or the Arogya Setu app. "All departments have to now compile this data and see that each employees is vaccinated. That is why all departments would issue orders to ensure that the staff is aware of the need to comply with the DDMA order," a Delhi government official said. "Most government employees, however, have been vaccinated at least with one dose," he said. Departments that have issued orders in the last two weeks to branch in-charges to ensure compliance and verify vaccination certificates include labour, finance, directorate of audit, directorate of training and technical education. In its order issued on Tuesday, the directorate of training and technical education stated that it had received references seeking clarification regarding the action to be taken against officials not complying with the DDMA directions and attending office after October 15 with getting a vaccine shot. The directorate "clarified" that non-compliance with the DDMA order shall attract penal action under sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. It stated that as per section 51(b) of the Act, whoever, without reasonable cause refuses to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of central or state government under the Act can be punished with imprisonment of up to one year or fine, or both, if convicted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/unvaxxed-staff-could-face-jail-term-delhi-govt-dept/articleshow/87292269.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||World||Double jabs, negative report must to fly to US from Nov 8||NEW DELHI: Come November 8 and foreign travellers who are fully vaccinated with WHO-approved jabs and have a negative Covid report from a test taken within 72 hours of departure can enter the US. For travellers from India, it means the lifting of restrictions imposed on May 4 at the height of India's second Covid wave. The existing country-by-country restrictions will be replaced by a consistent approach worldwide under the new international air travel policy that will be effective from November 8, the US department of state said. For the purpose of allowing entry, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has accepted vaccines that are FDA approved or authorised and those with an emergency use listing from the WHO. So, the wait for those who got Covaxin continues. "Both US citizens and foreign nationals who are fully vaccinated should travel with proof of their vaccination status to provide to their airline prior to departure to the US. That proof of vaccination should be a paper or digital record issued by an official source and should include the traveller's name and date of birth, as well as the vaccine product and date(s) of administration for all doses the traveller received," the state department website said. "The entry into US by air travel of non-citizens who are non-immigrants and who are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19 is suspended and limited (with some exceptions)," a presidential proclamation said. Children under 18 are excepted from the vaccination requirement for foreign national travellers. Those between the ages of 2 and 17 are required to take a pre-departure test. If travelling with a fully vaccinated adult, an unvaccinated child can test three days prior to departure. An unvaccinated child travelling alone or with unvaccinated adults, will have to test within one day of departure, the White House said in a fact sheet. Air passengers will have to certify the validity of vaccination and testing, and confirm that their contact information is complete and accurate. Falsifying any information could result in criminal penalties and/or fines. The new system incorporates a contact tracing order to respond to Covid variants. "The order requires that airlines collect contact information for all international inbound travellers to the US - including full name, as well as a phone number, email and address at which they can be reached while staying in the US. Airlines will have to keep this information on hand and promptly turn it over to the CDC when requested," the state department website said. Fully vaccinated air travellers will continue to be required to show documentation of a pre-departure negative viral test from a sample taken within three days of travel to the US before boarding. This condition applies to all travellers, whether US citizens, lawful permanent residents, or foreign nationals. "To further strengthen protections, unvaccinated travellers - whether US citizens, LPRs, or the small number of excepted unvaccinated foreign nationals - will now need to show documentation of a negative viral test from a sample taken within one day of travel to the US," it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/double-jabs-negative-report-must-to-fly-to-us-from-nov-8/articleshow/87292278.cms||---

According to the AAR, the main reason for such a stand is that rewards would be used by the retailers for their personal consumption. While AAR rulings do not set a judicial precedent, they do have persuasive value in similar cases. During the festive season, to prop up sales, manufacturers not only provide incentives to the end consumer by way of discounts or freebies, but also offer incentives to retailers meeting set targets. Thus, manufacturers should take heed of this ruling. In this case, GRB Dairy Foods, a private company engaged in the manufacture and supply of ghee, sweets and other products, sought a ruling on whether goods and services tax (GST) paid on inputs/input services such as a trip to Dubai, gold vouchers, TV sets or air coolers purchased by it to implement the promotional scheme ‘Buy N Fly’ is eligible for ITC. To illustrate, during the promotion period, which ran for three months and applied to sales of ready-to-eat sweets & snacks, masalas, etc, if the retailer met the target, he would be eligible for the relevant reward. For example, a turnover target of Rs 50,000 would make him eligible for an LED TV. The company illustrated that it had purchased 466 LED TV sets at a cost of nearly Rs 30 lakh. The ITC on these goods would be Rs 2.7 lakh. ITC enables a taxpayer to set off the GST paid on products purchased by it against its own GST liability.GRB Dairy Foods submitted that it procured the reward items “in the course of its business” and it has a direct nexus with the business carried on by the company. “Marketing and business expansion is an indispensable activity of every company’s operation,” it stated. During the promotion period, sales increased by over 24%. The AAR bench factored in a 2018 ruling given by the Maharashtra bench in the case of Biostadt India, where ITC was held to be not available on procurement of gold coins offered under a sales promotion scheme to its customers. “The credit of taxes paid on goods/services for personal consumption is explicitly restricted… The (reward) goods and services are used by the retailers and hence are for personal consumption. Thus, the applicant company is ineligible to take input tax credit on the inward supply of these goods and services,” held the AAR bench.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-input-tax-credit-on-festive-offers-to-retailers-gst-aar/articleshow/87289425.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Lucknow||The Master With A Midas Touch||A towering personality in the world of hockey, he was a man with a Midas touch and a heart of gold. Kunwar Digvijay Singh, fondly referred to as KD Singh ‘Babu’, is not only remembered for his magical skills with the hockey stick which fetched gold in 1948 (London) and 1952 (Helsinki) Olympics but also for the unflinching dedication with which he nurtured young talent and built sports infrastructure for future generations as an administrator. “KD Singh ‘Babu’ was born in Fatehpur tehsil of Barabanki district on February 2, 1922. Besides being a hockey stalwart, he groomed about 20,000 players. He was instrumental in ensuring sports quota in jobs in various government departments. He also played a key role in the constitution of teams in various government departments and organisations from where players were selected for the national team,” said his son Vishwa Vijay Singh. “Setting up sports hostels (in Lucknow and Meerut) was one of his biggest contributions. To promote budding talent, he would organise tournaments at local and village levels and bring children from far-flung areas to hone their skills,” he recalled. Singh said his father used to take care of the education, food and lodging of children. “At times, he would eat with them so that children do not feel that they are being given poor quality food. People of his era were different. They did not discriminate between high and low, rich and poor. That is the reason why I always try to emulate my father,” he added. “Babu sahib opened stadiums in the state which were not only for hockey but for all sports. He used to say if there are sports universities abroad, why can't we have such institutions here. He opened sports colleges in Lucknow, Gorakhpur and Dehradun which were equipped with boarding facilities and proper classrooms and teachers,” he said. The Partition after India’s independence had an impact on hockey as many Muslim players migrated to Pakistan. “My father rose up to the challenge and created a strong team for the 1948 London Olympics. To demoralise the Indian team, derogatory posters like ‘Dogs are here’ were put up across London. But such tactics failed to deter India who drubbed Great Britain 4-0 to clinch gold,” he said. ‘Babu’ used to play in Dewa Mela, the festive gathering in his hometown, Barabanki. “Dewa Mela was famous for two things – mushaira (poetic meet) and hockey tournaments,” Singh recalled. “My father was a man of principles and was never ready to compromise with ethics. In his later years, he asked us not to play hockey as believed players were no longer respected. He was not ready to give in to political pressures,” Singh said. Though it is said that KD Singh ‘Babu’ died of a gunshot wound while cleaning his gun, his son believes he had ended his life as he could not bear humiliation at the hands of the then politicians and bureaucrats. “His ethics were dear to him. Former Prime Minister Late Indira Gandhi wanted to give the membership of Rajya Sabha to ‘Babu’ and include him in her cabinet as a minister. He politely told her that he was ready to do anything she wanted but would not join politics,” he said. He shared a special relationship with the doyen of Indian hockey, Major Dhyan Chand, and was also very close to hockey commentator at Doordarshan and sports journalist, Kabir Shah. Recalling her father’s association with ‘Babu’, Kabir Shah’s daughter Wajiha Shah said, “Once my father’s friends were coming to Lucknow. He wanted to receive them at the station but had no car. My father called up Babu sahib who said he had the car but no driver was available. After some time, a car honked outside our house. When my father came out, he saw Babu sahib driving the car. My father was surprised to see him. Babu sahib laughed and said, ‘Iska bhi apna hi maza hai’. People recognised him at the railway station and started requesting him for autographs. His popularity was similar to that of Sachin Tendulkar in our times.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/the-master-with-a-midas-touch/articleshow/87291103.cms||Fazal Khan

The court observed that as the crimes are punishable by less than seven years, notices should be given under 41A CrPC and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in Arnesh Kumar case should be followed. The TDP functionaries named as accused in the case moved the high court seeking to quash the FIR registered against them. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas told the court that the contents in the complaint and the remand report were not matching. While it was stated in the complaint that the inspector was there at the TDP office at 6:30 pm, the remand report filed by the investigating officer stated that he went there at 9:30 pm. Srinivas further argued that while the alleged incident happened on October 19, the complaint was lodged the next day. The delay in lodging the complaint was not justified as the complainant himself is a police officer and the alleged attack took place while performing his duties. In fact, the petitioners lodged a complaint against the same police officer alleging that he was part of the mob that vandalised the TDP office, said Srinivas. Additional public prosecutor S Dushyant Reddy countered the allegations, stating that the complaint given by the petitioners was not registered as the police had already registered an FIR in connection with the same incident. Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy asked the government pleader to submit details of the FIR registered in connection with the attack on TDP office. As the government pleader sought time, the court posted the matter for further hearing by four weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/issue-notice-under-41a-crpc-says-hc/articleshow/87287556.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Though the court was not convinced with the PIL initially and said it was not maintainable, after considering the arguments of Y Balaji, the counsel for the petitioner, it issued notices to the respondents to file counters. The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice A V Sesha Sai asked what was wrong in giving government jobs to 15,000 women and why the petitioner was aggrieved. Balaji argued that the contention of the petitioner is not about giving jobs to women but the manner in which police duties are given without following due procedure. The police recruitment board was specifically constituted for the purpose of recruiting police and giving police duties to revenue employees is illegal and against AP District Police Act, he said, adding there is a separate procedure for recruiting police which requires certain skills and physical fitness. Balaji argued that even home guards who carry out police duties are not recognised as police personnel, while grama mahila karyadarshis who are revenue employees are being recognised as police. The high court observed that if women are being given the role of police, making unequal the equal with the police, there cannot be any contention by the petitioner. The court further observed that their job is to report about issues, including civil disputes, to their higher authorities. Considering the legal aspects raised by Balaji, the court issued notices to the respondents and posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/pil-against-police-posts-under-go-59/articleshow/87288387.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The villagers who were mainly dependant on farming and labour work, have adopted new methods of income generation which includes aquaculture, poultry and vegetable cultivation. A group of 42 people from the tribal village earned Rs 1.85 lakh during the first harvest fair (mela) held on Sunday. The villagers sold 1,200 kg fish worth Rs 1.56 lakh, 120 kg poultry worth Rs 21,00 and Rs 7,500 worth of vegetables. Their efforts over the last 10 months paid off well. It is estimated that the group could earn income of about Rs 14 lakh per annum by harvesting fish, growing vegetables and poultry. The village is part of a pilot project of Navsari Gujarat Research Centre (NGRC), a remote centre of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA). ICAR-CIBA located in Chennai is a nodal centre for brackishwater aquaculture research in the country. It is responsible for brackishwater aquaculture research and livelihood development of farmers. “As part of the project, our goal was to develop a livelihood model for the tribal population. The group of villagers got assistance from us to develop the necessary infrastructure,” said Pankaj Patil, a scientist at NGRC. Kaushik Halpati, leader of the self-help group Singod Halpati Samaj Yuva Matsya Udhyog Juth, said that their lives have changed due to aquaculture in the 2 acre pond which had remained unutilized so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/navsari-tribal-villagers-take-to-aquaculture-poultry-to-earn-livelihood/articleshow/87288647.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The chief minister interacted with the students and told them about senior IAS officers who studied in residential schools and social welfare hostels. The chief minister said many IAS and IPS officers have come from economically weak backgrounds and asked the students to be inspired by their lives to reach higher positions. He also advised them to work hard, as nothing is impossible if efforts are made. Citing the example of three IAS officers—Muthyala Raju, Kantilal Dande and Sunita—the chief minister said they came from poor backgrounds but went on to become IAS officers. “You were able to reach IIT and after this, the world will open doors for you providing better opportunities. All you have to do is work hard to reach this level and you will also be seen in the seats next to me,” the chief minister said. As many as 179 students from social welfare and tribal residential schools in the state have secured seats in various IITs, preparatory courses in IITs, NITs, IIITs and other central government educational institutions.

The surge came on the back of a strong 50% growth in radio and 51% in the solutions business, the operator of India’s No.1 FM radio channel, Radio Mirchi, said on Tuesday while announcing results for the second quarter. While third-party sales and other operating income grew at a slower pace, ENIL said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (ebitda) had turned profitable during the quarter at Rs 8.9 crore due to the surge in revenues and continuing cost-control initiatives. The company’s second quarter net loss was Rs 7.9 crore, down from Rs 27.7 crore in the preceding first quarter as the impact of the second Covid wave waned. ENIL said its balance sheet remains strong with cash reserves of Rs 205.7 crore as on September 30. ENIL MD & CEO Prashant Panday said, “Thanks to more pragmatic lockdowns during the second Covid wave and rapid vaccination across the country, the economic recovery has been faster this time. This has shown up in the strong results of the company. We expect results to remain strong in the second half of the year as well.

---||Business||HR needs to promote hybrid work to retain, attract talent||The pandemic has truly brought humans to the centre for all organisations. The key priority for HR leaders now is to help their organisation frame talent-management strategies for a post-pandemic world. However, as we speak to CHROs across sectors, many of them are still grappling to fully comprehend the long-term impact of the pandemic on work, workforce and workplace. This article is a combination of views emerging from our discussions with HR leaders and the findings from The recently concluded EY Work Reimagined survey. The survey covered 16,000 respondents and 1,000+ employers and provides a definitive view of leaders globally as well as in India about the impact of the pandemic on the workplace, including their perspectives on the risks and opportunities of hybrid working. The key imperatives for HR leaders as they reframe their talent strategies: * Hybrid strategy of the future: Interestingly, many organisations, especially in the services sector, are still undecided about their return-to-office strategy. They believe that they may never go back to the 5-days-a-week work-from-office way, but are unsure of how to communicate this from a policy point of view. According to the EY survey, 61% of companies in India plan to make moderate to extensive hybrid work changes. Yet, only 46% have communicated these hybrid working plans. On the other hand, despite the overwhelming recognition of the importance of flexible working, the survey showed 39% employers want or have already asked all their employees to return to the office full time post-pandemic. HR leaders today have a key role to help organisations decide and communicate the future work model to their employees. * Changes in culture & ways of working: The pandemic resulted in an extended period of stress for businesses as well as employees. The full extent of impact on mental well-being of employees is yet to be discovered. Most leaders today are also extremely worried that many of their new hires over the last 18 months have never stepped into office and have never truly experienced the organisation’s culture. However, surprisingly, 73% employees across India feel that the culture has got better during the pandemic. As organisations embraced flexibility, accountability levels went up manifold. The increased focus on well-being has resulted in organisations aggressively promoting a better personal and professional work-life balance. During the pandemic, most organisations also used communication through multiple channels as a powerful tool to drive a feeling of connectedness in employees. This connectedness through communication has evolved as a key component of their culture.So, there is a great opportunity for HR leaders to now instil and sustain attributions like flexibility, accountability, employee well-being and strong communication as part of their culture. * Redesigning the workplace to support hybrid strategy: The office of the future is a fallout of the deliberate strategy for return to work — ‘everyone must return to office’, ‘flexible hybrid’ or ‘work from anywhere’. A large proportion of organisations across India are making extensive changes to the workplace. A higher percentage of Indian companies, compared to their global counterparts, are reducing their real estate footprint. Closing smaller offices and redesigning office layout to increase collaborative workspaces are the other key actions that organisations are taking. * Rejigging ‘hire to retire’ process for a different workforce mix: This needs a comprehensive redesign to suit the requirements of a ‘work from anywhere’ workforce. Many HR leaders anticipate that they need to promote hybrid work to retain and attract talent. HR processes will need to be redesigned to deliver the right employee experience to a high percentage of workforce comprising millennials who may be working from anywhere. Given the choice, 69% employee respondents in India would choose flexibility when they work. By comparison, 76% want flexibility in where they work. In such scenarios, fairness and equity is expected to be the top challenge, identified by 53% of employers, with many roles still requiring fixed schedules or location. * Resuming travel & employee mobility: Employers across most countries think that business travel and mobility will be adversely affected and would decrease after the pandemic. As many as 63% employers in India consciously want to decrease business travel in their workforce post-pandemic, while 81% consider mobility as an important enabler for career development. As part of their new talent strategy, employers are re-evaluating a few top line approaches, such as the number of in-person vs remote visits, reducing internal travel for company meetings, and incorporating virtual assignments for cross-border movement. However, employee sentiments around travel are rapidly improving with 90% employees in India keen to restart travel after the pandemic. This is because they see a significant impact of travel on their business and career prospects.

The outfit’s general secretary N Kannan, addressing a gathering in Salem, said the state government is hurting the faith of devotees by melting gold ornaments donated to the deities. “Many devotees may have donated ornaments after their prayers were fulfilled. The state government’s action is completely humiliating to devotees and their faith,” he said. A Santhosh Kumar, outfit’s president of Salem zone, urged the state government to prepare a list of ornaments in each temple in the state before putting its plan into motion. “There is no information of details of temple ornaments. Without such details, the government action cannot be made accountable and transparent,” he said and added that the government is yet to explain about what it is going to do with precious stones like diamonds extracted from ornaments. The outfit leaders also warned the state government that they would continue protests across the state if the government do not roll back its decision. Salem east district president M R Krishnamoorthy and more than 200 members participated in the protest in Salem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/salem/outfit-stages-protests-against-govts-plan-to-melt-temple-ornaments/articleshow/87290110.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was on October 5, 2021, that district sessions judge (Pancham), Ashutosh Mishra, had pronounced the verdict. Though the sessions court had sent the order to the HC on Tuesday, the latter summoned the entire record. According to the case, on October 23, 2014, Harmeet brutally murdered his father Jai Singh, stepmother Kulwant Kaur, sister Harjeet Kaur, her unborn child as she was pregnant and three-year-old niece by stabbing them 85 times. During investigation, police found that Harmeet feared that his father would transfer the property in the name of his stepsister, who had come there only a week ago and whose anniversary was on October 25. The sole witness, five-year-old Kamaljeet, who was also present at that night, managed to survive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-calls-for-records-submitted-in-sessions-court-on-appeal-of-man-convicted-of-killing-5-of-his-family/articleshow/87289069.cms||---

After hearing the plea, a division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik listed the matter for October 27. Earlier, the court had asked the petitioner to submit a list of such hotels, but the latter failed to do so. Following which, the court had asked the government to submit the list.

After his return to Patna from his day-long campaigning in the two poll-boun assembly constituencies, Tejashwi told media persons waiting near the airport, “The CM had addressed a meeting at Kusheshwar Asthan on Monday and spoken lies. He had talked about a school in Kusheshwar Asthan, saying that teaching was being done up to Class XII there, but it’s not true. Everything is only on paper.” “People of the two constituencies have made up their mind to make the RJD candidates victorious,” Tejashwi said, adding RJD chief Lalu Prasad will address two public meetings on Wednesday, one each in Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan. At his election meetings in the two constituencies, Tejashwi has been pointing regularly to the “appalling condition” of the roads in Kusheshwar Asthan and two other blocks of Darbhanga district. Referring to his experience on Tuesday, Tejashwi said the helipad for the landing of his helicopter was at one place and the venue for public meeting at another, which he accessed by road that was under water, broken and full of ditches. “The CM came to Kusheshwar Asthan by helicopter, gave his speech and returned. I have been requesting him to travel by road to know the actual condition of roads,” Tejashwi said at the public meeting held at the Jhajhda High School ground. Nitish, on his return to Patna after Tuesday’s campaign, said, “If they (opposition netas) do not talk about me, what will they say and how will they get the hearing from the crowd? I have told the people about the work done by our government in the last 15 years. The rest is in the hands of the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-only-speaks-lies-during-campaign-tejashwi/articleshow/87287993.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Maoists release PDS dealer’s kidnapped son in Lakhisarai||PATNA: Intensive combing operation forced the Maoists to release Deepak Prasad (24) in Kajra at around 11pm on Monday, Lakhisarai SP Sushil Kumar said on Tuesday. Deepak, the son of a PDS dealer, had been kidnapped reportedly for Rs1 crore ransom in Lakhisarai district late Saturday night. A notorious Maoist, Pramod Koda (37), was neutralized in an encounter that night, but the security forces had failed to rescue Deepak. An AK-47 rifle, more than 100 live cartridges, a hand grenade, two IEDs and detonators were recovered from his backpack later. The heavily armed Maoists had barged into the house of PDS dealer Bhagwat Prasad at Chaukara under Piri Bazaar police station area in the district and kidnapped Deepak on Saturday. The SP said security forces had taken up combing operations specially on the hills due to which they could not escape out of the district border. “Deepak saw lights of Kajra railway station and slowly came down the hills after which police located him,” he said. “We came to know from media reports and other people that the Maoists had demanded Rs1 crore ransom from Deepak’s family for his safe release. But the family did not tell the police anything about that,” he said. The SP said more than 20 suspects, including close relatives of the Maoists, were quizzed intensively. That mounted pressure on them and finally they released Deepak. Piri Bazaar police station SHO Prajesh Kumar Dubey said had the Maoists been successful in crossing the Kajra hills with Deepak, they would have crossed over to Jamui district easily. “It would have become difficult then to rescue Deepak,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/maoists-release-pds-dealers-kidnapped-son-in-lakhisarai/articleshow/87288033.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||RJD-Congress rift in Bihar just an eyewash, says Sushil Kumar Modi||PATNA: BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday said the verbal duel between RJD and Congress was just an “eyewash” and it would last only till the ensuing byelection in the state. He said the two parties can’t leave each other. Modi, who spearheaded a series of allegations against RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family in 2016 related to multi-crore fodder scam and IRCTC hotel scams, which eventually led to fall of the Mahagathbandhan government of RJD-Congress-JD(U), said Lalu’s return in Bihar would have no political dividends for the opposition. “Lalu’s return to Bihar will not have much impact on the byelection and other upcoming elections. Everybody saw that RJD didn’t use Lalu’s photographs in its posters in the assembly election last year. His presence reminds people of lawlessness, anarchy and mismanagement. In fact, NDA will be politically benefitted with Lalu’s return,” Modi told TOI on Tuesday. The former deputy CM also took a dig at Lalu on the issue of internal feud in RJD’s first family. “There is a power struggle between Lalu’s two sons – Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. His son doesn’t listen to him. Why should people listen to a person who doesn’t have control over his sons?” SuMo asked. Asked about the verbal duel between RJD and Congress, Modi said, “It is nothing but match fixing for the ensuing byelection. Congress is not there to win but to cut the votes of NDA. It has fielded a Brahmin candidate from Tarapur assembly segment and a candidate from Ravidas community at Kusheshwar Asthan. They just want to cut votes of NDA candidates from same communities and help the RJD.” He added, “The RJD and Congress will remain together in the Lok Sabha election. This is the reason why no central leader from Congress has reacted to the distasteful remark made by Lalu against their Bihar incharge Bhakta Charan Das. If Congress has any self-respect, it should officially sever ties with RJD.” Reacting to Modi’s claim, RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said, “We don’t take cognizance of daily statements made by Modi. Has he forgotten that his own party (BJP) sidelined him in 2015 assembly election? He has never been able to stand up to the stature of Laluji or Nitish Kumar. Nevertheless, RJD workers and supporters are elated over Laluji’s return.” Meanwhile, Congress MLC Prem Chand Mishra said the party’s alliance with RJD was over. “Laluji is repeatedly attacking Congress and not saying a word against BJP. No secular politics can be done in India by humiliating Congress. It will only help BJP. Our alliance with Congress is over and we will go solo in the Lok Sabha election as well.” He added, “We have taken our decision. If the BJP has guts, it can sever ties with Nitish Kumar, who had left no stones unturned in belittling PM Narendra Modi in 2015 assembly election. The PM had also raised questions on the DNA of Nitish.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rjd-congress-rift-just-an-eyewash-says-sumo/articleshow/87287887.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The increased portion will all come in the offer-for-sale (OFS) component with existing shareholders selling more of their shares. The size of the primary offering will remain unchanged at Rs 8,300 crore, while the secondary sale size will now be Rs 10,000 crore. The biggest IPO in the history of Indian capital markets so far has been that of Coal India (CIL), which raised Rs 15,475 crore in 2010. The Paytm issue, expected to hit the market next month, will see the shares of One 97 Communications (Paytm’s parent company) being listed both on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. Even before the increase in size, Paytm’s offering was the largest in India. According to sources, Paytm has decided to hike the issue size after receiving feedback that there is enough of an appetite for the company’s shares at the right price. Nearly half of the offer for sale is by Ant Financial and the remaining by Alibaba, Elevation Capital, SoftBank and other existing shareholders. Investment bankers are understood to have advised the company to offer the shares in a price band to enable price discovery. While Paytm continues to be in the red with losses of Rs 1,701 crore, the company has significantly pared this from Rs 4,230 crore in FY19 and Rs 2,942 crore in FY20. It has also significantly reduced its marketing expenses from Rs 3,408 crore in FY19 to Rs 533 crore in FY21. The company has said that it has turned contribution margin-positive. The contribution margin gives an indication of the profits made by the company from each product or service after deducting the variable component of the company’s cost. This improved from a loss of Rs 1,998 crore in FY19 to a profit of Rs 362 crore in FY21. Food delivery platform Zomato is currently valued at Rs 1,06,302 lakh crore. Based on its proposed IPO, Paytm’s valuation has been speculated at around $20 billion, or Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Paytm is positioning itself as a multi-platform payments service provider through e-wallets, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform, postpaid, credit cards, point-of-sales terminals and all-in-one QR codes. Earlier this year, BillDesk, which processes payments for e-commerce transactions, was purchased by Prosus for $4.7 billion. In its offer document, Paytm has, quoting RedSeer, said that it has a 40% share of the customer-to-merchant mobile payments market. In terms of customer-to-merchant e-wallet transactions, its share is even higher at 65-70%. Paytm Payments Bank, a joint venture between Vijay Shekhar Sharma and One 97 Communications, has issued approximately 90 lakh FASTags, with a market share of 28%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-owners-to-dilute-more-hike-ipo-size-to-rs-18300-crore/articleshow/87290235.cms||---

MGNF is a two-year long fellowship conceived to create an opportunity for young individuals to contribute to enhancing skill development at the grassroots. As part of the programme, IIM-Vizag will train 75 fellows from 14 states, who will be deputed to 75 districts in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Bihar. They will undergo two weeks of rigorous classroom training as part of their first of the academic modules (AMs). After that, they will get deputed to their allocated districts across the aforementioned three states for their four-month long district immersion module (DIMs). During the two years of their stint at IIM-V, the fellows will undergo four AMs and six DIMs in total. The two-year fellowship seeks to combine classroom sessions with an intensive field immersion at the district level to create credible plans. The programme is expected to identify barriers in raising employment, economic output, and promoting livelihoods in rural areas. Minister for education, skill development and entrepreneurship, Dharmendra Pradhan, launched the programme across nine IIMs of the country. He highlighted how the Skill India Mission under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is attaining great traction, creating livelihoods, transforming lives, and contributing to Atmanirbhar Bharat. He exhorted the fellows of the programme to play a catalytic role in strengthening the skill ecosystem at the grassroots level. IIM-Vizag director professor M Chandrasekhar said the fellows will be awarded a certificate in public policy and management by IIM-V upon successful completion of the programme. Chandrasekhar highlighted how the fellows could play a gainful and productive role as enablers of skilling and how they could realise their career aspirations with the support of IIM Visakhapatnam. Coordinator (administration) prof Neena Pandey, coordinator (academics & research) prof Amit B Chakrabarti and programme chair prof M Shameem Jawed congratulated and welcomed the participants and spoke about how the fellows could leverage the strengths and reach of IIM Visakhapatnam. In the course of their training, the fellows will work under the close supervision of state skill development missions and spend time and effort in understanding skilling challenges and gaps in the district. The fellows are expected to enrich skilling programmes by bringing in fresh thinking to local planning, execution, community interaction and outcome management.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/mgnf-rolled-out-iim-v-welcomes-cohort-of-75/articleshow/87287437.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The pandemic hit sales in 2020 as most people stayed away from bursting firecrackers due to Covid-19 restrictions. Though high input costs have pushed up prices this year by at least 15% over last year, traders are pinning their hopes on higher sales, which they anticipae may increase by at least 30%. Speaking to TOI, president of Star Fire Merchants Welfare Society, Vizag, Sayyed Siraj said they had set up over 180 retail firecracker stalls at Andhra University grounds in 2019. Business had been brisk that year but the number of retail stalls crashed to 90 in 2020 and sales were poor with most people opting not to burst firecrackers. “We are expecting over 100 firecracker stalls to come up at Andhra University grounds this year. The sale of firecrackers will commence from November 2 and each stall owner will procure around Rs 2 lakh worth of firecrackers from wholesale dealers. We are hopeful of doing some good business this year,” Siraj said. A firecracker trader Kumar said Vizag city usually sees over 300 to 350 firecrackers stalls come up at three to four locations during Diwali. “However, the number has decreased due to the pandemic. Vizagites prefer to burst more sparklers than fireworks that make a lot of noise so that we will procure firecrackers accordingly,” he added. “Diwali is a festival of lights and celebrated with sweets. Normally, we won’t burst many crackers as it causes sound and air pollution,” said M V R Lakshmi, a resident of Vizag city. “Children have been waiting for Diwali as they want to burst some firecrackers. However, we will reduce the quantity we purchase,” said D Sudhakar, a resident of MVP Colony.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/traders-hope-for-a-cracker-of-a-sale-as-covid-cases-decline/articleshow/87288467.cms||Nalla.Babu

The EOU teams, armed with search warrants, raided Prasad’s paternal residence at Samhouta village under the Sathi police station area in Bettiah and a rented flat at Kazi Mohammadpur, Muzaffarpur. This is the seventh DA case of EOU in its ongoing crackdown against illegal sand mining in the state. Prasad, who is under suspension, is a sub-inspector rank police officer. He had joined service on June 30, 2009. The cop, whose earning from salary is around Rs 60 lakh per month, had amassed excess wealth by conniving with sand smugglers in Saran, as per EOU sources. The EOU also has inputs that Prasad was laundering money by using bank accounts of several people. EOU sources said documents showing Rs 71 lakh expenditure for buying a plot had been recovered. “The plot was bought with black money. The actual value on papers is very less. Besides, Rs 2.3 lakh in cash was also recovered from Prasad’s rented flat,” a source said. Another source said at FIR stage, the SI’s total movable and immovable property was evaluated to be at Rs 49.64 lakh. Meanwhile, the EOU has also found that Prasad didn’t even touch a single penny from his salary in 2015 and 2016. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said Prasad had been found involved in laundering money. “He used different sim cards procured in the name of one Laxman Prasad and used them to interact with sand smugglers in Saran,” he said. The EOU has found a 1,725-square feet plot in the name of the SI’s wife at Chhapra Lodipur Maripur under the Kazi Mohammadpur police station area in Muzaffarpur district. The plot was bought at Rs 29.8 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/eou-unearths-assets-worth-rs-2-crore-amassed-by-saran-cop/articleshow/87288049.cms||Debashish Karmakar

These stations being installed by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) at Beltron Bhawan, Boring Road crossing, Kankarbagh bypass near the ZSI office and the BSPCB office will also monitor other parameters like PM10, PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and ozone already being done by the six air quality monitoring stations. BSPCB chairman Dr Ashok K Ghosh said the four new stations would evaluate the presence of heavy metals like arsenic, lead, nickel, tin, aluminium, barium and cadmium in the air before, during and after the Diwali festival. He said the heavy metals released to air by through bursting of firecrackers emitting colourful lights of varying wavelength are highly toxic to human health and may affect immune system, functioning of the gastrointestinal system, kidney and lungs. Studies carried out last year by the BSPCB also indicated increase of these metals in air during Diwali. The BSPCB has also decided to launch an awareness drive against fireworks through street plays to be performed by three teams at different places of the town from Wednesday till Diwali. Four mobile teams will monitor sound level from 6pm to midnight in different residential and commercial localities from October 29 to November 4. Meanwhile, the BSPCB has collected water samples from different artificial ponds created by the district administration for immersion of Durga idols and begun examining their quality on different parameters. Ghosh said the scientific investigation would reveal whether toxic substances like synthetic paints and non-degradable materials used for making or decorating the idols had any adverse effect on the water.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/four-more-air-quality-monitoring-stations-to-function-in-patna-till-nov-11/articleshow/87287937.cms||VK Tripathi

IRCTC senior public relations officer (PRO) A K Jha said the IRCTC has launched a new logo of the bus ticket booking. “Though it was launched in January on a trial basis at a few places, this project could not evoke good response during the second wave of the pandemic. However , it has started picking up now. The IRCTC has tied up with the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) and other private operators for the purpose,” Jha said. “The IRCTC is providing bus ticket booking facility service free of cost for both interstate and inside state journey. The aim is to help passengers reach their homes conveniently. Passengers reaching Patna Junction by trains during festive season can avail this facility to reach their native places in Bihar. They can book their online bus tickets on the IRCTC portal www.bus.irctc.co.in,” he said. According to Jha, the IRCTC has roped in at least 50,000 bus operators, including private operators, across the country to provide this uninterrupted facility to passengers in 22 states and three union territories. “This will be a boon for those who are not in a position to travel due to cancellation of train services at the last moment for one reason or another in Bihar,” he said, adding about 2500 passengers are availing this facility per day at different locations, including Bihar,” he said. “The IRCTC has launched this particular service on par with train and air ticket bookings for people who intend to travel with full comforts from ‘pickup to drop point’ by bus journey. The IRCTC is likely to integrate this facility by launching a mobile app soon so that passengers can book their bus tickets online through their mobile phones,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/irctc-restarts-online-booking-of-bus-tickets/articleshow/87287721.cms||Kumod Verma

Spanish infrastructure major Ferrovial, the operator for London’s Heathrow and Glasgow airports, among others globally, is investing Rs 3,180 crore in IRB Infra to buy a 24.9% stake in the company. Additionally, Singapore’s GIC is investing Rs 2,167 crore to buy a 16.9% stake. The funds will be raised through preferential offers to the two entities at a price of nearly Rs 212 per share, a company release said. IRB Infra is one of the leading road developers and toll road operators in the country. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway is one of the toll road highways that the company operates. It also has two infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) — one publicly listed and another privately placed. For the Spanish major Ferrovial, this is its first investment in India, being made through its arm Cintra INR Investments BV. GIC is the private investment firm of the government of Singapore, and is investing in IRB Infra through its arm Bricklayers Investment. After the fund infusion, promoters’ stake in the company will come down to about 34% from 58.5% now, advisers to the deal said. The funds raised from Ferrovial and GIC will be primarily used to retire IRB Infra’s debt aggregating Rs 3,250 crore. Of the balance Rs 2,097 crore, Rs 1,497 crore will be treated as growth capital, which will be used for current and future opportunities. The remaining Rs 600 crore will be used for general corporate purposes. The company also has plans to participate in the massive infrastructure development and monetisation plan of the government, the release said. “IRB Infra’s execution capabilities, Cintra’s global best practices and technical prowess coupled with GIC’s backing as a long-term investor will be a launch pad for IRB to capture unprecedented growth in a capital-efficient manner,” the release said. According to Shivam Bajaj, founder-director of Avener Capital, which was the sole adviser to IRB Infra for this fund-raising, the deal is a testimony of the stable policy regime and conducive business environment of the Indian infrastructure sector, which has perennially attracted large, patient, foreign capital from marquee global investors. “The infrastructure sector in India provides a great opportunity for new foreign infrastructure investors and operators to capitalise on the ambitious infra development plan unleashed by the government,” Bajaj said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/irb-raises-rs-5k-cr-from-spains-ferrovial-gic/articleshow/87290095.cms||---

Several people were inoculated on the first day at a camp at Ibrahimpur village in northeast Delhi’s Burari. Under the campaign, vaccines are being administered for free. Puri later sent out a tweet in Bhojpuri in which he shared pictures of the launch event and sought blessings for everyone from ‘Chhathi Maiya’. Tiwari, who has planned the vaccination drive, said that the campaign is aimed at ensuring that all eligible people who would be doing Chhath Puja are vaccinated. “Local BJP workers will be going from door to door to identify unvaccinated people and facilitate their vaccination,” said Tiwari. The drive will be carried out in all wards of the capital with focus on people who have not been jabbed yet. Over 10,000 people are targeted to be given the vaccine during the campaign. Last month, Delhi Disaster Management Authority issued an order banning Chhath Puja celebrations in public places due to the prevailing Covid situation, which triggered a protest, mainly led by Tiwari. After initially supporting the ban, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also wrote to LG Anil Baijal, who is DDMA chairman, to revoke the ban. In its meeting on Wednesday, DDMA is expected to permit the festival at public places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/spl-vax-drive-for-chhath-started/articleshow/87290155.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He also called upon the Congress to play a bigger role in national politics against the BJP. “There should be an alternative in the country. Even people of India are looking for an alternative and Congress has to play a leading role in that. It is an old all India party and we still consider them so,” Lalu told ANI. Without naming anyone, Lalu said the smaller (chhutbhaiya) leaders were responsible for the present tussle between the Congress and the RJD to save their jobs. Lalu made these statements two days after his controversial remarks on AICC in-charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, calling him “Bhakchonhar” (imprudent person). His remarks triggered a war of words between the RJD and Congress with the leaders of both the parties, barring at national level, attacking one another. Lalu, who will campaign for his party candidates in both the Kusheswar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies on Wednesday, said the RJD victory was certain and there will be ruckus (bhagdar mach jaye ga) after that. He said the RJD will then form its government in the state. The RJD chief also hit out at the NDA government for skyrocketing fuel and edible oil prices. “Diesel, petrol and everything have become expensive. Diesel is costlier than ghee. Can anyone cook without kadwa tel (mustard oil)?” he asked. Taking a jibe at the JD(U) leaders, he said, “Tejashwi has already uprooted them. Now, I will finish whatever is left.” He even took a swipe at chief minister Nitish Kumar for being projected as a prime minister material. “Let BJP and Narendra Modi handle that. So much ego and greed…..” Talking about the RJD-Congress relationship, senior JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said, “The two have love and hate relationship.” He cited several examples from the past when both the parties twisted each other’s arm when they felt the other was weak. “In 2004, when Lalu had a good number of MPs, he did not let Ram Vilas Paswan handle railways and took it himself. In 2009, when RJD had two or three MPs, Congress did not give him a ministerial berth,” said Tyagi. On Lalu’s jibe at Nitish, Tyagi said the latter was a systematic and humble political activist, who will be there for social justice. “Nitish is the product of Lalu’s misdeeds and misrule,” he said, reminding how new cars from the Patna showrooms were forcefully brought on the occasion of the wedding of Lalu’s daughter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/lalu-blames-some-chhutbhaiya-cong-leaders-for-rift-with-rjd/articleshow/87287879.cms||---

Overall, the state is third in terms of second dose compliance behind Himachal Pradesh (58%) and Jammu & Kashmir (50.8%). Out of 4.93 crore eligible population of 18+ years, the state now has 2.48 crore fully vaccinated. Gujarat is followed by Kerala. The news came on the day when the state again recorded a spike in daily cases with 30 – a 12-day high. The experts however said that the vaccination would go a long way to provide protection against severity and mortality. Analysis of the districts and municipal corporations reveal that all eight municipal corporations and 16 out of 33 districts have achieved 50% or more full vaccination targets. The highest coverage of population was recorded in Gandhinagar city at 73%, whereas the lowest was recorded in Dang at 29%. Some districts in Gujarat have lower compliance for the second doseState health department officials said that some of the districts have lower compliance for the second dose and thus districts are instructed to call up those who had taken the first dose and were due for the second. The figure is estimated to be about 30 lakh, said sources. Since October 3, the number of persons getting the second shot has surpassed those coming for the first jab – in the past week, the daily number is three to four times, said officials. The state has achieved 90% coverage of the first dose of vaccine for the eligible population.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/50-eligible-guj-popn-is-now-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/87289346.cms||Parth Shastri

The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice AV Sesha Sai observed that all the issues raised in the petition are settled in law and necessary directions would be issued. B R Naidu from Hyderabad had moved the high court seeking directions to upload FIRs and to follow Supreme Court guidelines. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, PVG Umesh Chandra told the court that as the police department filed an affidavit stating they are uploading the FIRs in AP Police website and also on the mobile app, he sought directions not to ask for personal details to download the FIRs. Umesh Chandra said while uploading the FIRs, police are asking for personal details to download the same which amounts to breach of personal privacy which is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. The high court said contentions raised in the petition are well settled in law in various cases by the Supreme Court. The court observed that this issue keeps coming to the courts in every state as guidelines in Arnesh Kumar case are not being followed. The high court reserved orders, saying appropriate directions will be given.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-reserves-order-on-uploading-firs/articleshow/87288588.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The reduced rate will be effective from October 27. The new rates will apply to customers applying for fresh loans or those who wish to transfer their existing loans including balance transfers. This is the lowest home loan rate offered by a mainstream bank ever. “We are offering 6.4% for the best category of customers with credit scores of over 800. The low-cost deposits are providing us a cushion enabling us to cut rates even further,” said Rajkiran Rai, MD & CEO, Union Bank of India. He added that the bank was working with thin margins as defaults among top-rated customers is unlikely and also the RBI assigns a lower risk-weightage to home loans, which enables banks to lend more with less capital. “Home loans have become extremely competitive, it is not just about rates. We have partnered most of the big builders for a fast turnaround of loans. We have introduced several channels for lead generating including the website and missed call banking,” said Rai. As home loans are now linked to the RBI’s repo rate, customers do not run the risk of sharp sudden increase in rates. The RBI has also allowed banks to elongate the tenure instead of hiking EMIs should its repo rate rise. Even as bond yields have started hardening, the festive season has seen a home loan rate war among banks. With credit growth this year at an anaemic 7% so far, banks are looking at growing their portfolio by pushing home loans, which are seen as low-risk advances.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-bank-home-loans-at-lowest-ever-6-4-rate/articleshow/87289963.cms||---

The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice A V Sesha Sai also asked the government why there was so much delay to complete the works. One J Balaji from Eluru had moved a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the inaction of the state government in completion of houses and delay in allotting about 85,000 houses to the beneficiaries in which works have been completed. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, Panini Somayaji told the court that the state government was not allotting the houses even after completion of works. Government pleader D Bala Swamy countered the allegation, and told the court that out of 2.68 lakh houses constructed under PMAY scheme, over 5,000 houses have been allotted to the beneficiaries and they have also taken possession. In the remaining houses, works are at various stages of competition. Contending the argument of the petitioner that 85,000 houses were completed, he said the works involve not only the house structure, but also basic infrastructure works like water, electricity and drainage facilities which need to be provided. As the works pertaining to infrastructure development are yet to be completed, the houses have not been given for possession, he added. Considering the arguments from both sides, the high court asked the state government why the works were getting delayed. The bench also directed the government to submit an affidavit stating a timeline by when all the works will be completed and possession will be given to the beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/explain-delay-in-handing-over-pmay-houses/articleshow/87287502.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The infant was sold in Bihar to one lance naik of Indian Army, Narendrakumar Ranjan, for Rs 4 lakh. Cops rounded up all seven persons involved in the child’s abduction and purchase racket. Police said that the childless couple purchased the infant from Kalpesh Rathod, who lives in Kalol. Ranjan, who had earlier served in Vadodara, knew Rathod through a common friend. For the last six months, Ranjan and Rathod were in touch as the former wanted to purchase a child as he and his wife did not have any children. This kindled greed in Rathod, who contacted Pravin Chunara and his wife Daxa, homeless couple who live under the Fatehgunj flyover bridge, to find and abduct a child and that they too would be paid their share. When the couple could not find a child in Vadodara city, Pravin contacted his friend Kalidas alias Kaliyo , who lives in Kotambi village in Waghodiya, to find a child. Kaliyo came to know recently that a child was born in his neighbouring Bhannagarpura village to a woman from the same community. Kaliyo made a plan to abduct the boy on October 20 along with his son Mahesh and a friend named Raman Rathodiya. In the wee hours of October 21, the trio abducted the infant from his house and handed him over to Pravin, who gave him to Rathod. Rathod then contacted Ranjan, who came to Vadodara and took the boy with him back to Bihar. A day after the boy was sold off, his mother approached the police and lodged a complaint of abduction at Waghodiya police station. “We left no stone unturned in finding the baby. Our teams questioned many people and worked on several theories and finally we got one lead that helped us crack the case,” said Dr Sudhir Desai, superintendent of Vadodara rural police. During questioning in Bhannagarpura village, cops learnt that a man from Kalol was looking for a child. Besides Pravin, Rathod had contacted others too, to look for a child and one of those persons led the cops to him. Rathod was picked up for questioning and he spilled the beans on the horrific tale. While Rathod kept a largest pie of the money received from Ranjan, he gave Rs 90,000 to Kaliyo and Rs 10,000 to Pravin.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Badvel campaigning winds up today, outsiders asked to leave||VIJAYAWADA: The hectic campaigning for the by-election in Badvel assembly constituency, scheduled for October 30, will end on Wednesday. The chief electoral officer has already asked the contesting candidates and political parties to stop campaigning by 5 pm. Ministers and senior leaders from the ruling YSR Congress, leaders of other parties including the BJP and Congress, would have to leave the constituency too, as the Election Commission has asked all outsiders to leave the constituency when the campaigning ends. The YSRC is projecting the welfare programmes of the state government and seeking votes. The party is confident of retaining the seat this time too with a bigger majority. The leaders are motivating voters to visit the polling booths on October 30 and cast their votes in large numbers as it would reflect on the welfare governance. The BJP, which got humiliated in the recent Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election, is confident of improving its vote share. The saffron party is facing the disadvantage of the presence of its ally — Jana Sena’s election symbol ‘Glass’ — in the ballot. As Jana Sena is not contesting, the symbol was given to Navataram Party candidate G Ramesh Kumar, who is pinning hopes on Jana Sena votes coming in his favour. Congress nominee P M Kamalamma, a former MLA from the area, is hoping to pull the votes of TDP. Meanwhile, the BJP suffered a jolt as its Kalasapadu mandal unit president, P Ramakrishna Reddy, joined the YSRC on Tuesday. Ramakrishna told reporters he decided to join YSRC to show his support to the state government’s welfare programmes. BJP state president Somu Veerraju later lodged a complaint with the Kadapa SP, alleging that Ramakrishna was kidnapped by ruling party leaders and forced to join YSRC. However, Ramakrishna said there is no truth in the allegations that he was coerced to quit BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/badvel-campaigning-winds-up-today-outsiders-asked-to-leave/articleshow/87288568.cms||---

Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said the government was committed to farmers’ welfare and was keeping its promise by crediting Rs 2,052 crore under YSR Rythu Bharosa for the third consecutive year, benefiting 50.37 lakh farmers. So far, through Rythu Bharosa alone, the government has disbursed Rs 18,777 crore, benefiting all farmers cultivating their own lands, eligible tenant farmers from BC, SC, ST and minority categories, along with those cultivating RoFR and endowment lands. Similarly, reimbursing the interest for loans taken under YSR Sunna Vaddi Panta Runalu (zero interest laons), the chief minister credited Rs 112.7 crore into the accounts of 6.67 lakh farmers. In the last two-and-a-half years, the government paid Rs 1,674 crore under YSR Sunna Vaddi Panta Runalu scheme, which includes Rs 1,180 crore arrears of the previous government.

State Congress’s former secretary Siddharth Chhatriya on Tuesday got a poster put up near the Income Tax roundabout in Patna with the message that Kusheshwar Asthan will avenge the humiliation of the Dalit community by calling Das a “Bhakchonhar”. Interestingly, Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap has found a space on the poster, along with Congress leaders. Tej had earlier extended support to the Congress in Kusheshwar Asthan. Former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar also lashed out at Lalu for using such word for Das. Meira said Lalu’s statement showed that he has not recovered fully yet and his treatment needs to continue. State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said Lalu used such slang as he was under pressure. “His sons are actually playing with his health and pressurizing him. While one is giving him mental pressure with his family drama, another is pushing him for campaign, knowing the fact that Lalu ji is not well,” said Rathorre. Even in the election rallies, Congress leaders hit out at the RJD along with the JD(U). Sharing dais in one such rally, Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav criticized the RJD for not giving Congress its share.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/congress-makes-lalus-slang-on-cong-neta-a-poll-issue/articleshow/87287963.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||Relief for Zee as HC stays EGM demand||Reeba.Zachariah@timesgroup.com Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday gave Zee Entertainment Enterprises a major relief in its 45-day feud with Invesco, its largest shareholder, as it restrained the US fund from calling a special shareholders’ meet to oust company MD Punit Goenka. Besides the removal of Goenka, Invesco wanted to induct multiple independent directors on the board of Zee. The nomination of identified individuals does not speak well of their “independence”, Justice G S Patel of the Bombay high court stated in his 44-page order, adding that Invesco’s demand to oust Goenka without proposing a replacement “puts Zee into a statutory black hole”. “Sometimes, it happens that a company must be saved from its own shareholders, however well-intentioned,” Justice Patel remarked. Invesco, which owns nearly 18% in Zee, can appeal against the order in the same forum or in the Supreme Court. Tuesday’s development comes after the Bombay high court last Thursday suggested Zee to call a special shareholders’ meet — or an extraordinary general meet (EGM) — as requested by Invesco. However, Tuesday’s favourable order follows after Zee lawyers argued that the company needs to maintain a balance between executive and independent directors on the board. Separately, Zee cancelled its Wednesday board meet for considering its second quarterly earnings of fiscal 2022 due to lack of quorum. Justice Patel observed that Goenka’s removal from Zee will cause an immediate vacancy and non-compliance. Not proposing a replacement for Goenka would result in Zee violating the Companies Act and facing liabilities. “No shareholder can be permitted to drive his company into a state of non-compliance and penalty.” Justice Patel further commented how this (removal of Goenka) is to be done without prior permission of the information and broadcasting ministry is also unclear. “I see no method of circumventing the (company’s) nomination and remuneration committee or directly proposing persons as ‘independent directors.” “It is impossible not to see the nominees of Invesco...in the Companies Act, shareholders do not get to choose individual independent directors. They may only demand that there be independent directors,” Justice Patel remarked. Zee shares ended more than 4% higher at Rs 317 by close of Tuesday’s trade on the BSE.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/relief-for-zee-as-hc-stays-egm-demand/articleshow/87289458.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Oil analysts at Goldman Sachs say that the global demand-supply mismatch, with the current demand almost near the pre-Covid levels, is expected to push up crude prices over the next year. A commensurate 30% rise in petro product prices in India would mean petrol prices could be near the Rs 150-per-litre mark and diesel Rs 140/ltr. On Tuesday, the price of petrol in the city was Rs 113.4/ltr while diesel was at Rs 104.4/ltr. “We estimate that global oil demand has surpassed 99 million barrels per day (mb/d) and will shortly hit its pre-Covid level of 100 mb/d as Asia rebounds after the Delta wave,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note. “In addition, we estimate that gas-to-oil switching may be contributing at least 1 mb/d to oil demand, with current gas forwards incentivising this through winter. While not our base-case, such persistence would pose upside risk to our $90/bbl year-end Brent price forecast.” Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that oil price was not high enough to generate demand destruction given falling energy intensity in developed markets and rising income levels in emerging markets. “Specifically, we estimate that the 2022 Brent price would need to reach $110/bbl to balance the deficit we expect through Q1 2022 via the demand side alone.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brent-crude-oil-price-may-hit-110-in-2022-goldman-sachs/articleshow/87290144.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The team collected data of the reservoir and its power generation components. They also interacted with reservoir officials on the availability of water and the discharge pattern for AP irrigation systems and power generation. The team visited the Srisailam project spillway and river sluices, the right bank and left bank power houses. On Monday, the team visited Mucchumarri, Handri-Niva and Pothireddipadu head regulator, and with the Srisailam reservoir visit, concluded their two-day visit to the state for physical verification of projects on Krishna river. The team is scheduled to make a two-day tour of projects on Krishna in Telangana before preparing a report and submitting it to the Union jal shakti ministry and the Central Water Commission. The visit was a follow-up of the Centre issuing a gazette notification to take over the irrigation projects on Krishna river in both AP and Telangana for maintenance. This decision was taken by the Union government following AP government’s request complaining that Telangana was drawing more water from the river than the allocated quantity and refusing to stop unauthorised drawing of water from the river. Meanwhile, the Telangana government has raised objections over AP’s hydel projects in Penna river base. Telangana alleged that though the hydel projects were proposed in the Penna base, water is released from Krishna at Srisailam through Pothireddipadu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/krmb-team-visits-srisailam-project-leaves-for-t/articleshow/87288651.cms||Gopi Dara

Overall cash and jewellery worth more than Rs 2.3 crore were looted in the incidents. Four unidentified armed criminals on two separate bikes looted Rs50 lakh from cooking oil wholesale trader Manoj Kumar Sah near Pahadi on New Bypass under Agamkuan police station area in Patna City when he, along with an employee on a bike, was going to deposit the cash in the PNB on Monday morning. In the second incident at around 7pm the same day, six armed criminals on three separate bikes looted 46kg of silver jewellery worth more than Rs30 lakh from Shiv Shankar Prasad Sahu near Paswan Chowk under Industrial police station area at Hajipur in Vaishali. He had purchased the items from Hathua Market in Patna and was returning to his residence at Rosera in Samastipur where he owns a jewellery shop. On October 23 night, three bike-borne armed criminals looted 3kg of gold jewellery and Rs8 lakh, which overall amounted to Rs1.5 crore, from Aditya Jewellers showroom near Anwarpur Chowk under Town police station area in Vaishali. Patna City SDPO Amit Sharan said the four criminals involved in the Rs50 lakh loot were yet to be identified. He said they had used two stolen bikes, which were recovered in abandoned condition in Pahadi locality. “The engine, chassis and registration numbers of both the bikes don’t match. The criminals had fled on foot after abandoning their bikes. Police are screening the CCTV footages to ascertain in which direction they fled,” Sharan said. He said the criminals had prior information about Sah leaving his shop with heavy cash as they had been waiting for the trader. In Vaishali, the Industrial police station SHO, Santosh Kumar, said the criminals were following Sahu from Patna. “knew that the jewellery bag was kept beneath the seat,” he said. They broke the windowpanes and attacked Sahu’s driver Sushil Poddar and staff Suresh Das to open the car gates. “The vehicle had actually slowed down due to traffic when the criminals attacked Sahu, who, along with his wife and daughter, was sitting inside. Criminals also looted the new clothes which they had purchased. The CCTV camera at Paswan Chowk was malfunctioning. Police are collecting camera footages of a nearby petrol pump,” he said. Vaishali SP Maneesh, however, said police were close to cracking the jewellery showroom loot case. “We can’t disclose anything now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/no-breakthrough-in-3-loot-cases-in-patna-and-vaishali/articleshow/87287864.cms||---

Auto analysts say with secondary aluminium imports becoming more expensive, auto companies could face a cost pinch to add to the chip shortage and steel price pressures. Global aluminium prices have more than doubled since April 2020 to over $3,000/tonne (Rs 225/kg) in October whereas domestic aluminium prices have gone up by more than 75% since April 2020 to more than Rs 245/ kg in the same period. “Significant part of this rally has come over the last 4 months where the global and domestic prices have increased by more than 20%,” said Crisil director Isha Chaudhary. JATO Dynamics president Ravi Bhatia said that, so far, the chip shortage may have got most of the attention. “But right now, it is shortage of aluminium that is going to be the real challenge. Availability of ships for material transportation adds to the problem. Given the supply constraints and logistics challenges, vehicle prices may take 16-18 months to adjust,” he said. Auto analysts say China’s power crisis has triggered a shortage of magnesium, which is a key component for aluminium alloys used to make critical auto parts like gearboxes, seats and fuel tank lids. Around 85% of magnesium comes from China and its stocks are already low in Europe and the US, triggering fears of car production being hit by this shortage as global tier-1 parts makers take a supply knock. “In order to improve fuel efficiency and make the vehicles lighter, the content of aluminium in automobiles, particularly passenger vehicles, has increased over years. It is increasingly used in engine components, alloy wheels, chassis, transmission systems, and other body parts. In the past 3 months, steel prices have cooled down to an extent, decreasing by 4%. However, aluminium prices have continued to show an increasing trend, up by 16% as of September 2021,” said India Ratings & Research associate director Shruti Saboo. Global production of aluminium has dropped since June 2021 from 5.9 million tonne to 5.5 million tonne in September, “largely driven by production curbs in China”, said Crisil’s Chaudhary. India is a net exporter of aluminium (more than 2.3 million tonne), but higher price tags mean the domestic auto industry “relies heavily on secondary aluminium imports”. Aluminium and alloys in basic raw material form account for 2%-3% of the overall production cost and a shift from secondary to primary would entail “further cost pressure as primary aluminium is 15%-25% more expensive”, she said. Global analysts are already red-flagging this new problem. Barclays analyst Amos Fletcher said in a report that around 35% of downstream demand for magnesium is auto sheet. “So, if magnesium supply stops, the entire auto industry will potentially be forced to stop.” Similarly, a report by S&P Global Platts said that Canadian metals company Matalco has informed its clients that the supply of magnesium has “dried up” and if the shortage continues it would have to cut back output of aluminium billets next year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/motowns-new-headache-aluminium/articleshow/87288833.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The ICMR has given its nod to use it at hospitals and laboratories across the country. The researchers at IIIT-Bhagalpur had started working on the project after the surge of Covid-19 patients and delay in Covid testing since March, 2020. The IIIT-Bhagalpur director, Prof Arvind Choubey, headed the research team. He told this newspaper that the ‘COVZN software technology’ is able to read the scanned chest x-ray film or plate as well as High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)/computerized tomography (CT) scan uploaded to the computer in less than one second through the software programme. “The cost of diagnosis of Covid-19 infection would be less than Rs100 through this software technology, compared to the conventional microbiological swab tests at present. It will also save two-three days or even more in getting the test results. The COVZN is able to detect tuberculosis and other complicated chest diseases too." Choubey, along with fellow assistant professor Sandip Raj, claimed that the ICMR and union ministry of health made elaborate test run before validating the innovative technology, through which precious lives, time and money of patients in diagnosing Covid-19 infection will be saved. Earlier, the ICMR had formed a high-level advisory committee headed by Dr Randeep Guleria (director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi) and experts from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to explore the ‘COVZN’ software and suggest the modalities for using it as soon as possible. “Sample testings of the technology was done in the recent past in the presence of doctors and experts at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH) in Bhagalpur, IGIMS (Patna), AIIMS and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (Delhi). The results were 94%-98% successful. Their data exhibited 98-100% result in correct diagnosis,” Choubey said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/iiit-bhagalpurs-software-for-covid-test-gets-icmr-nod/articleshow/87287787.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The price of the yellow metal hit Rs 49,900 per 10g in the Ahmedabad market on Tuesday, according to bullion traders. In just eight days, the increase per 10g has been Rs 1,000, from Rs 48,900 on October 18. “Prices are following the international rally of gold and the firming of the US dollar against the Indian rupee. Thus gold prices in India have gone up,” said a city-based bullion trader. The higher prices will affect muhurat demand on Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras, which are days of the Hindu calendar, considered auspicious for purchases of precious metals. Jewellers fear that higher prices will hurt sales, which had begun to pick up over the past three months. Gujarat reported sales of 200kg gold in a single day on Dussehra, however, according to bullion traders and jewellers, sales remained much lower than pre-pandemic times.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/festive-season-gold-prices-inching-towards-rs-50k-mark/articleshow/87289133.cms||---

---||Pune||Autorickshaw drivers rule the roost around Katraj bus depot||Pune: PMPML officials expect some relief from the autorickshaw menace, if not an end to the problem, around the Katraj bus depot utility following the crackdown on the three-wheeler drivers across the city. The drive, carried out jointly by the police and transport authorities, against the autos started after the gang-rape of a 14-year-old girl in the city. Fourteen autorickshaw drivers were among the 19 arrested for the crime. An official said Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) depot at the busy Katraj Chowk was all about chaos and disorder, primarily due to “hooliganism” of many autorickshaw drivers and also those driving six-seaters “who harass bus drivers and also assault them at times to get passengers on board”. Vijay Ranjane, manager of the PMPML’s Katraj depot, told TOI, “We had a meeting with the senior police officers a couple of days ago. The police told us to videograph the auto drivers over a period of a week. We have to send recording clips to the Bharati Vidyapeeth police, who will identify the troublemakers and take action.” Ranjane said during his stint as a depot manager in Katraj, complaints against such autorickshaw drivers to the police had been galore. “I have been with the depot for a year now and have informed the problem to the police many times. However, there has not been much change on the ground. The situation is so bad that we had to install a loudspeaker at the depot to instruct the autorickshaw drivers to move out of the facility and allow the buses to pass, pick-up and drop passengers,” he said. When TOI visited the depot, the chaos was evident. Close to 30 autorickshaws were seen parked right at the entrance of the depot, leaving no room for the buses to move in or out. The three-wheelers move only after the repeated messages on the loudspeaker or when the honking by the buses gets louder. At least five bus stops are located near the depot. But the buses cannot stop there to pick-up and drop passengers. An inspector of the Bharti Vidyapeeth police’s traffic wing said, “We are taking action against the autorickshaw drivers and we are stepping up the drive.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/autorickshaw-drivers-rule-the-roost-around-katraj-bus-depot/articleshow/87290178.cms||Joy Sengupta

The body of the boy was intact except a missing hand and injury on the head. The crocodile which had attacked the boy was found moving around in the river for two days with the boy’s body in its mouth. On Monday though they located the crocodile, they could not catch it. On Tuesday, the rescue teams surrounded the crocodile with boats and nets. But it escaped by dropping the body in the water. Forest officials said that crocodiles cannot eat their prey beneath the water. They have to come to the bank to consume it. Sometimes they hide their prey under the water and eat it after it has decomposed. Locals say tourists and some times children destroy the eggs laid by crocodiles which provokes the reptiles. Crocodiles lay eggs on the banks of the river and hide them in the sand. Children damage the eggs or take it to play. There have been instances of people killing newborn crocodiles when the mother was away. Such acts provoke crocodiles, said forest officials. The local administration and forest officials have warned of action against those who indulge in mischief like destroting crocodile eggs or killing newborn crocs. Locals and tourists have been asked not to fish or go swimming in Kali river. A crocodile park is coming up in Dandeli despite that crocodiles can be seen in the areas where human inhabitation is high.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/body-of-15-yr-old-snatched-by-croc-recovered/articleshow/87287797.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Covid: Activists to collect overcharged hospital bills to claim refund in SC||Dehradun: After filing a petition in the Supreme Court (SC) against exorbitant bill amounts charged by private hospitals during the second wave of Covid-19 earlier this year, petitioners and social activists will now run a campaign to collect copies of the bills from those affected. TOI had reported earlier this month that the apex court has sought a reply from the central government regarding Covid hospital bills. The Bench, comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna, has given 4 weeks to the Centre to reply. The group of social activists, hailing from Uttarakhand, plan to reclaim the lost money of Covid-affected families they say they've seen being overcharged. On Tuesday, they released a Whatsapp number (9870807913) and an email ID on which those who felt cheated during the course of their Covid treatment can share details. “We will share the details with the SC so that all families who lost the financial battle will get their money back. Uttarakhand’s death rate stood at 2.15% during the second wave and the state was ranked second in deaths across India. Thus, the chances of fraudulent bills and overpricing stood higher here,” said Abhinav Thapar, a Doon-based social activist and petitioner in the case. He added: “People can share the details of themselves or their known ones and send us the soft copies of their hospital bills, discharge summary, Covid report etc. We will spread the message with the help of other social activists across the state.” An amount of Rs 6 crore and Rs 3 crore have already been given back to victim families in other places such as Pune and Telangana, respectively. The petitioners, including Thapar, argued that during the pandemic, many people were admitted to private hospitals because of a lack of proper public health care systems. They said that in the absence of a clear policy or proper guidelines regarding refund of hospital bills, many patients have been plunged into poverty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/covid-activists-to-collect-overcharged-hospital-bills-to-claim-refund-in-sc/articleshow/87289126.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||India||Govt: SCs/STs job quota must be proportionate to population||NEW DELHI: Pressing its case for reservation in promotions, the Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should get the number of seats and posts in government jobs proportional to their population and discontinuing the policy will defeat the purpose of quotas. As the Supreme Court is hearing pleas of Centre and some states challenging orders of high courts which quashed their policy of reservation in promotion policy on various grounds, including for not collecting data on inadequate representation of SCs/STs employees in Centre and state jobs, attorney general K K Venugopal countered the argument saying representation would reach adequate levels if their number in the employment would be proportionate to population. "The most certain and definite way of finding out if there is inadequacy is to find out if, to implement affirmative action, which was the basis of providing for reservation, the standard laid down looking at the proportion of the SCs and STs to the population of the country or the state in question was followed. This standard would be certain and definite. "Any other yardstick would be indefinite and result in endless litigation. Not merely this, the Central government, from the inception, and the state governments of Tamil Nadu as well as Tripura, and perhaps many other state governments, having adopted this as a definite and certain basis, it would result in a chaotic state if this basis followed by the Central government is to be held to be contrary to the principle of adequacy," the AG said in his submission. Referring to Indra Sawhney judgement, the AG said that some confusion arose out of the interpretation of the verdict regarding adequate representation as it could not be be taken as proportionate representation. Venugopal in his written submission contended that the verdict was on OBC reservation and it is not applicable for SCs/STs. "It should be remembered that the proportion to the population of SCs was 15%, the STs was 7.5%, and the proportion of OBCs to the total population of the country was 52%. If the entirety of the population of all these three classes were to find seats and posts reserved in proportion to the totality of their population, what would have to be reserved is 74.5%, which would defeat the limit of 50%...," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-scs/sts-job-quota-must-be-proportionate-to-population/articleshow/87292380.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Authorities, including legal experts, clarified that there is no law putting a check on the use of habitual panch witnesses. However, it is considered unethical and raises questions on the genuineness of the case, and when pointed out during the trial, may adversely affect the prosecution’s stand. Senior criminal lawyer Nilesh Ghanekar said: “Police usually use their informers and confidantes as panch witnesses, so that it not only eases the procedure but also supports the police’s theory before the court of law.” He said that as per law, to ensure justice, panch witnesses need to be neutral and independent. But in most cases, panchs presented by the police can not be termed neutral as they already are associated with polices. Additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh told TOI, “Our policy is to utilize the local panchs and discourage the use of stock panchs.” The officer said that having the same panchs and witnesses is strongly discouraged and investigation officers have already been instructed on the similar lines. Senior police officers confide that the biggest hurdle for the police is to convince citizens with clean record to become panchs and witnesses in criminal cases. “Citizens want police and judiciary to do their job, but they don’t want to contribute by becoming panchs and witnesses,” said a visibly upset senior officer citing how he had to face challenges in making a full-proof case against a habitual criminal. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said, “We do not encourage the use of habitual panchs.” “By using habitual panch witnesses like Kiran Gosavi and Fletcher Patel, we do not want Maharashtra police to end up being embarrassed like the central agency has recently been,” said an IG rank officer, who has issued directives in his range asking the unit commanders to ensure that all the panch witnesses have a clean record, and have not been used previously. Latur SP Nikhil Pingale said, “In each sensitive case, we have asked the investigation officers to get government employees as panch witnesses.” He said even in routine cases, using informers as well as habitual panch witnesses is being discouraged, so that neutrality is maintained till the case reaches its logical end.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/sr-cops-warn-against-use-of-habitual-panch-witnesses/articleshow/87286725.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Demand stays high for fancy number plates||Pune: Despite a relative dip in the registration of two-wheelers and cars during Dasara, the road transport office said demand remained high for fancy number plates. “The number of people who opted for choice registration numbers this Dasara shot up compared to last year. Vehicle registrations might have been low, but the fact that people are spending money on fancy numbers shows that purchasing power is high,” an RTO official said, blaming the low registrations on a global shortage of semiconductor chips. As per official data, the RTO 993 receipts for fancy number plates and revenue of Rs. 94.74 lakh October 10 and 16 this year. Last Dasara, between October 17 to 26, 2020, the RTO had received just 351 receipts for fancy numbers and raked in Rs34.07 lakh. “Revenue wise, it is an increase of over 170%. While we cannot predict vehicle registrations for Diwali and Padwa festivals, the trend is encouraging and shows that if new vehicles are available, people will buy them,” another official said. A total of 3,388 two-wheelers and 1,611 cars were registered during this Dasara. Last year during the festival, 4,097 two-wheelers and 2,491 cars had been registered. Revenue wise, the RTO collected Rs 33.66 crore from registrations, this year as against Rs 33.53 crore in 2020. Every three months, the RTO auctions a series of registration numbers. Those interested need to present a demand draft for the amount they wish to spend on a number. If more than one person wants the same number, they are asked to submit another DD with a revised amount, with the number going to the highest bidder. With the shortage of semiconductor chips still ongoing, dealers said Diwali might not be very exciting in terms of business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/demand-stays-high-for-fancy-number-plates/articleshow/87290230.cms||Joy Sengupta

The squad had orders to demolish four shops which were declared illegal. While the shopkeepers alleged that they were being targeted by a local minister, the municipality said that these shops were originally given permission to operate as handcarts only. On Tuesday morning the shopkeepers told the municipal staff that they have permissions from the directorate of municipal administration giving them 15 days to approach the court and therefore their structures cannot be demolished. Chief officer (CO) of MMC had given instructions for the demolition based on the order passed by then CO Agnelo Fernandes in 2018 to seize goods from the shops. Santosh Kumar Bind, a shopkeeper said, “We have been running our shops for more than 50 years. We are paying taxes and our licences are renewed every year. This demolition order is nothing but a harassment done by the minister to please a private party who is into all sorts of anti-social activities. To flourish his activities we poor people are targeted.” Civic officials said that the handcarts over time were covered up and began to function as full-fledged shops. Vasco PI Nilesh Rane asked the municipal staff to carry on with seizure orders and to give time to the parties to approach higher authorities. MMC officers seized items from only two shops as the shop numbers of other two did not match with their data.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-authorities-face-off-with-shopkeepers-over-demolition-order/articleshow/87290325.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Fertilizers’ illegal trading may lead to artificial shortage||LUCKNOW: Even as the farmers’ protest against new farm laws continues to rage, the UP government has sounded an alarm over the possibility of fertilizer stock sneaking out of the state and across the international boundary. This could result in artificial shortage of the key agricultural ingredient—that too at the start of Rabi season. The alarming fact has come to light in a missive (dated October 24) dashed by the agriculture department to DMs of 41 districts including Saharanpur, Rampur, Bareilly, Pilibhit, GB Nagar, Ghaziabad, Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich which share a boundary with a state or Nepal. According to rules, fertilizer registration should not be provided to any private person within 5km of Nepal border. Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi has asked authorities in these districts to pick top 100 retailers and examine if fertilizers sold by them made way to farmers in the neighbouring state or across the border. He has also asked authorities to initiate legal action against retailers and persons who procure fertilizers without showing land records and engage in “illegal trading”. The measure comes less than a week after the state government initiated steps—including usage of point of sale machines after due assessment of the cultivable area of farmers—to arrest unregulated sale of fertilizers. This also comes amid stepped up procurement of phosphate fertilizers by farmers in the wake of sowing of Rabi crops like wheat, barley, peas, gram and mustard. The agriculture department has specified that fertilizer “should not” be sold to farmers in neighbouring states. Within the state, fertilizer should be provided only to farmers who show their land records. According to rules, fertilizer registration should not be provided to any private person within 5km of Nepal border. Chaturvedi said that DMs may rope in police and state investigation bureau to keep a hawk-eyed vigil on the inter-state and international border and take appropriate action against persons engaged in “illegal” trading of fertilizer. Police outposts on borders are on alert and a mobile team of officials from administration, police and agriculture is deputed to carry out raids besides other measures against unauthorised persons. Earlier this month, the agriculture department had asked the district authorities to stop wholesale stockists from hoarding fertilizers that could eventually lead to rise in their prices locally. The state government had also sought monitoring of cooperative societies and private sellers by a team of officials from the agriculture, cooperative, rural development and other connected departments. Maintain demand-supply balance: CMCM Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday pitched for easy availability of DAP fertilizer to farmers. Presiding over the team-9 meeting. Yogi asked authorities to maintain a balance between demand and supply in each district. He further directed officials to deal strictly with those who create conditions of artificial shortage of DAP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/fertilizers-illegal-trading-may-lead-to-artificial-shortage/articleshow/87291178.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 18 years on, broker convicted for filching Rs Rs 1.3 crore PF funds||MUMBAI: A magistrate court on Friday convicted the proprietor of an investment brokerage for criminal breach of trust 18 years after a cheating case was registered against him for swiping Rs 1.27 crore from a client’s employee provident fund trust. He was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 50,000. The second accused in this 2003 case is yet to be arrested. The complainant, Khusroo Burjor Captain, then 73 years old, in his statement to cops had stated that he was a director in Shapoorji Pallonji and private company limited. He was also one of the trustees of Shapoorji Pallonji employees’ provident fund trust. Captain had in July 2003 lodged a case of cheating, breach of trust, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Uday Asher, proprietor of Shree Investments. The case was investigated by the economic offences wing (EOW) and a chargesheet was filed within two months. Captain had told the police that the employees’ PF was maintained in a trust, managed by the trustees and certain employees of the company. The employees’ PF contribution, as well as company’s contribution, was deposited in a bank account and the said funds were invested in specified securities as per the provisions laid down by the central government. While investment in RBI securities were directly done by the trust, the purchase of state and central government securities was not available directly from RBI and had to be purchased through brokers in auctions. The company had for this purpose engaged Asher’s services since 1996. He used to collect cheques from the Trust on the basis of bills submitted by him, and would then deliver the securities. The cheques were issued by the trust in favour of the brokerage, Shree Investments. In April 2001, when a PF scam broke out, the trustees began enquiring about their investment. They found that securities worth over Rs 1.37 crore were undelivered by Asher. When confronted, he admitted that he had failed to deliver securities. In 2002, Asher paid the company Rs 10.3 lakh. The outstanding amount then reduced to Rs 1.27 crore. The accused had assured that he would arrange to repay the rest; that he would dispose of his property, if need be. But the management learnt that he had already mortgaged his property. This led to the FIR. There were eight witnesses and four deposed before the trial court. The trial had begun in 2017 and was completed this year. Asher was granted bail of Rs 15,000.

Dinkar Patil, chairman, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, said that if the Covid-19 situation remains the same for the next five months, the exam will definitely be held in the offline mode. “However, we will be ready for the online mode as well as plan B to ensure that students have no last-minute trouble. We cannot sit back and relax till the final decision is taken,” he said. Two national education boards, CBSE and CISCE, will conduct their semester I examinations in the offline mode in November-December. At a recent meeting with state education minister Varsha Gaikwad, stakeholders, including teachers, school representatives, task force members and education officials, rooted for offline examinations for secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) and higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) exams to be held in February-March. The members said that students should prepare for offline exams too. For the last two exams, they were assessed on internal assessments due to the pandemic situation. State board education officers present for the meeting said that the department was making preparations for the offline exams. The exams in the last year had been scheduled and later cancelled due to the rise in Covid-19 cases. A senior official from the education department said education officers had visited the Savitribai Phule Pune University recently to know how they conducted the online proctored examination. “There are over 35 lakh students taking the exam and a feasibility check on the proctored mode was done in case we have to conduct online exams,” he added. The officials had submitted a feedback during a meeting with the education minister that the online examination for so many students would be next to impossible. The tentative time table for the exam will be announced after the Diwali vacations, said Patil. A member of the committee that was part of the meeting with the minister, raised the concern of travelling especially in Mumbai where local trains are not allowed for individuals who are not vaccinated. The school education department stated that the issues was being studied.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ssc-hsc-exams-likely-in-offline-mode-in-feb-march/articleshow/87290265.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

While water has flooded buildings of some institutions, at least 10 have reported collapsed roofs. Classes have been suspended in schools that have suffered major damage, admitted officials. An official survey is underway, but senior officials in the department said more than 400 schools are expected to have suffered damage in the deluge. “We are still assessing the total number of schools that have been totally or partially damaged due to the heavy rainfall last week, but initial estimates suggest 400 buildings may be in need of repair,” said an official. “Chief education officers in each district will submit a report following which the final number will be available. The state disaster management department has also been notified,” he said, adding that school buildings that have suffered little to no damage at all are being used to house residents who have been shifted from low-lying or rain-hit areas. The official said the damage was mitigated due to the state government closing down schools ahead of a rainfall alert. Notably, Union home minister Amit Shah had said that the Centre had provided a 24-hour warning to the hill state ahead of heavy rains which helped mitigate the damage. “Schools in Nainital, Almora and Bageshwar had to bear the brunt of this year’s record-breaking monsoon,” said a primary school teacher in Nainital, the worst-hit district. Another teacher in Nainital, Kiran Sah, added that the roof of their primary school was damaged and leaking since last week. “It can cave-in anytime. The department has assured us that repair work will be initiated soon," she said. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had pegged the damage from last week’s rains to Rs 7,000 crore while adding that damages could exceed Rs 10,000 crore once a final estimate is in.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/torrential-rains-damage-over-400-govt-schools-10-report-roofs-cave-ins/articleshow/87289158.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Aurangabad||Experts demand reforms in Fee Regulatory Act||Aurangabad: While the state government has taken further steps to amend the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, experts have demanded sweeping reforms in the legislation in order to protect the interest of parents against profiteering practices by a section of schools. An official panel — formed by the school education department in February to propose amendment in the Act — began its consultation with different stakeholders on Tuesday after eight months of its constitution. Headed by joint secretary of the school education department Imtiaz Kazi, the panel invited delegations of private schools to seek their views on the proposed amendment. Claiming that the Act has remained on paper since its genesis, educational expert Prashant Sathe said the government should overhaul the legislation completely in order to give it more teeth. “As per the existing Act, a minimum of 25% parents must be aggrieved in order to raise the fee-related issue and the same limit should be brought to 10%. The existing limit gives a free-hand to schools to charge fees in an arbitrary manner,” he said. Sathe also raised the issue of divisional fee regulatory committees set up as per the Act allegedly remaining non-functional. “Such a panel in Aurangabad division was headless for years due to non-appointment of chairman. The panel could not give any relief to parents who were at the receiving end of fee-related issues during the current pandemic,” he said. Educational counsellor Vivek Velankar said the Act should spell out time-bound programme for addressing complaints at every level. “As we know, justice delayed is justice denied. It is more true in case of issues related to fees charged by schools as any lingering process beyond an academic year leaves the parents helpless,” he said. Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad and minister of state for school education Bacchu Kadu could not be reached for their comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/experts-demand-reforms-in-fee-regulatory-act/articleshow/87286733.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||One held for gang attack on house||Thiruvananthapuram: Vilappilsala police here on Tuesday arrested a 20-year-old man on charges of attacking a local CPM leader's house using explosives. The police identified the accused as Amal alias Kuttu of Aishwarya Bhavan, Chilappara near Peyad. According to the police, Amal was part of a four-member gang that hurled crude bombs at the house of CPM Vilappil area committee member Azeez at Vittiyam near Peyad on Monday evening. The gang also tried to barge into the house. The police said the attack was fuelled by personal rivalry and not politics. Azeem, the elder son of Azeez, was a history-sheeter involved in several crime cases. A month ago, he had allegedly assaulted one of the gang members. He was sent to judicial custody following that. He got out on bail on Saturday. The gang turned up at his residence learning about his release for retaliation.

---||Ahmedabad||Parking cost to accelerate in posh areas||Ahmedabad: The AMC’s new parking policy has defined high- and low-demand zones in the city based on which parking charges will be fixed. Eight zones have been identified as high-demand sites while five have been designated as low-demand zones. “The high-demand zones will have almost double the parking rates of the medium- and low-demand zones,” an AMC official said. “The areas that fall in high-demand zones include Sindhu Bhavan Road, Bopal, Satellite, and Vastrapur.” The official said other high-demand areas are the Memnagar to Ghatlodia stretch, the Gujarat University swathe including Vijay Crossroads, and the Navrangpura to Gandhigram railway station stretch on Ashram Road which falls in a commercial business district. The official said that in the eastern side of the city, areas such as Jamalpur, Raikhad, Danapith, Shah-e-Alam, Kankaria, Maninagar, Civil Hospital, and Asarwa fall in the high-demand zones. Chandola Lake, Pirana and Gyaspur have also been identified as high-demand areas. The AMC’s new parking policy was approved by the standing committee which had dropped the clause that mandated people to compulsorily furnish proof that they have parking space before buying vehicles. The draft was handed over to the state committee which approved it on October 16. “We have identified five medium-demand zones which include areas such as Chandkheda, Gota, Chandlodia, Jodhpur, Sarkhej, Anandnagar, and the Paldi to Vasna stretch,” the official said. “Other areas are Vatva, Odhav, Khodiyarnagar, Kubernagar, Sardarnagar, and Bapunagar. Here, the parking charges will be lower than in the high-demand zones.” The civic body will implement the policy in a phased manner as that is the only feasible option, said the official. He said that the AMC will carry out awareness drives through various media before and after the implementation of each phase. Two-wheeler parking added to riverfront complex Ahmedabad: The multilevel parking facility which is on the verge of completion will have space for two-wheelers as well now. Earlier, the AMC had planned this parking facility only for 1,000 cars. “We have made changes in our upcoming multilevel parking facilities,” an AMC official said. “We have added two-wheeler parking facility at the multilevel complex coming up on Sabarmati Riverfront.” The official added: “Now, apart from 1,000 cars, 152 two-wheelers can also be parked here. Depending on the demand, we may even reduce the four-wheeler capacity and increase the space for two-wheelers.” The official said that the civic body has reduced the capacity of multilevel parking complex planned on Sindhu Bhavan Road. “According to the earlier plan, the parking complex would have accommodated 943 four-wheelers and 830 two-wheelers,” the official said. “Now, the complex’s capacity has been brought down to 599 cars and 450 two-wheelers. The remaining space will be given on rent to shops and offices.” The parking complex at Danapith was to accommodate 409 cars and 222 two-wheelers. “The car capacity has been reduced to 303 now,” the official said. The upcoming multilevel parking at Chandlodia will now give room to 163 cars and 111 two-wheelers, the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/parking-cost-to-accelerate-in-posh-areas/articleshow/87289182.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Lucknow||SP back to power would mean return of extortion, anarchy, rowdyism: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday hit out at Samajwadi Party's 2022 election campaign catch line -- "Aa Raha Hun" -- saying that the slogan implied return of "anarchy, goondagardi, kidnapping, extortion and communal conflagration" in the state. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath tore into the opposition saying that they "vied for hosting Iftar parties" while putting at stake the "secular" credentials of the country that envisaged "equality for all." Terming the SP ranks as people with "criminal mind-set" who aimed to "tear the social fabric", Yogi accused them of doing politics at the cost of the country. He was speaking at the Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan organised by the BJP to consolidate the OBCs ahead of the UP elections due in the next few months, Yogi's fresh attack on SP came a day after PM Narendra Modi launched a caustic diatribe at the Akhilesh Yadav-led political outfit accusing it of corruption and halting the growth of the state. "Every section of the society, including youth, women and traders, reeled under the depravity of the previous SP dispensation," Yogi charged, maintaining that during various Hindu festivals, curfew used to be imposed during the previous SP regime. "Hum aastha ko qaid karke reh jaate they...aaj aisa nahi hai (Our faith got imprisoned. This is not the case anymore)," he said. The CM said that even when the state and the country faced the Corona pandemic, only the state government, BJP and RSS functionaries worked among the people while the opposition leaders remained largely "quarantined" in their home. "Now it is time to isolate them even in the upcoming state elections," he said, questioning if it was not the responsibility of the Congress, SP and BSP to help people in the time of crisis. He categorically accused the AAP government in Delhi of forcing natives of UP and Bihar to move out of the national capital at the peak of the pandemic. "The same political parties are speaking about doling out free sops to the people considering the upcoming state elections," he said. Yogi also took a pot shot at the opposition leaders for reaching Ayodhya and offering prayers at Ram Janambhoomi. "Pehle Bhagwan Ram ko gaali dete they... ab jab lag raha hai ki Ram ke bina nayya paar nahi honi hai to Ram Janambhoomi mein darshan karne ja rahe hain," Yogi said. His remark came on the day AAP chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal visit to Ram Lalla temple in Ayodhya a day after performing Aarti in Saryu Ghats. "Otherwise, there is not one opposition leader who didn’t curse `Babu ji' (former CM late Kalyan Singh) over the December 6, 1992 incident (when the Babri masjid was pulled down by a frenzied mob of kar sevaks)," he said. In an apparent bid to step up BJP's OBC outreach, Yogi invoked Kalyan Singh, a Lodh, calling him an "ideal Jan Nayak" who dedicated his life for `desh' (country) and `dharma' (religion). "Ye samaj (Lodh community) dharm ke liye jeene wala hai...marne, maarne wala hai...," Yogi said, The CM announced that after naming the super-speciality cancer institute in Lucknow, the state government will name the upcoming medical college in Bulandshahr in the name of Kalyan Singh. Kalyan got elected to parliament for the first time in 2004 from Bulandshahr. Yogi said that the example of governance set by Kalyan was being emulated by his government to take UP on a developmental path. He also cited the example of Avanti Bai Lodhi on whose name a new medical college in Etah was dedicated to the people by PM Modi on Monday. He said that of the three women PAC battalions, the one in Badaun, too, has been named after Veerangna Avantibai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sp-back-to-power-would-mean-return-of-extortion-anarchy-rowdyism-yogi/articleshow/87291190.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Dehradun||Bodies of 5 Bengal trekkers finally retrieved from glacier in Uttarakhand's Bageshwar district||BAGESHWAR: After five days of rescue efforts, a State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team on Tuesday recovered the bodies of five trekkers from West Bengal who had gone missing while on a trek to Sunderdhunga glacier in Bageshwar district. The dead trekkers have been identified as Pritam Roy (27), Sagar Dey (27), Chandra Shekhar Das (32) and Sarit Shekhar Das (35), all residents of Ranaghat in Nadia district of West Bengal, and Sadan Basak (63), a resident of Behala in Kolkata. While Roy was a doctor by profession, Dey was a homeopathy practitioner and Basak a retired Income Tax officer. The bodies were brought to Kapkot and taken to the nearest health facility for postmortem, said district magistrate Vineet Kumar. They were handed over to relatives, said a district official, adding that the bodies will be taken to Delhi from where they would be flown to Kolkata for the last rites. Abhijit Roy, a theatre artist from Bengal, who was in Bageshwar to take the body of his brother-in-law Sarit Shekhar Das, a music teacher, told TOI that the five trekkers were friends who often went to scale peaks together. “In 2017, they went on a trek to Pindari glacier (also in Bageshwar). They had previously trekked in Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Darjeeling,” said Roy, adding that he last spoke to Das on October 11, a day before the group embarked on the glacier trek at 4,000 metres. “He was very excited since they had to postpone the trek during the pandemic. I didn’t know this would be the last time that I speak to him…” said Roy. The wait for closure, meanwhile, continues for another family. Khilaf Singh, a tour guide from Jacuni village in Kapkot tehsil in the district, who was accompanying the team is still missing. On Monday, Singh’s brother, Anand, had met Bageshwar DM and urged the authorities to speed up the search operations. The bodies were spotted on Friday through aerial surveillance. But bad weather hampered rescue operations for several days. The rescue efforts were initiated after a porter, Harak Singh, had returned from the trek and informed the administration that his team members had been caught in a snowstorm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/2-docs-music-teacher-retd-i-t-officer-among-bengal-trekkers-found-dead-in-ukhand-hills/articleshow/87289169.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Left party workers: Transfer Pansare murder case to ATS||Kolhapur: Unhappy with the investigation into the murder of rationalist and leftist leader Govind Pansare by the state Special Investigation Team (SIT), the Left party workers have demanded the transfer of the case to the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS). The Left party workers met Kolhapur district collector Rahul Rekhawar on Monday and asked the state government, via the collector, to transfer the case to ATS. The workers have claimed that even six years after the murder, the investigation has not been concluded. They said the supplementary chargesheet filed before the Bombay high court does not mention who shot the bullets and the names of actual masterminds. The party workers, who had worked with Pansare for several years, said that the investigation should encompass the murders of other rationalists — that had taken place before and after Pansare’s murder — as well. Satishchandra Kamble, the CPI district secretary, said, “The investigation authorities have not been able to track down the perpetrators. Those arrested are getting bail. We doubt that the actual perpetrators will be nabbed if the SIT investigates the case further. Therefore, we demand that the state ATS should be roped in for a swift investigation. Six years have already passed without a major breakthrough in the case.” The HC is monitoring the SIT investigation. The officials related to the case have claimed that the final chargesheet will be filed soon, after which the trial will begin. The court has allowed the inclusion of more findings even when the case stands for trial. So far, 13 indivuduals have been arrested. Of them, Virendra Tawade and Sameer Gaikwad have received bail. The remaining suspects are either absconding or are in jail in relation to Narendra Dabholkar’s murder. The suspects are closely associated with the Goa-based Right-wing outfit Sanatan Sanstha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/left-party-workers-transfer-pansare-murder-case-to-ats/articleshow/87286743.cms||---

The incident happened on Saturday night. Fellow trekkers conveyed the news about the trio’s deaths to their family members. The three trekkers are buried under the snow, and ITBP teams are trying to retrieve their bodies. Of the deceased, Rajendra Pathak, 67, and Ashok Bhalerao, 65, were from Dombivli and Deepak Rao, 58 was from Malad. Pathak and Bhalerao were close friends since their school time, and had been trekking together for the past 45 years while Rao was well known among trekkers in Mumbai. He was also associated with YHAI (Youth Hostels Association of India), which organises trekking across the country. The trio, who were on their personal trek with a group of 13 trekkers – 12 from Maharashtra and one from Kolkata – reached Himachal Pradesh on October 16, and started their trekking on October 17 with the help of local porters and four guides from Rohru to Burua village in Kinnaur district. They were stranded in the Burua Kanda area due to heavy snowfall in the region. They are buried in the snow at a height of around 15,000 feet, fellow trekkers told family members. Dhanraj Sansare, one of trekkers who survived, told TOI, “During trekking, our assessment for snow proved wrong as suddenly the weather changed and it started snowing heavily. Somehow many of us managed to climb down, but since three trekkers were aged, they got stuck. Another trekker, Prasad Pense (57), was also stuck, He was later rescued by porters and guides. The trio shouted for help, but before the rescue team could reach there, they were buried under the snow.” Sunita Pathak wife of Rajendra Pathak, one of those who died, said, “We have heard from other trekkers that the authorities in Himachal Pradesh are trying to locate the bodies. We want the Central govrnment to provide necessary help to the Himachal authories to assist in the search operations. Already three days have passed.” Bhalerao’s son-in –law Mayuresh Rajadhyaksh told TOI, “My father-in law was actively involved in trekking and was very passionate about it. It is very unfortunate that he died during trekking”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-2-trekkers-from-dombivli-1-from-malad-killed-in-himachal-snowfall/articleshow/87291185.cms||Pradeep Gupta

---||India||8L income bar for EWS not over-inclusive, Centre tells SC||NEW DELHI: Facing questions from the SC over the rationality for fixing an income limit of Rs 8 lakh for EWS quota, which is the same for OBCs, the Centre said the determination cannot be a mathematical formula, suggesting the matter be left to the government. Stating that the criteria was on the basis of the Sinho commission report, which had in 2010 suggested that the creamy layer benchmark for OBCs be adopted for EWS, the Centre said setting different limits on the basis of cost of living and per capita income was not feasible. 'Checks in place to ensure only needy get EWS sops' Allaying the apprehension that the Rs 8 lakh limit will result in more people availing reservation benefits from the general category - which does not suffer from social and educational backwardness that are grounds for OBC reservation - and would result in over-inclusiveness, the Centre said there are other checks to ensure only needy people avail the EWS quota benefits in government jobs and admissions in educational institutions. Responding to the court's query on why the same income limit be applied across the country despite a rural-urban divide and different per capita income in different states, the government indicated that a certain subjectivity might be inevitable and said, "The determination has to be made on broad probabilities and it is impossible to achieve perfection/mathematical precision". "It is submitted that the principle of fixation of Rs 8 lakh as a criteria for determination of EWS as also for determination of creamy lawyer in the OBC category is rational and in keeping with Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. The exercise conducted to determine the creamy layer for the purpose of OBC reservation would be equally applicable for determination of EWS category since the fundamental premise is that if a person/her/his family have a substantial economic standing, s/he/ may not require the benefits of reservation at the cost of others... In any event, the office memorandum provides further exclusionary criteria," the affidavit said. "To provide further checks as to ensure that only the needy get the benefit of the reservation, the office memorandum provides further exclusions which are not applicable for determination of creamy lawyer for OBCs," the affidavit said and mentioned that a person would not be entitled to EWS quota if along with her/his family s/he owns 5 acres of land or flat of 1,000 sq ft or a residential plot of 100 sq yard or 200 sq yard in notified municipalities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8l-income-bar-for-ews-not-over-inclusive-centre-tells-sc/articleshow/87292419.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The high-stakes polling will be held on October 30. TRS, BJP and Congress are leaving no stone unturned to draw the voters in the poll, which is being seen as a semi-final to 2023 assembly elections. All the parties sent senior leaders to Huzurabad to canvass for candidates, cover all the areas and houses in the last two-three days. The election is crucial for not only TRS president and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao but also for BJP and its candidate, former minister Eatala Rajender. With the party plenary over, the ruling TRS roped in minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav for campaigning. Minister T Harish Rao has been camping in Huzurabad for close to two months and touring villages and towns in the constituency. Apart from Harish Rao, ministers Gangula Kamalakar and Koppula Eshwar are also camping in the constituency and campaigning vigorously. KCR, who was keen on defeating Eatala, used the plenary to send a direct message to voters to elect his choice, party nominee Gellu Srinivas Yadav with an assurance to implement Dalit Bandhu at all costs. The saffron party, which is eyeing an emphatic win to set the tone for the assembly polls in two years, could not get its national leaders like Amit Shah and JP Nadda to campaign for Eatala. Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy and state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar shared the maximum load by campaigning in various mandals and towns in support of Eatala, who is seeking re-election on ‘atma gouravam’ (self-pride). Congress, which fielded Balmoor Venkat, intensified campaigning by roping in Nalgonda MP and former TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy. TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy and AICC secretary incharge Manickam Tagore also canvassed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/curtains-on-campaign-today-parties-go-all-out/articleshow/87289203.cms||---

Senior officials said as there are only nine asphalt plant owners in the city, putting such a condition may not make it possible for many bidders for road repairs. Officials also said there was very little requirement of asphalt in road repairs. TIMESVIEWCartelisation in the BMC’s road repairs works is a known fact and the administration has had little success in breaking it. Unfortunately, it is deeply entrenched in the system although some tough bureaucrats over the years have tried to control it. If the BMC has decided to do away with a certain tender condition, it should ensure that the contractors are held accountable if their work is found to be of inferior quality.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said even in case of MoUs with owners of ready mix concrete (RMC), the selected bidder can get it a week after they are selected. “This will help increase competition, and if the bidder is selected, the RMC plant owner is likely to be more forthcoming for signing an MoU,” he said. Among other conditions which have been placed and which will stay are deferred payment, where 80% of payment will be released when work is completed. The remaining 20% will be released in instalments during the defect liability period. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh welcomed the move and said it was sure to make the tendering process more competitive, but the process of putting and removing conditions was only delaying road work. “This shows there were attempts to cartelise and BMC realised it and decided to do away with the condition. But this is delaying repairs, with the city clearly being victim,” he said. Former corporator and MNS party secretary Sandeep Deshpande, who had flagged off the issue, said the condition had to be done away with, as there were few contractors who have been blacklisted which have asphalt plants. “If the condition stayed, they would be back repairing Mumbai roads,” he said. Opposition party leader Ravi Raja, said BMC seemed to be working under pressure. “The condition was done away with for road repairs, but it is still applicable for trenches. It raises questions on why this special treatment has been given for work proposed by the same corporation,” said Raja. BJP MLA Ameet Satam had in a letter to the civic chief recently said that as per an RTI he had filed, BMC has spent more than Rs 21,000 crore in 24 years on making city roads but unfortunately the city continued to stay famous for its bad roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-fearing-cartelisation-of-rs-2k-crore-road-repair-work-mou-condition-scrapped/articleshow/87291224.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bullet train underground station stuck over land delay||MUMBAI: The National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL) has not been able to start work on the underground station for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet train project as it has yet to get possession of the land in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) although more than three years have passed since the state government approved the site for the project. The land pocket of 4.2 hectares (ha) at BKC was allotted by the state government to NHSRCL on February 26, 2018 , with the condition that the feasibility of the proposed International Finance and Service Centre (IFSC) should not be compromised. The state government also insisted that the cost of the land shall be adjusted against the equity contribution of the Maharashtra government. A source said, “NHSRCL has been requesting the MMRDA to hand over the BKC land since September 2020 but there is no progress.” A Railway Board official said, “NHSRCL designed the BKC station as an integrated structure (underground station with the IFSC structure above it) to take load of 60m high building above it. The tender for BKC station was proposed to be floated in November 2018. Later, the MMRDA informed about the plan to raise the height of the IFSC building to 95m, which required a change in design.” The tender of the BKC station was finally issued on November 20, 2019 with the date of submission as March 19, 2020. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and non-availability of revised design, the date of opening of the tender was extended on several occasions between May 12, 2020 and August 31, 2020. A senior official said, “NHSRCL couldn’t open thetender since the land has not been handed over by MMRDA. NHSRCL has not choice but to repeatedly reschedule the opening date of the tender. The next date of opening of tender is now December 7, 2021.” Also, a BPCL petrol pump needs to be shifted to facilitate construction of this terminal, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bullet-train-underground-stn-stuck-over-land-delay/articleshow/87291246.cms||Manthank Mehta

A total of 6,830 families will be affected in this phase.Officials said the first meeting would be held in Mundhera on November 1. After a break for Diwali, the hearings will resume on November 8 and continue till the 11th.“The schedule of the public hearings has been prepared. They will be held on November 1 and 2 and resume after Diwali celebrations from November 8. The venues and timings of these hearings would be circulated among residents of the six villages where land would be acquired,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate (land acquisition).On September 25, a six-member team constituted by Gautam Buddha University had submitted the social impact assessment report to the district administration, which sought a few more details. A revised report was submitted recently.“It was last week that the final SIA report was handed over to the district administration for further appraisal. The report has also been forwarded to the state government,” said Vivek Mishra, head of the department of political science and international relations at the university.According to the SIA report, the number of families who will have to be displaced this time is almost double of that in the first stage. In the first phase, in which 1,334 hectares were acquired, the administration had identified 3,003 families who needed to be relocated. For the second stage planned over 1,363 hectares, 5,063 families will have to be shifted, according to the SIA report. The six villages where land would be acquired are Karauli Bangar, Kureb, Mundhera, Birampur, Dayanatpur and Ranhera .Officials said houses in three of the six villages (Ranhera, Kureb and Karauli Bangar) would have to be brought down.The state government, meanwhile, is yet to respond to a request from the district administration that acquisition of abadi land should be skipped in Nagla Hukum Singh, a settlement in Karauli Bangar revenue village. Villagers in Nagla Hukum Singh have been holding panchayats on a regular basis and have threatened to boycott the public hearings and other acquisition procedures if their demand is not met.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/land-hearings-for-2nd-phase-of-airport-to-start-from-nov-1/articleshow/87291219.cms||Shalabh
---||Noida||Protesters stall work at Noida airport site over rehab demands||GREATER NOIDA: A group of villagers protesting an alleged delay in disbursement of rehabilitation and resettlement benefits stalled work on the Noida airport project in Jewar on Tuesday afternoon. The protesters flocked to the site in Rohi village, where workers under a private contractor have been putting up a boundary wall. The villagers asked the workers to stop construction, threatening them with violence if they didn’t. In the face of a backlash, the workers had little option but to stall construction and leave their earth movers and dumpers at the site itself. It was the second consecutive day that work on the project was hit. Later in the day, the group of farmers met the district magistrate at the Surajpur collectorate and submitted a list of their demands. A meeting between the protesting villagers and administrative officials was scheduled for Wednesday. “It’s not that we are putting forth any fresh demands. The government has failed to give us whatever they had promised in writing. We have been holding meetings, discussions and panchayats peacefully but have not got any response yet. So, we had no option but to stall work on the project in Rohi,” said Hansraj Singh, a farmer at the forefront of the protest. According to him, there were at least 300 families who were yet to get rehabilitation and other benefits. Officials, however, insisted that only a handful of families were left to be handed benefits in the absence of documents. “Only a few cases are left to be disposed of because of some technical issues. The land acquisition department is looking into them. We have, meanwhile, warned the villagers against taking the law in their hands. Police will be asked to initiate action if work is disrupted again,” said Rajni Kant, the sub-divisional magistrate of Jewar. While most villagers said they were yet to get rehabilitation benefits, some who have already shifted to Jewar Bangar alleged they were still fighting for basic amenities in the township that the government is building to relocate the farmers. “No identity cards have been issued to the affected families as promised. The youths who are supposed to be given jobs are still waiting for training or skill development. We are being asked to pay Rs 10,000 each for new electricity connections at the township. We were told our old connections would be transferred. There is no water supply or drainage network either. A police outpost or security arrangements seems a distant dream. All these had been promised to us,” said Singh. Officials at the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), the special purpose vehicle of the UP government for the project, said work on the civic amenities was underway. “Tenders have been floated to set up the remaining facilities. It is a matter of a few weeks. All the promised amenities will be available soon,” said an official of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), which is executing the work at the township on behalf of NIAL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/protesters-stall-work-at-noida-airport-site-over-rehab-demands/articleshow/87291237.cms||Shalabh

The Covid scenario in the division has improved a lot and out of the 36 zones, 10 are in Panchavati, eight in Nashik Road, six in Nashik East, and five each in Satpur and Nashik West divisions. An NMC official said the virus has become mild and positivity rate has also reduced to below 0.5%. This is the reason the number of active patients has also reduced significantly, leading to drop in active containment zones too. Currently, the city has only 213 active patients, including 204 patients in hospitals and remaining 9 patients under home isolation. Earlier this year, in February, there were only 500 active cases in the city but thereafter the cases started to rise exponentially. And by April-end, the number of active cases had increased to 28,000. The city had reported around 16,000 containment zones in just three months — between February and April — due to the rise in Covid positive cases. “But the trend started to reverse from the first week of May and the cases started to drop. With drop in number of new cases, the number of active containment zones declined from over 2,000 in April to 58 by the second half of September. Now, the city has reported further drop in the number of active containment zones during the last one month,” the official said. The first containment zone in the city was declared on April 6 last year and the first Covid patient was found in the city on the same day. Since then, a total 37,949 containment zones have been created, out of which 37,913 zones have been removed from the list.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/active-containment-zones-drop-to-36-in-nashik/articleshow/87286782.cms||Tushar Pawar

The party is focusing on better voter turnout in order to improve its chances in the high-pitch poll battle. With a majority of the campaign responsibilities falling on his shoulders — and the election being a matter of prestige for the BJP and candidate Eatala Rajender — Sanjay has been the party’s key campaigner aside from Rajender himself. “The campaign has heated up in the last 15 days, with Sanjay hitting out at the ruling TRS and finance minister T Harish Rao,’ said a source on the ground. “The BJP believes that voting percentage above 75% will boost the party’s chances. For every 50 votes in the constituency, one local activist has been made in charge. Their primary role is to get voters to polling booths. Sanjay’s team will be working on this till the election,” a source close to the situation said. A party leader expressed confidence of victory. “Though we have never won this seat, we are sure of winning because of the strong anti-establishment sentiment among people,” the leader said. Sanjay and his team took a stand to enhance voter turnout after the recent MLC election in Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy and Mahbubnagar graduates constituency was lost to the TRS due to low voter turnout in Mahbubnagar constituency. According to insiders, for Sanjay, as the Karimnagar MP, the election is important as it will serve as a springboard for the upcoming assembly elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/in-last-stretch-sanjay-sets-eyes-on-better-voter-turnout/articleshow/87289211.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The accused, Shaibaz Ahmed Rakhangi, had parked his bus at Dabholkar Corner — one of the busiest chowks in the city. As per traffic regulations, the private transporters are not allowed to pick up passengers from the chowk or park there. After Rakhangi was asked to move the bus by traffic policeman Ramesh Khopkar, he stepped out of the vehicle and allegedly abused the cop and manhandled him. After the altercation, a team attached with the Shahupuri police station were called to the spot. The driver was detained and booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code related to manhandling, abusing, obstructing public servant from carrying out the duty and causing inconvenience to citizens.

---||Delhi||Despite GPS, waste management is off course in Delhi||NEW DELHI: To bring transparency in its garbage collection system, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has asked waste disposal concessionaires to install GPS trackers in their vehicles and also claimed to develop a central control room to monitor the movement of these vehicles. But the exercise has still not resolved the issue as councillors continue to complain about lapses in garbage collection from the colonies with the tippers not covering the scheduled routes, not sounding the hooters etc. They demanded at the standing committee meeting on Tuesday that a system be set up to confirm the lanes in residential areas are covered and these vehicles won’t waste time. BJP councillor from RK Puram Tulsi Joshi said that there are eight tippers engaged in her ward to cover six sectors. “There is a defined route and halting points where the tippers have to wait with the hooter on so that everyone can bring their waste. But I have been receiving complaints from people that their lanes are not being covered or attended during the collection cycle or the vehicles are not honking an alert,” Joshi said. “We have been asking the sanitation department to not only share the route with councillors, but involve them the system.” AAP councillor from Sangam Vihar Jitendra Kumar said, “Sangam Vihar is a huge colony comprising three municipal wards. Except for sanitation, SDMC has no other work in the colony, but even that is not being done diligently. The tippers seldom go to all the lanes or clean the dhalao properly. And despite our several requests, not even a single fixed compacting station has been set up in the area.” Poonam Bhati, deputy standing committee chairman and councillor from Sangam Vihar, concurred with Kumar and said that there was a need to improving the collection and disposal and the monitoring setup. “People approach us in case of poor services, so ideally we should be made part of the system,” she said. An SDMC official claimed that the route was being shared with the councillors. Standing committee chairman colonel B K Oberoi (retd) claimed that sanitary inspectors regularly carried out checks on the quality of services and made sure there were no lapses. They also acted immediately on receiving complaints, he said. “The bigger garbage collection vehicles are supposed to transport a certain quantity of waste to the landfill or waste-to-energy plants every day. The contractor bears the transportation cost so there is no dilly-dallying by the drivers,’ said Oberoi. “Once the current contracts lapse in around a year, we will upgrade the system and aim at a flawless service like New Delhi Municipal Council.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/despite-gps-waste-mgmt-is-off-course/articleshow/87290312.cms||Vibha Sharma

During July and August when dengue spread was first reported, the percentage of locations to be found with larvae was around 10%. At the end of August the number dipped to under 6%. The new increase has not been sudden. The percentage of larvae breeding inspected had increased to about 10% in September. Since then health department officials have been claiming to have curbed the spread. However, the new survey report presented to the district administration is a clear warning. 44 teams took part in the survey. Out of 1366 locations surveyed in 188 locations the teams detected presence of larvae. Weather conditions, rainfall over the past two weeks has been ideal for vector borne ailments to spread. However, it comes at a time when health department, Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and other department have been instructed to curb dengue spread. Dengue has been diagnosed in over 550 people in Bhopal district this year. In the past week, around 60 new cases have been diagnosed. It has led to an added strain on health infrastructure. Bhopal has recorded dengue cases spike in 2018 and 2019. The lockdown and pandemic kept dengue under control in 2020. The fever has three stages — dengue fever, haemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. In some cases, the disease develops into a life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs, according to experts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/dengue-larvae-detected-in-13-surveyed-areas-highest-this-yr/articleshow/87289238.cms||---

The cost of two projects is pegged at Rs 245 crore, but the contractor had demanded additional Rs 45 crore more on grounds of using M60 grade cement concrete material instead of M40. After examining the issue, the NMC turned down the demand and directed the contractor to construct the flyovers at the cost that was decided initially. An NMC official said they have refused to pay additional Rs 45 crore and instructions have been given to start the works for the two bridges at the earliest. The contractor has also started initial work like soil testing before starting the construction work. “We do not need to pay the contractor for the flyover projects in this financial year, but will make adequate financial provisions for the projects in the civic budget for the financial year 2022-23,” the official said, adding the proposed flyovers will help reduce the traffic congestion on Trimbak and Untawadi roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/contractors-demand-for-more-funds-rejected/articleshow/87286806.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||After protest, Delhi University eases norms for professor interviews||NEW DELHI: A proposal to cap the number of people to be interviewed for the post of assistant professors at Delhi University (DU) came under severe criticism from a large section of teachers on Tuesday following which certain clauses were either withdrawn or altered. The proposal, part of the agenda for an executive council (EC) meeting likely to be held on Friday, was partially modified by the DU administration later in the day. The initial recommendations stated that the number of shortlisted candidates to be interviewed would be restricted. However, various teachers’ bodies called it a violation of a record of discussion dated December 5, 2019. The cap on the number of candidates has been removed for the colleges in the revised proposal. For the university departments, a minimum of 30 candidates for the first vacancy and 10 for every additional vacancy will be called, the revised agenda stated. According to the 2019 letter, “Faculty appointed and working on ad hoc, temporary or contract basis and meeting the eligibility criteria shall be shortlisted for interview in the respective university and or its colleges.” Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) said, “The (initial) proposal creates both an anomaly and an injustice. The same number of candidates will get repeated opportunities to appear in interviews till they are selected while thousands of our own incumbent ad hocs will never get a chance to appear for almost any interview.” A recommendation requiring the candidates to give presentations also triggered objections by several teachers’ bodies. Following a meeting with vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh, A K Bhagi, president of National Democratic Teachers’ Front, said, “The clause on the cap of candidates has been withdrawn for colleges. As long as they have the minimum marks, they will be called for interviews. All those getting full allowances can show their teaching experience as ad hocs. This will benefit those teaching at DU.” He added, “Such candidates also do not have to give presentations.” However, the presentation clause will stay for the DU departments. “The VC said it was important to know the field and research plans of those applying to the departments,” Bhagi said. DUTA treasurer Abha Dev Habib said, “This agenda should have been withdrawn completely. We have been demanding absorption for the longest time. Even in the revised agenda, certain clauses are in violation of the December 5, 2019 record of discussion.” Senior DU officials refused to comment before the matter was brought up at the EC meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/after-protest-du-eases-norms-for-prof-interviews/articleshow/87290345.cms||---

CMO also instructed officials that patients undergoing treatment for dengue, both in hospitals and homes, should be kept under mosquito nets. DMO, meanwhile, said with the rise in the dengue cases in Sangam city, the microbiology lab at MLN medical college was working in two shifts. Officials, however, admitted pockets of city west and city north localities are more prone to the disease. However, after witnessing a significant spike in dengue cases in city areas, officials of the health department on Tuesday took up an intensive anti-larvae spraying drive in many city pockets including Teliyarganj,Unchawagadi, Beli colony and adjoining areas.

Micro ATMs will also be installed at every PACS. A government spokesperson said that the PACS will be given financial assistance by the Centre and NABARD. "The government is of the view that digitising PACS and providing micro ATMs will benefit more than one crore farmers associated with it. They will be able to get fertilizers, seeds and crop loans easily through PACS with this move," he said. The official said that the union ministry of Cooperation has prepared a scheme for modernization and digitisation of over 97,000 PACs across the country for which a budget of about Rs 2,000-3,000 crore has been earmarked to be spent over the next five years. "PACS are village-level lending institutions based on cooperative principles, providing loans to villagers and buying agricultural produce. Many PACS are also working as gas and transport agencies while some have set up cold storage and food processing units," the official explained. 'Govt will spend 25,000 on the installation of micro ATM'Another official said that under the central government's plan, 65,000 PACS out of 97,961 will be digitized first. Around 35,000 PACS are dormant, including some in UP. Even though these societies are inactive, more cannot be set up in a gram panchayat till these are not dissolved. "The government has planned to set up PACS at village level. Currently, a PACS is formed at the level of Nyaya Panchayat. The government will spend Rs 3 lakh on the computerisation of one PACS while Rs 25,000 will be spent on the installation of a micro ATM," he said. The spokesperson said that by computerising the PACS, data of all farmers will be available online, including details about their land and bank accounts which will be linked with the district cooperative bank. Land maps of villages will also be digitised. The information available with the PACS will also contain details about which grants have been received by farmers and which schemes they have benefitted from.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/over-7400-pacs-in-state-to-be-digitised/articleshow/87291255.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Last month, 700-800 cases were being reported daily, which have now dropped to 150-200 daily. The Covid cases in the hotspot talukas like Sangamner and Parner are also dropping. More than 11,000 citizens had tested positive last month and most of them were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. The positivity rate, which was over 5% a month back, has now dropped to less than 1.9%. The number of active cases in the past one month has reduced from over 4,800 to around 2,300. Even the number of critical patients has reduced to 328, which was over 700 a month ago. District collector Rajendra Bhosale told TOI that even though the Covid scenario in the district has started improving, the administration will not lower its guard since there is a prediction of another wave and there are still active cases across the district. “For over a month now we have taken a series of measures to stop the spread of the infection. These measures have now started yielding results,” added Bhosale. The administration had imposed strict restrictions in villages in various talukas. In these villages, all non-essential shops were shut for over a week and unnecessary movement of people was also restricted. “These restrictions were imposed in over 69 villages in different phases and the local police kept a strict vigil to prevent unnecessary movement of the locals in and outside the villages. We have also created containment zones in areas with a high number of Covid cases,” added Bhosale. The administration conducted over 15,000 Covid tests daily, which was one of the highest in the state. “The test reports were made available to the local health authorities within 24 hours so that the people who tested positive could be isolated and treated early,” the district officials added. Radhakrishna Game, the Nashik divisional commissioner, has been reviewing the Covid situation in the district at regular intervals and guiding the local administration in dealing with the issue. District civil surgeons Dr Sunil Pokharna and Dr Sandip Sangle said that the Covid situation in the district, particularly in the hotspot talukas like Sangamner, Parner etc has improved. “The taluka health officials have been asked to continue with aggressive testing as the cases need to come down further,” said the duo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/covid-situation-in-ahmednagar-improves/articleshow/87286812.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Under this initiative, free breast cancer screening will be done for 1 lakh women in Goa over a period of two years covering 50% of the age-eligible female population. The initiative was launched on Tuesday at the Goa Medical College (GMC) by health minister Vishwajit Rane. The screening will be conducted at 35 health centres across Goa along with multiple outreach camps. iBreast Exam (iBE), is a non-invasive, hand-held, fully wireless solution for breast lesion detection. In clinical studies, iBE has shown high sensitivity and specificity to detect non-palpable lesions at an early stage, read the statement by YouWeCan Foundation. All the suspected cases will be referred to GMC for further investigations as well as complete treatment while YouWeCan Foundation’s project team will facilitate training and capacity-building of the government health workers and auxiliary nurse midwives to screen for breast cancer using iBreast device. Training will also be conducted for counsellors and IEC officers on how to counsel the suspected cases. Singh in his message said, “Having fought through cancer myself, I firmly believe that this disease can be cured if it is detected early and given the correct treatment. Women are the backbone of our society and we are committed to making every effort for their health and well-being.” The initiative has been funded by the Indian Institute of Banking and Finance and with SBI Foundations the project partner and UE Life Sciences as the technology partner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/free-breast-screening-for-1-lakh-women-at-35-health-centres/articleshow/87290397.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The implementation would begin from November 6. All the organisations concerned will have to set up CCTVs at their gates and parking lots. The flying squads of the police would visit these offices and check the CCTV footage. If the police find that the estate manager of a organisation is not serious about the helmet rule, he would be booked under the Maharashtra Police Act. Even the bikers arguing with the estate managers would attract legal action from the police. The city police have already made helmets compulsory for two-wheeler riders to fill petrol at the petrol pumps. Recently, three petrol pump owners, who had sold petrol to bikers without helmet, were issued show-cause notice asking why the no-objection certificate issued to them by the police should not be cancelled. The strict action by the police comes on the backdrop of road fatalities in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/helmet-must-for-bikers-entry-into-govt-pvt-offices-in-nashik/articleshow/87286818.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Noida||Noida: Different slots for towers? How condos will keep crowd away at Diwali stalls||NOIDA: Several societies have planned Diwali mela and other events for the coming weekend of October 29-31 and residents have said that community programmes are in demand this time after muted celebrations last year. Most complexes will set up food stalls and shopping areas and organise rangoli-making, painting, dancing, and similar events for children. According to Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA) members, some have planned to make their own diyas and candles this time and residents want to shop from society stalls rather than going to crowded markets. “Since Covid-related restrictions have been lifted, people want to get together and celebrate. But we are asking residents not to go to crowded areas, follow social distancing norms and wear masks. In housing societies, we have also asked residents to see if towers can be allotted specific slots for celebrations so that the common areas do not get overcrowded,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners’ Associations (Nofaa). He added that it seems people are organising small parties this time, instead of bigger events at public places. “Rather than allowing big brands and event companies, a lot of home-based entrepreneurs are setting up stalls for bakery and other food items and home decorations,” said Singh. RWA federations are also encouraging people to gather in small groups over a longer period of time. “Many sectors have organised Navratri and Dandiya events but managed to avoid crowding. We are asking RWAs to spread out these events over a longer period of time so that a lot of people do not gather at the same time,” said Yogendra Sharma, president, Federation of Noida RWAs (FONRWA). He added that many sectors have decided to hold their events for more days and not just on one evening. Meanwhile, a survey conducted across 10 Indian cities, including Gurgaon, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Pune, has shown that Noida residents are most keen on shopping online and visiting local stores. It is followed by Hyderabad. According to the “mood of consumer” survey conducted by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, about 72% of Noida households are likely to order online or get provisions delivered from local stores. Around 80% of the people surveyed have said safety and convenience is their top priority while shopping, over other criteria like budget and choice of products (range). “With the risk of Covid, safety has become a top criterion for Noida households when it comes to shopping for festivals this year. Noida seems to be more inclined to order online and from local stores compared to all other cities covered by the survey. The pandemic has changed many habits,” said a spokesperson, LocalCircles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/different-slots-for-towers-how-condos-will-keep-crowd-away-at-diwali-stalls/articleshow/87291264.cms||Snehil Sinha

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday approved the new posting with immediate effect, relieving Vamshi as the AICC in charge of Maharashtra. Vamshi would now be AICC secretary in charge of party’s organisational affairs, a major elevation for a leader from Telangana. His appointment is also being viewed as a step to keep TPCC president A Revanth Reddy in check. Any file pertaining to appointment of general secretaries and other leaders of PCCs would be routed through Vamshi. His elevation comes ahead of a proposed overhaul of TPCC by its new president, Revanth Reddy. Several leaders, who opposed the appointment of Revanth, were now hopeful that the TPCC chief’s decisions on organisational matters without consulting the party seniors, would have to go through Vamshi, who is not from Revanth’s camp.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/vamshi-elevation-a-step-to-check-revanth/articleshow/87289250.cms||---

The event- a memorial lecture series- is being organised in a joint effort by Indira Gandhi National Centre of Art, Varanasi, Allahabad Museum and Acharya Kshetresachandra Bharat Vidya Anusheelan Kendra, Prayagraj. It was in 1996-97 when a group of students of this legendary scholar of Allahabad University organised his 100th birth anniversary. This time, the main speaker at the event will be Rammurti Chaturvedi, a prominent Sanskrit scholar who will deliver his lecture titled ‘Vedon ka param pratipadya'. Throwing light on Pt Kshetresachandra Chattopadhyaya, his son and former head of the department of Chemistry (AU), MC Chattopadhyaya told TOI, “In 1966, my father, who was also the classmate of Subash Chandra Bose, received the President’s award from Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan for his contribution in the field of Sanskrit. The recognition was indeed an appropriate one as Pt Chattopadhyaya dedicated his life to Sanskrit and his contribution truly stands out”. Pt Chattopadhyaya was born in Aamta, Howrah district on October 27, 1896. After initial education in multiple schools, he moved to Presidency College, Calcutta, and became friends with Subhash Chandra Bose. Later, he completed his BA from Muir College, Allahabad, and MA from Queen’s College, Benaras. Both colleges were affiliated to Allahabad University at that time. He then moved to Carmichael College, Rangpoor (now in Bangladesh) post his education, where he taught several subjects including, Sanskrit and Ancient Indian History. In 1924, he moved to Allahabad and joined Allahabad University as a lecturer in Sanskrit. Pt Chattopadhyaya’s long illustrious career was deeply rooted in research-oriented works along with teaching students of BA and MA. He was a firm believer in the power of truth and had a scientific and rational outlook which kept him away from any biases or prejudice. Pt Chattopadhyaya published more than 70 research papers. He was part of several national and international conferences. He had a deep interest in comparative study of religions, history and archaeology. He was well known for his contributions in Vedic and Indo-Iranian studies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/event-to-mark-125th-birth-anniv-of-kshetresachandra-chattopadhyaya/articleshow/87290368.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Shetti writes to RBI to review sale of 58 mills||Kolhapur: Farmers’ leader and former MP Raju Shetti has written to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the newly created Union ministry of cooperation to revaluate the sale of 58 cooperative sugar mills and their assets that were sold to private entities in the state over the past decade. In the letter, Shetti claimed that the mills and their assets were valued at lower than the then prevailing market price to benefit the private entities, which, he alleged, had ties to politicians. “Currently, BJP leaders are targeting opposition leaders selectively in the issue of deals of sugar mills. As many as 58 sugar mills which were built by raising money from the farmers have been sold to leaders of all prominent parties. The mills were earlier controlled by leaders cutting across party lines and therefore I have written to RBI to initiate revaluation of the assets of the mills to unearth the scam,” said Shetti. Shetti has also provided a list of the state cooperation ministers during whose tenure the mills were sold. “For instance, the highest, 32 sugar mills, were sold when Harshvardhan Patil was the minister. Patil was then in Congress and interestingly, he is now in BJP. The cooperation model is an ideal one for both the benefit of farmers as well as the establishments. However, the sector has been maligned due to rampant mismanagement by the directors at the behest of political leaders,” alleged Shetti.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/shetti-writes-to-rbi-to-review-sale-of-58-mills/articleshow/87286835.cms||---

---||Pune||Like MSRTC, private bus operators set to charge passengers more||PUNE: Private bus operators are also likely to announce a hike in fares, a day after the MSRTC increased ticket rates on all routes. Private cabs and taxis, which operate between Mumbai and Pune are also likely to do the same. With the increase in fares, a single ticket on an MSRTC Shivneri bus from Dadar to Swargate now costs Rs 525, as against the earlier Rs450. Around 400 MSRTC buses make an estimated 600 trips between Mumbai and Pune every day, according to MSRTC’s Pune traffic manager Dnyaneshwar Ranavare. “This is a chance we cannot miss. Our fares to Mumbai are between Rs400 to Rs 500 and will go up by Rs100 from November 1. Given the high fuel prices, we have to increase fares just like the MSRTC has done. We hope passengers will not object,” Sunil Salva, director of Neeta Travels, told TOI. Last week, private bus operators had been wary about increasing fares as per the set formula of the state government ahead of the festive season. “Things have changed after the MSRTC’s hike. Now we have a solid reason to give passengers. Apart from hiking fares due to fuel prices, we will look at further increasing fares by 50% of MSRTC bus fares operating on the same routes,” said another transporter, adding that there will others who ply on old rates in a bid to get more passengers. Private cab owners too said a fare hike was in the offing. “Fares on all routes, including Pune-Mumbai, have to be increased by around Rs3 per kilometre. Many have already increased rates,” a cab driver said. “The current cab fare to Mumbai airport from Pune is Rs3,500, in addition to the toll. We are looking to increase the fare by around Rs200. A final decision will be taken by the month-end,” said a representative of the Cool Cab service.  Those operating shared cabs said the fares per person from Pune station to Dadar have been increased to Rs900 from Rs800.“Only people with reserved tickets are allowed on inter-city trains while local trains ply between Pune and Lonavla for the moment. And now, bus and cab fares have increased. It is becoming difficult for ordinary travellers every day,” said Satish Burse, who works in Navi Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/like-msrtc-pvt-bus-operators-set-to-charge-passsengers-more/articleshow/87290382.cms||Joy Sengupta

Here N stands for newspaper, E for eating nutritional food and W for workout. These are the three things that I have started to take seriously in my new normal life. Unlike earlier when I used to only glance through the newspaper, on my way to work, I read it cover to cover now. It keeps me informed about things and that is very important. Next, I have started eating healthily, since I have realised that food plays a very crucial role in battling an ailment like Covid-19. I have incorporated things like nuts and eggs in my daily diet and ensure that I drink a lot of water (warm water mostly). The third important thing that I do now is work out regularly. When we used to go to the office and spend eight hours there (on average), there still used to be some sort of physical exercise. At least we got up from our desk to go chit-chat with colleagues or make a trip to the pantry together. At home, all that is missing. Here we are continuously sitting. That, along with unhealthy food had led to weight gain, which made me feel fatigued. I have changed my ways now and ensure I get a workout in, every day. In all, these things have helped me cope with life in this new normal world.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had planned to auction 322 stalls, but only 111 stalls have so far been auctioned.

This includes a clean environment tax of Rs 3,000 on each stall and Rs 500 fire tax per day for every stall. Earlier, the civic administration had proposed a ban on firecrackers in the city, but the general body of the NMC had turned down the proposal and allowed the auction for the firecrackers stalls.

The gun, which has taken nearly a decade to be finally inducted into the Army, had faced a number of issues during test fire. There were 3 to 4 instances of muzzle brake hit — the shell hits the upper part of the barrel instead of flying off. This was a major bottleneck in the final deployment of the guns by the Army. The Army has taken in the gun, but final deployment remained due to the issues. The muzzle brake hit incidents have taken place when the gun was fired with zone 6 charge, said sources. Now, the major hurdle has been crossed and the gun is ready to be fired at full range, the sources added. However, still the gun will have to go through another round of reliability test fires before it is finally deployed by the Army. This was because one more muzzle brake hit incident had taken place this year, after which an inquiry was constituted and changes were suggested. The latest muzzle brake hit happened when the Army was conducting an exercise by creating situation similar to real action. Even guns made by entities other than the ordnance factories have suffered muzzle brake incidents over a period. The production order of over 100 Dhanush guns with the factory continues and so far over a dozen have been sent to the Army. The final deployment will depend on the reliability trials, planned in November, said sources. It has been a long way for Dhanush, which was planned in 2019. The first batch was handed over to the Army in April 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/waiting-to-be-deployed-desi-bofors-clears-full-charge-test/articleshow/87290395.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||MGIMS’s ‘Aarambh’ initiative set for Maha role||Wardha: A division-level training for master trainers from 11 districts of Nagpur and Amravati division under ‘Aarambh’ initiative was inaugurated at Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), Sewagram. Rubal Agrawal, commissioner of Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), Maharashtra, was chief guest at the inaugural function. ‘Aarambh’ — an initiative by MGIMS is aimed at building the capacity of parents and other caregivers — emphasizes on early childhood development and to provide parenting information to underprivileged communities. This initiative will be implemented throughout Maharashtra by the department of women and child development through ICDS. UNICEF is providing support to MGIMS to sustain a state-level resource team as well as 30 key trainers to facilitate this scale-up. The state resource team and key experts will train 250 master trainers, who in turn will train 3,000 ICDS supervisors who will then guide nearly 1,12,000 anganwadi workers in the state and expand the reach of the programme to each household. “With 250 master trainers, 3,000 supervisors and over 1.1 lakh aganwadi workers, I can foresee a bright future for all children in Maharashtra,” said Agrawal addressing the participants. She also commended the efforts of the entire team and assured support for the successful implementation of this project. “I shall be happy to witness ‘Aarambh’ rolling out throughout the country in the next two years,” she added. Through ‘Aarambh’ and its profound training programmes, we have been successful in reaching out to communities and thereby helping in shaping the early childhood development in the district,” said collector Prerna Deshbhratar. “This initiative not only focuses on health and nutrition, but also on key aspects of development like emotional, intellectual and social well being of children,” she added. “MGIMS always stands as a testament for community empowerment and social service,” said vice-president of Kasturba health society PL Tapadiya. “The ‘Aarambh’ initiative is a beautiful symbiosis of public-private partnership of MGIMS, UNICEF, government of Maharashtra and district administrations,” he added. Master trainers from 11 districts have assembled for a five-day training programme at MGIMS. “The community-led programme was initiated at MGIMS in 2003 as a means to empower family members in the upbringing of their children. What started with just a handful of ASHA workers has today become a pan-Maharashtra model for early childhood development,” said Dr NM Gangane, dean MGIMS. Sharmila Mukherjee (consultant, UNICEF) invited all district-level ICDS officials to ensure quality training programmes so that the initiative can be implemented smoothly across the state. “Through ‘Aarambh’, we aim to bring holistic development of children in their formative years,” said Dr Subodh Gupta, who is also the brain behind the project. Our team of passionate faculty members, project team, ASHA and anganwadi workers along with their supervisors have worked hard for the last two decades. It is a moment of pride to see this scale-up throughout Maharashtra. I hope the idea as powerful as this will definitely get scaled-up beyond Maharashtra,” he said. Prerna Deshbhratar, and Dr Sachin Ombase, CEO, Wardha, were the guests of honour. PL Tapadiya, Dr BS Garg, secretary, Kasturba Health Society, Dr NM Gangane, Dr SP Kalantri, medical superintendent, Kasturba Hospital, Dr Subodh Gupta, and Sharmila Mukherjee, shared the dais with other dignitaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mgimss-aarambh-initiative-set-for-maha-role/articleshow/87289173.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Energy Efficiency Index: Rajasthan front runner at number 2||JAIPUR: Rajasthan has bagged the second position in the State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI)-2020 securing 61 points out of 100. After Karnataka which topped the list with 70 points, Rajasthan is the other state to have been assessed as the ‘front runner’. The index categorized 36 states and UTs under ‘front runner’, ‘achiever’, ‘contender’, and ‘aspirant’ based on their EE-related efforts and achievements. In SEEI 2019, there was no state in the ‘front runner’ category. Karnataka and Rajasthan have undertaken various initiatives to upscale energy efficiency in the state, beyond notifications of relevant regulations, the report by the ministry of power said. Rajasthan is the only state to have constituted an Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) cell in its Public Works Department (PWD) from the state fund. This cell operates under guidance of the chief architect of PWD, said the report.Among the other initiatives that contributed to the state’s high score is that it has taken steps to set up energy saving targets for EE (energy efficiency) in street lighting, water and sewerage, and non-PAT industries. It is one of the few states that reported a measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) mechanism for evaluating demand side management programmes. The report said that Rajasthan has appointed dedicated agencies to conduct periodic energy audits of street lighting, water and sewerage infrastructure, and water treatment systems. The Rajasthan SDA organises the Rajasthan Energy Conservation Awards (RECA) every year for five sectors and 50 sub-sectors. The index developed the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in collaboration with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE) aims to help drive energy efficiency policies with implementation at the state and local level, highlight best practices, encourage healthy competition among states and track progress in managing energy footprint. SEEI 2020 assessed states’ performance in energy efficiency through 68 indicators across six sectors such as buildings, industry, municipalities, transport, agriculture and distribution companies (discoms), and cross sector initiatives. The indicators assess states’ performance in policy and regulation, financing mechanisms, institutional capacity, adoption of energy efficiency measures, and energy savings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/energy-efficiency-index-raj-front-runner-at-no-2/articleshow/87290402.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Poor uptake of vaccine among pregnant women||AURANGABAD: The Covid-19 vaccination drive for pregnant women and lactating mothers has received a poor response in the rural areas of the Aurangabad district. Of 52,202 pregnant women from nine talukas, only 1,274 women have received at least one vaccine doese, making up an abysmal 2.44% coverage in this particular category. According to official data, vaccination among lactating mothers stands at 1.49%, with only 714 of the target population of 47,620 receiving at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. Health authorities said the dedicated vaccination drive is finding few takers despite the official launch taking place almost three months ago. “Vaccine hesitancy is higher among the pregnant women and lactating mothers in the rural areas when compared to the urban pockets of the district. The women should get vaccinated without any fear or hesitation to ensure safety for themselves and their infants,” said a senior official from the zilla parishad (ZP). The official asserted that the vaccine was safe for the pregnant women and their foetus, and that lactating mothers can also continue feeding their babies after receiving the vaccine jabs. “Unlike in the past, the vaccination drive is going on smoothly in rural areas. Considering the possible threat of a third wave, every eligible individual should get vaccinated as soon as possible,” an official said. Among the other identified vulnerable groups for the dedicated vaccination drive, only 2.3% people with disabilities, out of a target population of 9,332, and 7.2% bed-ridden individuals (of 1,864) have received the first dose so far. The district on Monday reported nine fresh cases of Covid-19, including four from the rural areas. The district has 112 active cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/poor-uptake-of-vaccine-among-pregnant-women/articleshow/87286849.cms||---

The state health department has launched a sustained drive to ensure that remote pockets not having full compliance with 100% vaccination get covered by December, to achieve vaccination of over 90% of the population. The statistics reveal that some districts with low first and second dose rates are Amreli and Botad, whereas districts with high first and low second dose coverage are Banaskantha, Dahod, Dang, Gandhinagar, Gir Somnath, Kutch, Patan and Surat. On Tuesday, Gujarat covered 50% of its eligible population with both doses. City-based experts said while about 70% vaccination is a prerequisite for herd immunity, the drop in cases is an encouraging sign. “The need of the hour is to ensure booster doses for all, and to encourage those who are due for the second shot to take it without delay, especially when there is no dearth of vaccine doses in the state,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/rural-areas-a-challenge-for-jab-coverage/articleshow/87289295.cms||---

Under the pretext of sending her a gift of Rs 30 lakh, gold bangles, purse, clothes, etc, he made her transfer Rs 6.69 lakh for paying customs duty and other charges to enable the delivery of gifts to her residence. The woman was made to transfer the money citing that the gifts were stuck at Delhi airport. In April last year, the victim received a friend request on Facebook from ‘Tony Mike’, which she accepted. Mike sent her a message that he was sending her a gift. Thereafter, the accused told her that her gift had reached Delhi airport and she needed to pay customs duty to enable delivery of the gift to her residence. The accused gradually made her transfer a sum of Rs 6.69 lakh to different accounts under the pretext of various changes. She was made to transfer the money till January 2021, after which he switched off his mobile phone and could not be contacted. The victim then registered a FIR at Khandeshwar police station on Monday. The police filed a FIR registered under section 406 (criminal breach trust), 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused Tony Mike.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-new-panvel-woman-duped-of-rs-7-lakh-by-fake-online-friend/articleshow/87291287.cms||George Mendonca

Commuters travelling to Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Borivali, Dhule, Jalgaon, Chopda and Nandurbar etc will have to pay the increased fare for ordinary buses, as well as, semi-luxury and Shivshahi buses. Yogesh Bhilare from Nashik, who frequently travels to Mumbai and Pune said, “With the rise in fuel prices, hike in bus fares was expected. However, the MSRTC should also consider improving their services. At times, the bus stand manager is not even aware when a bus on a particular route is scheduled to arrive.” Bhilare said that with the advancement around us, the MSRTC services should also change eventually. Other commuters said that when e-payment is accepted everywhere, they wonder why the ST is still taking cash payments for tickets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-commuters-demand-clean-buses/articleshow/87286861.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Footfall at govt vaccination centres drops drastically in October||PUNE: Maharashtra’s average daily vaccination during the October 13-25 period dropped to 4.49 lakh — a slide of over 1.5 lakh jabs in comparison to the October 1-12 period, when it was 6.2 lakh shots per day on an average, the state health department data revealed. The government sites administering Covid vaccine doses noticed a drastic drop in daily beneficiaries’ footfall in October. The authorities attributed it not only to the festive season and the 84-day gap between two Covishield doses, but also to a growing complacency among citizens after Covid cases started plummeting in the state. A state public health department official told TOI, “The average daily jabs in October have fallen by about a lakh. One reason is the festive season, while each district may have its own set of causes behind this fall. We are trying to increase the number of daily jabs via the two missions — Kavach Kundal and Yuva Swasth Abhiyaan.” Anjali Tilekar, a medical officer from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s Kothrud ward office, said, “Most beneficiaries have started turning up for second doses, while the number of first dose beneficiaries has reduced. The 84-day gap between two Covishield doses may have caused a drop in daily beneficiary numbers as many may only have their due dates for second doses coming up later. Also, it seems that Covid-fear is receding among people and some just do not want to get their shots in time.” Tilekar said a recent Covid death list at the district-level showed that many who had succumbed had not even taken their first Covid jabs. “It seems that vaccine hesitancy is still an issue. We did not see any Covid surge after Ganesh festival or Navratra because scores of citizens have now been vaccinated. People must understand that vaccination is one of the most effective approaches to combat Covid and shying away from getting the vaccine could prove costly, especially with fears of a third wave,” she said. A senior ward medical officer in Pune told TOI, “After the long queues in government vaccination centres earlier this year, when free jabs were being offered to citizens, the daily footfall of beneficiaries has dropped by half in October.” Slots in government sites have also opened on CoWIN, with many showing green now. A source said this declining trend of beneficiaries was being witnessed from September-end. The district authorities were now dispatching lower number of doses to the Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) not having adequate cold storage facilities, he added. An official at a government hospital said the daily footfall at the site had dropped to 60-70 on an average as against nearly 200 earlier. “Earlier, even the 100 doses that each CVC was getting per day would be exhausted within a day because of high demand. But the number of beneficiaries has fallen significantly in October,” the official said. A vaccination in charge at a PCMC hospital said the beneficiaries’ footfall at the facility dropped by about 40% in the last fortnight but the officilas were trying to maximise the coverage by conducting drives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/footfall-at-govt-vax-centres-drops-drastically-in-october/articleshow/87290404.cms||Neha Madaan

Gujarat accounts for almost 75% of dyes and dye intermediates exported from India. In value terms, India’s dye exports rose to $1,449 million (approximately Rs 10,870 crore at the rate of Rs 75.02 per US dollar) in the first six months of the current financial year, shows data from the Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). Dye exports had stood at $986 million (Rs 7,397 crore) in April-September 2020. Exports of dyes intermediates firmed up to $83 million (Rs 623 crore) from $72 million (about Rs 540 crore), Chemexcil data shows. “The increase in dyes and dye intermediate exports is mainly due to the low base of the last year, when production had fallen as several factories closed due to the lockdown and Covid-19 induced disruptions,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat region, Chemexcil. Exports of inorganic, organic chemicals and agrochemicals from the country also increased by 44% for April-September 2021, according to Chemexcil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/exports-of-dyes-up-47-in-april-sept/articleshow/87289315.cms||---

The school also lodged a complaint against the teacher but the personnel at the Sukher police station here had not registered it officially till late on Tuesday evening. Two others lodged another complaint against the teacher with the Ambamata police station under Section 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) of IPC. After Nafisa Attaria expressed happiness on social media on Pakistan’s victory, the incident came to light when one of the parents in a WhatsApp group noticed the post.  When the parent questioned her if she supported Pakistan, in her answer she allegedly said, “Yes, I support Pakistan.” The parents objected to this and brought the matter to the notice of the school management and media. Nafisa later apologised through a video and said that she had no intention of hurting anyone’s sentiments. She clarified that while watching the match her family had divided itself into two groups and she was supporting the Pakistan team. “When Pakistan won, I updated my status and wrote we won. Later, when I started getting comments on the post, I realised the mistake and removed the post. I am an Indian and I am sorry if I have hurt the sentiments of the people,” she said in the video. Furious over the matter, ABVP members barged into the school premises on Tuesday and demanded action against the teacher. They demanded that the school management should file a case against her at the police station. Director of the school Mahendra Sojatia said a complaint against the teacher was lodged in Sukher police station as “any action against the nation and the sentiments of countrymen was not tolerable.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/udaipur/teacher-applauds-pak-win-on-social-media-gets-the-boot-from-school/articleshow/87290426.cms||---

They will add 1,200 MBBS seats, representing about 21% of the total number of prevailing seats in Gujarat, said sources in the state’s health department. Presently, there are about 30 colleges in the state with 5,508 seats for which the Admission Committee for Professional Under Graduate Medical Educational Courses (ACPUGMEC) carries out the admission process. There are another 300 seats in the state under two deemed universities for which the admission is carried out at the college level. ACPUGMEC is not involved in this. “The new medical colleges in Morbi, Godhra and Porbandar are expected to start in 2021-22. The inspection process by National Medical Commission (NMC) has been completed. The new medical colleges will add about 150 seats each,” said an official in the health department. The state health department aims to start new medical colleges in Rajpipla, Navsari, Jam Khambhaliya, Botad and Veraval in the next academic year, he added. State health minister Rushikesh Patel did not respond to calls and messages on his phone. Gujarat government is working on a plan to ensure that there is one medical college in every district of the state. For this, the department will have to set up about seven additional medical colleges in districts that do not have a single college, said sources. The proposal is in line with the Centre’s vision to have one college in every district of the country in the next 5 years. The Centre has given nod to 157 new medical colleges in India since 2014 and has invested Rs 17,691.08 crore on these projects, the Union health ministry said recently. On completion, nearly 16,000 under graduate medical seats would be added, it said. Of these, 6,500 seats have already been created with the functioning of 64 new medical colleges, said the government. NMC, under the ministry of health and family welfare, is working on a plan to increase the total number of under graduate medical seats from about 82,500 to 1 lakh seats by next year , said sources. There are close to 550 medical colleges in the country offering MBBS courses of which 49% are government run and remaining are self-financed and on public-private-partnership basis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-to-get-8-medical-colleges-in-two-years/articleshow/87289344.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Allahabad||Now, AU students to have ‘smart’ access to central varsity’s library||Prayagraj: Students, pursuing various undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Allahabad University (AU), can now have access to various online resources available with the Central Library of AU through their smartphones, laptop or computers. Considered to be a major fillip to library services being extended to its students, the remote access of the e-content for the student could be accessed through the varsity website. Presently, the teaching faculty members of AU and the research scholars can avail the remote access to all the online resources of the library through the service provider, Remote XS. After getting their user ids and passwords, the online resources including journals, e-books and online databases can be accessed by the users/students. However, after accessing the usefulness of the remote access for the larger student fraternity, AU vice-chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava decided to open the access for UG and PG students of the campus. The facility would benefit around 20,000 students of AU. “The access to the e-resources of the library would be provided to the UG and PG students through the portal called ‘Infed’ which provided to AU by Inflibnet (Information and Library Network) of the University Grants Commission (UGC). For this, Infed has provided us with a software called ‘shibboleth’ which would provide all the e-resources available to the central library to the students, free of cost”, said the librarian of the Central Library of AU, Dr BK Singh. He further informed that for availing of the facility, the student has to visit the varsity website and under the section of 'download forms', the form pertaining to using this facility can be downloaded. “After filling the form, the PG students have to get it forwarded by the head of the department concerned and the UG students will have to get the same done by the dean student welfare. The duly filled form would have to be submitted at the library and the student, in turn, would get a link on his or her mail, clicking on which would enable them to generate their id and password”, explains Singh. Once generated, the same would be used to get access to all the e-resources through the library section on AU’s website, he added. After entering the library section, the student would have to click at Infed and enter his or her username and password to get access to all the e-resources. The student just needs to have an internet connection for using the facility. The useful facility would be available to AU students alone as the same has not been extended to constituent colleges because Inflibnet is provided by UGC only for AU.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/now-au-students-to-have-smart-access-to-central-varsitys-library/articleshow/87290428.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan bans construction of shrines in police stations||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan police has issued a circular prohibiting construction of shrines inside police stations and police offices. The order was issued by ADG (police housing) A Ponnunchamy on Monday citing Rajasthan Religious Buildings and Places Act, 1954, which forbids the use of public places for religious purposes. A top Rajasthan police official told TOI that the order preceded a list of complaints about construction of shrines inside police buildings which reportedly necessitated the enforcement of the order. The circular said there had been an increase in construction of ‘pooja sthal’ with ‘jan sahbhagita’ (public participation) in the name of faith inside police stations which is not legal. The circular also said maps approved for the construction of police stations did not have provisions for places of worship. When asked about the order, Ponnunchamy claimed he merely issued directions to ensure that the rules of the Act were followed. “We had received three complaints about certain shrines being constructed inside police buildings,” the official said. “The complaints said that these shrines were being constructed with the help of public participation. Therefore, we reminded all senior officials to ensure that the specific law must be enforced so that police premises are not used for worship,” the official added. While the Rajasthan police also claimed that the practice of building religious places with public participation in police offices and police stations in the name of faith was not legal, it clarified that the order will have no impact on existing structures in police stations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-bans-construction-of-shrines-in-police-stations/articleshow/87290443.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Autorickshaw fare to step on the gas||AHMEDABAD: Amdavad na rickshawallahs may still be all enthusiastic about ferrying you from one place to another or showing you around the city. But that will come at a greater cost now. If you happen to take an autorickshaw as your convenient mode of point-to-point transport then your per kilometre cost of travel may increase by 50%. In the wake of rising costs of CNG, autorickshaw drivers have proposed to increase fares. CNG prices have risen by almost 15% over the past six months — from April to October. Adani CNG price increased from Rs 54.62 per kg to Rs 62.99 per kg. Gujarat Gas has increased CNG prices from Rs 52.45 per kg to Rs 60.78 per kg. A meeting between autorickshaw drivers’ union members and the representatives of the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Ahmedabad, is set to be held on Wednesday. A decision is expected to be taken on the fares. Rajveer Upadhyay, the president of Jagrut Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union (JADU), said: “Currently, the minimum charge to travel 1.25km is Rs 15.” He added: “We have proposed to increase this to Rs 20. That apart, the per kilometre charge over and above the minimum fare should also be raised from the existing Rs 10 per kilometre to Rs 15-16 per kilometre.” He went on to say: “We will put forth this proposal before the RTO officials.” Even if the per kilometre rate is increased to Rs 15 from the existing Rs 10, it will mean a 50% surge. This implies autorickshaw fares will be revised by at least 40% in the days to come. After the lockdown, autorickshaw drivers faced a steep decline in business amid Covid-19 restrictions, the emergence of the work-from-home culture, and the citizens’ reluctance to use public transport. “The business has picked up well of late and we are getting more trips in a day. But our revenues continue to remain eroded because of the surge in fuel costs,” said an Ahmedabad-based autorickshaw driver. “We don’t get enough money. We hope the RTO allows us to revise the rates.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/autorickshaw-fare-to-step-on-the-gas/articleshow/87289350.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Bareilly||Kheri violence: SIT arrests 2 farmers for 'killing' BJP workers||BAREILLY: The special investigation team (SIT) has for the first time arrested two farmers in connection with an FIR filed by a BJP worker after their vehicle mowed down several people, triggering the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence that followed. The two farmers, Vichitra Singh and Gurwinder, were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly "lynching" three BJP workers. Confirming their arrest, SIT chief Upendra Agarwal told TOI, "We gathered evidence related to their involvement in the case and arrested them after proper investigation." An FIR with the charge of murder was registered against unidentified farmers based on a complaint by BJP worker Sumit Jaiswal, who himself is a co-accused for allegedly mowing down four farmers and a journalist. Jaiswal didn’t mention in the FIR lodged by him the fact that the farmers were mowed down by their convoy and that they were attacked in retaliation. Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra is the main accused in the case of farmers' killing. The first FIR in the Kheri violence was registered by farmers against Ashish and others. SIT has arrested 13 people, including Ashish, so far in that case. Special prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “Gurwinder and Vichitra Singh were produced before the magistrate, who has sent them to 14-day judicial custody in connection with the second FIR. We have sought police custody remand (PCR) of Gurwinder as SIT wants to further question him and to recover the weapon (stick, etc) which he was seen carrying in a video. We have also applied for a second PCR of Sumit Jaiswal, Nandan Singh Bisht, Satya Prakash Tripathi and Shishupal, who are the co-accused in the farmers’ killing case. The investigation officer can seek multiple PCR within 15 days of arrest of the accused." Gurwinder, 26, is a resident of Gola area of Lakhimpur Kheri district. He is suspected to be the one seen wearing a white t-shirt with the picture of a controversial Sikh leader. According to sources, he had told SIT that he had returned from Punjab where such t-shirts are worn by several people. He had purchased one such t-shirt from there and wore it on the day of the farmers’ protest in Tikunia. Vichitra Singh, 29, is suspected to be the person shouting in a video purportedly urging others to push the ‘Thar’ jeep and set it on fire. Jasbir Singh, a prominent Sikh leader and national president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangthan, told TOI, “We are aware that two farmers have been arrested by SIT. I will speak with the SIT members and enquire about their guilt. The lynching of the BJP workers was an act of retaliation by the angry mob after several farmers were mowed down at the protest site. It cannot be termed as murder. We will also seek legal advice from our counsel to pursue their case.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/kheri-violence-sit-arrests-2-farmers-for-killing-bjp-workers/articleshow/87288047.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

And half of the patients with acute bronchitis have confirmed of testing positive for Covid-19 in the past. Lungs in Covid recovered patients continue to be sensitive to allergens and pollutants as they (lungs) had undergone some scarring during the Covid illness,” said physician Aniket Joshi, secretary of the Association of Physicians of India (API), Pune branch. Ruby Hall Clinic’s physician Abhijit Lodha said, “Once the lungs are damaged in Covid, they become very susceptible to change in weather and atmospheric humidity being experienced these days.” Besides seasonal variation, vehicular pollution is also adding to these cases, Lodha said, adding that quite a few patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis admitted to undertaking dusting and cleanliness at home/shops/offices ahead of the festive season. Acute bronchitis starts with upper respiratory tract infection. The most at risk are individuals in the 25-50 years age bracket. “These patients test negative for Covid. Hence, most of them are not treated with antiviral but with antibiotics, inhaled steroid, nebulization and bronchodilator drugs. Some patients are given antivirals like oseltamivir if we suspect influenza-like illness,” Joshi said. Oral steroids are also used to treat a section of patients with acute bronchitis. “We use oral steroids only when the inhaled steroid is found not to be working,” Joshi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cases-of-lingering-cough-surge-covid-recovered-worst-affected/articleshow/87290427.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Ahmedabad||Industrial incentives: Project completion time extended in Gujarat||GANDHINAGAR: Agreeing to long-pending demands of industries, which have been asking for extension of deadlines for availing benefits of the 2016 industrial policy on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government, has in principle, agreed to extend the deadline by six months. Industries which have been availing benefits of the 2016 industrial policy, will continue to get these benefits until July 2022. According to the available data, industrial projects of over Rs 12,000 crore registered under the 2016 scheme are near completion. Many industries which have started development of industrial units, but could not get registration under the scheme have also requested for the registration under the old policy, so that they can begin production by July 2022. This decision is still pending as allowing fresh registration under the old policy will adversely affect registration under the new industrial policy. A key source close to the development said, “A number of industries which have invested over Rs 500 crore or even Rs 1,000 crore in some cases, are experiencing difficulty in commencing commercial production due to unexpected break in their plans due second wave of Covid-19. As the decision does not have any financial implication on the government, so the government has agreed to give six months’ extension post January 2022.” “Compared to the 2020 industrial policy, most of the industries find the 2016 policy more lucrative and have requested to be registered under the old policy. The government will have to take the final call whether it will allow new registrations under the lapsed 2016 policy or not. As 2022 will be assembly election year, it is likely that the government may opt for accepting all the demands of industries,”added the sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/project-completion-time-extended/articleshow/87289362.cms||---

Paatil had rapped mayor Keyur Rokadiya for not doing enough to tackle the stray cattle menace in the city in a public function on Monday. The woman Madhu Solanki, a resident of Navayard area, suffered a fracture in her hip due to the incident that took place around the same time when VMC functionaries had gone into a huddle to discuss cattle menace after Paatil’s remarks earlier in the day.  VMC meanwhile maintained that it has been doing better than other cities when it comes to taking action against cattle left astray. Rokadiya reiterated that the civic body had caught 690 bovines and registered 28 police complaints against their owners. He said that this number his highest in the state.  Rokadiya said that soon therr will be nine teams to impound cattle in the city. He said that the impounded cattle were being sent to various ‘panjrapoles.’ These cattle shelters that were earlier given Rs 1,500 per bovine to their upkeep were now being paid Rs 3,000 per animal. He said that Paatil’s remarks were being taken as positive criticism. Paatil’s jibes have, however, sparked a major political row within the BJP. Many believe that someone from the party itself may be misinforming Paatil and not presenting the real picture. Others believe that it was a fact that cattle was still on the road and Paatil was right in pointing this out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/woman-knocked-down-by-cow-in-vadodara/articleshow/87288318.cms||---

This, after it was aired on TOI’s citizen reporter app. “The sewage water was overflowing on the roads, emanating a foul smell in the entire area.

According to Jaipur (Rural) SP Shankar Dutt Sharma, the accused used a gas cutter to cut open the ATM.“The ATM caught fire and the accused fled with about Rs 38 lakh while currency notes of nearly Rs 3 lakh were gutted,” he said. Police said the exact amount of cash burnt and robbed could not be ascertained as they are waiting for the bank and the ATM operating contractor to present the final loss assessment report. “It was a completely unguarded ATM. Moreover, CCTV was defunct and the alarm did not set off even when the accused tried to cut it open,” Sharma told TOI, adding that a special investigation team (SIT) was set up to track the accused. Rajasthan police suspect that the same gang that had staged ATM thefts across Jhunjhunu district in the past two weeks was behind the incident. “Our teams are examining the modus operandi to cross-check it with other robberies that took place in Jhunjhunu district. The ATM gang use a gas cutter which is not the most favoured instrument that seasoned criminals rely upon.

Disposing of a writ petition filed by radio inspector Kuldip Singh, Justice Saral Srivastava observed, “As according to the petitioner, the charge with respect to post of some objectionable post on the WhatsApp group in the enquiry is not found proved against him, this court is of the opinion that the petitioner may be permitted to submit a detailed representation against the transfer order before the deputy inspector general of police (Operation) (Police Telecommunication), U.P. Police Radio Headquarters, Lucknow within a period of two weeks with a copy of this order.” The court further directed that in case representation is filed by the petitioner, as directed above, the DIG shall consider and decide the same strictly in accordance with law, by a reasoned and speaking order, preferably within a period of two months thereafter. “For a period of three months or till disposal of representation of petitioner, whichever is earlier, transfer order dated September 8, 2021, and relieving order dated September 13, 2021shall remain stayed,” the court directed. The petitioner was transferred on September 8, 2021, from Agra to Kanpur on the ground that he had forwarded some objectionable post on a WhatsApp group and, accordingly, an enquiry was instituted against the petitioner. In the aforesaid backdrop, the petitioner was transferred on administrative exigency after seeking approval from the Police Radio Establishment Board. The counsel for the petitioner challenged the transfer order on the ground that it is punitive in nature. He further submitted that the petitioner is going to retire in January 2023 and as per rule, the effort should be made to post an employee in his home district, if the employee is going to retire within two years from the date of transfer. Hence, on these grounds, he submitted that the transfer order is not sustainable. However, the state counsel contended that the transfer order has been passed in administrative exigency of service. Passing the directive, the court in its decision dated October 5, 2021 disposed of the petition, observing, “Be that as it may, the counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of the court towards the enquiry report dated May 31, 2021, conducted by additional state radio officer, Agra Zone, Agra in which the charge against the petitioner is not found proved. Further fact is that the petitioner is due to retire in the month of January 2023 and only 16 months of service of the petitioner are left.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/remarks-against-cm-hc-stays-transfer-of-radio-operator/articleshow/87290509.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Kheri violence: SIT arrests 2 farmers for 'killing' BJP workers||Bareilly: The special investigation team (SIT) has for the first time arrested two farmers in connection with an FIR filed by a BJP worker after their vehicle mowed down several people, triggering the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence that followed. The two farmers, Vichitra Singh and Gurwinder, were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly "lynching" three BJP workers. Confirming their arrest, SIT chief Upendra Agarwal told TOI, "We gathered evidence related to their involvement in the case and arrested them after proper investigation." An FIR with the charge of murder was registered against unidentified farmers based on a complaint by BJP worker Sumit Jaiswal, who himself is a co-accused for allegedly mowing down four farmers and a journalist. Jaiswal didn’t mention in the FIR lodged by him the fact that the farmers were mowed down by their convoy and that they were attacked in retaliation. Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra is the main accused in the case of farmers' killing. The first FIR in the Kheri violence was registered by farmers against Ashish and others. SIT has arrested 13 people, including Ashish, so far in that case. Special prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “Gurwinder and Vichitra Singh were produced before the magistrate, who has sent them to 14-day judicial custody in connection with the second FIR. We have sought police custody remand (PCR) of Gurwinder as SIT wants to further question him and to recover the weapon (stick, etc) which he was seen carrying in a video. We have also applied for a second PCR of Sumit Jaiswal, Nandan Singh Bisht, Satya Prakash Tripathi and Shishupal, who are the co-accused in the farmers’ killing case. The investigation officer can seek multiple PCR within 15 days of arrest of the accused." Gurwinder, 26, is a resident of Gola area of Lakhimpur Kheri district. He is suspected to be the one seen wearing a white t-shirt with the picture of a controversial Sikh leader. According to sources, he had told SIT that he had returned from Punjab where such t-shirts are worn by several people. He had purchased one such t-shirt from there and wore it on the day of the farmers’ protest in Tikunia. Vichitra Singh, 29, is suspected to be the person shouting in a video purportedly urging others to push the ‘Thar’ jeep and set it on fire. Jasbir Singh, a prominent Sikh leader and national president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangthan, told TOI, “We are aware that two farmers have been arrested by SIT. I will speak with the SIT members and enquire about their guilt. The lynching of the BJP workers was an act of retaliation by the angry mob after several farmers were mowed down at the protest site. It cannot be termed as murder. We will also seek legal advice from our counsel to pursue their case.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/kheri-violence-sit-arrests-2-farmers-for-killing-bjp-workers/articleshow/87288170.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Retired IIM-Ahmedabad professor teaches hospital and insurer a lesson for Rs 9,603 deduction||AHMEDABAD: When a hospital fails to disclose all pertinent information regarding treatment and the insurance firm refuses to pay the medical bill in full, most of us would think that is the norm. Faced with a similar situation, a retired faculty member of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, however, dragged the hospital and the insurance company to consumer court and got them to pay up for their deficient service after the insurer deducted Rs 9,603 from a bill of Rs 35,388. The hospital has been asked to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation and another Rs 5,000 towards legal expenses incurred by K V Ramani, who served as a professor with IIM-A for decades. An expert in hospital management, he had founded the Centre for Management of Health Services at the institute in 2003. In March 2012, Ramani’s son Akshay suffered from breathlessness and was rushed to Sterling Hospital. After a couple of hours in the emergency unit, Akshay’s condition stabilized and he was discharged the next day. The hospital charged Rs 35,388 for the treatment and the insurer, Oriental Insurance, cleared the bill after deducting Rs 9,603. This did not go down well with the professor. Ramani filed a complaint with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad (Rural) for deficiency in service on part of the insurer and the hospital. While the forum ordered the insurance firm to make full payment, there was no order against the hospital. In 2014, Ramani filed an appeal in the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, questioning the charges levied for treatment. He claimed that the patient had become normal after 2-3 hours in the emergency room without any serious intervention, and was then admitted as a normal patient. “To claim higher bills from insurance company, the hospital management found a method as per their arrangement inter se to which the patient or consumer is not a party,” he claimed. Besides, Ramani also claimed that the hospital did not disclose what treatment was given to his son. The discharge summary also revealed only the follow-up plan. He cited the norms prescribed by the Medical Council of India making it mandatory for hospitals to supply treatment papers and discharge summary within 72 hours. Similar guidelines have been issued by the National Accreditation Board for Hospital and Health Care, and the Charter of Patient’s Rights by the National Human Rights Commission. Ramani complained that the hospital did not provide case papers and the discharge summary did not reveal information about the procedure performed, medication administered and treatment provided. The state commission accepted Ramani’s arguments and concluded that there was deficiency in service on part of the hospital management and awarded Rs 25,000 compensation. The hospital has also been asked to pay Rs 5,000 extra to Ramani towards legal expenditure.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: ED gets 2 days to present case against Sri Krishna Jewellers||HYDERABAD: Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the high court on Tuesday sought to know from Enforcement Directorate (ED) its case against Sri Krishna Jewellers and Sri Krishna Exim LLP firms within two days.  The judge was hearing a petition filed by Sri Krishna Jewellers and its associate firms challenging the action of ED in freezing their 18 bank accounts. ED had frozen the accounts and initiated action against the firms, charging them with allegedly laundering Rs 700 crore proceeds of crime made through misusing the gold import scheme. ED, in its case, said the firms had smuggled 1800 kg of gold into the country in the name of a gold import scheme. The probe agency said that though the terms of the scheme make it mandatory for the firms to make ornaments from the imported gold and export them, they diverted the gold into the domestic market and made money illegally. According to Vimal Varma Vasireddy, counsel for the jewellers, ED’s action was unwarranted because it based its action on the search and seizure of a Rs 50 crore fixed deposit made by DRI in May 2019. “We are responding to DRI show-cause notices and it will be unfair on the part of ED to subject us to attachments and freezing of accounts,” he said. The firms’ counsel urged the court to de-freeze the accounts to enable them to pay wages to their staff and taxes to state. The case will come up for hearing on October 28. Meanwhile, ED counsel B Narasimha Sarma was asked to ascertain the case of the central agency against the jewellery group.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-gets-2-days-to-present-case-against-jeweller/articleshow/87289453.cms||---

In his complaint, Shahbaz Khan, a resident of Mohabbat Nagar, Rampur, stated that a case of fraud was registered against him in 2020 and that was being investigated by SI Room Singh Baghel, then posted at Swar police station in Rampur. “The SI had demanded Rs 10 lakh to settle the case, which I initially refused to pay. But, then the SI picked up my younger brother and lodged him in jail levelling fake charges. When my family sought his bail, the SI pressured them and struck a deal to free my brother for Rs 6 lakh, ” he alleged. Khan further alleged that following his complaint to police, “the SI would often assault me, misbehave with my family members and torture them due to which my father fell ill and was admitted to a hospital”. The complainant said that after he told the SI that he would initiate legal action against him, Baghel returned some amount and had been pressing him not to lodge a complaint. Meanwhile, Baghel was transferred to Sambhal. CO Dharam Singh Marchal said, “Based on the complaint, a case has been registered against the accused policeman under relevant IPC sections. A probe has also been ordered.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/si-booked-for-accepting-bribe-of-rs-6l-from-a-fraud-accused/articleshow/87288206.cms||Maria Khan

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Health card must for govt hospital admission||KOLKATA: A Swasthya Saathi card or any other government health insurance card has been made mandatory for admission to government hospitals in Bengal. According to an advisory issued by the state health department, the decision has been taken “considering the wide coverage of Swasthya Saathi.”  Those covered under schemes like URN, CGHS and WBHS will also be eligible for admission in government hospitals, said the advisory. The state health department has asked private hospitals not to charge Swasthya Saathi patients more than the prescribed rates for various treatment packages under the scheme. It has also asked private hospitals to prescribe generic medicines to patients admitted under the scheme that offers an insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh. Investigation charges, too, should stick to the government-prescribed rates for Swasthya Saathi patients, it has been said. “….It is expected that most of the residents either have Swasthya Saathi cards or CGHS/WBHS/ESIC cards,” stated the advisory issued on Monday. The direction follows allegations from a section of patients that they were charged more than the rates prescribed. Private hospitals maintained that they stick to the prescribed rates for Swasthya Saathi patients. “There is no question of violating the prescribed Swasthya Saathi rates for treatment or investigation. But we can’t always prescribe generic drugs since more than 70% of medicines that patients require are not available in generic forms,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) has decided to appeal against the advisory. “Swasthya Saathi will lose its efficacy if emergency treatment rates are fixed at Rs 5,000. While we accept that other rates should stick to the prescribed package charges, emergency treatment cost can’t be restricted to such a low figure. It is impractical and defies logic,” said AHEI president Rupak Barua.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/health-card-must-for-govt-hosp-admission/articleshow/87289482.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Hyderabad||Chief secretary has no say in RTI, memo unlawful: PIL in Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: Stating that Telangana chief secretary (CS) Somesh Kumar crossed his brief by issuing a written direction to all public information officers performing their duties under the Right to Information (RTI) Act in the state to obtain prior permission from the heads of departments before parting with information, a public interest litigation (PIL) petition was filed in the high court urging it to declare the CS’ action as unlawful and unconstitutional. The PIL filed by RTI activist Ganji Srinivas Rao from Khajaguda of Serilingampalli in Rangareddy district dubbed the memo issued by the CS on October 13 as one that was without jurisdiction and contrary to the provisions of RTI Act brought in to strengthen the process of democracy. The CS’ memo would dilute the spirit of the Act and enable public information officers to delay furnishing of information, he said. “It is a central act passed by Parliament and a CS cannot make rules contrary to the spirit of the Act. Parliament has made the department of personnel and training (DoPT) the nodal agency which functions under the Union ministry of personnel, public grievances, and pensions,” he said in his plea that has made the nodal ministry the first respondent in the case. Stressing on the lack of jurisdiction for a chief secretary in such matters, the petitioner further said that Section 28 of the Act gave power only to the competent authority to make rules by notifications in the official gazette in accordance with the Act. “The speaker can make rules under RTI Act to guide its implementation in the House in case of a legislative assembly of the state and Chief Justice of India in the case of Supreme Court. If it is a high court, its CJ can make rules. The President of India or governor or an administrator appointed under Article 239 of the Constitution can make rules. But a chief secretary figures no where in the RTI scheme of things,” Srinivas said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chief-secy-has-no-say-in-rti-memo-unlawful-pil-in-hc/articleshow/87289485.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Under pressure’ NU to rope in MKCL again despite abysmal track record||Nagpur: In a move that has raised several eyebrows, Nagpur University plans to bring back Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL) for examination work, despite its abysmal track record. Although the plan was strongly opposed by Management Council (MC) members, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari is keen to ink the pact with the Pune headquartered MKCL, which is no longer run by the state government. The MC members claimed the VC was acting under obvious pressure from state ministers, many of whom have stakes in the company. MKCL had a miserable track record while working with the university in the past. It started in 2006 by providing pre and post exam work, but for a decade it failed to deliver desired results. On account of its “worst services”, the company was ousted in 2016 by Chaudhari’s predecessor SP Kane, a NU statutory body member told TOI. Though the VC failed to pick TOI’s calls or respond to text messages, Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable confirmed the development. “I had asked the VC, who replied that MKCL would be gradually handed over the exam work. To begin with, it would handle the winter semester papers,” he told TOI. NU officials said MKCL had failed to provide proper services to many other universities, like neighbouring Gondwana University, leading to its ouster from there. “It is not even going to provide the manpower. It will be offering us only their software, which means we need to employ additional manpower. The main difficulty is these employees need to be technically qualified. Currently, Promarc has roped in 84 employees looking for pre and post exams work. How are we going to find technically sound employees,” they asked. Disappointed with NU’s decision, Promarc staffers told TOI that though their contract was till summer 2022 exams, NU had already told them that they would no longer be needed. “We have doled NU out from a plethora of troubles it faced due to advent of online exams. Last year, we conducted the summer 2020 online papers without charging even a penny. Moreover, we are operating the ‘students facilitation centre’ on our own as a courtesy. It was in fact opened by NU, but none of their employees were technically sound to operate the system needed to run the centre. So we provided our manpower, which would now be removed.” Warning that NU would once again move to the era of inordinately delayed results seen before 2016, MC members said the VC had repeatedly brought the subject up in their meetings even though it was rejected earlier with a voice vote. “We as members had also opposed Integrated University Management System (IUMS) introduced by then education minister Vinod Tawde, despite pressure. We wonder why he cannot convey our decision to the government, as the university is an autonomous body and MC’s decision is final,” they said, alleging that the VC is resorting to dictatorship. MKCL’S JOURNEY IN NU * NU & MKCL inked pact in 2005-2006 to provide wide array of services * Company promised everything online, from students’ enrolment to results * It took four years for MKCL to actually start services in 2009-10 * It managed to upload data of only 1.28 lakh NU students out of 4 lakh * In 2011-12, MKCL handed over bill of Rs1.64 crore to NU towards services * After media reports about e-scam, NU statutory members demanded snapping ties * MKCL sent over 100 reminders for payment of dues, which swelled to Rs3.60 crore * It stopped services in July 2014 by not providing students data like login-ID, hall tickets * NU floated e-tenders to look after its web portal & online services on Jan 16, 2015 * NU renewed ties with MKCL, started web portal and online enrolment of students * Govt issued GR saying MKCL is no longer a state-owned company * NU issued notice to MKCL to explain its stand on various failures & delayed results * In February 2016, NU ousted MKCL, has continued with Promarc till date * Now, VC Chaudhari plans to again rope in MKCL despite stiff opposition||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/under-pressure-nu-to-rope-in-mkcl-again-despite-abysmal-track-record/articleshow/87289486.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The commission also called for two pistol pouches seized from the encounter site to understand how the weapon might have been snatched. Narasimha Reddy was circle inspector (CI) of Amangal at that time and he was a member of the police party that accompanied the four to Chattanpally to recover Disha’s articles. The investigating officer of the rape and murder case, V Surender, and other witnesses, who deposed before the commission, had stated that while the articles of Disha were being recovered, accused Arif threw soil into the eyes of cops and snatched CI Narasimha Reddy’s firearm. Reddy said a 9 mm pistol was issued to him on October 3, 2018, and he had purchased the nylon pouch. He stated that his belt passes through the loop of the pouch and it is closed through Velcro mechanism. He also stated that when the accused were taken to Chattanpally, his pistol was in magazine load (no rounds in chamber) and the safety catch is generally applied after the chamber load (after cocking). The CI said that he cannot say whether an amateur could fire a 9 mm pistol or if the pistol would fall off the hand if fired by a person not used to firing. The commission then asked the circle inspector to come for deposition on Wednesday with a loaded service weapon to see how it is carried and how it is removed from the pouch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/come-with-loaded-pistol-panel-to-ci/articleshow/87289502.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Pune||Pune police reach Lucknow in search of Gosavi in cheating case||PUNE: A city police team on Monday night reached Lucknow in search of Kiran Gosavi, wanted in a Rs3.09 lakh cheating case registered in 2018 by the Faraskhana police, but he had left the Uttar Pradesh capital by then. He was suspected to be hiding somewhere in Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh, the police said on Tuesday. Gosavi remained elusive for more than three years and surfaced recently as the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)’s “independent witness” in the cruise drug case involving Aryan Khan. He hit the headlines by posting a selfie with Aryan, allegedly at the NCB’s office, after the later and others were brought there following the cruise raid. Gosavi went into hiding after state minister Nawab Malik said in a news conference that the former was wanted in a criminal case in Pune. The city police have since renewed their effort to nab Gosavi and even issued a lookout notice for him on October 13. On Monday, Gosavi resurfaced on a social media platform, claiming that he had to go into hiding because he was getting death threats. The Pune police swung into action and concluded after examining the video clip that he was in hiding in Uttar Pradesh. “Our team is following his movements in Uttar Pradesh,” said Amitabh Gupta, the commissioner of police (CP), Pune. Chinmay Deshmukh, a young job seeker from Kasba Peth, had registered the case on May 29, 2018, stating that Thane resident Gosavi was then running a firm -- KPG Dreamz Solutions -- at Ghatkopar in Mumbai. Deshmukh stated that he had come across an online advertisement on a social networking site stating that the company provided jobs to young talented persons in the hotel industry in Malaysia. He then contacted the company. The company officials told him to send his biodata and later took his passport and other details. They asked him to deposit fees of Rs3.09 lakh, including the air ticket charges. Deshmukh deposited the money and the company asked him to come to Mumbai airport for flying out to Malaysia, but no one turned up at the airport. He tried to call the company officials, but no one responded. Deshmukh then realised that he was cheated. After futile searches in Thane and Mumbai, the Faraskhana police in August 2018 filed a chargesheet against Gosavi in the court under Section 299 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which refers to the record of evidence in absence of the accused. On October 18, police had arrested Gosavi’s aide Shaerbano Mohammed Irfan Qureshi (27) of Govandi in Mumbai in the cheating case. It is the police’s case that Qureshi had uploaded material on various social networking sites related to Gosavi’s venture in 2018 of providing jobs to youngsters in hotel industry in Malaysia. She also accepted money in her account, the police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-cops-reach-lucknow-in-search-of-gosavi-in-cheating-case/articleshow/87302609.cms||---

Those who are keen on returning to Nagpur, especially from Pune, to celebrate Diwali with family have to shell out anything between Rs1,800 to Rs3,000 for one-way travel, while the regular fare for sleeper class travel is less than Rs1,500. Private bus operators justified the move and claimed that they suffered huge losses during the Covid-induced lockdown. “The hike in diesel prices has added salt to our injuries,” they said. Data on bookings revealed that private operators started revising bus fares from October 27. Against normal fares, bus fare from Pune to Nagpur is almost Rs400-500 more. Comparatively, the fares of MSRTC are very low. Even on Diwali eve, the fare from Pune to Nagpur is Rs1,700. Engineering professional S Pathan, who works in Pune, said, “I was looking forward to visiting Nagpur during Diwali vacation. Unfortunately, even after planning well in advance I am unable to find a single confirmed ticket for a bus or train.” Pune airport is also closed, and the option to travel via Mumbai would only prove more hectic and costly, she pointed out. Similarly, the return journey would be uncertain. “Though I had been infected in April this year, I still fear traveling in jam-packed carriers, as can be anticipated from heavy bookings. The state-run transport facilities must ensure strict adherence to Covid protocols during the festive season. It is an irony that while the government wants citizens to follow Covid norms it is doing little to ensure there are no violations,” she said. Most of those planning to travel said operating more trains from Pune during the festival period can help passengers. However, railways have neither introduced any new trains for festive season nor increased coaches. A railway official said there is no scarcity of berths on trains running between Pune and Nagpur. According to the official, as many as seven trains are plying between Pune and Nagpur. "Besides, tatkal quota is also available. So, we have no plans to operate additional trains or attach additional coaches,” the official added. Mahendra Luley, president, Nagpur Private Travels Association, said, “As per the transport commissioner’s orders, we can charge up to Rs2,900 plus GST, and all private bus operators are not exceeding this limit.” He pointed out that those charging beyond Rs3,000 are the ones operating buses between Raipur and Pune. He clarified that due to Covid-19 pandemic, passengers travelling in private buses have reduced significantly. Similarly, bus fares from Hyderabad to Nagpur and Nagpur to Banaras and Prayagraj too have increased from Rs1,000 to Rs2,000, and Rs800 to Rs1,200. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said private bus operators cannot charge more than 50% higher than the fare of MSRTC buses. “Passengers can register complaints on our e-mail (dycommr.enf2@gmail.com) by filing the ticket for the charged amount.” Senior officials from the regional transport office also said the city office has not received any complaint of exorbitant fares being charged by private bus operators. “If we receive any complaint, we will definitely take action,” the officials said.

His refusal to draw the sketch of the site of shooting or even look at the one prepared by the alleged encounter case investigating officer (IO) also drew the ire of the SC-appointed panel inquiring into the killings of four accused on December 6, 2019. The ACP, who is the IO of Disha rape and murder case, on Tuesday told the SC panel that it was clear to him that Disha was raped and murdered due to blood and semen stains on her chunni found at Chattanpally, her undergarment found at Thondupally toll plaza, phone conversation recording submitted by her sister and CCTV footage. When commission member Rekha Baldota asked, “How did you identify that the stains were of semen without sending it to the FSL?”, the ACP claimed, “I could identify the semen stains when I saw them due to my experience.” Referring to his unwillingness to draw a sketch and not wishing to comment on the sketch prepared by encounter case IO J Surender Reddy, the commission asked, “Does it mean that you do not wish to disclose the truth of topography before the commission?” The ACP responded: “It was almost one year 10 months ago. I don’t remember the topography. I had explained the scene to the IO. I don’t know what he had drawn.” To counter the issue of two accused being minors, the ACP produced their Aadhaar copies as well cited their physical features, statements before the panchas, doctors and jail authorities to claim that in his mind there was no doubt about they being majors.

The corporation on Tuesday passed a resolution barring the WCL from removal of the habitation from Lalpeth locality. Fierce discussions were held during the CMC’s general body meeting that was organised offline for the first time in last one-and-a-half year. Corporator Shyam Kankam took up the issue of citizens being hassled by the WCL to vacate their homes in three habitations in Lalpeth as the Coal India Limited subsidiary plans to extend the opencast mine after removal of large overburden dumps. Kankam argued that people are living near Lalpeth mine for over 70 years. Many have built pucca houses and settled here for three generations. However, the WCL has initiated the process of removal of the habitation to start a coal mine near Savarkar Hindi Primary School of the CMC, he said. The corporator brought the anguish of the people facing eviction to the knowledge of the CMC House and demanded immediate intervention. After discussing the subtleties of the issue, the House passed a resolution barring WCL from removal of Lalpeth habitation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cmc-bars-wcl-from-removal-of-lalpeth-habitation/articleshow/87289510.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Kolkata||Civic body to set up referral hospitals for needy patients||Kolkata: To address growing public health issues that need hospitalization for detailed medical investigation, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to set up hospitals to provide medical services to citizens, who can’t afford treatment in private hospitals. Announcing this on Tuesday, KMC board of administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim said the facilities would act as referral healthcare centres. At present, the KMC health department runs 144 urban primary health centres across the city. Though these health centres conduct some pathological investigations, there is no scope for hospitalization in case of a medical emergency. According to Hakim, construction of the hospitals was part of a plan to upgrade the civic body’s primary health service into secondary health service. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body planned to build five 100-bed hospitals across the city in phases. “We shall build five 100-bed hospitals, of which the first one will come up in Kidderpore. The next four will be built in another two-three years,” said a civic official. Taking a cue from the ongoing Covid infection, where many infected people couldn’t get admission in either government or private hospitals on time and that led to the deterioration of their conditions, the KMC health department will keep a section of beds reserved for the economically weaker patients. “Out of the 100 beds we may need to reserve some for giving priority to those who belong to the weaker financial group but may need hospitalization,” said a civic official. These hospitals-cum-investigation centres will offer citizens free-of-cost tests for dengue, malaria and also take care of a patient’s pathological and serological tests, said a KMC health department official. “We shall offer a patient a wide variety of tests that are related to lungs, kidneys, liver and others. We shall also make sure that if a patient needs admission for a detailed investigation, we shall not refuse him/her. Depending on the situation, we may need to refer the patient to a hospital for an advanced treatment,” said Firhad Hakim. The KMC had planned the construction of a malaria hospital at Kalighat. The plan couldn’t be materialized finally. However, the civic brasssaid that he wants to take up the project of constructing the hospitals backed by comprehensive planning, said a KMC health department’s senior official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/civic-body-to-set-up-referral-hospitals-for-needy-patients/articleshow/87289515.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Hyderabad||TOI readers tell us how they are celebrating the festival season differently this year...||New clothes for orphans The festival of lights is synonymous with sweets, crackers, and new clothes. But another thing that is important for me is how much I can give and share this joy with the less privileged. The have-nots have been experiencing devastating anxiety, apprehensions and uncertainty in the current situation and it is our responsibility way to show them compassion and bring a smile to their faces. In this context, I have already extended financial assistance to the Navajeevan blind relief centre, Tirupati to provide new clothes to blind orphan children and senior citizens of the centre on of Diwali this year. I hope this gesture will allow them to enjoy the festival, just like others, and not make them feel isolated on this special day. It makes me extremely happy that I can do this little bit for society. -- Srinivasan Ramaswamy Share joy with others This time for Diwali, I want to invite people close to my family and have fun together. I am 70+ and my wife is 66 and our children live abroad. Meeting people of our age at one place and sharing our feelings, I think, will be truly a different experience. It will give us some solace. I also want to use the opportunity to exhibit the art works of my uncle and my father-in-law, for the guests. Third and most important thing I plan to do for Diwali is visit Iskcon temple and offer some alms to the poor. It will also be a spiritual experience that can bring us some peace. -- Dr N Ashok Kumar Give dogs protection, love It was during Diwali in 2019 that we spotted a dog tied by a rope and in pain. My brother and I quickly got into action, and with the help of locals, rescued the animal. Like this, many animals are left to suffer during Diwali -- a lot of them get injured due to the crackers and many run away from home because of the loud noise. This Diwali, like me I want others too, to celebrate it in an animal-friendly way. I want to urge everyone to not leave the dogs alone, protect their ears and eyes, keep a first aid kit handy and do not scare street dogs with crackers. It would also be nice if we can give them food and shelter (in our basements) on Diwali. It is important that we teach your children to take care of dogs and not to engage in mischievous activities that can harm them. - Teja Panneeru||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/toi-readers-tell-us-how-they-are-celebrating-the-festival-season-differently-this-year-/articleshow/87289532.cms||---
---||Patna||Lalu Prasad can't do much now, except getting me shot dead: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday took a dig at RJD chief Lalu Prasad for his statement that he had come to Bihar to ensure the “visarjan” (exit) of the JD(U) leader and said that “at the most, the RJD chief may get me shot if he wanted”. “Wo chahen to goli marwa de sakte hain. Isase jyada aur kuchh nahi kar sakte hain,” Nitish said in a lighter vein when reporters asked him to comment on the Lalu’s “visarjan” remark. The RJD chief has returned to Bihar after three years in jail in Jharkhand in connection with the fodder scam cases. Nitish was talking to reporters in Patna on his return from campaign for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Athan assembly bypolls scheduled on October 30. He came down heavily on RJD’s first family, reminding people of the 15-year rule of “pati-patni (Lalu-Rabri), which remained focused on the development of the family”. Addressing public meetings in Tarapur to garner support for the JD(U) candidate, Rajiv Kumar Singh, Nitish said during the ‘pati-patni’ government, traders abandoned the state out of fear while doctors were abducted. “But things changed after the NDA government was formed in 2005, thus heralding a new era of development with social justice in Bihar,” he asserted. Maintaining that social media didn’t talk about the happenings in the past, Nitish said, “Kal kya hua bhuliyega nahi (Don't forget what happened in the past).” In the same vein, he said people had given an opportunity to the ‘pati-patni’ to serve for 15 years. Instead, they used it for their family’s development. Highlighting the NDA government achievements, Nitish said it worked for every section of the society. Be it minority community, OBC, SC or ST, every section was taken into consideration while drafting welfare schemes for their all-round development. He reminded people belonging to the minority community of the infamous Bhagalpur riots. “The NDA government has done a lot for the uplift of the minority community people. What the ‘pati-patni’ government provided them is no more a secret,” he said. The CM said he cannot claim to have fulfilled all he had promised earlier. “But majority of the promises have been fulfilled and remaining works were underway,” Nitish said and reiterated the government’s commitment to creating job opportunities for youths. While addressing another public meeting in Kusheshwar Asthan, Nitish said the government was serious about finding out solution to the problem related to floods in the area. “Things will change in the coming days. The farmers will be able to do farming on their agricultural land, which is not possible these days due to recurring floods,” he said. State animal and fisheries resources minister and VIP chief Mukesh Sahani also urged the voters to ensure the victory of Aman Bhushan Hazari for all-round development of the region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/if-lalu-wishes-he-may-get-me-shot-but-nothing-more-than-that-nitish/articleshow/87288279.cms||Ramashankar

Besides, the railways have also short-terminated six trains between Kacheguda-Narkhed-Kacheguda, Amravati-Tirupati-Amravati, Amravati-Surat-Amravati. According to officials, the trains have been cancelled owing to blocks for infrastructure work at Badnera on the Bhusaval division. Central Railway will undertake blocks for non-interlocking work in connection with merging of up and down goods cabin at Badnera route relay interlocking (RRI) and for providing connectivity to a wagon repair workshop. The RRI is one of the important signalling systems for major yards. Talking to TOI, Central Railway officials admit ahead of Diwali, all the trains that have been cancelled are drawing packed houses between Nagpur-Mumbai-Nagpur and Pune-Nagpur-Pune and also have a waiting list. The decision has been taken by the headquarters level. There will be a speed restriction of 30kmph up to 4km in the up and down direction till the completion of the work. “Considering 1,200 passengers travelling aboard one train, at least 15,000 passengers will be affected due to 13 trains that have been cancelled. These passengers will have to pay through the nose as private bus operators are also charging around Rs 3,000 for one-side fare,” said Rail Yatri Sangh (RYS) president Brij Bhushan Shukla. Shukla slammed the railways for intimating the passengers at such short notice. “People had booked tickets well in advance and now will be put to grave inconvenience,” he said. tnn TRAINS CANCELLED * 02111 CSMT-Amravati (Oct 29 & 30) * 02112 Amravati–CSMT (Oct 28 & 29) * 02117 Pune-Amravati (Oct 27) * 02118 Amravati-Pune (Oct 28) * 02169 CSMT-Nagpur (Oct 29 & 30) * 02170 Nagpur-CSMT (Oct 28 & 29) * 02189 CSMT-Nagpur (Oct 29 & 30) * 02190 Nagpur-CSMT (Oct 28 & 29) * 02113 Pune-Nagpur (Oct 30) * 02114 Nagpur-Pune (Oct 29) * 02041 Pune-Nagpur (Oct 28) * 02042 Nagpur-Pune (Oct 29)  TRAINS DIVERTED  * 01137 Ahmedabad-Nagpur (Oct 27) via Bhusaval-Itarsi. * 01137 Nagpur-Ahmedabad (Oct 28) via Nagpur-Itarsi||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/several-mumbai-and-pune-trains-cancelled/articleshow/87289524.cms||---

Researchers found a basic difference between patients here and those reported in Western literature — they were younger and had more issues related with skin and mucus membrane (involvement of eyes, lips, tongue). Also, the majority of patients here were previously healthy children compared to a large number of children in the West with comorbidities. Also in patients here, doctors noticed changes in ECHO (heart scan), particularly in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, that remained in one-third of the patients but the vast majority completely normalised within the three-month follow-up period. In other words, an overwhelming majority of children who survive MIS-C recover without any long-term effects. “This is, so far, the largest published study on MIS-C from India from the first wave. MIS-C is a new disease recognised during the pandemic and an illness which affects previously healthy children who can become extremely ill very quickly. The good news is that prompt recognition and appropriate treatment allows for excellent recovery in the long term in the vast majority. Following the second wave, much higher numbers of MIS-C have been seen and managed across the state and country,” said Dr Suma Balan, pediatric rheumatologist at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Kochi, and one of the authors of the study, “Covid-19 related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C): A hospital-based prospective cohort study from Kerala, India”. It is published in BMJ Paediatrics. The study was done to understand the epidemiological factors, clinical profile and outcomes of Covid-19 related MIS-C, clinical profile across age groups, medium-term outcomes and parameters associated with disease severity. For the purpose of the study, 41 MIS-C patients treated at two tertiary care centres from March 2020 to April 2021 were enrolled. While 80% cases were previously healthy, rest had co-existing comorbidities with about 8% obese, one overweight, 7% having co-existing neurological disorders, two were on anti-epileptic therapy for seizure disorder and one had congenital hydrocephalus for which surgical intervention was done. One patient had a surgically-corrected congenital heart disease and another one had bronchial asthma that was controlled. A temporal link with Covid-19 infection was identified in all patients either in the form of serological testing or close contact with active Covid-19 case within preceding one month. The researchers were able to associate hyperferritinaemia with the requirement of mechanical ventilation in patients with MIS-C. “MIS-C has underlined the need for access to good paediatric intensive care services,” added Dr Suma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/young-healthy-children-at-risk-of-mis-c-in-state-study/articleshow/87289542.cms||Preetu Nair

After holding an urgent meeting with cops and the civic officials, the chairman of the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA), Firhad Hakim, on Tuesday said that cops have been asked to keep tabs on major hawking zones and that if any hawker is found without a mask, he will be barred from selling wares to people. “We want all hawkers to wear masks if they want to sell their wares. We have already taken up the matter with Kolkata Police and asked them to help the civic body enforce Covid protocols,” Hakim said. The hawkers of New Market, Gariahat and Hatibagan are the prime targets of a joint vigil by KMC and Kolkata Police, sources said. The civic brass has warned the vegetable and fish vendors at the KMC’s major markets against non-compliance with wearing masks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cop-kmc-lens-on-hawking-zones-for-mask-rule-breach/articleshow/87289520.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Progressive Pb Summit today, MSME bizmen list demands||Ludhiana: A day before the Progressive Punjab Summit, which is scheduled to be held in Ludhiana on Wednesday, city businessmen representing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) released a list of demands they want the state government to fulfil. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “MSME industry is in dire need of revival. For progress of this sector, the Punjab government must extend their support and take remedial steps without further delay. One of the major setbacks to the industry is the latest order of the urban and housing department in which it has been made mandatory that units can be set up at only those locations where the road size is minimum 33 feet and minimum size of industrial plot is 1.5 acres. These orders are giving sleepless nights to the industry as both these clauses are not practical and therefore these should be with immediate effect done away with. Besides this, electricity charges for the industry using connections of up to 100 KW should be reduced at the earliest to give a big boost to the MSME sector.”According to Pankaj Sharma, CICU general secretary, “It will be in the best interest of the state government, industry and traders if institutional tax is abolished. In addition to this, the enhancement charges levied by the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation for the already existing plots and chunks of land should be abolished. The allotment of plots at Dhanansu Focal Point should be at nominal rate for the MSMEs.”JS Bhogal, CICU publicity secretary, said, “Former chief minister Amarinder Singh had announced Rs 32 crore for complete facelifting of the Ludhiana Focal Points during his visit last year, but no significant development has taken place. The construction of roads is still pending in Focal Point areas and other development works, like proper and adequate street lighting, sewerage system and green belts, are yet to start. The government should speed up the work of development.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/progressive-pb-summit-today-msme-bizmen-list-demands/articleshow/87288275.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Untimely transfer of Tadoba FD raises eyebrows||Nagpur: The untimely transfer of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar to Mumbai has raised eyebrows. A year ago, Ramgaonkar was posted from Thane to Tadoba on promotion. He had joined Tadoba on August 13, 2020, and had hardly completed one year. Most of his tenure was marred by Covid restrictions and now when wildlife management issues gained momentum, he was transferred. “The midterm transfer is not only in violation of the state government guidelines but also a violation of the tripartite memorandum of understanding agreement between the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Maharashtra government and field director of TATR,” said wildlife conservationists. According to state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre, Article II of the agreement clearly states that the state government should post motivated officers as field directors with a proven track record, preferably trained in wildlife management, with a minimum tenure of three years which can be extended if the situation warrants. However, the forest department has been frequently violating this agreement with not even one field director completing his full three-year tenure. “Ramgaonkar is not a wildlife trained officer from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) but also a veterinary doctor,” said Dhotre, who has dashed a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding to cancel his transfer. Ramgaonkar is among the eight IFS officers transferred on Monday as joint secretary to Mantralaya, Mumbai, in place of Arvind Apte, who will retire on October 31. He will be replaced by S Ramesh Kumar, who was posted in Pune with the research wing. The sudden transfer of the present field director, who was in the process of preparing a 20-year-old vision document for TATR, has not augured well with wildlife conservationists. State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, “We must learn from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh how to groom officers and encourage them to complete their tenure as field director. Handling tiger reserves is a specialized job. In MP, field directors complete their tenure and are again posted in another tiger reserve.” “There are examples where a field director got promoted at the same post in Kanha Tiger Reserve by upgrading a post and Rajesh Gopal served for more than eight years as field director. Ramgaonkar had hardly completed one year,” Rithe said. “When it comes to posting of good officers, Vidarbha is unlucky. It seems the government is deliberately taking such ‘absurd’ decisions. It doesn’t want to post good officers in the region. A new officer will again take time to learn things, thus delaying the critical wildlife management issues like relocation, man-animal conflict, etc. The government should do a rethink,” said naturalist Himanshu Bagde.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/untimely-transfer-of-tadoba-fd-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/87289539.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

All the markets in this subdivision will be shut on October 28, 29 and 30. No crowding will be allowed and mask compliance will be of high priority, said Baruipur sub-divisional officer, Suman Poddar. In Sonarpur-Rajpur Municipality alone, more than 100 markets will be shut. Only medicine, paramedic, milk, ration and electric instruments shops will be out of the purview of the restrictions. These areas under Narendrapur, Sonarpur, Baruipur and Bakultala police stations will be under tight vigil so that people don’t move out of their houses unnecessarily and they wear masks. We hope to break the chain of transmission of the virus effectively,” added Poddar. Though the cases were low in Baruipur, the restrictions will be imposed there as well. Since Baruipur is the district headquarters, we need to protect the place with high priority, said an official. The total number of cases hovers around 200 following Durga Puja. “There will be a review of the situation on October 30 before the withdrawal of the restrictions. If there are fresh spikes, we need to impose further zone specific restrictions. The vehicular movement will be normal. Each zone will be demarcated with flex while entry and exit will be verified by enforcement agencies,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mkts-on-southern-fringes-to-be-shut-from-oct-28-to-30/articleshow/87289540.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

SP (city) Vikas Kumar said that an FIR is being registered at Jagdishpura police station on the basis of the complaint filed by BJP youth wing leader Gaurav Rajawat. "Legal action will be taken accordingly," the SP said, adding that police also received information that some people had "written anti-national messages" on WhatsApp after the match ended in a Pakistan win. The college administration, too, acted swiftly to suspend all three students who were doing their civil eengineering course (TOI is withholding their names) from the hostel as well as the institute on Monday. According to the notice issued by the dean of the hostels, Dr Dushyant Singh, the students were found to be involved in "indiscipline" by "posting status in favour of Pakistan" after the match on October 24. "Therefore, the hostel discipline committee has decided to suspend all three of them with immediate effect," a statement from the college said. Talking to TOI, chief proctor of the institute, Dr Ashish Shukla, said that the three Kashmiri students have apologised for their act. These students had got admission in the institute under Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS), which is available for class XII students from Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/3-kashmiri-students-booked-in-agra-for-pro-pak-slogans-after-indias-t-20-defeat/articleshow/87288282.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The deceased were identified as Ankit Kumar (19) of Shahpur Pipra in Sampatchak and Manish Kumar (18) of Harnichak in Phulwarisharif, both in Patna. The bike belonged to Ankit. He had picked up Manish and the two were going to attend a coaching class in Boring Road area. “However, Manish’s family members have alleged in the FIR that a four-wheeler had dashed against their bike from behind. The FIR has been lodged on the statement of Manish’s uncle Santosh Kumar,” Gardanibagh police station SHO Arun Kumar said. “Ankit died on the spot. Manish, who was riding pillion and flung down the bridge due to the intensity of the accident, had been rushed to a private hospital and then shifted to the PMCH, where he succumbed to his injuries,” the SHO said. The morning walkers spotted them lying in a pool of blood and informed the Gardanibagh police station at around 6am. The SHO said there was no eyewitness to the accident. Gandhi Maidan Traffic police station SHO Ashok Kumar said both the youths were not wearing helmet.

---||Mumbai||'WhatsApp chats are a year old, not linked to cruise case'||MUMBAI: Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi sought to distance his client Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, from the “unsavoury controversy” involving the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), its witnesses and politicians following his arrest and chose not to cast any motives on investigators. “Khan is not making any allegations against any individual or director in the NCB,’’ he said. The NCB had said a witness Prabhakar Sail's affidavit makes a “clear case” of alleged tampering by a manager of Khan to derail its probe and that bail should be denied for that reason alone. Rohtagi said he did not want to be sullied by this dispute. But he questioned the change in the stance of NCB, which had attributed the controversy to the personal vendetta of a politician and “now they are trying to rub it off on me by saying there is a manager Pooja.” Rohtagi said the NCB case against him on WhatsApp chats cannot be considered at the stage of a bail application, adding that the chats were at least a year old and do not pertain to the cruise. The NCB has put much emphasis on the nature of the chats to establish Khan’s role in the alleged conspiracy. It is a case of a 23-year-old, back last year from the US where he was studying, said Rohatgi. “With no possession or consumption, why has this boy been sent to 20 days in jail?” “I don't want to prejudice the case of A-2 (Arbaaz Merchant, Khan’s friend). He has, I believe, denied possession, but since nothing was found on me (Aryan Khan), you cannot take the case any further,” said Rohatgi. “This is not a case of any master-servant relationship that Khan has asked anyone to bring anything. I have no control over what is found in Arbaaz's shoe. Even if possession is assumed, it was 6 gm and maximum punishment is up to a year,” said Rohatgi who was assisted by Satish Maneshinde. There is no evidence of any “conspiracy” as alleged by NCB, to connect Khan with illicit trafficking or financing under section 27A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, which is not even what he has been booked for or charged with, said the senior counsel who flew down from London Monday. “The charge of conspiracy is to indirectly bring in section 27A of NDPS Act for illicit trafficking, that is what I gather though Aryan had not been charged with 27A,” said Rohatgi. He also pleaded for a compassionate attitude towards young drug users and for the law to treat them as victims rather than offenders. “In any case there is no material to show that (Aryan Khan) had any truck or meeting of mind with anyone else,” he said. “These are young people. The approach is to not put them in jail. The Act provides for immunity from prosecution if a person is a consumer,” said Rohatgi. “My case is that section 37 (a fetter on bail, requiring court to hold there is no prima facie case against accused to grant bail) doesn't apply because Section 27A (financing) doesn't apply,” said Rohatgi. The NCB which arrested Khan, Arbaaz and Munmun along with five others following the raid at the international cruise terminal had claimed to have found 5gm of contraband from the floor of Munmun’s cabin on the ship which was to set sail for Goa.  NCB had said all the accused were connected in “conspiracy”. It seized Khan’s mobile phone and opposed his bail citing chats with a “foreign national” to argue that it needed to be investigated. Rohatgi said, “There is no evidence. There may be some lady in London or somewhere and there are chats and the NCB is trying to link these to this case, without evidence.” He referred to a chart to show recoveries and arrest and said at best Khan can be connected to Merchant and another accused (Aachit Kumar). “But Aachit was not on the cruise. He was arrested on October 6, from his house.” When Justice Sambre asked about the chart, senior counsel Amit Desai appearing as lead counsel for Merchant along with advocate Taraq Sayed, said Kumar was “also a young, 22-year-old, from friend circle. Alleged chats were about online poker” adding “as you know online gaming has risen.” Rohatgi cited a series of judgments for bail and said Khan’s case was better than all these. Arguments will continue on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-whatsapp-chats-are-a-year-old-not-linked-to-cruise-case/articleshow/87290593.cms||Swati Deshpande

During a probe, it was found that the leopard died after getting stuck in a clutch wire noose set by the villagers to save their crop from wild animals. The post-mortem report of the wild cat is awaited. The seven men have been booked under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 at Vrindavan Kotwali police station. Officials said the animal apparently got stuck in the noose, which tightened and choked it after it tried to free itself. Om Prakash Sharma, section officer of the forest department, said a noose created from a clutch wire with strands of hair stuck to it was found near the leopard carcass in an agricultural field. “The villagers had planned to bury the carcass but could not do so as the information spread fast.” The carcass was sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly for an autopsy after preliminary examination. SP (city) MP Singh told TOI that no arrest has been made so far and investigations are on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/leopard-trapped-in-wire-noose-dies-7-booked/articleshow/87288302.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The court on Monday had convicted Papla for the murder of Bimla Devi. Mahendragarh police station had filed FIR number 376 on August 21, 2015, against Papla and his aides for allegedly killing Devi by firing over 20 shots at her. Papla was booked along with others under Sections 149 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy). Papla’s counsel, Kuldeep Bhargarh, said that he will contest the court’s sentence before the high court. He added that the court had acquitted six other accused in the case back in 2018. “No recovery was made from Papla in the case,” Bhargarh said, adding there were certain lacunas in the case. According to a senior official of Rajasthan police, who was part of the team that nabbed Papla from Maharashtra on January 28, earlier this year, Papla had shot dead Bimla Devi’s son Sandeep Fauji. “He was a wrestler before venturing into the world of crime. His mention was Shakti Gurjar. Shakti was killed by Sandeep Fauji in a suspected rivalry case in 2014.Papla decided to avenge his mentor’s killing and a year later shot dead Sandeep,” the official said, adding that Haryana police accused Papla of killing Sandeep’s mother Bimla Devi too. An outlaw of Haryana police, Papla was nabbed by Behror police station in Alwar on September 6. However, in the morning over a dozen heavily armed aides of Papla fired at Behror police station escaped with him after breaking the police lock-up. Rajasthan police had constituted a special team that nabbed him from Kolhapur in Maharashtra earlier this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/papla-gets-lifer-for-murder-of-65-yr-old-woman-in-haryana/articleshow/87289565.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Two-month extension of realty benefits||KOLKATA/ SILIGURI: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday announced further extension of stamp duty and circle rate sops for home buyers for two months. The CM said during the administrative meeting in north Bengal that these sops will be extended for two months till December 31. The 2% reduction in stamp duty and 10% cut in circle rates were initially offered for a limited period up to October 30 by the state government as part of this year’s budget sops. This has led to a 75% spike in Kolkata in the quarter ending in September over the same period last year. Credai West Bengal, the apex body for real estate developers, and Credai Bengal had earlier written to the state government, seeking an extension of the sop. The president of Credai West Bengal, Sushil Mohta, welcomed the move by saying that it will bring more revenue to the state coffer and will be a huge relief for home buyers. “This will also give a big boost to the real estate industry. We had requested for an extension and we are really thankful to CM for this,” he said. Credai National president H V Patodia also welcomed the move and said it is a good move for the real estate industry. The chairman of Ambuja Neotia Group, Harsh Neotia, said, “The registration process was clogged up with many people rushing for it. For industry, the announcement of the CM is a big relief,” he added. Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani said recently that the response to the stamp duty cut and circle rate reduction has been tremendous. An international property consultant, in his July-September report for 2021, had highlighted this 75% spike in Kolkata’s residential sales. Siddharth Pansari, director, Primarc group said, “The extension of registration at subsidized rate is a great progressive step by the government. It shall bring cheer and happiness to thousands of families and be of immense help to the real estate industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/2-mnth-extension-of-realty-benefits/articleshow/87289560.cms||Roshan Gupta

The petitioner stated that DVAC officials should conduct proper inquiry into such complaints against the government servants to eradicate corruption.He stated that for the purpose of monitoring and taking appropriate action on corruption and irregularities in government departments, state-level and district-level special flying squads are required in the DVAC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/corruption-achilles-heel-in-countrys-development-hc/articleshow/87290588.cms||Kaushik Kannan

According to doctors, quacks are “administering painkillers and steroids” to the patients suffering viral fever and dengue-like symptoms, causing adverse effects on their heart, liver and lungs. The number of patients admitted in critical condition has been increasing and nearly 30% of patients admitted at government hospitals are from rural areas, who were being treated by quacks before coming to the hospitals," said doctors. Meanwhile, with three more deaths in the past 24 hours, the toll in the Agra district increased to 120. Of these, 95 were children. Besides, in the last two months, 470 people were tested positive for dengue — the highest in the past ten years, health department officials confirmed. Moreover, owing to the lack of required arrangements and amenities at the government healthcare centres in rural areas, more than 5,000 patients are bed-ridden at their homes, and “a majority of them are dependent on quacks for their treatment”. Dr Neeraj Yadav, HoD, paediatrics, SN Medical College, said, “We are getting children in critical condition across the region, and in a majority of these cases, their families had taken them to a quack for their treatment. We have learnt from the attendants that five different types of antibiotics, steroids and painkillers are being administered. All these drugs are harmful to the children and do not require for their treatment.” IMA, Agra district president, Rajeev Upadhyaya too said that nearly 30% of patients admitted at hospitals were initially treated by quacks. “They came to the hospital only after their situation turned critical. All these patients were taking heavy doses of painkillers and steroids and developed complications related to the heart, liver and lungs. Some of them even suffered internal bleeding. We have updated the health department about the increasing number of such cases and demanded strict action against the quacks.” Virendra Chaudhary, a resident of Midkoli village under Bah block, said, “With government healthcare centres refusing to admit patients, a majority of them have left at the mercy of quacks. In the past ten days, seven people have died, while more than 300 are bed-ridden in the village.” AK Singh, additional director of the health department, said, “Our teams are taking action against the quacks. Over 30 illegal clinics have been sealed in the Agra division in the past two weeks. We have also asked village heads to report about illegal clinics. Besides, health staffers are conducting door-to-door surveys in rural areas to identify patients suffering from fever and help them get treatment. People are advised not to rely on unauthorised doctors and must consult a government doctor.” According to health department officials, more than 6,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in the Agra division in the past two months. Of these, 4,900 were in Firozabad district, 690 in Mathura, 470 in Agra and 210 in Mainpuri.

During his visit last week, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil had instructed police unit heads to contemplate opening police stations exclusively for women and by women. Kumar is also contemplating opening four ‘Bharosa cell’ units at different places in the city, in the backdrop of more than 1,000 domestic disputes being referred to the police department annually. The top cop has undertaken several measures to quell crime in the city, especially murders. “Though the number of murders did not rise in 2021, in around 65% of the cases, the perpetrator was a family member, friend or an acquaintance of the victim. Only 35% were by a rival or unknown people,” said the CP. Kumar has alerted senior officers to pay more attention to cases of domestic violence and marital disputes. He also shared statistics stating 20% of all murders were perpetrated from within the family. The statistics showed that 16 murders had taken place due to old rivalries, while as many were committed over love affairs and relationship stress. Around 21 murders took place over ‘trivial issues’ and 15 due to monetary reasons. In another measure, the CP urged supervisory-level officers to extend special support to four senior police station in-charges who are women. Kumar said Nagpur police recorded 51 arrests this year under the stringent Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act, which is highest in the state. As per records shared by Kumar, city police registered highest number of cases under the Arms Act (690 till September), Narcotics Act (216, with 286 arrested till September) and returned valuables worth record Rs21.42 crore, after detecting cases and recovering the stolen materials.

Petitioner M Pothumponnu, a resident of Kadavur taluk in Karur, said she and her daughter P Kaviya have been residing with her parents after her husband deserted her 14 years ago. Her daughter was presently studying in Class IX in Kadavur government high school.She stated that when she admitted her daughter to the elementary school, she had provided her name as her initial and it remains so in all government records including Aadhaar card. However, when her daughter applied to appear for a scholarship examination, the school authorities insisted that she mention her father’s name as initial. They said a similar issue would crop up when Kaviya appears for Class X public examination. Hence the petitioner moved court seeking to permit her to continue using her name as her daughter’s initial.Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed that the petitioner’s counsel produced a GO passed by the state government in 2003, wherein there are three options with regard to registering the name of a child at the time of school admission. One of these is to use the mother’s name as initial for the child. The petitioner had also enclosed the copy of the birth certificate in which the name of the girl was registered as Kaviya. The name of the mother and father of the girl was also recorded in the birth certificate. The Aadhaar card and school identity card bear the name of the student with her mother’s name as initial.Taking into account the above documents and the GO, the judge observed that the petitioner has made out a case to consider her representation favourably. Hence, the judge disposed of the petition directing the director of school education department and assistant director of government examinations at Karur to consider the representation and take appropriate action by taking into account the GO and the observations made by this court, within a period of 30 days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/pass-orders-on-plea-to-give-womans-name-as-initial-for-daughter-hc-to-authorities/articleshow/87290596.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The case of the prosecution is that the deceased P Anantharaman went to his native Thadangam village to attend the marriage of his employee Gurusamy on August 20. After attending the function, when he was returning to his car, the petitioners who came in two motorcycles hacked Anantharaman to death using billhooks. The petitioners had murdered Anantharaman due to previous enmity over the death of fourth accused Babu’s father Lakshmanan, the prosecution said. The Vachakarapatti police have registered a case and arrested Muthurakku, Mariappan and Vijayapandi on August 21, while Babu surrendered before the judicial magistrate court on August 24.The counsel for the petitioners submitted that Lakshmanan died in a motor vehicle accident. When Anantharaman was inquired in the case, he had clearly stated that there was no motive between him and Lakshmanan. Hence, the theory of the prosecution roping in the petitioners in the murder of Anantharaman, was not true.The counsel further submitted that Anantharaman was having several enemies and some other people might have murdered him. The petitioner are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution. However, the government advocate opposed the grant of bail to the petitioners as the investigation is yet to be completed. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/4-involved-in-village-panchayat-vice-prez-murder-case-get-bail/articleshow/87290594.cms||---

Despite the Pune airport’s closure and high air fares, lack of full train connectivity, and infrequent buses with Covid-19 restrictions, many families have decided to spend the festival away from the city on a much-needed vacation . Travel agents said that the trend to go on vacation after Diwali prevalent among Puneites has changed this year and many now have opted to spend the festival in holiday destinations. “In Pune, people generally prefer to holiday after Laxmi Puja and Padva. Now, many clients have booked their trips during the Diwali week. Queries and bookings have increased and while some are ready to spend some days in nearby locations like Nashik, Lonavla, Mahabaleshwar, Konkan, many have opted to go to Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. There are several queries and bookings too for international destinations like Dubai, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Austria and Turkey. Also, more people are contacting travel agents for their bookings rather than doing it themselves or booking via a website,” Nileshh Bhansali, a travel agent and director of Travel Agents Association of Pune, told TOI. Sudhir Behl, a businessman and his family, who have not gone on a vacation since last March, will spend Diwali in Jodhpur. “Our bookings stand from November 2 to November 6. We have never spent Diwali on a vacation, but then this time we decided to. We were able to save some money for the trip, thanks to being at home for one and half years. Even if the Pune airport would have been closed during our vacation dates, we would have found a way to go,” Behl, a Pashan resident, told TOI. Ankur Mitra had planned to go to his home in Siliguri in Bengal for Diwali, thought it best to get his tickets via a travel agent. “I chose a travel agent for the first time because amidst all uncertainties and regulations, as he will help us if a flight gets cancelled or with any other issue. I booked my ticket from October 27 and November 6 and once the Pune airport closed down, I contacted the agent and he did all the work on the re-routing. The hassles have been so much since more than a year that I just wanted to travel in peace. I have to fly from Mumbai but at least I didn’t have to make umpteen calls to the airlines,” Mitra said. Another travel company representative said that the airfares during this time were high, but that had not become a deterrent for the holiday seekers. Neelima Datta and her family, who will be spending their Diwali at a resort in Mahabaleshwar, said that the cost factor didn’t bother them. “We are staying for five days and the tariff is huge. But then, a vacation is extremely important and we can always pay upfront and convert it into an EMI. My kids desperately want to go out,” Datta, an entrepreneur, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/vacation-travel-takes-off-despite-pune-airport-closure-high-fares/articleshow/87291459.cms||Joy Sengupta

The demand of the representative of Tamil Nadu was to fix the water level at 142ft. Responding to this, the Kerala representative reminded that in 2018 the Supreme Court had directed to fix the water level in the reservoir at 139.99ft. Additional chief secretary T K Jose, who represented Kerala, said the situation is more serious now than it was in 2018. “If water is released from the Mullaperiyar dam, Idukki reservoir cannot store more water as the water level in Idukki is near to full reservoir level now. In the present situation, Tamil Nadu should draw more water from Mullaperiyar and store it in Vaigai and Madurai dams,” he said. Apart from Jose, Sandeep Saxena (additional chief secretary, Tamil Nadu) and central water commission member and Mullaperiyar high-power committee chairman Gulshan Raj attended the meeting. According to sources, the high-level meeting has also decided to follow the rule curve for Mullaperiyar dam. A detailed report on the rule curve was submitted before the Supreme Court last week. As per the rule curve, the upper rule level for the October 21-30 period has been fixed at 138ft. The maximum storage level is 142ft. As per the decision, the water will be released when the water level reaches 138ft. Meanwhile, Idukki district collector Sheeba George said that all steps have been taken and various departments are put on alert over the increase in the water level in Mullaperiyar dam. After a review meeting at Vandiperiyar on the precautionary steps to be taken, she said, “3,220 people in Peermade, Udumbanchola, and Idukki taluks have to be shifted temporarily.” “BSNL will make alternative arrangements in case of disruption in power supply. Control rooms will be opened by irrigation department and fire and rescue services. The forest department has opened two control rooms in Vallakadavu and Vandiperiyar,” the collector said. Two deputy collectors have been assigned with the special duty on Mullaperiyar. There will be night patrolling by the police. The grama panchayats should ensure the support of the rapid response team. Buildings have been identified to be functioned as rehabilitation camps and teams will be deputed for the security and health needs in the camps. The district collector ordered the removal of a bridge at Nooradi which had collapsed in the 2018 floods and prevented the smooth flow in Periyar. The water level in the Mullaperiyar dam remained at 137.60ft on Tuesday. Tamil Nadu was drawing water at 2,200 cfs and the inflow was the same at 7pm. Meanwhile, the water level in Idukki reservoir decreased to 2,398.6ft by Tuesday afternoon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/fix-dam-water-level-at-137ft-says-kerala/articleshow/87289595.cms||---

Tikait's statement, made in Baghpat on Tuesday, soon went viral on social media. The BKU leader went on to say that the Indian team was made to lose the match "so that some people can burst crackers to celebrate the Pakistan win, which would lead to Hidnu-Muslim clashes that would eventually bring votes for the BJP". “I haven’t seen the match but have heard from the villagers that the Modi government did it. This will make some people burst crackers and some people will insult Indian team players. All this was told to me by villagers,” said Tikait.

Venkatesan said Jambusaria had written that “realising the power of our mother tongue Hindi, ICAI is trying to incorporate more use of Hindi into its work culture.” The MP said this hurts the sentiments of people in non-Hindi speaking states and is not in tune with the ethos of linguistic pluralism of our country.Hindi is not the mother tongue of neither the entire community of Chartered Accountants nor of all those availing their services or the crores of people of the country who depend on ICAI’s work to assess accounts of any company or an individual. Only 12 of the 35 states and Union Territories had chosen Hindi as the first choice of communication, he said. A majority of the rest chose English according to the results of the 2011 language Census released in 2018. “ICAI is an institution created by an Act of Parliament and it has to abide by the law of the land and acting contrary to it is utter violation of the said provisions of the constitution,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mp-asks-icai-chief-to-withdraw-comment-on-hindi-imposition/articleshow/87290603.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Aryan Khan case: Two co-accused granted bail||MUMBAI: While the Bombay high court is yet to decide on the bail pleas of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and two others in the cruise liner drug bust case, a special court hearing Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) cases on Tuesday released two of the arrested accused on bail. Manish Rajgaria (30) and Avin Sahu (30) are the first to be granted bail in the case. Special NDPS court judge VV Patil granted bail of Rs 50,000 to the duo, both guests on board the cruise liner, who were arrested on October 4, the day the ship returned from a tour of Goa. The NCB had claimed they seized 2.4 grams of ganja from Rajgaria. Sahu, a jewellery businessman, was accused of consuming the contraband twice on board the vessel. Advocate Taraq Sayed, appearing for Rajgaria, submitted that the quantity seized was in any case small enough to merit bail. Denying a charge of conspiracy, he argued that the agency has not shown any nexus between the accused. “These accused were travelling on the cruise independently. For convenience, the NCB has registered only one complaint,” Sayyed said. He said there is no evidence that drugs were found on Rajgaria. Sahu's lawyer Sana Raees Khan argued that there was no possession. She said he cannot be incarcerated further on the pretext of a common thread of investigation. Conspiracy cannot be assumed through unconnected facts or in the absence of a link or independent material against him. She said recoveries from other accused were independent recoveries. Khan said section 27-A of the NDPS Act which provides punishment for financing was not invoked against Sahu, and hence he cannot be treated on the same footing as Aryan Khan and others. Defending Rajgaria, advocate Ajay Umapati Dubey said the agency did not find 2.4 grams of ganja in his possession. “The panchnama states that ganja was handed over by Security Officer Patil from the cruise,” he said adding under Section 50 of NDPS Act, the accused should have been searched in the presence of a magistrate or gazetted officer. He also said the remand report reveals that recoveries effected at the alleged spot were independent recoveries and that Rajgaria had no connection to it. Opposing Rajgaria’s bail plea, the prosecution denied there was any irregularity in the panchnama. In Sahu’s case, the prosecution said the law was clear that even if there is no recovery, it does not entitle an accused to bail. A detailed order is awaited.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-2-co-accused-in-aryan-khan-case-are-the-first-to-get-bail/articleshow/87290611.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Hyderabad||Stop AP’s extension of irrigation facilities: Telangana||HYDERABAD: Raising objections over certain components pertaining to Nagarjuna Sagar Left Canal (NSLC) mentioned in the gazette notification issued by the Jal Shakti ministry in July this year, the Telangana government urged the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to remove the irrigation facilities extended in the recent past from the gazette notification. The state government said since water allocation in AP areas was up to only Kattleru river, the notification should be restricted to that till the finalisation of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-II. Those areas in AP should be irrigated through alternative sources such as Chintalapudi Lift Irrigation Scheme, it said. In a letter to KRMB chairman, state irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar said the NSLC catchment areas have been modified by united AP governments from time to time, disregarding the lower Krishna project (Nandikonda) since 1952, which has become a disadvantage for Telangana. “Unfortunately after 1956 re-organisation of the states, the canal was extended to include 1.3 lakh acres ayacut of AP without an agreement. In addition, the then AP government further extended left canal beyond Kattaleru river and the areas further extended from 1.3 lakh acres to 3.78 lakh acres,” he said. He added the Telangana areas were reduced from 6.60 lakh acres to 6.02 lakh acres. KWDT-I said priority should be given to the in-basin areas for allocation of future uses but it was not followed, Muralidhar said. In another letter, state government complained that AP was going ahead with Pinnapuram pumped storage hydel power project, which is based on Krishna river water. He said though the state complained about this to the board, there was no response.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-stop-aps-extension-of-irrigation-facilities/articleshow/87289597.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Nagpur||VC’s move to grant autonomy to depts under fire from academics||Nagpur: Vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari’s move to grant autonomy to its 43 departments has come under fire from several academics, including its Management Council (MC) members. It has also come to fore that none of the department heads had asked for autonomy, but the VC had apparently taken a decision on his own. Over a month after the VC orally informed the departments’ heads about his decision, no official notification was issued till date, they claimed. According to them, the move would spell doom, as all the departments are operating with less than 50% teaching and non-teaching staff. If this is not enough, a majority of them badly lacked infrastructure like laboratories, library and equipment, and even the classrooms to accommodate all students, as per the UGC norms. Chaudhari did not pick up TOI’s calls nor respond to its text messages. “The VC seems to have taken the decision in haste, without routing the proposal to statutory bodies like Academic and Management councils and Senate. Such important decisions cannot be taken without proper discussions and deliberations. He may have probably, buoyed by ‘A’ grade granted by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). When we asked him whether the Academic Council had approved it, he said, he had taken the decision under special powers granted to VC as per Section 12(7) of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016,” senior MC member Rajesh Bhoyar told TOI. The senior academic, having vast experience on working with almost all NU statutory bodies, demanded that the same stringent conditions should be set for the NU departments for offering autonomy, like for affiliated colleges. “You harass the affiliated colleges by putting all checks and balances before according the autonomous status to them. Autonomy can’t be granted overnight as per anyone’s whims and fancies. It needs to be achieved in a certain period of time and by fulfilling other requirements like full time faculty and non-teaching staff, well equipped laboratories and other facilities like libraries, PhD guides and others.” Head of NU’s Political Science department Mohan Kashikar too, raised doubts on implementation of the autonomy. “We have seven vacant posts of teachers out of nine. We badly lacked non-teaching staff. We don’t have basic infrastructure like libraries and even classrooms are highly inadequate to accommodate the large number of students. In such scarce manpower and conditions, how are we going to set the papers, conduct examinations and declare results on our own.” He added about 60% teaching posts were vacant across all NU departments and in such conditions, how the Board of Studies (BOS), required for framing syllabus would be constituted. “Though the decision is good, its implementation would be a serious problem in absence of the required number of teaching and non-teaching staff. None of the departments have sent the proposal for getting autonomous status. Such status cannot be accorded overnight without wider consultations. The government needs to make amendments in the 2016 Act, if university departments are to be made autonomous,” he told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/vcs-move-to-grant-autonomy-to-depts-under-fire-from-academics/articleshow/87289593.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

My son’s school has told us they will reopen only the week after Diwali. Even then, it is not compulsory to go to school. We don’t want to rush to buy the uniform as last year we purchased uniform which went to waste as it doesn’t fit him now,” said K Geetha, mother of a Class V student. While a few schools are looking to also allow colour dresses initially, most schools are keen to have students come in uniform as usual.“We informed our students to keep uniforms ready as soon as the school reopening was announced by the government so that it gives enough time for parents. Uniform gives the feeling of going to school. Students desperately need to get back to school routine and uniform is also a part of it,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation.Meanwhile, with no sales of uniforms last year due to closure of schools, garment traders who sell readymade uniforms said the business is nowhere close to how it was before the Covid-19 pandemic. “Our shops usually get flooded before school reopening but now it is not so. Parents have been coming in to buy uniforms during the past month but are less in number. Last year, we hardly had any sales. The cost has also increased by Rs 10-20 especially due to rise in fuel prices,” said V Kesavan, proprietor of a shop on Kamarajar Salai which sells all school uniforms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/uniform-sales-yet-to-pick-up-as-parents-remain-apprehensive/articleshow/87290609.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The bench asked the petitioner’s counsels — Chandrashekhar Sakhare and Priti Phadke — to take necessary steps for compliance with the PIL rules. Before adjourning the hearing till November 17, the judges granted them leave to amend the petition, including the prayer clause. The petitioner contended that arrests and harassment of women from the area amount to criminal trespass. “Residing in their small rooms is their fundamental right and they cannot be prevented from it,” said the petitioner. “Their right to reside in the area cannot be taken away and no raids can be conducted at the places where they reside,” he said. Shahu pointed out that hundreds of commercial sex workers (CSWs) have been left with no means of livelihood after the CP’s action. He added there was no reason for suddenly closing the area, which has been in existence for hundreds of years.

---||Goa||Goa: Four months after tribal welfare minister’s promise, nothing’s changed in Karla||MARGAO: Four months ago, tribal welfare minister Govind Gaude, during his visit to the remote hill-top village of Karla, held aloft a promise of undertaking several infrastructure works under the government’s tribal sub-plan, including an access road to the village. In the village, located in the inner recesses of the Netravali forests of Sanguem, 94-year old Bhomo Gaonkar, who has been battling sepsis above his left ankle, had then dismissed Gaude’s assurance as a politician’s empty rhetoric. “We have heard plenty of such assurances in the past,” Bhomo had then told TOI. “We know this is election time, and they will give the same assurances again. Had they made this road as they had earlier assured, I wouldn’t have had to suffer like this. I am now only waiting for the road to Vaikunth (death, figuratively).” Bhomo wasn’t entirely wrong. When queried over the fate of the promises he had dished out at Karla on an overcast June morning, Gaude told TOI last week that the hotmixing of the road will be taken up soon, now that the monsoon is over. “Once the road is done, other issues related to power and water supply can be taken up,” he said. TOI, in its edition dated July 4, had highlighted the woes of Karla residents. Though blessed with nature's bounty, Karla lacks any basic modern-day facilities — not even a motorable access road to this village. A roughly 4km-long narrow, steep and winding dirt road from Cajur, situated at a relatively lower height, leads to Karla. However, maneuvering the road is not a mean task — the huge craters that have developed throughout the road make even a motorbike ride a terribly-risky affair. The nearest hospital is the primary health centre at Quepem or Curchorem, nearly 25km away. With no easy access to healthcare facilities, the nonagenarian Bhomo was compelled to rely on traditional herbal medicine prepared by his wife to treat his sepsis. “The wound is now healing slowly,” says Bhomo, “and I am able to take a few steps with great difficulty, but whatever happened to the promise of the road our sarkar had promised?” In the absence of a motorable road, villagers are rendered helpless in times of medical emergency as no ambulance can travel up this road. The nearest primary school for the students here is at Cajur, and the nearest high school at Maina. High school students from Karla, numbering around ten, take an alternative route to get to their school — a pathway through the dense forests that takes them over forty minutes to climb down and an hour-and-a-half to trudge up. It gets riskier during the monsoon, as the pathway invariably gets flooded, and the rocks, slippery. For higher secondary and college education, as well as for locals travelling for their weekly shopping, they walk along the 4km dirt road to Cajur, from where they get college buses or public transport to Tilamol (20km) or Curchorem (25km). The totally tribal-inhabited hamlet, which comes under the Caurem-Pirla panchayat, has a population of over 100, and about 20 houses. Power outages, which are frequent owing to tree falls that snap power lines, last for hours, making studying at night nearly impossible. A distant well is the only source of drinking water for the village.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/four-months-after-mins-promise-nothings-changed-in-karla/articleshow/87290614.cms||Govind Maad

Teachers and paediatricians reassured that while the task won’t be easy, students can adapt to the new normal. “We believe that students can adapt to wearing masks and other Covid-19 safety SOPs. Government schools have been provided with free supply of masks for students and sanitizers and thermal scanners. Children also closely see what happens outside and understand that wearing masks is normal. Children have the ability to learn quickly,” said M Porchelvan, district secretary, Tamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Koottani, Madurai. At the same time, teachers admitted that it will take some time to teach children about Covid-19 safety. “Children may think of wearing masks in a playful way. Not all parents would have strictly made their children wear masks when going out. So it is teachers who have to keep reinforcing wearing masks until they make it a habit. Rather than lessons, the focus of first few days back in school should be on making children learn to follow the SOPs,” said K Nagalakshmi, a primary school teacher. Dr S Senthil Kumar, paediatric intensivist, Meenakshi mission hospital and research centre, said more than in school, there is more concern over whether children will wear masks when they are outside. “Around 70% to 80% enforcement of mask wearing is definitely possible in schools. A simple cloth mask is enough for young children. Children are not yet likely to have full-day classes so it won’t be much of an issue for them to tolerate wearing it for a few hours,” he said. The paediatrician further said that physical contact between children is also unavoidable in school but ensuring hand hygiene would be enough to keep safe. Parents meanwhile said that while they are not against sending their children to school, there is still a risk of Covid-19 and are hoping the safety precautions will keep kids safe. “Schools cannot ensure 100% safety and even if I make my daughter wear a mask properly, we cannot be sure if other children will follow. We just have to have faith in the schools and do what we can from our side while they are home,” said N Rajasekar, father of a Class II student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/making-primary-kids-mask-up-maintain-hygiene-a-challenge/articleshow/87290607.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Police have erected watchtowers in the Masi streets where most of the crowds converge for shopping. “100 additional closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are also in place for the past one week to monitor the crowds. Crime and law and order teams have also been deployed with additional police strength,” said P Thangadurai, deputy commissioner of police, Madurai south.Police strength has been focused in town limits, including Southgate and Thideer Nagar, with additional strength from armed reserve, delta teams. Around 50-60 additional personnel are deployed under these police stations. Security measures are set to remain strengthened until Diwali day. Helpdesks have also been set up near watchtowers to help public report any crime or help those, especially children or elderly who may have got lost in the crowd.Meanwhile, traffic personnel are deployed to regulate vehicular movement and prevent crowding in the areas. To reduce traffic and crowding on Nethaji Road and West Masi Street, the stretch of road from Jhansi Rani Park and the Murugan temple has been made one-way from Monday. A traffic police official also said that parking has not been allowed on Masi streets and with crowds increasing arrangements for temporary parking areas nearby are likely to be made.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/security-upped-in-commercial-hubs-as-diwali-shoppers-surge/articleshow/87290612.cms||---

Addressing the business community of the state at the Times of India's Industrial Icons-2021, Meena said RIICO was launching a record number of industrial areas which was never done in the past. “Not only we have launched record number of industrial areas, but RIICO has also sold highest number of industrial plots, over 2,600, last year. This shows the interest of the investors in the state,” added Meena. The minister said all the industrial plots were sold through an e-auction process to ensure maximum transparency. He also spoke about the upcoming ‘Invest Rajasthan’ Summit scheduled in January. “We have seen how the investment MoUs signed during the previous government's summit failed to materialise on the ground. That's why we are ensuring that before signing MoUs all approvals are given and the investments are realised on the ground,” said Meena.Meena also said how the MSME Act has changed the ease of doing business paradigm in the country. “Through the Act, Rajasthan government ensured that no prior permission are required for a three years to start a business in the state for three years. This has changed the thinking in the country,” added Meena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/industrial-areas-will-come-up-in-each-block-of-raj-says-industries-minister/articleshow/87290608.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The increased portion will all come in the offer-for-sale (OFS) component with existing shareholders selling more of their shares. The size of the primary offering will remain unchanged at Rs 8,300 crore, while the secondary sale size will now be Rs 10,000 crore. The biggest IPO in the history of Indian capital markets so far has been that of Coal India (CIL), which raised Rs 15,475 crore in 2010. The Paytm issue, expected to hit the market next month, will see the shares of One 97 Communications (Paytm's parent company) being listed both on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. Even before the increase in size, Paytm's offering was the largest in India. According to sources, Paytm has decided to hike the issue size after receiving feedback that there is enough of an appetite for the company's shares at the right price. Nearly half of the offer for sale is by Ant Financial and the remaining by Alibaba, Elevation Capital, SoftBank and other existing shareholders. Investment bankers are understood to have advised the company to offer the shares in a price band to enable price discovery. The company has said that it has turned contribution margin-positive. The contribution margin gives an indication of the profits made by the company from each product or service after deducting the variable component of the company's cost. This improved from a loss of Rs 1,998 crore in FY19 to a profit of Rs 362 crore in FY21. Food delivery platform Zomato is currently valued at Rs 1,06,302 lakh crore. Based on its proposed IPO, Paytm's valuation has been speculated at around $20 billion, or Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Paytm is positioning itself as a multi-platform payments service provider through e-wallets, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform, postpaid, credit cards, point-of-sales terminals and all-in-one QR codes. Earlier this year, BillDesk, which processes payments for e-commerce transactions, was purchased by Prosus for $4.7 billion. In its offer document, Paytm has, quoting RedSeer, said that it has a 40% share of the customer-to-merchant mobile payments market. In terms of customer-to-merchant e-wallet transactions, its share is even higher at 65-70%. Paytm Payments Bank, a joint venture between Vijay Shekhar Sharma and One 97 Communications, has issued approximately 90 lakh FASTags, with a market share of 28%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/ipo/more-demand-paytm-hikes-ipo-size-to-18k-cr/articleshow/87292606.cms||---

According to SP Keshav Kumar, the Mawana circle officer's cook has been booked under rape charges. The accused, around 50 years of age, is known to the family of one of the girls for three decades. According to the complaint lodged by the father of one of the victims, his daughter (11) and her friend (13) were alone in his house on Monday when the accused entered and tried to molest them. When the girls started screaming, their neighbours rushed in for help and caught the cook red-handed. As the news spread, members of right wing organisations also staged a demonstration outside the local police station, demanding immediate arrest of the accused who belonged to another community.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/senior-cops-cook-booked-for-molesting-2-minor-girls/articleshow/87288381.cms||Ishita Mishra

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat, state Congress president Girish Chodankar, working presidents Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and Aleixo Sequeira and Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao attended the meeting, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, to discuss a poll strategy for five states including Goa that go to polls early next year. “An overall mood is in favour of the alliance. We want to win the elections,” the functionary said, but declined to spell out when the announcement would happen. “We’ve discussed alliances and how to get various parties on board and win in Goa.” Asked which were the parties Congress is keen to join hands with, he said, “whoever has approached” Congress is being considered, and the decision will be made after the core party leadership discusses the issue threadbare. Delays on Congress’ part in starting alliance talks with GFP have been due to internal differences, as a few were averse to GFP chief Vijai Sardesai's approach, as well as apprehension that he might ask for more seats.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nupur Satija’s arrest, drug seizure illegal, says lawyer||MUMBAI: Seeking bail for Nupur Satija (29) in the cruise liner drugs bust case, the defence told the special NDPS court on Tuesday that the alleged seizure of ecstasy tablets (MDMA), totally weighing 1.59 gm, from the room occupied by her, is an illegal seizure as the mandatory procedure was not followed. “The search of the cabin, personal effects and personal search of Nupur was effected by the panch witness. As per the law, a panch is not empowered to search and recover contraband. It has to be done by officers empowered by the NDPS Act. They have to be of and above the rank of intelligence officer,” Satija’s advocate Ayaz Khan submitted. Pointing out to alleged illegalities in Nupur’s arrest, he also argued that the investigating agency had entered the room post sunset at 7.50pm and exited along with her around 9.30pm. “Her movements thereafter were restricted and she was taken into the NCB office. This amounts to arrest under the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code). The Bombay high court has held that such arrest of a woman after sunset is illegal,” Khan submitted. He said that her formal arrest on October 3 was also made by a male officer which is against the provisions of law. “If the seizure is illegal, there is no question of further investigations,” Khan said. He also said that the alleged seizure was from a room, and not from Nupur’s personal possession. Denying that there was anything collective between the eight arrested accused who were the ship’s guests, he further said that the ship had more than 1,000 rooms and over 2,500 guests. “Nupur is only being charged for intermediate quantity of MDMA for possession and consumption. Hence, the bar under section 37 of the NDPS Act is not attracted to her case,” Khan said. Under section 37, no person accused under 27A (illicit trafficking and harbouring of offenders) or for offences involving commercial quantity can be given bail unless the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds. The prosecution will now submit arguments on the plea.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-nupur-satijas-arrest-drug-seizure-illegal-says-lawyer/articleshow/87290645.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot accuses BJP-RSS of making tempting offers to woo the voters||UDAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot accused BJP-RSS of influencing voters by making tempting offers in the poll-bound assembly segments —Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad — on Tuesday. While talking to mediapersons in Dhariawad, Gehlot said that since BJP is losing elections, in desperation they have sent their workers in villages to influence them. “You know what they do in villages? What kind of talks do they have with them? We all know the tempting offers they make,” said Gehlot. The statement came during his campaign tour in Lasadiya, Matasula and Mungana in Dhariawad, and Kurabad in Vallabhnagar for Khetsingh Meena and Preeti Shaktawat contesting from Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar respectively. Prior to addressing his rallies, Gehlot, with a slight shift in the schedule, visited the house of former MLA Dhariawad Gautam Meena, who died of Covid to express condolences, which angered the BJP leaders. They called it a ‘political gimmick’. “Even if Meena’s son Kannahiyalal Meena would have been contesting the polls, I would have visited his residence to pay my respects. I can say that we tried our level best to save the life of Gautam Meenaji. They (BJP leaders) didn’t know that I had spoken to the son of the deceased MLA at the time he was admitted to the hospital. Also, I spoke to the doctors but was not able to save him,” said Gehlot. Gehlot, while addressing the meetings at these places, urged the people gathered, to vote in favour for the Congress candidates in both the constituencies. He stated two important reasons for voting in favour of Congress: The first reason is the developmental work that has been done by the present government in less than three years while in power. Secondly, he said, voting for Congress candidates in this election will help in building up confidence among the people and administration. If the Congress candidate wins, it will give a message to the tehsildars, SDOs and the village-level officials that the mandate is with the Congress government, resulting in expediting the developmental works in the rural areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-accuses-bjp-rss-of-making-tempting-offers-to-woo-the-voters/articleshow/87290617.cms||---

The contractors come under the association of hiring of equipment (HOE) contractors. The machines are engaged in removal of earth to reach coal seams in the mines. They had already sent a notice for indefinite stoppage of work from November 1, if escalation in fuel rates was not compensated by revising the formula. Similar notices were sent to other subsidiaries of Coal India Limited (CIL) also. In case the strike takes place, there is a “strong likelihood of its impact on coal production in the entire country”, said the contractors. A meeting was held at the WCL headquarters on Monday, after which the contractors held another meeting to plan their strategy. It has been decided to hold a meet of all the CIL contractors on October 30 and go ahead with the plans. Lokesh Jain from the Nagpur unit of the association said, “The contractors have been suffering daily losses running into crores. This is because only 30% of the diesel price escalation is passed on under the existing terms of the tender. This is inadequate due to the steep price rise, and contractors’ margins have been eroded. They are heading towards a cash crunch and may run out of funds for buying fuel in a few days. This would bring work to a standstill.” At present, diesel stands at Rs105 per litre. According to the tender conditions, a price hike up to 30% is allowed. However, the prices have gone up by 67% of the base rates of diesel, says the letter handed over to the WCL chairman and managing director (CMD) on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/stoppage-of-work-inevitable-say-wcl-contractors-after-talks-with-co-fail/articleshow/87289601.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Hyderabad||SCB, GHMC merger must to ensure even development||Secunderabad Cantonment forms an island in the GHMC area like Lesotho in Africa. The Cantonment has been getting step-motherly treatment from a development point of view. In addition to the problem of stunted growth, the Cantonment also suffers from a plethora of issues. Having little muscle to support itself in the administration and upkeep, SCB has to depend on GHMC for all infrastructural support such as garbage disposal and drinking water among others. These problems are conspicuously visible in the shabby maintenance of roads, lakes, playgrounds and other amenities. Not a single road in the cantonment has been developed since it was formed. To add fuel to fire, the existing roads are being closed almost at the drop of a hat. The road closure problem has come to the fore over the last decade, which was unseen and unheard of, ever before. The apathy can be seen by the 10 lakh denizens commuting through the cantonment, daily. It is an acknowledged fact that the Secundeabad Cantonment Board works as a supplementary to LMA, which has little concern for the development of the area. The biggest problem has been the stunted growth in and around the north east part of Hyderabad. For example, one can see the spurt in real estate development in the entire city, leaving the north-central and northeast to a diminutive growth. To make matters worse, when all the state and central taxes have been merged and a GST has been launched, we are yet to do away with the entry tax of the cantonment. To ensure an even development of this historical city with a lot of tradition, it will be only wise to merge the cantonment into the GHMC. If one can draw a parallel to the corporate world, an M&A will be an appropriate solution.

The government had promised a new building at OGH in 2015, but over six years, later not even the foundation stone has been laid. After several protests, only the 100-year-old ‘Old block’ of the OGH was shut. In 2018, after a massive protest, the building was finally shut down and wards were shifted to the less dilapidated Quli Qutub Shah building. Currently, a majority of the wards are operating from the emergency block (another 50-55 year old building) and the Quli Qutub Shah building which is older. Surgeries are being conducted at a newer GHMC building. “We have been requesting the government to take a decision, whether to preserve the old building or demolish it. At least construction of the new building should begin,” said Dr G Srinivas, general secretary, Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-building-at-ogh-still-a-distant-dream/articleshow/87290552.cms||---

Angry over the decades of neglect, doctors wore helmets to work on Tuesday and also submitted a representation to hospital authorities. Incidentally, the helmet protest (wearing helmet at work) to show how unsafe it is to be in OGH began in 2018 after three senior doctors narrowly escaped a mishap. On Monday, a junior doctor suffered minor head injuries after the fan fell on her. She is currently under observation. This is not the first such incident at OGH, where previously chunks of plaster had fallen off and injured doctors and patients. OGH is caught in a battle between heritage activists and doctors over razing some heritage structures on the premises to make way for new buildings. While the OGH old building (over 100 years old) had seens chunks of plaster coming crashing down over half-a-dozen times in the past, this incident happened at the department of dermatology in a relatively new building but still in a dilapidated condition. There were three other doctors in the room, but they had a narrow escape. “Not just the doctor who suffered minor injuries in the incident, all doctors are now scared to work in the building. Today, doctors even wore helmets to mark their protest apart from holding a silent protest. This particular building, where the incident happened, was built in the 1960s and although its not as bad as the old building (that has been shut), it too is dilapidated. It’s not safe for patients or doctors and there is a lot of concern of lack of protection,” Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association (TJUDA) secretary J Vijay told TOI. In fact, small chunks of plaster peeling off was pretty routine, claim doctors. “We would like to inform you that such incidents have now become a day-to-day event in the hospital. We are grateful that none of these incidents which occurred so far have caused grievous injury to the working staff or patients, but it would not be long when one such incident might happen and the authorities would be left with no answer,” TJUDA said in a representation to hospital superintendent Dr B Nagender, asking the authorities to attend to the issue “as working with life at risk is bound to hamper patient care and delivery of duties.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/docs-stage-helmet-protest-over-crumbling-infra-at-ogh/articleshow/87290547.cms||---

The list of proposed events include Nyingma Monlam Chenmo (prayer for world peace) and the International Tipitaka Chanting ceremony, the two popular annual events organised at Bodh Gaya. During the 2020-21 tourist season, no annual event was organised at Bodh Gaya due to the Covid-induced lockdown. BTMC member secretary Nangzey Dorjee and the chief monk of Mahavihara, Bhikkhu Chalinda, jointly released the list of annual events to be organized till March next year. The events will begin with robe offering ceremony on October 31, which will be organised by Mahabodhi Mahavihara.

Culprits include the once-humble LPG cylinder, a bicyclist on campaign trail and even Covid itself. The Huzurabad campaign has the hawk-eyed cops and election officials doing all and then some to keep the peace. But in their bid to ensure that no one fuels a fire, a fuel too has come under fire — LPG cylinder in this instance. With the TRS and BJP sparring over rising prices, an LPG cylinder was the red rag that the officials did not want. So, when the flying squad saw a thermocol sheet gas cylinder with the words “Gas Dhara Rs 1,000 rupayalu penchinaru uyyalo (Gas price is hiked to Rs 1,000)” placed near Bathukamma Chavadi, they removed it before it could ‘disturb public peace’. A criminal case was booked against unknown individuals under IPC Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with an intent to cause riot). In another instance, a bicyclist was booked for campaigning ‘without permission’. “Mahabub Subani (67) was nabbed campaigning for BJP on his cycle with a BJP flag without any permission from returning officer. He violated the model code of conduct,” an official at the Jammikunta Town police said. In the era of pandemic, could the virus be far away from the poll cases. Hardly. The victim was the former health minister and now BJP candidate Eatala Rajender. Eatala, who never got tired of appealing to the public to wear masks and follow Covid-19 protocols, faces a police case for not following Covid-19 norms during campaigning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/lpg-too-under-police-lens-as-poll-fuels-unusual-cases/articleshow/87289692.cms||Srinath Vudali

Reports of 64 samples sent for genome sequencing two months ago that were recently received show that 12 were the delta variant and 52 were its sub-lineages. “Since the delta mutation is still present in the community, we cannot rule out the possibility of clusters and outbreaks,” he said. “These may occur if we drop our guard. We must continue to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he told TOI. The state’s vaccination coverage is very good, so even if there is an outbreak, there is the possibility that critical cases and hospital admissions may be less, he said, appealing to people to get fully vaccinated at the mega-vaccination drive on Sunday across 200+ centres. “Most of the deaths that took place during October were among the unvaccinated,” he said. TOI reported on Tuesday that 92% of those who died in the second wave to Covid-19 hadn’t received a single dose of the vaccine. The state has reported only one case of the delta-plus variant till date, while the delta variant accounts for 60% (271 cases) of the 452 samples received from genomic sequencing lab. There are 362 reports pending. The state sends samples every 15 days to the national centre for cell science, Pune. “The samples are sent from all categories — vaccinated, unvaccinated, critical patients, those who expired, as well as random samples,” Betodkar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/delta-variant-still-present-in-goa-govt/articleshow/87290652.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Hyderabad||Red gram & oil prices give heartburn to households in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Rising prices of essential commodities over the past one year has turned out to be a huge anxiety for the average Hyderabadi at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has already increased healthcare expenses manifold. Rising prices of LPG, petrol, and diesel have now spiked up prices of commodities such as red gram and edible oils. A comparison of prices for such items shows an increase from Rs 10 to Rs 50 from September 2020 to September 2021. “We have stopped having red gram and some brands of edible oil, simply because we cannot afford it anymore. Rising expenses and lower income in the pandemic is spelling doom for us,” said Swathy Aruna, a housewife and resident of Banjara hills. The price of red gram, an essential commodity for homes, has risen from Rs 97 per kilo to Rs 109 between September 2020 and September 2021. In the same period, the price of groundnut oil has risen from Rs 141 to Rs 159. Palm oil and sunflower oil prices have risen the most last year. The price of palm oil has risen to Rs 127, up from Rs 92 in September last year. Sunflower oil prices have risen by Rs 54, from Rs 100 in September 2020 to Rs 154 in September 2021. “Cooking oil and red gram prices are a major source of anxiety for the average middle-income household, especially because incomes are also down owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Life is becoming more expensive due to hikes in petrol and diesel rates. When will the prices stop rising?” questioned Sunkavalli Aruna, a private employee from Ashok Nagar. Activists claim that prices for essential commodities have risen as a result of recent revisions to the Essential Commodities Act. “Neither proposed changes in agriculture laws nor amendments implemented to the Essential Commodities Act are beneficial to farmers or consumers,” said Sujata S, an activist, added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/red-gram-oil-prices-give-heartburn-to-households/articleshow/87290557.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The training centre at a cost of Rs 61.8 crore under the Tamil Nadu Cooeprative Union was announced by EPS in 2020. “The DMK government should drop the idea to shift the location to Kodaikanal,” he said in a statement. He alleged that the DMK government was moving the centre to Kodaikanal out of political vendetta. According to EPS, the then AIADMK government considered several places across the state and finalised five acre poramboke land at Semmaduvu village in Manjakuttai panchayat in Yercaud. A detailed project report for a modern training centre building at a cost of Rs 39 crore was prepared in the first phase. Construction work had also begun, he said. “But, the registrar of cooperative department has written to PWD officials asking to stop the construction work on July 28. Subsequently, senior PWD officials have directed their subordinates to stop the work,” he said. EPS alleged that DMK government has been stalling several projects launched by AIADMK and has now taking steps to shift the cooperative training centre to Kodaikanal. “The government should restart construction in Yercaud,” he said warning that tribals in Yercaud, public in Salem and AIADMK cadres would stage protest if the government fails to abandon the plan to shift the centre to Kodaikanal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/dont-shift-training-centre-from-yercaud-eps-to-tn-govt/articleshow/87289652.cms||---
