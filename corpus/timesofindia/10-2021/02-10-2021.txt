"Taking our commitment to make Maharashtra the lead state in electric mobility in India, the state government and the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) have signed an MoU with Causis E-Mobility to set up an EV production unit in Talegaon. "The investment of Rs 2,800 cr will generate 1,250 employment opportunities," the state's Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray said in a statement. He added that the memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed with Causis E-Mobility Pvt Ltd, a joint venture (JV) of the UK-based Causis Group, is set to transform Maharashtra into a leading state in terms of the adoption of electric vehicles in the country. The state government had unveiled a comprehensive electrical vehicle policy in July 2021, to stimulate the manufacturing of battery electric vehicles in the state. The MoU for the phase-1 unit at Talegaon, Pune, was signed here on Friday. In phase-2, Causis E-Mobility Pvt Ltd will set up its own battery gigafactory in Maharashtra to manufacture and supply EV batteries. Under the Maharashtra EV Policy 2021, the state has drawn up a road map to bring in a transition in the transportation ecosystem of Maharashtra. It is aimed at attracting investments, facilitating the establishment of manufacturing units, and encouraging the production of EVs, their components, and EV supply equipment. Maharashtra's second capital Nagpur is the first Indian city to pilot electric mass mobility with a fleet of 200 electric vehicles. With the use of one electric car saving an average of 1.5 million grams of CO2, the equivalent of four return flights from Mumbai to Delhi, the Maharashtra EV Policy 2021 is also showing the way for cleaner streets making our towns and cities a better place to be for pedestrians and cyclists. To stimulate the manufacturing of electric vehicles in the state, the new EV policy provides elaborate incentives that are spread across three broad categories - supply side, demand side and special incentives for EV charging infrastructure. MIDC in a statement said that the MoU with Causis E-Mobility is to enhance EV vehicle manufacturing and strategise the transition towards the zero-emission target. The transition to an electric vehicle from a conventional fleet requires a planned strategy that not just overlooks the merging of the energy and transportation sector but also the relationship between consumers and vehicles. It will give a boost to the already-developed ecosystem in the state which plans to achieve a 25 per cent EV share in public transport in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik. It said the MoU facilitates a proposed investment of Rs 2,823 crore and direct employment of 1,250.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-bags-rs-2800-crore-investment-for-ev-manufacturing/articleshow/86691888.cms||---

Khan said the talks are taking place in Afghanistan and have been facilitated by the Afghan Taliban. “There are different groups which form the TTP and some of them want to talk to our government for peace. So, we are in talks with them. It’s a reconciliation process,” he said in an interview with the TRT World, a Turkish news channel. TTP is said to be regrouping in its former strongholds of North Waziristan and South Waziristan tribal districts. Pakistan had launched its final offensive against the TTP in North Waziristan in 2014 after a series of military operations that had started against the terror organisation in other tribal districts and the northwestern mountainous regions of Swat and Dir in 2009. When asked if his government was asking them to lay down arms, Khan responded: “Yes, we will forgive them if they become normal citizens.” Responding to a question why the TTP was conducting attacks on Pakistan’s security forces when they were in talks with the government, Khan said it was just a “spate of attacks”.

"Our leaders have asked all fighters to observe a ceasefire from today to OctoberJust a day ago, TTP had killed a captain of the Pakistani army during an intelligence-based operation in the Tank district, which is next to South Waziristan. “We might not reach some sort of conclusion or settlement in the end but we are talking,” Khan said. As the talks are taking place in Afghanistan, the Afghan Taliban were mediators in it, he added. Khan said that he didn’t believe in military solutions. “I stand for anti-military solution, and as a politician, I believe political dialogue is the way ahead.” He added that dialogue was the only way out in the case of Afghanistan also. In mid-September, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had expressed similar sentiments, saying the TTP should review its policies. “Our government would pardon them if they (TTP terrorists) promise not to get involved in terrorist activities and submit to the Pakistani Constitution,” Qureshi had said. Before the foreign minister, Pakistan’s president Arif Alvi had suggested that the government could consider giving an amnesty to those members of the TTP who are ready to disarm and agree to adhere to the Pakistani Constitution. Such an amnesty could be one of the ways to “establish peace”, the president had said. The TTP, however, had rejected Islamabad’s early amnesty offers and had linked their war on Pakistan with the imposition of Shariah or Islamic law in the country. “Pardon is usually offered to those who commit crimes, but we are quite proud of our struggle. We can offer conditional amnesty to our enemy if they promise to implement Shariah in the country,” the TTP had said in response to offers from Pakistan’s president and foreign minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-in-talks-with-ttp-reveals-imran-khan/articleshow/86691597.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday wrote to the chief ministers of the two states to create an enabling environment for Odia-speaking students there to study in their mother tongue, while the Odisha government requested the Jharkhand government to restore Odia as a language in the primary teachers’ training course. Underscoring the fact that the New Education Policy 2020 encourages states to teach students in their mother tongue for better cognitive development, Pradhan in the letter to Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, sought his “personal intervention in supporting and securing Odia language education in the state for its Odia-speaking population.” Jharkhand has an estimated 20 lakh Odia-speaking people mainly concentrated in the Kolhan division comprising Seraikela Kharsawan, East Singhbhum and West Singhbhum districts besides smaller population in Ranchi, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Simdega, Lahardega and Lathedar districts. While more than 300 Odia medium schools were opened in the region from 1913-1948, after the retirement of teachers posted in Odia-medium schools, the Jharkhand government seems to be appointing Hindi-speaking teachers there, the Union education minister wrote. “The state education department has started merging Odia medium schools with Hindi-medium ones. This step, citing few Odia- speaking students and staff as possible reasons, is clearly against the spirit of maintenance and promotion of linguistic diversity and rights of linguistic minorities as enshrined in our Constitution,” the Union minister wrote to the Jharkhand CM. Amid the recent protests in Jharkhand over poor patronage of Odia language, Odisha school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash wrote to his Jharkhand counterpart Jagannath Mahto to restore Odia in the primary teachers’ training course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/dharmendra-asks-jkhand-ap-cms-to-protect-promote-odia/articleshow/86699869.cms||Ashok Pradhan
---||World||Pakistan blames ‘lobbies, neighbours’ for US bill seeking sanctions||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan lashed out on Friday at its "neighbours and lobbies" for having a hand in the US bill tabled by Republican senators seeking sanctions against it for its alleged role in aiding the Taliban. Last Monday, the "Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act" was tabled in the US Senate by 22 Republican senators, demanding a deeper investigation into the Taliban victory in Afghanistan and sanctions on non-state and state actors, including the government of Pakistan, who had assisted them in ousting the Ashraf Ghani-led regime. "Pakistan will protect its interests and defend its position. The US has to understand the role played by Pakistan in facilitating the peace process," Qureshi said at a joint press conference with the visiting foreign minister of Denmark, Jeppe Kofod. "Scapegoating Pakistan would in fact mean overlooking the ground realities," he remarked. Qureshi said Pakistan would not ignore the implications of the bill on Pakistan, adding that "we are cognisant and can explain". He pointed out that the bill did not have a bipartisan understanding and was presented by a group of Republican senators who were even critical of some US policies and also against the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. "Let us not be excessively obsessed with the bill. There are lobbies in the US and our neighbours in the region who would like to play it up," he said. The Danish foreign minister reiterated that his country was not going to recognise the Taliban government as it was worried about Afghanistan becoming a "safe haven" for international terrorist groups. However, he added that Denmark will not "turn its back" on the Afghan people and will make efforts to ensure that the fundamental rights of 38 million Afghans are protected. The Danish envoy said that Denmark was "deeply worried" about the situation in Afghanistan. He said the Taliban government will not be judged on their words, but on "whether they respect rights of people or not".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-blames-lobbies-neighbours-for-us-bill-seeking-sanctions/articleshow/86692100.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

On October 1, 1967, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army attempted to intrude into the Sikkim side of the China-India border but due to the bravery of the Indian troops, the Chinese were forced to withdraw up to three kilometres beyond Cho La after sustaining significant casualties. India lost 21 brave hearts, while losses on the other side of the border were estimated to be 44 soldiers. The incident at Cho La was preceded by heavy fighting between the Indian and Chinese armies between September 11 and 14, 1967, over the construction of an iron fence by India in the Nathu La sector to prevent Chinese intrusions. The Cho La Skirmish in October 1967 was continuation of the Nathu La standoff. On Friday, a ceremony was held at the Trishakti War Memorial in Sukna where wreaths were laid to pay rich tributes to the brave soldiers of the Indian Army who laid down their lives on the icy heights of Cho La in the Sikkim sector from October 1 – 4 in the year 1967. “On this solemn occasion, a wreath was also laid at Cho La War Memorial, Sikkim and personnel of the Trishakti Corps paid homage to the valiant soldiers and remembered the tales of bravery of the Indian soldiers at Cho La and Nathu La that have become legends and are a source of constant motivation for one and all,” a statement issued by the army read. Based in Sukna, north Bengal near Siliguri, Trishakti Corps or XXXIII Corps is a corps of the Indian Army that draws some of its heritage from the British Indian XXXIII Corps which was formed in 1942, but disbanded in 1945. It was re-raised in 1960 at Shillong. The Corps’ area of responsibility includes North Bengal, Sikkim and if needed, Bhutan. It comprises three mountain divisions, 17th (Gangtok), 20th (Binnaguri), and 27th (Kalimpong).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/indian-army-pays-tribute-to-1967-war-heroes/articleshow/86692281.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

In another anti-terror operation, a joint team of security forces apprehended a LeT terrorist with a hand grenade and 29 rounds of 7.62mm calibre from Shopian’s Mujhmarg Junction later in the day. At least 113 terrorists (including infiltrators) have been killed in anti-terror operations across Kashmir Valley this year so far, said a police officer. As per officials, July has so far been the deadliest month during which 31 terrorists — most of them from LeT — alone were slain. Meanwhile, more than three months after J&K Police inspector Parvez Ahmad was gunned down by LeT terrorists, police on Friday claimed to have solved the case with the arrest of one of the accused, identified as Muheeb Bashir Dar from Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar. Around 5am, a joint team of Army’s 34RR, CRPF’s 178Bn and J&K Police launched a cordon-and-search operation in Rakhama village in Shopian’s Vehil hamlet, based on specific inputs about the presence of a terrorist. “We found that a local terrorist was hiding there. He was repeatedly asked to surrender but he opened fire at the search party instead, and was killed in retaliatory fire,” a police spokesman said. “The slain terrorist was identified as Mujeeb Lone from Redwani Bala in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district. Arms and ammunition including one pistol and a magazine were recovered from the spot,” said the spokesman. Later in the day, a joint team of the Army’s 1RR, CRPF’s 178Bn and Shopian Police set up a special checkpoint in Shopian’s Mujhmarg Junction based on intelligence inputs about terrorists’ movement and possible plans to attack security forces. During checking, a suspect — identified as Kamran Bashir Hajam of Babapora, an active LeT terrorist — was intercepted. He tried to flee but was overpowered by alert personnel who seized a grenade and ammunition from him. A case was registered against him. Meanwhile, giving case details of the cop’s murder, the IGP said inspector Ahmad, a resident of Nowgam, was on his way to pray at a mosque on June 22 when Muheeb, Ahmad’s neighbour, opened fire at the cop. Muheeb was accompanied by another LeT ultra, Basit Kamran, at the time of the crime, the IGP said. Besides Muheeb and Basit, two other LeT operatives — Saqib Manzoor and Rameez — were involved in the murder. Saqib and Rameez were recently slain in anti-terror operations in Sopore and Srinagar, while Basit is still on the run, said IGP Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/let-terrorist-killed-another-held-with-grenade-in-separate-shopian-ops/articleshow/86692192.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Bengaluru City University, which had earlier notified October 4 as the opening date for first-year UG courses, has said it now plans to reopen for freshers on October 21 and for second and final-year students from October 12. “Work is under way to finalise the syllabus and regulations as per the NEP. Many colleges also requested an extension as admissions are still happening. The students, who will not take engineering seats and those who have taken supplementary exams, will join now. Considering all this, we decided to postpone the reopening date,” said Lingraju Gandhi, BCU vice-chancellor. Bangalore University is expected to begin on October 18 for first-year students. “Our academic council is expected to meet on October 11. They will approve the syllabus and regulations and it will go to the government. We’ll have a principals’ meet on October 4 and then on12. By October18, hopefully, we’ll start our classes for the first years,” said KR Venugopal, VC. Bengaluru North University interim vice-chancellor Kumuda D said the reopening date for first semesters will be on October 21. It was supposed to reopen on October 1. For other semesters, it will start from October 12. It was announced earlier that all universities will start classes by October first week with NEP in place. However, it has been a tight race for them as the model syllabus from the Karnataka State Higher Education Council was ready only two weeks ago. The universities have to modify the syllabus according to their needs through BoS. They have to get the syllabus and regulations approved from the academic council and the government before implementing them. Some autonomous colleges like NMKRV College for Women will start on October 1. Classes in Mount Carmel College will start next week and Nrupathunga University on October 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1st-yr-ug-opening-delayed-as-nep-rules-in-the-works/articleshow/86692489.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Nagaraju Y, a resident of Chudasandra, near Bellandur and employee of a private firm, told police that he met the miscreant near a petrol bunk a few months ago when he was on his way to work. “The miscreant wore a police uniform and stopped my bike at least thrice and checked their documents.

On April 19, Nagaraju met Harish at Haraluru and expressed his intention to purchase a used car. “Harish promised me he would arrange a seized car for a lower price and said he would give me a MUV for Rs 80,000. I gave him the money and went to the police quarters to take the car as he had instructed. I found no car near the quarters and Harish went incommunicado.

Announced just ahead of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s visit to Sri Lanka, the agreement for the Western Container Terminal (WCT), even though it doesn’t involve the Indian government, allows an Indian company presence at the strategically important port where China is funding several megaprojects. Read AlsoForeign secretary Shringla begins 4-day visit to Sri LankaForeign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Saturday began his four-day visit to Sri Lanka during which he will meet the top leadership, including President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, and review the bilateral ties between India and the island nation. Shringla arrivedShringla will seek to re-engage Sri Lanka at the political level during his 4-day trip which will also see him visiting Jaffna, Trincomalee and Kandy. ``The visit of foreign secretary will provide an opportunity to review our bilateral ties, progress of ongoing bilateral projects and ongoing cooperation to tackle Covid related disruptions,’’ said the government in a statement. Shringla is expected to call on both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa during the visit. While the international media has described the WCT agreement as India’s move to counter growing Chinese influence, official sources here said India still looks at Sri Lanka’s unilateral decision to walk out of the international agreement for the ECT as very unfortunate.

While India is not averse to China’s economic activities, it wants Sri Lanka to deal in a similar manner with India-funded projects in areas like ports and energy. The Trincomalee oil farm project is seen as an example of the lack of progress that’s of concern to India. India also wants Sri Lanka to be mindful of India’s security interests while dealing with China. A 1987 bilateral agreement also requires that no Lankan port be made available for military use by any country in a manner ``prejudicial to India’s interests’’. Sri Lanka will allow the Adani group, and a local conglomerate, 85 per cent stake in WCT while the ECT proposal entailed only 49 per cent stake for India and Japan. A government source said the agreement announced this week for WCT was a ``useful development’’ as it was important for India to be present at the Colombo port and that it was fine even if it was in the form of an Indian company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-china-looms-india-looks-to-refresh-ties-with-sri-lanka/articleshow/86692499.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||World||Kentucky governor files paperwork for reelection run in 2023||FRANKFORT: Fresh off landing a record-shattering economic development deal with Ford Motor Company that put Kentucky at the forefront of the green energy movement, Democratic governor Andy Beshear on Friday launched a reelection run that will be tied to his aggressive actions to combat the Covid-19 in his rapidly reddening state.  Still two years away from voters delivering a verdict on his pandemic-plagued term, Beshear filed paperwork allowing him to raise and spend money on his 2023 reelection bid. The 43-year-old governor faces a bruising campaign in a state dominated by Republicans eager to rip into his coronavirus-related restrictions during much of the pandemic.  In a social media post, the governor said: "There are so many challenges facing our Commonwealth. Kentuckians are counting on me to deliver, and I won't let them down."  Eric Hyers, the governor's 2019 campaign manager and adviser to his reelection effort, called Beshear a "game-changing" governor and said the filing was "the first step in a long campaign."  "He's going to be a two-term governor because Kentuckians know he has the guts to make the tough calls, and he always puts the people of the commonwealth ahead of his own political interests," Hyers said.  Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman will be Beshear's running mate again in 2023, Hyers said.  Beshear, a former state attorney general and the son of former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, a baggage-laden incumbent, in 2019. He faces another formidable challenge and now has his own record to defend.  Several Republicans are weighing bids to unseat Beshear in 2023. They include former United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft, Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Sen. Max Wise and state Rep. Savannah Maddox. State Auditor Mike Harmon already announced he's in the race.  Beshear maintained a high profile during the pandemic with his frequent news conferences. But he's tried to turn the corner from the public health crisis to focus on Kentucky's economic rebound, which got the kind of dramatic jolt this week that governors dream about.  On Monday, Ford announced it will build twin battery plants at Glendale, Kentucky, in a joint venture with its battery partner, SK Innovation of South Korea, to help power the automaker's next generation of electric vehicles. The $5.8 billion Kentucky project, paired with another massive project in neighboring Tennessee, will create 5,000 jobs in the Bluegrass State, along with the potential for many more from suppliers. It's Kentucky's single largest-ever economic development project.  Beshear basked in the legacy-building announcement at a Tuesday celebration, where Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford declared: "It's really because of the leadership of the governor that we're here today."  But Beshear has faced withering criticism from Republicans for his past actions to combat the pandemic, from his mask mandates to strict capacity restrictions on businesses to try to curb the virus's spread. The GOP-led legislature responded by limiting the governor's emergency powers, which he used to impose the restrictions. Republicans also blamed him for the long waits tens of thousands of Kentuckians endured in seeking unemployment aid.  State Republican Chairman Mac Brown said Friday that Beshear has a clear record of "executive overreach" and mismanagement of unemployment insurance, adding that "Kentuckians deserve a better way than what the Beshear administration has to offer."  Beshear says his pandemic actions saved lives and for months Kentucky's numbers supported that claim in comparison to nearby states that took a less aggressive approach. He acknowledged the unemployment insurance fiasco but said budget and staffing cuts hobbled the unemployment insurance system long before he took office.  The coronavirus has claimed the lives of at least 8,770 Kentuckians.  Scott Jennings, a Kentuckian and former adviser to Republican President George W. Bush, sees the still-distant race as a toss-up and said Republicans should not underestimate the governor.  "Beshear is not going to be a pushover to beat," Jennings said. "I think there are some Republicans who think this is a foregone conclusion because of how Republican the state is, but it will be a tough race. ... The Beshears are good at holding on to political offices."  Beshear's pandemic record will provide fodder for Republicans, but the election "is a long way away and it is hard to know how top of mind it will be for voters at the time," he said.  "If the GOP can nominate someone even slightly less detestable than Matt Bevin, the party has more than a fighting chance of unseating the incumbent," Jennings said.  The combative Bevin was weakened politically by a series of self-inflicted wounds, highlighted by a feud with teachers who opposed his efforts to revamp the state's woefully underfunded public pension systems. Despite his missteps, he only lost by a few thousand votes.  Democrat Mike Ward, who formerly served in Congress and Kentucky's legislature, predicted Beshear's handling of the pandemic, plus the Ford announcement, will put him in a strong position.

Tarigami said that the claims made in the MHA report titled “The dream of one nation, one law, one symbol fulfilled: After effective removal of the provisions of Article 370, the picture has changed: a new start in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh” are far from the reality. “The reality is that there is a systematic disempowerment of the people of J&K that is continuing to happen, through bureaucratic rule,” he maintained. The spokesperson pointed out that the projects mentioned in the government booklet were mostly approved by previous governments but are shown to have been the outcome of the abrogation of Article 370. “Reality is that Nashri Tunnel, Zojilla Tunnel, establishment of 50 degree colleges and various medical colleges are projects approved much before the abrogation of Article 370,” he contended. “The BJP government is boasting of implementation of various laws, like Land Reforms and RTI Act which is claimed to have been effective now. This is a blatant lie as the state of Jammu and Kashmir was a pioneer in implementing the revolutionary land reforms laws which no other state has done except Kerala to some extent.” Tarigami alleged that unemployment has increased manifold compared to pre-August 2019 period. “The filling up of vacancies is a routine exercise which was being done earlier also and now attributing it to the post abrogation era is beyond our comprehension,” he added. Tarigami maintained that the removal of special status and restrictions on land purchase by outsiders will not add an iota of employment while on the contrary, it will most likely cause a reduction in employment in the region as land passes into the hands of rich outsiders from Delhi or Mumbai. He recalled that unemployment rate is the highest in India in the last 45 year and in J&K it is worse than that. “This government being the product of a Hindutva-corporate alliance, almost everything it does also caters to a pro-corporate agenda, apart from promoting Hindutva. Opening up the Kashmir valley to its corporate patrons, not so much for expanding the volume of productive economic activities but for land acquisition for real estate development or for sheer speculation on land price, is also an added incentive,” he said.

The shooting happened about 11:45 am at YES Prep Southwest Secondary, a charter school that serves students in sixth through 12th grades. Houston police chief Troy Finner said the man shot through the school's door, then shot at the employee in the back.  The employee was in serious condition at a hospital, Finner said.  No students were hurt, the school said in a statement.  Police did not release the name of the wounded employee or the shooter but said they were able to quickly identify him because he was a former student.  A line of students in masks streamed out of the school just before 1 pm, holding their hands up to show officers they were not carrying a weapon. Multiple students told reporters that they saw blood while leaving the building.  "You don't want anything like this to happen," Finner said, "but I want to commend those students. Every student I've seen coming out, they were calm. The administrators, the teachers, outstanding job. I want to commend them ... they train for it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/houston-school-employee-shot-at-by-former-student-police-say/articleshow/86692835.cms||---

The ministry of social justice and empowerment will act as the facilitator in the entire process to help the elderly with identified start-ups. The selected start-ups will be hosted on the MSJ&E’s SAGE portal and the ministry will be providing a fund of Rs 1 crore as one-time equity to each of them. In the next five years, the government plans to fund 100 innovative start-ups. One of the selected start-ups, Neomotion, has come up with a “no transfer” accessibility solution where a user will be able to attach the wheelchair to a motorbike and travel. Newnara’s “Indoknee” offers lightweight, unhindered corrective support, Flexmo a wearable hip guard and Ducere smart insoles for fall prevention. Another start-up, Avyantra, is working to deliver an automated medical device for home dialysis. Once the requisite approvals for using the technology come, this could make life easier for those struggling with chronic kidney failure. “Life Circle” offers subscription-based Home Healthcare Services for the elderly. There is Mediyatra that seeks to make travel more accessible for the elderly patients and people with disabilities and Primate Healthtech that is focussed on accessible diagnostics for early detection of chronic diseases. For the travel loving elderly, there is KareVoyage. Asserting the important role of start-ups at the Vayoshreshtha Samman on the International Day of Older Persons, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu urged these companies to come up with innovative and out-of-box solutions to the everyday problems faced by the elderly. He highlighted that India has become the world’s third-largest start-up ecosystem. Naidu also launched the e-employment exchange - (Senior Able Citizens for Re-Employment in Dignity) for elderly. He said he would prefer to refer tol senior citizens as ‘elders’ rather than ‘older persons’. In the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic, he said efforts must be made to increase digital literacy among senior citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/startups-step-in-for-elderly-with-smart-solutions-for-accessible-healthcare-and-travel/articleshow/86693006.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||World||Biden at Capitol as Democrats scale back $3.5T plan||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden travelled to Capitol Hill Friday to meet with lawmakers on their home ground as Democrats strained to rescue a scaled-back version of his $3.5 trillion government overhaul and salvage a related public works bill after days of frantic negotiations resulted in no deal. Biden was greeted by party leaders and headed straight into a private meeting with House Democrats. The White House said he also would be visiting other cities next week to make his case that his historic measures would help the American people. “We've made some progress,” said press secretary Jen Psaki. “Compromise requires everybody giving a little. That’s the stage we’re in.” However, action had ground to a halt in Congress despite Speaker Nancy Pelosi's insistence there would be a “vote today” on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that is popular but has become snared in the debate over Biden's broader measure. Voting on Friday appeared increasingly unlikely, throwing the president's big domestic agenda into doubt as negotiations dragged. Holdout Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia had sunk hopes for a swift compromise, despite hours of shuttle diplomacy late Thursday with White House aides on Capitol Hill, when he refused to budge on his demands for a smaller overall package, around $1.5 trillion. That's too meager for progressive lawmakers who are refusing to vote on the public works measure without a commitment to Biden's broader framework on the bigger bill. Talks swirled over a compromise in the $2 trillion range. But with Manchin dug in, a quick deal seemed increasingly out of reach for the present. Still, Biden's visit was welcomed by Democrats who have complained about not hearing enough from the president about a path forward. “It’s his time to stand up,” said Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota. Because of the ongoing negotiations, Biden opted to remain in Washington on Friday instead of traveling to his Delaware home as he often does on weekends. His public approval rating has dropped, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center. The president and his party are facing a potentially embarrassing setback — and perhaps a politically devastating collapse of the whole enterprise — if they cannot resolve the standoff. Biden's bigger proposal is a years-in-the-making collection of Democratic priorities, a sweeping rewrite of the nation's tax and spending policies that would essentially raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy and plow that money back into government health care, education and other programs, touching the lives of countless Americans. Biden says the ultimate price tag is zero, because the tax revenue would cover the spending costs — higher rates on businesses earning more than $5 million a year, and individuals earning more than $400,000 a year, or $450,000 for couples. “We understand that we’re going to have to get everybody on board in order to be able to close this deal,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “We’re waiting for that.” Frustrated and with their trust frayed, centrist Democrats watched the promised vote slip on the first piece of Biden’s proposal, the slimmer $1 trillion public works bill, a roads-and-bridges package, as progressives flexed their leverage. During a private caucus meeting earlier Friday, Pelosi asked lawmakers to stand if they supported the infrastructure package, and most did, according to those in the room. But Pelosi has few votes to spare and appeared inclined not to risk failure. Instead, the House and Senate were poised to swiftly approve a 30-day extension of surface transportation programs that are expiring with the fiscal yearend, halting furloughing of more than 3,500 federal transportation workers. That also creates a new deadline to act on the stalled $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The White House and Democratic leaders are intently focused on Manchin and to some extent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, two centrist Democrats who helped steer the public works bill to Senate passage but have concerns that Biden’s overall bill is too big. The two senators have infuriated colleagues with their close-to-the vest negotiations that could tank Biden's effort — and their own campaign promises. "I’m willing to sit down and work on the $1.5,” Manchin told reporters Thursday, as protesters seeking a bigger package and Biden’s priorities chanted behind him outside the Capitol. After hours of negotiations that stretched near midnight Thursday, Manchin said he could not yet compromise. “I don’t see a deal tonight. I really don’t,” Manchin told reporters as he left. The political stakes could hardly be higher. Biden and his party are reaching for a giant legislative accomplishment — promising to deliver vision, dental and hearing care for seniors, free kindergarten for youngsters, strategies to tackle climate change and more — with a slim majority in Congress. Pushing the package is testing not just Biden, but Pelosi and some of the leading figures in the Democratic Party whose legacies will be shaped by weather they succeed or fail. “We’ve been fighting for transformative legislation as all of you know; these discussions have gone on for month after month after month,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the chairman of the Budget Committee and a leading progressive lawmaker. “This is not a baseball game. This is the most significant piece of legislation in 70 years." With Republicans all opposed to the president’s big plan, deriding it as slide to socialist-style spending, Biden is reaching for a deal with members of his own party for a signature policy achievement. It's not just Manchin's demands to reduce the overall size, but the conditions he is insisting on that are riling his more liberal colleagues. For example, he wants to ensure the aid goes only to lower-income people, rather than broader swaths of Americans. And he's resisting some of the bolder efforts to tackle climate change. Tensions spiked late Wednesday when Manchin sent out a fiery statement, decrying the broad spending as “fiscal insanity.” Democrats’ campaign promises on the line, progressive lawmakers were fuming, sparks flying at the holdout senators. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., another progressive leader, pointing her criticism clear at Manchin's remarks. “Trying to kill your party’s agenda is insanity,” she said.

A bench headed by CJI N V Ramana said, “I have a lot of reservations about the way in this country bureaucrats, particularly police officers, are behaving. At one time, I was thinking of creating a standing committee headed by the chief justice of the high courts to examine atrocities of bureaucrats and police officers and complaints made against them. But I do not want to do it now. The matter will come again.” These remarks from the CJI came in a case where additional director general of police in Chhattisgarh Gurjinder Pal Singh has sought protection from arrest from state police in three cases, including sedition and disproportionate assets. He alleged that he was called late in the night to CM Bhupesh Baghel’s residence and was pressured to implicate former CM Raman Singh in the PDS scam. “When he refused to abide by the illegal order, he was implicated in case after case,” said senior advocates Fali S Nariman and Vikas Singh. Appearing for the state, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said documents seized from outside the senior police officer’s residence clearly indicated that he was attempting to spread disharmony among different communities and fuel agitation in the state for toppling the Baghel-led Congress government. “This is a clear case of rebellion and sedition,” he said. In the same case, the bench of CJI Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli had earlier made scathing remarks against the infectious tendency among certain police officers to cosy up to regimes and later, when the regime changed, face music. “It is a disturbing feature across the country. To be in the good books of politicians in power, they commit ‘harakiri’. First, they register cases against political opponents at the beck and call of those at the helm of power. They face the music at the hands of other police officers when the previously targeted politicians come to power,” it had said, adding, “The police officers have to apportion blame among themselves for this sorry state of affairs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-time-to-put-the-lens-on-atrocities-by-babus-cops/articleshow/86693338.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Fashion exec Peter Nygard to be extradited to US, will face sex crimes charges||MONTREAL: Fashion executive Peter Nygard agreed in a Canadian court on Friday to be extradited to the United States where he faces charges of raping dozens of women and girls, racketeering and trafficking.  Held in prison since his arrest in Winnipeg, Manitoba last December, the 80-year-old Finnish-Canadian millionaire made a brief court appearance via video link. Scott Farlinger, a lawyer representing the Canadian government in the case, explained that Nygard, who'd been denied bail on the grounds he might tamper with witnesses or his accusers, had opted not to fight the extradition.  "This process can now move forward in order for him to face trial in the United States," defense lawyer Brian Greenspan confirmed.  That, he said will provide Nygard "the opportunity to raise his defense and to challenge the truthfulness of the evidence which has been brought against him."  Canada's attorney general must still approve the extradition.  Nygard faces nine charges in the United States involving dozens of victims -- women and girls from disadvantaged economic backgrounds or who had histories of abuse whom he groomed and lured to his luxury estates on the pretense of lucrative modelling opportunities.  His alleged crimes, according to the US indictment, took place between 1990 and 2020. Nygard and his accomplices, including employees of his group, "used force, fraud, and coercion to cause women and minors to have sex" with them, it said.  The perma-tanned Nygard, known for his long, flowing gray hair and flamboyant dress sense, has denied the allegations.  Also Friday, Toronto police announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for Nygard for six alleged sexual assaults, some involving forcible confinement, between 1987 and 2006. His case has drawn parallels with that of late financier Jeffrey Epstein who was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he killed himself in a New York jail in 2019.  According to Lisa Haba, a lawyer representing women suing Nygard in a class action, "Nygard is worse than Epstein".  "We believe he had more victims," she told AFP. "And he was more violent in the crimes he committed", including "incredibly violent rapes (and) forcing victims to defecate on him".  His victims, she added, have suffered "lifelong and all-consuming" pain.  Nygard, the founder of women's clothing company Nygard International, was reported to be worth over $850 million (US$ 670 million) in 2015, according to Canadian Business magazine.  He has long boasted about his rise from humble beginnings, as a young immigrant who built a fashion empire with nearly 170 stores at its peak.  His company, however, filed for bankruptcy shortly after the FBI and police raided Nygard's Manhattan corporate headquarters last year.  Several women have joined the class action launched in February 2020, accusing him of having assaulted, raped and sodomized them at his seaside mansion on New Providence island, some of them when they were young teens.  According to court documents, company funds were said to have been used to host dinner parties, poker games and so-called "pamper parties" where minor girls were drugged and women assaulted if they did not comply with his sexual demands.  Partygoers were often photographed and their personal information including weight and physical measurements kept in a registry.  Nygard also paid from corporate accounts for victims' travel, living expenses, plastic surgery, abortions and child support, said prosecutors.  A behind-the-scenes video shot by a whistleblower who'd spent three years documenting Nygard showed him flirting with a 16-year-old girl at the 2012 London Olympics, and a 17-year-old dancing on a stripper pole on Nygard's private Boeing 727 plane.  "Nygard would just come down and choose a girl. Usually they would be drunk," Stephen Feralio, who'd been hired as Nygard's personal videographer, told public broadcaster CBC.  "If I don't expose him, he's going to get away with all the things that he's been doing," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/fashion-exec-agrees-to-extradition-to-face-us-sex-crimes-charges/articleshow/86693481.cms||---

The sixth revision in eight days pushed diesel price beyond Rs 100 per litre in five states and petrol price to an all-time high across the country. In Delhi, which has comparatively lower VAT rates, petrol hit its highest-ever at Rs 101.89 a litre and Rs 107.95 in Mumbai. Diesel price rose to a record Rs 90.17 in Delhi and Rs 97.84 in Mumbai. It shot past Rs 100 in several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Prices vary in states due to different VAT rates and freight charges. Fuel prices are moving up when assembly polls are round the corner in UP, a politically important state for BJP. This has stoked fears among oil company managements that the oil ministry may informally ask them to hold the price line as in the past, leading to under-recovery. Prices had remained stagnant for 67 days since July 17 as retailers held back daily revisions, even though crude headed north with a few brief lulls in August. Between May 4 and July 17, petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre and diesel by Rs 9.14. While retail rates were not raised to reflect higher crude prices, they were promptly reduced the few times oil slipped. Between August 18 and September 5, petrol price was cut four times and diesel’s seven times, making petrol cheaper by 65 paise and diesel by Rs 1.25 in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/petrol-diesel-prices-hit-record-high/articleshow/86693584.cms||---

Mizoram’s positivity rate is even higher at 17%, followed by Sikkim, Manipur and Meghalaya, each ranging between 5% and 8%. A lockdown, or at least strict imposition of containment zones, might be the need of the hour in the five states. A fortnightly positivity rate study shows all-India rates going below 2% in the last fortnight (Sept 16-29). Bihar, UP, Delhi, Haryana and Gujarat are among the states who seem to have the infection currently in check with the total confirmed cases per 100 tests climbing down to as low as 0.006%. A high positivity rate is indicative of the fact that a state might be testing only the sickest and need more tracking and treatment of a larger infected population. Though the fatality rates may have been lower this time compared to the peak of the second wave in April-May, any new variant carries the risk of more casualties. Coronavirus live updatesGoa, Karnataka, West Bengal, Uttarakhand and half a dozen other states had clocked a positivity rate of up to 42% in the first fortnight of May. Goa had highest at 42%, Karnataka and West Bengal at 31% and 30% respectively. Kerala then had it at 27%. Each of the other states have since contained the outbreak to below 1% level, except Kerala and some north eastern states. Goa though is seeing an uptick, rising from 0.07% during September 3-16 fortnight to 1.8% in the last fortnight.

Five others currently have active cases ranging between 1,000 and 7,000.

India logged 23,910 fresh cases on Thursday. While infections continue to decline overall in the country, there are significant day-to-day variations mainly following the pattern in Kerala, which has been accounting for a bulk of fresh cases. Kerala on Friday reported 13,834 new Covid cases, a sharp drop from the previous day when the count had spiked to 15,914. The day’s test positivity rate too declined to 13.12%, CM Pinarayi Vijayan said. Besides Kerala, the count of new cases fell in Mizoram (1,170, from 1,741 on Thursday), Karnataka (589, from 933) Andhra Pradesh (809, from 933) and Odisha (477, from 602). While the drop in Tamil Nadu was marginal — 1,597, from 1,612 on Thursday — this was the first time in 17 days that the state has recorded less than 1,600 daily cases. Maharashtra’s tally of 3,105 fresh cases remained about the same as the number reported on Thursday (3,063).

Three daughters of a Himachal Pradesh couple requested a trial court, where their brother had filed a suit for a declaration that he was the sole inheritor of their parents’ properties, to subject their ‘brother’ to DNA test while claiming that he was not the biological son of their parents, which disentitled him from inheriting their parents property. The man refused to undergo a DNA test. The trial court dismissed the application saying he can’t be forced to undergo the blood test. But, the HC reversed the decision and asked the man to take a DNA test. On appeal, a bench of Justices R S Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy said, “In a case like the present, the court’s decision should be rendered only after balancing the interests of the parties, that is, the quest for truth, and the social and cultural implications involved therein. The possibility of stigmatising a person as a bastard, the ignominy that attaches to an adult who, in the mature years of his life is shown to be not the biological son of his parents may not only be a heavy cross to bear but would also intrude upon his right of privacy”. Referring to the nine-judge bench decision in K S Puttaswamy case that had given right to dprivacy the status of a fundamental right being part of right to life, the bench said, “When the plaintiff is unwilling to subject himself to the DNA test, forcing him to undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty and his right to privacy”. Writing the judgment, Justice Roy said DNA is unique to an individual (barring twins) and can be used to identify a person’s identity, trace familial linkages or even reveal sensitive health information. “Whether a person can be compelled to provide a DNA sample can also be answered considering the test of proportionality laid down in the unanimous decision of this court in K S Puttaswamy case, wherein the right to privacy has been declared a constitutionally protected right,” he said. Referring to the dispute in hand, the bench said, “In such a kind of litigation, where the interest will have to be balanced and the test of eminent need is not satisfied, our considered opinion is that the protection of the right to privacy of the plaintiff should take precedence." The SC said the plaintiff, without subjecting himself to a DNA test, is entitled to establish his right over the property in question, through other material evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-force-paternity-test-in-inheritance-tussle-says-sc/articleshow/86694148.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

From Saturday, CNG will cost Rs 47.48 per kg in Delhi and Rs 53.45 per kg in National Capital Region’s Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. It will cost Rs 55.81 per kg in Gurugram, Rs 56.50 in Rewari, Rs 54.70 in Karnal and Kaithal, Rs 60.71 in Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Shamli, Rs 63.97 in Kanpur, Fatehpur and Hamirpur and Rs 62.41 in Ajmer. The increase in the CNG prices may evoke demand for higher tariffs from bus, taxi and autorickshaw operators. But IGL said the per-km impact on the running cost of the vehicles will be negligible and that the CNG would still offer more than 60 per cent savings against petrol and diesel at their current prices.  It added for autos, the increase would be 6 paise per km, for taxis, it would be 11 paise per km and in case of buses, the rise would be Rs 1.65 per km.  The PNG to the households in Delhi will cost Rs 33.01 per unit, up from Rs. 30.91. In Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, the PNG will cost Rs 32.86 per unit for households. In Rewari and Karnal, the new rate will be Rs 31.81 per unit, while in Gurugram it will be Rs 31.20. In Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Shamli, the PNG will cost Rs 36.37 per unit.  The IGL said the upward revision will offset the impact of increase in the price of natural gas only marginally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/day-after-natural-gas-price-rise-igl-raises-cng-png-costs-highest-since-2012/articleshow/86693998.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||World||Biden administration urges judge to block Texas abortion law||AUSTIN: The Biden administration on Friday urged a federal judge to block the nation's most restrictive abortion law, which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September and sent women racing to get care beyond the borders of the second-most populous state.  United States district judge Robert Pitman, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, did not say when he would rule following a nearly three-hour hearing in Austin. At least one Texas abortion provider said it stood ready to resume offering services at its three clinics if the law known as Senate Bill 8 is temporarily shelved.  "Every day that S.B. 8 is in effect, we turn away patients in droves," Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman's Health, told the court in a filing.  So far, abortion providers trying to block the Texas law have been rejected at every turn. That makes a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration their best chance yet to deliver the first legal blow to the GOP-engineered law. It has withstood an early wave of challenges, including one reviewed by the US Supreme Court, which allowed the law to remain in force.  The law bans abortion in Texas once cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around six weeks, before some women know they are pregnant. No exceptions are made in cases of rape or incest. Enforcement is solely left up to private citizens who are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages if they are successful in suing not just abortion providers but anyone found to have helped a woman get an abortion.  "A state may not ban abortions at six weeks. Texas knew this, but it wanted a six-week ban anyway, so the state resorted to an unprecedented scheme of vigilante justice that was designed to scare abortion providers and others who might help women exercise their constitutional rights," Justice Department attorney Brian Netter told the court.  The law was signed by Republican governor Greg Abbott in May and took effect September 1.  In that short time, abortion providers say, "exactly what we feared" has become reality. Planned Parenthood says the number of patients from Texas at its state clinics decreased nearly 80 per cent in the two weeks after the law took effect. Some providers have described Texas clinics that are now in danger of closing while neighbouring states struggle to keep up with a surge of patients who must drive hundreds of miles. Other women, they say, are being forced to carry pregnancies to term.  "This is not some kind of vigilante scheme," said Will Thompson, defending the law for the Texas attorney general's Office. "This is a scheme that uses the normal, lawful process of justice in Texas."  If the Justice Department prevails, Texas officials would likely seek a swift reversal from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which previously allowed the restrictions to take effect.  In anticipation of Pitman possibly granting an injunction, physicians at Whole Woman's Health clinics this week gave patients found to have cardiac activity information to comply with another restriction requiring a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, so that they would be ready to call those patients back in, Hagstrom Miller told the court.  Hope of an injunction, she said, "is one of the only things that is keeping us going day to day".  The Texas law is just one that has set up the biggest test of abortion rights in the US in decades, and it is part of a broader push by Republicans nationwide to impose new restrictions on abortion.  On Monday, the US Supreme Court begins a new term, which in December will include arguments in Mississippi's bid to overturn 1973's landmark Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing a woman's right to an abortion.  Last month, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Texas law in allowing it to remain in place. But abortion providers took that 5-4 vote as an ominous sign about where the court might be heading on abortion after its conservative majority was fortified with three appointees of former president Donald Trump.  Ahead of the new Supreme Court term, Planned Parenthood on Friday released a report saying that if Roe v. Wade were overturned, 26 states are primed to ban abortion. This year alone, nearly 600 abortion restrictions have been introduced in statehouses nationwide, with more than 90 becoming law, according to Planned Parenthood.  Other states, mostly in the South, have passed similar laws that ban abortion within the early weeks of pregnancy, all of which judges have blocked. But Texas' version has so far outmaneuvered courts because it leaves enforcement to private citizens, not prosecutors, which critics say amounts to a bounty.  Texas officials argued in court filings this week that even if the law were put on hold temporarily, providers could still face the threat of litigation over violations that might occur in the time between a permanent ruling.  "The federal government's complaint is that the Heartbeat Act is difficult to effectively enjoin," the state wrote in objection to the lawsuit by the Biden administration. "But there is no requirement that a state write its laws to make them easily enjoined."  At least one Texas abortion provider has admitted to violating the law and been sued - but not by abortion opponents. Former attorneys in Illinois and Arkansas say they instead sued a San Antonio doctor in hopes of getting a judge who would invalidate the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-administration-urges-judge-to-block-texas-abortion-law/articleshow/86694608.cms||---

It asked the petitioner about the justification of continuing protests by blocking highways that have strangulated the capital city when the oufit had already challenged the laws in the court. Jaipur-based Kisan Mahapanchayat, through advocate Ajay Choudhary, told a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar that the organisation was one of the petitioners who have challenged the validity of the laws, implementation of which was stayed for a year and half by the apex court in January to bring the farmers to the negotiating table. Chaudhary said the Delhi Police repeatedly rejected permission to the Mahapanchayat to hold protests with 200 members/protesters at Jantar Mantar despite easing of Covid norms. “You have strangulated the entire city by blocking the highways at crucial entry points from various states. Now you want to come inside the city to protest,” the justices said. “The issue is already challenged before the Supreme Court. Once you have made up your mind to come to the court, you cannot go on protesting on the streets. Are you protesting against the judicial system?” Citizens have a right to move freely. Have you thought about their rights getting violated because of road blockade? Are the residents around the protest points happy with the farmers blocking the highways? Their business has stopped. You (farmers) even obstructed movement of vehicles carrying defence personnel and heckled them as per newspaper reports. You block train movement. You block highways and then come and say the protests are peaceful,” the bench said. When Chaudhary said the highways are blocked by police and not farmers, the bench asked Kisan Mahapanchayat, which moved the court through its president Ram Pal Jat, to file an affidavit declaring that the petitioner is not part of the road blockade protests being organised by various farmer organisations at three border points on highways linking Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Justices Khanwilkar and Ravikumar said, “You (Kisan Mahapanchayat) cannot isolate yourself from the ongoing protests. You cannot protest when you have already moved the Supreme Court. If you want to continue with your protests, don't come to court.” While posting the petition for hearing on October 8, the bench asked the organisation to file an affidavit clarifying whether it is participating in the ongoing protests by farmers. It also asked Chaudhary to serve the petition on Attorney General K K Venugopal. On Thursday, another bench headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul had told the government that the law on the issue (protesters blocking public roads) has been settled in the Shaheen Bagh case and that it was for the Executive to implement it. In the Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA protest case, the SC had said that no protester can be permitted to block public pathways or highways indefinitely in violation of the right of citizens to move freely. The SC had on October 7, 2020 ruled that "we have no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions". "While appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest against a legislation, we have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone. The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area, but was blockade of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters. We cannot accept the plea of the applicants that an indeterminable number of people can assemble whenever they choose to protest," it had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-be-in-court-also-go-on-blocking-roads-sc-to-farmers/articleshow/86694684.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Chandigarh||Harish Rawat mocks Captain’s ‘humiliation’ theory, former Punjab CM hits back||CHANDIGARH/DEHRADUN: A day after Amarinder Singh announced that he would quit Congress, the former CM came under a no-holds-barred attack on Friday from AICC’s Punjab minder Harish Rawat who alleged that Captain had circulated the theory about “humiliation” by the Congress leadership to gain sympathy. On Amarinder’s meeting with home minister Amit Shah, Rawat said it “raises a question mark over his secular credentials”. “Amarinder’s ideology does not align with that of BJP leaders and I believe they are simply using him as a mukhauta (mask),” Rawat said. Amarinder hit back at Rawat’s “outrageous claims and allegations”, which he said were clearly prompted by the “pathetic” situation the party now found itself in Punjab after being on a winning spree for four and a half years. “Three weeks before stepping down as CM, I had offered my resignation to Sonia Gandhi but she had asked me to continue,” said Amarinder, adding the humiliating manner in which he was pushed into resigning just hours before the CLP meeting, that was clearly convened to oust him, was a matter of public record. “The world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet Rawat is making claims to the contrary,” he said, adding, “If this was not humiliation then what was it?” Addressing mediapersons in Dehradun, Rawat said it appeared that Amarinder’s recent remarks were “made under some sort of pressure and he should rethink and not help BJP either directly or indirectly”. Later, Rawat said in a press statement, “There was a general perception that Amarinder and Badals are helping each other with a secret understanding. I was always politely suggesting to him to initiate action on our election promises. At least five times I discussed these issues with Captain Saab but to no avail.” Rawat said during Amarinder’s tenure, there were heated discussions in cabinet meetings on the Bargari sacrilege and later, many prominent ministers came to Delhi with a complaint that Congress can’t win the Punjab elections with him as CM. He said as a solution, the Congress high command formed a three-member panel, which heard more than 150 prominent leaders from Punjab. “In this meeting, the overwhelming majority of Congress MLAs had very clearly expressed their dissatisfaction with Amarinder administration’s style of functioning,” Rawat said. After prolonged discussions, Amarinder agreed to implement 18 points, which were suggested by the panel to the Congress president. However, Amarinder did not implement even one out of these 18 points, Rawat alleged. “Born out of his stubbornness, he was of the belief that he did not need any advice from anyone, including his own MLAs, ministers and party leadership. However, again I went to his house and had a long discussion with him along with his officials. We came down to five points which he promised to implement within the next 10 days. After this, 20 days passed, and we didn't hear anything from him. The Congress MLAs and ministers were getting restless,” said Rawat. He said 43 MLAs signed a letter against Amarinder demanding a CLP meeting. Rawat said Sonia Gandhi also spoke to Amarinder about the complaints signed by the 43 MLAs. Ridiculing Rawat’s remarks that he seemed to be under pressure, Amarinder said the only pressure he had been under for the past few months was that of his own loyalty to Congress, because of which he continued to tolerate insult after insult. “If the party did not intend to humiliate me then why was Navjot Singh Sidhu allowed to openly criticise and attack me on social media and other public platforms for months? Why did the party give the rebels, led by Sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? Why was no cognizance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins I handed over to the party through the four and a half years I was in the saddle,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rawat-targets-capt-over-secular-credentials-he-hits-back-at-pathetic-congress/articleshow/86695165.cms||---

While economic indicators have been showing a steady increase, GST collections have remained over Rs 1 lakh crore, barring a surprise fall in collections in August over July. But the latest number, based on transactions in August, indicates that the previous month’s numbers were a blip. The latest data indicates a slowdown in collections from domestic transactions with central and state GST mop up rising under 1% in September, compared to the previous month. It was largely IGST, which saw a 10% rise compared to August, that drove up overall collections, while cess on imported goods saw a decline. The government was, however, of an improvement in the coming months. “The average monthly gross GST collection for the second quarter of the current year has been Rs 1.15 lakh crore, which is 5% higher than the average monthly collection of Rs 1.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of the year. This clearly indicates that the economy is recovering at a fast pace. Coupled with economic growth, anti-evasion activities, especially action against fake billers have also been contributing to the enhanced GST collections. It is expected that the positive trend in the revenues will continue and the second half of the year will post higher revenues,” an official statement said. Even tax experts said the festival season will provide a boost. “With the economy having largely recovered from the lows of the pandemic, the GST collections have also stabilised. With the festive season coming up, we can expect an uptick in collections,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY. Officials reckon that a rationalisation of rates and further widening of the base will boost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-collection-in-september-crosses-rs-1-17-lakh-crore/articleshow/86695793.cms||---
---||World||We're gonna get it done: Biden on spending bills||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden vowed Friday to get his sweeping domestic agenda over the line as he visited the US Congress to energise Democrats negotiating for a second day on twin make-or-break spending bills that could define his legacy -- or spell crippling political failure.  "I'm telling you, we're going to get this done," he told reporters after meeting with House Democrats who are deeply divided on a spending spree that Biden says would restore America's battered middle class.  "It doesn't matter when. It doesn't matter whether it's in six minutes, six days or six weeks, we're gonna get it done."  The unusual presidential visit follows weeks of trips by party leaders in the other direction to the White House as Biden tries to get the two ambitious spending plans passed into law.  One would funnel $1.2 trillion into repairing infrastructure and the other would allocate even more for education, child care, and promoting clean energy.  "These are his proposals. These are his bold ideas," Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.  "This is his plan that he's outlined: to not just rebuild our roads, our railways and bridges, and put millions of people back to work, but also to make child care, elder care, (pre-school programs) more cost effective, to address the climate crisis. And he wants to make the case directly to members."  Biden's political legacy is at stake and so probably are the Democrats' chances of keeping control of Congress in midterm elections next year.  However, on Thursday, a game of chicken between moderate Democrats and more leftwing members over the bills ended in stalemate.  Their razor-thin majority in Congress means that even a few defections could prevent votes from succeeding.  Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the fractious House Democrats, delayed a vote on infrastructure Thursday as congressional leaders arbitrated disputes among the party's centrist and left groupings.  - Trust issue - The impasse on the Democratic side is rooted in political differences over how much the government should spend, but also on the sheer lack of trust between competing factions.  On one side, moderate senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- popularly dubbed the "Manchinema" duo -- refuse to back the proposed $3.5 trillion price tag for the social spending package.  They do, however, support something more modest, with Manchin proposing $1.5 trillion. They also have already voted in favor of the separate $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.  Over in the House, a younger, fiery generation of more leftwing representatives insists on keeping the $3.5 trillion number for social spending, or at least something close.  And to maintain negotiating leverage, they are refusing to back the popular infrastructure bill, saying this can only come once they know they have a "yes" from the Democratic-controlled Senate for the social spending deal.  "If there's something else that's short of a vote, that somebody can offer me that gives me those same assurances, I want to listen to that," Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters, in a hint that the left might be willing to compromise.  "But right now I'm still saying we need a vote."  Psaki said the administration's outreach to congressional Democrats and their staff had included at least 300 phone calls or meetings since September 1.  During the 2020 campaign Biden repeatedly touted his dealmaking chops -- established during his four decades as a senator -- but he has made the journey up to Capitol Hill only rarely as president.  His in-person visit was a welcome development to rank-and-file Democrats who have been voicing hope he would get more deeply involved.  On Friday Pelosi must decide whether to try again for a vote on the infrastructure bill, despite the risk that progressives will kill it.  Alternatively, she could put everything on ice to buy time for crafting an overall agreement on the two bills.  There is no hard timeline for action on either bill, however, and Biden will not see the lack of progress as a defeat unless it starts dragging into the election year.  With a threatened government shutdown averted until December, the next urgent deadline is to raise the national debt limit ahead of the default date of October 18 -- and there is still no plan on how to accomplish it.  Usually this is not a complicated issue. This year, though, Republicans are refusing to join Democrats in granting authorization, while Democrats argue they should not have to bear responsibility alone.  The standoff leaves the United States close to the cliff edge of a default on its $28 trillion debt, with the lack of progress expected to soon start raising pulses in the financial markets.

The Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0 and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0, which aim to make cities and towns garbage free and water secure, will involve cumulative expenditure of Rs 4.3 lakh crore, over two-and-half times more than the total expenditure on the first phase of the two missions. Launching the schemes, the PM said the country is moving towards 100% access to clean drinking water. On AMRUT 2.0, he said it aims at “improving sewage and septic management” and making cities water-secure. The PM said there is need to ensure that “no sewage drain falls in any river”. On the contribution of sanitation workers, Modi said, “The great actors (mahanayak) of Swachh Bharat Mission are our swachhta workers, safai mitras, brothers and sisters engaged in sweeping and those who segregate the solid waste withstanding the stench of garbage”. Invoking B R Ambedkar, Modi said the two missions will eliminate inequality among people who have shifted to cities from their villages. He said Ambedkar believed urbanisation is the medium to eliminate inequalities. He cited how improvement in sanitation in Gujarat attracted tourists and urged states to take steps to improve cleanliness and sanitation. The PM also urged municipal leaders and officers to promote PM Svanidhi scheme, which entitles street vendors to get subsidised loans for their business. He said this will not only take them out from the cycle of paying high interest to informal lenders but also help financial cleaning in the “grassroot level”. He said over 46 lakh street vendors have come forward to avail benefits under the scheme and 25 lakh of them have received Rs 2,500 crore. The PM said these vendors are promoting digital transactions and maintaining a very good record of paying back their loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/make-cities-totally-garbage-free-says-pm-as-he-launches-swachh-bharat-2-0/articleshow/86695884.cms||Dipak K Dash

The consumer court said there was no proof that the cancer had been caused by the patient’s smoking habit. The case involved one Alok Kumar Banerjee from Thaltej, who underwent treatment for adenocarcinoma of the lung from Vedanta Institute of Medical Science in July 2014 and incurred a medical bill of Rs 93,297. He had medical insurance cover. But his claim was rejected by the insurer. After Banerjee passed away, his widow Smita sued the insurer in 2016 in the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad (additional), where the insurance company took the defence that Banerjee was treated in different hospitals for his illness, which had a direct nexus with his smoking habit, and that this was reflected in his case papers. The consumer commission did not agree. It cited a higher forum’s order and said that a discharge summary itself cannot be treated as primary or conclusive evidence in the absence of any independent proof. There was no evidence in this case to show that the patient got cancer because of smoking. The insurance company’s doctor gave a medical opinion that those who smoke have a 26 times higher risk of getting cancer. To this, the commission said that merely on the basis of this opinion it cannot be concluded that the patient got cancer due to his smoking habit. Those who do not smoke also get lung cancer and it cannot be believed that all those who smoke have lung cancer. It cannot be accepted that the complainant’s husband got cancer because of his smoking habit and the insurer had wrongly rejected the claim, the commission added. Besides ordering the insurer to refund the medical expense, the commission has asked it to pay Rs 5,000 extra to the complainant towards compensation for mental harassment and legal expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/non-smokers-get-cancer-too-insurer-cant-stub-claim/articleshow/86696472.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Business||Amit Shah-led panel of ministers to take final call on AI sale in a week’s time||NEW DELHI: State-run carrier Air India could be headed back to its founder Tata group, which has outbid the other contender, a consortia comprising of SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh. Final approval for the keenly awaited sale is likely to come from a panel of senior ministers led by Union home minister Amit Shah within a week, sources said on Friday. A panel of secretaries that met earlier this week had fixed the reserve price for the sale and the Tata group is learnt to have emerged as a front-runner. “They (the Tata group) bid aggressively. A final call will be taken by the Air India specific alternative mechanism,” a source said, referring to the panel of ministers that will decide the winner, but did not elaborate. Efforts are on to get the meeting convened within a week and the sale is likely to be wrapped within this month, the first privatisation of a state-run entity almost 20 years since the Atal Behari Vajpayee government pushed ahead with a raft of such transactions. The other members of the panel of ministers are finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal and civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. Several attempts have been made to sell off the loss-making Air India in the past 20 years but those attempts had to be aborted due to a string of factors, including lack of interest from investors for the cash-guzzling airline. Almost 21 years ago, an attempt to sell a stake in the airline had to be abandoned by then disinvestment minister Arun Shourie after Singapore Airlines, which bid with the Tata group for a 40% stake in the airline, pulled out of the consortium. Earlier on Friday, finance ministry officials said the winner will be shortly decided, while terming media reports of having approved any party’s bid as “incorrect.” “Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI disinvestment case are incorrect. Media will be informed of the government decision as and when it is taken,” department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Twitter. In the last one week, the government has set the reserve price for AI, which is learnt to be in the range of Rs 15,000-20,000 crore. Tata bid is learnt to be higher than the reserve price and much more than Ajay Singh-led consortia’s bid. The airline was nationalised in 1953 and if the sale goes through, it is now looking at a home-coming to the Tata group after almost 68 years. On October 15, 1932, J R D Tata had flown the first-ever flight of Tata Air Services from Karachi’s Drigh Road Aerodrome to Mumbai’s Juhu Airstrip via Ahmedabad on a single engine De Havilland Puss Moth carrying 25 kg of 4-anna airmail letters. Tata Aviation Service was the forerunner to Tata Airlines and Air India. The winner will get AI’s intangible assets like 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at Indian airports; and 900 slots at airports abroad. The winner will also get AI Express and AI’s 50% stake in AI-SATS ground handling company. AI had a total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as on March 31, 2019. The buyer will need to take on debt of Rs 23,286.5 crore. The remaining amount will be transferred to an SPV, Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL). The SPV will monetise AI’s assets like property and land bank and use those funds to pay off the debt. The sale of Air India is expected to spur the government to put other stake sales such as BPCL, Shipping Corporation of India, Concor, BEML on the fast track. It is also expected to bring in greater urgency to accelerate work on the privatisation of two state-run banks and an insurance company. Work is on in full swing for the mega initial public offer (IPO) of state-run insurance behemoth LIC. The government has set a target of raising Rs 1.75 lakh crore from disinvestment of state-run firms for the current fiscal year and also has a wider agenda of privatisation in the pipeline. In addition, it is also working on a Rs 6-lakh crore asset monetisation pipeline over the next fours years to raise much needed funds to shore up infrastructure across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amit-shah-led-panel-of-ministers-to-take-final-call-on-ai-sale-in-a-weeks-time/articleshow/86696534.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Raipur||Opportunity, not a tug of war: T S Singhdeo on Chhattisgarh political situation||RAIPUR: Amid the simmering political crisis in the ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh, senior minister T S Singhdeo on Friday described the political situation as an “opportunity and not a tug of war within the party”, reiterating that the high command has ‘reserved’ its decision. Chhattisgarh Congress is locked in a battle of nerves for the past couple of months over a purported formula for mid-term change of guard. Both chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and Singhdeo have separately met the party leadership, including Rahul Gandhi. “Everyone met the high command, which later reserved its decision. As of now, one should consider that no decision has been taken. Nobody knows about the decision,” Singhdeo told reporters in Raipur on Friday. The dozen-odd Congress legislators — mostly first-time MLAs — who were camping in Delhi for the last two days to lobby against any change of guard in the state are now returning to Raipur after failing to get an audience with the party leadership. The MLAs, said to be Baghel loyalists, had landed in Delhi just when the Punjab crisis had erupted and the high command was in a desperate firefight. The Chhattisgarh Congress MLAs dash to Delhi at such a critical time, and the public statement of legislator Brihaspat Singh against any change of guard haven’t gone down well with the high command, say sources. The timing of the unscheduled Delhi visit of the MLAs created a perception in sections of Congress that it was designed to create a media buzz and mount pressure against any change of guard. Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee president Mohan Markam, who is also a legislator, found it difficult to explain if the frequent Delhi visits of MLAs and their public statements on the political situation amount to party indiscipline. ‘Keeping watch on matters that come to light through media’ The party is keeping a watch on matters that have come to light through the media. Let’s wait and see what happens,” he said, adding that CM Baghel and health minister T S Singhdeo have maintained that legislators, like any other citizen, are free to travel anywhere. Trouble began brewing in the state Congress in the last week of August following intense speculation about a possible change of guard on a purported formula apparently agreed upon after the 2018 election victory. Hectic parleys took place in Delhi where Baghel and Singhdeo met with central leaders. Since then, there is an atmosphere of uncertainty in the ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh, with Baghel loyalists frequenting Delhi and Singhdeo maintaining that he is awaiting the high command’s decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/opportunity-not-a-tug-of-war-singhdeo-on-cg-political-situation/articleshow/86696662.cms||---
---||Business||Factory activity expands at faster pace in Sept||NEW DELHI: Stronger demand conditions and easing of Covid-19 curbs helped activity in the country’s factory sector to maintain its growth momentum and added to the business confidence in the months ahead, a survey showed on Friday. Rising from 52.3 in August to 53.7 in September, the IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) highlighted a stronger expansion in overall business conditions across the sector. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2021-22, the PMI averaged 53.8, a significant improvement from 51.5 in the opening quarter. With sales rising at a stronger rate, firms scaled up production and purchased additional inputs. There was also a faster upturn in international sales and an improvement in business confidence, the survey showed. “Indian manufacturers lifted production to a greater extent in September as they geared up for improvements in demand and the replenishment of stocks. There was a substantial pick-up in intakes of new work, with some contribution from international markets,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. A string of economic indicators over the past few months have pointed to a robust recovery underway after curbs were lifted, following easing of Covid-19 cases and sharp increase in vaccination across the country. Economists expect overall economic growth to be in double digits and closer to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forecast of 9.5% growth in the current fiscal year that ends in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/factory-activity-expands-at-faster-pace-in-sept/articleshow/86696693.cms||---

Speaking to media persons in Dharamshala on Thursday, CTA president Penpa Tsering said, “Having considered the varying degrees of repression inside Tibet, which is always followed by a series of claims and counter-claims... the only way forward now is to have the Chinese government come on board to accept the mutually beneficial middle way approach proposed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and approved by the Tibetan people as the only viable solution for a long-lasting resolution of Sino-Tibetan conflict.” Sikyong said the 96-page official response released by the CTA comprehensively highlights the factual chronological events countering China’s narrative on Tibet regarding its historical status. “It is not 70 years of liberation, but 70 years of suppression and oppression,” he said. He added that the so-called “peaceful liberation of Tibet”, as claimed by China, is just a cover-up for advancing the Chinese communist ideology. The official response details the facts of the landmark 17-point agreement and its successive violations by the Chinese counterpart. It extensively explains the various aspects of the party’s domination over Tibetan people to enforce their dependency on it. It focuses on the violations of the rights of Tibetans through intensive measures such as mass surveillance in the name of national security, and marginalisation of the Tibetan language at schools to destroy the core identity of Tibetans. “The education policy implemented by China in the last 70 years is only aimed at destroying the Tibetan language and hence, Tibetan identity,” Sikyong added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cta-releases-tibet-70-years-of-occupation-and-oppression/articleshow/86693520.cms||---
---||Kolkata||No-entry order at pandals no hurdle for Kumartuli artists; deliveries to start on Sun||Kolkata: Artists in Kumartuli said the court order barring visitors from entering pandals did not impact the size of the idol in any way and they were in the process of providing finishing touches. Many organisers had already ordered idols that were at most 10ft tall since pandal size has been reduced, and some were anticipating restrictions. The idols will start rolling out from Sunday since several pandals are inaugurated on Mahalaya itself. “None of the organisers has given us a distress call. We made most of Friday since it was sunny and tried to finish most of the work. Delivery should start from early next week,” said Kartik Pal, secretary of the idolmakers’ association in Kumartuli. Several Puja organisers said they had taken care at the planning stage itself so that people will be able to see the deity from a distance and might not have to make any large-scale deviations from their original plan due to the HC order. Organisers also said they had ensured all team members involved in the preparations, including the priest, were fully vaccinated. “Our pandal is going to be open on all sides so people can view the deity from a distance. There will also be some screens put up outside. The puja will be organised following all the norms,” said Biswajit Prasad, secretary of Dum Dum Tarun Dal. The crowd pullers of south Kolkata, like Chetla Agrani, Ekdalia Evergreen Club and Suruchi Sangha, had also factored in last-minute guidelines from the authorities. “The idea is to organise a Durga Puja which is safe for everybody,” said Swapan Mahapatra, treasurer of Ekdalia Evergreen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-entry-order-at-pandals-no-hurdle-for-kumartuli-artists-deliveries-to-start-on-sun/articleshow/86691601.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Cops said that the cattle breeders found the misfired shells of rocket launchers near the firing butt of the defence forces in Devbhumi Dwarka district and later sold it to scrap collectors. The area near the firing range comes under the prohibited category, the cops said. On Monday, the police had arrested Tofiq Dosani a resident of Upleta and Mohan Koli a resident of Bhatiya town in Devbhumi Dwarka district for selling the shell of a rocket launcher to one of the blast victims, Rajak Kana. During interrogation, the accused revealed that they had purchased the shells from scrap collectors, Mahesh and Kanak Rathod. After being arrested, Mahesh and Kanak admitted that they got the shells from Manu Ker and Teja Gadhvi, cattle breeders who ventured into the prohibited area and didn’t inform the authorities about the shells, thinking that they would get a good price in the scrap market. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-more-held-over-scrapyard-blast-in-upleta/articleshow/86690997.cms||---

---||Business||Zee board rejects investor call for shareholders’ meet||MUMBAI: The Zee Entertainment Enterprises’ board declined largest shareholder Invesco’s request for a special shareholders’ meet to remove MD Punit Goenka from the company, citing the requisition to be “invalid and illegal”. The development intensifies the battle between the US fund and the board of Zee, in which Invesco holds about 18%. The board’s decision comes a day after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directed it to consider Invesco’s request to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove Goenka and appoint multiple independent directors. On Friday, Zee said its board decided not to hold an EGM because Invesco’s demand suffered from multiple legal infirmities. “The board has arrived at this decision by referring to various non-compliances under multiple laws... after taking into account the interests of all the company’s shareholders.” Zee said the board’s decision was based on the legal advice it received from experts, including retired Supreme Court judges. The seven-member board comprises one non-independent director (Goenka) and six independent directors. Since Goenka was an interested party, he did not participate in Friday’s board meeting, the company said. Zee will submit the board’s reply to the petition filed by Invesco in NCLT, which will hear the matter on October 4. Explaining the reasons for rejecting Invesco’s request, Zee said, the US fund’s proposal to appoint 50% of the company’s board would result in “it effecting a change in control of the company without making an open offer”. However, a lawyer said Invesco has sought the appointment of “independent directors” on Zee board and “not their nominee directors”, raising doubts whether this would tantamount to change in control. Besides, according to Invesco’s governing guidelines, the US fund cannot hold more than 20% in any stock, which means it cannot make an open offer. Zee further said that its Articles of Association (AoA) does not allow more than 12 directors on the board. Since the proposal to remove Goenka cannot be legally effectuated, and the proposal to appoint six independent directors are effected, the Zee board would consist of 13 members, which would be contrary to its (AoA), it said. Zee also said that the I&B ministry requires that to effect any change in the CEO and the board of a company their permission needs to be taken in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-board-rejects-investor-call-for-shareholders-meet/articleshow/86695827.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The byelection is scheduled to be held on October 30. BJP state president and MP Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal announced their candidatures at a joint press conference of NDA leaders in the state capital on Friday. Besides BJP and JD(U), former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of Mukesh Sahani are the two other NDA constituents in Bihar. The byelection in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats was necessitated following the death of JD(U) MLAs Shashi Bhushan Hajari and Mewalal Choudhari, respectively. “We have fielded Aman Bhushan, the son of three-time former MLA Shashi Bhushan Hazari, from Kusheshwar Asthan. We wanted to field Mewalal’s son in Tarapur, but he expressed his inability to contest the byelection because he lives in the USA. Therefore, we have fielded Rajiv, who has been associated with us since the Samata Party days,” JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh said. “Rajiv is a well-known leader in Tarapur since the days of formation of the erstwhile Samata Party, which later merged into the JD(U) in 2003. Rajiv had earlier contested the assembly polls from Tarapur -- once as the Samata Party candidate and twice on the JD(U) ticket. But Rajiv lost all the three elections to RJD’s then candidate Shakuni Choudhary, who had won the Tarapur seat for record six times from 1985 to 2010,” a senior JD(U) leader told TOI. VIP president Sahani, HAM-S national general secretary Santosh Kumar Suman and panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary, who hails from Tarapur area, also addressed the joint press conference and claimed victory of both the NDA candidates. Samrat is the son of former minister Shakuni Choudhary. Other prominent leaders who were present at the press conference included senior BJP leader and deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, JD(U)’s parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and building construction minister Ashok Choudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nda-names-candidates-for-k-asthan-tarapur-seats/articleshow/86688815.cms||Madan Kumar

The heavy rains have washed away the tar and soil, creating potholes and cracks in several major junctions of the city. Many interior and arterial roads have long been lying in poor condition in the city, seeking immediate intervention by the officials. Even before the cyclone, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) estimated that the road repair works would cost about Rs 110 crore to its exchequer. The road damages from Cyclone Gulab are now pegged at Rs 21 crore. The ongoing underground cable-laying works, which have been going on since the devastation wreaked by Cyclone Hudhud, and other development works, which involve digging of the roads have also turned out to be a daunting exercise for the residents of various colonies in the city. Several roads in areas such as One Town, Convent Junction, Gopalapatnam, Muralinagar, Hanumanthawaka, Autonagar industrial area, Visalakshi Nagar, etc. are in a bad shape. Potholes have surfaced even on the national highway passing through the city. Motorists lament the poor condition of the roads. Speaking to TOI, Dwaram Swamy, a resident of Pithapuram Colony, rued the bad shape of the roads. “Almost all major stretches of the city are riddled with potholes, even including the national highway. I am very much concerned about the two-wheeler riders as the roads would pose a risk to them. Road repair works need to be taken up on a war-footing note in the interests of the public,” said Swamy. GVMC CPI(M) corporator Dr Ganga Rao had staged a novel protest on Thursday by repairing a damaged road in the city. “The GVMC should immediately take up the road repair works. We will intensify our fight, if restoration of damaged roads is not taken up in the next few weeks,” said Ganga Rao. B Ravi Teja, a resident of Marripalem, said that it is becoming hard for the motorists to drive on the bad roads as they are giving a bumpy ride for them. When contacted, the engineering officials of the GVMC said that works on all damaged roads will be taken up soon. The major road network of Vizag city is about 126 km, while the total road length is about 2,200 km. As per the reports prepared by the GVMC before the cyclone, as many as 629 roads, spanning about 338 km, were damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/potholes-and-cracks-gulab-turns-vizag-into-a-crater-city/articleshow/86688403.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

With the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) releasing the schedule of first year examinations and announcing that exams would begin from October 25, 2021, parents have complained that colleges were pressurizing them to clear fee dues. “I have already cleared first year fees of my daughter and paid another Rs 10, 000 towards the fee of the intermediate second year, but college is asking us to clear the entire second year fee,” a parent, whose daughter is studying in intermediate second year at a corporate college in the city, said. He questioned the reason behind asking him to clear the entire second year fee in the mid of the academic year. “These are first year exams. I have already cleared the fee. Why should the management ask me to clear second year fee as well at this stage?” the parent questioned. Another parent, whose son is studying at a private college in Uppal, said, “I went and paid the entire second year fee after the management threatened to withhold hall-tickets. Instead of supporting during the pandemic, they are making us pay the full fee in advance,” the parent added. Faculty working at various private junior colleges in the city said that they have received instructions from management to warn students of consequences of not paying fees.“A majority of colleges have instructed their faculty to intimate students that they will not be given hall-tickets if the fee is not cleared. They are using this opportunity to get fee dues,” said A Santosh Kumar, president, Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association. The private junior college managements said that they need to get the fee from about 65% of parents in the last academic year. This year, they said that they have not received fees from majority of the students. “We are not threatening to withhold hall-tickets. Instead of keeping silent when asked to clear dues, parents should talk to managements and come to an understanding and let them know by when they can clear the fee,” said Satish G, president, Telangana Private Junior Colleges Managements Association.

He said the programme will be implemented in both rural and urban areas for 100 days from October 2. Speaking to the media here on Friday, the minister rubbished the BJP’s claim that the CLAP programme is being taken up with central funds. “It is totally a state government programme and initiated by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy,” said Satyanarayana.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Crowds outside pandals still a threat, fear doctors||KOLKATA: The lifting of night curfew during Puja should not be taken as an excuse to ignore Covid safety norms or else there could be a spurt in numbers immediately after the festival like last year, warned health experts. Even though vaccination may restrict the number of affected, transmission could still lead to severe disease among a sizeable section of the population, they feared. The first wave had reached its peak in Kolkata during the Puja in 2020. Although they welcomed the ban of entry into pandals doctors warned that crowding around them could be just as dangerous. “There’s still a possibility of transmission rising after the pujas if precautions are ignored,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. TimesViewThe focus should not veer from Covid-containment measures and protocols. Festival seasons are often followed by spikes, which can be painful.There should be strict vigil to prevent gathering outside pandals, said physician Arindam Biswas. “Any rise in transmission could be dangerous since it will prolong the pandemic. The longer Covid persists, the higher will be the possibility of a mutation in the virus which could lead to another wave with a more virulent attack,” said Biswas. Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research professor Diptendra Sarkar said, “Three factors will have to be borne in mind while celebrating. Covid is still active and the transmission rate remains above one, which means every infected person is still passing on the virus to at least one more. Secondly, Bengal has so far vaccinated around 60% of its adult, eligible population, which is around 5.8 crore. We must reach 10 crore to be sufficiently protected. We also have an unvaccinated section which includes children who are susceptible.” While it’s not feasible to curb festivities entirely, revellers should remember that positivity rate has not dropped over the last two months, said a microbiologist. “It has been consistent at 1.6%-1.8% since the beginning of August. So, we can’t yet say Covid has receded. Ignoring norms could lead to a swell in a fortnight, like last year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crowds-outside-pandals-still-a-threat-fear-docs/articleshow/86691634.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Action plan to desilt canals after NGT prod||KOLKATA: The state has geared up to file an action plan on drainage upgrade and desiltation work of Bagjola and Kestopur Canals, the two prime drainage outfall channels for New Town, Salt Lake and large parts of Rajarhat, by mid December, following the order of the NGT eastern zonal bench. The irrigation department will conduct a survey of the condition of both canals before taking up dredging and desiltation work in December. All stakeholders, including the irrigation department, NKDA, Hidco and KMDA, along with Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and South Dum Dum Municipality, will be involved in revamping the Bagjola and Kestopur Canals with a six-month deadline, before the next monsoon. TimesViewWe must stick to the schedule stated in the NGT. Completion by next May, before the onset of monsoon 2022, is important.The authorities have held primary discussions on the waterlogging issue. Irrigation department officials said a plan has been approved by the Central Water Commission to upgrade the 1,650 cusec discharge capacity pump house at Kulti outfall off Bagjola Canal into a 4,000 cusec pump house. This will help flush out excess storm water even if some of the pumps do not work. Green activist and Amicus Curiae of the case Subhas Datta said, “The past dredging and desilting of these outfall channels lacked transparency and residents were hardly relieved of the waterlogging trauma. It is a matter of great solace to me that the entire process of desiltation will be carried out under the strict watch of the NGT. Moreover, the NGT has shown great interest in including the restoration and maintenance of the Kestopur channel in the National Mission for Clean Ganga project for its connection with the Ganga.” Hidco has come up with a blueprint to revamp its portion of Bagjola Canal that flows through New Town and Rajarhat, and will finalise the plans for implementation after meetings with the irrigation department. The entire lower Bagjola Canal stretch will be dredged and desilted. Hidco has come up with proposals to increase the height of the banks, to repair the lock-gates and to set up new drainage pumping stations. The authorities are also planning to carve out a dedicated channel for draining excess storm water from Salt Lake and New Town, which would link with Kestopur and Bagjola Canals. Hidco is taking up work to excavate and dispose of the earth of the periphery canals linking with Bagjola Canal.  BMC also had talks with KMDA to put up iron fence on the sides of Kestopur Canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/action-plan-to-desilt-canals-after-ngt-prod/articleshow/86691691.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Ration only for those who have authenticated Aadhaar||AMARAVATI: Enforcing the instructions issued by the Centre, the state government has decided not to release ration for those who have not completed e-KYC by linking Aadhaar. The government will release ration to only to those who have already authenticated Aadhaar. Civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar said the e-KYC rule will be implemented starting October. Speaking to the media on Friday, Sasidhar clarified that the process of eKYC was not taken up either to remove ration cards or reduce the ration quota. He said it was taken up to help migrant workers draw their ration anywhere in the country as part of the one-nation, one-ration concept of the Centre. Sasidhar said notices for those who have not complied with e-KYC norms were issued in July and they were given three months to complete the process. He said the Centre had made it a must to complete e-KYC linking Aadhaar for all holders of a ration card to enable them to take stock anywhere in the country. “In case, three members of a family of four completed the e-KYC, the ration will be released for three members. The quota of the fourth member will be released as and when they complete the authentication,” said Sasidhar. He said children below the age of five have been exempted from e-KYC authentication, adding they will be automatically authenticated through their parents by the local village/ward volunteer. He said the deadline for completion of Aadhaar linking ended in August but was extended till September keeping in view requests from public. “We have released the ration quota for all members of the ration cards. However, the ration will be distributed only proportionate to the members who completed Aadhaar,” said Sasidhar. He said elderly people or daily wagers whose fingerprints have been tallied with those on the device could complete the eKYC with the help of fusion finger mode on the e-PoS machine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ration-only-for-those-who-have-authenticated-aadhaar/articleshow/86688450.cms||Samdani MN
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Man held with Rs 2 lakh fake notes in Nagaur||JAIPUR: Nagaur police on Friday arrested a 29-year-old man with Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) of Rs 1.97 lakh during a crackdown in the Ladnun area. SHO Rajendra Singh told TOI that a special input was received that some members of the gang were planning to disburse fake notes at the petrol pump and other places. “We have arrested one Bandu Khan with the fake currency notes. The seized notes are of very high quality and can not be easily distinguished from the real ones,” he said. Nagaru police said that the Special Operations Group (SOG) a few days ago had arrested the gang’s kingpin, Rafique Khan from the Rambagh area of Jaipur. Soon after the kingpin’s arrest in Jaipur, the Nagaur police received input that other members of the gang were still in possession of FICNs and were desperately looking for some people to trade fakes notes with. “Since Bandu Khan was a local resident of Ladnun area, it became very important for us to keep the entire operation under tight wraps. We constituted a special team which included only for cops,” Singh said. The police teams started a decoy operation and found that Bandu Khan used “Kachra” (trash) as a codename for fake currency notes. Police also found that the accused were frequently changing the locations of the places where cash was kept. “They hid these wads of notes in abandoned havelis and houses,” Singh said. Police said that Bandu Khan had nearly Rs 3 lakh of fake currency notes. “We suspect that some of the FICNs were also distributed by the accused. We are trying to find the people who brought these notes from him,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-held-with-rs-2-lakh-fake-notes-in-nagaur/articleshow/86693567.cms||---

---||Trichy||Unveil Sivaji Ganesan’s statue in Trichy: Fans||TRICHY: Fans of thespian Sivaji Ganesan urged the state government to unveil his statue in Trichy city that has remained covered for over a decade now. While the fans, on the birth anniversary of the popular actor on Friday, cited official apathy as the cause, Trichy Corporation claimed that a legal hurdle has prevented the unveiling of the statue. In 2011, a 9-foot statue of the actor was erected by various Sivaji Ganesan fans’ associations through crowdfunding at a cost of Rs 9 lakh. The bronze statue was positioned in the Palakkarai roundabout near Prabhat Theatre where the actor’s movies were released predominantly. On the location of the statue, fans claimed that Sivaji Ganesan, for a brief period, stayed at Sangliyandapuram, a residential locality near Palakkarai. Initially, as the conduct of the state assembly election in 2011 deferred the unveiling, the fans said that even after the election result, it remained covered. “Sivaji Ganesan continues to be one of the identities of Tamil cinema, well-known for his articulation and control over the language. Despite these contributions, his statue has been left abandoned,” said R Venkatraman, advisor, Sivaji Ganesan fans association, Trichy rural. The fans also claimed that the roundabout where the statue was situated was not properly maintained. As the statue was established during the DMK’s regime in 2006-2011, the late actor’s fans have appealed to the chief minister M K Stalin to take steps to unveil the statue. Meanwhile, the corporation sources said that a case is pending with the high court pertaining to lack of clearance in erecting the bronze statue at a public spot. “Permission was not provided by the public department, state government to unveil the statue. A case challenging the establishment is under litigation. If only a verdict was passed, we can take decisive action,” an official source from the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/unveil-sivaji-ganesans-statue-in-trichy-fans/articleshow/86693536.cms||---

---||Patna||Woman sacked as mukhiya for fin fraud allowed to file papers||PATNA: The Patna high court on Friday granted interim relief to a woman, who had been sacked as the mukhiya of Lohdan panchayat under Chand block in Kaimur district for funds embezzlement, and directed the district magistrate to accept her nomination papers for contesting the ongoing panchayat election. Friday was the last day to file nomination papers for Lohdan panchayat, which will go to the polls on October 20. The court fixed October 7 for the final hearing of the matter. Petitioner Hirawati Devi was sacked from her post after inquiry by the panchayati raj department principal secretary on October 28, 2019 for allegedly defalcating Rs33.97 lakh meant for developmental projects under the government’s Saat Nishchay programmes. She was held guilty for misconduct in discharging duty and misappropriating funds and, thus, had been barred from contesting election for five years as per Rule 18(6) of Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006. Later, Hirawati had deposited Rs35.22 lakh, including simple interest, in the panchayat bank account. However, the department had ordered to recover the defalcated money with compound interest for the time the amount remained with her. She had moved the high court on November 16, 2019 challenging her removal on the grounds of procedural irregularities. However, a single bench denied her any relief observing that the principal secretary was right in his action and there was no procedural irregularity. The court had also observed that she had deposited the amount along with simple interest after two years only to escape penal action. During the argument in hearing of the appeal, counsel Rajeev Kumar Singh submitted that proper inquiry as per Bihar Panchayat (inspection of offices and inquiry into affairs, supervision and guidelines) Rules 2014 was not conducted. He also apprised the court that there was no order from the DM to conduct an inquiry against the petitioner, as per the 2014 rules. Singh submitted that no action was taken against the secretary of the Lohdan panchayat for defalcation of funds. He also apprised the court that in similar circumstances, the same principal secretary had allowed other mukhiyas to contest election by pardoning them for defalcation on the grounds that they had returned the money. Government counsel Dhirendra Kumar submitted that the department’s action was taken as per rules and regulations. The division bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Anjani Kumar Sharan was prima facie satisfied with the submission of petitioner’s counsel and granted interim relief to Hirawati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-sacked-as-mukhiya-for-fin-fraud-allowed-to-file-papers/articleshow/86688676.cms||Debashish Karmakar

These families have been living in temporary sheds for more than eight years in inhuman condition after their houses and agricultural land were swallowed by the Ganga in July 2013. A high-level committee had decided on February 20, 2019 that each of the 159 families should be given four-decimal land for rehabilitation. The land has to be purchased by the revenue and land reforms department. A writ petition in nature of PIL was filed in the high court by one Ranjeet Ram and Urmila Devi in December last year, who urged the court to direct the authorities concerned to rehabilitate the 159 affected families. The matter was taken up for hearing by the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar on Monday. However, the court’s order came into public domain on Thursday. The court has directed the DMD principal secretary to file a report within four weeks on the matter. It fixed November 15 as the next date of hearing in the matter. As per the PIL, the families were to be rehabilitated at Hathiyakant village and even Rs 12.72 crore was released following a revenue and land reforms department resolution on December 31, 2014.

The injured victim was found by the locals, who later informed the police upon which he was admitted at Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital (LLR) in a critical condition. The police have started investigating the matter and searching for the attackers. The victim, identified as Mamtesh Pasi, a resident of Ompurwa Tadikhana (Chakeri) is a car driver. As per Pasi's father Sohan Lal, on August 1, Pasi went to a ‘bhandara’ (community feast) organised in the area to take ‘prasad, where he was assaulted by a few men on charges of stealing animals. After the incident, Sohan Lal had filed a case against them and since then the accused had enmity against the father and the son.

---||Vadodara||Sinking feeling in Sanskarinagari||Vadodara: The ‘cultural capital of Gujarat’ is in deep hole. Within a couple of days, three huge craters have appeared on prominent roads in the city including one in which a truck got stuck. The first crater had appeared on Thursday on the Productivity Road. This was followed by one on the Gotri-Vasna Road. And on Friday, a truck’s wheel got stuck in a crater near the Ayurvedic College in Panigate area. Officials said that the reason for the crater on the Productivity Road was the collapse of a dead drainage line. The line was not in use after a new line had been laid in the area. A leakage in a drainage line was the reason for the cave in on the Gotri-Vasna Road. The crater near Ayurvedic College appeared because the slab of a storm water drain there could not bear the weight of a truck carrying sand. While reasons may be different, cave-ins have always troubled commuters in the city. The Productivity Road, Akota and Old Padra Road in the western parts of the city have been particularly vulnerable to craters. VMC’s executive engineer in-charge of west zone, Rajendra Vasava, said the cave-in on the Gotri-Vasna Road had taken place near a chamber and engineers of the drainage project were working to fix the problem. The craters along with potholes has led to the opposition in VMC’s elected wing calling Vadodara as ‘Khadodara’. The issue has led to heated debates and representations in the civic body periodically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sinking-feeling-in-sanskarinagari/articleshow/86690117.cms||---

Calendar year 2021 has also seen broad-based growth as PE-VC investments in both early-stage and late stage companies posted strong growth. The deal count in January to September 2021 has already reached 840 deals compared to 892 deals in the complete year 2020 and 651 deals in Jan-Sep 2020, data from Venture Intelligence shows. This tally excludes PE investments in real estate. The number of large sized deals (over $100 million in size) stood at over 100 in the nine months of 2021 compared to just 41 in the same period of 2020. Similarly, seed stage deals grew over 30% from 190 to 249 deals. Around $422 million worth seed stage investments were made by VCs in Indian startups this year compared to $216 mn last year. “While it is heartening to see the record pace of PE-VC investments in India sustaining, the highlight of the latest quarter was the successful IPOs of the Indian consumer market focused Zomato and the global enterprise SaaS focused Freshworks,” Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence, said. “Such exemplary liquidity events will expand the share of the asset allocation pie that PE-VC investing in India commands from both domestic and foreign investors,” he added. PE-VC investments in the July-September quarter stood at $20.1 billion across 368 deals — up 35% sequentially from the previous quarter and 69% compared to the same period last year. The investments in unicorns totalled to over $20 billion and accounted for close to 41% of the value pie in 2021 thus far. The July-September quarter saw over $10 billion (across 28 deals) being invested in such companies.

The condition of the roads turned from bad to worse following smart showers since Thursday. Residents of Mitra Mandal Colony and Kalyani Nagar said the PMC and the nagar parishad authorities have miserably failed to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in the localities under their jurisdictions. “Dirt and filth are lying strewn on roads. Though door-to-door trash collection is going on in the PMC areas, no one bothers to pick accumulated dirt and filth from the dustbins,” they said. The aggrieved residents have also attributed poor civic amenities in the locality to a private agency involved in laying sewerage pipe. According to them, the agency workers dig and cut roads and then leave them open. Two senior citizens of the locality, Ashok Kumar and Shankar Dayal, said the residents of PMC ward number 11 at Kalyani Nagar are literally kept confined to their houses due to “blockade” of the main road at Shivnarayn Chowk for the laying of sewerage pipe. “Potholes and ditches are filled with rainwater. To make things worse, street lights are hardly working in the locality,” said Amar, a café owner. The agency involved in laying pipelines in the locality said it had not been authorised to recast the damaged roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/civic-amenities-go-for-a-toss-in-anisabad-area/articleshow/86688410.cms||---

Self-help groups and entrepreneurs from the city had displayed over 50 types of day-to-day use products at the main office of the civic body. The corporation officials said that the exhibition was organised to display the options available to recycle and reuse the waste instead of handing it over to the civic body. Products such as cloth bags, fabric mobile cases and fabric hand purses were on display. Terrace gardening kits that can convert the food waste into manure and can subsequently utilize the compost for growing vegetables on the rooftop and terrace were made available for sale. Coinciding with the celebration of 75 years of independence and Gandhi Jayanti (October 2), officials said that such events will be conducted periodically to promote recycling to help in reducing waste generation. As many as 10 stalls displayed their recycled products for sale. “People were very enthusiastic and enquired about the production method,” Shrinidhi Umanathan, a startup founder said. A section of visitors, however, added that information about such an exhibition being held should have been given in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-expo-promotes-recycling-of-domestic-waste/articleshow/86693553.cms||---

---||Patna||Completed 55 projects pending or dead before 2005: WRD minister||PATNA: Water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Friday dismissed the opposition’s allegations that nothing much has been done to control the annual flood in the state. He said unlike the previous governments, more work has been done under the Nitish Kumar regime in the last 15 years. In this regard, Jha mentioned the process initiated for coordination with the Centre on the intra-linking of rivers in north Bihar, the use of new technologies to minimize the damage caused by the floodwaters and the completion of 55 projects which had either remained “dead or did not even take off” under the previous governments. Talking to a section of the media, Jha rubbished the charges levelled by the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who in a letter addressed to the CM had alleged the lack of effective work done to control the flood menace in Bihar. “Those who are his advisors, or even write the letters on his behalf, did not give him correct feedback. The letter talks about the construction of canals and river barrages to control the flood, but they should know that they are irrigation projects and are meant to provide water to land for irrigation purposes,” Jha said. Comparing the performance of the Nitish government vis a vis the previous governments in the state before 2005, Jha said, “What work did they do? Didn’t they tell the flood-affected people that they should go out fishing in the floodwaters? Fifteen years before, there were 55 projects which were either dead or did not take off. We have completed most of them. We will not like to talk about most of them, but the mention must be made about the completion of the old and abandoned Durgavati reservoir project, and the work in progress on the western Kosi canal.” As to the intra-linking of the rivers, Jha said 10 such schemes have been identified and the process has started with regard to the Kosi-Mechi rivers intra-linking project. He said that the Centre has sanctioned it, besides including it as a national project. Further, some initial hiccups between the state and the Centre, like the sharing of required money for completing the project, has to be also resolved. “These are time taking projects, but the work is being done,” Jha said, adding the work on other nine rivers would also be taken up in due course. According to him, the CM has also asked the WRD to identify the rivers in south Bihar for intra-linking them. “He has asked to first prepare the feasibility report. The technical feasibility is necessary to know the beneficial aspects of the project, and to ascertain which of the rivers in south Bihar could be linked,” Jha said. Referring to the use of new technologies to minimize the damage caused by the floodwaters, Jha said the World Bank aided projects were taken up in the Kosi basin after the infamous breach in the eastern afflux bund of the Kosi (Birpur) barrage at Kusaha (Nepal) in August 2008, that caused the catastrophic flood and damage in six Bihar districts. “Since then, new technologies have been used to give advance warning of the floods, which helped in minimizing the impact of floods despite heavy rainfall even this year,” Jha said, adding that the permanent solution to the flood menace lay in the construction of high dam across the Kosi in Nepal. But that would require diplomatic initiatives and talks with Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/completed-55-projects-pending-or-dead-before-2005-wrd-minister/articleshow/86688570.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Dehradun||Rawat slams Amarinder, says Capt's claim he wasn’t told about CLP meet a lie||Dehradun: In a stinging attack on former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, senior Congress leader and the party’s state in-charge for Punjab, Harish Rawat, lashed out at Singh at a press conference in Dehradun on Friday. Trashing Amarinder’s claim that he was not kept in the loop regarding the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meet to elect a new leader, Rawat said he tried getting through to the former CM for three days continuously before the meeting. “Despite being the party in-charge for the state, I couldn’t get access to him. Subsequently, his team and aides were informed about the meeting,” Rawat said. He added that later he came to know that “Amarinder told his confidantes he will not go to the CLP meeting as many types of questions would be asked there and he did not want to face an embarrassing situation”. Claiming that Amarinder’s allegations that he was being “humiliated and sidelined” by the central leadership did not hold ground, Rawat said, “How can someone of his stature, who has remained CM for almost 10 years and the PCC chief for three terms be humiliated and insulted?” On the former Punjab CM’s recent meeting with Amit Shah, Rawat said that it “raises a question mark over his secular credentials”.“Amarinder’s ideology does not align with that of BJP leaders’ and I believe they are simply using him as a mukhauta (mask),” the senior Congressman said. He added that Amarinder’s recent statements appeared as if they were “made under some sort of pressure and he should rethink and not help the BJP either directly or indirectly.” Later in the evening, Rawat posted a detailed statement on his Facebook page pertaining to Amarinder. It read, “Congress has always kept Captain Amarinder Singh and his family in high esteem…As the chief minister, he was given a complete free hand. Despite continuous reminders from his colleagues and the leadership, unfortunately, he failed to keep his promises on important issues like Bargadi, drugs, electricity, etc. There was also a general perception throughout the state that Captain and the Badals are helping each other, and they have a secret understanding.” Rawat added in his post that he was “always politely suggesting to the CM to initiate action on our election promises” . “At least five times, I discussed these issues with Captain sahib but with no result. The whole Bargadi issue was mishandled by his trusted lieutenants… many prominent ministers came to Delhi with a complaint thatwith Captain Amarinder Singh at the helm of affairs Congress can't win elections.” He added that after prolonged discussions and feedback from a panel constituted under senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge, the CM agreed on implementing "18 points" but failed to implement even one out. “The panel called Captain Amarinder Singh again and had a discussion. A time-bound implementation course was discussed and mutually agreed upon. But after going back to Chandigarh, he forgot about his promises. Born out of his stubbornness, he was of the belief that he does not need any advice from anyone, including his own MLAs, ministers and the party leadership.” Rawat wrote that matters came to a head when 43 MLAs, in a written letter to the party leadership, asked for a CLP meeting to be called since Amarinder was not acting on the promises. “When this happened, I tried to contact Amarinder Singh ji thrice, but I could not get him on telephone. Then,through one of his well-wishers, I sent him a message that there is a demand for a CLP meeting, and we have no option but to call the meeting. Despite getting the message, Captain Amarinder didn't bother to telephone me. Then I suggested to the party high command, that if we delay the matter further many MLAs may form a separate group. I then officially informed Captain Amarinder Singh that the party has called a CLP meeting and requested him to attend. In response, the CM called a separate meeting at his residence on the same day when the CLP meeting was called. ..How does this sequence of events suggest that anybody intended to humiliate him?” Rawat further wrote that “in a democratic party, all the democratic procedures were followed, and the party chose a CM who comes from a humble background.” “It was expected from Captain Amarinder Singh to bless him. He said that he will call him for lunch or tea, but nothing has happened.” Rawat said that “ the theory of humiliation is being circulated to gain the sympathy of the people... The humiliation-based sympathy politics may help a person, but it will not help Punjab. Captain Amarinder was controlling both the government and the party from his farmhouse (home). No one asks him a question regarding his absence from the secretariat, visits in the districts...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rawat-slams-amarinder-says-capts-claim-he-wasnt-told-about-clp-meet-a-lie/articleshow/86689060.cms||Kautilya Singh

However, it has denied reports that these cases are not reported on the bank’s fraud reporting system. “The bank does not waive the processing costs from customers who come forward in such discrepant/suspicious cases. The processing fee is charged towards defraying the cost of efforts of the bank for additional due diligence and verification and not for closing the cases,” HDFC Bank said. Responding to reports that frauds are not reported by the bank, the private lender said that in all cases, the bank updates its internal database to prevent any future application from the customer and also updates industry data to prevents such borrowers from indulging in similar practises with other banks, NBFCs & financial institutions. “Collection or non-collection of processing fees has no bearing on reporting to the internal & Hunter (industry) database or attempts to report to the police authorities,” the bank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-fee-refund-for-fraud-loan-applications-hdfc-bank/articleshow/86695841.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Bengal government on Friday informed Calcutta high court that the state had on September 14 decided to introduce a third column in its application for the 2021 examinations alongside male and female. The high court was hearing a petition, urging the court’s intervention to allow transpersons to apply for the Kolkata Police officers’ examinations, since the online application portal only had two options — male and female. Justice Arindam Mukherjee had urged state counsel Sutapa Sanyal to inform it on the state’s stand. “After the HC’s intervention, I had discussed this with the appropriate authorities. The Bengal government has allowed transpersons to appear for the Kolkata Police officers’ examinations in 2021. I would like to thank the Calcutta High Court and the Bengal government for taking this decision. I think this will have a nationwide impact,” said Sanyal. After Chhattisgarh Police allowed this in March, Odisha and Rajasthan have also had recruitment for transpersons in police forces. Justice Mukherjee, in his order, said, “The intervention on behalf of the advocate representing the state and the prompt decision taken in the matter by the state is appreciated.” The examinations will be for Sub-Inspector/Sub-Inspectress (Unarmed Branch) and Sergeant in Kolkata Police for the year 2021. Unarmed Branch refers to all Kolkata cops who can investigate cases, unlike their counterparts in Kolkata Armed Police, who are deployed for law-and-order duties. The Apex court’s NALSA judgment has recognized individuals who didn’t fall in the gender binary of male and female as third gender. The court not only recognized their fundamental rights, but urged the Centre and state to include them in the other socially backward classes list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-police-can-now-recruit-transpersons/articleshow/86691728.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The civic body held a meeting with officials from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and representatives of Ganesh and Navratri mandals on Friday, to ensure that all follow the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “The plan has already been initiated to implement the revised guidelines of the CPCB for immersion from next year’s Ganeshotsav. This includes separate guidelines for sculptors and artisans, Ganeshotsav mandals and Urban Local Bodies. It also includes separate instructions on idol immersion, as well as guidelines for state-level pollution control boards. All these suggestions were communicated to the stakeholders,” a senior BMC official said. Some of the key recommendations include that idols should be made from only natural, biodegradable and eco-friendly materials. Plaster of Paris (PoP) sculptures have been banned as per the directions of the high court and the instructions of the CPCB.  “Sculptors must be registered with local bodies. They need to make eco-friendly sculptures. If the idol is found not to be environmentally friendly, the deposit will be confiscated and the registration will be cancelled for two years. Immersion of idols at home level is a priority,” an official explained. They further said, “ In this connection, the members of the sculptors’ association said that it takes more time and space to make eco-friendly clay sculptures. They have asked that the BMC provide a mandap for more space and for a longer period of time.” When decorating as well, the official emphasised on the use of leaves and flowers. “Single-use plastic is strictly prohibited. The colours used for painting idols, as well as for decoration, should be environment-friendly,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-pushes-for-ganesh-festivities-sans-pop-single-use-plastic-in-2022/articleshow/86695611.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata airport waits for a Pied Piper to free terminal of cats and rats||KOLKATA: The city airport authorities are seeking professional cat and mouse catchers to get the terminal free of rodents and felines after a portion of the false ceiling and accompanying aluminium cladding fell off last Tuesday, startling an airline crew and narrowly missing a flyer. The aluminium cladding that fell beside the entrance to a toilet in the departure terminal had also brought down a cat. An internal inquiry showed the animal was up there because of rats, which brought into focus the problem of rodents at the airport. Airport authorities have decided to hire an NGO to relocate the cats and a government pest control agency to exterminate the rats. A photo taken from Twitter of a cat at the Kolkata airport“The rat infestation has been a problem with the Kolkata airport. We have asked the central warehousing corporation in charge of rodent control and pest control at airports to look into the issue,” said airport director C Pattabhi. An airport official said the rats mostly hide inside the false ceiling, electrical panels, hangars and apron areas. In January last year, a rat on a Dehradun-bound Air India plane from Kolkata had forced the airline to abort the trip at Varanasi, let out passengers and accommodate them in hotels for 24 hours as staffers looked for the rodent. After Tuesday’s incident, Twitter was abuzz with posts on cat sighting inside the terminals. A Twitter user posted a seven-second video of a cat sitting comfortably on a bench in the airport cafeteria. In the last year, multiple Twitter users have posted photographs of different cats roaming inside different parts of the terminal. “I have spotted them quite often, but they are mostly harmless, sitting or quietly walking around,” said Sutirtha Basu, a frequent flyer. “Cats come here in search of rats and leftover food. We have requested an animal welfare NGO to help us catch and relocate them,” said Pattabhi. TOI contacted one of the animal welfare NGOs that had earlier been contacted by the Kolkata airport with a similar plea. “It’s not right to relocate a harmless animal, like a cat or a dog. The airport authorities had earlier requested us to relocate them, but we had told them we can only sterilise the animals. Following this, they didn’t contact us any more,” said Lopamudra Basu, secretary, Pashupati Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) in Dum Dum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-waits-for-a-pied-piper-to-free-terminal-of-cats-and-rats/articleshow/86691758.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The accused—Ch Subramanyam (revenue section office subordinate), Soka Ramesh (Subramanyam’s associate), Ch Murali Krishna, and Kondepudi Jagadish Dhanaraj—were picked up from Rajahmundry central jail. The public prosecutor representing ACB said the custody of the four was essential as more information is required to understand the extent of the scam. So far, Rs 61 lakh has been found to have been misappropriated by the accused through fake medical bills and other fraudulent claims since 2015. ACB sources said they are now trying to find out where the misappropriated funds were used and any other accounts where the money may have been parked. ACB recently raided Murali Krishna’s house in Prakasam district and seized several incriminating documents pertaining to fake medical bills. As per preliminary investigation, irregularities in CMRF started in 2014 when the accused submitted fake bills and applications to siphon off Rs 1.81 crore. ACB officials said they have found 88 documents to be illegal and 35 claims worth Rs 61.6 lakh to be bogus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cmrf-scam-acb-gets-custody-of-four-accused/articleshow/86688898.cms||---

In the month of September, more than 71,000 passengers travelled from Udaipur airport which is the second highest footfall in the corona period.

The petitioner said that through this amendment, the government has tried to give registered recognition to the malpractice of child marriage which is a punishable offence. Apart from this, a petition has also been started on social media against the amendment which has already garnered the support of over 6,000 users. The Rajasthan Legislative Assembly on 17 September passed the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021. In this amendment bill, the government has made provisions for registration of marriage of a girl below 18 years of age and marriage of a boy below 21 years of age in one month. Bharti, who has annulled 43 child marriages and has stopped more than 1,500 child marriages so far, said, “The future consequences of giving registered recognition to child marriages will be quite fatal. To get the government certificate of child marriage, people will come to Rajasthan for a month and will dump their children into child marriages. Due to which Rajasthan, which has been already famous for years for having the highest prevalence of child marriages in the world, will turn into a child marriage hub by this amendment.” In the PIL that the Rajasthan government has also misinterpreted the 15-year-old Supreme Court’s 2006 judgement as a reason for passing the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriage (Amendment) Bill. “Rajasthan Government has also not completely followed the orders of the Supreme Court which were given in judgement”,added Bharti. However, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) had claimed that the proposed law does not encourage child marriages but protects government benefits and legal rights. This was in response to the National Child Commission for Protection of Child Rights’ claim that the proposed amendment legitimises child marriages. The state commission had said that misconceptions were being spread regarding the bill and that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, can only be amended only by the Central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pil-filed-against-amendment-in-marriage-registration-bill/articleshow/86693650.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

The man behind the scene is Birad Rajaram Yajnik, who developed the first Mahatma Gandhi Digital Museum in Hyderabad in 2012 at Bapu Ghat and is the curator for Mahatma Gandhi Digital Museum. “The purpose to set up the museum in Kazakhstan was because it is one of the few countries which has given up its nuclear arsenal. It only goes on to indicate that it is a non-violent country,” said Yajnik. The plan to establish the digital museum in Kazakhstan was decided after the Dr Mir Nasir Ali Khan, the honorary consul of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh approached the Mahatma Gandhi Digital Museum earlier this year in Hyderabad. “It would take about a year to set up the museum following all necessary permissions. We have a photo biography of Mahatma Gandhi which we will be translated in Kazakh language so that the message of peace spreads in that part of the world too,” said Yajnik, adding that a bilingual text in English and Kazakh language will also be explored. The digital museum will have a film on Gandhi, an interactive quiz and other interesting elements that will bring the father of the nation alive on the 65-inch digital screen. There will also be map that describes various journeys that the Mahatma undertook during his life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-based-curator-to-set-up-gandhi-museum-in-kazakhstan/articleshow/86691498.cms||---

In his deposition, Singh stated that majority of the bullet wounds on the bodies of the victims were in an upward to downward trajectory. Pointing to an opinion given by the forensic team to police mentioning that “no point range firing is noted”, the commission’s advocate asked Dr Krupal Singh to tell what was the point range firing. While mentioning that the subject was related to ballistics, Krupal Singh said that point range firing was close contact firing and point range denotes distance between the person who opened fire and the person injured in the firing. Krupal Singh also stated that no tatooing, burning or blackening was observed at the entry wounds and only a thin rim of bruise was noted and from the trajectory of bullets within the body, the type of fire arm or bullets used in the firing cannot be established.

This decision was taken at a meeting chaired by deputy Mormugao collector Dattaraj Dessai in a bid to address tree falls in Vasco town and other parts of Mormugao taluka. The meeting was convened after Goacan petitioned the SDM for action after repeated incidents of trees falling that are causing loss to life and property. While stressing on the need for regular pruning of trees, officials from the various departments and agencies shared their experiences of obtaining clearances for tree cutting, the procedure of issuing showcauses and the challenges faced by them during the recent cyclone Tauktae. The participants also unanimously agreed that the forest department must play a vital role by providing important information on trees such as its history, growth pattern and health. It was also decided that a follow-up meeting should be held by October-end where all departments and agencies will identify their requirements and make specific recommendations which can be placed before the collector and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Goacan coordinator Roland Martins highlighted the need for all agencies to take preventive action to avoid loss of life and property. He elaborated on the need for consumer safety in public places and called for effective team work from all departments and agencies so as to avoid litigation and the resultant need for payment of compensation in cases that may arise in Mormugao taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mormugao-to-prepare-list-of-dangerous-overgrown-trees/articleshow/86693773.cms||Ruvina Khan

Police stations and traffic guards started preparing a plan of action on Friday. “While social distancing might not be possible, given the sheer number of people who might turn up, we will put up barricades at Babughat and Nimtala to maintain discipline. There will be no compromise on wearing masks,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. “We have to divide time slots or redirect people to other ghats if there is excess crowding,”said a joint commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-gear-up-to-tackle-tarpan-crowd-on-mahalaya/articleshow/86691488.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Restored Uttar Pradesh’s pride: CM Yogi Adityanath at BJYM meet||LUCKNOW: Unleashing a veiled attack on the previous SP government, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said, the youth need to understand why they faced an “identity crisis” five years ago, when Uttar Pradesh was wracked by riots and dubbed a blot on India’s growth story. Addressing the concluding session of the working committee of UP unit of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) in Lucknow, Yogi said, UP was in an economic mess despite being blessed with natural resources. “UP had fertile land for bumper crops and water resources to catapult the state on a higher growth trajectory. But this took a back seat,” he said. “We need to identify and accept challenges, find their cause and take necessary remedial measures,” he said, adding the youth have the ability and energy to change UP’s perception. “Earlier, a handful of people dented the state’s image. But the BJP-led government has restored pride and identity of citizens,” he said, claiming many districts witnessed largescale exodus of villagers to other states. “Now, majority of the population has returned,” he said. The CM said, the state became the second biggest economy in the country after the state government expedited developmental projects of the Centre. Yogi exhorted BJYM functionaries to bring young voters closer to BJP, even as other political parties are trying to woo them. He said, functionaries need to aggressively put forth facts before youth on welfare measures of the BJP government. “The energy of the youth is pivotal for nation building,” he said, exhorting BJYM functionaries to remain disciplined while doing the electoral spadework for BJP in run-up to polls. He said, the next six years are going to be crucial for the state, which, he claimed, was poised to become the country’s largest economy. “The state government will have to bring the per capita income at par with national average,” he said. Yogi said, before 2017, when BJP came to power, the state’s per capita income was one-third of national average. “In last 4.5 years, the state government managed to bring it close to requisite level,” he said. The CM said, the state was fast-tracking development projects, including expressways and airports without controversy. He cited the Bhatta Parsaul violence of 2011, following acquisition of land for construction of Yamuna expressway. “Now, farmers are satisfied as they have received compensation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/restored-ups-pride-yogi-at-bjym-meet/articleshow/86695469.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Kolhapur||Most dams in Kolhapur district filled to capacity||KOLHAPUR: With monsoon season coming to an end, dams across Kolhapur district are filled to capacity which is a good sign for both farmers and citizens. As many as 10 dams out of the 14 irrigation projects are 100% full while the rest are filled above 95%. Major dams like Tulashi, Warna, Dudhganga are the ones filled to capacity, while Radhanagari is 98% full. As compared to last year, the dams are filled in excess mainly due to extra rains in their catchment areas. Due to this the irrigation authorities are satisfied with the dam management this season. They claim both the purposes — managing flood and to ensure adequate stock of water at the end of the rainy season — have been met. Unlike last year, this year heay rainfall in July itself led to complete filling of the dams. In 2020, the authorities had to wait till the end of season for the dams to be full. Mahesh Surve, superintendent engineer of Kolhapur Irrigation Circle, said, “Our aim to get the dams filled by October 15 has been met early this time. The rest of the dams too will be filled to their capacity in next one week to 10 days. Now the rivers too have adequate water level to meet with the irrigation needs for some time. We have to ensure adequate water level is maintained in dams by March next year as that time the demand for irrigation as well as drinking increases sharply.” Cultivation of Rabi crops has started in the district which needs water. The sugarcane crop, which has grown mature, also needs heavy irrigation to sustain till the cutting is done. The irrigation department provides water for this through canals and also by storing at intervals in barrages along the rivers. “We also need to cater to the industry needs. We have plans ready to initiate discharge as per the need for various purposes. We have also planned rotations for water supply for irrigation which if strictly followed will help save water and ensure the dams have adequate stock for the next eight months,” Surve said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/most-dams-in-kolhapur-district-filled-to-capacity/articleshow/86689098.cms||---

---||Pune||Two Mumbai firm officials accused of extorting Rs 1.4L over ‘copyright licence’||Pune: Police on Thursday registered a case against the directors, office-bearers and the field officers of two Mumbai-based private firms after two city businessmen accused them of extorting Rs1.37lakh on the pretext of issuing them ‘licences’ under the Copyright Act, 1957, for staging musical performances at marriage ceremonies in a star hotel at Koregaon Park. The alleged extortion took place in August this year. Senior inspector Rajendra Mohite of the Koregaon Park police said, “The two firm officials would get in touch with hotel managements/officials, asking the latter to share information about upcoming marriage events, claiming that they are the competent authority to issue licences under the Copyright Act. If the hotels refused to part with the information, they would threaten to issue notices and impose fine of up to Rs10 lakh for breaching the provisions of the Act. On getting information, they would contact the parties holding marriage events and collect money in the name of issuing licence.” Mohite said, “Religious and marriage ceremonies are specifically exempted from securing any such licence as per provisions under Section 52 (1) (ZA) of the Copyright Act, 1957. The Registrar for Copyright Act has also issued a public notice on August 27, 2019, that no licence is required for holding such events.” The Pune head of one of the two Mumbai firms (names withheld) told TOI, “I am not the right person to answer any queries in this matter.” The licensing officer (head marketing and strategy) of the other firm said, “We have no idea about the FIR. We will speak to our legal department.” Senior inspector Mohite said, “We recently received complaints from two businessmen (names withheld) that the officials of the two firms told them that they would not be allowed to hold marriage events of their near and dear ones if they failed to seek licence under the Copyright Act. The officials extorted Rs1.37 lakh from the businessmen and issued certificates authorising them to hold birthday party, DJ and get together under the Companies Act.” He said, “The businessmen later suspected the veracity of the certificates and realised that they were tricked. As per the Act, the legal firms registered under the Act are required to issue three no objection certificates for issuing various permissions. The incident came to light after a businessman registered an FIR relating to extortion and cheating under sections 384, 385, 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.” Studied matter for a month before registering FIR, says Pune police chief Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Friday said his department would soon organize a meeting of all hotels and banquet halls and sensitize them that no Copyright licence was required for organising musical events at marriage parties hosted by them. “The two businessmen paid varying amounts to the suspects after they were threatened. We studied the case for around a month, verified its contents, examined the provisions of the Copyright Act and registered an FIR after seeking legal opinion. We have appealed to the public to contact the Koregaon Park police if they have similar complaints,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-mumbai-firm-officials-accused-of-extorting-rs-1-4l-over-copyright-licence/articleshow/86691546.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Bareilly||Finally, Jain couple murder accused appears in court||Bareilly: After being slapped with non-bailable warrant (NBW) for evading court appearance, double murder accused Girdhari Lal Sahu, alias Pappu, who is also the husband of Uttarakhand minister Rekha Arya, appeared in court on Friday. Charged with murdering a Jain couple 31 years ago, Sahu, did show up in the courtroom, but not without a stay on the NBW from the Allahabad HC. The case is now listed in the court of ADJ2 as the district judge of Bareilly accepted Sahu’s ‘court transfer’ application. The trial in the case, pending since long, was delayed after the file was stolen from the court’s record room in 2013. Ever since, the court has been working on the completion of the file, which is still under reconstruction. An SP member in 1990, Sahu fraudulently transferred the ownership of a timber merchant family’s property, fearing they might approach court. On June 11, 1990, Sahu and 10 others barged into the house, locked the daughters in a room and allegedly murdered the couple. Police registered an FIR under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 148 (offence committed by members of unlawful assembly in prosecution of common object), 452 (house trespass with intent to hurt), 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC at Kotwali police station. A chargesheet was filed in the court against 11 people and court proceedings started in 1992 but when the court was approaching judgement, the case file was stolen from the record room. Sahu’s counsel Anil Bhatnagar said, “The Allahabad High Court has granted a stay on the arrest warrant till the next date of hearing, which is November 15. The proceedings can start once the reconstruction of the case file is completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/finally-jain-couple-murder-accused-appears-in-court/articleshow/86689122.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Speaking to TOI from Lima over the phone, Patil, a resident of Thane’s Hiranandani Meadows, shared: “I did not think about the other participating competitors and I did not have anything on my mind about winning a medal or bagging a spot. I remained focused only on the game and tried to give it my best and, to my surprise, the hard work paid off when the results were declared. I’m overwhelmed and all credit goes to my parents as well as my coach and the team that supported me all throughout, especially during the testing time of the pandemic.” Rudrankksh, also known as Sai at home, is the elder of two sons of Balasaheb Patil, DCP traffic, Thane city police, and Hemangini Patil, deputy regional transport officer at Vashi. His father said, “It was a challenging task for him as for the past year and half he had been away from international matches due to the pandemic. There were so many constraints for daily training due to the lockdown and related developments since. But being his first international tournament, he gave it his best shot.” His mother monitored his schedule, practice and diet. “We make sure he gives equal time to everything he does, be it practice or studies. He is good at studies as well. His concentration helps even in studies.” Patil missed the gold by a whisker to Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Shaner William of the US by just 0.7 point. The final score of William was 250.7 and Patil’s 250. The teenager was trained at Major Subhash Gawand shooting range in Thane by coach Ajit Patil, who said, “We were confident as he had the ability to crack the top spot. He followed a strict workout and a planned regime, be it team work along with physical training, psychiatric, physiotherapy, dieticians and he did it all side by side with school for his ISC.” The coach said they were confident even though he was up against William, who by comparison had continuous exposure to international matches, including Olympics. “Nevertheless, he made us all proud.”  The teen said, “I look forward to winning all tournaments, hence I will make sure to put in more effort.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/undivided-focus-paid-off-thane-teen-who-bagged-silver-at-intl-rifle-event-in-mumbai/articleshow/86697060.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The rain also brought back to square one the garbage problem of city water channels which were cleaned by Madurai corporation in a week-long drive. Most of them were filled with garbage in the rain. Streets including Masi Streets and four veli streets where the smart city works are under way were flooded. ``Since the paver blocks are dislodged, walking on these roads could have serious consequences,’’ said S Sundar of Simmakkal. Shopkeepers in Masi street say they have been fearing the rain after smart city works started as water entered the shops causing havoc. ``The old city had a better drainage system compared to the modern one which is inefficient despite using a lot of technology,’’ said Pandian, a store keeper. Roads in DRO colony and also Natham Road, where bridge works are under way, got muddy and slushy. Water also stagnated on main roads where medians did not allow the flow, affecting traffic movement. Meanwhile, a week into the cleaning exercise, heavy rain has washed in garbage that people dumped into channels, and blocked the path of water. Pannaiyur, Sottathatti, Kiruthumal Nadhi and Avaniapuram channels wore a sorry sight on Friday after the rain. Kiruthumal Nadhi, once a free flowing river in the city that turned into a sewage channel, also was filled with garbage on Friday morning. Same was the case with most other channels bringing water to the tanks. The place where the channels flow into the Mariamman teppakulam also had garbage, predominantly plastics stagnating while water flowed anbove it . ``They clean it before the rain and it gets filled with garbage after the rain,’’ said A Asokan of Bibikulam, where the channel is a perpetual garbage dump. Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said they were facing difficulties in some channels like Pannaiyur as it is a heavily populated area. There are problems in JCBs having access to the channels. The garbage which gets washed away in such channels gets accumulated near the culverts. ``We have improved the collection mechanism and secondary movement to a reasonable extent. We are working on improving bin quality and maintenance. Once that is also done, we will start enforcing this strictly,’’ he said. Almost all parts of the city as well as rural areas received an average rainfall of over 50 mm. Madurai north received 72.40 mm, airport 49 mm, Tallakulam - 48 mm, and Viraganur - 62 mm. Pullipatti in the district received the highest rainfall of 118.60 mm followed by Idayapatti with 80 mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/heavy-rain-inundates-madurai-roads-restores-garbage-to-cleaned-channels/articleshow/86693679.cms||---

A government spokesperson said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had issued directions to all DMs and senior police officials to be present in their offices to interact with the public and to check whether orders were being followed, surprise calls were made to their office landline numbers on Friday morning, between 9.30 am and 12 pm. Calls were also made from the additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi’s office to SPs of three zones, by DGP Mukul Goyal to SPs of three more zones and ADG (law and order) office to three additional zones. “During the calls, 16 DMs and 14 SPs were found to be missing from their respective offices. The CM is extremely angry at this conduct and has issued show-cause notice to all of them. If they are unable to provide a satisfactory response and explain why they were not in office, then strict action will be initiated against them,” said the spokesperson. After Friday’s experience, the CM has given directions to the CM office, CS office, additional chief secretary (home) and DGP to carry out regular monitoring of the Janata Darshan programme. “Other than the errant officers, all other DMs and police officers have also been warned against taking the Janata Darshan programme lightly. The CM has made it clear that more such surprise checking will be done and strict action will be taken against anyone who is not present in office,” said the spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/16-dms-14-sps-missing-at-work-during-surprise-call-from-cmo/articleshow/86695503.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Jaipur||Before raising Rs 500 crore in RTDC’s name, govt converts its loan into equity||Jaipur: The state government has converted the loans of about Rs 57 crore given to RTDC into equity as it prepared the ground for raising Rs 500 crore loans for the Tourism Development Fund. According a senior official in the tourism department, the government will raise Rs 500 crore in the name of Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation to fulfill the announcement made in the Budget speech by the chief minister. “The loans have been converted into government equity to make the balance sheet of the corporation clean before the fund raise exercise starts. We are currently in talks with some banks to get the loan in the name of the Corporation to fulfill the announcement made in the Budget,” said Gayatri Rathore, principal secretary, department of tourism. Rathore said that since the corporation was not self-sufficient in generating incomes to run its operations, the state government from time to time used to extend loans. The government has been finding it difficult to lease out the hotels in a short span of time because of the ownership issues of the RTDC’s properties. About 36 properties of the corporations out of the 72 mostly hotels, motels and midways, has been identified by the corporation for leasing out. Many of the properties are making losses, adding to the debt burden of the corporation which once played a critical role in promoting tourism in the state. Over the past decade, the expanding footprint of private hotels, their professional service standards, lower rates and other tourist-friendly services have reduced the advantage the Corporation-run hotels used to have in the past. There are also several hotels which has also been developed by central assistance and the title ownership has been an issue for long-term leasing out or outright sale. As to the tourism development fund, Rs 200 crore out of the Rs 500 crore will be spent for marketing and promotion while Rs 300 crore will be earmarked for infrastructure development. The tourism department is planning to organize a domestic tourism mart next year for selling its destinations. In the past, the department had organized Rajasthan Domestic Travel Mart inviting close to 100 travel and tour operators in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/before-raising-rs-500-crore-in-rtdcs-name-govt-converts-its-loan-into-equity/articleshow/86693677.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said Sidhu’s shenanigans were his desperate attempt to bring the Gandhis to tow his political line. “He is feeling left out as he was not made the chief minister of the state,” said the BJP leader. Congress is crumbling in the country due to the remote control style of functioning and Sidhu did not resign, as claimed by him, for high moral grounds of appointing certain people. “He resigned because Charanjit Singh Channi was made the chief minister and his entire game plan got scuttled,” he added. Refuting the allegations made by opposition parties, including SAD, Sharma said they were unnecessarily making an issue about the delay in paddy procurement dates by 10 days. “There is nothing political in it but procurement has been deferred just because of the increased moisture content in the grain due to the extended monsoon season,” he said. The BJP, on coming to power, will give electricity at reasonable rates and there would be no power cuts, claimed Sharma. The state will be rejuvenated by an economic policy which will take all segments of society together, he added. Farmers’ income will be doubled as always advocated by the BJP, he assured. Sharma also said that his party will improve the health system which is in a shambles and provide quality education to children. He also welcomed some leaders from the SAD and the AAP into the party in Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhus-moral-high-ground-facade-exposed-bjp/articleshow/86693723.cms||---

About 17, 000 have signed the petition, which was addressed to the Telangana government. Varun Rao, who started the petition, said that the Telangana government is putting the health of students and their families at stake by conducting inter first-year exams. The Telangana government is letting a piece of paper decide the health and well-being of more than 4 lakhs students and their families. If the government decides to conduct the offline inter first year exams, they should take complete responsibility for the health of every student and their families,” said Rao. The petition pointed out how many students might have lost a family member during the pandemic and might not be in a mental state to write the exam. If the state can’t cancel the exams, students should be allowed to decide whether or not to appear for these exams. On September 24, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE), which had earlier promoted students of the intermediate first year to the second year without conducting public exams due to the pandemic, announced that the first year inter exam of the 2020-21academic year will be from October 25, 2021. As per the board,70% syllabus will be considered for the exams. “How will we manage second-year studies and competitive exams? We cannot study the first-year syllabus in the second year,” said Siddharth L, an inter student, who signed the petition.Many of them pointed out that many colleges have not completed the syllabus of the first year as physical classes have been held hardly for a month. Some pointed out that they don’t have textbooks or materials to prepare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-students-sign-petition-against-first-year-exams/articleshow/86691541.cms||---

But until the other states start witnessing zero cases per day and zero deaths, we can’t be complacent," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/no-deaths-but-people-must-adhere-to-covid-protocol/articleshow/86702132.cms||---

He appeared two days after the Rajasthan high court while granting an interim stay on his arrest for seven days had asked him to appear before the investigating officer. He accompanied his lawyer but the investigating officer (IO) asked him to come separately to answer questions related to the case. “He was with the IO for more than two hours. He was asked to explain how come his office was used for discussing the release of the outstanding payment of BVG in which kickbacks were also discussed. Also, we asked if this was the first meeting of Rajaram Gurjar the husband of the then Jaipur Mayor Somya Gujjar with the representatives of BVG company or they had visited the office earlier too,” said BL Soni, DG, ACB. Soni wished not to give more details on the interrogation. ACB officials said that if need be, they might ask Nimbaram to appear again before the IO for the investigation. The ACB had started a probe against Rajaram Gurjar and BVG India Ltd after a video of the former negotiating a commission of Rs 20 crore for releasing outstanding dues of nearly Rs 276 crore to the company by JMC surfaced. In the video, Rajaram is seen negotiating a deal with the company employee who is seen agreeing to pay Rs 20 crore as commission. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rss-leader-nimbaram-appears-before-acb-in-corruption-case/articleshow/86693729.cms||---

---||Goa||Six lakes declared official wetlands||Panaji: Goa has got its first official wetlands, with the state government notifying six under the 2017 central government wetlands (conservation and management) rules. The state wetlands are Xeldem lake and Nanda lake in Quepem, Toyyar lake in Chimbel, Dashi lake in Revora, Sarzora lake in Chinchinim, and Cottambi lake. The move is set to prove a boon for a state, which attracts bird watchers from across the country and the world, mainly to the wetlands, to document the endemic and the migratory species diversity found there. The Goa state wetland authority, under the state environment ministry, has been working since the central rules came into being, to declare some of Goa’s important water bodies as wetlands. Bondvoll lake in Santa Cruz village came very close to being the state’s first wetland, but the process dragged on longer than expected, with more area later identified to be added as part of the proposed wetland. Environment minister Nilesh Cabral, to set an example and douse any opposition to wetlands in the state, saw that two of the six first wetlands notified in Goa were within his constituency area. Water Bodies are declared wetlands when they are considered to be critically significant for its ‘ecosystem services and biodiversity values for the local communities and society at large’. Once an area is declared a wetland, any polluting or encroachment activities that are detrimental to this ecosystem are prohibited in the area, including setting up or expansion of any industry, disposal or handling of any construction waste, solid waste dumping, discharge of untreated wastes, among others. Encroachment or any construction of a permanent nature except for boat jetties will also be disallowed from notified wetland areas. However, any traditional fishing activities in the wetlands will be allowed to continue and water from the wetland will be pumped for the use of locals, if required. Planting of any indigenous trees will also be permitted, provided they are suitable to the ecosystem. Thirty-five major water bodies have been identified in the state in all — with the help of the National Institute of Oceanography — which can qualify to be declared as wetlands. Apart from the six waterbodies now notified as wetlands, at least 14 others in Goa are in the final stages of being declared as wetlands. These include Bondvoll lake, Saulem lake in Pilerne, Parra lake, Banastarim lake, Vodle tollem and Dhakte tollem in Benaulim, Sapu tollem in Velim and Maimollem lake in Mormugao, and Curca lake and Canturlim, Malebhat and Gawali-Moula waterbodies in Curca.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/six-lakes-declared-official-wetlands/articleshow/86693718.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The managements said that the government should extend the validity of the documents at least until December 30, 2021. “Why can’t our government react before the deadline? Until today, we were hoping that we are going to get an extension and the majority of the managements have not got their documents renewed. There is no way we can get documents of about 20, 000 school buses in the state in the next couple of days,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association. The managements said that following in the footsteps of the Delhi government, Telangana too should extend the validity of documents. They claimed that each management has to spend about Rs 40, 000 to Rs 50, 000 on each bus to pay pending dues and get them repaired. Despite schools resuming physical classes from September 1,most of the schools have not started operating school buses yet. In the first week of September, the members of TRSMA met T Harish Rao, minister of finance Telangana, and requested for road tax waiver and to extend the validity of motor vehicle documents until December 30 citing financial constraints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/extend-vehicle-docs-validity-till-dec-30/articleshow/86691576.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Meanwhile, Rajasthan Berozgar Ekikrat Mahasangh has also announced a state-wide protest against the paper leak on October 5. Protesters claimed that REET paper was leaked with the help of government machinery and they are demanding resignation of education minister Govind Singh Dotasra and organization of another REET exam. Candidates have alleged that the future of lakhs of unemployed youth in state has been put on stake due to cheating cases. Government has refused to accept this as paper leak. Kirori Lal Meena, while talking to TOI, said, "There is some form of leniency shown by the state government due to which the paper was leaked. They claim to have so much security but their own police officers were involved in cheating. Not just Dotasra, even CM Ashok Gehlot is answerable to the students/candidates who are sitting here." Kirori Lal Meena claimed that the students were lathicharged on Thursday. Meena said that he was called by distressed students to be a part of the protest and he will take the first bullet if needed on behalf of the students until their demand is fulfilled. "We will sit on this protest indefinitely until our demand is fulfilled for re-organization of examination and resignation of the minister." Supporters of Congress took out a rally around the Shaheed Smarak chanting slogans in support of the party. There were verbal clashes in between the protesters and Congress supporters. Both sides were chanting slogans against each other. A delegation of students met the chief secretary of the state as well.

The victim on Thursday approached Satara city police to file a complaint. The case was transferred to Chinchwad police as the complainant was at his rented accommodation in this area on September 28, when the incident took place. An officer from Chinchwad police said the victim works at a private company in the twin towns. “On Tuesday this week, his mobile banking app was not working, so he called a customer care number he found online. The person he spoke to told him to download an Anydesk app on his cellphone, which such scamsters often misuse to get access to a target’s device.” Soon, the complainant opened the bank app and entered an OTP he had received. “The fraudster told him he could access the app again in some time. But when the complainant checked his e-wallet for what he thought was Rs 24,000 in his account, he found only Rs 10,” the cop said. As the bank branch is in Satara, the complainant rushed there the next day, only to find that the fraudsters had also obtained a loan of Rs 2.03 lakh based on his two FDs with the bank. In total, he was duped of Rs 2.27 lakh. Prima facie, the probe has revealed that part of the money was transferred to a bank account in Medak district of Telangana, and part to a bank account in New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/32-yr-old-tries-to-update-bank-app-loses-rs-2-3l-to-crook/articleshow/86691564.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Jaipur||Gangster’s wedding became a flashpoint between rivals in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Photographs from a gangster’s wedding in March last year set off a chain of bitter rivalries and reprisals between the city’s different gangs that culminated in the brutal killing of history-sheeter Ajay Yadav (42) in Bani Park area 10 days ago, said city police on Friday following the arrest of two accused in the murder case. Additional commissioner of police, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba said that city police had constituted special teams that finally arrested Jai Raj Singh and Praveen Kumar Yadav (30) for their alleged involvement in the murder conspiracy. DCP (West) Richa Tomar said that gangster Pradeep Yadav is the prime accused in the case and it was he who organised the hit on Ajay Yadav. “Ajay’s aides had attacked Pradeep who was left paralytic,” she said. According to Additional DCP (West) Ram Singh, Ajay had a partner named Mukesh Yadav. Their relationship soured in 2015 when Ajay Yadav was on the run after he was booked in attacking gangster Gangan Pandit. Mukesh Yadav refused to help Ajay, leading to both paring their ways. “Around the same time, Mukesh forged an alliance with Jhotwara’s notorious history-sheeter Pradeep Yadav. Simmering tensions continued between Ajay and Pradeep-Mukesh gangs,” Singh said. But the major flashpoint became came during the wedding of gangster Manish Saini’s wedding in February last year. Both Mukesh and Pradeep attended the wedding with their underlings and together they uploaded a series of photographs from the venue as a show of strength and a message to Ajay. Police said that Manish Saini was once a close aide of Ajay, “When Ajay saw photos of his rivals at Saini’s wedding, he became furious and gave Saini a dressing down,” an official said. Three days later after the wedding, Ajay’s close aides Himanshu Jangid and Bunty Sharma barged into Pradeep’s office in fired at him, leaving Pradeep severely wounded. “Since then, Pradeep is paralytic and bed-ridden. Both Ajay and Pradeep now became bitter rivals,” Singh said. Pradeep plotted an attack on Ajay and asked his friend Mukesh to eliminate Ajay. on September 21, goons shot at Ajay and smashed his head with a stone. Police have identified the perpetrators as Pradeep, Mukesh, Virendra Singh, Akshay Singh, Jai Raj Singh, Akshay Singh, Praveen and one other unidentified person. Police said that a team including constables Dinesh Sharma and Lal Singh were also part of the team. Police said that Jai and Praveen helped in the conspiracy but shooters have yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gangsters-wedding-became-a-flashpoint-between-rivals/articleshow/86693756.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune civic body redesigns model footpath on Pashan-Sus road||PUNE: The civic body has started redesigning a 500-metre stretch of the Pashan-Sus road footpath as a model pavement. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) move comes in the wake of the flak it received for redesigning footpaths on J M Road, Gopal Krishna Gokhale Road and Aundh road from Parihar Chowk with many people complaining of the reduced carriageway along the thoroughfares. The PMC had invited applications for the redevelopment of the Pashan-Sus road footpath stretch and received 20 plans. It shortlisted three plans and decided to incorporate the positive aspects from the footpaths on J M Road, Gopal Krishna Gokhale Road and Aundh road. “We found that only 7 metre of the carriageway is used by vehicles and the rest is used for parking. We organised a two-day event on July 31 and August 1. The event included art competitions, making bicycles for children, yoga and discussions. We explained to the residents about the project and how the redesigning will not affect traffic flow,” said Dinkar Gojare, executive engineer of the PMC’s road department. Gojare said the carriageway would be 9 metre on both sides, while the footpath built with permeable paver blocks would be 2-2.5 metre. “We will build five zones. The first zone will be a small amphitheatre that can accommodate 20 people. There will be an open gym equipment, skating zone, children’s play area and an art plaza near Abhinav Kala Mahavidyalaya. The drip irrigation method will be used for road surfacing with a mixture of shredded plastic,” he said. The redesigning of the 500-metre stretch is budgeted at Rs1.5 crore and is expected to be completed in six months. The PMC plans to stretch it to the entire length of the road at Rs78 crore. “The footpath will be a precedent for future constructions,” Gojare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-redesigns-model-footpath-on-pashan-sus-road/articleshow/86691586.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi: Light & sound to make a difference to scrap monuments||NEW DELHI: It may well be a heap of bicycle and automobile scrap in essence, but Bharat Darshan Park makes for an enchanting experience. What is more, it is an oasis of calm, its noise barriers and four rows of greenery keeping the city din at bay. The soothing music and the synchronised changing of fluorescent hues are bonuses. The mega park at Punjabi Bagh, which houses 21 famous Indian monuments recreated out of scrap metal, is getting its finishing look, with the majority of the construction work completed. The 8.5-acre leisure spot is likely to be inaugurated on October 31. When the sun sets, Bharat Darshan Park becomes a shimmering spectacle, blue, magenta, orange, green and 200 other hues illuminating some of the most popular examples of Indian heritage. Among them are Mysore Palace, Charminar, Khajuraho temples, Gateway of India, Konark Temple, Nalanda ruins, Meenakshi Temple, Hawa Mahal, Hampi ruins, Victoria Memorial, Sanchi Stupa, Gol Gumbaz, Ajanta and Ellora Caves and the Junagarh Fort. The replicas of Char Dham — Jagannath Puri, Rameshwaram, Badrinath and Dwarka Puri — were recently added. The electrical and horticulture department of South Delhi Municipal Corporation is striving to ‘make a difference’ by making the spot a different experience from the others of the sort in Delhi. A dense plantation not only obscures the spot from the busy road, but also filters out the sound pollution. Soothing music near each replica and fountains add to the relaxed atmosphere. Colourful glass, such as the pieces of discarded green bottles used for the windows of Mysore Palace, for a sparkling effect at night when the place is illuminated. When TOI visited the park, the lighting work had been completed at 12 of the monuments. “Unlike the Waste to Wonder Park at Sarai Kale Khan, where static lights have been used, here we have put up dynamic illumination. They have multiple colours and change regularly, highlighting the delicate artwork involved in the recreations from scrap metal,” said an SDMC official. “For example, for the Khajuraho site,” the official continued, “we are using a combination of blood red and light golden to highlight the figures on the surface. For the Konark Temple, we have a combination of sharp blue and green and at Taj Mahal, light yellow shines for a longer time than other colours.”  The central dome of Victoria Memorial is lit with dark yellow light while the figure of the Angel of Victory atop it shines in multiple shades. SDMC will install three 6 ft by 6 ft screens to display the history of each structure at the food court and other areas. Over 60% of the energy used to power the complex will be solar generated, to be later extended to 100%. “We have five solar trees, each of 5-kilowatt capacity and a generation plant of 84-kilowatt capacity,” the official revealed. “In comparison, Waste to Wonder Park meets just 25% of its power needs through solar energy.” The official also said that each replica would offer ample sitting space. There is a provision for a food court and two toilet complexes.  “The extended monsoon might have delayed the completion of civil and electrical work, but the rains have helped in the rapid growth of saplings and trees planted in large numbers,” said a horticulture department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/light-sound-to-make-a-difference-to-scrap-monuments/articleshow/86717286.cms||Vibha Sharma

The union members were protesting at Amb Sahib Gurdwara against the state government for discriminating against them over the last four and a half years, when SAD president Sukhbir Badal visited the dharna site and expressed solidarity with them. Anganwadi Workers Union president Hargobind Kaur said former chief minister Amarinder Singh had refused to meet them for over four years and even now the Congress government was not doing anything to address their concerns. “The government has not even allowed setting up of tents at the dharna site due to which we have to face extreme weather conditions,” she added. Sukhbir said when his party was in power in the state, they had always addressed the grievances of anganwadi workers. “Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal always kept his doors open for talks with them as well as other employee unions. It is unfortunate that during the present government anganwadi workers were lathicharged and false cases registered against them,” he said. Promising to resolve their issues at the earliest once SAD forms the government in the state, Sukhbir said, “I agree that the honorarium being given to anganwadi workers is very less and needs to be revised appropriately.” He also lauded the role of anganwadi workers during the Covid pandemic, saying they had worked as Covid warriors but did not get the required recognition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-support-sad-in-assembly-polls-anganwadi-workers/articleshow/86693757.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand govt moves HC seeking removal of cap on Char Dham pilgrims||NAINITAL: Days after the Uttarakhand high court (HC) vacated its stay and allowed resumption of the Char Dham Yatra, state government again approached the court, seeking the removal of limit on the number of pilgrims allowed to visit the shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. In a modification application, filed by secretary tourism Dilip Jawalkar, the government has argued that if the limit cannot be done away with, the number of people allowed to visit the shrines daily should be increased to 3,000 each for Badrinath and Kedarnath, 1,000 for Yamunotri and 700 for Gangotri. Interestingly, the government itself had proposed these numbers to the HC while seeking vacation of the stay. The government had then said it would limit the daily number of pilgrims visiting Kedarnath to 800, Yamunotri to 600 and Gangotri to 800. The government had then suggested 1,200 should be let into Badrinath but the court brought it down to 1,000. However, it has now argued that the yatra has been managed smoothly since the shrines were allowed to open for pilgrims and no Covid case has been reported so far. The affidavit added that the government also received a proposal from Char Dham Devasthanam Board for increasing the number of pilgrims as well. "The court has also been informed that the pilgrimage will come to an end between November 15 and 18, which means locals are left with 45 days or so to manage their earnings. It is in their interest that the limit should be removed,” said an official. The affidavit also cited pilgrim numbers at shrines like Somnath, Tirupati and Vaishno Devi, adding that since the Covid situation was far better and that a large number of people had been vaccinated, "it is in the interest of justice and equity" that the previous order of the court be modified, removing the limit on number of pilgrims. The matter was mentioned by the government's chief standing counsel, CS Rawat, before the division bench of Justices Manoj Kumar Tiwari and Alok Kumar Verma on Friday. However, the bench asked Rawat to mention the plea before the bench headed by Chief Justice RS Chauhan. "Since the Chief Justice's bench did not sit on Friday, it was mentioned before Justice Tiwari and Justice Verma. We hope the Chief Justice's bench will sit on Monday and we are able to raise the issue before him, seeking an early hearing," said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-moves-hc-seeking-removal-of-cap-on-char-dham-pilgrims/articleshow/86689141.cms||Prashant Jha

He also asked Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), organisers of the symposium, to help state transport agencies, many of which are in the red due to the rising fuel costs, to shift to more efficient and cheaper alternative sources. “Hydrogen fuel development is very important to mobility. The government has already notified standards for fuel cells and retrofitting, including for long-run vehicles. The cost of retrofitting vehicles is around Rs 10 lakh, which is recoverable within 295 days. ARAI should set up an ecosystem to help state transport agencies with the conversion of their fleets to alternative fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen, bio-CNG, ethanol, and others, as it would result in huge savings,” Gadkari said. He also asked ARAI to work with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) — which are working to develop indigenous clean energy and energy storage solutions — to develop “long-life, low-cost, high-efficiency” EV batteries. Gadkari also emphasized the need to use ethanol in mobility and follow the example of countries such as Brazil, which he said has one of the cleanest energy matrices in the world. “The use of ethanol in vehicles should be encouraged, and we want to introduce flex-fuel engines, which can run on petrol blended with ethanol. It emits significantly less greenhouse gases. ARAI should develop BS-VI or Euro-VI equivalent flex-fuel engines,” Gadkari further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gadkari-bats-for-shift-to-alternative-sources-of-fuel/articleshow/86691594.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Goa||80-100 cases a day probably Goa’s new baseline: Betodkar||Panaji: The state’s daily Covid-19 count between the first and second waves dipped to around 30 fresh cases a day before spiking earlier this year. Over the past few months, while daily infections have dropped below 150, the daily count has been hovering around the 80-100 mark. “This could probably be the new baseline, and we will watch it for a few more months. We will have to wait for new guidelines from the central agencies as well as the WHO,” said state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar. “In any epidemic, a plateau is reached when cases drop. While in a small set-up such as a village, even after an outbreak, cases will touch zero, but it is not the same when it comes to a pandemic, the plateau will remain for a longer time,” he said. The state’s case positivity rate has been around 2% on most days for more than a month. As on Friday, the cumulative tally of Covid-19 cases is 1,76,515. While the lowest daily count last month was 29 on September 11, the drop in infections can be attributed to the beginning of the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. On September 12, as many as 38 cases were reported, but the infections did not plateau at that low level. After that superficial drop, the marginal rise was evident with cases between 80 and 100 reported daily. While most centres are seeing fewer than 50 active cases, a few towns have been witnessing on-and-off flare-ups. The urban health centre of Margao, with its huge jurisdiction, has continuously seen a rise in cases, with its caseload over 100. While the Panaji urban health centre reports one to five fresh infections a day, its caseload has remained below 80 over the past month. Betodkar said that such trends will continue to be seen, and no fresh outbreaks have been reported in any parts of the state recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/80-100-cases-a-day-probably-goas-new-baseline-betodkar/articleshow/86693790.cms||Bindiya Chari

The man was arrested after a seven-hour chase on Friday.  A nine-member crime branch team of Faridabad police was in Haridwar on Thursday to arrest accused in a robbery case. According to police, on September 28, three armed men had allegedly looted a shop in Munjesar police station area of Faridabad. The case was being investigated by crime unit 30 of Faridabad police. During investigation, a police team managed to trace the location of the accused in Haridwar. Once in Haridwar, the team managed to detain four accused at a car parking near Har-ki-Pauri. They were waiting to nab the fifth accused who was scheduled to meet his accomplices there. Four of the accused — identified as Amit, Manish, Abhishek and Anshu — hail from Meetha village in UP’s Ballia district.  According to Haridwar circle officer (CO) Abhay Singh, “Two accused, including Anshu, were being questioned in a car in which they had been apprehended. Anshu managed to whip out a pistol he had hidden under the car seat and shot constable Sandeep Kumar in the head. The team fired in retaliation and the accused was shot in the hand, but he managed to escape.”  The 37-year-old constable was taken to the district hospital and then referred to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. Meanwhile, police launched a search operation to nab Anshu.

---||Goa||Goa cabinet ignored Parrikar amendment to fill top post in colleges||PANAJI: A BJP government-led by Manohar Parrikar had amended the rules to recruit professionals in case of non-availability of suitable candidates without the knowledge of Konkani.  Despite this, the state cabinet on Thursday rejected the Goa Public Service Commission’s recommendation to appoint candidates without the knowledge of Konkani as principals of two professional colleges. As a result, the Goa College of Art and the Goa College of Architecture, both in Panaji, will continue to have to function without a full-time head. Sources said that Parrikar had taken the decision so that a suitable candidate may be recruited in case there is no eligible Goan candidate and to ensure that the functioning of the institute is not affected. Sources said that it is for the first time in the GPSC history that the state government has rejected its recommendation. “In the last 33 years, the government has not rejected any recommendation of the GPSC,” sources said. “In case of non-availability of suitable candidates with knowledge of Konkani for the posts in professional colleges, consultants in directorate of health services and highly technical and scientific posts, the GPSC may recommend a candidate if otherwise found fit and this requirement can be relaxed by the government, on the recommendation of the Goa Public Service Commission, if the government is of the opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do,” then additional secretary (personnel) Yetindra Maralkar had said in the notification. The post of principal for Goa College of Architecture has been vacant since 1997 following the demise of the then principal. Thereafter, a senior faculty from IIT-Mumbai was deputed to the institute as principal in-charge till he was relieved. Since then, different officers have been appointed to the post. Presently, one of the professors at the college has been holding charge as principal on an officiating basis since August 2010. The post of principal of Goa College of Art is vacant since the superannuation of its principal in November 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-cabinet-ignored-parrikar-amendment-to-fill-top-post-in-colleges/articleshow/86693760.cms||Murari Shetye

The message stated that the Supreme Court of India has approved a special logo for teachers to put on their vehicles, much like doctors and lawyers. However, when scrutinised by the panel of experts with the TOI’s Times Verified initiative, the message was found to be fake. In fact, the Press Information Bureau, through its fact check twitter handle, clarified as early as September 15 that the message was ffake. The clarification issued by PIB had read, “A post claiming that the Supreme Court has approved a logo for teachers to put on their vehicles is in circulation. This claim is fake. No such directive has been issued by the Supreme Court.” The twitter handle further cautioned the general public against forwarding such pieces. “The biggest disservice people can do the society and the nation is by forwarding such messages to their contacts, thus, aiding disinformation and fake news,” an expert associated with the Times Verified initiative said. Times Verified was launched early this year with an intention to arm public with the truth and stop the spread of fake news. It initially centred around viral news on Covid-19 and lockdown, before being opened for all viral news making the round on social media in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-logo-has-been-approved-for-teachers-in-the-country/articleshow/86691645.cms||---

---||Pune||50% drop in deaths on train tracks since March last year in Pune railway division||PUNE: A drop in the number of trains operating since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 has had one positive side-effect — the annual number of deaths on train tracks in Pune railway division has more than halved. As per data released by the Government Railway Police (GRP), the Pune division registered 250 deaths on railway tracks in 2020 and 205 till August this year. In comparison, there were 519 deaths throughout 2019. The Pune railway division comprises Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts. “The deaths were mostly on account of people either falling out of or jumping in front of moving trains, or accidentally coming under them. In many cases, the bodies are so damaged that it becomes difficult to identify the deceased,” Kavita Nerkar, additional superintendent (GRP), said. A senior Central Railway official attributed the decrease in the number of deaths — in 2020 and so far in 2021 — to the lockdown restrictions and a consequent drop in the number of trains in operation. About 200 trains would run from Pune station in pre-pandemic times, the official said, adding, “Right now, about 100 trains ply from Pune station.” Nerkar explained that people would sometimes sit in the doorway of coaches and fall off by accident. She further said instances of people ending their lives by jumping in front of speeding trains was high in Pune when compared to other districts. “In such cases, we record statements of the motormen to ascertain how the suicide or accident had taken place,” she said. “In rural parts, many people walk across railway tracks to reach their destinations and get hit by trains. Such accidents reduced in the past two years,” Nerkar added. She said identification bodies is a major problem as in many cases, the bodies are badly mangled. “Many victims do not carry ID cards or cellphones with them. We keep the remains in mortuaries for three days just in case their relatives approach the police, but rarely does this happen,” Nerkar explained. She said police also store the belongings of the deceased at the police station. “We also circulate photographs (if any) and other details of the deceased with other police units in the state to ascertain their identities,” Nerkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-drop-in-deaths-on-train-tracks-since-march-last-year/articleshow/86691651.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Goa||‘NCRB statistics on Goa’s domestic violence incorrect’||Panaji: The Goa Network on Gender Justice (GNOGJ) has alleged that the latest data by national crime records bureau (NCRB) on domestic violence cases for five years from 2015 to 2019, which shows zero cases recorded, is erroneous. It has decided to take up the issue with chief minister Pramod Sawant. “There are several cases of domestic violence recorded by both government and non-government organisations. The cases have been referred to block development officers who are protection officers and have to file the cases in the court under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act 2005,” the GNOGJ stated. Women’s activist Sabina Martins said that grassroot organisations have weekly cases of domestic violence and that one stop crisis centres in Goa have reported thousands of cases in this period. “National Commission for Women has also gone on record that there has been an increase in cases of domestic violence during lockdown,” she said, adding that failure to record crimes against women means “there is no acknowledgement of domestic violence cases and other crimes and hence no affirmative action takes place to stop the violence”. GNOGJ has therefore demanded that independent protection officers be appointed, provided with requisite infrastructure and personnel and adequate budget to function. In the interim, they have demanded a meeting of protection officers, state legal authorities, department of women and child and organisations working on the issue. They have also demanded that a meeting with service providers including State Commission for Women, State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, one stop crisis centre, victim assistance unit and other organisations involved in providing services like socio legal counselling, shelter, helping in providing education and skills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ncrb-statistics-on-goas-domestic-violence-incorrect/articleshow/86693907.cms||---

Police officials told TOI that the role of the staff posted at examination centres have not been ruled out yet. However, the mystery over how the accused came to receive the REET question paper remains unanswered. Soon after Sunday’s REET, Sawai Madhopur police had arrested one Yaduveer Singh, a head constable, his wife Seema Gujjar, Devendra Singh, another constable and his wife Laxmi Gujjar, Ashish Meena, Usha Meena, Manisha Meena and Dilkhush Meena. Police later arrested Sanjay Meena (25) who had allegedly provided the question paper and shared it with others. “We had arrested nine persons who were the first beneficiaries of REET cheating paper. Once Batti Lal Meena is arrested, we will get to know if there were other people involved in the case,” an official said. The police claimed that they had put intensive surveillance against the suspects before the REET which led to several arrests across the state including that of dummy candidates. However, the major racket was found to be operating in Sawai Madhopur district where several irregularities came to the fore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/only-prime-accused-can-reveal-how-reet-paper-got-leaked-say-police/articleshow/86693801.cms||---

The bullet ricochetted off the staircase and hit his leg. The incident was reported on Thursday around 10 pm. Victim Pawan Kumar Manjhi’s father, Pramod Kumar, had retired as a Naik in 2009 and since then the family had been residing in Sarsuna. Pawan was first rushed to Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala and then shifted to CNMC Hospital as his condition was critical. The doctors assured on Friday that he was stable. Sarsuna police detained Pramod and is likely to start a suo motu case after his son refused to lodge a complaint against him. According to police, the exarmy man, who stays with his three sons and a daughter-inlaw at the Sonamukhi Road area close to Sarsuna College, has been suffering from depression lately. “Pramod has been suffering from depression and has taken to drinking. He would often shout out at night and disturb his neighbours. On Thursday night, too, he reportedly got intoxicated and someone tried to imitate him outside his house. This might have led to an argument and Pramod rushed into his house and brought out his gun,” said an officer. “Pramod kept pointing the gun towards the main gate and fearing for the worst, his eldest son Pawan tried to pacify him and snatch the gun away. While this episode was on, the loaded gun fell from Promod’s hand. It went off in the impact and a bullet hit Pawan accidentally. His brothers and friends rushed him to the local hospital. Pawan’s statement was later recorded in presence of a doctor. He stated that he had no complaint against anyone. The gun and the empty cartridge were seized,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The family has claimed some local rowdies were creating nuisance outside the main door that got Pramod angry. “They often created a nuisance outside the main entrance. On most days, they would kick the main door and tease Pramod. On Thursday, my father had just finished dinner when these men started creating nuisance. He tried to protest and the gun had accidentally gone off,” said the daughterin-law. The police said they have not received any complaint from the family on similar lines thus far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bullet-hits-son-after-gun-goes-off-during-row-with-para-boys/articleshow/86691695.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Delhi||Govt yet to reply on DJB audit: CAG to HC||New Delhi: The Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) of India has told Delhi High Court that it made “several correspondences” with Delhi government asking for Delhi Jal Board (DJB) balance sheets of 2015 onwards, but was yet to get them. It added that, during the last six years, seven pending accounts of DJB prior to the financial year 2015-16 had been audited by it. The national auditor’s response came on a PIL filed by BJP functionary Harish Khurana alleging that both DJB and CAG had failed to perform the functions laid down under the law, which make it mandatory to maintain financial accounts and conduct an annual audit to ascertain the effective functioning of the state and local bodies. “That there is no negligence on the part of CAG as accounts were not provided for auditing. The office made several correspondences for seeking accounts for audit from Delhi Jal Board and higher authorities of Govt. of NCT of Delhi,” said the affidavit filed by CAG standing counsel Gaurang Kanth. It clarified that, since these accounts were not made available for audit, it could not be accomplished. “On making available the accounts of DJB, the answering respondent undertakes to conclude the audit of Delhi Jal Board as expeditiously as possible,” the reply assured the court, annexing a list of audits done of DJB. The document showed that the annual audit of 2008-09 was conducted in 2016, while the audit for 2011-12 was done last year by CAG. DJB, in its reply, has termed the PIL as one filed with “oblique motives” and underlined that final accounts and balance sheet of the civic body up to the year 2014-15 had been audited by CAG, based on which the final accounts and balance sheet of the year 2015-16 had been prepared. It explained that accounts for 20l5-16 incorporating the inputs from audited accounts of 2014-15 had been revised and finalised. “It is reiterated that DJB is maintaining its accounts in terms of the Delhi Water Board Act and all extant laws, and is making every effort to ensure all final statements and balance sheets are duly prepared and audited in the interests of transparency and compliance with law,” the authority submitted. DJB has also blamed the erstwhile MCD for delay in annual auditing, pointing out that water supply and sewerage need of the city were earlier being handled by Delhi water supply and sewerage department of the civic body. “The accounts for the years 1992-93 to 1997-98 were not drawn up or audited in a timely manner. The accounts were also maintained on a single-entry system of bookkeeping...these accounts were eventually prepared by MCD only in the year 2007” the agency elaborated. The high court is slated to take up the matter this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-yet-to-reply-on-djb-audit-cag-to-hc/articleshow/86717401.cms||Abhinav Garg

The arrested suspects included four men and two women. A police team took the gang into custody after finding their movements suspicious behind Omkareshwar temple. Their questioning revealed that they were planning to commit dacoity. An FIR under Section 399 (Making preparation to commit dacoity) of the IPC was registered against the suspects. Police recovered sharp weapons, cellphones, an autorickshaw and other itmes from them. “Their questioning led to the detection of 10 theft cases of gold bangles and other ornaments from commuters, mostly women, reported from Vishrambaug, Deccan Gymkhana, Dattawadi, Shivajinagar, Bharati Vidyapeeth and Kothrud police stations,” said inspector Shailesh Sankhe of crime branch (unit I). Sankhe said the gang’s modus operandi was that they would identify women wearing ornaments while boarding crowded Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses. “The four men would push passengers stranded behind the commuters, while one of the two women, armed with a sharp cutter, would cut the bangles/chains,” Sankhe said, adding that the gang would then rush out of the vehicle after it halted. “Two suspects — Sheetal Wadekar (29) and Mohan Jadhav (30) — are criminals on police record. We are verifying the criminal antecedents of the other four — Arun Gaikwad (38), Shivraj Wadekar (22), Prashant Thorbole (22) and Bhimabai Vajranthi (45). They will remain in police custody remand till October 4. We are in the process of recovering the stolen loot from them,” Sankhe added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gang-stealing-ornaments-of-commuters-busted/articleshow/86691687.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Turning UP Into A Smart Water State||Water is the elixir of life. But its scarcity, it is feared, could trigger mass wars. Water crisis is deepening each day in the country and states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are already struggling to mitigate it. Seeing the crisis, the Uttar Pradesh government has undertaken several steps to become a water smart state. The Times of India Water Positive campaign, too, is in sync with this initiative. To spread awareness on the issue, the Times Group will also be organising the Times Water Conclave in Varanasi on October 6. The event will bring stakeholders on a common platform to discuss ways to accelerate UP’s progress towards becoming a Water Positive state. Knowledge partner for the event is Water Aid. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will share the state’s vision for water conservation. Here’s a look at some significant steps taken by the state government to replenish the water resource: 1. A dedicated dept to make UP Water Positive State: The UP government was among the first states to respond to PM Narendra Modi’s call to introduce Jal Shakti ministry. Modi launched the Jal Shakti ministry by reorganising the erstwhile ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation. While the ministry was formed in May 2019, UP’s Jal Shakti department came into existence in August 2019. Officials said the step was taken to reap the maximum benefit from the opportunity that came in the form of a double engine government (BJP in power at the Centre and UP) and to achieve better coordination between the two governments. 2. Illegal extraction of groundwater made a punishable offence: Realising the need to check groundwater exploitation and that protection, conservation and regulation of the water resource was necessary for sustainable management of groundwater, both qualitatively and quantitatively, especially in stressed rural and urban areas, the UP government brought the UP Groundwater Management and Regulation Act in 2019. It proposes seven-year jail for commercial, industrial, infrastructural and bulk users of the groundwater who did not handle water resources responsibly. 3. Strengthening policy framework: Working on any issue is not possible with policy contours. The state government formed a body of experts to review the State Water Policy of 1999 and come up with an improved version. The three goals set in the new policy are: make UP climate resilient and sustainable; right balance among water for people, food, green growth and other uses; and water security, ensuring access to safe, adequate, affordable, water for all. Experts say since the new policy embodies a ‘desirable and aspirational future’ approach, it can address present-day challenges by setting a roadmap. The policy awaits official notification. 4. Smart planning and prioritisation: Displaying long term vision, the state government rolled out a prioritisation plan when it came to providing clean drinking water to rural homes. Under this, the government picked up the parched Bundelkhand and rocky Vindhya districts first. In the subsequent phases, the state picked up AES and JE affected districts before heading to fluoride and arsenic affected districts. The plan also includes addressing problems like high iron and total dissolved solids in water in future. 5. Real-time monitoring of water bodies: In sync with the open data policy of the central government, the UP government is keeping a tab on the status of water bodies in the state in real time. This data is available to the public and end user groups such as Krishi Vigyan Kendra and government offices. While, on one hand, the data is used to predict problems like drought or flood, it is also being used to keep an eye on speed of implementation of projects in a transparent way. 6. Leveraging solar power to sustain water supply: Previous experience in UP had indicated that schemes often failed because of operation and maintenance issues. It was seen that huge electricity bills were accumulated in running the rural water supply stations while non-payment led to their shutdown eventually. In 66 districts, the rural water supply stations will leverage solar power to function. Also, the companies engaged for the process have been asked to run and maintain the system for 10 years which also guarantees project sustainability. The reduction in carbon footprint is an added advantage. 7. Focus on health of river system: A crucial element of the Namami Gange scheme was to build sewage treatment plants – both large and small – to check river pollution and achieve the quality of water. As a result, the Jajmau Nullah — Asia’s largest drain — which had been polluting the Ganga for years has been tapped. The pollution levels, claim officials, have come down drastically. Similar initiatives to check pollution in the Ganga by saving rivers like Varuna and Assi are also underway. In addition to this, the government has encouraged local administrations to save rivers in their districts. 8. Plan to save wetlands rolled out: Wetlands are the link between land and water. In 2019, the state government notified the UP Wetland Authority under the forest department to champion the cause of saving wetlands – that are a cushion between land and water. According to the National Wetland Atlas, UP is home to 1.2 lakh wetlands with at least 49,000 wetlands that are more than two hectares in area. The authority is now working to prepare a state wetland atlas so that the conservation can be undertaken in an organised way. Since the authority came into existence, six wetlands have been notified under the UN RAMSAR Convention. 9. Promoting precision irrigation in agriculture: Data shows that nearly 85% of the fresh water in UP is used in crop irrigation. Experts say sprinklers and drip irrigation can reduce fresh water consumption by 10%. Precision agriculture is seen as this century’s most valuable innovation in farm management as it promises to reduce input cost and increase returns while saving water. While the state agriculture and horticulture departments are promoting it through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichai Yojana and more crop per drop, specially in the Bundelkhand region, the UP sugarcane development department is promoting the sub-surface drip irrigation technology among cane producers. Sugarcane is a water intensive crop. 10. Ready to adopt water sensitive master plan: Uttar Pradesh is among the first ones to turn the vision of having water sensitive master plans into a reality in the Ganga towns. Several independent agencies have been engaged by Namami Gange to prepare water sensitive urban design and a master plan that promises to ensure that cities’ development does not harm the rivers and their other water bodies in any way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/turning-up-into-a-smart-water-state/articleshow/86695608.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Gadchandur police rushed to the spot and rescued the three people trapped in the mangled ambulance. The deceased comprise truck driver Ranjeet Kondawale (47) and ambulance passengers Laxmikant Teltumbde (23) and Kalyani Teltumbde. Ambulance driver Vinod Yelmjule, pregnant patient Sapna Motghare and one other person were injured. All three injured were rushed to rural hospital in Gadchandur and are learnt to be out of danger. Motghare gave birth to a baby on Friday at the hospital. There is often a long row of cement trucks coming to pick up load from the Ambuja cement factory near Hardona village along the Rajura–Gadchandur-Adilabad highway. Heavy parking on both sides of the highway makes that road stretch a bottleneck, leading to accidents, sources claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-killed-3-injured-in-accident/articleshow/86691672.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Varanasi||Cashier held for syphoning Rs 8 lakh of employer online||Times News Network Varanasi: The cyber crime police station of Varanasi range, on Friday, arrested a cashier for syphoning Rs eight lakh of his employer through internet banking. The IG Varanasi range SK Bhagat said, “The cyber crime police, led by nodal officer cyber crime Abhishek Pandey succeeded in nabbing Saurabh Kumar Singh of Natiniyadai area after proper investigation of the trick adopted by him to syphon money. Apart from a mobile phone and sim used for online transactions of money police have also recovered an ATM card and cash worth Rs 17,900 from him.” Police said that owner of a firm ‘Akela Traders’ and native of Pandeypur Chandramani Jaiswal lodged a complaint alleging that cyber criminals had withdrawn Rs 7,90,450 from the bank account of his firm. Taking note of it the police involved the bank officials to investigate the matter, they said adding that this investigation cleared the involvement of internal staff of the firm in the money syphoning through net banking. After Jaiswal confirmed that Saurabh had the customer ID, password and all other details of his firm, the police started interrogating him. Saurabh tried his best to mislead the police in initial investigation, but he finally confessed that he had joined Jaiswal’s firm near regional transport office on airport road, in December 2020. The firm provides services of depositing registration, fitness, insurance, permit fees to the vehicle owners. As he worked as cashier and had a good knowledge of computer, Jaiswal showed full faith in him and provided his customer ID and password of his bank account for online transactions. Taking advantage of the information, Saurabh started transferring money from Jaiswal’s account to his wallet and bank accounts and also of close ones through free charge app, said police. Of the total syphoned money, Saurabh had spent maximum amount to clear his personal dues, online gaming and personal enjoyment, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cashier-held-for-syphoning-rs-8-lakh-of-employer-online/articleshow/86690867.cms||---

Additional sessions judge SP Pol passed the order stating that the accused 1 to 106, charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code related to rioting, obstructing public officials from carrying out duty and causing damage to public property, have been discharged from the offences. The court gave the ruling on the request from the state government through the public prosecutor to withdraw the cases. The copy of the order, passed by the court and accesed by TOI, states that the application claimsthe role of the accused in the incident is not clear based on the evidence. Also, the government application claimed that the continuation of prosecution against the accused persons would cause disturbance to public peace. Arvind Deshmukh, government prosecutor said, “As per government policy of making accused free from political and social charges, the application for withdrawal of prosecution has been taken. They have paid the compensation for the damage caused during the incident to the public property.” Bilkis Shaikh Bujruk, defence lawyer, said, “The role of the accused cannot be established. The court considered the application based on the evidence available. Earlier, some accused have been discharged from the offences on same ground.” Earlier in 2017 when the previous government was in power in the state, the government had moved a similar application, which led to the withdrawal of prosecution of BJP state president Chandrakant Patil, Miraj MLA Suresh Khade and several other prominent leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena. Now, among 106 accused, who have been discharged by the court, are Sena leaders such as Bajarang Patil and Nationalist Congress Party leader Mainuddin Bagwan. Sangli and Miraj cities witnessed riots for over two weeks after a few people attacked a Ganesh pandal. The mandal at Miraj had put up a poster of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj killing Afzhal Khan and the tension was created between two communities. The incident had a major political fallout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sessions-court-discharges-several-sena-ncp-leaders-from-miraj-riot-case/articleshow/86689246.cms||---

Radhika Nayak has been acting as the registrar as a stop-gap arrangement ever since. Last month, GU called for applications for the post of registrar and received 10 applications. Among the applicants are academics from within the university and principals and lecturers from affiliated colleges, according to sources. As the tenure of the registrar is five years, those with five or more years left before attaining the age of 60 will get preference for appointment to the post. “The registrar shall be appointed on the basis of direct recruitment for a tenure of five years, which may be renewed at the end of each of the term of five years, till the age of 60 years,” the Goa University statute states. Those in the know state that the interviews are likely to be held shortly and a full-time registrar will be appointed before the end of this month. Goa University had received a flood of as many as 267 applications earlier this year for the post of the vice-chancellor, and finally a GU dean Harilal B Menon was appointed as the new VC last month. However, the post of registrar received only 10 applications as domicile certificate is a mandatory requirement to apply for the post, unlike for the post of VC, where those based across India could apply. The post of registrar fell vacant in mid-September last year after Reddy resigned with just seven months left for his five-year term to end. The new registrar is chosen based on the recommendation of a selection committee.This committee comprises of four members and is chaired by the vice-chancellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-university-likely-to-appoint-full-time-registrar-by-month-end/articleshow/86693887.cms||---

---||Goa||SAFF Cup: I don’t feel any pressure, says India coach Igor Stimac||Panaji: Foreign coaches have not had it easy in the SAFF Cup. Jiri Pesek (1993) was the first to win the regional tournament, while Stephen Constantine (2015) was the last, though in his second stint as national coach. In-between, the five SAFF Cup titles have been shared by Indian coaches. The defending champions start the tournament in Maldives as overwhelming favourites, but given what has transpired in the past, and the form of the opponents in the present, Igor Stimac’s team cannot take anything for granted. “Just look at what happened on the opening day,” Stimac told reporters during an online interaction on Saturday. “There was one counter-attack by Nepal in their match against Maldives, and they won the game despite Maldives being the better side. Bangladesh won with a disputed penalty (against Sri Lanka). We don’t know what each game will bring to us. We will adapt to everything that is thrown at us.” India will open their SAFF Cup campaign against Bangladesh on Monday. Stimac is eager to show everyone that Indian football is on the right track. Since taking over in May, 2019, India have won just two matches. There have been seven draws and seven defeats. But while the defeats have come against stronger teams like Oman, Qatar, UAE, Curacao, DPR Korea and Tajikistan, it is India’s inability to translate their superiority against considerably weaker opponents into wins that has caused concern. Not surprisingly, Stimac has now been put under some pressure. “I don’t feel any pressure, and I don’t want the players to feel anything because that’s limiting their capacities when the important time comes on the pitch,” said Stimac. “I have brought a full-strength squad here because this is the last chance before the third round (Asian Cup 2023) qualifiers starts for our team to be together. We won’t see each other until February. We will try and use this tournament to check out a few more things, get more experience for the youngsters and try to win the tournament.” India are the highest-ranked side in the SAFF Cup which kicked off on Friday. But recent performances against Bangladesh and Nepal have suggested they won’t have it easy. “With every passing day, we realise that every other team in the SAFF region is also improving,” said captain Sunil Chhetri. “We cannot afford to be 90 percent against anyone. That is one of the biggest learnings that we have learned playing Nepal (in friendlies). Not a single game will be easy for us. We have to fight, and it’s something that none of the players are mistaken about. Until we fight for each and every ball, we won’t get anything.” Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu agreed that the level in SAFF Cup has gone up a few notches. “The level of the competition has become better. Teams are aware of how to exploit an opponent's weakness. We have to respect each and every team, and give our best,” said Sandhu. India won the tournament when last played in 2015. The hosts defeated Afghanistan 2-1 at the Greenfield Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saff-cup-i-dont-feel-any-pressure-says-india-coach-igor-stimac/articleshow/86715358.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

A set of four postcards were also released as the day (October 1) also coincides with World Postcard Day, which will be significant for post-crossing. The goal of this project is to allow anyone to send and receive postcards from all over the world. For each postcard one sends, they will receive one back from a random post-crosser from somewhere in the world. The set of postcards released by Goa Post consists of one on the natural heritage of Goa and two others on the architectural heritage of Goa. “They are real collectors’ items from both a philatelic collectible as well as from a tourist point of view,” the Goa Philatelic and Numismatics Society (GPNS) stated. A special bulletin on the forthcoming GOAPEX 2021 was also released during the occasion. The bulletin consists of three articles – Saint Francis Xavier by GPNS president Ramesh Kumar, ‘Commemorating 150 years of the first stamp in Goa’ by GPNS joint secretary Roland de Melo, and ‘World Postcard Day’ by senior superintendent of posts, Goa postal division, Sudhir Jhakere.

---||Pune||Pune: Belsar village may get ‘Zika free’ tag soon||PUNE: The state health authorities are gearing up to declare Belsar village in Purandar taluka a “Zika free zone”, two months after Maharashtra’s first case was detected there. State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, “There has not been a single additional case of Zika in Belsar and surrounding villages of Purandar taluka in Pune district in the last two months. We shall declare the area a Zika free zone at the end of this month.” According to the norm, an area is declared a Zika free zone after sustained containment efforts result in not a single additional case. Barring the 50-year-old Belsar woman testing positive for the virus on July 30, none of the residents of the village and surrounding areas tested positive for the virus over the last two months. “We shall taper down the stringent vigilance norms currently under way in Purandar taluka by October-end. We can safely declare that we have contained the Zika virus effectively in the area and there is no virus transmission,” Awate said. The mosquito that transmits the Zika virus — Aedes aegypti — also transmits dengue and chikungunya. They are widely seen during the monsoon and post-monsoon period (June to October). The containment measures focused on using larvicides to destroy mosquito-breeding spots and other vector control measures. The surveillance team educated residents about ways of eliminating mosquito-breeding spots and promoted the use of contraceptives among villagers as the virus stays in the semen of the infected men for a long time. Purandar taluka’s health officer Ujjwala Jadhav said, “The Zika virus has been fully contained in Belsar and surrounding villages as there has been no additional case. Hence, we are seeking guidance from the state to declare the region as Zika free zone. We have emphasised using personal protective measures, including mosquito nets and repellents. We are also monitoring the health of pregnant women on a sustained basis.” Global studies have confirmed that women infected with the Zika virus during their early stages of pregnancy are 17 times more likely to have a child with microcephaly (small brain or brain defect).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/belsar-village-may-get-zika-free-tag-soon/articleshow/86691762.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Our two daughters are married and son lives abroad. I leave house around 9am every day and return around 7.30pm. In the afternoon, I or my employee come to take lunch.” Around 3.30pm Thursday, Kumar’s employee Mishri Lal went to his house to pick up his lunchbox. “Minutes after he left, two robbers entered our house as the main door was not locked. As they bolted the main door from inside, my wife saw them. Before she could do anything, they closed the lobby door too. One of the robbers was turbaned and around 40-year-old. He had covered his face with a piece of cloth. The other was around 25-year-old and was not masked,” he added.“At knifepoint, one of them asked my wife not to resist. They tied her hands and mouth with a cloth. The checked all the almirahs and took out Rs 1.50 lakh, gold and diamond jewellery, worth about Rs 25 lakh. Before fleeing, they locked Sapna in a bathroom. As the bathroom was attached with another room, too, Sapna untied herself and came out from there and raised the alarm,” Kumar said. A cop said Mishri Lal had worked with Kumar for over two decades. About two years ago, he left the job and went to his hometown. About four months back, he again started working for Kumar. Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) SPS Dhindsa said, “We suspect the involvement of an acquaintance, who knew when the worker came to get lunch and when the woman was alone at home. The accused have been captured on a CCTV installed near the spot. The footage shows they escaping with cash and jewellery. The case is being probed from all angles.

About 450 families still have certain issues that remain unresolved, of which 70 to 80 families are staying put at their native villages without power and water connections. They claim that many benefits under the rehabilitation scheme have not been passed on to them. These dissenting villagers are, in fact, camping under broken houses, tents or tarpaulin. Most of them are staying in Nagla Shareef Khan and Nagla Ganeshi, with a handful camping in Rohi too. In the absence of electricity, their lives are similar to the ones who stay in refugee camps with bare minimum resources. Hasan Mohammad, 41, from Nagla Shareef Khan is one such villager. He claims that benefits due to his son Nasruddin have not been offered under the RnR scheme. Though an adult member of the displaced families is eligible for Rs 5 lakh and a plot, Nasruddin has not got the money or other benefits. The team constituted to address the grievances of the affected villagers had rejected the claims by dubbing Nasruddin as a minor. Under the RnR scheme and the Land Acquisition Act, benefits can be offered only to adults. To determine the eligibility of adults, authorities kept November 3, 2018, as the cut-off date. Though Nasruddin’s Aadhaar card shows his date of birth as February 5, 2018, he was not found eligible for the RnR scheme. “He was not present in the village during the first two surveys. He is a bit slow and mostly remains indoors under someone’s watch,” said his father. Similarly in his early 40s, Shiv Kumar stayed back in Rohi. “My four sons have not been offered RnR benefits and plots. We submitted all the documents to the team of officials that visited our village in July. Some left out children were included but my sons were shown as outsiders by the team,” he said. Grievances pertaining to RnR scheme benefits of several others from Nagla Shareef Khan, Nagla Ganeshi and Rohi such as Fakruddin, Haseena and Harpal also remain unsolved. When contacted, sub-divisional magistrate of Jewar, Rajni Kant said, “We are going to visit the RnR site on Saturday morning. We will make a list of families having grievances. Though we have already disposed of the grievances in July, issues that appear genuine will be examined again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/80-families-stay-put-in-jewar-villages-over-rehab-demands/articleshow/86695698.cms||Shalabh
---||Ludhiana||Engg body moves NGT, says bylaws ignored||RAINWATER HARVESTING Ludhiana: The Council of Engineers (COE) has filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), alleging gross violation of mandatory provisions of the Punjab Model Building Bylaws for providing rainwater harvesting and recharge wells at public buildings and places as well as private units. The Punjab government (through chief secretary), principal secretary of the local government department and housing and urban affairs, MC, LIT and Glada have been made respondents in this case. Seeking the constitution of a monitoring committee for installation of rainwater harvesting and recharge wells in technical and scientific ways by MC, LIT and Glada, the petitioners submitted a proposal for common rainwater harvesting by making a rooftop network in old buildings. Kapil Arora, COE president, said rainwater harvesting was mandatory for private buildings constructed over 100 square metres and all commercial and industrial buildings. However, officials of all three development authorities, MC, LIT and Glada, have blatantly limited their role and duty to collect refundable security deposits at the time of approval of building plans as they do not verify the compliance of mandatory installations. Another council member Kulwant Singh Rai said groundwater extraction in Punjab has increased from 149% (of naturally available recharge) in 2013 to 165% in 2018. “It is a matter of serious concern because groundwater depletion would affect the flow of rivers and streams, disrupting aquatic ecosystems and global food security. Ludhiana receives an average rainfall of 680mm in a year and with scientific installation of a harvesting system, around 50% water being used for domestic consumption can be recharged,” he said.Singh said besides private buildings, open spaces and recreational land could be used for the purpose, but the system was missing in all office buildings of the MC and the LIT. Another member, Mohit Jain, said thousands of illegal buildings and colonies have come up in Ludhiana where storm-water drainage and rainwater harvesting have not been provided, resulting in waterlogging of roads, which suffer damages, leading to exploitation of resources like aggregates, bitumen and fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/engg-body-moves-ngt-says-bylaws-ignored/articleshow/86689352.cms||---

While Congress also objected to the provision of the government having power to change the name of the village, the BJP supported the clause in the Act through an amendment stating that the original names of the villages, which were changed at various times, need to be restored. Though ministers Errabelli Dayakar and Vemula Prashanth Reddy said that the clause to change the village name was an existing provision in the Act and not a new one, AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and Congress floor leader Bhatti Vikramarka opposed the passage of the bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mim-opposes-panchayat-bill/articleshow/86689376.cms||Roushan Ali

Earlier, representatives from both Congress and NCP had expressed their reservations over the three-member ward system. But the deputy chief minister said it would make no difference. Congress’ city unit chief Ramesh Bagwe said his party was looking forward to one-member ward system, but the MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi)’s decision to go ahead with the three-member panel had been accepted by the party workers without any disgruntlement. “Our party has started with the preparations for the civic polls. The three-member panel will help arrest the rebellion,” Bagwe added. Sanjay More, the head of Shiv Sena’s city unit, said, “Our party follows the instructions of the party chief. Shiv Sena play a key role in deciding the post of mayor in the coming polls,” he said. Jagdish Mulik, the head of BJP’s city unit, said there were differences among the MVA members about the panel system for the civic polls because they lacked confidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deputy-cm-no-differences-in-mva-over-three-member-ward-system/articleshow/86691813.cms||---
---||Noida||From October 4, special drive-through vaccine sites in Noida for 45+ awaiting first jab||NOIDA: The health department will set up special vaccination sites at Spectrum and GIP malls from Monday in an attempt to inoculate those aged over 45 years. Officials said there are nearly 64,000 people in the age group who have not taken a single dose yet. Covishield would be administered at the drive-through sites in Spectrum Mall, Sector 75, and Great India Place (GIP), Sector 38A. While priority will be given to first dose recipients, second doses will also be administered, officials have said. “We have noticed that many people in the 45+ years age group have missed the vaccine doses and they have to be inoculated on priority. Most people in the 18-44 years age group have already taken the jabs. The two special camps would help people get the vaccines without much hassle,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunisation officer. According to data collected during a special surveillance drive conducted from September 7 to 16, about 64,000 people in the district in the 45 years and above category have not yet taken a single dose of the vaccine. Of them, around 22,000 were vaccinated during the mega drive on September 27. There are 5.06 lakh people in the 45+ age group and so far, 4.64 lakh people have been vaccinated.Based on population estimates of the department, 108% population in the 18-44 years age group have taken the first dose of vaccine, 91% in the 45 years and above category have taken the shots. About 9% in the 45 years and above category are yet to get vaccinated. “We are working with projections according to the 2011 census and currently, the population of the district is more than three times that number. There is also a large floating population here. So, there may be many more people who have not been accounted for,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, the chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/from-monday-special-drive-through-vax-sites-for-45-awaiting-1st-jab/articleshow/86695739.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Hyderabad||Central funds to panchayats a constitutional duty: Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday pointed out that central funds released to gram panchayats was a constitutional obligation and not a mercy from the central government. Intervening during question hour in the assembly, the CM said, “There is nothing like central government funding. It is a constitutional obligation that the central government was implementing in releasing funds to states. The finance commission of India decides the funding as part of constitutional obligation. It is the right of the states,” CM KCR said. The CM urged the Congress members not to mislead the people by making claims that employment guarantee scheme (EGS) funds for gram panchayats were being diverted to other sectors. He said that it only revealed Congress members’ lack of knowledge. KCR’s intervention came while panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao was replying to queries by Congress’ Bhatti Vikramarka, D Sridhar Babu and D Anasuya who sought to know whether Rs 15,738 crore funds released under EGS to gram panchayats in Telangana were diverted to other sectors. Dubbing the Congress’ allegation of diversion of funds as baseless, the CM countered, “In fact, the previous Congress governments created an alternate power centre due to which gram panchayats were left powerless. Due to the wrong policies of previous Congress governments, there are Rs 2,000 crore power dues of gram panchayats even today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/central-funds-to-panchayats-a-constitutional-duty-kcr/articleshow/86689338.cms||Roushan Ali
---||India||Sky’s the limit: 100% cutoff for 10 courses in DU colleges this year||NEW DELHI: A high 90s does not guarantee admission to Delhi University. The first list of qualifying marks for admission to undergraduate courses, released on Friday, shows that nothing less than the maximum is required of students who want to pursue 10 courses in different colleges this year. Last year, only three courses had the cutoffs pegged at 100%. BCom (Honours) and economics (H) at Shri Ram College of Commerce are open to first list applicants only if they have aggregated 100%. It is the same for computer science at three colleges: Hansraj, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College. Political science (H) too has a 100% bar at Hindu and Ramjas, the latter also setting the highest benchmark possible for physics (H). The tenth maximum cutoff is at SGTB Khalsa College with 100% for the BCom programme. College principals explained that over 9,200 applicants, or 3% of the total number of those who registered for admission in DU, have an aggregate of 100% in their Class 12 exams, putting a premium on high-demand courses. Also, unlike earlier, the colleges do not have data on how many students opted for a particular subject during registration. Since last year, DU has removed the course selection option in the registration form, allowing students to make their choice only after the announcement of cutoffs. Last year, Lady Shri Ram College hit the headlines with 100% cutoff in economics, political science and psychology (H). The qualifying marks this year are 99.5%, 99.75% and 99.75%, respectively. The number of 100% scorers applying at DU this year is almost 3,700 more than the 5,500 of last year. In addition, the number of students scoring 95% and above in CBSE this year is 70,004, up from 38,686 last year. Manoj Khanna, principal, Ramjas College, said, "The application data provided by DU on Thursday showed that almost 10,000 applicants had a best-of-four aggregate of 100%. We cannot keep the cutoff low and risk over-admission." This has put the qualifying mark between 98.5% and 100% in North Campus colleges for most courses. The increase from last year’s already high cutoffs range this year from 0.25 to 0.75 percentage points. At Miranda House, at top spot in the NIRF ranking of Indian colleges, the highest cutoff is for political science (H) at 99.75%, marginally higher than 2020’s 99%. Explaining the 100% cutoff at SRCC, a teacher said, "The university hasn’t provided us with the full data on applicants. It just said there are 450 students with commerce backgrounds who have scored 100%. With no other filters provided, we had to set the cutoff at 100%." SRCC has 135 seats for economics (H) and 552 for BCom (H), including the supernumerary quota. For its part, SGTB Khalsa reasoned that very few North Campus colleges offered the BCom programme course. "Maths is not compulsory for BCom programme, so many students would be interested. Hansraj and Hindu only offer BCom (H), so we had to be careful," said Jaswinder Singh, principal, Khalsa College. The BCom (H) cutoff is at 99.5%, an increase from 96.75% in 2020. But outside of North Campus, too, the cutoffs are high. At Rajdhani College in west Delhi, the bar for history (H) has jumped to 96% from 90% in 2020. At Vivekananda College in east Delhi, history (H) requires 97%, a sharp rise from 85% last year. Rajdhani principal Rajesh Giri said, "We based our cutoffs on the data on high-scorers and as per our experience in last year's admission trends." Since 2015, the cutoff for computer science has always been at the upper levels. In fact, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies has the eligibility point at 100% for honours in the subject, up from 97% last year. College principal Poonam Verma said, "Analysing the applications, we found that science students eligible for the course in the unreserved category numbered 1,254, in OBC 1,168, in SC 204, in ST 31 and under EWS 86. We presumed 5% of them applying while determining our cutoff." However, Verma added, the real figure of actual applicants will be evident only after the first round of admission is over. She also pointed out that when the students registered for admission in DU, many of them hadn’t received their engineering entrance test results and some will now no longer seek admission in DU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/skys-the-limit-100-cutoff-for-10-courses-in-du-colleges-this-year/articleshow/86697099.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Better pay keeps ad hoc teachers off EWS posts||New Delhi: When Ramjas College held an interview for hiring English lecturers on Thursday, only six candidates were found eligible for the post that was reserved for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category. Ever since EWS reservation was implemented in Delhi University in 2019, colleges have been facing difficulty in filling the vacancies. Despite many ad hoc teachers being there, they are out of the eligibility criteria of Rs 8 lakh income bracket as their annual pay exceeds that amount. “For the post of an English lecturer in a North Campus college, just six being eligible to sit for an interview is very less. The others who came did not have valid certificates and were marked in the unreserved category,” said Debraj Mookerjee, head of the English department at Ramjas. Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and secretary of DU Principals’ Association, said, “It’s a huge problem. At the start of implementing any reservation, filling positions is difficult. When EWS reservation started, many who were eligible didn’t know how to apply or get the certificates. The same problem was seen when OBC reservation was implemented. In the beginning, only a couple of candidates turned up. We were not getting choices. Now, we have started getting candidates for courses like Hindi, commerce, history and political science. But for economics, psychology and English, fewer candidates are available.” The colleges cannot consider ad hoc faculty members as their pay comes to around Rs 90,000 a month due to which they stay out of the EWS category of Rs 8 lakh income bracket. “Ad hoc teachers who work for two years get higher pay, which renders them ineligible for the position. They are out of the system and criteria. The government should create new positions for this category, otherwise experienced teachers will remain out of the criteria,” said SP Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College. Sinha said, “This is a huge anomaly that needs to be addressed by the government. Personal income should not be taken into consideration in the case of ad hoc teachers because they can be out of a job in the next few months. They will miss the criteria eligibility too.” Mookerjee fears that due to non-availability of candidates, the positions might get converted to that of guest faculty members. “It is actually delegitimising a genuine post and making it a guest faculty position,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/better-pay-keeps-ad-hoc-teachers-off-ews-posts/articleshow/86717508.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Hyderabad||No ownership rights for RoFR patta holders: CM||Hyderabad: While asserting that the state government was committed to resolving the podu land issue, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the government would provide recognition of forest rights (RoFR) pattas to the tribals, who have been cultivating forest land for the last several years. However, he said the patta holders cannot get ownership rights under RoFR due to stringent norms on the forest land. He said a resolution will be passed in the state assembly in the current session seeking extension of cut-off date for handing over the land and a delegation with all-parties’ representatives would be taken to Prime Minister on the podu land issue. Speaking on the issue during a short discussion on Haritha Haram on Friday, the CM admitted there were conflicts and violent incidents between the tribals and forest officials in the last few years. “There were Supreme Court judgments where ownership of forest land cannot be changed. The UPA government put 2005 as cut-off year for giving pattas to the people cultivating the forest land. Pattas were given to 96,000 people in an extent of 3.08 lakh acres. For extending this facility to more people, the cut-off year, need to be extended now,” KCR said. The CM said the government had constituted a cabinet sub-committee to identify the issues and suggest measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-ownership-rights-for-rofr-patta-holders-cm/articleshow/86689396.cms||Koride Mahesh

An officer from the Kothrud police said the complainant, who is a beautician, came in contact with the PSI during the latter’s tenure with the Kothrud police. “The officer promised to marry her and established physical relationship with her. He repeated the act several times over the last three years before going back on his promise,” the officer said citing the complaint. The officer said the woman also claimed that the PSI did not tell her that he was married. “When the woman pursued him for marriage, the officer threatened that he would kill her and being a police officer can manage everything,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cop-booked-on-sexual-exploitation-charge/articleshow/86691831.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Over 9.35 lakh jabs given in September alone||Prayagraj: In yet another feat achieved by the district health department, as many as 9,35,340 jabs have been given to recipients of all age groups in September alone. In fact, the number of jabs given in September is equal to the jabs given in the months of July and August together. Ramping its vaccination drive, the health department has set a target to cover 46.10 lakh recipients of all age groups. About 47% of the target recipients have received at least a single dose so far. The number of jabs administered to the beneficiaries till August 31 was 17,90,757, which grew to 27,26,097 on September 30. Statistics of the health department revealed that right at the start of the vaccination drive against Covid-19, as many as 11,504 doses were given to frontline workers in January. In February, total number of doses given to recipients including frontline workers was 51,575, which rose to 1,17,625 in March. The figure went up to 1,86,853 in April. The number of doses administered crossed the two lakh mark in May when a total of 2,21,808 doses were given to recipients of all age groups. The tally rose to 2,74,860 and then 3,52,925 in June and July respectively. The pace of vaccination gained momentum in the second week of August, and a total of 5,84,496 jabs were given in August alone. However, September broke all previous records, and the number of vaccine shots given in September equalled the total number of jabs given in July and August months together. Till September 30, as many as 27,26,097 jabs have been given to eligible recipients, which includes 21,49,901 recipients of first dose and 5,76,196 recipients of second dose. This figure shows that around 13% of recipients in the district are fully vaccinated now. District immunization officer and additional chief medical officer, Dr Teerath Lal, told TOI that the department is making sincere efforts to achieve its set target, and more health teams have been engaged to administer jabs to all recipients. “Health teams have done a wonderful job during the mega vaccination camps. Many factors such as hard work and sincerity of health workers, micro plans to take the vaccination drive to remote areas, efforts of basic health workers to convince rural folks to get vaccinated have helped the health department script success stories,” said Dr Lal. Figures also revealed that the number of vaccine recipients aged between 18 and 44 years was five times more than that of the recipients aged above 45 years. However, now one can see recipients of all age groups lined up at rural and urban vaccination centres to get themselves jabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/over-9-35-lakh-jabs-given-in-september-alone/articleshow/86691027.cms||---

Urging on the need for more blood donation, health minister Raghu Sharma on the occasion of National Voluntary Blood Donation Day on Friday stated that Rajasthan needs at least 8 lakh units of blood every year. Attributing the poor collection to various factors like capping after Covid vaccination, misconception and hesitancy, Sharma stated that blood donation not only saves lives but it also helps a donor stay away from various diseases. Sharma added that there is a need for awareness about blood donation among the general public.“There are many misconceptions among the general public about blood donation, which need to be cleared. By donating blood, a person not only saves the life of somebody, but also can prevent self from many diseases,” he added. He was addressing a state-level felicitation function on National Voluntary Blood Donation Day organised by the Rajasthan Blood Transfusion Council on Friday. “Only 4 lakh units of blood have been collected till August this year. Around 8 lakh units of blood is required according to the population of the state, but due to lack of awareness, the number of voluntary blood donations is less,” he added.He added that regular blood donation does not cause any harm to the body, but many diseases can be prevented by donating blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-needs-8l-units-of-blood-every-year-min/articleshow/86695758.cms||---

According to officials, the tiger had devoured a portion of the head and leg of the victim who was letting his cattle graze when the big cat struck. “As the situation is becoming worse, an order to hunt the big cat has been issued under Section 11(a) of Wildlife Protection Act 1972”, principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden Sekhar Kumar Niraj told TOI. He clarified that it was not a shooting order but only a hunting order which means the aim would be to capture or trap the animal and shooting would be carried out only as a last resort. Identified as Mudumalai Division Tiger-23 (MDT-23), the 13-year-old male tiger had travelled 32km overnight from Devarshola in Gudalur division of forest to Masinagudi area in the buffer zone of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) before it targeted the tribal victim. In July 2019, the tiger had killed a forest dweller in the MTR-core area. After the elusive cat killed a worker in Devan-I estate on September 24, the forest department formed a team comprising 70 staff and officers, including three veterinarians, to capture the tiger. After two days of operation, a special team from Wayanad forest division in Kerala joined the Nilgiris team. Though the teams spotted the tiger in Devan-I estate and in Mayfield estate, 2km away, the tiger could not be captured during the first three days of the operation due to wet weather conditions. The tiger had killed four cows in the Devarshola range during that period. On Friday, local people in the Masinagudi area blocked the main road and staged a protest demanding that the tiger be shot. Forest, revenue and police officials held talks with the protesters to disperse the crowd. The order issued by the forest department said that it is to capture the problematic tiger identified as MDT 23 under Section 1 1 (1) (a) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as the said tiger has been resorting to continuous preying on livestock since July 2021. The order authorizes the conservator of forests and field director, MTR to take immediate action to hunt the tiger by engaging forest department personnel with strict adherence to the provisions of the section and the guidelines of NTCA as the tiger has become dangerous to human life in the area. The entire operation shall be carried out meticulously under the supervision of the conservator of forests and field director, MTR. Assistance from Kerala forest team and special task force should be taken for hunting the said tiger. The entire operation shall be photographed and video recorded and a detailed report should be submitted soon after completion of the operation. “The operation has been intensified and will resume on Saturday”, Niraj said. With a total area of 688sqkm, MTR is home to 103 tigers (as per NTCA updated in 2020) which is considered saturation level for tiger population. MTR is also home to the largest density of tigers among the five reserves in Tamil Nadu. Tigers defend their territories. It is suggested that the minimum territory size for a female tiger is around 10-15 sqkm while it is 50-60 sqkm for a male tiger. “Overpopulation may be the reason as older tigers lose their territory to young ones and stray to fringe areas”, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hunting-order-issued-as-man-eater-kills-3rd-victim/articleshow/86694013.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

According to the region's wholesalers and chemist associations, more than 10 lakh boxes of the tablet, manufactured by 47 different pharmaceutical companies, have been sold between August 28 and September 28 in Agra. A year's stock ran out in just a month, they said, adding that large firms are unable to meet the steep demand. With more patients falling to viral fever and dengue-like symptoms and most hospital beds full, people are using this precious drug for a quick fix. There is a scarcity in Firozabad district, but the drug is available in other parts, till now. Puneet Kalra, spokesperson of Agra Pharma association, said, “In the last one month, demand for paracetamol, an easily available drug, has risen significantly. A year's stock has been sold in just a month. Ten lakh boxes have been sold. Patients are looking for quick relief. Doctors are also prescribing it." Sunil Gupta, owner of a prominent drug store, said, "We kept a large stock of such regular medicines for Covid-19 and it is helping us now. But, if the demand remains the same then it would certainly put an acute strain on the supply in the days to come." "On an order of 10,000 boxes, we are getting 5,000 now. The situation cannot be sustained for long," he added. There is an increasing demand for paracetamol, antibiotics, cough syrups and vaporizers from Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Aligarh, Mainpuri, Hathras and Kasganj. The drug market of Agra region is considered to be one of the largest in the state. When contacted, drug inspector Raj Kumar said, “Paracetamol is a dispensable drug. We don’t maintain a record of its sales and purchase. We did not receive any formal complaints of drug shortages, so far.” Retailers added that the cost of antibiotics, other tablets for fever, cough and cold, stomach infection, multivitamins, skin allergy have increased from 10% to 50% in the past month and the sale of antibiotics and cough syrups has grown almost 10 times. On Thursday, additional director of the health department, AK Singh, said, “Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a common medication used to treat fever. During initial treatment, doctors prescribe it. Due to the recent surge in viral fever cases, district health authorities are placing a demand for paracetamol and other such drugs with the state government in advance. Adequate stocks are available at government-run centres." According to the health department, over 5,000 confirmed cases of dengue have been recently reported in Agra division. Of these, 4,480 were recorded in Firozabad district, 579 in Mathura, 180 in Agra and 120 in Mainpuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/impact-of-viral-fever-in-agra-region-a-years-stock-of-paracetamol-sold-in-a-month/articleshow/86689450.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Goa||FC Goa up against Mohammedan Sporting in Durand Cup final||FC Goa need something to cheer ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL) and what better way to brighten up everyone’s mood with the Durand Cup, Asia’s oldest football tournament. With a strong squad – minus the national team players -- Goa will believe they have more than a decent chance against Mohammedan SC at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan (VYBK) in Kolkata on Sunday, 6pm. Goa started the tournament as favourites after arriving with their strongest squad. They go into the summit clash after a hard-fought win over Bengaluru FC which headed into extra time and then the penalty shoot-out. “The players are very tired of course but they know it is the final and they will be ready,” FC Goa head coach Juan Ferando told TOI in an online interaction on Saturday. In seven years, Goa have only the ISL League Winners Shield and Super Cup to show. It could be Ferrando’s first trophy since taking over the reins last year, but the Spaniard is more focused on his team. “In this case I’m not thinking so far so close. Believe me, at this moment, my focus is working on my team, improving my team. And I hope they will be better day by day, game by game,” said Ferrando. On the other hand, Mohammedan will not only have the crowd support but also an extra day to recover. The I-League outfit also went into extra time before defeating 10-man FC Bengaluru United 4-2 in the semifinals. Coach Andrey Chernyshov’s is banking heavily on Trinidad and Tobago attacker Marcus Joseph and midfielder Nicola Stojanovic. But Goa, the only undefeated team in the competition, can be equally dangerous going forward with tournament’s joint highest scorer Devendra Murgaonkar (five goals). His striking partner, Muhammed Nemil, is not far behind with four goals and can easily influence the proceedings. With captain Edu Bedia and Alberto Noguera in midfield, Goa have easily dominated possession. However, they will have to be more careful while building moves from the back after goalkeeper Naveen Kumar conceded a goal in the very first minute in the last game. “Last game was a very tough game because playing in September, 90 minutes, and extra time is very very difficult. Winning a trophy in pre-season will give confidence for the rest of the year,” said Edu, now into his fifth season with Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-up-against-mohammedan-sporting-in-durand-cup-final/articleshow/86715480.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The girl was rescued on Thursday by cops from an apartment at Koradi, where cops arrested three women, who had arranged a ‘customer’ for Rs 40,000, and promised monetary help to the minor’s poverty-stricken family. Fortunately for the girl, the customer turned out to be a police informer. Sources said the minor’s mother is suffering from cancer and the family needed urgent money for her treatment. This fact is still being verified by the cops, as it was revealed by one of the accused. Sources also said the accused had convinced the minor to accompany them and do their bidding, and promised her Rs 5,000. During the raid, Archana Vaishampayan (39), Ranjana Meshram (45) and Kavita Nikhare (30) were arrested by Social Service Branch (SSB) of the crime branch, who had acted upon information from a NGO. Police said Vaishampayan and the minor’s mother were known to each other. The minor’s mother had volunteered to send the 11-year-old after Vaishampayan said she wanted her to work as a governess for her two-year-old son. On the pretext of taking care of her son during his birthday celebrations, Vaishampayan had taken the minor along with her to an apartment at Om Nagar at Koradi. The apartment was taken on rent by Meshram, where Nikhare had been assigned to fetch a customer for the girl’s virginity. Though police refused to part with details about the rescue operation, it’s learnt the ‘customer’ whom Nikhare identified, who was allegedly ready to pay Rs40,000, turned out to be a cop’s informer and alerted the SSB team. CP Amitesh Kumar said there was confidential information regarding a minor being readied for exploitation, following which cops swung into action to rescue her. It’s learnt Meshram and Vaishyampayan had been earlier arrested for flesh trade in separate cases. They had befriended each other in jail, said sources. Police said Vaishyampayan had approached the minor’s mother and later alerted Meshram about the girl being available for flesh trade. An offence was registered at Koradi police station and the rescued girl was sent to the government shelter home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-rescue-11-year-old-lured-into-selling-virginity-to-help-treat-mothers-cancer/articleshow/86691846.cms||Soumitra Bose

He said during question hour on Friday that due to the progressive policies of the TRS government, Telangana’s growth rate had been higher. “It increased year-on-year due to more annual average contribution from the primary, manufacturing and industry sectors, trade and repair services, real estate, ownership of dwelling and professional services (information technology) sub-sectors in the services sector of GSDP,” he said. Agriculture and its allied sectors registered 19.7% growth, the highest among all the sectors due to CM KCR’s focus on core sectors and completing irrigation projects and Mission Kakatiya programme. “As much as Rs 2.5 lakh crore was spent on agriculture and its allied sectors by the government in the last two-and-a-half years,” he said. Terming Telangana as a ‘performing state’, the 15th Finance Commission had recommended special grants to be given to Telangana.

He said some areas are getting inundated due to extreme weather conditions, cloud bursts, unseasonal rains and sudden heavy rains. “Even the world’s financial capital New York faced the flooding problem recently. We have seen video clippings where cars were floating in rain water,” KTR said. However, he said the TRS government has initiated strategic nala development programme (SNDP) with about Rs 858 crore in the first phase. Replying to questions by MLCs in the legislative council on Friday, the municipal minister said the government had resolved the drinking water and power issues in the past few years. This issue would also be resolved by taking up a strategy. The storm water drains have been designed to receive run-off when the city gets two cm rain. However, the city has been witnessing cloud bursts at regular intervals. “The nalas need to be widened. For this, RRR strategy is being taken up. Remove the encroachments, rehabilitate people and retain nala width. The government is also planning to relocate the people to 2-BHK houses,” the minister said, He regretted the incident at Manikonda where a software engineer was washed away in a nala. “There was negligence on the part of our municipal department in that incident as there was no proper railing. We have suspended two engineers who were responsible for the incident. Compensation will be paid to the family of the deceased, Rajinikanth,” KTR said. He said the government had taken up comprehensive road maintenance programme by privatising about 700 km roads in the city. “Since it was yielding good results, there is a plan to extend it to entire GHMC that covers about 9,000 kms,” KTR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rrr-strategy-will-solve-citys-inundation-woes-says-ktr/articleshow/86689482.cms||Koride Mahesh

During riots, naming a community and writing about incidents where they were targeted flares up communal tensions. No responsible journalist would do such communal reporting but Siddique Kappan only writes with an intent to incite Muslims,” the chargesheet said. “His background shows his agenda was to instigate Muslims, stir up communalism and defame the nation.” The Malayalam news portal Kappan was engaged with, ‘Azhimukham’, declined to comment on the stories and allegations. His counsel, Wills Mathews, told TOI that he has not received a copy of the chargesheet yet despite having applied for it thrice. “The police picked 36 articles out of hundreds he had written. None of his articles has anything suspicious and were spot reports widely covered in mainstream media,” he said. Kappan was arrested along with students Atiq-ur-Rehman, Masood Ahmad and their driver Mohammad Alam in October last year and charged with sedition and under the UAPA. The STF had accused them of “receiving funds from Muscat and Doha” to “foment caste riots” in Hathras, TOI had reported earlier. The STF has also submitted statements of “two eyewitnesses” who claim Kappan and Rehman were at Hathras the day after the victim’s body was cremated, trying to “incite a crowd against the administration”. The cremation had been done without consent from the victim’s family. “No evidence supporting these statements has been submitted. There is no toll footage, travel record or phone location data produced by the STF to back their claims. Besides, they were arrested on their way to Hathras. And do we know who these eyewitnesses are?” said Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, who is representing the other accused in the case at Mathura court. The chargesheet also referred to “47-page documents found at Kappan’s house” to accuse him of working to “validate” banned outfit SIMI. “It was an attempt to hide their terrorist activities and show their image as clean. There was an indication that Kappan was preparing the literature,” the chargesheet said. “Kappan was spreading hatred between castes through (his) journalism." Filing Kappan’s call records, WhatsApp chats and bank transaction details, the STF alleged that “huge cash” was deposited to his account from various places in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hathras-case-stf-cites-36-articles-to-say-kappan-was-inciting-communalism/articleshow/86689493.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Meerut||Death of minister: Don't blame cops without proof, says BJP MP||MEERUT: BJP MP from UP’s Baghpat and former Union minister Satyapal Singh on Friday slammed the opposition parties for “blaming police” for the death of a Kanpur businessman during a raid at a Gorakhpur hotel, saying that “death can happen due to any reason”. “All those policemen who had gone there on whatever information … Those cops have been suspended. Death can happen due to any reason and it is not necessary that it occurred because of the police. Till the time the investigation is not complete, we cannot arrive at a conclusion that the death occurred due to policemen,” the former police commissioner of Mumbai said at a function in Baghpat on Friday. The former Union minister attacked the opposition parties. “Accusation is not always true. Leveling allegations is the task of opposition. If we were in the opposition, we would have also done the same.” Manish Gupta, 36, had died of injuries allegedly received during a police raid in a Gorakhpur hotel on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. Later, six policemen were suspended and booked for murder. The death kicked-up a political storm at a time when the state is heading to polls. Singh is not new to controversies. In October last year, he had stirred up hornet’s nest when he had said, “Neither government nor police can stop rapes, for this the society has to be reformed. Opposition highlights such incidents for its own benefit.” Interestingly, in February 2019, it was Singh who had gone against his own party's government in UP when it had invoked ESMA banning all strikes in all departments and corporations under it for six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/death-of-bizman-dont-blame-cops-without-proof-says-bjp-mp/articleshow/86689469.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Meerut||Click & conserve: A helpline for your neighbour cluster of sparrows||MEERUT: Most birders are familiar with the dawn chorus of sparrows. The classic chirp is just like the dulcet tones of the cello. To conserve the dwindling population of house sparrows, the forest department in Meerut has come up with a novel idea of asking citizens to click pictures of the bird and send it, along with its GPS coordinates, on forestmeerut@gmail.com. This will follow a slew of measures to conserve the birds. “The idea behind celebrating World Sparrow Day on March 20 is to make people and those in power do something for the conservation of the bird species. It’s just not a day dedicated to the birds. It has more to it. Once the day is gone, we forget them, which should not be the case,” said Rajesh Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO), Meerut. “ The initiative, Kumar says, aims at encouraging locals to come together for the cause. The purpose is to locate their habitat, educate people and contribute in a constructive manner to enhance its population. As of now, there is no data suggesting a drop in the number of house sparrows. Still, scientists and ornithologists are worried. According to Dr Rajat Bhargava, senior scientist and ornithologist at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), “There are several pockets where sparrow roosts still exist. There one can see over a hundred sparrows congregating. Also, their presence around bougainvillea can’t be ruled out. There is no doubt that the dwindling population of house sparrows is a matter of concern, but public participation can certainly reverse it as it is one bird that builds nests in roof hatches of old buildings. All we need is a little effort.” “Foxtail millet or ‘kangni’, kodo millet or samak are their staple diet. If these plants are sown in a garden, sparrows will start returning but at the same time one should not remove grass from the garden as it promotes insect population which is good for baby sparrows. Some shrubs with thorns should also be planted as being small in size, sparrows can easily save themselves and their eggs from predatory birds and cats,” said Bhargava, explaining the methodology to attract sparrows. A bird lover from Meerut, Dr Joseph Zaidi, says, “It is indeed a welcome move. Though these birds nest in old houses and bungalows, with some artificial alterations, new buildings or their lawns can also be made conducive for them. We should all come together to relive those memories of waking up to the chirping of sparrows every morning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/click-conserve-a-helpline-for-your-neighbour-cluster-of-sparrows/articleshow/86689505.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Allahabad||On Gandhi Jayanti, remembering Bapu’s document mentioning Pratapgrah||Prayagraj: Mahatma Gandhi’s idea of socialism, especially the one which envisioned that zamindars, talukdars and ordinary farmers share the same platform, was immensely influenced by his experience of seeing the behaviour of the zamindars of the neighbouring district of Pratapgrah. This becomes clear in the document, written by Mahatma Gandhi himself on December 5, 1929, wherein he mentions how he was, "impressed by the young zamindars of the district and how the feeling of patriotism and nationalism can be seen in their personality for which they lived a simple lifestyle and refrained from all worldly extravagant expenditure." The document was found among the 15 files procured by regional archives of Prayagraj from Pratapgarh. These and many more documents related to Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri were displayed by regional archives in the city, on Friday. According to the technical assistant (history) of the department, R K Verma, it was in file number one titled material for district gazetteers relating to chapter-II of the political history of the Deohars 1929, that several documents relating to zamindars, talukdars and farmers of Pratapgrah were found. “In one such letter, believed to have been written by Mahatma Gandhi himself, the father of the nation is telling the editor of a Gujrati newspaper 'Navjivan' about what he has witnessed at Pratapgah, about farmers and landlords of the district”, said the official. In the document, written on December 5, 1929, Gandhi mentions how he is impressed by the young zamindars of the district their spirit of patriotism and nationalism can be seen in their personality as they "live a simple lifestyle and refrain from all worldly extravagant expenditure." He mentioned that he was both surprised and impressed as to how the zamindars and talukdars of this district were different from the ones he has found or heard of in different parts of the country. Here the young zamindars refrain from indulging in atrocities and exploiting the farmers, rather they are patrons of the farming community and enjoy massive support. The document further narrates how Gandhi has spoken about his idea of socialism, telling about the responsibilities of the zamindars. “Gandhi says, zamindars and big landlords should open schools, hospitals etc., in their properties and also to serve the masses”, said Verma. Some of the papers in the same file also tell about how Gandhi had gone to meet the Raja of Kalakanker, Avdesh Singh on December 5, 1929, who along with his wife had donated an amount of Rs 5,500 for the party funds. “The flag of the National Congress Party was also hoisted at the house of Kuvar Suresh Singh," informed the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/on-gandhi-jayanti-remembering-bapus-document-mentioning-pratapgrah/articleshow/86691126.cms||---

On the BSE, the stock was listed at Rs 475, rallied and closed at Rs 499, which was also the day’s high for it.

The company now has a market value of nearly Rs 1,950 crore, BSE data showed. On September 23, the Rs 171-crore IPO of Navi Mumbai-based Paras Defence closed with a 304-time oversubscription. The offer for the supplier to defence and space sectors in India and abroad was in the price band of Rs 165 to Rs 175 per share. The portion of the IPO reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed nearly 928 times, the part reserved for retail investors was subscribed almost 113 times while the institutional investor category was subscribed about 170 times. Soon after the IPO closed, Astha Daga, senior VP, Anand Rathi Advisors, the lead manager to the offer, told TOI that a very strong sector outlook, coupled with the company’s unique position as one of the leading private sector suppliers to the country’s defence & space sectors generated strong interest among investors. A relatively modest IPO size also helped generate good investor interest, Daga had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paras-defence-nearly-triples-investors-wealth-on-listing/articleshow/86697133.cms||---

Pawar, along with NCP’s Baramati MP Supriya Sule, minister of state for forest Dattatray Bharne and district collector Rajesh Deshmukh visited the fort for an inspection and discussed various plans. Later, he told media-persons, “Physically fit people can easily come to the fort, but what about aged people? To address this concern, we have decided to have a ropeway project often found at tourist destinations abroad. The agency concerned has taken all permissions so far. However, several opinions on the project have come from people. Some of them said that the ‘doli’ facility can be made available for aged people. As a result, we have decided to further examine it.” The ropeway will be the second service after one at the Raigad fort in Satara district in the state. Pawar reiterated that tourists and visitors will soon travel on e-busses of the PMPML to the fort. Parking space for private vehicles will be created at the foothills of the fort. The forest department will allocate dedicated space for food stalls at the foothills of the fort. “All the development work at the fort will be carried out with a heritage touch,” Pawar added. The guest house constructed by the Pune Zilla Parishad will be removed from the fort soon, said Pawar. The encroachments at the foothills of the fort will be removed by the state forest department in the coming days, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-examine-ropeway-proposal-at-sinhagad-fort-from-all-angles-ajit-pawar/articleshow/86691910.cms||---

The list was submitted to city police commissioner Ajay Tomar and action was demanded against those involved in the racket. FOGWA recently held a meeting over the issue which saw participation of leaders of various industrial societies where the weaving units are located. In the meeting it was decided to expose these firms and demand strict actions against them.  According to FOGWA, these firms have duped weavers of around Rs 10 crore in the past six months. “But the actual size of the racket is much bigger. It is a multi-crore racket in which a handful of brokers are involved. These are not simple cheatings but well-planned rackets,” said Ashok Jirawala, president of FOGWA. Jirawala alleged that there are groups operating in the market that make purchases of textile products worth crores of rupees for a few months and then suddenly disappear without making payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fogwa-red-flags-57-firms-for-cheating-weaving-units/articleshow/86690851.cms||---

The casualties may rise as a rescue operation was on and earthmovers were clearing the debris till the last report came in. According to locals, at least 15 workers were inside the building when the blast ripped through it, not only blowing off the entire structure housing the illegal unit but also damaging neighbouring houses in Kairana town of Shamli. Mohammad Rashid, owner of the unit which was on Jaganpura road, is on the run. Heavy police force and administrative officials were camping in front of the blast site. District magistrate (DM) Jasjeet Kaur and superintendent of police (SP) Sukriti Madhav were among them, overseeing the rescue effort. “The injured have been rushed to a hospital. Four workers have been killed in the blast. Rescue operation is on and debris is being removed. A probe has also been launched,” DM Kaur said. Three workers who lost their lives were identified as Faeemuddin, Salman and Pappi. The identity of the fourth man who died in the explosion is yet to be established. In April this year, a similar blast in a cracker-making unit in Bijnor, about 100km from here, had claimed five lives and left several injured. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had taken note of the incident and had directed senior officials to take steps to check the recurrence of such tragedies. In January last year, a similar blast in Shamli district had led to the death of five persons, including three women. The owner of the factory, 45-year-old Intezar Ahmed, was also among the dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/4-dead-four-critical-as-explosion-rips-firecracker-unit-in-up/articleshow/86689588.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Cops swung into action after the video went viral on social media. Addressing media persons on Friday, deputy commissioner of police, Manoharsinh Jadeja said that an application regarding this video was registered with A division police station. “We are investigating on three points — authenticity of the contents of the video, its source and if it was from any party,” he said. The video taken from a height appears to be from a hotel on Yagnik road. Cops have collected CCTV footage of the hotel’s entry and exit gates for the past one week and are analysing it. Cops have also collected photocopy of the register’s past one week records. A video, which was shot from a distance showing a blurred image of a woman dancing in her nude near the window of the hotel room, has gone viral on social media on Thursday. The view of the building’s exterior appears to be that of a luxurious hotel. According to Jadeja, the hotel manager expressed ignorance of the incident and said that what happens inside the rooms are none of his business as hotel honours guests’ privacy and any sort of intrusion will amount to violation of privacy. Meanwhile, the police will send the video for forensic testing once they find its source. However, looking at the interiors of the room in one video, cops have confirmed it’s a hotel in Rajkot. Regarding the type of offence that can be registered in this case, Jadeja said that if two persons are found dancing inside the room, no offence will be registered. But, if it was part of a party, it will call for an offence to be registered. The hotel owners, however, told the police that they do not allow parties to take place inside the hotel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cops-in-a-tizzy-over-video-of-nude-dancer-in-hotel/articleshow/86691119.cms||---

The reptile had ventured on the rail track when a moving train mowed it down. Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) volunteers said that they received a call from Karjan railway station for rescuing the reptile. “We got a call from Karjan railway station that an injured crocodile was found near the rail tracks. One of its legs got amputated after a train ran over it. By the time we reached the spot, the reptile had died,” said Raj Bhavsar of GSPCA. This is the second such incident at Karjan in the last one month. The reptile must have ventured out of some nearby waterbody to migrate to another spot, a volunteer said. Late on the night of September 13, a moving train ran over an eight-feet-long crocodile about 5km from Karjan railway station. The rail authorities had stopped train movement and even kept Rajdhani Express on hold to ensure that the reptile was rescued. But the crocodile died due to severe injuries on its skull. The GSPCA volunteers also rescued two more reptiles in the last 24 hours. On Thursday, a five-feet-long crocodile was rescued from Bajetha village on the outskirts of the city. Another three-feet-long reptile was also rescued from Chhapad village at 11 pm. During monsoons waterbodies get flooded so the reptiles often venture out to safer spots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/baby-crocodile-run-over-by-train-near-karjan/articleshow/86690192.cms||---

The turnout was 61.6% on April 26, during the assembly elections. In Three wards — 71, 77 and 83 — reported over 60% polling this time. The polling percentage could have been higher, had Ward 63, which covers Chowringhee, the Ripon Street-Royd Street belt, Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani and Maidan not reported the lowest turnout of 43%. Ward 82, covering Chetla, had the highest 65.2% turnout of voters, while the second highest turnout (61.4%) was recorded in Ward 71 that mostly covers the Bhowanipore areas. The third highest turnout was in Ward 77 that covers Kidderpore. The turnout here was nearly 60%. The rest of the Bhowanipore wards reported a turnout of over 50%. In Murshidabad’s Samserganj, the turnout was 80%, while Jangipur reported 77.6% polling, according to the EC’s final voters’ turnout tally. Even in 2011 bypolls, when the CM had contested from Bhowanipore, she had won by a thumping margin of 54,000 votes against Nandini Mukherjee of CPM. At that time, the polling percentage was 44 as only 95,000 voters had turned out. Even in the assembly polls of 2011, when Subrata Bakshi had won by 49,000 votes, the turnout was 63.8% as 1.35,000 voters exercised their franchise. Bakshi had later resigned to facilitate the CM to win from Bhowanipore. Incidentally, during the first assembly polls in 1952, the polling percentage was only 44% as 21,353 people had voted among 48,500 voters. Mira Dutta Gupta of Congress was the first MLA of Bhowanipore, who bagged 7,879 votes. However, experts point that in the first assembly polls, the turnout was around 42% with only 74.4 lakh people out of the total electorate of 1.7 crore casting their votes in Bengal. When Siddhartha Shankar Ray had won the Bhowanipore seat as a Congress candidate in 1957, he bagged 13,699 out of 26, 972 votes polled, though the total voters were 67,666. Thus, the polling was less than 40%. Ray had won the seat in 1962 as an independent candidate supported by Left parties when he had got 18,297 out of 39,120 votes polled. In 1962 there was 68.3% polling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/57-turnout-at-bhowanipore-bypoll-highest-polling-in-chetla/articleshow/86692000.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The village recyclers are starting the Chorao waste management initiative by riding an electric vehicle to ‘drive’ around the Chorao island, blasting out music about waste management in honour of Mahatma Gandhi’s efforts to improve public health and environmental protection, and also to spread awareness about the importance of managing waste. “It is important to note that Chorao is undergoing a trash crisis. Public health is at risk from the increasingly problematic dumping and burning of hazardous waste. We are joining hands as a community to start with household awareness and teachings on how to manage waste at home and to prepare it safely for the new scientific trash collection mechanism,” said a volunteer. Currently there is no organised system of trash collection to disposal in Chorao.

Oyo joins a slew of startups in tapping the public market. Zomato had a successful Indian IPO in July, and Freshworks an equally successful one in the US last month. Nykaa, Paytm, and Policybazaar are others expected to file soon. Oyo’s IPO price band was not disclosed in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed with Sebi. A Reuters report said Oyo is seeking a valuation of $10 billion to $12 billion. The IPO comprises 83% or Rs 7,000 crore of fresh issue of shares. The remaining 17%, or Rs 1,430 crore, will be an offer for sale. The hotel aggregator is planning to use the proceeds from the fresh issue towards paring debt, prepayment of certain borrowings by its subsidiaries, for acquisitions, and to expand its footprint. Agarwal and some of the investors in the company, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, China’s ride-hailing company Didi, Greenoaks Capital, Airbnb, and Microsoft, will not offload any stake in the offering. SoftBank, Grab, China Lodging, and Global IVY Ventures will all sell a small stake each The company has the option to raise up to Rs 1,400 crore in a pre-IPO placement. Founded in 2012 as Oravel Stays, Oyo’s technology platform has reshaped the fragmented global hospitality industry, especially the small and mid-size hotels. Agarwal, then 18, launched Oravel as an aggregator of bed & breakfasts and serviced apartments in Delhi. The following year, he won the Peter Thiel Fellowship, a two-year, $100,000 grant for young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom. The same year, Oravel became Oyo. Oyo today has more than 157,000 properties across more than 35 countries. India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Europe are its biggest markets. Its app was the most downloaded accommodation app in Asia and third largest in the world in 2020, according to app insights provider Sensor Tower. The company mostly now works on a franchisee model, where most of the investments are made by the hotel owner. Oyo provides the booking platform, and ensures standardisation of facilities and services. The pandemic had a major adverse impact on the business, forcing the company to end the practice of providing monthly minimum guarantees or fixed payout commitments. Oyo’s revenue fell 70% to Rs 4,157 crore last year due to the pandemic. But it also narrowed its losses to Rs 3,943 crore, compared to Rs 13,122 crore in the year before. The company recently said it will hire more than 300 technology professionals to help it become a full-stack technology provider for small and mid-sized hotels and homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oyo-latest-startup-to-file-for-ipo-eyes-over-rs-8k-cr/articleshow/86697201.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Two programmes were organized during the day — on NRS campus in the morning and at National Library in the evening.  Both events were attended by India’s first “test tube baby” Kanupriya Agarwal, whom Mukhopadhyay had christened “Durga” when she was born on October 3, 1978. Mukhopadhyay’s bust was unveiled on the NRS Hospital campus while a demand for conferring Bharat Ratna on Mukhopadhyay was officially made at the National Library event. The boys’ hostel has been named after Mukhopadhyay and a plaque bearing his name has been put up outside the room he stayed in. Former colleagues, students and doctors recalled their association with Mukhopadhyay at NRS. Recalling his teacher as “an inconspicuous man with a briefcase”, eye surgeon Abhijit Ghosh said, “He wanted to send the message that a doctor must also be a scientist.” “I am thrilled that our crusade for my scientific father’s Bharat Ratna or Padma Vibhushan may now be a reality,” Kanupriya told TOI.

Health officials said the number of cases was on gradual decline in the rural and urban pockets of PMR. “The sustained efforts by the health department have finally paid off, especially in the rural pockets where daily positive caseload was over 500 at the beginning of September and has reduced below 500-mark now,” an official said. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief at PMC, said, “Daily cases have dropped below 200 since last few days in the municipal limits. We are monitoring the cases to see effect of the relaxations. So far, no significant spurt has been reported in any of the civic ward in the city.” An official from the district administration said, “Daily cases in the rural pockets have continued to stay below 500 after September 17. We expect the trend to continue. Our teams are monitoring the cases and citizens have been appealed to continue with Covid-appropriate behaviour. The Covid mitigation efforts will be in place in all the areas recording more cases.” The region’s recovery rate has shot up in September and reached 97.81% following an increase in discharges. According to the district health office data, the recovery rate at the end of August was 97.48% and 97.4% at end of July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-23k-pmrs-sept-caseload-drops-to-least-since-january/articleshow/86692006.cms||Sarang Dastane

SI Jai Prakash Yadav, who was hit by Shailendra during a brawl with some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office-bearers inside Saiyyedraja police station on September 28, and three constables were also suspended by SP Chandauli Amit Kumar on Friday on the charges of “damaging the image of police by their act”. A total of three FIRs had been lodged from both sides in this episode. SP Chandauli said, “On September 28, one Vishal Madheshiya, vice-president of Saiyyedraja divisional unit of BJP, had reached the police station in a matter of land dispute between two persons of the same area. When cops at police station asked Madheshiya to talk in low voice, he had a brawl with the policemen, including SI Jai Prakash Yadav, constables-Krishna Kumar Singh, Satyalok Chauhan and Shailendra Yadav. The conduct of these policemen was derogatory for the image of police, hence they were suspended.” Further investigation in this matter is continuing, he added. A night-long high-voltage drama had taken place inside the Saiyyedraja police station in the presence of CO Anil Kumar Rai and BJP district chief and other office-bearers. Shailendra had hit the SI while using casteist remarks. ASP Chandauli Dayaram Saroj said that for hitting the SI, Shailendra had been arrested after an FIR was lodged against him under sections 323, 332, 353, 504 and 506 of IPC after midnight on Thursday. “Before the arrest of Shailendra,” Rai said, “one FIR against four suspended cops had been lodged under sections 323 and 307 of IPC on the complaint of Madheshiya on September 28, while on the complaint of the SI another FIR was lodged against Madheshiya under sections 332, 353, 504 and 506 of IPC.

---||Kolkata||Pay school fee dues by October 25, says Calcutta high court||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Friday directed all defaulting parents to pay their school fee arrears by October 25. Schools have been directed not to rusticate any kid for the time being and allow all of them to sit for boards, annual or mid-term exams. Parents will have the right to pay “disputed” and “undisputed” amounts separately. The order given by the division bench of Justice I P Mukerji and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya said the court received affidavits from schools, saying their outstanding fees added up to a substantial amount, running into crores, and that if the fees were not received it would be difficult for schools to run or pay bonus to their employees in the festive period. The order, however, mentioned that the court had also received several contempt petitions from parents, claiming schools were not charging the amounts according to the HC order of October 13, 2020. This order stated that parents had suffered due to the pandemic and could be allowed to pay 80% of the tuition fees. But “a dispute has been raised that the bills raised by the schools and other educational institutions are not in accordance with the said order”, Friday’s order stated. Many parents had filed contempt petitions that schools were charging much more than what the court had specified and that they had paid amounts, which were the court-sanctioned amounts. Many schools had allegedly refused to accept these calculations done by parents. This led to a deadlock and schools had clubbed parents, who had paid according to this calculation, with defaulting guardians. Friday’s order clarified that parents would have to clear the entire amount decided upon by schools by October 25, but they could segregate the fees as “undisputed” and “disputed” portions and label them accordingly during the payment. “The school authorities will be entitled to straightaway appropriate the admitted amount. They shall also receive the disputed amount, deposit the same in a separate account and keep an account,” Friday’s order said. The court has asked each school to file an affidavit, to show the amounts they received according to Friday’s order, prepare a list of defaulting parents and the total amount due from each of them. The court will hear both sides on December 3. Meanwhile, no school could rusticate any student and would have to allow them to sit for all exams, court said. “The direction of the court upon parents to pay fees by October 25 in the manner provided in the order will help schools to run and maintain them for the benefit of all the stakeholders,” said lawyer Sourav Bhagat, who represented Birla High School, South Point School, MP Birla Foundation, Shri Shikshayatan. Parents’ groups also lauded the order. “Most parents are facing a stand-off with school authorities because there has been a dispute over the outstanding amount. We welcome the order. We will now see how many school managements take this order seriously,” said Sanjeev Sharma, secretary of United Parents’ Protection Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/court-pay-school-fee-dues-by-oct-25/articleshow/86692086.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kolkata||E-vehicle charging stns at old tram depots soon: Min||Kolkata: The state government is planning to convert the old tram depots of the city into electric vehicle charging stations to introduce more electric-run vehicles. The transport department is also planning to introduce 1,000 electric buses in the city by April next year. State transport and housing department minister Firhad Hakim inaugurated the three-day electric vehicle carnival, organised by New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), at Eco Park on Friday evening. The carnival that demonstrates the use of various e-vehicles will conclude on Sunday. Hakim said that the government is trying to phase out fuel-run vehicles from the streets gradually. “We are going to set up electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the city. The old tram depots will be converted into EV charging stations. We are looking for more spaces in KMC areas to set up EV charging stations. In the next three to four months, Kolkata and its adjacent areas will have enough EV charging stations. We have already introduced two EV charging stations in Kolkata and will have 100 more such stations in the city soon,” Hakim added. The civic authorities of New Town will ink an MoU with their counterparts in a British town that has excelled in promoting e-vehicles. The NKDA chairman, Debashis Sen, said they will develop a centre of excellence to promote electric vehicles. The state government has already come up with an electric vehicle policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-vehicle-charging-stns-at-old-tram-depots-soon-min/articleshow/86692135.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Pune||Quick-service restaurants in Pune struggle to resume dine-in service||PUNE: Nearly half of the quick-service restaurants (QSRs) in the city have found themselves unable to restart dine-in services even after the closing deadline was extended to 10pm in August. “Many QSRs had stopped dine-in after restarting the service almost a month ago when the deadline extension was granted. Since most are in malls and IT hubs, dine-ins have not been viable as the double-vaccination rule for entry to malls has caused a drop in footfalls, while a chunk of the IT crowd is still absent from the city,” Lovely Narang, president of the United Hospitality Association, and owner, Food Music Love, told TOI. “Nearly 50% of the quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are still offering only home deliveries. QSRs in IT hubs have been the worst-affected,” he added. He further said fine-dining restaurants that have restarted full-fledged service are yet to meet operational costs — the 50% cap on seating is affecting business. “We have requested the government to extend the deadline,” Narang said. A facility on the lines of Balewadi High Street, called Social Street, is being planned in Hinjewadi. But here too, QSRs are holding back for now. “A few fine-dining restaurants and bars are ready to open here. Though Hinjewadi has opened up, a chunk of outstation crowd has still not returned. The ongoing work-from-home scenario has affected the Hinjewadi hospitality sector immensely,” a top source from the hospitality and restaurant industry said. “IT professionals tend move into residences closer to their workplace, which pushes up business for restaurants in the vicinity,” he said. “A couple of QSRs in our mall haven’t opened as their staff has yet to be fully vaccinated. Other restaurants too haven’t opened yet as they are waiting for multiplexes to start. We expect most eateries in malls to open by Dasara,” Arun Arora, centre director of Phoenix Marketcity, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/quick-service-restos-struggle-to-resume-dine-in-service/articleshow/86692027.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Breakthrough infection after both jabs a concern, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar||PUNE: Breakthrough infection after two doses of vaccination at 0.25% in district was a concern, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Friday. It was 0.19% after one dose. People who have taken one dose or have been fully inoculated seem to ignoring the Covid protocols as stated by the medical experts which has led to these infections. According to the data, there were 14,182 breakthrough infections (0.19%) among 71.62 lakh citizens vaccinated with the first dose while among the 33.74 lakh citizens vaccinated with both doses, 8836 (0.25%) breakthrough infections were detected. “The state is slowly beginning to unlock with schools, religious places and cinema houses opening up. Citizens must continue to take precautions and follow the protocols of masking and social distancing,” he said. Citing data from the health department, Pawar said breakthrough infections was higher among citizens who have received both jabs as compared to single dose and health experts have said the fully vaccinated were not adhering to the Covid norms. “Those being infected seem to have ignored the protocols and were not following basic masking and social distancing norms which could have led to breakthrough infections,'' Pawar said. Experts have repeatedly said that even after both the jabs people have to continue to follow the protocol and people must take adequate precautions after receiving their vaccines too. There have been reports of syringe shortages for the vaccination drives, but the local administration should take the initiative to ensure that there is no shortage of syringes, he said. Nearly five lakh vaccines have been donated by various corporate firms for the process. He said that Pune district will have 75 hours of vaccination in the coming week in select assembly constituencies with support from CSR initiatives, he added. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has started the initiative from September 30. Currently, the district has covered 85% of population with the first dose and 47% population with the second dose of vaccination. There were 24.27 lakh vaccinations in September in the district. Meeting on funds for Covid payout A meeting on shortage of funds to pay the kin of Covid victims under the Disaster Management Act will be held in Mumbai on Monday. Earlier, state relief and rehabilitation minister and senior Congressman Vijay Wadettiwar had said that the Centre had sanctioned only Rs 1,100 crore of the Rs 7,700 crore aid sought by the state government to deal with damages caused in natural calamities. At the recent State Disaster Response Force meeting, participants said there was a shortage of funds for disbursing Covid death claims. The Union government had directed states to disburse ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000 to the kin of Covid victims. However, with 1.38 lakh deaths already and the toll likely to exceed 1.50 lakh, the amount being sought was Rs 780 crore which could go up to Rs 1,000 crore. "The meeting will discuss whether the state should arrange for the amount or will the NDRF take it up,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/breakthrough-infection-after-both-jabs-a-concern/articleshow/86692078.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Her body was found near farmlands on the outskirts of her village, strangled, bruised. Police arrested a man within two hours but had to let him go because of “lack of evidence”. On Friday, when the body of the Dalit girl reached her village, the girls she grew up with couldn’t hold back. In a series of videos shared widely, the teenaged girls are seen breaking down and demanding their “right to live”. “She was my sister. We will all die like that. If we want safety — we are not even safe at home — where do we go?” said one of them in a video. “What is beti bachao, beti padhao? Who is saving daughters?” The girls at Kirra, where the murder took place, formed a human chain when the police and district administration officials arrived. For hours, they cried out in protest against the unsafe environment they have had to get used to. “They’ll not let us step out or study … We don’t have roads to talk on without men leering at us like wolves … We endure all of this just to study ... Lock us up, don’t let us go to school for what you call our safety. This is what our families will do. They won’t raise their voices for us. We will do it for ourselves,” a girl says in a video. They raised two demands — a school in their village and a police picket. “We want a school in her name so girls don’t have to leave the village to study,” one of the girls, her cousin, said. Another added, “It has been a long-due demand that a police picket be set up near our village. If we go out, who will ensure we get home safely?” The men joined in as well, following the body in a procession. The village pradhan, Ajay Kumar, submitted a memorandum to the police, demanding compensation for the family, a permanent police posting near the spot where she was attacked, a school in her name and security for girls who go to study. He also sought that the road to his village be lit up. “There was panic but the administration said it would meet our demands,” he told TOI. About the investigation, Bulandshahr Police did not confirm if the man they had caught earlier is the accused. “We have detained one man. We are still combing the area. We are interrogating him as well but there are doubts in the minds of the villagers,” said Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Singh. “The autopsy done by a three-member panel of doctors found she died of head injuries. There are no other injury marks on her body. The cremation went off peacefully."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/lock-us-up-dont-let-us-study-kill-us-girls-rise-in-protest-after-stalker-murders-16-yr-old-student/articleshow/86689677.cms||Ishita Mishra

We could, however, carry out only 14 elective surgeries on Friday as some of the resident doctors went on strike. Emergency medical work, including Covid medical management, is going on as the resident doctors involved in these have not gone on strike,” said hospital’s medical superintendent Ajay Taware. Maharashtra’s resident doctors called for an indefinite strike across the state on Friday. The Maharashtra State Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) declared the strike would begin from 11am on Friday and continue till their demands were met. The doctors have demanded waiver of tuition fees for postgraduate medical students, Covid incentives and better hostel facilities at government-run medical colleges, among others. “The demands of the resident doctors have not been resolved till now. The state government has not taken them seriously. Hence, we decided to go on a state-wide strike from October 1,” said MARD president Dnyaneshwar Dhobale. Only the residents working under the BMC got Covid incentives. Even those, working in the peripheries and over government colleges deserve these incentives, as they were equally working in Covid wards, the MARD has demanded. “The strike will continue till we get in writing that these demands would be fulfilled,” Dhobale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elective-surgeries-hit-as-resident-docs-go-on-strike/articleshow/86692089.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to launch special campaign to resolve issues of people||JAIPUR: The state government on Saturday will launch a six-month special campaign, christened ‘Shahar-2021’ in the urban areas to resolve citizens’ problems after organising camps in the urban local bodies. The opening day will record a ceremonious procession with a band, where five families will be issued lease deeds at chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s residence, after they reach there from Bais Godam Circle. Urban Development and Housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal said, “Our government is seriously working for the success of the campaign through close monitoring, with the objective of providing the much-desired ‘ease of living’ to the common citizens.” A special website — ‘shahar2021.rajasthan.gov.in’ — has been developed containing the online application facility. Training has been imparted to officers of local bodies to run the online system. Also, to render technical assistance to the citizens, 600 ‘Nagar Mitras’ have been registered for all towns of Rajasthan. Advisor to the government and former UDH principal secretary GS Sandhu said, “Due to the long Covid pandemic, which adversely affected the financial condition of the common man, several rebates and concessions including reduction in interest charges have been announced.” The state government’s aim is to issue 10 lakh lease deeds during the campaign. It has been majorly emphasised to provide lease deeds in old areas of the Walled City. An official said that as the well known cities and towns in Rajasthan came up during the erstwhile princely states and some of the towns are centuries old, with Jodhpur being about 600 years old, Udaipur about 500 years, Kota about 400 years and Jaipur about 300 years, around 35 to 40 lakh residents living in these areas do not have lease deeds. “In 2015, an amendment was carried out in the Rajasthan Municipal Act, 1959 enabling issuance of title deeds to these residents by urban local bodies in lieu of their surrendering of the editing rights by them. However, this provision was scarcely used and remained on paper. The present government has decided to revisit the relevant provisions, rules and circulars to issue the lease deeds and benefit the residents,” added the official. The second plank of the campaign is the regularisation of colonies on agriculture land. “It is estimated that about 7-8 lakh houses partially or fully constructed on agriculture land need title deeds,” an official said. During the campaign, the local bodies will also issue free-hold pattas by replacing the lease hold pattas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-to-launch-spl-campaign-to-resolve-issues-of-people/articleshow/86694274.cms||---

The ADG had given a statement, wherein he had said that the guilty policemen would be arrested after investigation. On this, Meenakshi while talking to media persons here, said, “When the Chief Minister has assured me of a CBI inquiry, then what investigation will he do. We don’t expect such irresponsible behaviour from such a senior officer.” She further said that it is her humble appeal to the police officers of Gorakhpur not to break her courage by making such irresponsible statements. Meenakshi said that CM has solved her problems like her elder brother. Meenakshi told media persons further that on Friday morning, she received a call wherein the new station in-charge of the concerned police station of Gorakhpur asked her to reach there and get her statement recorded. She said, “I replied to him saying that if he wants to record my statement, then do come to Kanpur. It is not possible for me to reach there at this point of time. Also, I do not trust Gorakhpur police any more.” She also alleged that the way the investigation Gorakhpur police is doing, is not to get justice for her husband but to save it’s policemen. “I have full faith in the city police (Kanpur police). I am really thankful to them as talks with the CM could only be possible with their efforts,” she said. On the question of CBI investigation, Meenakshi said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is like her elder brother, has assured her of justice. “It will take some time to start the CBI probe, but strict action will be taken against the culprits, I have full faith in the Chief Minister, and I am hopeful that CBI investigation will start soon,” said Meenakshi further. The family members of property dealer Manish Gupta, meanwhile, also accused Gorakhpur police of looting Rs 1.5 lakh and the gold rings he was wearing. They gave this information to the local police and said that they only found Manish’s briefcase in return, but his rings and cash were not returned. Along with this, the relative has also demanded a probe into the role of the operator and manager of the hotel in Gorakhpur where Manish Gupta stayed with his associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/guptas-widow-accuses-gorakhpuradg-of-making-irresponsible-remarks/articleshow/86690959.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Goa||Socorro panchs fear repeat of Siridao incident||Panaji: Socorro panchayat expects a repeat of the Siridao incident where government machinery was misused to delay the no-confidence motion and election of a new sarpanch. The six members of Socorro panchayat who moved a no-confidence motion against Socorro sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar have accused the government of adopting double standards. The panchs, led by Anil Pednekar, pointed out that when BJP-backed panchs ousted the sarpanch in Salvador do Mundo, the entire process was completed within seven days, whereas in the case of Soccoro, the gap between moving the no-confidence motion and the meeting to discuss it is 13 days. The six panchs, who are backed by Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte, are alleging that BJP is “meddling” into the panchayat’s affairs. Addressing a press conference along with other members — Sandeep Manjrekar, Reshma Morajkar, Maya Keni, Sanjay Pednekar and Rovlu Parsekar — Pednekar said that the block development officer (BDO) or panchayat secretary may remain absent on October 5, when the no-confidence motion will be discussed. “Two yardsticks are used for panchayats in the same constituency. This raises doubt that the process may be sabotaged the way they had done in case of the Siridao-Pale panchayat where the BJP panel was defeated,” Pednekar said. The six panchs said that if the government “plays dirty”, they would approach the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/socorro-panchs-fear-repeat-of-siridao-incident/articleshow/86694251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man duped of Rs 1 crore with yarns of death, kidnap by e-pals||MUMBAI: In a case that has left city cops baffled about the level of gullibility among victims of cyber crime, a scheming mother-daughter duo and a relative allegedly cooked up stories of ailments, death and abduction to dupe a man in his fifties of Rs 1.1 crore online. The trio was arrested by the north region cyber police and their bank accounts were frozen. The prime accused, Rani Sarang (42), sent a friendship request to the victim on Facebook this April. Sarang claimed her husband and the victim used to be colleagues at an electrical works company 17 years ago. The victim believed her and accepted her friendship request. The two began to chat over Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and became friends. After some time passed, Sarang told the victim she had suffered a brain stroke and was in need of money. The victim transferred the sum she asked for to her. After she claimed to have “recovered”, Sarang told the man her daughter was down with a serious illness. She asked for more money from the victim. Thereafter, she told him that her uncle had died and she needed funds to organise his funeral. “Sarang’s 24-year-old daughter, Ruchika Hatipkar, contacted the victim next. She told him her mother had passed away and she needed funds for her funeral. The victim paid up again,” a police official said. Sarang’s relative, Prasad Bhanushali, thereafter reached out to the victim and said she had not died but in fact had been abducted. He asked the victim to help organise money to pay the ransom. Later, he told the victim that Sarang had contracted a mental illness and was in need of electric shock therapy. The victim paid up every time. Sarang and her accomplices had created several aliases online to swindle the victim. When the victim started to demand his money back, Sarang and her accomplices shut their Facebook accounts. Last month, he approached the north region cyber police after being duped of more than a crore over six months. The police used technical surveillance methods to uncover the accused’s identities and their whereabouts. The trio was held and Rs 17 lakh was frozen in their bank accounts. Police also found gold worth Rs 22 lakh that the accused had purchased from the swindled amount. “We would advise people to be very alert with whom they talk to and befriend on social media. If you have been defrauded or have information of someone else being cheated, please inform the cyber police immediately,” said DCP (cyber) Rashmi Karandikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-duped-of-rs-1cr-with-yarns-of-death-kidnap-by-e-pals/articleshow/86692127.cms||Nitasha Natu

The party appealed to Sawant to protect the lives of children and not to put the state at risk. “I appeal to the chief minister to view every student as his child and decide to reopen schools with watertight safety measures,” senior Congress spokesperson Trajano D’Mello said. “During the closure of the schools, till date, the government has failed to inspect and support and aid the infrastructure that would be required to manage the SOPs at the time of opening.” The Congressman said that reports of 72 school students testing positive for Covid-19 in Karnataka has worried parents in Goa. “The chief minister as usual has shirked away from his responsibility and accountability by creating more confusion than clarity,” D’Mello said. He said that the government should have prepared the SOPs first before announcing resumption of classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ensure-safety-of-students/articleshow/86694301.cms||---

The dean of students has told the students’ union that the university authorities will consider waiving the sixth-semester fees but to avail of the facility, they would require a few documents. Students have to submit income certificate/s of guardian/s, signed by a government official, and a declaration of not availing of any financial help or scholarship.

The university authorities had issued a notice and instructed final-year students to clear their semester-VI fees or they would not get their grade cards. After students’ union protested, dean of students Arun Kumar Maiti mailed them on Friday evening, informing them the authorities would consider their appeal, but after verifying their documents.

MMC chairperson Damodar Kaskar assured that he will meet officials and plan the system in the town to streamline parking. The decision was taken at a special meeting of the council held recently. Councillor Vinod Palyekar said, “People park their vehicles anywhere they want and occupy the space sometimes for days unnecessarily. This is seen more in rental vehicles. The owners park their cars in the town and pick them up days later only when they have clients. This unnecessarily crowds the city and devoids others of using the parking lots,” he said, adding, “More than generating revenue, maintaining discipline is important in the town.” During the meeting, councillor Shami Salkar raised the issue of flaws in the restoration of the municipal building. Salkar said, “The municipal building is a heritage property and so it can be restored and not renovated. One cannot use any material in the work, there are certain guidelines to be followed. The municipality has overlooked all this.” Replying to this, Kaskar said that he will call upon GSUDA and other officials to discuss the work and to ask them to take corrective measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pay-parking-soon-in-vasco-town/articleshow/86694317.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Another pandemic batch starts college life, virtually in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Sreyashi Dutta organised all her marksheets and certificates and sat in front of her mobile phone, propped up for proper viewing, on Friday morning. The moment she had been waiting since the latter years of school arrived at 10am, when a professor appeared on the screen and greeted her and other students. Dutta finally stepped into her college life, but on screen. As first-semester undergraduate classes kicked off on Friday, flagging off a new academic session, Sanjay Chatterjee, a professor of physics, who had has inducted thousands of freshers earlier, felt, the buzz was missing. The usual scene of new, apprehensive faces and the excited chattering during breaks were replaced by single faces on screen, who waited for their turns to unmute their digital devices to introduce themselves. The pandemic restricted the campus buzz to virtual platforms. The usually bustling campuses of Lady Brabourne, Maulana Azad, Bethune, Scottish Church and Asutosh and many others wore a deserted look and the classrooms remained shut, contrary to the first-day scenes, when uncertain youngsters would wander around, looking for their new classrooms, half daunted and half excited about the campuses. Professors this time did not have to make any extra effort to draw the attention of the newbies, busy posting FB updates on first day at college. “I could not even see the faces of my classmates properly as they appeared tiny on the mobile screen. The first day of college is supposed to be a landmark event in a student’s life and friends we make on this day sometimes stay forever. But we were busy logging in and out, depending on the network,” said Sreyashi, a student at Bethune College. The first day in most colleges was reserved for orientation, when students were updated about the different departments, library, labs and online resources. Teachers also shared their timetables, syllabuses and students had to upload the copies of their marksheets and certificates. The experience was different for professors and principals as well. “We tried to interact with the students virtually, as much as we could. The firstday virtual class was perfect, and students also interacted well, but nothing can replace physical interactions,” said Chatterjee, a professor at Maulana Azad College. St Xavier’s College had started their first-year classes on September 11. Principal Father Dominic Savio said, “Online classes are going on perfectly, but students are really eager to visit the campus. They are missing their campus and we are also missing them.” The next objective of the colleges is to finish the syllabus on time. “We have a very short period of time to cover the full syllabus under CBCS. From the next class, we will start full-fledged online classes,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. Jogomaya Devi principal Sarbani Sarkar said, “We conducted the orientation programme on Thursday and will hold classes from Friday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-pandemic-batch-starts-college-life-virtually/articleshow/86692142.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The district administration has launched this pilot project in collaboration with Rizmaq Company as per state government’s direction in two village-Sangapur and Mukumpi of Gangavati taluk. The experts from Rizmaq are working with the district administration to improve the health condition of malnourished children, men and women in the villages. The fortified rice, which contains iron, zinc, Vitamin B12, and folic acid will be blended with regular rice supplied through PDS as well as with rice supplied for mid-day meal scheme and Anganwandi centres. Sameer Ahmed, founder of Rizmaq, told TOI that they have achieved a big success in the fortification of rice project at Gajapti district in Odisha. “Before launching our project, 68% of people in Gajapti were suffering from anaemic issues and iron deficiencies. Our five years of concerted efforts helped to bring down the number of people suffering from anaemia to 34%,” he added. “In Karnataka, we have chosen Koppal district since it is declared as one of worst affected district in terms of malnutrition. We have selected Sangapur and Mukumpi villages for our pilot project. We plan to work here for 3-6 months. Now, 58% are suffering from anaemia in these two villages,” he said. “We will blend fortified rice into regular rice supplied through PDS, and also serve rice in Anganwadi centres and also to the children covered under the mid-day meal scheme. This way, all men and women, including pregnant women will be served with regular rice blended with fortified rice,” he said. “Fortified rice is the science of combining essential micro-nutrients with rice flour and extruding rice kernels from that combination. It helps to increase iron and nutrition among the people who consume it daily. We blend one kg of fortified rice with 99 kg of regular rice. We are visiting each house and creating awareness on how this blended rice helps to improve their health,” he said. Koppal deputy Commissioner Suralkar Vikas Kishore said that Rizmac is implementing this project on an experimental basis. “After three months, our health experts will do a comparative study to know the results of consuming fortified rice and then we will submit a report to the state government. Depending on the results, we will decide to extend it to other parts of the district,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rice-fortification-project-in-koppal-to-tackle-malnutrition-and-anaemia/articleshow/86687880.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The move by panchayat comes after the order issued by the district collector asking resort authorities to demolish the check dams within one month was not implemented even as the deadline ended on Friday. The district collector had directed that if the resort authorities failed to implement the order, the grama panchayat secretary should take steps to demolish the check dams and the owners will be liable to meet the expenses. A team of officials and representatives of Koodaranji panchayat visited the check dams on Friday. Panchayat secretary O A Ansu said the panchayat will soon tender works for demolishing the check dams. He added that the resort authorities had drained water from the check dams. The high court had asked the district collector to take necessary action on the complaints that the check dams were obstructing the natural flow of water in a tributary of Iruvazhinji River. The court had issued the directive while acting on the petition filed by Kerala Nadi Samrakshana Samiti general secretary T V Rajan. The collector had appointed an expert panel in January to investigate the check dams and based on its report had ordered demolishing the check dams within one month. Meanwhile, Manjeri JFCM court directed the crime branch team probing the case against Anvar in connection with alleged cheating of an NRI businessman by promising partnership in a crusher business in Karnataka to submit the case diary on Oct 13. The crime branch had filed a report at Manjeri chief judicial magistrate court stating that there was prima facie evidence of cheating against Anwar as per the investigations conducted so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/panchayat-to-raze-illegal-check-dams/articleshow/86692189.cms||---

As per the application, work on the track, being made by reclaiming part of the lake, would damage and shrink the lake further and also cause more water pollution due to “environmentally harmful activities like clearing a forest, dumping debris, laying a tar road, etc”. The application, filed by environmental activist Stalin Dayanand and his NGO Vanashakti, seeks restoration of the water body. It states that the lake was built in 1891 as a source of potable water for Mumbai. The agencies to which the NGT issued its notice include Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, urban development department, state forest department, state pollution control board (MPCB), and the collector. Vanashakti’s senior counsel Gayatri Singh, with advocate Zaman Ali, said that in 2014, the water spread of Powai lake had decreased by 25%. They said the BMC in September was spraying an “environmentally harmful and possibly carcinogenic chemical, glyphosate, in Powai lake” allegedly to tackle the problem of weeds. The counsel said that on September 14, Dayanand complained to MPCB against the glyphosate spraying. Two days later, on MPCB’s directions, the spraying stopped. The Friday hearing was via video conferencing before the NGT’s western zone bench of Justice S Sathyarananan and expert member Arun Verma. The NGO said it made a representation to the authorities on August 19 to stop construction of the cycle track and again on August 23. But, it said, there was no response. In 2018, due to untreated sewage, pollution was very high and sample analysis in 2021 showed that pollution persisted, said its lawyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-govt-get-ngt-notice-on-powai-lake-cycling-track/articleshow/86692186.cms||Swati Deshpande

Though nobody has been arrested, NCB have launched a manhunt to trace the sender of the contraband, destined to Australia.Ephedrine, which is covered under NDPS Act, has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analogue having the methamphetamine structure. Because of the similarity, it can be used to create methamphetamine. This has made ephedrine highly sought-after in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. This is the sixth seizure of a consignment destined for Australia. NCB officials said there was a huge demand for synthetic drugs like Mephedrone, Methamphetamine and Ephedrine in Australia, and Mumbai was becoming a transit point. NCB, after a tip-off, raided the courier office and detained the parcel sourced from Hyderabad. The contraband was inside three mattresses packed in one box. The sender submitted a fake KYC while filling the courier form. Hyderabad NCB is tracking down the sender, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-5cr-drugs-for-australia-seized-from-mattresses/articleshow/86697350.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||Students’ care responsibility of all: Maharashtra education minister||PUNE: Educators participating in an online discussion with state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday on the reopening of schools from October 4 said that taking responsibility for the students and ensuring effective learning were priorities. Gaikwad said schools, teachers and every stakeholder must take every step possible to ensure that the institutions reopen safely. “However, once they reopen, it will be our responsibility to ensure that the children are safe. Even if there are Covid-19 cases, they need to be handled well by school authorities. Lessons from Hiware Bazar village (in Ahmednagar district) on handling Covid-19 need to be replicated across the state,” she said. Sarpanch of the Hiware Bazar village Popatrao Pawar was also part of the discussion. He said the village became Covid-free and started offline classes from standard I to X from June 15, and has been successfully doing it for three months. Pawar said, “We had the support of students and their parents. The parents were sensitised and slowly their reluctance changed to confidence and all the students started coming to school.” The online discussion was organised by the Maharashtra State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT). Member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 paediatric task force Samir Dalwai, said the education department must give a clear indication of the syllabus to the students and also ensure that exams are not conducted immediately. “The students should be given a minimum two weeks to adjust after a very long gap of homeschooling. They should not be pressured with exams immediately after joining school,” he said. They must be allowed to share their thoughts, mingle, meet and greet their friends and be given time to adjust, he added. Educator Hemangi Joshi said parents should not insist on vaccination at this point for children. If students have got used to screens and suddenly it is withdrawn from them, these situations should be handled well by the teachers, she added. Teachers would also need time to settle after joining offline schooling after nearly 18 months, and if they require counselling they should seek support, she said. Former director of education, Vasant Kalpande, said, “In the initial days, students should be given free time just to talk among themselves, express themselves and acclimatise to physical schooling. Let them talk about Covid-19, and if there are misconceptions, they should be cleared by teachers. In fact, getting rid of screens altogether is not going to be easy as it has now become a part of the system. So, if these devices are used under the guidance of teachers and parents, they would be a good source of learning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-care-responsibility-of-all-edu-minister/articleshow/86692153.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Kolkata||Need a dry week to repair roads ahead of Puja, says Hakim||Kolkata: Faced with the challenge of repairing roads before the Puja, which is less than a fortnight away, the KMC roads department put all hands to the task on Friday when the sun broke through the cloud cover, offering the elusive dry spell the civic team had been hoping for over nearly three weeks. Repair gangs were deployed on 143 arterial and major roads borough-wise to carry out patchwork, with a special focus on stretches leading to the city’s popular pandals. During a meeting with all essential departments on Friday, chairman of KMC board of administrators (BoA) Firhad Hakim instructed roads department officials to wrap up the patchwork by October 8. “Our road repair gangs have taken up a massive drive across the city. If they get seven days of dry spell, we hope to finish patchwork before the Pujas,” Hakim said. Of the 143 arterial roads, 133 belong to the KMC and the rest to different state and central agencies. But KMC will repair their portions as well, given the Pujas ahead. A roads department official said potholed portions of Chittaranjan Avenue, APC Roy Road, MG Road, Bidhan Sarani, College Street, Bowbazar Street, AJC Bose Road, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Tollygunge Circular Road, NSC Bose Road (Tollygunge), Subodh Mullick Road had been put on the priority list as their conditions had turned worse owing to the torrential rain last week. This apart, road repair gangs will also take up stretches of Diamond Harbour Road, Circular Garden Reach Road, Taratala Main Road, Canal (East) Road, belonging to state and central agencies. Traffic cops, who had listed 318 roads under ‘poor condition’ category, welcomed the repair decision. An officer said once the repairs were completed, the traffic flow would ease because potholes and battered portions slowed down the vehicles considerably. The cops are particularly keen on four arterial roads — EM Bypass, C R Avenue, Circular Garden Reach Road and Diamond Harbour Road. The road surface on both EM Bypass and CR Avenue have been able to battle the rain challenge better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/need-a-dry-week-to-repair-roads-ahead-of-puja-says-hakim/articleshow/86692194.cms||Saikat Ray

The court also urged schools to consider sympathetically the case of parents who were unable to pay the fees. It has also asked parents to file complaints if any against schools that attempt to levy more than the prescribed fees. A division bench, comprising Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice CT Ravi Kumar, gave the direction. TNN The bench gave the direction on Friday while disposing of the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the Progressive School Association and others. The top court has also asked the high court to consider the pending petition on the legality of the schools fee Act 2016 and hear the parties During the hearing, state’s additional advocate general (AAG) Manish Singhvi told the court that the interests of the parents should be protected and the students should be given relief. Association’s counsel Dinesh Yadav contended that the apex court had on May 3 asked private school operators to give 15% reduction in annual fees to students. “It was also said that under the 2016 fees Act, school operators can decide on the annual fees of children on the basis of the fees levied during the 2019-20 academic session and give 15% rebate on it. The court had also allowed to pay this fee in six equal instalments from February 8, 2021 to August 5, 2021. It had also said that in case of non-payment of fees, the school operator will neither remove a student's name nor prevent him from attending online or physical classes, nor withhold his result,” Yadav said. But even after SC directions, the parents have not paid the school fees within the prescribed period, though private school managements had cut school fees in compliance with the court order, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-lets-schoolstake-action-fornot-paying-fees/articleshow/86694380.cms||---

A small nocturnal primate, that attracts attention due to its two large, closely set brown eyes during the night, is facing danger on account of increased tree-felling and poaching. The state and central governments’ proposed infrastructural projects - highway expansion, railway double-tracking and power transmission line - in the protected as well as private forests of Mollem threatens the natural habitat of wild animals like the slender loris. Locally known as the ‘van manus’, this arboreal primate spends most of its life on the trees relishing on insects, leaves, flowers and sometimes eggs of birds. In the jungles of the Western Ghats of Goa, the slender loris faces a threat from poachers due to the misbelief that it’s call sounds like a cry and is considered unlucky, and hence the animal is often killed with a gunshot. Also, there are some poachers from Karnataka and Goa who have been involved in the trafficking of the primates by selling them for a high price. They are kept in a cage as pets. Gajanan Shetye, a wildlifer from Sattari, told TOI, “The slender loris is the least studied of primates about which many superstitions still prevail. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed them as endangered, whereas, in our country they are listed under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.” Though the slender loris is being sighted on various occasions in the forests of the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary of Mollem as well as private forests, very few locals are aware of their presence. When TOI contacted the range forest officer of Mollem, Sidhdesh Naik, he said, “We have decided to create awareness pertaining to the slender loris’ presence in our forested areas and their vulnerable status by highlighting their ecological role.” Besides the Mahavir Sanctuary and the Mollem National Park, the slender loris also has also been sighted in the Cotigao and Mhadei Sanctuaries. The slender loris is endemic to Southern India and Sri Lanka, and is presently facing threat due to habitat loss, electrocution on live wires, road accidents and illegal poaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/slender-loris-habitat-faces-threat-in-goa/articleshow/86694352.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Ahmednagar district had a daily positivity rate of 3.32% and reported 639 cases on Friday. Two days ago, it had the highest weekly positivity rate of 4.27% as against the state’s 2.11%. Patients from other districts have been coming to Pune for Covid treatment since the pandemic broke out last year for better healthcare. Many from the rural areas go to Sassoon as it is the nodal government hospital. Pawar said he had spoken to Ahmednagar’s collector Rajendra Bhosale and directed the authorities to follow strict containment measures. He also spoke to Nashik’s divisional commissioner since Ahmednagar falls under Nashik division. “Help for testing and other infrastructure to Ahmednagar will be provided by Pune district which has enough laboratories. The local administration in Ahmednagar has been told to take strict measures for containment and ensure that Covid-19 cases are attended to as early as possible. If a particular area is registering more cases, strict containment measures should be implemented there,”he added. Covid-19 cases have been increasing in Sangamner and Parner talukas in Ahmednagar district. Radhakrishna Game, divisional commissioner of Nashik division, told TOI that 1,000 samples from both these talukas will be sent to Pune. “We have been told to ensure adequate infrastructure is provided and patients are sent to Pune early,” he added. Ahmednagar’s collector Rajendra Bhosale told TOI that he had assured Pawar of adequate care locally, ramping up testing and sending samples to Pune, Nashik and Aurangabad. He added that there were nearly 700 cases being reported daily from Sangamner, Parner, Rahata and Shrigonda talukas in the district. “Since July, we have been carrying out 15,000 tests daily. With cases rising, we will increase it to 20,000. We have tied up with government laboratories in Pune, Nashik and Aurangabad,” he added. Parner and Shrigonda will send samples to Pune while Sangamner and Akole will send to Nashik and the rest will go to Aurangabad. As many as 110 villages where cases were up have been told to carry out self-imposed restrictions. “There will be strict monitoring of Covid protocols. Private doctors have been told to report all cases so that there is no delay in testing and treatment,” Bhosale added. Sugar factories have been told to conduct sero positivity survey to understand the positivity levels, local authorities have been told to be on the watch as zilla parishad and panchayat samiti elections are due, and people should avoid gatherings, he said. Pawar on Friday also directed the local administration to check for the areawise mapping of the remaining 60% patients at Sassoon hospital. Cases in Pune were falling, and the administration must reserve only one hospital for Covid care in Pune rural areas while the remaining must open for non-Covid treatment, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-cases-falling-40-patients-at-sassoon-from-ahmednagar-dy-cm/articleshow/86692191.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Goa cops bust another fake call centre targeting US citizens||CALANGUTE: Seven persons were arrested after Calangute police on Thursday busted a fake call centre that was allegedly used to cheat US citizens. Police said they received reliable information about the call centre, being operated from a hotel at Gauravaddo, Calangute, following which they raided it and arrested the seven, who were from different parts of India. This isn’t the first time Goa police have busted an illegal call centre operating with the specific aim of defrauding US citizens. On September 9, TOI reported that cops arrested 13 people operating a fake call centre from a hotel in Morjim, that also defrauded US citizens. Police said that in the Calangute case, the modus operandi of the persons was to obtain personal details of US citizens illegally by using VPN (virtual private networks). They would then contact the US citizens through an interactive voice response system by impersonating US law enforcement and social service officials. They would tell them they’ve committed illegal acts like fraud, drug peddling, etc, and ask them to settle the issue by paying them online using various modes like gift cards, target cards, Google Pay, as well as cryptocurrencies. The accused would later withdraw the money in Indian rupees at Ahmedabad. The seven have been identified as Mausam Kumar, 31, Jay Ruparel, 26, both from Gujarat, Jacky Senani, 23, from Thane, Arindam Lagachu, 19, from Arunachal Pradesh, Milon Hussain, 23, from Meghalaya, Techina Merak, 22, from Meghalaya and Sweta Raikwar, 19, from New Delhi. Police have attached 30 laptops, including a server laptop, 25 laptop chargers, 24 headphones, two routers with adapters, and mobile phones, all worth Rs 20 lakh, which were being used to operate the fake call centre. Calangute police registered an offence under Sections 419, 420, 384 read with 34 of the IPC, and Sections 66-C, 66-D of IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-bust-another-fake-call-centre-targeting-us-citizens/articleshow/86694379.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Cabinet rejig soon? Digvijay Singh in Jaipur, meets CM Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot||JAIPUR: Senior Congress functionary and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijay Singh, who was in the city for a day on Friday, separately met top four state politicians of the party — chief minister Ashok Gehlot, assembly Speaker CP Joshi, PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot. Even as Singh claimed his visit was strictly to highlight the Centre’s failures and refused to take questions related to the turmoil in the Rajasthan Congress, political observers believe that senior politicians discussed state politics, including the Pilot camp’s long-pending demand for cabinet expansion and reshuffle. Political developments in neighbouring Punjab, where Captain Amarinder Singh was “humiliated” into resigning as chief minister, have brought national focus on Rajasthan too, where Gehlot and Pilot are locked in a tussle. Addressing a press conference here, Singh complained that the media hailed the recent change of Gujarat CM as a BJP masterstroke but when the same was done in Punjab, it was called Congress infighting. Singh held a long discussion with Gehlot at the chief minister’s residence in the afternoon. Thereafter he went to Joshi’s residence and held talks with him. Earlier in the day, Pilot and Dotasra paid visits to Singh at the Khasa Kothi. A couple of ministers, MLAs and party leaders also met Singh. His visit has come at a time when Punjab PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajasthan’s BSP-turned-Congress legislators have spelled fresh trouble for the Congress central leadership. Four of the six turncoat legislators from Rajasthan are in New Delhi, apparently miffed at the leadership for ignoring their legal and political needs for long. These legislators are struggling to save their assembly memberships in the Supreme Court, where the BSP has sued them under the anti-defection law. Besides legal assistance, the six MLAs have been expecting to be inducted in the state government for boosting the Congress strength from 100 to 106 in the 200-member assembly. The six are, however, facing stiff resistance from the Pilot camp, which wants its own members in the council of ministers as well as in state commissions and boards. Under these circumstances, Singh was seen by the Congress workers as the central leadership’s emissary. It is believed that the long-pending demands for cabinet and PCC rejigs as well as political appointments in the state would be met during the Navratri beginning October 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cabinet-rejig-soon-digvijay-in-city-meets-gehlot-pilot/articleshow/86694413.cms||---

The central agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate, have been tracking his movements seeking his presence before the investigating officers in a money laundering case against ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh. Singh was summoned by the ED last month for questioning, but the former Mumbai police commissioner had expressed his inability on health grounds. Sources said Singh may be hiding somewhere in the country as he had a look out notice pending against him and was kept on a watch list at all airports.  “There is no chance he would have skipped the immigration authorities had he tried to leave the country, unless he had taken the land route to Nepal to flee,” a senior official pointed out. The ED is also likely to file a separate case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act against Singh based on an FIR registered by Mumbai police against him. His former boss and ex-home minister Deshmukh has also gone underground and evaded repeated summons from the ED. Deshmukh’s arrest is imminent, said sources, as he has exhausted all his legal options and a court has also directed him to surrender and present before the ED.  Singh went underground after a warrant was issued against him for his failure to ap commission constituted by the Maharashtra government to probe his allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.

The RSAB has 20 lakh digital land records and has opened a special kiosk to provide copies of the documents to the potential beneficiaries. A resident of Bikaner, Ram Singh could have never imagined seeing or touching the document given to his great grandfather in 1899 by the then revenue record officer of the princely state of Bikaner. “The document would not only help in settling the family dispute over the property but would also give us an opportunity to register the property named after the legal owners,” said Singh.Singh is not alone and many are queuing up at the RSAB kiosk, looking for the documents since the state has announced to access land deeds and further register their property by paying a nominal fee. It is like a dream come true for many. The state has announced to grant 10 lakh land deeds from October 2 to March 31. Almost 70 to 80 people are coming for documents, and the RSAB officials feel that the numbers will swell in hundreds once the campaign is known to all. Vickam Bajoriya, a resident of Ratangarh in Churu, has collected the chain of documents of a mansion he had purchased from the original owner in 2000. “The mansion was recorded in documents in 1901 and was purchased by me in 2000. When I heard of the programme, I approached the real owners for the first document of the property which they didn’t have. Finally, I was told that it will be available at RSAB. I am fortunate that in a matter of 2 to 3 hours, I got the copy of the document that RSAB procured from the records of the then revenue officer in Churu,” said Bajoriya, who will now apply for the lease deed of his property. The state has made a special provision that documents collected from the RSAB will be considered valid before law. “I am glad that documents collected by the RSAB of all erstwhile princely states till 1953 are now providing them the ownership of their title,” said Mahendra Khadgawat, director of RSAB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-rush-to-bikaner-archives-to-get-land-records-issued-by-erstwhile-rulers/articleshow/86694454.cms||---

Addressing the citizens through Facebook live on Thursday, Pandey said “We got a Detailed Project Report (DPR) worth Rs 1,000 crore approved for the Smart City project in Aurangabad. In this, the centre has a share of Rs 500 crore and state and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation have a share of Rs 250 crore each. We should understand that for any project to sustain, we must keep separate funds for operation and maintenance.” He pointed out that many important projects have failed as there were no separate funds for operation and maintenance. “It may appear that the funds are available but they are allocated to key projects like the Majhi Smart Bus, the Master System Integrator and the Safari Park project. We are working to ensure that these projects sustain,” Pandey said. He said that it is equally important for the citizens to act responsibly towards the development of the city. While basic amenities of the city are being taken care of, the city should now think of next level of development. Pandey said that the ASCDCL is implementing the Master System Integrator (MSI) project. Under this project, 700 CCTV cameras have been installed at key junctions across the city. The live feed and footage of these cameras can be viewed at the Command and Control Centre situated at the police commissionorate premises.

While launching the Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, which aims to make cities and towns garbage free, the PM said, “Puriji, when I speak about getting rid of heaps of garbage, there is such a mountain in Delhi, which has been here for years. This hill is also waiting for its removal.” Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri was also at the event. Ghazipur landfill site falls under East Delhi Municipal Corporation. Different government agencies have tried to find solution to the mountain of garbage dump at Ghazipur in East Delhi, but there has been no major success so far. On the progress of processing of municipal solid waste, Modi said currently around one lakh tonnes of solid waste is being processed. “In 2014, less than 20% of the waste was processed. Today we are processing about 70% of daily waste. Now, we have to take it to 100%,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm-remove-ghazipur-mountain-of-garbage/articleshow/86692315.cms||Dipak K Dash

And, as in Pilot’s birthday celebrations, corona guidelines were completely ignored in Dotasra’s celebration too. Music and dance programmes by local artists were organised at a couple of places. Districts units too observed the PCC chief’s birthday.In fact, the celebrations began a day earlier when Dotasra cut a cake in his hometown Sikar in the presence of local MLAs, leaders and party workers Thursday evening.On Friday, hundreds of party workers, besides several ministers, MLAs and senior party leaders, congratulated Dotasra on a stage erected outside the Congress state headquarters here on Friday. Leaders from Pilot camp too were present to wish the party state president. Congress senior leader Digvijay Singh, who was in Jaipur, too offered cake to Dotasra.Dotasra was made the PCC chief in the aftermath of Pilot’s rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s leadership last year. In the past 14 months since then, this was the first time Dotasra demonstrated his hold over the party workers. His loyalists were already counting him among leaders with mass support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dotasra-celebrates-57th-birthday-with-show-of-strength/articleshow/86694489.cms||---

However, when researchers matched the leopard’s rosette pattern — the imprint of the spots on its hide — with pictures of the ‘attacker’ animal that had been clicked earlier this week, the researchers realised that the one that had walked into the cage was not the same one that they suspected had carried out the recent attacks. “The leopard that was caught this morning is the sibling of the leopard that is suspected to have caused the attacks. It is also a female leopard,” said Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests. “Researchers are still working on matching the leopard with past pictures to confirm the finding.” On Monday, the wildlife team was returning after laying camera traps when they saw a leopard charging towards at least two people walking at Aarey Colony around 8.15pm. The team waited for some time and were able to click the picture of the leopard. The picture clicked by the researcher was matched with past pictures from Aarey and it matched with that of one of the leopards. Based on these findings, permission has been granted to capture/tranquillise the leopard, said Limaye. On Thursday evening, cages had been placed in conflict areas where the leopard had attacked human beings. The leopard walked into a cage near Unit No. 3 at Aarey Colony and was trapped. It was transferred to the rescue centre at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). The trapped leopard, approximately 4 years old, was examined by Dr S Pethe, assistant commissioner, wildlife, SGNP. It had no injuries and is healthy. Officials said that the captured leopard will be held at the centre and its surroundings observed for any more attempts to attack humans. This would further confirm that the leopard being held captive is not the culprit. “Our efforts are on to catch the suspect leopard. Once it is caught, this leopard [the one in the cage] will be released into the wild,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-leopard-walks-into-trap-cage-but-could-be-attackers-sibling/articleshow/86697351.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Jaipur||‘No faith in NIA, Mundra drug seizure be probed by judge’||Jaipur: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, who was sent to Jaipur by the Congress on Friday, hit out at the Modi government focusing on the national investigation agency (NIA) and businessman Gautam Adani. Audio of an alleged drug peddler was played before the media to claim that BJP leaders were indulging in immoral business of drugs.The Rajya Sabha MP said Congress has no faith in NIA under the BJP government. Singh said, “NIA investigated cases like Ajmer Dargah, Samjhauta Express, Mecca Masjid and Malegaon blasts. The result was that the Modi-Shah government got all the accused freed through the NIA.” He said BJP acts against its political rivals through ED and IB but when the same rivals join the saffron party, they are freed of all charges.Addressing a press conference at the PCC headquarters, Singh raised the issue of heroin seized at the Adani group-run Mundra port on September 13 and alleged that narcotics worth about Rs 2-lakh crores have been seized from this port twice in a month. “Drugs worth Rs 21000-cr were caught by the central investigating agencies alone,” the Congress leader said. He added, “Strict action was taken against Bollywood people found possessing 200 grams to 300 grams drugs, but on finding 3000-kg drugs, the investigation was simply handed over to NIA.”Singh demanded that instead of the NIA, the investigation into heroin seizure should be done by a sitting or a retired Supreme Court judge under the supervision of the apex court. “The investigating officer should be appointed by a committee, which should include the leader of opposition,” said Singh.Targeting the RSS, Singh claimed the organization was not registered till date. “When an organization is not registered, it cannot even have memberships. In such a situation, they cannot even have an account either. Then in which account does the guru dakshina (donations) go?” he asked. At the same time, Singh thanked union home minister Amit Shah for helping him during the ‘Narmada Yatra’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-faith-in-nia-mundra-drug-seizure-be-probed-by-judge/articleshow/86694478.cms||---

---||Delhi||Alone in pandemic, tech rescues elderly in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Till a few months ago, Manmeet Kaur struggled with loneliness at home with her family all living abroad. Then, her son arrived in India after the lockdown and helped her reconnect with friends and family over the internet. The 76-year-old woman’s doctor testifies to the change in her before and after she picked up digital skills. “She now attends Zoom meetings we regularly organise for senior citizens and has become more expressive about her health issues. She has also made friends with people she met on online meetings,” said Dr Grewal, senior consultant for elder care at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute. While surveys and reports have reinforced the importance of bridging the digital divide and generation gap, António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, recently called for more inclusive policies, strategies and actions to achieve digital equality among people of all ages. “Digital Equality for All Ages” was accordingly the theme of this year’s International Day of Older Persons on October 1. “Staying connected with loved ones; attending a religious service; taking a stance. All these actions and many more are increasingly carried out online, especially as individuals and communities grapple with restrictions imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As we face the challenge of navigating our world’s growing reliance on technology, perhaps no population could benefit more from support than older persons,” said Guterres. Elderly communities without a grasp of the latest technology are indeed at risk of being left behind, confirmed Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director, Ujala Cygnus Hospital. “We have to ensure that the digital gap is filled so that the older adults can also live freely at a time when the country is undergoing a digital revolution,” said Bajaj. “Tailormade smartphones can play an important role in easing elderly people’s transition into the digital space. Phones with big buttons, larger font size and high-volume speakers are the need of the hour.” Agewell Foundation founder Himanshu Rath said a survey they conducted in August-September among 10,000 senior citizens revealed a significant increase in a sense of loneliness and isolation among them. “A miniscule percentage of old people are digitally literate and are self-conscious about it. This is widening the gap between the generations and leading to an uncomfortable undercurrent within the four walls of almost every family across the country,” Rath said. National and international evidence has it that older people are not only socially isolated due to the pandemic, but also depressed because of health or unaddressed health issues. A few of them are still struggling to visit hospitals, pointed out Dr Prasun Chatterjee, additional professor, geriatric medicine, AIIMS. Chatterjee said that teleconsultation for older people started in AIIMS in June 2020 during the early stage of the Covid outbreak. But digital illiteracy, vision problems, hearing issues, increased reaction time are significant roadblocks for availing this facility. “It is the responsibility of children and grandchildren to abolish the myth of the digital divide of elderly people,” Chatterjee added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/alone-in-pandemic-tech-rescues-elderly/articleshow/86692342.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Local residents said over 50 bikers fell on the slippery road opposite the Dharmashala on Thursday, a day after the incessant rain and the heavy discharge from the Gangapur dam left the Godavari flooded. The road opposite the Dharmashala got submerged on Wednesday. As the water started receding from Thursday, the bikers started taking the road and accidents were frequent. Anand Londe, a resident of the Dharmashala area, said, “People should understand that riding a bike on the road in such a condition is impossible.” A shopkeeper in the area said, “When the riverwater overflows ,the road and the compound get submerged. But when the water recedes, the mud remains behind. This makes the road dangerous for all. This has become an annual affair.” As the skies opened up on Friday morning, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) deployed workers to clear mud from the road. But as it started raining again in the evening, the situation worsened. Local corporator Shahu Khaire said, “We have instructed the officials to resolve the issue at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/road-opposite-dharmashala-trust-a-bikers-nightmare-every-time-godavari-overflows/articleshow/86688083.cms||Santosh Sonawane

From Saturday, CNG will cost Rs. 47.48 per kg in Delhi and Rs. 53.45 per kg in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. The increase in CNG prices is bound to evoke demand for higher tariffs from bus, taxi and auto operators. But IGL said the per-km impact on running cost of vehicles will be negligible and CNG would still offer more than 60% savings against petrol and diesel at their current prices. The price of CNG supplied by the company will cost Rs 55.81 per kg in Gurgaon, Rs 56.50 in Rewari, Rs 54.70 per kg in Karnal and Kaithal, Rs 60.71 in Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Shamli, Rs 63.97 in Kanpur, Fatehpur and Hamirpur and Rs 62.41 in Ajmer. It said the increase would have a marginal impact on the per-km running cost of vehicles. For autos, the increase would be 6 paisa per km, for taxis it would be 11 paisa per km and in case of buses, the increase would be Rs 1.65 per km. PNG to the households in Delhi will cost Rs. 33.01 per unit, up from Rs. 30.91. PNG will cost Rs 32.86 per unit for households in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. In Rewari and Karnal, the new rate will be Rs 31.81 per scm, while in Gurgaon it will be Rs 31.20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-gas-rates-go-up-hike-in-cng-png-prices/articleshow/86692456.cms||---

The seeds strewn by drones will be monitored by Seedcopter’s platform for the next 10 years with the help of satellite images and other technologies available. “Drone planting plays a major role in planting trees in dense forests and hilly terrain where human beings are unable to reach to plant more trees. We will also be approaching other states in India to take up planting,” he said, adding that Marut Drones has been conducting experiments by spraying seed balls in diverse terrains across India such as Udaipur in Rajasthan, Kaziranga National Park in Assam and Uttarakhand for a couple of years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/marut-drone-kicks-off-drone-plantation-drive-in-t/articleshow/86692765.cms||---

He did not know swimming and had entered the water at a point where depth had increased by nearly 15 feet due to recent digging for desilting by municipal staff, officials said. Rescue operation was on to find the body. Chaderghat cops said that Mohammed Jahangir (35), a cook, entered Musi around 10 am and waded deep into the water unaware of the depth. Jahangir’s home in Shankar Nagar slum is close to the Musi. “The family was nearby when the incident took place. The information that he drowned while attending nature’s call is wrong. He himself got into the water to swim, though he do not how to swim,” Chaderghat SI P Babu said. By the time cops reached the spot after being alerted by the family, Jahangir had disappeared in the water. Cops said locals often entered the water to play as the slum was along the Musi. In the past, cops had set up a picket to stop people from getting in the water. Due to the recent heavy rains, the flow in Musi was strong, cops said. Both Chaderghat and Kachiguda police were searching for him in coordination with GHMC. Officials said that they were making efforts to rope in the NDRF in the search operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-washed-away-by-current-in-musi/articleshow/86692634.cms||---

The apex body for trade and industry in Saurashtra urged the government to stop collecting ‘mask’ fines from the violators in order to stop harassment of common people. While medical professionals across the globe advocate use of mask to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the trade body has made a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Bhupendra Patel asking for lifting of the compulsory mask rule. In its letter the trade body has stated that Covid is totally in control in the state. The letter also quotes the AIIMS director Randeep Guleria recent statement about there being very less chance of a third wave of Covid-19 in India. The letter also states that a sizable population in the state has been vaccinated and the numbers of new positive cases are negligible. It states that looking at the current scenario, wearing a mask for an entire day could prove harmful for health. People don’t get to breathe fresh air because of the masks and this may lead to other illnesses, it states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-trade-body-wants-masks-out/articleshow/86691218.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Disha case: Hackers tried to access laptop of Supreme Court probe panel?||HYDERABAD: High drama unfolded on Friday after unknown persons tried to remotely access the laptop used by Supreme Court-appointed inquiry commission probing the alleged encounter of four accused in the Disha rape and murder case. The attempts came even as the commission was recording statements of officials during a hearing. At least two such attempts were made by two IDs - ‘IT Cell-SDNR’ and ‘CID’ leading to a suspicion that someone was trying to hack into the commission’s database. The IT team immediately alerted the commission’s secretary S Sasidhar Reddy who informed the Telangana high court. The commission’s chairman, Justice (retd) V S Sirpurkar also asked the state counsel, Uma Maheshwara Rao, to verify details of the IDs and find out why they were accessing the laptop. The Supreme Court had appointed the commission after the four men, accused of raping and murdering a young veterinary doctor on the outskirts of Hyderabad, were killed in an alleged police encounter in December 2019. After the attempted intrusion came to light, the commission’s secretary checked with the state police’s liaison officer, who said some of the police department officials may have tried to access their unit database from the network of the commission. The IT team, however, told the secretary that the persons who tried to obtain access to the laptop could have done so only if they knew that particular laptop’s ID. The laptop hosts the video conferencing platform through which everyone logs in. Justice Sirpurkar has been attending the hearings from Nagpur, while members, Rekha Sondur Baldota and D R Karthikeyan have been joining in from Mumbai and Delhi. One of the commission's advocates, K Parameshwaran, has been logging in from Delhi, while the second counsel, Virupaksha Dattatreya Gouda, has been directly appearing before the commission from high court, along with the secretary, state counsel, other advocates and the deponents. As the computers and IT staff used by the commission were provided by the Telangana high court, the secretary informed the registrar general and registrar (IT) of the court about the intrusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hackers-tried-to-access-laptop-of-sc-probe-panel/articleshow/86694574.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Delhi||Fewer coal plants and more EVs may cut pollution load in 20 years: Study||NEW DELHI: A substantial reduction in premature deaths can be witnessed if electric vehicles are adopted at a steady rate till the year 2040. This has been revealed in a report released by International Council on Clean Transportation, which analysed the health impacts and reduction in emissions for switching over to electric vehicles. The report, “Understanding the air quality and health impacts of large-scale vehicle electrification in India”, also found that there could be a reduction in the pollution load if this approach was done simultaneously with a coal phaseout, thereby reducing India’s reliance on this sector to generate electricity. The assumption in the study included a number of scenarios that could play out over the next two decades. The baseline scenario was of around 1% of the total vehicle sales in 2020 being electric vehicles (EV) and this share holding steady till 2040. It was also assumed that the reliance on coal went down to around 15% in 2040. In the second “ambitious EV” scenario, it was assumed that the share of new electric vehicle sales would increase from 1% in 2020 to 67% in 2030 and 95% in 2040. However, they would be no new policies to decarbonise the power sector or tighten emissions with additional demand to be supplied by coal and gas plants. A third combined scenario took into consideration the ambitious pathway assumptions, while simultaneously assuming that coal plants were phased out. Large-scale electrification under the “ambitious EV” scenario alone could lead to health benefits, with around 13,300 and 16,700 annual premature deaths avoided in 2030 and 2040, respectively. In the combined scenario, around 31,500 premature deaths could be avoided by 2030 and 70,400 by 2040. Currently, the power and transport sectors account for around 65% of anthropogenic NOx emissions, 12% of primary PM2.5 emissions, and 55% of SO2 emissions in 2040. The study noted if the ambitious electrification target was met and there were no policy interventions, emissions could increase to 75%, 14%, and 58%, respectively, for the three pollutants. However, reduction could be achieved by phasing out power plants alongside electrification of vehicles. “We find considerable aggregate reductions for all pollutants in the more ambitious power sector emission reduction scenario. PM2.5 emissions from the power and transport sectors combined are 22% less in 2040 under the combined scenario compared with the baseline. For SO2, NOx and CO2, reductions could be around 85%, 29% and 40%, respectively, by 2040 in the combined scenario compared with the baseline,” the report stated. Mukesh Sharma, professor at IIT-Kanpur and one of the co-authors of the study, said there was a need to work on not only implementing electric vehicles, but also ensuring stringent emission controls at power plants as well as their decarbonisation in a phased manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fewer-coal-plants-and-more-evs-may-cut-pollution-load-in-20-yrs-says-study/articleshow/86692481.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Twelve days after the duo was booked, the cops are trying to ascertain if Jain and Bhatt were in contact as alleged by the girl in her complaint. The police said that Bhatt, who was arrested three days ago, has denied being in contact with Jain. “He keeps claiming that he doesn’t know Jain but we are verifying it. They both are well-known citizens so it’s not possible that they don’t know each other. Also, we have some circumstantial evidence linking both,” said a senior police official. Interestingly, Jain too, in his letter written to the state DGP claimed that he has no idea who Bhatt was. The 24-year-old law student, who has accused duo of raping her, has told the police that it was Jain who introduced her to Bhatt. She had said that she met Jain five months ago when she went to his office for training. She claimed that Jain introduced her to Bhatt during a discussion of a multi-crore deal. “We will get a complete idea of the crime sequence once Jain is nabbed,” the police said. The cops haven’t been able to trace Jain who disappeared on September 20, a day after he was booked for rape by Gotri police. On Friday, the cops took Jain to three separate places where he had met the girl. The police did reconstruction of the crime at the three properties including a hotel room. Since his arrest, Bhatt has maintained his statement that the relations between him and the girl were consensual. She, though, has stated in her FIR that it was Jain who first spiked her drink and molested her. He then visited her residence later and raped her. Bhatt too has been accused of raping and threatening the girl.

---||Delhi||Delhi University: 98% cutoff mark for major science courses||NEW DELHI: Apart from three colleges requiring 100% to pursue the BSc physics and computer science (H) degree courses, several other science courses also saw a spike in the first cut-off marks for undergraduate admissions announced by Delhi University on Friday. The qualifying mark for courses like BSc (H) in physics, chemistry and mathematics was above 98% in many colleges. While most institutions pegged the cutoff at 1-2% higher than last year, Bhaskaracharya College opted for a steeper rise in physics (H), with the requirement going up from 93% last year to 97.33%. Statistics (H) hovered at the higher end of cutoffs ranging from 98% to 99.25%, the highest being at Hindu College at 99.5%. A total of nine colleges in the university offer the BSc (H) course in statistics. The lowest was 94% at Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences of Women.  While both Kirori Mal College and Lady Shri Ram College for Women set the bar for BSc statistics at 99.25%, it was 99% at Sri Venkateswara College. Those applying for BSc (H) statistics at Mata Sundri College, Ram Lal Anand College and Ramanujan College will need to have scored 98% to get admission, those applying at Ramjas College require 98.75%. The cutoff at Mata Sundri represented a big hike of nearly 6% over last year’s qualifying point, though most other colleges only posted a 1-2% rise in the statistics cutoff. Sciences course were expected to have high cutoffs. Expectedly, at Hansraj, nine of the 12 science courses on offer, set the bar at 99% and above. While those desiring to pursue a BSc (H) in physics need to have aggregated 99.66%, courses like BSc (H) in chemistry, geology, electronics, mathematics and zoology demanded a 99% aggregate as did BSc (Programme) physical sciences with chemistry and BSc (Programme) physical sciences with computer science. Hansraj has set a 100% cutoff for BSc (H) in computer science. Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College similarly asked for the perfect score for the BSc (H) computer science course. The same course also had a high cutoff at Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College at 98.75% and at Dyal Singh College and Ramanujan College at 98%. Gyantosh Jha, principal, Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, said, “These increases in cutoff marks were expected as students have obtained very high marks in their Class XII board examinations this year. We will get to know the exact number of students who are applying to our college once the admission process begins from Monday.” Sanjay Batra, admission convener at Sri Venkateswara, said that in the data provided by the university to the colleges after registration, there was no clarity on the number of students who had applied for sciences and commerce. “The moment a student registers, he or she selects all the subjects. Suppose there are 350 students with 100% marks. We do not know how many of them will opt for commerce, science or arts courses,” said Batra. “Last year, there were over-admissions in several colleges and so this time, all institutions are cautious and setting high cutoffs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/98-cutoff-mark-for-major-science-courses/articleshow/86692504.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Erode||Heavy rain wreaks havoc in Namakkal, Erode districts||COIMBATORE: Heavy rain lashed Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode and Namakkal districts in western Tamil Nadu on Friday. Agricultural fields were inundated, streets were flooded and a few houses were damaged in Erode and Namakkal districts. What started as a drizzle, accompanied by incessant lightening around 3am on the day, soon grew into a heavy rain in Tiruchengode, Pallipalayam and surrounding areas in Namakkal district. The downpour continued for the next four hours without a break, inundating low-lying areas and agricultural fields. Rainwater gushed into houses at Suriyampalayam in Tiruchengode and Kootapalli Colony. Government authorities had to disconnect power supply to the affected localities to prevent untoward incidents. Fire and rescue services personnel and local body staff were deployed and they along with the residents pumped out the water from the houses. Officials said the rainwater had entered the houses at Pallipalayam as well. Traffic also came to a halt on many roads at Pallipalayam because of waterlogging. Pallipalayam bus stand was closed and uses from Erode to Salem via Pallipalayam were diverted through other routes. At least four tiled roof houses were damaged in rain-related calamities on Muniappan Kovil Street at Suriyampalayam in the district. However, no one was injured. While there was respite from the rain during the day, rainwater did not recede from residential areas. Namakkal collector Shreya P Singh said the revenue and municipal administration staff were taking efforts to drain the rainwater from roads and residential localities. “We have evacuated residents from 10 houses and moved them to a relief camp in a school. We have arranged food for them.” The collector also inspected the flood-hit areas. She found that storm water drains were blocked at several places and there were encroachments at two places on water channels that hindered the flow of rainwater, resulting in flooding. She has ordered the officials to remove the encroachments immediately. At Gobichettipalayam in Erode district, paddy that was stocked for procurement by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation was drenched, sparking fear among the farmers that they would go waste. Farmers said the paddy harvest was underway on 24,000 acres at Gobichettipalayam. The state government had opened more than 20 procurement centres in the locality, where the harvested paddy was kept in the open. Paddy kept at 10 such centres, including the ones at Nanjagoundanpalayam and Polavakkalipalayam, was drenched in the rain, the farmers said. They have to now take the paddy back, dry and bring them back at an additional expenditure. Tirupur district too received incessant rainfall and several stretches were inundated. While Coimbatore was spared from the heavy rain in the earlier part of the day, it gathered force in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/heavy-rain-wreaks-havoc-in-namakkal-erode-districts/articleshow/86699120.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CM K Chandrasekhar Rao moots ‘green fund’ for tree plantation in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has proposed a novel ‘green fund’ for the success of Haritha Haram and for taking up the tree plantation programme continuously in the state. In this endeavour, he proposes to include every stakeholder like lawmakers, IAS and IPS officers, employees, students and traders. Announcing this during a short discussion on Haritha Haram in the assembly on Friday, the CM said he had spoken to elected representatives, bureaucrats and government employees who have come forward to contribute some amount every month for the proposed green fund. “While elected MLAs, MLCs and MPs will contribute Rs 500 a month, IAS and IPS officers have come forward to contribute Rs 100,” KCR said. State government employees have also expressed their readiness to contribute Rs 25 a month. TRS Rajya Sabha MP J Santosh Kumar said he would contribute Rs 5,000 a month for the proposed fund. The CM also appealed to the lawmakers belonging to opposition parties to contribute to the fund. KCR said 10% of funds from constituency development would go towards the green fund. He said there was a proposal to charge 0.1% on government contract works, which will be collected by R&B department and Rs 1,000 for all government licences and renewals. “I am proposing to collect Rs 1,000 during renewal of licences such as wine shops, Rs 50 per transaction during property registrations, collection of a nominal amount ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 100 during schools, colleges and university admissions. While the charges are Rs 5 for primary schools, it will be Rs 100 for professional college students,” the CM said. He hoped the proposed green fund would be a role model to other states. Claiming that Haritha Haram, which was taken up six years ago, was a huge success, the CM said of the total 130 crore saplings’ plantation target outside the forest areas, the government had completed 76 crore saplings’ plantation, including 14 crore in HMDA and GHMC limits. As against 100 crore saplings’ plantation within the forest areas, 60 crore saplings’ plantations had been completed. For the programme, the government had spent Rs 6,556 crore, he said. On green development programme in gram panchayats and habitations, KCR claimed probably for the first time, every gram panchayat and habitation covering about 13,000 acres in 19,000 villages and habitations ‘Palle Prakruthi Vanalu’ were developed. Similarly, for promotion of greenery in mandals, ‘Bruhat Prakruthi Vanalu’ were developed with a variety of plants in 526 mandals. He said 109 urban parks were being developed in the city and surrounding areas. Sharing his experience when he was Siddipet MLA in 1980s, KCR said he had to struggle to get 10,000 plants for Siddipet town. “While I was able to procure some from erstwhile HUDA, some saplings were brought from Kadiyam nursery. Now, every village has a nursery,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-moots-green-fund-for-tree-plantation-in-t/articleshow/86694615.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nashik||Nashik: 15 students in a class, only vaccinated staff in school||NASHIK: A maximum of 15 students in one classroom, close monitoring of health of each student for initial one week, use of thermal scanners, allowing only fully vaccinated teachers and staff. These are some of the measures schools in Nashik city and rural areas have to follow to reopen physical classes from October 4. They are part of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) jointly issued by the education departments of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nashik rural for reopening schools. While in rural areas, the schools from Class 5 – 7 are reopening, in the urban areas, the schools for only classes 8 – 12 are reopening. In rural areas, the schools for classes 8 – 12 are already functioning. Education officer (secondary) of zilla parishad Pushpavati Patil and administrative officer of NMC Sunil Dhangar have instructed the school authorities to give details of schools, its area, the number of students and contact numbers of the nearest health centres. The officer has also instructed the school authorities to keep their contact numbers so that the help from the health centres can be taken in case of an extreme emergency. The SOPs further have pointed out that authorities should ensure there is no overcrowding in any of the schools by any chance and at the same time, the parents must duly sign and give their consent letter to the school administration before the schools begin. Each class can have at the most 15 students, with one student on one bench. If the number is more, additional classrooms may be taken. But if the classrooms are not available, then the schools may be conducted in two sessions – each in forenoon and the afternoon period. The officer also pointed out that the offline schools will deal with core subjects like Maths, Science and English on priority. Hence, only teaching and non-teaching staff who are completely vaccinated should be allowed to come in contact with the students. The schools authorities have also been asked to keep a close watch on the health of the students, their uneasiness and time taken to adapt to the new system. The department has asked the school authorities to carry out the sanitisation of schools and install facilities for regular hand wash facilities for the students. There are 223 schools for Class 8 to 12 in Nashik city that have 1.10 lakh students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/15-students-in-a-class-only-vaccinated-staff-in-school/articleshow/86688193.cms||Abhilash Botekar

He told the workers at Kamshet in Maval on Friday that the three parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government were constantly fighting with each other. “If one studies the constant bickering of two parties in the alliance, it is clear elections are likely anytime. When it happens, we have to ensure our party candidate is elected from Maval,” he said. The proposed Development Plan of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority, he warned, was nothing but a ploy against interests of small farmers and residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ashish-shelar-predicts-that-state-polls-due-any-time/articleshow/86692495.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali’s aide blames her for converting trust into company||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali’s aide Saeed Khan has blamed her for fraudulently converting Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan, a trust that had assets of around Rs 70 crore, to a non-profit organisation allegedly with the aim of siphoning off funds, ED sources said. Khan said Gawali was handling the entire affairs of the trust. The trust had 11 members, but after converting it as a company, Saeed Khan and Gawali’s mother Shalini became its directors. Thus, the two got complete control of the trust and its various assets worth Rs 69 crore. Gawali is MP from Yavatmal-Washim. The ED alleged that Gawali, through her aide Saeed Khan and his accomplices, have criminally conspired to convert the trust into a non-profit organisation through forgery and fraud. Khan stated that he became a director in the trust on the insistence of Gawali and all the decisions were taken by her. He resigned from the directorship in August. Saeed told the ED officials that he was unaware about the fraudulent NOCs procured from the public institutions, and Gawali would be aware of the same as she was president of the trust. The trust was converted into a non-profit company under Section 8 of the Companies Act allegedly by forging signatures of the management and NOCs from public institutions. The ED produced Saeed before the special court on Friday. The court extended his custody till Tuesday. The ED has summoned Gawli in the case on Monday to record her statement. The ED alleged that Gawali, along with Khan and others, conspired to siphon off the trust money and filed a false police case against a former office- bearer of the trust. In his remand application, the ED stated that when they asked Khan about details of the trust, he said that he was unaware about it. Bhawana Gawali was the signing authority and he was unaware of the day-to-day management of the newly-formed company, he said. The ED informed the court that Khan has not provided the required information regarding the proceeds of crime. In his statement to the ED, Khan said that Gawli would be the right person to provide details of the fraud committed. Meanwhile, Khan filed an application before the court asking for relief after terming the ED investigation illegal and motivated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-mps-aide-blames-her-for-converting-trust-into-company/articleshow/86697369.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||4 caught after global phone exchange racket busted||New Delhi: Four people have been arrested for allegedly running an illegal telephone exchange in central Delhi. The accused were illegally terminating international calls on their servers while bypassing the national and international gateways, thereby causing a huge loss to the government. The arrested men have been identified as Mohammed Irfan, Zulfikar Ali, Irfan Ali and Adreeb Ali. Earlier, the cops had arrested an accused named Imran Khan in this case in February. The accused men were operating from Chawri Bazar. “Calls from USA, UAE, Canada, Nepal, Australia, Pakistan and many more foreign countries were being terminated illegally to Indian telephone or mobile numbers,” DCP (central) Shweta Chauhan said. Police began investigating this racket on a complaint filed by the telecom department. “Illegal international GSM termination exchanges were set up using SIP trunk, Internet and server-based technologies. The caller line identification would display Indian numbers for the internationally-landed calls,” the DCP said. “As a result, a huge number of calls went unregulated, causing massive revenue loss and compromising national security of India.” A police officer said that the two phone numbers were landing around 2.9 lakh calls per day, with call duration of 27,400 hours of calls per day. The loss from this crime is estimated to be around Rs 103 crore. International calls can only be terminated in India through DoT licensed operators, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-caught-after-global-phone-exchange-racket-busted/articleshow/86692513.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Heavy rain wreaks havoc in Namakkal, Erode districts||COIMBATORE: Heavy rain lashed Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode and Namakkal districts in western Tamil Nadu on Friday. Agricultural fields were inundated, streets were flooded and a few houses were damaged in Erode and Namakkal districts. What started as a drizzle, accompanied by incessant lightening around 3am on the day, soon grew into a heavy rain in Tiruchengode, Pallipalayam and surrounding areas in Namakkal district. The downpour continued for the next four hours without a break, inundating low-lying areas and agricultural fields. Rainwater gushed into houses at Suriyampalayam in Tiruchengode and Kootapalli Colony. Government authorities had to disconnect power supply to the affected localities to prevent untoward incidents. Fire and rescue services personnel and local body staff were deployed and they along with the residents pumped out the water from the houses. Officials said the rainwater had entered the houses at Pallipalayam as well. Traffic also came to a halt on many roads at Pallipalayam because of waterlogging. Pallipalayam bus stand was closed and uses from Erode to Salem via Pallipalayam were diverted through other routes. At least four tiled roof houses were damaged in rain-related calamities on Muniappan Kovil Street at Suriyampalayam in the district. However, no one was injured. While there was respite from the rain during the day, rainwater did not recede from residential areas. Namakkal collector Shreya P Singh said the revenue and municipal administration staff were taking efforts to drain the rainwater from roads and residential localities. “We have evacuated residents from 10 houses and moved them to a relief camp in a school. We have arranged food for them.” The collector also inspected the flood-hit areas. She found that storm water drains were blocked at several places and there were encroachments at two places on water channels that hindered the flow of rainwater, resulting in flooding. She has ordered the officials to remove the encroachments immediately. At Gobichettipalayam in Erode district, paddy that was stocked for procurement by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation was drenched, sparking fear among the farmers that they would go waste. Farmers said the paddy harvest was underway on 24,000 acres at Gobichettipalayam. The state government had opened more than 20 procurement centres in the locality, where the harvested paddy was kept in the open. Paddy kept at 10 such centres, including the ones at Nanjagoundanpalayam and Polavakkalipalayam, was drenched in the rain, the farmers said. They have to now take the paddy back, dry and bring them back at an additional expenditure. Tirupur district too received incessant rainfall and several stretches were inundated. While Coimbatore was spared from the heavy rain in the earlier part of the day, it gathered force in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-rain-wreaks-havoc-in-namakkal-erode-districts/articleshow/86692492.cms||---

The child was found in a semi-conscious state in a sugarcane farm in Halyala village in Athani taluk on September 23. Initial investigation into the case pointed to the child being being subjected to black magic going by the pattern of the burn injuries inflicted by the use of camphor and oil. A senior police officer said the girl initially showed signs of recovery but her condition took a turn for the worse as the injuries were grievous. The body has been sent for autopsy. Police also suspect that the parents had a role in the crime as they never filed a missing complaint. The burn injuries on her body were on the front and back. sides Police sent her pictures to their counterparts in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states to check if a missing complaint was filed in the neighbouring states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/toddler-suspected-to-be-victim-of-black-magic-dies/articleshow/86690213.cms||---

The baby was rescued on Thursday, police sources said. They identified the kidnappers as R Ramar, 45, of Angalakurichi and M Murugesan, 29, of Sethumadai, who were working as wall painters. While Ramar had no previous criminal record, Murugesan was involved in a theft case. M Muthupandi, 51, of Angalakurichi, had bought the girl from the duo, Coimbatore range deputy inspector general (DIG) of police M S Muthusamy said on Friday. “Muthupandi was working as a coir pith unit manager and has been childless for the last 20 years. He wanted to abduct a child and recently approached Ramar, seeking his help,” the officer said. Ramar and Murugesan kidnapped the child of Sangeetha and Manikandan of Mysore. “The couple had reached Anamalai to buy used clothes and was staying in a makeshift tent with their children. On Tuesday night, when Manikandan was away, Ramar and Murugesan approached Sangeetha and offered her money to buy her baby. They left the place when she refused, but approached her again to offer Rs 50 to buy chilli chicken for her children. When Sangeetha left for a shop leaving the baby with her daughter, the duo snatched the baby and escaped from the place. We rescued her from Muthupandi’s house,” Muthusamy said. Superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam had formed eight teams led by Valparai DSP Seenivasan to crack the case. The teams collected CCTV footage to nab the culprits.

She is seeking the transfer of a defamation complaint filed by veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar against her, as she says she has “lost faith’’ in the court. The actor had appeared before the Andheri magistrate at the last hearing to make her transfer application. Her lawyer Rizwan Siddiquee said she had lost faith since the magistrate had “repeatedly” said he would issue a warrant against her for non-appearance. The CMM took on record a reply filed by Akhtar who said Ranaut’s transfer plea is not only belated, but also an attempt to further delay the proceedings. Akhtar’s reply, through his advocate Jay Bharadwaj, sought dismissal of her application for “being devoid of all merits.’’ The court will hear Ranaut’s plea on October 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-to-hear-kanganas-transfer-plea-on-oct-18/articleshow/86692544.cms||---
---||Nashik||October 15 deadline for Mumbai-Agra national highway repair work in Kasara ghat||NASHIK: The Union ministry of road transport and highways has set a deadline of October 15 to complete the patch work and repair the potholes along the 12km stretch beginning from Kasara ghat of the Mumbai-Agra national highway passing through Igatpuri taluka in this north Maharashtra district. The stretch includes the Kasara ghat section that is in a pitiable condition, particularly because of the potholes, The Bombay high court also recently expressed concerns over the condition of the Mumbai-Nashik national highway. The National Highways Authorities of India’s (NHAI) project director (Nashik), B S Salunke, told TOI that the contractor had been directed to complete the repair work by the deadline issued by the ministry and ensure that the road was in a motorable condition. “The contractor is carrying out the work at a brisk pace. We are confident that the repair work will be completed by the deadline. Once the monsoon completely recedes, the 30km stretch of the highway that is under Nashik NHAI will be completely re-laid,” he added. Shiv Sena leader and Nashik MP Hemant Godse, however, appeared apprehensive about the quality of the repair work. “The damaged stretch is quite long and I am apprehensive whether the contractor would be able to undertake quality repairs by the deadline. NHAI authorities ought to keep a close tab on the work and its quality,” he said. Godse said he was planning to meet Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, who is scheduled to be in Nashik for a two-day visit and discuss the Mumbai-Nashik highway issue. Industrialist and Nashik First Foundation chairman Abhay Kulkarni said, “The contractor has used paver blocks in some stretches for road repairs. This can be dangerous for small vehicles, which can skid on the road. This highway is the lifeline of Nashik. It connects the district to Mumbai. Unfortunately, the powers-that-be are neglecting Nashik or else the condition of the road would not have been in such a miserable condition.” An official of the road construction firm said the paver blocks were put to cover the potholes when it was raining. “We are now removing the paver blocks to repair the potholes with tar,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/centre-sets-oct-15-deadline-for-patchwork-on-mumbai-agra-highways-kasara-ghat-section/articleshow/86688209.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: IPS officer’s domestic help gets 7 years in jail||AHMEDABAD: A week after he was acquitted of charges of trespassing in IPS officer Shamsher Singh’s house at Samarpan Flats, a housing society for bureaucrats and judges, the domestic help Sonu Patel (23) was on Friday punished by a metropolitan court with seven years in jail for another case of theft and lurking house-trespass in the same colony in February 2017. Patel, a native of Chhattisgarh, was arrested by Gujarat University police after Singh’s family member lodged a complaint of trespassing, where he was employed as a house worker. Before he was arrested, he was also accused of assault on the minor daughter of another senior IPS officer a year before that. Patel was tried for offences under Sections 454, 457 and 380 of the IPC – for lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night to commit an offence, and for theft in the house. Four years after the incident, additional sessions judge S P Dulera held Patel guilty of the offence. He was handed down seven years in jail for lurking house-trespass and five-year imprisonment for the theft. The court also imposed fine of Rs 20,000 each for all three offences he has been convicted for. On default of payment of fine, the court has ordered six more months in jail for the convict. The court has ordered that all the jail terms would run concurrently. While sending the jail warrant for Patel, the court has ordered the jail authorities to return his valuables and cash that the police had seized from him, a wristwatch and cash of Rs 13,800 after he serves his sentence. A week before, Patel got the benefit of doubt from the same court when he was tried for entering into the dining room of IPS officer Singh’s house, where he was employed as domestic help. The court acquitted him by granting benefit of doubt because the evidence presented by witnesses, and scientific evidence from forensics had appeared contradictory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ips-officers-domestic-help-gets-7-yrs-in-jail/articleshow/86690219.cms||---

The number of active cases in taluka dropped from 290 on September 23 to 198 on September 30. During the same period, the active cases in the district registered a drop from 1,035 to 940, the district health authorities noted. Though the number of cases has dropped, the tests have gone up by 500. An average of 4,941 Covid tests were conducted in the same week. The rate of weekly positivity was 1.23% on September 30 as against 2.18% a week earlier. On September 28, the number of active cases (885) was the lowest since the second wave of Covid began in February this year. Dr Anant Pawar, the nodal officer of Covid, civil hospital said that it was a positive indication that the infection has not risen, considering that 14 days have passed since the Ganeshotsav ended. “However, it may be noted that this is a crucial time to keep a close watch on the rise in fresh cases, especially when the schools are also reopening from Monday,” Dr Pawar said. The health authorities said that all the officials concerned have been informed to monitor the health of the children during the forthcoming period. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said, “The lockdown was part of measures to contain spread of disease. Now restrictions are easing. Schools, temples, cinema halls are opening up. If people are able to contain spread of infection now, the things could be very good in future,” collector said. Like Sinnar, the cases were on decline in Niphad taluka though they have marginally increased in other parts during the same 7-day period. The active cases in Nashik city were 279, the same as the week back.

---||Aurangabad||Only husband can be prosecuted in instant triple talaq case: Bombay HC||PUNE: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has quashed and set aside the prosecution of two in-laws of a woman from Beed under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 (for instant triple talaq) observing that the same was “unsustainable” and holding that only the husband was liable to be prosecuted and not his relatives. Based on the woman’s complaint on September 6, 2019, the Beed police had registered offences of harassment, assault, criminal intimidation and other IPC sections, besides under the Muslim Women (Protection of Right on Marriage) Act against her husband, mother-in-law and sister-in-law. The two in-laws had moved the high court seeking quashing of the FIR. The HC bench of justices Sunil Deshmukh and Nitin Suryavanshi, however, said that there were specific allegations against the woman’s mother-in-law relating to harassment, assault and other IPC offences and the FIR, to that extent, cannot be quashed against the mother-in-law. The high court quashed the FIR against the sister-in-law observing that she was staying with her husband at a different place in the same city and only vague and general allegations were made against her. During the hearing, additional public prosecutor M M Nerlikar, appearing for the state, had conceded that the two in-laws could not have been prosecuted under the 2019 Act for the protection of rights of Muslim women. Lawyer Sudarshan Salunke, representing the two in-laws, had submitted that continuation of criminal proceedings against the two applicants will be nothing but abuse of process of law. “Registration of crime under the 2019 Act against them for merely being relatives, was not permissible,” he submitted. The bench upheld these arguments and went on to quash and set aside the two in-laws prosecution under the 2019 Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/only-husband-can-be-prosecuted-in-instant-triple-talaq-case-hc/articleshow/86688230.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The panel said it would carry out periodical reviews of the compliance of dust mitigation measures at construction and demolition (C&D) sites across NCR, asking states to ensure the web portal was functional as soon as possible. While Delhi government informed CAQM that its web portal was in the testing phase, UP informed the commission that it had been completed and the portal was ready to be used. Rajasthan and Haryana were yet to develop their portals, a source said. The commission said the portal would allow prompt action to be taken against offenders not following dust norms and adding to the pollution, especially in winters. “The introduction of a robust online mechanism for monitoring dust mitigation measures is a compelling necessity to ensure strict implementation of the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules. All C&D related projects — on plot area equal to or greater than 500 square meters — in the NCR have to mandatorily register at the web portal. Along with this, provision for video fencing equipped with remote connectivity technology will be incorporated in the web portal for effective and round-the-clock monitoring of compliance of dust mitigation measures by the project proponents,” said CAQM in a statement on Friday. The project proponents also needed to install reliable and low-cost PM2.5 and PM10 sensors at project sites, it added. The panel said project proponents were also expected to upload self-declaration on fortnightly-basis and certify compliance of stipulated dust norms through the portal. “An exhaustive checklist will form the basis for monitoring compliance of dust mitigation measures in the NCR through this online mechanism,” said CAQM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-panel-seeks-report-on-dust-check-portal/articleshow/86692602.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Kaleswaram row: HC notice to Telangana, Centre||HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Friday gave the state and central governments four weeks to respond to a PIL alleging that the Kaleswaram irrigation project was being expanded by Telangana without the required environmental clearance. A bench of justices Shameem Akther and K Lakshman was hearing a PIL filed by Cheruku Srinivas Reddy of Siddipet accusing the state of going ahead with expansion work despite clear direction from the Union jal shakti ministry not to proceed. Pointing out that state had environmental clearance to draw only 2 tmc of Godavari water per day at Medigadda for 90 days during rains, petitioner’s counsel Ch Ravi Kumar said: “But the state later unilaterally decided to increase it to 3 tmc per day and began construction in tune with the unapproved expanded version of the project. The required clearances from the jal shakti ministry and the environment wing were never obtained.” The jal shakti ministry has recently asked the state to stop construction of the unapproved part of the project, the counsel said. However, advocate general (AG) BS Prasad said that Kaleswaram construction was in accordance with approvals already obtained. “This is a pre-approved project,” he said, adding that ongoing projects could seek approvals within six months in case of capacity enhancement. Moreover, he added, that the state was in talks with the Centre at the highest levels. “We will file a counter explaining all these things after duly obtaining instructions and ascertaining status,” the AG said. Countering the state’s claims, Kumar alleged that the state had undermined the Centre’s authority by continuing expansion despite orders to stop. “The Union minister has asked the state to obtain revised approvals for revised project plans. The state has neither challenged them nor accorded any respect to them,” he said.

Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sachin Sawant launched a frontal attack against the BJP, saying it had provided “safe passage” to Singh, while BJP legislator Ram Kadam expressed shock and surprise over the “disappearance” of former home minister Anil Deshmukh, who is wanted by the Enforcement Directorate as well as the CBI. “The Param Bir Singh case is identical with that of the disappearance of Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya. If Singh has left India, it appears that BJP has played a crucial role in his exit from India. It was on the agenda of the BJP,” Sawant alleged. Sawant said it was the National Investigating Agency which was probing into the Antilia bomb scare case. “The NIA chargesheet clearly says that (now-dismissed API) Sachin Waze was reporting directly to Singh, who paid Rs five lakh to a cyber expert to shift the blame on to Jaish Ul Hind. Under circumstances, we feel that if Singh has fled the country, it is the failure of the NIA and the Central government. I am sure that in the days to come, the truth will be out and people will know how Singh fled,” Sawant said. BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam said it was necessary to detect the location of Param Bir Singh, but at the same time, the state government must launch a massive search in order to trace Anil Deshmukh, who too is “absconding.” “Both state Congress president Nana Patole and Sawant must explain to the people about the whereabouts of Deshmukh,” Kadam said. The Chandiwal commission probing into Singh’s letter to the CM had issued a bailable warrant against Singh, but the CID, entrusted with the task of serving the order, failed to trace him at his known places of residence. In fact, on July 12, the CID had issued a lookout notice against Singh. Thane police too had issued a lookout notice, but law-enforcing agencies have not been able to trace him. During the course of the commission’s hearing, Deshmukh’s lawyer had urged it to attach all of Singh’s immovable and movable assets as he was not responding to summons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-bjp-trade-barbs-over-param-bir-deshmukhs-disappearance/articleshow/86692594.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Manacaud special village officer suspended for fraud||Thiruvananthapuram: The revenue vigilance department has unearthed a major fraud at the Manacaud village office, where a parallel village office was functioning outside using the records that should be safely maintained at the village office. A search conducted by the revenue vigilance team at Manacaud village office found that the ‘thandaper’ register, which should be confidentially maintained at the village office, was missing, and was later found that the official concerned had handed over it to an outsider for several days. The matter came to light when the office of the deputy collector (vigilance) received a phone call in the morning on September 23 informing them that the thandaper registers were missing from the Manacaud village office. When the team of revenue vigilance officials conducted a search at the village office by noon, it was found that the thandaper register containing details of 1,000 citizens (from thandaper number 33,000 to 34,000) were missing from the office. Since the village officer at Manacaud office had only taken charge recently, and after finding that the responsibility of maintaining the thandaper register was with special village officer Sanal Kumar, the vigilance officials asked him to submit the register immediately. As soon as Sanal Kumar made a phone call, an individual Sasankan, who is an outsider and is reportedly a document writer, turned up at the office with the register and handed it over to the special village officer. When asked, the special village officer claimed that the register was handed over for binding, and the person who brought back the register was not known to him. On the basis of the report from the revenue vigilance officials, land revenue commissioner K Biju suspended special village officer Sanal Kumar, who was prima facie found responsible for the fraud, under the rule 10 (1) of the Kerala civil services (classification, control and appeal) rules, 1960. “We think that a parallel village office has been functioning using the details of the land holders in the thandaper register. “Those with vested interests were colluding with some of the officials to possibly use the details in the register for activities like real estate transactions etc. A detailed inquiry has begun in this matter,” Biju told TOI. According to revenue department sources, it is highly possible that every volume of the thandaper register is being taken out in this manner. The thandaper register, which contains the list of thandaper (record of possession created to collect basic tax from a property) holders in that particular village, can be manipulated for various frauds. In the infamous Kadakampally land fraud in the capital, it was found that the perpetrators had created fake thandapers and used those thandapers in other people’s name for land transactions at various sub-registrar offices in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/manacaud-special-village-officer-suspended-for-fraud/articleshow/86661206.cms||KP Saikiran

The minister was visiting the tower to inspect its progress and said it was capable of reducing PM 2.5 levels from 151 micrograms per cubic metre to around 38 micrograms, while the PM 10 concentration of 165 micrograms per cubic metre was brought down to around 41 micrograms on Friday morning. “The smog tower was inaugurated on August 23 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on behalf of the Delhi government. After that, it was being tested on a pilot basis and with the trial now complete, it has started functioning at full capacity,” said Rai on Friday. The minister stated the Delhi government had also constituted a 16-member committee that would be inspecting the data generated by the tower. The monitoring committee will be submitting a total of three reports to the government, at intervals of three months each, based on which the government will decide if more smog towers should be installed across Delhi. The 16-member committee includes a five-member team from Delhi Pollution Control Committee, a five-member team from IIT Bombay, three members of NBCC and three members of Tata Projects Limited. The tower can clean air in a radius of 1 kilometre and can purify around 1,000 cubic metres of air per second before releasing it back, officials said. Rai added that a display screen had been installed outside the tower, which would display real-time readings of air pollution data and the impact the tower was having in the vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/80-reduction-in-pollution-through-cp-tower-says-rai/articleshow/86692650.cms||---

The teacher had named his second wife as a pension nominee after he retired from service in August 2017. His first wife has filed a civil suit in a district court which is pending on the issue of legally wedded wife. “We have not been pointed out any provision under the Pension Rules that the pension cannot be paid to the employee unless the issue of his nominee is settled,” the HC bench said and directed the AG office to ensure that “the final pension amount payable to the petitioner, from the date of his superannuation, onwards, is settled within 4 weeks from today (Sept 22, date of judgment) and all arrears of pension amount shall be paid to him on or before November 30. The amount towards commutation of pension of Rs4.27 lakh shall be paid to the petitioner on or before October 25, if not already paid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/high-court-relief-to-teacher-over-pension-matter/articleshow/86688250.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Sohail Kathoriya continued driving despite constable Vijaysinh Gurav (48) sitting on the SUV’s bonnet when he did not stop his vehicle despite being signalled for violating traffic rules under Azad Nagar Metro station in Andheri (W) on Thursday morning. Kathoriya later abandoned his SUV and fled. He was tracked down at his home after D N Nagar police got his details from the regional transport office (RTO), where his vehicle was registered. “Kathoriya was produced before an Andheri court and remanded to police custody till Saturday. He violated traffic rules, and when the constable tried to stop him, he tried to speed his vehicle,” said D N Nagar police senior inspector Milind Kurde. Kathoriya was booked under IPC sections 279 (rash driving) and 353 (obstructing a public servant from discharging duty). A video of the incident went viral. Gurav’s complaint said he gestured to the motorist to halt, but he flashed an ID card claiming he was a mediaperson. “When he tried to flee, I climbed onto the bonnet, assuming he would step out and I would challan him. But he drove away with me seated on the bonnet,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bizman-held-for-speeding-with-cop-on-suv-bonnet/articleshow/86692673.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

While temples will open from October 7, entry will be restricted so as to ensure that there is no overcrowding on the premises. “As per government orders, the temples will open but large congregation of people, in the form of fairs, will not be allowed. Instead, people will be allowed to visit the temple only by taking the passes for the visit,” said BA Kapse, tehsildar of Kalwan taluka. Shri Saptashrung Niwasini Devi Trust will be making the passes available online for pilgrims in a couple of days. The pilgrims can start using the passes to book their slot. Maximum of 1,000 pilgrim passes will be allotted per hour. The temple will remain open over 24 hours until Dassera, when the Navaratra fair organised annually at the temple concludes. The entry to the pilgrims will be restricted at Nandur village, which is at the foothills of the Saptashrung hill. The administration has already announced that no private vehicle will be allowed to pass the post till the end of the festival. Along with Saptashrung hill, there are four other locations where pilgrims from across the state and country visit during this period. These include Renuka Maata Mandir (Bhagur and Chandwad), Jagdamba Mata (Yeola) and Kalika Mata (Nashik city). The yatra remains cancelled this year too at all these places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/passes-mandatory-for-pilgrims-to-visit-saptashrungi-shrine-during-navaratra/articleshow/86688310.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||In Bapu’s footsteps||AHMEDABAD: As India is celebrating 75th year of Independence, it’s also the occasion of 152 years of Mahatma Gandhi. As part of a national project, the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust (SAPMT) had initiated documentation of 39 important sites associated with Mahatma Gandhi. The mammoth work, which would eventually take shape of Gandhi Heritage Site Memorial (GHSM) website by the ministry of culture, was completed during the period of pandemic by the team. “There are several anecdotes associated with the sites that might be new to many. For example, Kausani in Uttarakhand is the only place where Bapu took a ‘holiday’ in 1929. However, the time spent at a dak bungalow was primarily to revise Srimad Bhagwad Gita,” said an official associated with the project. The team went through the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi painstakingly to find references to these core sites. The final project would also have architectural design and virtual tour of several of these spots – something which is existing in a different form on Gandhi Heritage Portal. About the sites in Gujarat, the researchers have several nuggets of information. For example, Mahatma had authorized Maneklal Gandhi, his cousin’s son, to sell the ancestral house in Porbandar to renowned industrialist Nanji Kalidas Mehta. The building later became a national memorial. While Mahatma’s first imprisonment in India was in Sabarmati Central Jail, he only spent 10 days there once in 1922 and one day in 1933. On both occasions, he was later shifted to Yeravda jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-bapus-footsteps/articleshow/86690302.cms||Parth Shastri

On Thursday evening two neighbours of a society in the Sola got into a fight after one fell due to a pit while passing by the other on two wheelers. The incident took place when Rakesh Shah, 50, resident of Dream Residency near Hetarth Party plot on Science City Road, was riding his scooter near Swapnil Society in the same area. At that time, his neighbour Divyesh Patel was also going somewhere on his scooter and he came in front of Shah. When they were about to cross each other, a pit came in the way of Shah due to which he lost balance and leaned towards Patel. Though Shah managed to escape an accident, Patel suspected Shah was intentionally trying to hit him. Later, Patel caught Shah at a paan shop and began beating him there. Patel had earlier called up his brother-in-law too, who rushed there with a stick and the duo then beat up Shah, injuring him. As Shah’s wife got to know about the fight, she along with his brother arrived at the spot, rescued Shah and took him to a private hospital.

The BJP councillors, who continued their protest inside the council hall on Wednesday night, are continuing the sit in protest for the second day. The BJP has made it clear that they will not withdraw the protest until a comprehensive probe is ordered into the corruption in the revenue collection and all those involved are punished. The BJP has been alleging that several LDF councillors have a role in this corruption, but the action is being taken only against the officials. However, Mayor Arya Rajendran made it clear that an investigation is going on and hence there is no need to accept the demands of the opposition. Meanwhile, the UDF members also started a dharna inside the corporation hall demanding action against all the officials involved in the corruption and for maintaining peace inside the corporation. The council meeting had witnessed several unruly scenes on Wednesday as both the BJP and LDF members got involved in heated exchanges. The councillors, including women members from the BJP, are continuing inside the council hall for the second consecutive day. Union minister of state V Muraleedharan also visited the BJP councillors inside the hall. Even though former minister Kadakampally Surendran had held discussions with the BJP councillors to end the stalemate, they were not ready to withdraw from the protest. Meanwhile, the BJP councillors on Thursday approached the state police chief and filed a complaint seeking a probe into the corruption in the revenue collection at the different zonal offices. The LDF members alleged that the BJP councillors are purposefully disrupting the functioning of the council . The Museum police have registered a case against BJP councillor V G Girikumar for allegedly manhandling Deputy Mayor P K Raju during the council meeting on Wednesday. He was booked for simple hurt, which is a bailable offence, and further legal procedures will be completed soon, said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-protest-on-for-second-day/articleshow/86661300.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: This Daan Utsav, pen wishes for armed forces on cards||This rangoli is made of 36 dots but they are invisible,” reads the Hindi text on a yellow page that bears a rangoli drawn with a pen. “Similarly, India’s soldiers are not visible but they protect us, and, like this rangoli, fill our lives with colour.” Made by 12-year-old Hinkle Idnani from Ulhasnagar, this handcrafted analogy is among nearly one lakh greeting cards meant for the Indian armed fo-rces that have reached collecti-on centres of Making A Differ-ence (MAD) Foundation so far. As part of #DaanUtsav this year, MAD Foundation is running a campaign called ‘Vande Mataram Diwali 2021: Desh Videsh Se Sainiko Ko Sandesh’. “The idea of the initiative is to encourage individuals, schools, NGOs and organisations in every state of India to convey their emotions and wishes for the armed forces in the light of both India’s 75th year of Independence and Diwali, which falls on November 4,” said Haresh Shah, founder of the NGO. “We are looking to tap Indians living abroad too,” said Shah, a math professor, adding that he aims to receive exactly 7.5 lakh greeting cards by the end of #DaanUtsav October 15. Why 7.5 lakh? That figure would mark India’s 75th year of Independence, he said. The rules of participation are simple. Before October 15, prepare a handmade Diwali greeting card with your Diwali wishes and personal gratitude and send it to MAD Foundation, which has 25 collection centres in Mumbai. Participants can even upload images of their handcrafted greeting card online. “In return, each greeting card sender will get an e-certificate acknowledging their efforts,” said Shah. Besides Indians in the US, Canada, Australia, Kenya and the UK, 270 institutes in the country, including NGOs, schools and colleges such as IIM-Ahmedabad and IIM-Bangalore, have collaborated with the initiative so far. From an LED-powered shoebox that lights up the words ‘Happy Diwali’ when you join its wires to a card boasting pleated crepe paper in the colours of the Indian flag, their handcrafted contributions have impressed Shah with their creative range. “We are excited about the fact that we are able to ignite this creative thought process in children,” said Shah, citing students in a school in UP’s Lalitpur who pooled in their pocket money to purchase raw material for the cards. A greeting card sent by a visually challenged girl was among this lot. It stirred the motivational speaker in Shah: “Nothing can obstruct you from expressing your emotions for the armed forces.” To participate, send in your greeting cards to Making A Difference Foundation, 9A 1st Floor Vimal Udyog Bhavan, Taikalwadi Road, Matunga West, Mumbai – 400016.

According to the police, the crime took place when the parents of the girl and the man went to the Chandkheda area to attend an obituary meet of a relative. As the accused knew that the girl was at her home with her younger brother, he called up his aunt and told her that he had met with an accident near her house and wanted to take some rest due to pain. Her aunt told him to go to her home, take rest and stay with his cousin brother and sister. “He went to the home and told her that he was hungry. She made some food for him and after taking food, he acted as if he was sleeping,” said an officer of Ranip police. The officer said that when he found that the girl was alone in her room, he barged into her room and tried to rape her. As he began molesting her, she screamed for help and a domestic help who was working at her home, rushed there and rescued the girl from him. He ran towards another room and closed himself inside to save himself from some neighbours who also rushed there hearing the hue and cry. Somehow, he found an opportunity and fled from there. After an hour, when others went from her home, he again came there and abused the victim threatening her with dire consequences. Scared with this incident, the girl along with her younger brother went to her friend’s house near Ranip vegetable market. When her parents returned from the obituary meet, they found their house locked. They called up their daughter who narrated the incident to them. After which, they took her to Ranip police and filed a complaint of molestation and POCSO (protection of children against sexual offences) act. The accused was held from his house on Thursday night.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: 6 of Navy climbing team missing after avalanche||UTTARKASHI: Less than 500m from the summit of Mt Trishul, one of Uttarakhand’s highest and most difficult peaks, a Navy mountaineering team was hit by a massive avalanche early morning on Friday. Five Navy mountaineers and a guide were reported missing. While a search operation was set in motion immediately, it had to be called off by late afternoon because of bad weather. It will resume on Saturday. A teenaged mountaineering prodigy the PM had spoken about on ‘Mann Ki Baat’, Kamya Karthikeyan, and her naval officer father are part of the mountaineering team, locals said, but it could not be confirmed if they were among those attempting the final summit. Kamya, 13, became the youngest mountaineer to scale the 6,962-m Mount Aconcagua in the Andes last year. “#IndianNavy mountaineering expedition to Mt Trishul, Uttarakhand caught in an avalanche near the summit today. All out efforts for Search and Rescue (SAR) being progressed by the ground team and helicopters from #IndianArmy, #IndianAirForce & State Disaster Response Force,” the Indian Navy spokesperson tweeted from its verified account on Friday afternoon. “The 20 member expedition was flagged off from Mumbai on 03 Sep 21. Ten climbers had started their climb to the summit this morning, but were caught in an avalanche short of the summit. While 5 of the 10 are safe SAR for remaining 5 is in progress.” The Trishul gets its name from the trident-like appearance of its three peaks. The team was climbing Trishul-I, which is 7,120m high. The expedition was being conducted as part of Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations, which mark 50 years of the Bangladesh Liberation War. “The expedition is being led by Cdr Vishnu Prasad and has 19 other members drawn from various units of the Indian Navy,” a defence statement had said at the time, adding that it would begin the trek from Sutol in Chamoli, the closest point with a road, to the base camp on September 14. Sources told TOI that the team began its climb on September 23. “An advance Navy team, with jawans and support staff, moved towards Trishul on September 19. A second team moved on September 23, which Kamya and her father were part of,” said Kamal Singh, a local of Sutol village. “On Friday early morning, a lead team of 10 Navy personnel and a few guides started the final ascent. Another team stayed at the summit camp, waiting for its turn. Around 5.30am, when the lead team was about 400-500m from the peak, it was caught in a massive avalanche,” a source said. As an alert went out, the Air Force and the Army sent helicopters and jawans to the avalanche-hit area to start a search and rescue operation. A team of experts from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) was also called in. “Six mountaineers, including five Navy personnel, have been missing since the avalanche. The rest are safe in camp,” Colonel Amit Bisht, NIM principal who is leading the team, confirmed. “Time is crucial in such rescue operations. It determines the chances of survival. We lose valuable time picking up and dropping off rescue forces and equipment. Had there been a helipad at NIM and with other rescue agencies, we could have acted faster."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/6-of-navy-climbing-team-missing-after-avalanche/articleshow/86688367.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

With Covid-19 cases plateauing in the state, last week the Maharashtra government had announced reopening of all places of worship from October 7, the first day of Navratri. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said all places of worship will open for devotees, but they will have to follow strict safety protocols. In the first wave, the state had reopened temples in November after Diwali, and within five months, they were shut when the second wave hit in April. “Based on the state government’s orders, all places of worship and religious places in the BMC area can allow only 50% devotees and all Covid-19 protocols must be followed,” said an order issued by BMC chief Iqbal Chahal on Friday. According to the state government’s standard operating procedure, maintaining social distance and masking will be a must, and no prasad or holy water is to be served inside. The state has said staggering of visitors and slots should be fixed based on the size of the premises. Frequently sanitising the premises and no touching of idols and holy books is also mentioned. Religious events and congregations have still not been allowed. Common prayer mats should be avoided, people should get their own mats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-places-of-worship-can-fill-up-to-only-50-capacity/articleshow/86692812.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||No bail for man who used fake Aadhaar to marry||New Delhi: A Delhi court denied bail to a man who allegedly married a woman by posing as a Hindu and forcibly tried to convert her to Islam. The woman had accused the man of convincing her of his religion with a fake Aadhaar card but later threatening to kill her when she resisted conversion. “The forgery of an Aadhaar card entails serious consequences for national security as it is a vital document,” metropolitan magistrate Jitendra Pratap Singh said in the order denying bail. The court sought the intervention of Delhi’s police commissioner and noted that the case required investigation by specialised agencies. The judge said that the complainant alleged the accused had shown her an Aadhaar card displaying his photograph and the name Rahul Sharma when proposing marriage to her. “The local police is unable to get information regarding the said Aadhaar card from UIDAI and, therefore, the investigation is to be carried out by some special unit/branch as preparation of a forged Aadhaar card involves serious ramifications and the likelihood of a widespread and well-equipped gang of persons in such activity cannot be ruled out,” the order said. The woman had claimed that the accused had married her in a temple by saying he was a Hindu named Rahul Sharma. It was only on the birthday of their daughter that she learnt he was allegedly a Muslim and that he then insisted on a marriage in the Islamic tradition. Under pressure, the woman claimed, she underwent the second ceremony. The court noted, “Initially fearing social ridicule the informant did not come forward to take any legal action. Taking advantage of this the applicant (accused) proposed the informant (woman) to accept Islam and marry again as per the Islamic tradition in order to secure her future as a result of which on 20.06.2012 under tremendous pressure and fear and considering the future of her child, the informant married the accused as per Islamic rites.” The woman also accused the man of abusing her, her child and their religion and threatening her with death whenever she protested. Police had filed an FIR under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery), 471 (using forged documents as genuine) and 495 (bigamy). The accused insisted he was falsely implicated in the case on the basis of fabricated allegations and the complainant had converted matrimonial disputes into penal offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-man-who-used-fake-aadhaar-to-marry/articleshow/86692809.cms||Usha Das

The railway division has proposed to start operations on 108km stretch between Bichia and Mailani with two Vistalook coaches of meter gauge, which will give a panoramic view to passengers through the glass window while sitting on cushioned chairs. Earlier in September, the railways had conducted its successful trial. According to railway officials, the fare for the service would be kept in affordable range. Passengers will have a memorable experience of riding through Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary and Dudhwa National Park, the two tiger reserve zones in Terai belt of Uttar Pradesh. “The Vistalook coaches will be a part of an express train, as running just two-coach train will not be financially feasible. We expect that the service will start in the next two weeks,” DRM Monica Agnihotri said.

By Friday, all schools and junior colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region got permission from their civic bodies and district administrations to start offline classes. Like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Vasai-Virar civic bodies have consent for reopening classes 8-12. Schools in rural Thane and Palghar districts can run classes 5-12. When Covid-free villages were allowed to re-start physical classes from July 15, only 35% schools opened and 10% students attended. Now, the state wants all civic and zilla parishad schools to open from Monday. Teachers have been urged to make all efforts to convince parents to send their children to schools. Aided and private schools are being told to make more efforts to bring children back to classes. Though schools have begun implementing the standard operating procedures laid down by the government, many want one to two weeks to start physical classes. “Currently our online exams are underway. We plan to reopen by October 18 but it will be just to acclimatize students to school. Our learning will continue online,” said a principal. An official said the response will help decide on bringing back smaller children to classrooms. “If students are found to settle down in schools after 18 months, we will want to reopen all classes,” he said. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad assured schools that if any student tests positive, all medical help will be provided by the state. State paediatric task force member Dr Samir Dalwai advised teachers to allow students to mingle with their friends in class and talk about their life away from schools. Around two weeks should be sufficient for children to settle down in their classrooms. School heads said parents seem keen on sending children to school. “Nearly 450 of the 1,500 students have given consent to attend school,” said Neelu Lamba, principal, Hiranandani school, Thane. Another school principal said over 50% of parents are fine with offline schooling.

This follows the high court upholding the constitutional validity of amended section 20(2) (a-v) of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act pertaining to utilisation of services/facilities. In Tadakal Woman Milk Producers Co-operative Society Vs State of Karnataka case, the court had already upheld the validity of amended section 20(2)( a-iv), which said a member or delegate has to attend a minimum of three meetings to sustain their voting rights. Justice PS Dinesh Kumar dismissed petitions filed by hundreds of members of various co-operative societies challenging the amended section 20(2)(a-v). He, however, said the operation of both provisions would be effective for elections after the date of disposal of the petitions, post-August 4, 2021. The amended act received the governor’s assent in 2013. Advocates for the petitioners said that the act was not enforced till 2018. Following writ petitions filed against section 20(2)(a-v), the court, vide interim orders, permitted the members to vote and participate in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-amended-rule-of-co-op-societies-act-upheld/articleshow/86704088.cms||---

The incident happened at Puliyarakonam under Vilappilsala police station limits in the district on Wednesday night. Lekshmi, a resident of Maruthamkuzhy, was attacked by her former live-in partner Biju. The police have launched a hunt for Biju, who went absconding after the incident. The police said that Biju and Lekshmi were living together for the past four years. Recently, they have been living separately owing to alleged domestic violence by Biju. On Wednesday, she reached his house around 8 pm along with her toddler son in an auto rickshaw. He took her alone into a room, locked the door from inside and poured the acid, which was stored in a canister, over her head. She suffered burn injuries all over her body, including head, face, chest, torso and thighs. She ran out of the house in pain and rushed to the nearby hospital in the same rickshaw that was waiting for her outside. Vilappilsala sub inspector Shibu said that Biju had clubbed her on head using an iron rod before pouring the acid. “The suspect is a rubber tapping labourer and this explains the presence of formic acid in his house,” the sub inspector said, adding that formic acid was used for the purpose of coagulation of rubber sheets. He said that Lekshmi arrived at Biju's residence on Wednesday night as per the latter's invitation. ''While residing at Seethathode in Pathanamthitta for a brief period, Biju had pawned some of her gold ornaments. After separation, she demanded them back. He told her to come to his house around Wednesday so that he could return the ornaments,” the SI said, adding that the attack could have been premeditated. Lekshmi was previously married to another man and has two children in that relationship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-injured-in-acid-attack/articleshow/86661492.cms||---

For instance, during the pandemic, all schools were closed, but it was much safer for boarding schools, than for day schools, to stay open. But there was no voice to speak for the boarding schools,” said Rashid Sharfuddin, secretary of BSAI and headmaster of SelaQui International School. “There is no association in the country exclusively for boarding schools. Our association will work with the government in terms of influencing their policies and decisions regarding education. Also, with this platform, the boarding schools across the country will make their existence felt,” he said. “The founding members include elite boarding schools in the country and we took the decision last year after speaking to the principals of various boarding schools,” said Sharfuddin, adding that the body would soon tie up with Boarding Schools’ Association of UK to create a network that can assist in the students’ welfare. The BSAI will protect and project the interests of all fully residential non-aided private schools in the country and aims to get 150 residential schools of the country registered with them by year-end, its members said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mayo-doon-welham-scindia-top-schools-form-boarding-union/articleshow/86688561.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid record doses, share of private vax jabs plateaus at 11L||MUMBAI: Paid vaccination in the city has remained stagnant in September even as public vaccination registered a jump of nearly 80%. The month saw record-breaking 18.4 lakh vaccinations in the public sector, a 78.5% jump over August when 10.3 lakh shots were administered. However, vaccinations didn’t grow in the private sector at all, where 11.1 lakh doses were administered in September compared to 11.06 lakh in August. If compared, paid vaccinations in September crept up merely by 0.5% over August. Several private vaccination centres told TOI that they are placing orders for fresh stocks judiciously as they are unsure if the volumes would be used. For the first time since the start of vaccination, BMC received stocks of 19.3 lakh doses in September. It was nearly twice the monthly volumes received over the past few months. As the public centres became flush with doses, the demand for paid vaccination plummeted further. “The demand for paid vaccination has drastically dropped and we don’t see it rising anytime soon,” said Dr Bhupendra Avasthi, director of Surya Hospital in Santacruz. Fearing that they will be left with unused doses, most are placing orders for smaller tranches, ranging from 3,000-10,000 doses. “A majority of the vaccination happening now is through CSR. Hospitals placing big orders are for CSR drives,” said Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Hospitals. Private vaccination was allowed in Mumbai as early as February, although the numbers picked up only from March. Between March and May, private centres vaccinated an average 3 lakh people every month. During this time, public centres were vaccinating an average of 7.5 lakh. Paid vaccination peaked in June with 13.5 lakh shots. Thereafter, the numbers plunged to 8 lakh in July before plateauing at 11 lakh in August and September. “A lot of private orders placed in May were fulfilled in June, which gave a boost to the figures,” said a hospital head from Borivli. “We don’t think we will see the June rush again till adolescent vaccination is allowed,” he said. Surana agreed. With 139 private vaccination centres operating in Mumbai, the pool of beneficiaries has got smaller for hospitals, said Dr Vrajesh Shah of Apex hospitals. Avasthi added that nearly 90% of Mumbaikars are vaccinated, so the small pool left remaining could be of those awaiting the second dose or hesitant to get vaccinated. The state’s private hospitals have administered 1.1 crore of the overall 8 crore doses administered. In Mumbai, 42.5% of the 1.2 crore shots have been in the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-record-doses-share-of-pvt-vax-jabs-plateaus-at-11l/articleshow/86692892.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Boat from Neendakara used for human trafficking||Kollam: The Q Branch CID of Tamil Nadu police have reportedly taken a Rameswaram native who bought a fishing boat from Neendakara into custody on alleged human trafficking charges. Joseph Raj, a Rameswaram native had purchased the boat from Shefeer Ahammed of Palottu house, Sakthikualngara, in June this year using a benami and altered the boat to accommodate around 50 people in its deck to be used for human trafficking. Shefeer sold his boat St Alex to Easwari, a Kulathupuzha native and relative of Joseph Raj, for Rs.40 lakh. But it was Joseph Raj who paid the money to Shefeer. Later, he brought the boat to Rameswaam and altered its body, changed its colour, and increased the diesel tank capacity by many fold. However, he complained to the Rameswaram police 10 days back that his boat was missing. As the police investigation intensified the Q Branch CID intervened and in their investigation more details were unravelled. The Q Branch alerted the Central Intelligence Bureau, Kerala Special Branch and Coastal police about the chances of human trafficking using the altered fishing vessel. According to reports, Easwari is in Q Branch custody for questioning. Shefeer had a close connection with Joseph Raj and he had given a share in the ownership of his boats to him. Meanwhile, Shefeer said he had complied with all legal formalities when he sold the boat.According to Shefeer, it is a practice in the fisheries sector at Neendakara to jointly own fishing boats. Several such boats have joint owners from Tamil Nadu as most often workers from Tamil Nadu and Kerala go for fishing in same boat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/boat-from-neendakara-used-for-human-trafficking/articleshow/86661569.cms||---
---||Delhi||Dengue stings Delhiites, hospital beds filling up||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 cases have gone down significantly in Delhi but hospitals in the city say their beds are running full once again due to a sudden increase in dengue cases. In the last three to four weeks, a majority of hospitals say they have witnessed a significant increase in the demand for hospital beds among patients suffering from the mosquito-borne disease. It is self-limiting in most cases and managed well with symptomatic management but, the doctors say, they have been getting cases where ignorance to the warning signs in cases of febrile illnesses led to serious complications. “We had an 18-year-old patient in the emergency last week. He presented with persistent vomiting, pain in the abdomen and massive internal bleeding. Tests confirmed the patient, a resident of Faridabad, was suffering from dengue,” Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor, department of medicine at AIIMS, said. He added that the patient had high fever and pain in the abdomen for two days but he did not get tested for dengue and kept taking medicines prescribed by a local doctor even as the symptoms worsened. “Most people make this mistake. In case of febrile illness, they take over-the-counter medications and wait at home until the condition deteriorates. This is a major reason for serious complications and death in dengue cases. People should get basic blood tests done if the fever doesn’t subside in a day or two and visit a hospital if there are warning signs such as pain in the abdomen, bleeding from natural orifices, rapid fall in the platelet count or extreme weakness for example,” Dr Biswas said. For physicians, Dr Biswas said it was important to counsel the patient and tell him to watch out for the warning signs instead of prescribing medicines alone. “Dengue patients with severe symptoms usually pass on to a critical stage after three to four days of fever. If patients are properly managed during this phase, then chances of complications become very less and she or he may recover completely. However, once a patient falls into a critical stage then the chances of recovery reduces. The patient may take longer to recover and even die,” Dr Biswas said. Dr AC Dhariwal, advisor at National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), said the main symptom of dengue was fever, extreme pain in muscles and joints. “Most of the time dengue is a mild illness and can be recovered with symptomatic treatment by cold sponging, paracetamol, and a lot of fluids. Aspirin is not recommended in dengue for fever as it may cause bleeding. Bleeding spots on the skin, and blood in sputum, vomiting, urine, stool may also be seen in some patients. Pain in the abdomen may be an alert in dengue,” he said. Dr Dhariwal added that monitoring of blood pressure, hematocrit (a type of test to measure the viscosity of the blood- thick or thin), tourniquet test, urine output and fluid replacement was important in dengue case management. Dengue is endemic in India meaning low level of transmission is present in almost all the states and union territories. In north India, Dr Dhariwal said, an upsurge of dengue cases is seen from July-August onward while in South India, we see low level of transmission throughout the year and upsurge after monsoon rains. “In 2021, an upsurge of cases has been reported from some of the states because of various reasons. As per the investigation, upsurge seems to be due to circulation of the Dengue Virus Serotype-2, which is known to cause severe dengue cases,” the former head of NVBDCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dengue-stings-delhiites-hosp-beds-filling-up/articleshow/86692937.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

It was 451 cases on Thursday and 425 on Friday. Six deaths were registered on Friday, taking the toll to 16,116 so far. In the state, daily cases have stayed under 3,200 for the last five days. On Friday, the tally was 3,105 cases and 50 deaths. The number of critical cases in the city has been steadily decreasing, from over 400 a month ago to 264 on September 30. Only 10.9% of the 16,000-odd Covid beds are occupied in the city, according to the BMC dashboard. While 70,404 people are in home quarantine right now, BMC officials said the numbers are high because 20 close contacts of every positive patient is tested and recommended quarantine, if needed. Only 503 out of the 2,207 Covid ICU beds are occupied at the moment. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state government’s task force, said the Covid situation appears to be under control despite the initial rise in cases after relaxation of restrictions. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has covered 65% of its population with at least one dose of vaccine, and if it goes up to 75%, it could move towards herd immunity and the transmission rate, too, would come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-cases-down-only-11-beds-occupied/articleshow/86692930.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Kanpur businessman’s last SOS call to kin belie cops claim||LUCKNOW: The last SOS call by Kanpur businessman, Manish Gupta, to his nephew, Durgesh, in midst of the police raid in his Gorakhpur hotel room displays clarity of thought and alacrity in speech, punching holes in the police theory that he slumped on the floor in a sozzled state and died of injuries. In the recorded phone call accessed by TOI, Manish can be heard telling the policemen — Sir, aap faltu main haath mat uthaiye (don’t assault me without reason) and seconds later he was seeking help from Durgesh, saying Beta, baat kharaab ho rahi hai ab, maddad karo (the situation is getting out of hand, please help). When Durgesh asks Gupta to connect him to the cops, Manish said, he was being taken to the police station, and the call disconnects. In the 2-minute 12-second phone conversation, Manish doesn’t sound tipsy as claimed by cops. Manish’s wife Meenakshi told TOI she last spoke to her husband around 12:10am on September 28. “Manish told me somebody had barged into his hotel room and he would call later. Thereafter, I tried calling several times, but failed to connect,” she said. She said, Manish’s last call was to his nephew, Durgesh, around 12:15 am, which was found in the recording app of her husband’s cell phone, now in her possession. Manish is heard telling Durgesh “Humlog Gorakhpur mein hain dekho zara beta (We are in Gorakhpur, please attend the call). Humlog so rahe the aur achanak room mein yeh aaye hain (We were sleeping when they suddenly barged into the room). Where are they from, Durgesh please ask them. To which a cop is heard saying, Hum Ramgarhtal police station se aaye hain checking ke liye.” Durgesh is then heard saying, he would talk to SP Gorakhpur, before the call drops. Manish Gupta, 36, died of injuries during a police verification drive at a hotel in Gorakhpur’s Ramgarhtal area after Monday midnight. However, Manish’s friends accused police of inflicting injuries on him, which triggered his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/situation-getting-out-of-hand-bizman-last-sos/articleshow/86694968.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The 10-meter-wide underpass, which is being constructed as per the previous DPR to cross the Nehru Maidan Road, is nearing completion. The next phase of work has begun to extend the length of the underpass, so that pedestrians may cross the Rao and Rao Circle-Clock Tower stretch of road. Key features of the underpass include multiple entry or exit points on either side of the road, access paired with staircase and ramp for physically challenged, renovation of Gandhi Park into a plaza, generating commercial potential by dedicating spaces for kiosks within the plaza, and provision of space for commercial advertising and murals depicting city heritage along the underpass walls. With the first phase of underpass to cross the Nehru Maidan Road near the Mini Vidhan Soudha nearing completion, the Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has taken up the second phase of work. In this phase, the underpass will be extended further, for the pedestrians to cross the Rao and Rao Circle-Clock Tower Road stretch. Those who enter the pedestrian underpass from the entry point at Mini Vidhan Soudha may cross two roads, once both phases of work are completed. Mayor Premanand Shetty informed at a council meeting of the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) on Thursday, that a decision to extend the pedestrian underpass was taken at a board of directors meeting of the MSCL. In fact, opposition leader in the council A C Vinayaraj had pointed out that the work on the second phase of underpass is unscientific, and the height of the underpass is elevated five feet above the Rao and Rao Circle-Clock Tower road. He also pointed out that it will be difficult to construct an access point on the northern side of the road. He also blamed the MSCL, that the extension was not part of the original plan of the pedestrian underpass. Shetty, who is also the director of the MSCL, said that it was planned earlier, but was not taken up due to the cost factor. “Initially, only one phase of work was taken up, considering the cost of the project. Recently, the board meeting of the MSCL decided to commence the second phase,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/smart-city-pedestrian-underpass-to-be-extended/articleshow/86688652.cms||---
---||Delhi||North Delhi civic body to get more CCTVs for checks at parks, markets||NEW DELHI: To improve surveillance and maintenance of civic services, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) is planning to install CCTV cameras at its prominent parks, gardens and markets, and integrate them with its control and command centre in the next six months. The civic body is at present monitoring the services on roads and service lanes through cameras installed at 55 smart poles. Cameras installed at parking sites, especially in Connaught Place and neighbouring areas, are also attached to Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) and help in tracking illegally parked vehicles. As of now, 19 civic services are integrated with the complaint management/tracking system and more will be added to ensure better visibility on city governance, said officials during the live demonstration of ICCC on Friday. Explaining the operation of the centre, an official said, “To keep tabs on violators, we pass information from the centre to the department concerned for towing away vehicles. These cameras also help to check the status of garbage bins, damaging of public properties, roadside encroachments, etc.” Apart from surveillance and parking management, other services like solid waste management, street lighting, parking, sewage treatment plants, education, health care, safety, electric and water billings, etc, have been integrated with the system. “We have installed underground bins at all strategic locations and unlike conventional bins, which often give an ugly look when filled, these are barely visible on roads and can be cleaned conveniently. The sensor-based dustbins are connected to the command and control centre, and if not cleaned 80%, they send alerts to the centre. It helps us to know which dustbins have not been cleaned and to check garbage from spilling out. Waste collection trucks, which are equipped with GPS devices, can also be tracked from this centre,” said the official. The civic body has completed work over the project for replacing conventional meters with smart meters as well that can be read and supervised from ICCC. The system also allows consumers to know their meter readings on a real-time basis and accordingly, control the use of electricity in their homes. Besides monitoring civic services, ICCC will also help in keeping tabs on daily complaints. “Departments that fail to redress issues in a time-bound manner will automatically start showing red signs. We will also use the system to check the performance of the department after every 15 days,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-to-get-more-cctvs-for-checks-at-parks-markets/articleshow/86692972.cms||Vibha Sharma

Only 27 Covid casualties have been reported in September, the lowest since April last year. The total death toll in NMMC jurisdiction now has reached 1,929, while 1.07 lakh people have tested Covid positive so far. September has witnessed a case fatality rate of 1.60%. Barring April last year, the lowest monthly deaths since the pandemic struck in March 2020, were reported in January (35) and February (34) this year. With a surge in cases from March this year, 55 deaths were reported which later leaped to 194 in April, and 237 in May. With diminishing infectivity rate, the toll dropped to 145 in June, 80 in July and 70 in August. Zero fatality was reported for the first time on September 6 after 7 months.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Govt shielding cops as ‘payback’ for help in polls’, says Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Sharpening attack on the state government over its failure to arrest the policemen involved in the death of Kanpur businessman at a Gorakhpur hotel, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the BJP is sheltering wanted cops as a “payback to the administration that has secured victory for the party in panchayat polls”. He said despite video evidence of the Gorakhpur district police chief and district magistrate trying to dissuade the family of the deceased not to register a case against the accused cops, no action was initiated against them. “Isn’t it a fact that the Gorakhpur district police chief is related to a senior BJP leader which is why no action is being initiated against him,” he asked. “In a state which boasts of using bulldozers against criminals has conveniently failed to track an IPS officer who is also wanted in a heinous crime and is said to be absconding. The inspector involved in Kanpur businessman’s murder has had a shady past, still he was serving in Gorakhpur and is now on the run. People can easily see through all this,” the former UP CM said. He said all promises of probe were an eyewash. “The government is shielding them because it is the same administration that has ensured victory for the BJP in panchayat polls,” Akhilesh said, interacting with media persons in Lucknow. On a query related to a recent statement of a former Congress MLA that only SP could defeat the BJP in UP, Akhilesh said: “Ye bilkul sahi hai… SP hi BJP ko harane ke liye taiyyar hai (It is correct … only SP is ready to defeat BJP).” A host of former MPs and MLAs, including former Congress MLA Gayadin Anurag, former BSP MP Rizwan Zaheer and members of the Kinnar Mahasabha, joined the SP at the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-govt-shielding-cops-as-payback-for-help-in-polls/articleshow/86695001.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Schools prepare for reopening, but many unlikely to start from October 4||NAGPUR: As the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has granted permission to conduct physical classes for Std VIII-XII, various schools are preparing to welcome students back on campus. While very few might reopen from October 4 itself due to various formalities like getting parental consent, the ensuing weekend, completing full sanitization of schools etc, it does seem that the overall ‘mood’ among schools is to ultimately reopen. According to Zafar Khan, president of School Headmasters Charitable Association, schools will now reopen “because online classes are not for everyone”. “In our grant-in-aid schools, especially those in vernacular category, majority of the students were not able to access online classes. Some did not have smartphones, some did not have enough money to recharge while some had just one device for two or three children. In education, we have to think about the most disadvantaged child and then act,” said Khan. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association, said that parents have been in touch with teachers and are constantly asking about reopening. “So there’s no doubt that in almost all vernacular schools, students will be looking forward to coming back to classrooms,” he said. Gavhankar further said that students from middle income and below category are eager to attend physical classes. “Obviously, it has to do with the technology available at home to access online classes. So, schools which cater to such students will see high physical attendance,” said Gavhankar. While welcoming the decision, Ravindra Fadnavis, executive member of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal, feels there are a few challenges. “October 4 reopening may happen only in NMC schools and hardly a few from private, because of time paucity. NMC passed order yesterday (Thursday) night, so today (Friday) was the only working day available to us. Then October 2 is a public hoilday followed by Sunday. There is not enough time to get written consent from parents and even plan out the reopening,” said Fadnavis. Fadnavis also said that grant-in-aid schools lack the funds for sanitization of premises and hopes that NMC will provide the same. Vandana Benjamin, a senior academic, said, “For non-grant private schools which fall into budget category, the reopening plan will be tough. We don’t have funds for sanitization, RTE reimbursement has been slashed by 50% and regular fee collection is down. Reopening requires money, so many of us may not be able to reopen so soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-prepare-for-reopening-but-many-unlikely-to-start-from-oct-4/articleshow/86690698.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Coaching institutes too want nod for reopening||NAGPUR: As permission for reopening of schools and junior colleges has been granted, coaching institutes in the city say there’s no reason for them to be kept closed. Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) has written to both Nagpur municipal commissioner and district collector seeking permission to reopen and promised to follow all SOPs decided by the government. Rajnikant Bondre, president of ACI, said, “The age group of students who attend coaching institutes and those now allowed to return to school is the same. So, if those students can technically visit public places, go to resorts, restaurants and school, why can’t they attend coaching institutes.” ACI assured authorities that all safety protocols will be followed by the members. Bondre said, “As it is, our members do much more than the basic safety requirement. Before this too, when permission was granted to reopen, our members had ensured that all safety regulations were followed strictly.” Bondre feels the authorities must look at various dynamics of the coaching sector, to aid their decision on reopening. “Students who visit coaching classes are dedicated to achieving academic success. They are highly disciplined and focused on their goals. They follow every instruction given to them, so the situation can’t be compared to a group of students out in a public place,” he said, adding, “We will also be ensuring that only a certain number of students attend physically.” He added that coaching institutes themselves observe stringent rules. Bondre said, “Staff vaccination has been done, premises are being sanitized regularly and the number of students attending classes is also limited. We don’t have thousand students enrolled, as in a school, which makes it easier to handle the flow.” ACI’s meeting with local authorities did not yield any immediate results. Bondre said, “The local authorities said final decision will have to come from the state government, only then it can be implemented by either NMC or collectorate. Hence, we have requested the local authorities to pass on our memorandum to the state government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-institutes-too-want-nod-for-reopening/articleshow/86690721.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The state government has started engaging national and international level agencies to create a buzz for the mega event in the post-Covid world order. A key source close to the development informed, “The state government has approved appointment of qualified agencies for an aggressive marketing campaign for the Vibrant Summit. With only three months left for the event, the government wants to have a powerful international and national level campaign to attract world-class companies and global influencers from across the world.” “We are inviting all embassies of major countries, big business groups and chambers of industries to participate in the event. Major focus will be given on participating virtually in case physical participation at the event is not possible. The PMO (Prime Minister’s office) will finalise a detailed action plan for the event. There is a strong possibility of participation of country heads of two or three major countries. Government of India (GOI) is coordinating at top level, so it may take a few more days for final confirmation. Focus will be on quality outcomes rather on the number of footfalls,” added the sources. The source further said, “The state government may send delegations led by a few senior IAS officers to partner countries which have participated in the past and invite them to participate in the 2022 summit as well. All major departments and PSUs of the GOI will also participate in the business meet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-to-launch-major-drive-for-vibrant/articleshow/86690695.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Lucknow||UP: Jobless amid Covid, former banker takes to financial fraud||LUCKNOW: A man in his 30s, who took to financial fraud after losing his job as a banker in the pandemic, was arrested with two of his aides in Ghaziabad on Friday. According to the officials of UP STF who cracked the case, the accused, Mohammed Sharif, duped banks of lakhs of rupees. This is the second gang busted by the police where the mastermind was a young and educated person who took to crime after losing job during pandemic. Earlier, a gang of techies and management strategists was busted which used to dupe people by floating fake websites. ASP STF, Vishal Vikram Singh, said, “Mohammed Sharif, who was an executive in a private bank, lost his job last year. Out of work, he used his knowledge of banking to commit fraud. He roped in four persons – Pradeep Sharma, Ankush Gandhi and two others with identical names, Sumit Chauhan, to carry out fraudulent activities.” “The gang members opened accounts in a few banks in Lucknow in the names of the officials of some private companies. Thereafter, they used forged letterheads to divert money from the bank accounts of the companies to their private accounts,” he added. “In one such case, on July 5, Sharif posed as the regional manager of an automobile company and diverted Rs 33.25 lakh from the firm’s account in a bank in Ismailganj to his own account. He told the manager that he needed money urgently to help employees who have met with an accident,” the ASP said. The bank came to know about the fraud when the original manager of the company reached the bank to inquire about the diversion of funds. Later, the bank officials lodged an FIR. Acting on a tip-off, the STF arrested Sharif, Ankush Gandhi and Sumit Chauhan from Ghaziabad, while Pradeep Sharma and the other Sumit Chauhan are on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jobless-amid-covid-former-banker-takes-to-fin-fraud/articleshow/86695035.cms||---

The man was arrested after a seven-hour chase on Friday. A nine-member crime branch team of Faridabad police was in Haridwar on Thursday to arrest accused in a robbery case. According to police, on September 28, three armed men had allegedly looted a shop in Munjesar police station area of Faridabad. The case was being investigated by crime unit 30 of Faridabad police. During investigation, a police team managed to trace the location of the accused in Haridwar. Once in Haridwar, the team managed to detain four accused at a car parking near Har-ki-Pauri. They were waiting to nab the fifth accused who was scheduled to meet his accomplices there. Four of the accused — identified as Amit, Manish, Abhishek and Anshu — hail from Meetha village in UP’s Ballia district. According to Haridwar circle officer (CO) Abhay Singh, “Two accused, including Anshu, were being questioned in a car in which they had been apprehended. Anshu managed to whip out a pistol he had hidden under the car seat and shot constable Sandeep Kumar in the head. The team fired in retaliation and the accused was shot in the hand, but he managed to escape.” The 37-year-old constable was taken to the district hospital and then referred to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.

He was found hiding near a ghat on Friday morning after a seven-hour chase and arrested. “The accused is admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh for treatment of the bullet injury he suffered,” said the CO. All four accused have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Faridabad police, meanwhile, donated Rs 11 lakh to help out the family of the deceased constable. Kumar is survived by his wife, three children and his parents. A file will also be sent to the state government for compensation. Born in 1984 in Kathura village of Sonipat, Kumar had joined Haryana Police in 2013. The last rites of the constable will be performed in his native village with state honours, said Faridabad police commissioner Vikash Arora. “Every policeman is our family and we are saddened by this unfortunate incident.

---||Mangaluru||Online learning: Rural PU students struggle with competitive exams||MANGALURU: The pre-university college managements here are worried that online classes will shatter the dreams of rural students of cracking the CET, NEET, JEE and other entrance exams and tests. Students have not been able to concentrate due to the absence of offline coaching, they say. This was evident during the recently-announced CET, where only a few rural students have been able to make the cut. Earlier, when classes and coaching were held offline, rural students fared better, and were even able to secure ranks. Akash, (name changed), a science student from Belthangady, had a dream to join a professional course after scoring well in CET. “Now my dream has been shattered, as I have not secured enough marks to get into an engineering college,” he said. “Our students were able to secure ranks within 10,000 during the days before the pandemic. However, this year they have secured ranks that are above 40,000. The major reasons for this are the shift from offline learning to online, and students in rural areas were affected due to connectivity issues. Students from rural areas are the worst-hit, when compared to their counterparts from urban areas,” said Dayamani, principal, Shree Sharada Women’s PU College in Sullia. She added that Sullia taluk is the worst-hit taluk when it comes to internet connectivity and power cuts. “Some villages have less than 10 hours of power supply in a day. There is no network whenever there are power cuts. We used to conduct four hours of online coaching for CET. Students could attend only two hours of classes, as there were issues with data and connectivity,” she said. Since not many rural students have written the CET or have done badly, they have opted for other courses, including ITI and diploma. Yusuf, principal of Government PU college, B Mooda, Bantwal taluk, says it’s not just online classes that are an issue, but students are also facing financial issues. “Many rural students did not register to take competitive exams, as their homes were reeling under financial crisis. They would not have been able to pay for a seat ,even if they secured a good rank,” he said. “Every year we collect data of students who appear for the CET, but this year it’s not available, since candidates have not kept us informed about their registration,” said the head of an aided college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/online-learning-rural-pu-students-struggle-with-competitive-exams/articleshow/86688715.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

While launching the Milma Gomathi gold cattle feed gift coupon scheme, which offers benefits worth more than Rs 3 crore for dairy farmers, at Milma Bhavan here, the minister said the government is also mulling to come out with a project for producing the ingredients of cattle feed in the state which would ensure high quality cattle feed at affordable prices for dairy farmers. “Through the proposed bill, we are planning to implement a quality control regime to ensure the standard of cattle feed and supply of it to farmers,” Chinchurani said. “The frequent rise in prices of cattle feed is a burden on farmers. We are unable to produce sufficient quantities of cattle feed here due to non-availability of ingredients. Now the government is looking into the possibilities of producing the ingredients within the state itself to address the issue. We have to reduce the input cost to attract more farmers to the dairy sector. Also, more projects aimed at the welfare of farmers need to be drawn up,” she said. On the occasion, the minister handed over the model gift coupon to Milma chairman K S Mani. He said the gift coupon scheme was launched as part of Milma’s promotional activities to support the hard-pressed farmers as it will help them reduce the production cost. With each sack of Milma gold cattle feed, the dairy farmers will get a gift coupon worth Rs 250, which can be used for buying Milma’s milk products and Milmamin mineral mixture. Under this scheme, Milma is planning to sell more than Rs 3 crore-worth products and Milmamin to dairy farmers through milk cooperative societies across Kerala. The gift coupon scheme will be available from October 1 to December 31. Dairy farmers can avail their coupons till February 28, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-mulls-bill-to-ensure-quality-of-cattle-feed/articleshow/86661739.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bookie held says ‘made scapegoat at Waze’s behest’||MUMBAI: Naresh Gaur, an accused in the case of planting explosives in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran, filed a bail application on Friday before a special NIA court contending that there was “not a shred of evidence” against him. The prosecution has attributed his role in the case to procuring SIM cards for the prime accused, now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze. In his plea through advocate Aniket Nikam, Gaur, a cricket bookie, said that he has been booked in the case merely on the basis of “surmises and conjectures.” He said that he was made a scapegoat at the behest of Sachin Waze. He claimed that he had no knowledge about the purpose for which the purported SIM cards were procured by Waze. He said that procuring these SIM cards was the only role attributed to him, and hence he should be granted bail. His plea will be heard on October 13. Meanwhile, Waze’s lawyer Raunak Naik told the court that it had received a letter dated September 30 from Dr Kamlesh Jain, a cardiothoracic surgeon from Wockhardt hospital, intimating “to defer” his discharge by two-three days. Waze has undergone surgery and is in the hospital. Another accused in the case, former encounter specialist and police officer Pradeep Sharma, filed a plea for home food and for transfer from the Taloja prison to Thane prison, and the court said that it would hear his plea on October 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bookie-held-says-made-scapegoat-at-wazes-behest/articleshow/86693045.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Yantra India Ltd inherits huge assets; outgo exceeding income||NAGPUR: A new public sector undertaking came into existence in the city on Friday. Yantra India Limited (YIL) is among the seven defence PSUs created out of the ordnance factory board (OFB). Headquartered at Nagpur, the company has been formed out of the erstwhile ordnance factory Ambajhari (OFAJ), clubbed with seven other factories. As a government corporation, YIL will have to be financial independent and viable. As it inherits assets worth Rs11,000 crore, a thin order book is also one of the challenges faced by the new company. YIL manufactures components like shells of various of ammunition ranging from small caliber weapons to that for artillery and armoured. One of the main items include the Pinaka rockets, shells for 155mm Bofors guns, 130 mm artillery guns and tanks. Sources said that there was a drastic cut in the order in the last few years, hitting the viability. The order in terms of value was reduced to almost half. This hampered the operating ratio, hitting the margins. At present, the expenditure exceeds the revenue by a considerable margin. Source say this can be made up by more orders. At present, the army is the major buyer of the items. Although the new PSUs can supply to the private sector, for the first five years, first preference would be between the erstwhile factories now new undertakings. The major setback was drastic reduction in the orders for the high caliber ammunition as the demand from the army itself had gone down. The ordnance factories also have been maintaining a war reserve capacity which entails a major cost. This is an additional capacity kept ready considering that the production may have to be scaled during wartime. “Even if it not utilized, there is a fixed cost in maintaining the capacity. This is one of the major cost component for the new DPSUs,” said sources. For example, a substantial investment was made for manufacturing a type of rocket. This was made on projections of a huge requirement. However, the actual indent was around 25% of it. The idle capacity adds to the cost. Sources said, “The PSUs may need support in terms of orders during the initial period till it searches new markets or comes up with other products. A new mandate is making composite metal for the spacecraft and axles for railways. This would need fresh investment.” “The DPSUs also need to a get a level playing field with the private sector, by having flexible procedures,” insisted a source. The private sector has its own freedom to cut costs. Under the previous set, units like OFAJ used to earlier make the empty shells and rockets which were sent for filling to other factories include the one in Chandrapur. Now, the filling factories are part of another DPSU—Munitions India Limited (MIL). So now, YIL will be supplying the shells to MIL and raise a bill. MIL in turn will pay the company based on realizations from the army or any other buyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yantra-india-ltd-inherits-huge-assets-outgo-exceeding-income/articleshow/86690747.cms||Shishir Arya

Minority welfare minister Mohsin Raza also wrote to DM Abhishek Prakash — also the chairman of Husainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) — calling for an inquiry. Shia cleric Maulana Saif Abbas said, “Bada Imambara is a religious monument and not a tourist place. Action should be taken against officials concerned.

Special officers should be deployed at our religious places so that such incidents do not recur.” General secretary of the All India Shia Personal Law Board, Maulana Yasoob Abbas, said: “The sanctity of our religious places is being breached. The district magistrate is the chairman of HAT but no rules are being followed. This is condemnable that HAT is not able to perform its duty of protecting the sanctity of our places of worship.

The BJP has been in power in the civic body with a slender majority, while the state capital has had a strong Congress voter base for several years. With recent delimitation having been implemented in Gandhinagar and several neighbouring villages included within limits of the municipal corporation, the BJP looks to make big gains in the civic body. The entry of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the electoral fray has added a new dimension to the GMC contest, where seats have traditionally been shared between the BJP and Congress. AAP leader Manish Sisodia, who led a roadshow in Gandhinagar earlier this week, claimed AAP will sweep the civic poll of the state capital. The GMC election is significant because it will be the firs electoral test for chief minister Bhupendra Patel. Gandhinagar lok sabha seat is also represented by union home minister Amit Shah and GMC is part of the larger LS constituency of Gandhinagar. Importantly, Gandhinagar city is home to a large number of government employees. The maiden election of GMC was held in 2011 and the Congress secured a majority. However three councillors, including the mayor defected to the BJP, giving it power in the GMC. In the 2016 election as well, there was a tie between the BJP and Congress. One councilor defected to the BJP, giving it a majority in the civic body. Voting will take place on Sunday, October 3 and counting of votes will be done on October 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gandhinagar-civic-body-election-to-be-held-on-sunday/articleshow/86690762.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||‘Why did you allow houses to be built on landfill site?’||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday sought a reply from the Anand municipality on why permission was granted for construction of houses and bungalows in the vicinity of a landfill site that was earmarked three decades ago. The HC query came in response to a PIL filed four years ago, seeking solution to the problem of pollution caused by the solid waste dump on Lambhvel Road. The landfill site was earmarked in the early 1990s and since then housing colonies have come up nearby the place and as the municipality began dumping the waste, people living in the colonies began complaining. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said that the situation prima facie appears very grim, and life for any citizen residing in the nearby area would be miserable. “This would lead to not only air but soil pollution also. This will have its own effect on ground water. We would like to know if this place has been earmarked as landfill site past three decades, then how come permission was granted for construction of bungalows and houses in the vicinity?” the court asked. The court further said that the government and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) have got two options – either continue with the disposal of solid waste at the very same site and allow people to live a miserable life at the cost of their health or to consider of an alternate land at a particular distance from the town. The HC issued notice to the GPCB seeking its reply by October 8. GPCB has been asked to depute a team of officials to undertake inspection and file a report on whether solid waste disposal is taking place strictly in accordance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The court has said that the municipality should come forward with concrete proposal for shifting of the landfill site to ensure public health. The HC has ordered Anand municipality’s chief officer to remain present during the next hearing to answer certain queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-did-you-allow-houses-to-be-built-on-landfill-site/articleshow/86690837.cms||---

The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati expressed its satisfaction at Bhuj municipality’s decision to drop the project of beautification of the Hamirsar Lake, but also said that the court was upset with such projects which not only could have damaged the 450-year old structure around the water body but also substantially disturbed migratory birds and rich biodiversity. The judges said, “It is very very unfortunate to take notice of the fact that all the glorious history of Hamirsar Lake, the Bhuj municipality in the name of beautification floated a project knowing fully well that they are not supposed to tinker with a water body.” In July 2019, the high court had stayed the project. On Friday, while disposing the PIL, the HC directed the municipality “to demolish every bit of construction put up so far in the lake within three months” and sought a compliance report. While the municipality asserted that no construction has been put up, the HC insisted, “Nothing should remain. The foundation, if any put up, has to be removed without causing dmage to the Lake and natural habitat. Even if major work has to be undertaken to remove construction, do it.” The judges also said that they would like to visit the place to check whether the beautiful lake has been disturbed or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-removal-of-all-construction-in-bhujs-historic-hamirsar-lake/articleshow/86690901.cms||---
---||Delhi||No permit to enter Delhi made us block border, say protesting farmers||NEW DELHI: The farmers sitting in protest for almost a year against the three contentious farm laws enacted by the central government insisted on Saturday that they had not impeded the movement of vehicles at Singhu border.  Their remonstration came after the Supreme Court said on Saturday that they were strangulating the capital. The farmers argued that Delhi Police did not allow them to enter the city, thus forcing them to sit-in at the border. Holding aloft a flag, 63-year-old Sadhu Singh and his 70-year-old friend, Nichatra Singh, listened stolidly to the allegations that they had stopped vehicular movement on the highway. “We have never blocked the road. It was the police that put up the barricades,” declared Sadhu, adding that they had, in fact, helped to clear the traffic snarls on several occasions. Many other protesting farmers nodded their heads in corroboration. At the protest site, langar was being distributed and a man dressed as Mahatma Gandhi was roaming around, probably in respect of Gandhi Jayanti on Saturday.  He identified himself as Santosh Gandhi, a resident of Madhya Pradesh. “I urge people to support the farmers’ demands," he said. Subegh Singh, 75, reiterated that the agitators hadn’t created trouble for the local citizenry. “We regularly distribute food to poor people and to labourers and their children. They come to the protest site to get food," he said. Meanwhile, 80-year-old Gurmeet Singh, who has been at the agitation site since November last year, quietly, but firmly, said, “We will not leave this place until all our demands are met.” Meanwhile, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the farmers’ organisation spearheading the protest, alleged that the highways had been blocked by the BJP government’s police. "The central government knows that the protest can be resolved if it accepts the legitimate demands of the farmers. But it has chosen not to do so, even though hundreds of farmers have been martyred,” an SKM member said. Yudhvir Singh, SKM leader, said they wanted to shift to Delhi's Ramlila Maidan to stage the protest but were stopped by police at the borders, which they then decided to turn into agitation spots.  Asked whether the protest was causing problems for local people, Yudhvir retorted, “We are getting massive support from the people.” He also said that farmers regularly rotated their presence at the borders, with some returning home for farming duties. "In their absence, new faces join the protest," said Yudhvir. He added that all precautions had been taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. However, on Saturday, TOI observed no mask-wearing for physical distancing among the protesters. Brijendra Kumar Yadav, DCP (Outer North), said commuters had been advised alternative routes from Singhu border. "Due to the protest, we have also had to divert vehicles,” he said.  Yadav added that after they were taken by surprise by the events of January 26, police had to put barricades to ensure order and to prevent reckless behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-permit-to-enter-city-made-us-block-border/articleshow/86716679.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Hyderabad||Trading licence blues hit Secunderabad Cantonment Board big revenue dreams||SECUNDERABAD: While commercially the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) area has grown on similar lines as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), the two neighbours are miles apart as far as ease of doing business and revenue generation is concerned. According to SCB health & sanitation wing records, there are about 2,000 commercial units, but the illegal ones are many times that. A rough estimate puts the turnover of such businesses at Rs 250 crore per annum. Inability to tap into this has deprived the fund-starved board of crucial revenue to fix its infrastructure woes in at least some measure. “If every trader obtained a trade licence, we would get Rs 5-7 crore,” SCB senior superintendent M Devender told TOI. While earlier the waiting period for a trade licence in SCB ran into months, it’s only now that the new E-Chhawani portal has cut it down drastically. Traders TOI spoke to said that a merger could help resolve their business woes. “We are sanctioning them within a week if traders upload all documents. Of the 1,200 who have applied, we have sanctioned 460 trade licences through E-Chhawani,” an SCB official said SCB charges fresh and renewal fee starting from Rs 100 to as high as Rs 2 lakh per annum based on trade, structure and area. Officials said that they earned about Rs 1.5 crore in trade licences. Though things are getting back to normal after more than a year of pandemic-induced closures, traders in SCB are still finding it tough to get back on their feet. Many had left premises due to high rents to run their trade from footpaths, while others have seen their profits dwindle with rising material costs. Over 40% buildings are vacant in Vikrampuri Colony (Karkhana), Trimulgherry, Lal Bazar, Bowenpally and Bolarum. This has directly hit SCB revenue through trade licences. “Business is totally dull. Before the pandemic, I earned Rs 10-15 lakh per month. It is down to Rs 2-5 lakh,” said G Shyamal Reddy, a hardware trader in Bowenpally. While books and stationery vendor K Raghupati said, “My business has been severely hit due to educational institutions being shut due to the pandemic. It’s recovering, but slowly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trading-licence-blues-hitscb-big-revenue-dreams/articleshow/86690937.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Lucknow||Unit at KGMU to remove pathogens from blood products||Lucknow: A machine to remove pathogens from blood products will be installed in the blood transfusion and medicine department of King George’s Medical University soon. The machine will remove a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses such as HIV, parasites such as malaria, and white blood cells in blood products. This will reduce the risks of disease transmission and side-effects from blood transfusions. Making this announcement on Friday at a function to mark National Voluntary Blood Donation Day, vice-chancellor Lt Gen Bipin Puri claimed that KGMU will be the first in the country to install such a machine. “We are in talks with state authorities for installation and it will be available in four-five months,” he added. Head of transfusion medicine department Prof Tulika Chandra said, “Patients with low immunity, blood disorders, cancer, and transplant are vulnerable to various diseases transmitted through blood transfusion. They will be benefited with the arrival of the machine.” Meanwhile, 43 voluntary blood donors/motivators and NGOs working for blood donations were facilitated. Governor Anandiben Patel, the chief guest, said, “Every eligible student should donate blood at least twice a year. Special camps should be organized at universities for this purpose.” Special guest and medical education minister Suresh Khanna said, “All medical colleges will be directed to raise awareness and motivate people for blood donation.” Law minister Brijesh Pathak said voluntary blood donation camps should be organized often.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/unit-at-kgmu-to-remove-pathogens-from-blood-products/articleshow/86695134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||PU students close ranks to get cases against protesters quashed||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Students and civil society members staged a protest outside the office of the vice-chancellor, demanding quashing of the FIR registered against four student leaders, Amandeep Kaur from PSU (Lalkaar), Pargat Singh, Rahul Kumar and Sarvotam Rana from NSUI. The FIR was registered after protesters gheraoed the V-C, sparking outrage. Those who addressed the gathering said that the fact that the FIR was registered a month after the incident indicated that it was a fabricated case filed to suppress the voice of protesting students. They said that the full video of the incident was in the public domain. The video, they said, showed faculty members raising slogans against the vice-chancellor and then student leaders confronting him and raising slogans. They said that the students did not touch the VC the whole time and that the charges of physical assault and causing hurt were false. They said that the FIR had been filed to intimidate students. Amandeep Singh from PSU (Lalkaar), who convened the protest said, “We will not be intimidated by such petty actions. Already, we are facing trial in a case filed against us in the 2017 fee hike struggle. Police cases could not deter us from fighting for our rights. We will continue to challenge anti-student agendas of authorities and BJP-RSS stooges on campus. We will not let authorities use false police cases against students any more. We will not go to Court for bails or trial. This time we will struggle till we get the case quashed by our unity.” Students against whom the FIR has been launched also addressed the gathering. Aman from PSU (Lalkaar) and Pargat from NSUI said people from all walks of life had offered their support. Wardens from the authority reached the protest site and a memorandum was submitted for immediate quashing of the FIRs. JSAC ended the protest with the declaration that if the authorities did not quash the FIR soon, then they would intensify the struggle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-students-close-ranks-to-get-cases-against-protesters-quashed/articleshow/86690891.cms||---

The panel chaired by former Neeri director Tapan Chakrabarti permitted Sanatan Dharma Yuvak Sabha to hold the Ravan Dahan programme, which is organized every year to celebrate the Vijayadashami (Dussehra) festival, at KP. The event will be held on October 15 this year. Permission has been granted for preparation of the event from October 5 to October 16. However, parking of only two-wheelers will be allowed inside KP for the event. The panel has asked the organizer to erect barricades around the bandstand, which is also a heritage structure. It has also asked the organizer to obtain a no-objection certificate from MahaMetro as the KP Metro station has already started functioning. The panel had declined permission earlier this year, following which the organization approached the high court. The panel also asked for submission of development plan of Zero Mile and Kasturchand Park before it, and asked the authorities concerned to clean the bushes that have grown at Zero Mile and KP. The panel asked Gandhibagh zone’s executive engineer Dhananjay Mendulkar to visit and inspect whether there is any unauthorized construction on the premises of Murlidhar temple on Kelibagh road, Mahal. If found, necessary action under Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act should be initiated, the panel noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heritage-panel-okays-ravan-dahan-at-kp/articleshow/86690909.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||IT employees use lockdown to hone skills in AI, ML, data sciences||Hyderabad: If working from home has its own benefits, scores of IT employees from the city seems to have done exactly that as they pursued various post-graduate, certificate and diploma programmes in order to hone their skills during the pandemic. Industry leaders and many employees said artificial intelligence, machine learning and data sciences were among the most sought after courses. After working at the Tata Consultancy Services for nearly two years, Pranavi Krishnamsetty a post-graduate programme (PGP) in data science engineering during the lockdown in order to advance her career prospects. “I attempted the digital recruitment test in TCS in January 2021 and was selected for a data sciences role. It also doubled my package as my role was changed,” said Krishnamsetty. Industry experts admit that those early in their career are preferring PGP because that gives them an edge over others. “Many engineering students who have pursued BTech in mechanical, civil or electrical engineering, joined IT firms without having any digital skill set. We see that an uptick in number of such students coming forward to pursue certificate/diploma courses in emerging technologies to better than chances into digital roles,” said Arjun Nair, co-founder of Great Learning, an ed-tech company that offers such courses. It is not just those early in their career but also those in the middle level who enrolled themselves for these courses. “The average range of those enrolling for PGP and certificate programmes was 32 years on our platform,” said Santanu Paul, chief executive officer of TalentSprint, an ed-tech startup that offers such courses. “Working from home gave people great flexibility to pursue these courses at their own pace. We offer courses during weekends too,” he added. Companies too are promoting these courses among its employees. “At any given time, over 90 per cent of our employees are engaged in what we call continuous learning. We have seen a rising interest in leadership and culture management programmes,” added Rashi Srivastava, executive vice president of Qentelli, a US-based technology firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/it-employees-use-lockdown-to-hone-skills-in-ai-ml-data-sciences/articleshow/86690962.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Kolkata||Cops hit the ground after Calcutta high court Puja order||KOLKATA: Hours after a Calcutta high court order barred the entry of visitors into Durga Puja pandals, Kolkata Police brass at Lalbazar asked officers to ensure compliance on the ground. The OCs of respective police stations passed on the instruction to all Puja organizers in their jurisdiction, urging them to ensure that everything is in place before the final round of inspection is carried out next week. On Friday, DC (north) Joyeeta Basu visited some topdraw Pujas in north Kolkata like Bagbazar, Kumartuli Sarbajanin, Kumartuli Park and Jagat Mukherjee Park to check if the idol could be viewed without people having to enter the pandals. Organizers of the pujas at Jagat Mukherjee Park and Ahiritola Sarbojonin assured her that the entrance to the parks would be shut. Officers from Gariahat PS were also quick to act. Hours after the order, they were out with tape in hand to demarcate the 10m zone outside the Singhi Park puja pandal beyond which visitors cannot step in. This is being done as police have to set up a no-entry barricade there. A similar exercise will be carried out at Ekdalia Evergreen on the other side of Gariahat Road. In Behala, where a puja had been temporarily shut last year for flouting the order, cops reminded organizers to adhere to the rules at a coordination meeting held in Sarat Sadan. It is not only police that has swung into action. Fire brigade officers, too, strategised on Friday on how to ensure a safe Puja. “With no entry inside pandal, we will ensure there is no loose wiring around the periphery as these areas may get crowded. We are especially training and raising awareness among organizers on the dangers of possible electrocution due to waterlogging,” a fire officer said. In addition, fire brigade bikes will keep a constant vigil around big pandals. Apart from the existing fire stations, 22 temporary fire stations will be set up for the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-hit-the-ground-after-hc-puja-order/articleshow/86691002.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Presently working as chief vigilance officer in Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), Hyderabad, Upender has collected over 500 rare stamps and postal covers having Gandhi’s famous quotes. Among the rare collections include Gandhi as a lawyer in Johannesburg, a 116-mile walk through Bengal to try to halt Hindu-Muslim strife, the last meeting between Gandhi, Nehru and Sardar Patel, spinning yarn, salt march, launching of civil disobedience to protest British rule in India, seven vows of Mahatma Gandhi, special cover on martyrs day with a photo of Gandhi and stamp booklets of Gandhi released by the postal department. Rare stamps released by different countries are also in Upender’s’ collection. Upender was a director in the postal department. Filananias-2021, Filatelia Ananias virtual exhibition, which was conducted in Brazil, honoured Upender with a silver medal on the theme of ‘Quotes of Mahatma Gandhi-A Philatelic Tribute.’ He took part in a virtual exhibition from India. “Perhaps, this exhibit is unique as I did not come across any such exhibit in the country,” Upender told TOI. He said over a decade, he has been collecting philatelic material, exclusively Gandhi stamps and postal covers, having his quotes. “It is a unique experiment to showcase Mahatma Gandhi through rare philatelic collections,” he explained. He admitted that collecting a variety of philatelic material on Mahatma Gandhi having quotes was a tough task, but he could succeed because of his passion in philately field. On the occasion of Gandhi’s birth anniversary, Upender remembered Gandhi and said, “I am paying a philatelic tribute to Gandhiji through my rare collection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-philatelist-reveals-rarecollection-of-gandhi-stamps/articleshow/86690989.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Kolkata||Lessons learnt last year, ‘prepared’ Puja clubs design pandals keeping Calcutta high court ruling in mind||KOLKATA: When Calcutta high court had announced a ban on entry of visitors last year, several Durga Puja organizers had experienced a panic attack. With the elaborate pandals inaccessible, sponsorship deals fell through and they stared at financial disaster. Many said they were completely heart-broken at the huge effort put in to showcase a grand Puja going to waste. But this year, most organizers weren’t flustered when the HC announced that it was reinforcing the curbs that had been in place last year. Indeed, most were anticipating it and had prepared accordingly. Ballygunge Cultural and Samaj Sebi had all anticipated the court to take a firm stand on the Covid issue and had planned accordingly. “The court ruling is not a shocker this year. We were mentally prepared for it. Accordingly, we asked the decorators to design an open pandal that can be viewed from a distance. Of course, the Goddess will be well protected from rain,” said Samaj Sebi treasurer Chandan Basu. Taking a lesson from last year’s experience, Bhowanipore 75 Pally Puja that is located in a lane has brought the pandal forward near the main road so that people can view the idol as they pass by. “The pandal used to be situated 110ft into the lane. That was fine till Covid struck. This year, we have brought the pandal forward by 80ft. So the exclusion zone begins at the main road from where people can view the idol clearly,” said committee secretary Subir Das. Ballygunge Puja Samity Maddox Square has traditionally had pandals that are open on three sides. However, there had been a problem last year as the short 7.5ft idol was difficult to view from outside. “We had initially planned to hold the puja in the club room and hence the size of the idol was reduced. But when we had to shift outside following the state SOP mandating that three sides be kept open, there was a mismatch. This year, we have increased the idol height to 13.3ft and have raised the platform so that it can be viewed clearly from a distance,” said puja committee secretary Ranajit Chakraborty. “We had positioned the idol near an entrance last year so that people could view from outside. But it was a challenge. Therefore, we did not take a chance this year and have created an open pandal with the idol placed on a 7ft pedestal so that it can be clearly viewed from the road,” said Kumartuli Sarbajanin convenor Debasis Bhattacharya. At Kashi Bose Lane, too, the pandal has been created in such a way that people can just walk through the lane and view the pandal in the adjoining ground. “The movement of pedestrians will be one way through the lane. In any case, the Kolkata Police Asan form had mandated that pandals have to be open on three sides,” added puja joint secretary Pradipta Nan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lessons-learnt-last-yr-prepared-puja-clubs-design-pandals-keeping-hc-rules-in-mind/articleshow/86691023.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Durga Puja organizers to follow 2020 template for rituals||KOLKATA: Durga Puja organizers have decided to follow last year’s restrictions during the Puja rituals and were in sync with the court order announced on Friday. All the major Puja organizers said they had completed double vaccination of all key individuals — priests, helping hands, dhakis, pandal decorators and electricians — who would have access to the pandal to ensure a degree of safety among those involved in the day-to-day Puja activities. Last Ashtami, Puja organizers had increased the number of batches for ‘anjali’ with some of them demarcating rows and columns beyond the restricted zone for the devotees to stand while offering the prayers. Also, most of them had set up loud-speakers so that the matras could be clearly heard by devotees. Some had even installed a giant screen so that the face of the Goddess was visible during ‘anjali’. “We had decided to follow last year’s template for ‘anjali’. Perhaps, the rows would have been allowed closer to the Goddess. But with the court now reimposing last year’s restrictions, the setup will be 10m away,” said Ballygunge Puja Samity Maddox Square secretary Ranajit Chakraborty, adding that there would be no public announcements made on Anjali timings to prevent crowding. “We will encourage people in the neighbourhood, particularly senior citizens, to make the offering from the verandah in their homes,” he added. At Hatibagan Sarbajanin Durgotsav, the organizers have asked households who have been associated with the Puja for decades to submit names of women who wish to participate in ‘anjali’ to enable them to prepare a list of people who would be allowed entry into the pandal on Ashtami. “We will also cater to those who wish to offer prayers from a distance,” said puja committee secretary Saswat Bose. At Bhowanipore 75 Palli, there will be no cut fruit prasad and no sprinkling of ‘Santi jal’ after the Anjali. “For Sandhi Pujo, only a select few women will be present. The rest can view it on a giant screen,” said Subir Das, secretary of the puja committee. Many puja organizers have already curtailed Sindoor Khela. At Deshapriya Park, Durgotsav committee secretary Sudipto Kumar said women would be allowed one at a time to smear vermilion on the face of the Goddess but have been asked not to do so among themselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/organizers-to-follow-2020-template-for-rituals/articleshow/86691048.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Speaking on ‘Politics and Feminism in India’ at the opening session of Manthan Samvad, on Friday – the annual convention of Manthan, a platform of for public discourse – she suggested how feminists are often painted as antagonists by the mainstream political class. “As a result, the social and political freedom of women today is in danger of vanishing...,” Krishnan said adding how, along with empowering and uplifting women, it is also important to “disempower patriarchy”. “Why do women always have to serve someone? Why can’t women just be without any agenda? That is an idea that the political class does not want to touch,” Krishnan said. The Samvad started with a tribute to Ajay Gandhi, co-founder of Manthan, who passed away on September 23 while undergoing cancer treatment.

Police have made no arrests in the case which was lodged after a complaint was filed by Mahagenco. Apart from changing the registration number by tempering with the plate, the trucker is learnt to have tried to manipulate the GPS location by switching the vehicle location of the genuine truck to one having a fake number plate. Police said transporter Chhabi Singh was trying to deliver low-grade coal to KTPS after mining it from Mahalgaon in Mouda, though he was supposed to supply high-grade coal from Western Coalfield Limited mines in Gondegaon, Kanhan. In the early hours of September 28, Khaparkheda police had received information that a truck with the registration number tempered was trying to deliver coal at KTPS. The truck had a sticker on its registration number plate to conceal the original number. During investigation, Khaparkheda police found out that the high-grade coal brought from Gondegaon in a truck was parked at Bhanegaon T-point. Another truck carrying low-grade coal, which had the sticker of the registration number of the one parked at Bhanegaon T-point, was heading to deliver the consignment at KTPS, rendering it a substantial loss due to the fraud. Senior police inspector PM Bhatkar of Khaparkheda police said cops had tested and got the results of the coal samples from the two trucks. “We have found that the truck coming from Mahalgaon had poor quality coal and prima facie was not supposed to be delivered to KTPS. The one which had come from Gondegaon was of the desired quality,” he added. Bhatkar said the transport contractor and many others are under our scanner for this fraud. “We are investigating the case thoroughly and will arrest those guilty after all evidence is collected,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-register-offence-in-mahagenco-complaint-yet-to-make-arrests/articleshow/86690966.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||104 STPs set up to clean rivers under Namami Gange||Lucknow: As part of its ambitious plan to clean up rivers, with special focus on the Ganga under Namami Gange Scheme, the Uttar Pradesh government has set up 104 sewage treatment plants with a combined capacity of 3,298.84 MLD (million litres per day). A government spokesperson said the infrastructure was aimed at ensuring clean flow in rivers like Ganga, Gomti, Saryu, Yamuna and Rapti. “Other than cleaning of rivers and preventing untreated sewage from falling into them, efforts are also being made to provide domestic sewerage connections in cities,” the spokesperson said. “Among the various projects taken up under Namami Gange, the government has provided an STP and sewerage line in Anupshahr which is preventing the discharge of polluted water into the Ganga. The work of laying the sewerage line was done at a cost of Rs 78 crore,” he said. In Lucknow, the Gomti was dredged to remove silt accumulated on the surface. An STP of 120 MLD capacity is being set up to treat sewage from Haider Canal. STPs have also been set up in Ghaziabad, Meerut, Agra, Loni, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Pilkhua, Muzaffarnagar, Rampur, Gorakhpur, Sultanpur and Ayodhya. “Under the cheme, the government initiated the Sisamau Nala Project and has completely closed the 128-year-old drain in Kanpur which was a major reason for contamination of Ganga. Meanwhile, around 140 MLD of sewage from this drain is being tapped and treated at the 80 MLD Bingawan STP and 60 MLD at Jajmau STP. Through this system, pollution into Ganga has been reduced and water quality has improved,” spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/104-stps-set-up-to-clean-rivers-under-namami-gange/articleshow/86695191.cms||---
---||Delhi||Do not politicise Chhath Puja: CM||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday backed the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s decision to ban Chhath celebrations in public places and appealed to politicians to not politicise the issue. “People need to get into water during Chhath Puja. If a single person is Covid positive, they will infect the water and others may get infected. I want the (Covid) situation to improve further and that the people celebrate Chhath Puja with pomp and show. But the situation is currently adverse. Delhi has witnessed four Covid waves and the last wave left so many people dead. We do not want the situation to deteriorate again,” Kejriwal said during a function at Delhi assembly. “I want to appeal to people of other political parties to not politicise the issue. They should convince people that the restrictions are much needed for their and their family members’ health,” said Kejriwal. North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari on Friday warned of protests if the ban is not lifted and stated that the order would be defied if permission is not given to hold the festival in public places like riverbeds. DDMA has banned Chhath Puja celebrations in public places, including at riverbanks, ponds, temples and public grounds due to prevailing Covid-19 situation. In an order on Thursday, DDMA, however, allowed public celebrations of Ramlila, Durga Puja and Dussehra while subjecting organisers to strict conditions. Meanwhile, Kejriwal unveiled an artwork ‘Jallianwala Bagh Smriti Chitra’ in the Delhi Assembly complex and remembered the immortal martyrdom of the ancestors who were martyred in Jallianwala Bagh. “I congratulate Speaker Shri Ram Niwas Goel for coming up with such a heartfelt commemoration to the Jallianwala Bagh. This artwork will continue to remind us of the pain and suffering our ancestors had to go through, the struggle they had to go through to bring freedom to our country,” the CM said. Replying to a question, Kejriwal said, “It is high time the Centre should agree to the demands of the farmers. There is no point in saying we’ll hold talks. The farmers have fixed, routine demands that are very valid. They should take back the three laws now.” The CM paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri at a function on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/do-not-politicise-chhath-puja-cm/articleshow/86716799.cms||AlokKNMishra

Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) too gave a call to farmers and farm unions to stage protests outside the residences of MPs and MLAs across Punjab and Haryana on Saturday. In Haryana’s Karnal district, BKU (Charuni) led a protest by farm activists. Protests were also staged at the grain markets of Shahabad and Thanesar in Kurukshetra district of Haryana. Arhtiyas, or commission agents, in Jagadhari and Karnal too opposed the Centre’s decision. SKM, a coalition of over 40 farmer unions which is spearheading the ongoing protest against three agri-marketing laws, said farmers will hold simultaneous protests in both states on Saturday. In Punjab, protests will be staged outside houses of Congress MLAs from 10am till the time the government would strat purchasing paddy. In Haryana, the offices of BJP-JJP MLAs and MPs, and district administrations, will be gheraoed, said SKM. In Jagadhari, which falls in Yamunanagar district, arhtiyas held a meeting outside the market committee office and warned the government of an agitation. In Karnal, farm activists led by BKU (Charuni) first held a protest outside the market committee office at Karnal grain market. They then locked the gate of the market committee office and raised slogans against the BJP-JJP government, demanding start of procurement as per the earlier schedule. BKU (Charuni), a constituent of SKM, has backed the protest call. BKU (Charuni) Karnal district president Jagdeep Singh Aulakh Aulakh announced that farmers would gherao the CM’s residence at Prem Nagar in Karnal on Saturday if the government failed to start paddy procurement at the earliest. In Kurukshetra district, farmers first protested at Thanesar grain market, then at Dr BR Ambedkar Chowk and later they parked their paddy-loaded tractor-trolleys inside circumambulation of Brahamsarovar, which were later removed. The farmers said if they do not find any space at grain markets, they will dry their crop in the Brahamsarovar. In Shahabad, farmers sat on a protest inside the office of sub-divisional magistrate. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Charuni) Yamunanagar district president Sanju Gundiana said they would gather at Jagadhri grain market at 10am and proceed with paddy-loaded tractor-trolleys to the residences of Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal and BJP’s Yamunanagar MLA Ghanshyam Dass Arora. “Nearly 30% paddy crop has arrived at the grain market, but the government delayed the procurement by 10 days,” he said. The protesting farmers said paddy was ready to harvest and thousands of quintals of the crop had arrived in grain markets. But on Thursday evening, just hours before the official procurement season was to start, the government issued a notification to defer the procurement by 10 days, causing resentment among the farming community. Aulakh said the government was delaying procurement to evade minimum support price and benefit private players. He added even deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had earlier announced to commence paddy procurement from September 25. It’s a step towards ending MSP, says Surjewala AICC general secretary and senior Haryana Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday criticised the Union and state governments for deferring the paddy procurement season while terming the move as a step towards ending the MSP and mandi system in the state. Surjewala claimed that delayed procurement of paddy is the most cruel and inhumane joke by Narendra Modi-led government in Centre and Khattar-Chautala government in Haryana. “Around 20 lakh metric tonnes of paddy is lying in the open in the mandis of the state. Just imagine the condition of farmers who are waiting for the procurement since September 25.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/procurement-farmers-protest-delay-skm-calls-for-stir-in-pb-hry-today/articleshow/86700981.cms||---

---||Allahabad||HC orders fair probe into torture of armyman by police||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Friday directed the state government and UP Police to ensure fair investigation in a matter of alleged humiliation and brutal torture of an ex-soldier by the UP Police, observing, “Harassment of a common man by public authorities is socially abhorring and legally impermissible. It may harm him personally but the injury to society is far more grievous.” While directing the state government to take immediate action in accordance with law against the accused policemen, the court further observed, “An ordinary citizen or a common man is hardly equipped to match the might of the state or its instrumentalities. A public functionary, if he acts maliciously or oppressively and the exercise of power results in harassment and agony, then it is not an exercise of power but its abuse. No law provides protection against it. He who is responsible for it must suffer it. But when it arises due to arbitrary or capricious behaviour then it loses its individual character and assumes social significance,” observed the court. Allowing a writ petition filed by Resham Singh, an ex-soldier of the Indian army alleging humiliation and brutal torture by the UP Police, a division bench comprising Justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Justice Piyush Agrawal directed the state government to conclude the investigation and departmental proceeding expeditiously, preferably within three months. The order also noted that though some action was taken against the accused policemen on the administrative side, the preliminary inquiry report directed by the superintendent of police has not yet been submitted even after three months. “This, prima facie, indicates casual, illegal and arbitrary approach of the respondents for the reasons best known to them,” the court stated. On May 2, the armyman Resham Singh, along with his mother and two sisters was going from Pilibhit to Lakhimpur Kheri when they were stopped by the police officials at around 9 am. The police then asked for the papers of the car in which they were travelling. Allegedly, since it was taking some time to sort out the papers, the police officials abused the victim and his mother and two sisters. The victim asked the police officials to not abuse them and also informed that he was a retired member of the armed forces. This infuriated the police who threatened the victim and his family members that they will teach them a lesson for life. They then started abusing and beating the victim with lathis. Allegedly, the police officials also beat his mother and sisters and took them to the police station without taking the assistance of any woman police officer. At the police station, the victim was disrobed and tied on a cot and brutally beaten up by the said police officials for two continuous hours. They also gave him third degree torture only to satisfy their ego, the petitioner alleged. Thereafter, he lodged an FIR against the erring officials and took treatment in the army hospital. A video of the said incident had gone viral on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-orders-fair-probe-into-torture-of-armyman-by-police/articleshow/86691084.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP: Now, BJYM national president Tejasvi Surya takes on Samajwadi Party with ‘Bhaijaan’ swipe||LUCKNOW: After chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Abba Jaan’ jibe, it was the turn of Tejasvi Surya, national president of Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM), to lash out at the previous Samajwadi Party for following the principle of “Bhaijaan ke saath... Mian ke vishwaas aur apna vikas” in an allusion to its minority appeasement policy. Surya made the remark while addressing the inaugural session of Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha working committee in Lucknow. “Unlike SP, the BJP follows the principle of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas,” he said, insisting it was only after Yogi assumed power that development of all sections of society picked up pace in UP. The fiery MP from Bangalore (South) also announced he and his team would visit all six organisational regions and 18 commissionerates to help BJP sweep elections. “UP elections have national repercussions. We will ensure BJP wins more seats than in 2017,” he said, taunting BSP and SP: “Haathi thak gaya hai...cycle puncture ho gayi hai”. The BJYM national chief also referred to senior SP leader and Rampur MP Azam Khan and BSP MLA from Mau, Mukhtar Ansari as “gangsters”, who were now behind bars. Invoking former chief minister late Kalyan Singh as a Hindutva icon who played a pivotal role in “saving” Indian civilisation, Surya said, the firebrand leader had “integrity, character and commitment”. “We, as functionaries of BJYM, need to follow the path shown by Kalyan ji,” Surya said, amid cheers from scores of BJYM workers gathered at the meet. At the same time, he credited PM Narendra Modi and scores of BJYM workers for fructification of the “500-year-old dream” of construction of Ram temple. The lawyer-turned-politician reiterated that the majority Hindu community in India needs to exercise caution to prevent Talibanisation of India. “Or what is happening with the minorities in Afghanistan will happen with Hindus in India,” said Surya, who started his political career as a BJYM worker in Karnataka in 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-tejasvi-surya-takes-on-sp-with-bhaijaan-swipe/articleshow/86695259.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Three abducted minors rescued, four men arrested||CHANDRAPUR: The local crime branch (LCB) rescued three adolescent girls from Pune and arrested four abductors on Friday. Two of these girls had gone missing from Warora town on Monday, while the third one had gone missing on the same day from Babulgaon village in Yavatmal district. Two girls studying in Std VIII and Std IX had gone missing from their homes on September 27 in Warora town. They had left their homes together on the pretext of going to the birthday party of their friend, but did not return home. Following a complaint lodged by their parents, Warora police registered the offence of abduction as both the girls were less than 15 years old. Police superintendent (SP) Arvind Salve asked LCB to investigate the matter. Investigation carried out by LCB police inspector Balasaheb Khade revealed that the missing girls were in contact with some youths from Ralegaon in Yavatmal. Accordingly, police teams were dispatched to Ralegaon and during the course of investigation it came to the fore that one other girl from Babulgaon village in Yavatmal had gone missing in a similar fashion on the same day. An offence in connection with the third missing girl was registered with Babulgaon police station. After it was confirmed that all three girls were kidnapped by the same gang, the LCB team traced their location in Ranjangaon in Pune district. An LCB sleuth was then dispatched to Ranjangaon and the cops there rounded up the four accused youths involved in kidnapping, with the help of Pune police. The three girls were rescued from the accused, namely Rohit Sangile (20), Subham Manekar (22), Pramod Sonavane (22) and Prashik Bhoyar (23), all residents of Ralegaon. All the accused were arrested and brought to Warora, while the rescued girls were handed over to their respective families, official sources claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/three-abducted-minors-rescued-4-men-arrested/articleshow/86691153.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh ballot pitch smacks of defeat: BJP||Lucknow: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said on Friday that Samajwadi Party questioning the EVMs clearly hints that it is set to be wiped out in 2022 assembly elections. “This is the reason why SP president Akhilesh Yadav is pitching for ballot paper. In fact, when Opposition parties including SP were in Opposition, instead of gaining the trust of the people, they were busy in looting. Their politics was to rob ballots and booths,” he said. Singh said that even before the elections, the SP leadership was making excuses for their defeat by questioning the electoral process. He said that the SP is unable to digest the all-round development which is taking place in the state under the BJP dispensation. “In frustration and despair, it is trying to divert the attention of the people of the state by raising baseless arguments,” he said. The state BJP president said that SP raising the issues of farmers, youth and traders, is “ridiculous” in itself. “The sugarcane farmers of the state have not forgotten how their future was ruined through shutting down of the sugar mills during the SP regime, how they had to wait for years and years for the payment of their crops and how they had to face police lathis at the mill gates. “On the other hand, the BJP government made a record payment of sugarcane. And the farmers are well aware of it,” he said. Likewise, the youth have not forgotten how only a particular caste got recruited in government jobs and the eligible people were forced to knock the doors of the court. He said that in the last four and a half years in the BJP government, government jobs were given to the youth in a fair, transparent manner and without any discrimination. “So is the case with traders who have not forgotten how during the SP regime the goons of SP used to extort money and the criminals used to roam freely,” he said, adding that the SP leaders were suffering under Yogi’s rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-ballot-pitch-smacks-of-defeat-bjp/articleshow/86695297.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cop tested Covid-19 positive twice, found without vaccine during ‘Operation Chaitanya’||NAGPUR: A cop from Tehsil police station tested Covid positive twice and was also the first patient in city police last year to be found without having taken any dose of the vaccine. The cop, known for his superlative detection prowess, was zeroed in the ongoing ‘Operation Chaitanya’ launched by city police chief Amitesh Kumar. The head constable, apprehensive about vaccination due to diabetes, was counselled to take the jab by the special team under Dr Sandeep Shinde, chief medical officer, Nagpur police hospital. Around seven cops from Tehsil police station were jabbed on the spot. Kumar launched ‘Operation Chaitanya’ to ensure maximum coverage for cops and on spot vaccination at their police stations or other units by the visiting medical team. Around 98% in the city police have already taken the first dose while 97% have been covered by the second dose. City police now aims to close in the gap further before the anticipated third wave. Around 32 personnel have so far died due to Covid and 2,460 tested positive in the last two waves. A special team under Dr Shinde has been formed to conduct verification at police stations to ensure that the cops left out of the vaccination drive be sent for getting jabbed at the earliest with a voluntary consent. Dr Shinde's team has already spotted around 57 cops whose second dose had been pending and were jabbed on the spot during his intervention. The testing positive of 12 cops after returning from Pune earlier this month and also of family members of a few other cops prompted Kumar to initiate the special drive to ensure the city police personnel are protected as far as possible with vaccine cover. Kumar said the concept behind launching the dedicated drive was to ensure that the cops who failed to take their pending vaccine dose or were facing other problems would be facilitated by the special medical team. “We cannot compel and hence this drive is to counsel, facilitate and administer the pending doses at the police stations itself,” he said. Dr Shinde said two registration and verification clerks have been engaged to verify the vaccine status of each cop through their Adhaar-linked mobile phone number on the Cowin-App. “We are leaving out the disinterested ones, the ones having allergies and the pregnant ones,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cop-tested-covid-positive-twice-found-without-vaccine-during-operation-chaitanya/articleshow/86691130.cms||Soumitra Bose

Channi was talking to media after meeting the Prime Minister at his official residence in New Delhi in the evening. He met PM Modi for the first time after taking oath as the Punjab CM earlier this month Calling his visit a courtesy call, Channi said it was the duty of any chief minister when he takes over to call on the Prime Minister. He said the overall outcome of the meeting was quite positive as it was held in a congenial atmosphere. He said he had apprised Modi about the preparedness of paddy procurement across the state, which was to commence from October 1 and now has been delayed due to the directive of ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution. Channi added that the Prime Minister informed him that he would soon get this issue addressed in consultation with the ministry of food on top priority. Referring to the Kartarpur corridor, which was closed due to a surge in Covid-19 cases during the past several months, Channi asked Modi to immediately reopen it as there is now considerable improvement in the pandemic situation. He said this step would go a long way in enabling the devotees to pay their obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur. Channi also impressed upon the Prime Minister to immediately find a permanent solution to the farmers’ demands on priority as it has led to overall economic slowdown in the state which is predominantly an agrarian economy. He emphasised on the need to resume the process of dialogue with the farmers immediately to repeal the three contentious central farm laws and sought the Prime Minister’s personal intervention in this regard. Seeking Centre’s support and cooperation to encourage organic farming, the chief minister also impressed upon Modi to help the state in promoting this eco-friendly farming in a big way to boost its economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-meets-pm-urges-him-to-resume-talks-with-farmers/articleshow/86693351.cms||---

The message in Hindi read ‘Nissantano ko baccha mil sakta hain’ (Childless can get a child). An alert teacher from Akola, Pallavi Kulkarni, who is also child welfare committee chairperson, came across the message a couple of days ago. The message also carried photo of the girl. Kulkarni contacted local police and also consulted deputy commissioner Biraris. The police contacted Amravati commissioner of women and child welfare, Yavatmal collector Amol Yedge and SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal and with the help of Kulkarni planned a sting operation. Kulkarni contacted the Beti Foundation, Wani, presenting herself as a decoy parent willing to adopt the infant. The woman running the foundation allegedly demanded Rs4 lakh from her. When expressed inability, the woman from the NGO agreed to reduce the “price” by Rs50,000, but insisted that the “deal” should be carried out sooner as another interested party from Nagpur is also enquiring about the girl. September 30 was finalized to complete the formalities. Accordingly, Kulkarni accompanied by Akola child welfare Raju Ladulkar, members of Yavatmal child welfare committee and police in plain clothes reached Wani and met the parents as well as the foundation office-bearers. As soon as the baby was shown to Kulkarni, she signalled the waiting cops and they took the parents, baby girl, four of the Beti Foundation office-bearers into their custody. The girl’s parents are learnt to be facing financial crisis and she was the fourth daughter born to the couple. Facing acute financial distress, the parents were convinced by the Beti Foundation head to give their daughter in “adoption”. The girl’s mother later informed the police that she was offered Rs1.51 lakh by the NGO. Wani police have registered a case under Section 370 of IPC and sections 81 and 87 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The girl has been kept in a child care home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/akola-teacher-foils-plan-to-sell-15-day-old-girl/articleshow/86691102.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Ready schools for Classes I to VIII: CEO||COIMBATORE: District chief education officer N Geetha has asked the schools to plan seating arrangements in such a way to help students maintain physical distancing norms before primary and middle schools reopen on November 1. The schools had reopened for Classes IX to XII on September 1. There weren’t any issues in accommodating the students and maintaining social distancing, as the schools were utilizing the classrooms of lower classes. When the students of Classes I to VIII return, it would be difficult to maintain social distancing among them, as there would be space crunch. “We have asked the headmasters to plan the seating arrangement for Classes I-VIII,” Geetha said. She said the schools with insufficient classrooms would have to plan the classes either in shifts or alternate days. Government schoolteachers were, meanwhile, asked to inform parents about the school reopening, as many of them in rural areas may not be aware of the same. Geetha said the students may be staying in outstations. “Hence it is important that teachers inform parents in advance to ensure the flow of students to the schools when they reopen. Parents and teachers have to take at least one dose of vaccine.” The block education officers were instructed to inspect the schools to check for preparedness at regular intervals, as the schools were closed for more than one year. The schools were asked to carry out necessary repair and cleaning work, besides keeping the toilets and classrooms neat and tidy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ready-schools-for-classes-i-to-viii-ceo/articleshow/86693328.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Cong got procurement deferred to hide its mgmt failure: SAD||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday accused the Congress government in Punjab of getting the procurement of paddy postponed by 10 days to hide its failure in making the required arrangements for procurement of the crop. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal accompanied a trolley filled with paddy to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) head office in Chandigarh to get its moisture content checked in the presence of a deputy general manager-level officer which was recorded at 12.9%, against the allowed moisture content of 17%. He claimed the 10-day postponement in paddy procurement, which was supposed to have started on October 1, was “unprecedented”. “This will spell doom for the state’s economy. Farmers had planned in advance and had started harvesting their crop in the last few days. Paddy has also reached mandis in the state,” Sukhbir claimed, adding the delay would not only result in harassment of farmers but also jeopardize the paddy crop in case of inclement weather. The Akali leader asked the Punjab government to start procurement of paddy through its agencies immediately and ensure farmers did not suffer due to any delay affected due to the central government directive. Terming the entire issue as a conspiracy hatched by the Punjab government, Sukhbir said, “The Congress has been busy in an internal fight since the last fortnight. First the leaders fought among themselves for the top post of chief minister. Then there were days of lobbying for various ministries, besides even the drama of resignation by the PCC chief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-got-procurement-deferred-to-hide-its-mgmt-failure-sad/articleshow/86693398.cms||---

Last year, only 200 people were permitted to witness the procession of elephants and cultural troupes. This year too the Vijayadashmi procession is confined to the palace owing to Covid situation. As per the suggestions of the technical advisory committee, only 500 people are permitted to witness the colourful event this year. Dasara procession is scheduled to be held at the palace on October 15. The festival will be inaugurated atop Chamundi Hills on October 7. “There is demand from tourism stakeholders to increase the seating capacity to at least 3,000, given that the positivity rate is low. CM Basavaraj Bommai will take a call on it,” Somshekar told reporters in Mysuru. Veteran politician SM Krishna, who has been selected to open the Dasara festival, will be invited on Saturday. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai himself will extend an invitation to Krishna. The government has released Rs 6 crore for the festivities. Authorities have to part with funds for Dasara celebrations at Mandya and Chamarajanagar too. The decision taken by the Dasara high power committee is final with regard to celebration. The government has decided to celebrate simple and traditional Dasara. Except for inauguration, procession and cultural/musical events on Mysuru Palace premises, the rest of the programmes have been cancelled owing to the pandemic. Though Covid cases have come down and restrictions have been eased, there is no complete relaxation.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: CSW files contempt plea against CP for sealing Ganga Jamuna||NAGPUR: A commercial sex worker (CSW) has moved the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court demanding contempt proceedings against commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar and Lakadganj police inspector Parag Thote for sealing Ganga Jamuna area and stopping prostitution activities there. While issuing notices to both respondents, a division bench comprising Justice Atul Chandurkar and Justice GA Sanap on Thursday directed them to file a reply within two weeks. The bench also told the CP to indicate the status of a representation of September 10 made by the petitioner to him in this regard. The petitioner through counsels — Raspal Singh Renu and Nihalsingh Rathod — contended that the respondents have sealed the entire red-light area citing provisions under Section 18(1) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. However, their act was in total disregard to HC’s September 10, 2015, order passed in petition No. 1185/2015. Further accusing the duo of forcibly shutting the profession of her and hundreds of CSWs in the area, the mother of two said despite being an occupier no notice was issued to her for eviction and it was a breach of an undertaking submitted to the HC in the earlier plea. Adding that the respondents failed to adhere to the due process of law by evicting her from the room and imposing curbs on her movement, the petitioner contended that it adversely affected her right to livelihood. Terming herself a “sex worker”, the petitioner said she has been in this profession since long and earning livelihood by offering her services to the consenting and desiring adults. She used to stay in a rented room in the area by paying Rs1,500 as rent and had never indulged in human trafficking, the petitioner claimed. In January this year, the respondents had issued notice to her landlady to vacate the tenants, including the petitioner under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act. The landlady had informed them that her premises was occupied by several tenants and requested for leniency. However, an order was issued by the commissioner to vacate the entire premises and to disconnect power and water connections. According to the petitioner, similar attempts were made by the then police chief to impose curbs on the CSW’s occupation in 2015. The same petitioner along with other CSWs then filed a petition in HC challenging his action. In that case, the then Lakadganj police inspector had submitted an undertaking on oath assuring that the CSWs would not be evicted from Ganga Jamuna without following due process of law. The HC had then made it clear to the respondents that the conditions in undertaking would be binding on them. However, the respondents failed to follow these conditions, the petitioner argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/csw-files-contempt-plea-against-cp-for-sealing-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/86691249.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The idea of the patrolling is to make the visibility of the police near women’s schools,colleges, children’s home, old age home, senior citizens’ house, locked houses,jewellery shops, banks and ATMs. Launching the new round-the-clock beat system by flagging off 36 vehicles for beat purpose in Trichy district, inspector general of police (IGP), central zone, V Balakrishnan said that the patrolling visibility will increase with dedicated police personnel monitoring the areas. The system, which is an initiative of the newly-appointed deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, A Saravana Sundar, will be implemented in Trichy rural, Karur, Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. Analysing the recent crimes and vulnerable areas, the Trichy range police identified 134 beats - 36 in Trichy, 51 in Pudukkottai, 20 in Karur, 9 in Perambalur and 18 in Ariyalur.

---||Lucknow||BJYM gears up for youth outreach with 200 conclaves||Lucknow: Aiming to woo the youth ahead of the high stake UP polls, the BJP will organise ‘Yuva Samvad’ campaigns in all 1,918 organisational divisions besides holding over 200 conventions across the state in December. The campaign will be launched with the help of functionaries of the Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth arm of the BJP. A detailed outline of the programme was laid out in the resolution passed by the BJYM at its state working committee meeting in Lucknow. The resolution was put forth by BJYM state general secretary, Varun Goyal, while the strategy to reach out to the youth was spelt out by BJP state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. According to sources, the morcha has also decided to hold communication programmes in all 18 commissionerates across the state. Besides, the frontal wing will also organise sporting activities in various districts to attract the youth. The morcha will also hold at least one convention between two assembly seats for the youth. The conventions are proposed to be addressed by various senior BJP functionaries including BJYM national president Tejasvi Surya. Plans are afoot to rope in Union minister Anurag Thakur, who was recently appointed by BJP as co-incharge of the party for the UP elections. The move to hold Yuva samvad conventions in all 1,918 divisions was perceived as the saffron outfit’s micro-planning to consolidate the youth cutting across caste lines, even as the ruling party gears up to take on a belligerent Opposition. Earlier in the day, Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (national president Tejasvi Surya along with a host of senior functionaries met chief minister Yogi Adityanath and discussed the morcha’s future roadmap. Mahila Morcha to organise ‘Kamal Shakti Samvad’: BJP’s Mahila Morcha will organise ‘Kamal Shakti Samvad’ campaign envisaging steps taken by the state government under Mission Shakti in 826 blocks and 27,789 at Shakti Kendra.

---||Chandigarh||Gambusia fish released in water bodies to fight dengue, malaria||Times News Network Chandigarh: The UT animal husbandry and fisheries department released Gambusia fish (mosquito killer fish) into water bodies at Nagar Van near Sukhna Lake, Chandigarh on Friday to prevent spread of malaria and dengue. Dr Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator, forest, Manish Kumar Lohan, director, department of animal husbandry and fisheries and Dr Kanwarjit Singh, joint director were present. The Gambusia fish will also be released in other stagnant water bodies in the days to come. The step was initiated in coordination with the forest department to curb mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, which are common in the ongoing season when mosquitoes breed rapidly. Manish Kumar Lohan said that that the Gambusia released in water bodies is being produced at the fish seed farm at the regulatory end of Sukhna lake. The department breeds this fish from April to September and then releases it from October onwards as per requirement. He said that the government fish seed farm, Chandigarh is the only farm which breeds the rare fish and supplies it to other departments like forest, health and to the general public free of cost. Dr Kanwarjit Singh, joint director, animal husbandry and fisheries department said that the aim is to control the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that can spread the dengue virus. Gambusia adult fish eats 100 to 300 mosquito larvae per day. This fish is very small and inedible, which makes it an excellent biological tool for mosquito control because the fish consume the larvae before they have a chance to develop into adult mosquitoes, he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gambusia-fish-released-in-water-bodies-to-fight-dengue-malaria/articleshow/86691241.cms||---

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the convict, identified as T Anand, 26, of Maravanpatti who murdered his mother T Thilagarani, 45, in 2018. In case of failing to pay the fine, the convict should undergo two years of jail term. Anand beheaded his mother on March 18, 2018 when she was waiting at Malaiyur bus stop to go to Pudukottai. The Malaiyur police arrested Anand. Thilagarani’s mother A Lakshmi was the complainant in the case. Thilagarani was the only daughter to Lakshmi. She was married to Thangarasu and the couple had five sons. Anand was her first son. In 2007, Thilagarani murdered Thangarasu by throwing a stone on his head over a family dispute. The Karambakudi police investigated the case and a court acquitted Thilagarani in the case. After acquittal, she stayed and fifth son stayed together while the rest of the sons refused to live with her. They were under the custody of their paternal grandfather in Maravanpatti. Anand used to quarrel with Thilagarani over a property issue. Anand had threatened his mother with dire consequences for killing his father and over property issues.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Congress, BJP spar over aid to drought-hit farmers||NAGPUR: A war of words has broken out between the BJP and the Congress on relief to be provided to drought-hit farmers in Marathwada, Vidarbha and other parts of the state. A day after MPCC president Nana Patole called on local BJP leaders to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for seeking central aid for the affected farmers, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, without directly referring to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, told media in the city that “when head of the state or minister goes to inspect destruction caused by natural calamity, then the administration starts working.” Endorsing him, former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders are so engrossed in the “power” that instead of immediately helping affected farmers by reviewing damage caused due to excess rains, they point out fingers at the Centre, like every time. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Patole targeted PM Modi for visiting Gujarat when it was badly hit by the cyclone Tauktae and declaring Rs1,000 crore aid, but failing to visit Konkan in Maharashtra, which too was ravaged by the same calamity. “It was clear discrimination on his part. Thereafter, our government sought help from the Centre in this regard, but failed to get any response. It is true that state BJP leaders had demanded immediate help for farmers from the Centre, but if they directly meet their top leadership in this regard, the farmers will get quick help,” he said. Countering him, Fadnavis said in case of major natural calamity in Maharashtra, the state government has to provide emergency relief based on the preliminary reports and help the distressed farmers immediately. “Leader of opposition in the legislative council Praveen Darekar and I would be on the inspection tour (to drought-affected areas) in Washim from Saturday. We will be touring many parts of Vidarbha and Marathwada to assess the situation. We will try to ensure maximum help from the government for the farmers,” he said. Claiming that all previous announcements by the MVA government during earlier such calamities remained on paper till date, Fadnavis, Southwest Nagpur MLA, said the compensation announced for the farmers of Konkan, North Maharashtra, Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha hardly reached them. Charging the MVA government of being “indifferent” when it comes to helping farmers in crisis, Mungantiwar called on ministers to take out a loan to help their community. “When BJP-Sena government was in power, we had issued a government resolution on August 29, 2019, to provide compensation to the farmers affected by such catastrophe,” he said. Patole can target US Prez Biden: FadnavisWhile refusing to comment on Patole’s claims of BJP-led NDA government helping former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh (PBS) to flee the country, Fadnavis said there was no need to react to his (Patole’s) every statement. “Patole can even flay the president of United States Joe Biden,” he said sarcastically. The MPCC chief had said in Mumbai that if Param Bir Singh is arrested, many skeletons will tumble out of the closet. “The investigating agencies suspect that PBS may have fled the country, which may have been facilitated by the Centre,” Patole had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-bjp-spar-over-aid-to-drought-hit-farmers/articleshow/86691278.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Wards 11, 96 miss out 100% vaccination status by a whisker||COIMBATORE: Had it not been for the negligible number of people unwilling to get inoculated, those with health complications and the ones who had contracted Covid-19 recently, wards 11 and 96 in the city would have achieved the milestone of 100% vaccination of the eligible population with the first dose by now. While they have missed out the 100% mark by a narrow margin, the city corporation deserves a pat on the back for inoculating 99.85% of the eligible population in ward 96 (Kurichi) and 99.63% in ward 11(Saibaba Colony) through special camps, taking full advantage of the vaccine availability. As per the data available with the city corporation, 10,774 of the 10,790 eligible population in ward 96 and 6,676 of the 6,701 eligible population in ward 96 have taken the first vaccine dose till date. While there are only 3,565 houses in ward 96, compared to 4,322 in ward 11, the former has a population of 13,340, against just 7,929 in ward 11. Interestingly, the wards also represent the people belonging to entirely different socioeconomic status - Saibaba Colony is a posh locality, where upper middle class and elite people live, while Kurichi is mostly populated with lower middle class and poor people working in organized and unorganized sectors. City health officer Dr Sathish Kumar said the special camps on Sundays had helped them inoculate the maximum number of population. He said wards such as 23 (RS Puram), 24 (RS Puram) and 98 (Sundarapuram) were likely to achieve 100% vaccination (first dose) soon. Health officials said only 16 people in ward 96 and 25 in ward 11 were yet to take the first dose of vaccine. Of them, 14 are unwilling to take the jab, another 14 are not in a position to get inoculated because of their health conditions and 13 are forced to wait as they were infected with the virus recently. Andiappan, sanitary inspector of ward 96, said there was a good response to the special vaccination drives that they had conducted. “We had conducted six rounds of special camps by roping in health workers. After that, only a few hundred people were left out two weeks ago. And they were covered in the two mobile vaccination camps. However, we could not convince four people, three of them from the same family, to get inoculated.” Chandrasekar, sanitary inspector of ward 11, said the special and mobile vaccination camps had played a major role in vaccinating the maximum number of people in his area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wards-11-96-miss-out-100-vaccination-status-by-a-whisker/articleshow/86693449.cms||V Devanathan
---||Chandigarh||In 5 Punjab districts, protesters seek compensation for cotton crop damage||Bathinda: Demanding a compensation of Rs 60,000 per acre for farmers whose cotton crop has been damaged by the outbreak of a pest named pink bollworm, farmers held protests at deputy commissioner (DC) offices in five districts of Punjab on Friday. The farmers also took out protest marches in the five districts — Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Fazilka and Faridkot. Farm outfit BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) has now decided to start an indefinite protest near the residence of Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal at Badal village from October 5. They will continue the protest till full compensation is not provided to aggrieved farmers for loss to cotton crop. Farmers also lambasted the central government for delaying paddy procurement by 10 days and demanded a review of the order. The state government has already ordered a special girdawari (revenue assessment) to assess the loss to crop by the pink bollworm outbreak. Upon finding the loss from 76% to 100%, the compensation of Rs 12,000 per acre is admissible. Farmers, however, are demanding Rs 60,000 per acre, apart from compensation of Rs 30,000 per farm for labourer families for job loss. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said they were demanding Rs 60,000 per acre as the crop had been damaged completely and six months of farmers had already gone into growing the the failed crop. He said many of them would have to pay for the land lease without growing any crop, said farmer outfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-5-punjab-districts-protesters-seek-compensation-for-cotton-crop-damage/articleshow/86693427.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||‘Punjab in safe hands’: Deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa slams ‘alarmist narrative’||CHANDIGARH: Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Friday said an “alarmist narrative” was being created by certain people, including former chief minister Amarinder Singh, about peace and security in Punjab. He warned them against such designs, saying that such a narrative would create an unnecessary sense of fear and insecurity among people. Assuring critics who have been raising concerns over the threat from Pakistan after the change of regime in the state, Randhawa, who heads the home department, made it clear that Punjab was in safe hands and, when needed, every sacrifice would be offered. During his surprise visit to the Punjab Police headquarters on Friday morning, when questioned about former chief minister Amarinder’s meeting with national security adviser (NS) Ajit Doval, Randhawa said he wished Amarinder would have shown this much concern during his stint. “There is nothing new about this threat as it existed before as well and it will continue in future also,” said Randhawa. “What has changed within less than two weeks?,” he quipped. The deputy chief minister asked whether the people raising the alarm wanted to suggest that Punjab was absolutely safe earlier and now it had turned unsafe. “And if Punjab is really in danger or trouble right now, the seeds of that trouble must have been sown much before, certainly not within a week’s time,” he said. However, at no point did he name former CM Amarinder. Randhawa said the alarmist position had been taken just for opposition and to create panic and fear among people. “Whom are you trying to help or benefit with such alarmist hue and cry?” he said, while remarking that facing the challenge was one thing, and creating panic and alarm was something else. During the inspection, the deputy CM exempted police officers and staff absent from duty, from any action for the first time, but said the motive behind the check was to give better, efficient and citizen-centric services to the people. Randhawa also assured timely promotion of all police staff, adding that the process to recruit over 10,000 police personnel was in full swing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-in-safe-hands-dy-cm-slams-alarmist-narrative/articleshow/86693469.cms||---

Police arrested a couple for buying the boy for Rs 3 lakh and a middleman who helped them. “A special team is on the lookout for six others including the baby’s mother, her parents, brother and uncle as they are on the run,” said the superintendent of police (SP) of Tuticorin district S Jayakumar. R Manikandan, 38, of Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district got married to Jebamalar, 28, of Tuticorin district in 2019. The couple lived in Virudhunagar district till they separated a few months ago due to differences. Jebamalar returned to her parents place at Kothanar Colony in Tuticorin along with their child. “Her parents tried to arrange her remarriage and found the infant was hindering the prospects of finding an alliance. So, the family decided to sell the baby,” the SP said. On September 23, Jebamalar, her brother Antony, mother Kiruba, father Selvaraj and uncle Daniel approached brokers Jesudas and Karthikeyan to sell the baby without Manikandan’s knowledge. They sold the child for Rs 3 lakh to a childless couple H Selvamani, 52 and his wife Sridevi, 40 from Kanyakumari district. Manikandan who heard that his child was sold went to Jebamalar’s house and found him missing. On September 28, he lodged a complaint with the Sipcot police to rescue his son. A special team led by an officer in the rank of an assistant superintendent of police traced the whereabouts and rescued the nine-month-old on Friday. They also arrested Selvamani and Sridevi and S Karthikeyan, 30, of Reddiyarpatti near Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district who was one of the middlemen. The trio was produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody. The baby was produced before the district child welfare committee in Tuticorin on Friday. After examining the proofs produced by the biological father, the infant was handed over to him. Nine people, including Jebamalar, her parents, relative and middlemen were booked under Section 81 (punishment for any person who sells or buys a child for any purpose) of the Juvenile Justice Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/woman-sells-baby-to-marry-again/articleshow/86693445.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Survey on to identify wards with more vax requirement||COIMBATORE: City health officer Sathish Kumar said a survey was underway to identify the number of people covered by the first dose and second dose of vaccine in each of the 100 wards in the city. “This will help us identify the areas that need more vaccine allocation and special inoculation camps and focus on such wards. Also, we could plan awareness drives in such areas, if people are hesitant to get inoculated,” the officer said. He said contract corporation workers, who were roped in for the door-to-door survey to identify people with flu-like symptoms, were tasked with the additional responsibility of collecting vaccination details of people in each ward at their doorsteps. The officer said the survey team would fill up details such as name, age, phone number and vaccination status of the residents in the forms that were provided to them. “If a minimum of 10 people from a same street are ready to get inoculated, we are ready to dispatch a mobile team to their doorsteps and vaccinate them. The team will also cover the people who have difficulty in stepping out of their houses.” A sanitary inspector, who didn’t want to be named, said some people were reluctant to share the details with the people carrying out the survey. “If they continue to remain adamant, we will intervene and collect the details. If the people are unwilling to take the jab, we will insist on a written statement from them. We cannot compel them after a point.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/survey-on-to-identify-wards-with-more-vax-requirement/articleshow/86693479.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: After 13-year wait, truck driver gets government job||NAGPUR: Thirty-year-old Ashish Mawle toiled — first as a menial labourer and then a truck driver — for 13 years before he became one of the 61 eligible candidates for getting a job in the government on compassionate grounds (anukampa) in various departments of zilla parishad (ZP). After being selected as a junior assistant clerk at panchayat samiti, Ramtek, Mawle said, “My mother used to do domestic work at people’s homes for a living. The first thing I did was to call her up and ask her to discontinue working at others’ places.” Mawle's voice choked with emotion as he expressed how he felt after much struggle and a long wait finally paved way for the coveted government job. He got the job following his father Vithhal's death on duty in the ZP. Mawle submitted an application to get the job in place of his father in 2008, after which he started making rounds of the ZP office to fulfil various formalities and push his documents around, trying to make the cut as soon as possible. With a younger sister and mother to look after, Mawle used to toil for livelihood, working as a driver or labourer when not running pillar to post for the job. “I got emotional after getting the job and so did my mother,” said Mawle, who had cleared SSC but could not continue as his father's death compelled him to assume responsibility of the family. ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar, who has so far helped 129 candidates get government jobs on compassionate grounds, said transparency was maintained in the entire process and norms were followed for allotting placements. He is assisted by a team under supervision of deputy CEO Anil Kite. “We showed every candidate the available placement opportunities and how they were being allotted jobs, following the criteria,” Kumbhejkar said. Like Mawle, 29-year-old Bhagyashree Tengre was another candidate who got employment on grounds of compassion after a wait of 10 years. The eldest of three sisters, Tengre was selected as a junior assistant clerk in ZP' s district rural development authorities. She too got the job in place of her late father. Tengre, who had to discontinue studies post HSC following her father's demise to support her family of three sisters and their mother, is contemplating resuming her education. “I want to purchase a house for us first,” said Tengre, who worked as a marketing executive and walked 10-15km per day to go from shop to shop for taking orders. 41-year-old Vilas Sahare, who got the job of junior assistant clerk at Kuhi panchayat samiti, too had been waiting for his turn since he had submitted his application in 2008. Sahare, who was a farm labourer, will not join government duty soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-13-year-wait-truck-driver-gets-government-job/articleshow/86691339.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Weaker than past two years, this monsoon ends with just 6% surplus||Panaji: The southwest monsoon experienced a normal season this year with 106% of state average rainfall. The highest rainfall this season was at the Pernem rain gauge station which recorded 41cm of cumulative rainfall from June 1 to September 30. The southwest monsoon came to a close on Thursday and figures show that July received 20% higher than normal highest rainfall. Between July 10 and 24, there was continuous intense rainfall in Goa leading to a flood-like situation towards the end of it. Despite this, there was a drastic change the following month with minus 48% deficiency of rainfall in August, which the excess rainfall in September made up for with 80% higher than normal rainfall. The state average rainfall was 6% higher than normal, the India meteorological department (IMD) said. When compared to the past two years, this season’s rainfall was lesser than the previous years — 2020 and 2019 — which were excess rainfall years. The southwest monsoon yielded 41% higher than normal rainfall in 2020 and 33% higher than normal rainfall in 2019. The withdrawal of monsoon in the north-western parts of India is usually from September 17 however this year, there is a delay in the withdrawal. This season the southwest monsoon withdrawal is expected from October 6 in the north-western India followed by other parts of the country, the IMD said. The normal date of withdrawal for Goa is October 14. The monsoon conditions are weak and wind patterns are slowly changing, as observed by the IMD. Currently, the cyclonic storm Shaheen has intensified into a severe cyclonic storm over northwest and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea. The system is moving away from the Indian coast. The wind speeds will be very high in the North Arabian Sea as a result of this weather phenomenon. Fishermen have therefore been requested to avoid venturing into the sea as a result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weaker-than-past-two-years-this-monsoon-ends-with-just-6-surplus/articleshow/86693577.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Trichy||2 from Trichy conned by cyber fraudsters||TRICHY: Cybercrime sleuths on Thursday registered two cases of online cheating of city residents by fraudsters. One of the victims, P Pradeep of Kondaiyampettai Agraharam, said he received an SMS message from a mobile number seeking his know-your-customer (KYC) particulars to renew his bank account number on July 25. An unsuspecting Pradeep shared vital information such as net banking credentials with the fraudster. He got an OTP which the fraudster asked him to enter in the link sent by him. As soon as he typed it out, a message flashed saying Rs 20,000 has been debited from his account. However, the complainant unwittingly ended up repeating it for one more time and lost another Rs 45,000. As he realised that he was cheated of Rs 65,000, he filed a complaint online and got a case registered on September 29. The second case was of a youth named M Abdul Rahman of Ariyamangalam. A diploma student at a private polytechnic college in Trichy, he received an SMS on his mobile number mentioning that an e-commerce firm was recruiting manpower for full-time and part-time jobs. Rahman fell for the bait and clicked on the link which took him to a WhatsApp account where he was asked to deposit money to make it double. According to his complaint, he deposited Rs 3,640 through a link. Thereafter, he made several payments totalling Rs 93,640 between September 27 and 28 believing that he will get his money doubled but he was taken for a ride. Cybercrime inspector R Sindhunathi who took up the investigation of both the cases said on Friday that they have launched investigations to trace the fraudsters. She also advised people not to fall prey to such false and lucrative advertisements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-from-trichy-conned-by-cyber-fraudsters/articleshow/86693455.cms||---
