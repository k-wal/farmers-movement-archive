The security review conference was chaired by General Officer Commanding (GOC) of 16 Corps Lt Gen M V Suchindra Kumar and was attended by senior police, paramilitary, army and other officers, including Additional Director General of Police Mukesh Singh, they said. The meeting at Nagrota on the outskirts of Jammu city on Friday came in the backdrop of ongoing anti-terror operation in Poonch forests in which nine Army personnel have been killed, increasing use of drones by Pakistan to ferry weapons and explosives along the Line of Control, and attacks on security establishments in the region. A Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) and four other security personnel laid down their lives in a fierce gunfight during the start of the counter-insurgency operation in Surankote forest of Poonch on October 11. Four other soldiers, including a JCO, lost their lives in another encounter in Nar Khas forest in Mendhar on October 14th evening after the security forces extended the cordon and search operation. Meanwhile, BSF's Additional Director General (ADG) of Western Command N S Jamwal on Friday reviewed the security situation at the International Border (IB). Jamwal visited sensitive border areas of Samba and Kathua and reviewed the operational preparedness of field formations at border, PRO BSF, DIG S P S Sandhu said. During his visit, he also interacted with BSF troops and appreciated the challenging operational duties being performed by them, Sandhu said. He was briefed by IG BSF Jammu Frontier D K Boora and the operational commanders with their domination plans. Jamwal instructed them to be alive to the recent situation and strengthen their border domination more vigorously. His touring of other areas of Jammu, Arnia and Akhnoor will continue for next couple of days, DIG said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-security-officials-review-security-situation-in-jk-ahead-of-shahs-visit/articleshow/87213629.cms||---

Alvaro Pulido, who is Colombian, has been indicted alongside Alex Saab on allegations they ran a network that exploited food aid destined for impoverished Venezuelans and moved $350 million into foreign accounts.  The West African island nation of Cape Verde earlier this month extradited Saab to the United States, enraging Maduro who suspended dialogue with the US-backed opposition.  The State Department said it was offering $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Pulido.  "Pulido and his co-conspirators allegedly marked-up the cost of producing the boxes of food in order to make a personal profit from their production," an announcement said.  Pulido and four others were slapped with new charges over the scheme that were unveiled Thursday by a federal grand jury in Florida.  If convicted, Pulido and the others could each face up to 100 years in prison, according to the Justice Department.  Venezuela's opposition has described Saab as a frontman doing shady dealings for Maduro, a left-wing populist whose nation has fallen into economic despair.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-offers-reward-for-another-associate-of-venezuelas-maduro/articleshow/87213812.cms||---

Amarinder was responding to a personal attack by Randhawa who gave a statement in Jalandhar on Thursday that he would ask the DGP to probe Amarinder’s link with the Pakistan-based ISI, established through his friend and Pakistani defence journalist Aroosa who used to live in his residence in Chandigarh. Since Amarinder has now said that there was a threat to Punjab and the country from the ISI, the state government would get Amarinder’s ISI link, Randhawa had said. On Friday, Raveen Thukral, media adviser to Amarinder Singh, tweeted on behalf of the former CM: “So now you’re resorting to personal attacks @Sukhjinder_INC. One month after taking over this is all you have to show to people. What happened to your tall promises on Bargari & drugs cases? Punjab is still waiting for your promised action.” “You were a minister in my cabinet @Sukhjinder_INC. Never heard you complain about Aroosa Alam. And she’d been coming for 16 years with due GoI clearances. Or are you alleging that both NDA and @INCIndia led govts in this period connived with Pak ISI?” Thukral tweeted. In a series of tweets, Thukral wrote: “As for who sponsored Aroosa’s visa, of course I did, for 16 years. And, FYI, @Sukhjinder_INC, requests for such visas are sent by Indian HC to @MEAIndia, which gets them cleared by RAW and IB before approving...” In an attempt to advise Randhawa, Amarinder said, “What I’m worried about @Sukhjinder_INC is that instead of focusing on maintain law & order at a time when terror threat is high and festivals are around the corner, you’ve put @DGPPunjabPolice on a baseless investigation at the cost of Punjab’s safety.” Randhawa hit back with a tweet: “By the way, sir @capt_amarinder why are you so perturbed over the probe on Aroosa and ISI links? Who sponsored her visa and everything concerning her will be thoroughly probed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/captain-amarinders-pak-friend-caught-in-punjab-political-crossfire/articleshow/87214065.cms||---

According to an MEA readout, the two sides “agreed to strengthen cooperation in West Asia and the Indo-Pacific, on countering terrorism and radical extremism, and addressing emerging challenges in the cyber and space domains.” Truss met finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman and environment minister Bhupendra Yadav — significant as the UK prepares to host the COP26 in Glasgow next month. However, Truss was not given a call on PM Narendra Modi, indicating that the recent spat on recognition of vaccine certifications is still a sore point with the Indian government. Truss and Jaishankar emphasised Afghan territory should not be used to “threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist attacks.” They called for unhindered access to Afghanistan for humanitarian assistance. The MEA statement said the two ministers reviewed Roadmap 2030 and took forward discussions on “enhancing cooperation in trade and investments, people-to-people relationship, health partnership, climate change, science & innovation and defence & security.” Both sides pushed the start of FTA negotiations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-uk-agree-to-strengthen-ties-on-west-asia-indo-pacific/articleshow/87214087.cms||---

And I don’t think developing countries have enough resources to waste,” UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said on Friday, responding to a question raised by TOI on India’s continued investment in coal-fired power plants. Guterres was interacting with journalists during a virtual meet organised by Covering Climate Now, an organisation of media outlets from across the world. “I am extremely worried yet hopeful. The progress by nations in recent weeks has not been enough. We are getting closer to the Conference of Parties 26 (COP26) and I hope there is still time to avoid a failure in Glasgow,” he said. This year’s COP, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow, will see the Paris Agreement on climate change being revisited for the first time. Global leaders will also need to show how they have met their declared targets. Answering TOI’s question on how a highly populated country like India can make a complete energy transition, Guterres said, “It is certain that coal is an investment that is condemned; to invest in it is a decision that is economically wrong. Countries which are hugely dependent on coal need to increase their electrical production to ensure electricity for all. For this, I appeal to the developed world to establish coalitions to support such nations and help them in accelerating their transition towards clean energy.” Referring to his interactions with the Indian leaders, Guterres recalled how they “always said Paris Agreement established a principle of common but differentiated responsibilities depending on nations’ capabilities”. He stressed that the time has now come for “emerging economies to go an extra mile”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/investing-in-coal-is-building-white-elephants-un-chief/articleshow/87214138.cms||Manka Behl

A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and J K Maheshwari said delay in raising the juvenile claim cannot be a reason to dismiss the plea and asked the state governemnt to verify their claim within a month. A bench headed by Justice Banerjee had passed a similar order in July and granted interim bail to 13 prisoners of Agra central jail who spent around 20 years in prison and were not released despite them being recently declared juvenile at the time of committing offence. The convicts had not taken the defence of juvenility due to ignorance during the trial in which they were convicted and it came to light when their ages were examined on the direction of the Allahabad high court. The high court had passed the direction in 2012 and ordered the Juvenile Justice Board to hold an inquiry for determination of the age of such prisoners who were languishing in different jails in the state who were alleged to be juvenile at the time of committing offence. The Board after holding inquiry passed orders on various dates since 2017 declaring several prisoners juveniles at the time of commiting offence and 13 of these prisoners in Agra jail were also declared juvenile. They, however, continued to languish in jail as the state government did not take any action even after the Board declared them juvenile.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-raise-defence-of-juvenility-even-after-conviction-says-supreme-court/articleshow/87214175.cms||---
---||India||Scrap Consumer Protection Act if you don’t want tribunals: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Expressing displeasure over delay in appointments in the districts and state consumer disputes redressal commission, the Supreme Court on Friday said if the government does not want the tribunals, it should abolish the Consumer Protection Act. “If the government doesn’t want tribunals then abolish the act... We are stretching our jurisdiction to see the vacancies are filled in. Normally, we shouldn’t spend time on this and the posts should be filled. Unfortunately, the judiciary is called upon to see that these posts are manned. This is not a very happy situation,” a bench comprising Justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh said. The SC was hearing a suo motu case on the government inaction in appointing president and members/staff of districts and state consumer disputes redressal commission and inadequate infrastructure across India. It directed that the process of filling up vacancies in the state consumer commissions as per its earlier directions must not be impeded by the judgment of Bombay high court which had quashed certain Consumer Protection Rules. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, appearing for the Centre, said the government is in the process of filing an appeal against the Bombay HC order. He said the Tribunal Reforms Act introduced by the Centre was not in contravention rather it was in consonance with the Madras Bar Association judgment of the apex court. The top court said, “It seems that the bench says something and you do something else and some kind of embargo is being created and in this process, the people are suffering. “These are places for remedy like consumer forums. These are small issues that people deal with and these are not high stake matters,” the bench remarked. The SC directed states to submit data in a prescribed form within one week, failing which the concerned secretary has to remain present before it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scrap-consumer-protection-act-if-you-dont-want-tribunals-supreme-court/articleshow/87214190.cms||---
---||World||US seeks to contain Beijing anger after Biden vows Taiwan defence||WASHINHGTON: The United States on Friday sought to prevent an escalation with China, saying there was no change in Taiwan policy after President Joe Biden promised to defend the island from attack by Beijing. Tensions have soared in recent months as Beijing steps up air incursions near Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy that the growing Asian power has vowed one day to take over, by force if necessary. At a CNN televised forum in Baltimore on Thursday evening, Biden was asked whether the United States would come to Taiwan's defence if China invaded. "Yes," he responded. "We have a commitment to that." Biden's statement appeared at odds with the long-held US policy of "strategic ambiguity", where Washington helps build Taiwan's defences but does not explicitly promise to come to the island's help in the event of war. The White House clarified Friday that it was still guided by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, in which Congress required the United States to provide weaponry to "enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defence capabilities". "The president was not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy," a White House spokesperson said. "We will uphold our commitment under the act to support Taiwan's self-defence, and we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes in the status quo," the spokesperson said. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin, on a visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels, declined to discuss "hypotheticals" but said the United States "will continue to help Taiwan with the sorts of capabilities that it needs to defend itself". The policy is designed to deter a Chinese invasion but also discourage Taiwan from formally declaring independence -- something Beijing regards as a red line. Biden's comments were welcomed on Friday by Taiwan, which has pushed to bolster international alliances to protect itself from Beijing. "The US government has demonstrated, through actual actions, their rock solid support for Taiwan," Presidential Office spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement. But Beijing said that Biden's comments risked "damaging Sino-US relations," warning Washington on Friday to "act and speak cautiously on the Taiwan issue." "China has no room for compromise on issues involving its core interests," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing. The US should not underestimate China's "staunch determination, firm will and strong ability" to defend against what it sees as threats to its sovereignty, Wang added. Biden made a similar pledge in August during an interview with ABC, insisting that the US would always defend key allies, naming Taiwan among them, despite the withdrawal from Afghanistan in the face of the victorious Taliban. Biden's remarks were unlikely to be out of ignorance. The veteran politician himself was serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1979 and voted to approve the Taiwan Relations Act. Richard McGregor, a senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, said Biden may have wanted to show greater firmness. "I suspect Biden was not trying to announce any change. So it was either loose language, or perhaps a slightly harder tone, deliberately adopted because of the way Beijing has increased the tempo of its military harassment of Taiwan recently," he told AFP. China has ramped up economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who views Taiwan as already sovereign and not part of "one China." Military pressure has escalated in the last year with China sending waves of fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers into Taiwan's air defense zone. According to an AFP tally, more than 800 flights have been made into the zone since September last year -- 170 just this month. Defending Taiwan, one of Asia's most progressive democracies, has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington's otherwise deeply polarised landscape. At Thursday's live town hall, Biden was also asked by an audience member whether the United States would be able to keep up with China's rapid military development. Biden responded with "Yes." "Don't worry about whether... they're going to be more powerful," he said. "China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in the history of the world." Biden's comments come in the wake of a Financial Times report that China has tested a state-of-the-art hypersonic missile with nuclear capacity that flew around the planet before landing, albeit not on target.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-seeks-to-contain-beijing-anger-after-biden-vows-taiwan-defence/articleshow/87194690.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court notice to ex-Twitter India MD on UP government plea||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear the Uttar Pradesh government’s plea against the Karnataka High Court order, quashing notice of personal appearance issued by the state police to the then Twitter India managing director Manish Maheshwari in relation to the circulation of an allegedly offensive video on the microblogging platform. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana issued notice to Maheshwari after solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, submitted that there was a question of law that needed to be examined and settled by the court. The notice was issued in connection with a probe into the uploading of a communally sensitive video by a user on Twitter. In August, Maheshwari was transferred to the US as a senior director of the company. The UP government filed appeal in the top court challenging the July 23 HC order, which had quashed the notice as mala fide. The Ghaziabad police had issued notice to Maheshwari, asking him to appear at Loni Police Station for questioning in relation to the investigation connected with the viral video of the assault on an elderly Muslim man. The Karnataka HC on June 24 granted protection to Maheshwari in an FIR lodged by the Loni Police in Ghaziabad. The matter is connected with the circulation of a video in which Abdul Shamad Saifi, had alleged that he was beaten by some young men who forced him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ on June 5. But, the police said, Saifi had not made any such allegations in his FIR lodged on June 7. The police claimed that the video was shared to incite communal discontent had booked Twitter Inc and some journalists and politicians for sharing the video.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-notice-to-ex-twitter-india-md-on-up-government-plea/articleshow/87214251.cms||---
---||World||Biden, Macron discuss European defence, will meet in Rome: White House||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Friday discussed security cooperation in Africa, Europe and the Indo-Pacific, as the two countries work to mend fences after a rift over a US security pact with Britain and Australia.  Biden and Macron plan to continue their discussions when they meet this month in Rome at a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies, the White House said.  Vice President Kamala Harris also will meet with Macron during a visit to Paris in November, the White House said, underscoring efforts to repair ties between the United States and France after Australia scrapped a French submarine contract in favour of a pact with Washington and London last month.  The visits follow a trip by US secretary of state Antony Blinken to Paris earlier this month, where he said he had "very positive, very productive" conversations with French leaders. The US Trade Representative Katherine Tai also met with her French counterpart, Franck Riester, on Friday, on the sidelines of a Group of Seven trade minister conference, where she stressed the US commitment to "strengthening the bilateral relationship with France", her office said in a statement.  In his call with Macron, Biden reviewed ongoing efforts by both countries to support stability and security in the Sahel region and to enhance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, as well as efforts to enable a stronger European defence, the White House said.  "President Biden looks forward to the meeting with President Macron in Rome later this month, where they will continue the conversation, take stock of the many areas of US-France cooperation, and reinforce our shared interests and common values as we take on challenges and opportunities together," it said.  Harris will meet with Macron while in Paris to deliver a speech at the fourth annual Paris Peace Forum on November 11 and participate in the Paris Conference on Libya on Nov. 12, her spokesperson Symone Sanders said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-macron-discuss-european-defence-will-meet-in-rome-white-house/articleshow/87214252.cms||---
---||India||IAS officers have no right to claim cadre of choice: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday said a candidate cannot claim allocation of cadre of his/her choice as a matter of right after qualifying civil services examination as he/she opts for serving anywhere in the country with “eyes wide open”. A bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian passed the order while adjudicating a 14-year legal battle of an IAS officer to get Kerala cadre as it was her home state. The Kerala high court had passed the order in favour of A Shainamol and directed the Centre in 2017 to change her cadre from Himachal Pradesh to Kerala. The SC, however, quashed the HC order and said that issue of allocation of cadres was well settled by the apex court in various judgments and the consistent view of the Court has been that even if the name of the candidate appears in the merit list, such candidate has no right to claim appointment. “In the light of Rajiv Yadav (case), the allocation of cadre is not a matter of right. It was held that a selected candidate has a right to be considered for appointment to the IAS but he has no such right to be allocated to a cadre of his choice or to his home state. As stated above, allotment of cadre is an incidence of service. The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country. The state has no discretion of allocation of a cadre at its whims and fancies. Therefore, the Tribunal or the HC should have refrained from interfering with the allocation of cadres on argument of alleged violation of the allocation circular,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ias-officers-have-no-right-to-claim-cadre-of-choice-supreme-court/articleshow/87214278.cms||---

But that is not true,” said Thackeray, speaking virtually at the inauguration of the first wildlife DNA testing lab in Nagpur and three fast-track DNA testing units under the Nirbhaya scheme to test human DNA samples in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur forensic labs. Thackeray said he is proud of Maharashtra and Mumbai police for their efforts at keeping the drug menace in check. “A few days ago, Mumbai police caught heroin worth Rs 25 crore, but because there was no heroine involved in it, no one spoke about it. No one knows the names of those policemen. We should felicitate them,” Thackeray said. He said the Maharashtra police is a strong, competent force, and strict action is taken against anyone who violates the law, without any leniency shown. “Attempts are being made to tarnish this image of the Maharashtra police, and we have to stop these attempts,” said Thackeray. The NCB has arrested several people, including actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan, in a drug bust case. Meanwhile, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil said the state government is likely to table the final draft of the Shakti Act which prescribes stringent punishment for crimes against women and children in the upcoming winter session of the legislature in December.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-seized-heroin-but-no-one-spoke-as-there-was-no-heroine-uddhav-thackeray/articleshow/87214321.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Goa||ISL: Kerala Blasters' aim is to be the hardest team to beat, says sporting director Karolis||Panaji:Kerala Blasters FC haven’t had the most encouraging start to the season. Plans to send some players to train abroad had to be shelved due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and when it was time for Kerala Blasters’ pre-season, they were forced to train at home, instead of Europe. “When we have such a long break between seasons like in India, sometimes you need to think out of the box and try to find all the best possible solutions,” Kerala Blasters sporting director Karolis Skinkys told TOI. “The plan was that some players would go to Europe just after the season and continue to play football. It got delayed, delayed and delayed (due to the pandemic). Then of course we had plans to take the whole team abroad.” Instead, Kerala assembled in Kochi early August and kickstarted their preseason under new coach Ivan Vukomanovic. When it came to the first competition of the season, there were big expectations. Kerala’s participation in the Durand Cup with a strong team raised hopes of the club winning its first trophy, but ended with another disappointment as the club made a group-stage exit. “Yes, I am disappointed by our performance. But is it important, in my opinion, no. I must say it was a mistake to participate in the Durand Cup. It's not a competition for the first team. It's mainly for the reserve team in best case. “If Durand wants to have (top) teams in the future, they should approach and organise everything in much, much better level. Because looking from our pre-season perspective, it was little a bit disappointing and time waste,” said Karolis. Kerala have since put the Durand disappointment behind them and started the second phase of pre-season in Goa. Players are regaining their fitness, foreign players – all of whom are new to the club – are leading by example and the mood ahead of next month’s Indian Super League (ISL) is encouraging. Expectations though are being kept under check. “Our target is to win and not allow anyone beat us easily in the next game,” said Karolis. “We start from basics which we were not able to do last year. Maybe we talk too much. Now is the time to be well organised and work very hard in each game. If you ask me about targets, it’s to be the hardest team to beat in the next game.” Kerala Blasters will face ATK Mohun Bagan in the opening match of this season’s ISL on November 19. The club made it to the final twice in the first three years, but haven’t come anywhere close in the last four years, disappointing a huge army of fans. Last season, Kerala finished among the bottom two, winning just three of their 20 league matches. The expectations at the start of the season were high, but the team simply didn’t measure up to the challenge. “There is nobody to blame personally. Basically, the circumstances were against us. If someone needs to be blamed, let it be me, because we could not prepare properly,” said Karolis. Wiser from last years’ experience, his first in India, Karolis’ hand can be seen all over the team this season. He personally selected the coach from hundreds of applications and “at least one long conversation with 37 coaches.” Not to forget, there is a complete new set of foreign players, all of whom were “eager to join.” “After four seasons (of failure), it's natural that you have to make changes. Each case (of foreign player not being retained) is different, but overall, we thought we will be able to find players who fit more,” said Karolis, who made heads turn with the capture of Spanish striker Alvaro Vazquez and Uruguayan midfielder Adrian Luna. As for the Serbian coach, Karolis was never really in doubt. “We were looking for a coach who needs to prove something. It’s important to have ambitious persons in the team. Ivan is an ambitious coach; he’s coming here to prove and to teach as much as possible. I have no doubt about that. “Ivan is a players’ coach. The players will follow him and won’t have doubts. He will hep the team to be well organised which was not the case with Kerala last (few) years. He has worked in many countries and his knowledge is unquestionable. When we looked at all the coaches, he was the one who gave us the biggest trust,” said Karolis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/isl-kerala-blasters-aim-is-to-be-the-hardest-team-to-beat-says-sporting-director-karolis/articleshow/87214194.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

It’s probably been the longest ever that college students across the city could not attend physical lectures. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, city campuses were closed and now, with the Maharashtra government having announced the re-opening of degree colleges from October 20, that’s changed. While colleges are yet to start in-person lectures, vaccinated degree college students share how they can't wait to go back... ‘Classroom ka mazaa hi alag hai'Priyanka Kashyap, SYBCom student, Malini Kishor Sanghvi College Of Commerce and Economics, Juhu, says, "I'm thrilled to meet my college group. Whenever we begin, the discussion is sure to be about college memories and how things have been in the lockdown, how tough it was, etc. I’m also looking forward to going for a walk on Juhu beach with my friends. Milna hai, purani yaadein vaapas laani hai, vahin class, vahin bench sab pehley jaisa. Classroom ka mazaa hi alag hai." Dr Zuleika Homavazir, professor, management studies, Wilson College, informs, "In-person practicals for IT and science have started in batches and for others, in person-lectures may resume post Diwali. We will be ensuring that all safety norms are met. Parents are keen for students to get back to college and outstation students are also keen to come back, but we haven't opened the hostels yet." Some voice a note of concern. Shai Divan, FYBMM student, Jai Hind College of Commerce and Economics, says, “It was nice to get a survey form to ask if we had our vaccinations, if we were comfortable coming to college, the transport we would be using and if we wanted an online-offline mix of learning. I am waiting to get back to college as I missed my friends and studying in class, but at the same time there’s also some worry as we’re around our grandparents a lot as well as younger siblings who are not yet vaccinated.” For final-year students, it's a chance to savour the last of college lifeSanitising and temperature checks at the entrance are a mustWhile there is buzz that the colleges may look at reopening in phases, students are excited to go back to campus. Kiara Coutinho, final-year Arts student, St. Xavier's College, says, "We are yet to start classes in person, the degree college tests are going on online. Post that, it will be time for the Diwali break and only after that, will the college take a call and tell us. For us, we are hopeful to get to back to the campus, especially for those of us in the third year as we want to get our last chance to interact with everyone there. There's a better connect to studies and our professors if we are present at college." Niyati Trivedi, TYBA student, KES Shroff College of Arts and Commerce, Kandivali, adds, “Thinking of my friends and the campus again is such good feeling. At home, we missed bonding as a group and studying together etc. I thought I was going to miss out on all three years of my college life, but at least now I can savour some of that. We haven’t got any official notice to start yet, but if we do go back, we will stick to wearing our masks.” TYBA student Amaia Tahilramani, adds, "We haven't begun physical classes yet and may start after Diwali. I'm quite excited, it's going to be great to go back. The college has told us informally that there will be several measures and from my side, I'll be carrying sanitiser and will be double masking." ‘Will follow all regulations stated by Mumbai University’Classrooms have to sanitised regularlyAdherence to the new safety mandates will be a must. The SOPs are out and refer to strictly following the mask and social distancing rule, sanitisation measures and canteens to be closed on premises, among other things. Colleges will have to ensure that these are adhered to. Prof. V N Rajasekharan Pillai, Provost Somaiya Vidyavihar, informs, “We are slowly opening the campus for staff and students who have taken both the vaccine shots. All students and staff will have to wear a mask at all times. College authorities have taken every measure possible to ensure social distancing and maintaining hygiene around the campus. Combined instructional modules of physical and online teaching will be followed. Cafeterias or canteens and stalls outside or within colleges shall remain closed along with any shops on campus such as for stationery items. We will follow all the regulations stated by Mumbai University (MU) and regular sanitisation of common surfaces and office spaces will be done.” Students could get a new set of activities as well. Mahesh Savale, Assistant Professor, Sheila Raheja School of Business Management and Research, says, “We are planning restrictions on cultural activities, but there are lots of activities that can take place like literary arts — drawing and painting, creative writing, elocution or photography — where distance is permissible. So far, all our lectures were online, and now we are positive to create a campus that is student-friendly as far as health and hygiene goes. The government SOPs are a must if we have to move towards more normalcy and if all colleges follow it, there’s a chance CIVID may not hit any stakeholders — students, faculty, management, etc.” ‘The classroom experience just cannot be replicated’A few faculty members reveal how it’s been a challenging time to teach from home. Professor Amrin Moger, Gurunanak College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Sion, says, “The decision has come in very late, but it is a very welcome move as teaching online was not easy — we were trying to swim without learning how to do, so we had to adapt a lot,” she laughs, adding, “I think it’s been more challenging for the students as they had data issues etc, so a digital divide had come in where privileged students were managing better and the lesser fortunate were finding it harder. Reopening colleges is a welcome decision as education should have been the priority along with other things — if private offices can open, then why not schools and colleges? Schools, in fact, opened before colleges did. We are really looking forward to reopening. I head the Mass Media department, and you can gauge how tough it was to teach reporting on a video lecture. The feeling of a classroom cannot be replicated. You can have a hybrid mode, yes, maybe it’s the future of education, but classroom teaching and a one-to-one reaction, the actual presence of a teacher in front of you is going to remain.” ‘Many students haven’t taken the second jab, so hybrid learning will go on at the same time’Dr Anju Kapoor, Principal, Usha Pravin Gandhi of Arts, Science and Commerce, Vile Parle reveals they had done a trial run and are now set for full throttle opening. She says, “We have been welcoming vaccinated first-year students on a trial basis for a fortnight, so that they get used to it, just to get them to get familiar with the premises. The college is regularly sanitised and we are well prepared. Also, the University has laid down guidelines, so 50 per cent will only be called on a certain day. Within two weeks we will be going in for Diwali break, too. And in any case, there are no second and third year students on campus now as that semester is already over online, so we will not have that much of an exodus.” MU has asked colleges to offer a combined instructional module of both physical and online teaching for students and Dr Kapoor shares how this hybrid form of learning will have to continue. “In our college, we don’t have junior college, but for other colleges, some parents are not able to send their kids as a lot of students are below 18. The degree college instruction has come later on and many students have said that due to the gap of the dosage, they have not been given the second jab yet, so the University has made it clear that we have to run the programme in a hybrid mode, i.e. online and offline teaching. Some students have messaged me to say they will turn 18 in the first week of December. They haven’t even taken the first jab. In that case, it is difficult to go back to the pre-pandemic normal. Having said that, we look forward to having our students back.” SOPs to be followedBMC has issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with regard to Covid-appropriate behaviour for colleges as they reopen for fully vaccinated students from October 20. Here’s what to expect:• As per a report, only fully vaccinated students can come back to campus for offline classes (for students who are below 18, this rule will not apply). Students can also opt to continue with online classes. • Staggered timings for entry and exit of students. • Wearing masks at all times and installation of the Arogya Setu app on their phones. • Everyone must maintain social distancing — students to be seated in classrooms leaving alternate benches vacant and if needed, colleges may have batches for the lectures/instructions. • As per the SOP, the first bench in the classrooms must be moved back to allow for at least a 6-8 feet gap between the lecturer and the front bench students. • Cultural activities, contact sports to be avoided. • Students/staff who are residing in containment zones, should not be allowed to attend colleges and only asymptomatic staff, students, visitors to be allowed entry. • Cafeterias, canteens and shops outside and within the campus premises remain closed. • Vaccination certificates of all the staff, faculty, students and other associated personnel must be submitted to the principal’s office for record-keeping. Did you know?Mumbai University has a total of 837 affiliated colleges in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Palghar, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. BLURBAs per a report, three SOPs have been issued — one for college authorities and students, second for college staff and third, for steps to be taken by college authorities on noticing COVID symptoms/positive cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sanitisation-staggered-class-timings-no-canteen-what-mumbais-college-students-can-expect-as-they-head-back-to-campus/articleshow/87211727.cms||Ismat Tahseen

Parties are being hosted throughout the whole month – with some even combining pre-Diwali and Karwa Chauth parties. Those working behind the scenes say this year, the festival is quite a contrast from last year. ‘We had Karwa Chauth bookings requests from July-August’One of the most crucial elements of these parties is bridal photoshoots as women dress up for the festival in traditional outfits. Dipak, a wedding photographer, says, “We have been fully booked for these parties at five-star hotels, and we have been getting bookings from July for Karwa Chauth. It is not just for Karwa Chauth, we have bookings for even before and after the festival. Since these get-togethers were not organised last year, this year these parties are being organised on a big scale.” Grand scale private celebrations across NCRThe day before Karwa Chauth, some people are organising mehendi parties to get together with their girl gang. Usha Sharma, a boutique owner, says, “Last year, I had very few orders for this festival. I have at least 12 bookings from my clients across NCR. Earlier I would get one order (per client) for Karwa Chauth, but this year on average, there are four to five orders from many clients.”  In 2019, many ladies from B-Town came together for a grand Karwa Chauth partySeema Nanda, a beautician, shares, “There is a massive jump in bookings from the last year. Karwa Chauth is celebrated with great zeal across NCR, and we are always fully booked for the week around the festival. But last year due to COVID, most families did not celebrate on a grand scale. This year, many are fully vaccinated and hence this year, the festival actually feels like a celebration. We have advance bookings not just for the Karwa Chauth week, but for the next week, too.” Most hotels from Pitampura and Dwarka to Greater Noida have been booked for Karwa Chauth parties for the whole week. Combined Karwa Chauth and pre-Diwali partiesSudha Mittal, who works in the organic farming sector, will be hosting one such party. She says, “This year, I have multiple Karwa Chauth party invites from my friends, relatives and colleagues. All these festivals are so special this year because after being through so much amid the pandemic, we are all coming together to celebrate. A lot of my friends are combining pre-Diwali and Karwa Chauth parties as people get busy shopping during the festive season and are unable to attend multiple parties.” Anamika Rathore, a homemaker, adds, “The festive spirit is back this year. We have been organising exhibitions before Karwa Chauth and receiving a great response. We have a lot of friends in our group who lost someone in the family, so they are not celebrating the festivals. That’s why rather than organising it on the day when everyone wants to be with family, we are organising some parties later, too.” Read AlsoMehendiwallas across NCR: Our work has gone down by 40-50% during the pandemicAhead of Karwa Chauth, mehendiwallas across NCR talk about dwindling work in pandemic times.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bollywood-style-karwa-chauth-parties-return-to-ncr-this-year/articleshow/87213809.cms||Niharika Lal

It was a small affair with only limited people in attendance and the invite also mentioned, “This invitation is extended on the understanding that you are fully vaccinated.” With a slight nip in the air and wine glasses clinking, Delhi’s social circle was seen talking about COVID protocols at airports, their next holiday plans, and how they felt “alive” to once again be in a room full of people. Friends were seen catching up and everyone at the party shared the sentiment that they had missed human interaction amid the lockdown. Birthday traditions continue for BhaichandBefore cutting the cake, Bhaichand shared with the gathering that he could not invite a lot of people because of COVID restrictions. “These are people from my inner circle.” Then he invited Mark Tully and Aruna Vasudev to come forward to cut the cake with him. He added, “Every year, Mark, Aruna and I, the three of us, cut the cake together. We all have birthdays around the same time.” He later told us, “I have been in Delhi since 2000, but before that I was here for my studies and then with the UN for eight years so I accumulated friends.

Out of the eight deceased, seven were from the same family. The eighth was their neighbour. Three others have been injured. Speaking to TOI, Jasveer Singh, station house officer of Badli in Jhajjar, said, “The accident took place at 3.30am. The driver had stopped the car behind a stationary truck on one side of the road to take a break. A truck, whose driver probably couldn’t see the car, hit it from behind.”  He added that on the basis of a complaint received from the relatives of the family, an FIR has been registered under IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death due to negligence) and others against the truck driver, who is absconding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/7-of-a-family-neighbour-killed-as-truck-rams-into-car/articleshow/87214395.cms||Deepak Lavania

This war and India’s victory are special as it was not fought to gain some land or expand. The intention behind entering that was humanity and protection of democracy. The politico-military synergy led to our success,” Singh said. Stating that the congruence of India’s politico-military thought and actions led to the birth of Bangladesh, he termed the 14-day war a glorious chapter of India’s military history, which saw the largest surrender in the world after the second world war, with more than 93,000 Pakistani soldiers coming forward and giving up their weapons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/efforts-on-for-further-integration-of-armed-forces-says-rajnath/articleshow/87214507.cms||---
---||World||Giuliani associate convicted of campaign finance crimes||NEW YORK: A New York jury convicted a former associate of Rudy Giuliani on Friday of charges that he made illegal campaign contributions to influence the United States politicians and advance his business interests.  The verdict was returned in Manhattan federal court, where Lev Parnas was on trial for more than two weeks as prosecutors accused him of using other people's money to pose as a powerful political broker and cozy up to some of the nation's star Republican political figures.  One part of the case alleged that Parnas and an associate made illegal donations through a corporate entity to Republican political committees in 2018, including a $325,000 donation to America First Action, a super PAC supporting former president Donald Trump.  Another part said he used the wealth of a Russian financier, Andrey Muraviev, to make donations to US politicians, ostensibly in support of an effort to launch a legal, recreational marijuana business.  Parnas, 49, was convicted on all counts.  The Soviet-born Florida businessman had insisted through his lawyer that he never used the Russian's money for political donations. He briefly closed his eyes and shook his head as the verdict was read.  Outside the courtroom after the verdict, Parnas said, "I've never hid from nobody. I've always stood to tell the truth."  A co-defendant, Ukraine-born investor Andrey Kukushkin, was convicted of being part of the effort to use Muraviev's money for political contributions. He had also denied any wrongdoing.  The case had drawn interest because of the deep involvement of Parnas and a former co-defendant, Igor Fruman, in Giuliani's efforts to get Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden's son during his campaign for president.  Giuliani remains under criminal investigation as authorities decide whether his interactions with Ukraine officials required him to register as a foreign agent, but he wasn't alleged to have been involved in illegal campaign contributions and wasn't part of the New York trial.  The case did, though, give an up-close look at how Parnas entered Republican circles in 2018 with a pattern of campaign donations big enough to get him meetings with the party's stars.  "In order to gain influence with American politicians and candidates, they illegally funneled foreign money into the 2018 midterm elections with an eye toward making huge profits in the cannabis business," US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement following the verdict. "Campaign finance laws are designed to protect the integrity of our free and fair elections - unencumbered by foreign interests or influence - and safeguarding those laws is essential to preserving the freedoms that Americans hold sacred."  In addition to the $325,000 donation to America First Action, made through an energy company, prosecutors said Parnas and Fruman orchestrated donations to U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, of Texas, and to other committees supporting House Republicans.  Giuliani and Trump were sparsely mentioned during the trial, although a photograph featuring Parnas with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, was one of the first exhibits shown to jurors during closing arguments and a video of Giuliani with Parnas was among exhibits jurors could view during deliberations.  DeSantis was among those who received campaign contributions that prosecutors said were traced to $1 million that Parnas and Fruman received from Muraviev, who has been involved in several U.S. cannabis ventures.  About $100,000 of Muraviev's money went toward campaign contributions in what Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten called a conspiracy to secretly bring his "wealth and corruption into American politics" in violation of laws barring foreign donations to U.S. political candidates.  "The voters would never know whose money was pouring into our elections," Scotten said.  Former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, now a candidate for U.S. Senate, testified during the trial that a blustering Parnas suggested he could raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for him in 2018. He eventually came through only with a $10,000 check that Laxalt's lawyers told him to reject.  Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, had called the allegations against his client "absurd."  He insisted in his closing argument that Muraviev's money went toward supporting legal marijuana businesses looking to expand.  Kukushkin's lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, sought to portray his client as an unknowing dupe in the scheme, who was mocked behind his back by other participants as mentally challenged.  Following the verdict, prosecutors asked for immediate incarceration of Parnas and Kukushkin, citing a risk of flight, but the judge allowed them to remain free on bail while awaiting sentencing.  Fruman pleaded guilty earlier this year to a single count of solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national. He awaits sentencing.  Another co-defendant, David Correia, also pleaded guilty and has been sentenced to a year in prison for crimes, including defrauding investors in an insurance company that had paid Giuliani a $500,000 consulting fee.  Parnas awaits a second trial in connection with that scheme.  Giuliani has insisted that he knew nothing about potentially illegal campaign contributions by either Parnas or Fruman. The former mayor says everything he did in Ukraine was done on Trump's behalf and there is no reason he would have had to register as a foreign agent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/giuliani-associate-convicted-of-campaign-finance-crimes/articleshow/87214631.cms||---
---||India||Don’t let guard down in festive season, warns PM Modi||NEW DELHI: India's success in administering 100 crore doses of anti-Covid vaccines has generated a strong sense of optimism in all sections with experts upbeat about India's economy even as it was necessary to remember that having a strong "kavach (armour)" did not mean that people should let down their guard, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. In an address to the nation, the Prime Minister said there is a feeling of "enthusiasm and joy (utsah aur umang)" with experts predicting a vigorous economic recovery and Indian companies receiving investments that will generate jobs. "If we see any section, whether society or economy, optimism, optimism, optimism is to be seen," he said. He said the 100 crore vaccinations answered all doubts about India's capacity to combat the coronavirus, but emphasised the need for continued caution ahead of the festive season and said wearing masks must be second nature. "It is like we are used to wearing footwear when we step out… we should also get used to wearing masks," he said. Read Also100 crore shots in the arm: India's milestone in Covid vaccinationIndia achieved a major milestone in its battle against Covid-19 as cumulative vaccinations in the country crossed the 100 crore mark on Thursday. After China, which has administered more than 200 crore doses, India is only the second country to have reached the landmark of 100 crore jabs.The call for continued Covid safe practices is significant given upticks in infection even in countries like the UK where vaccine coverage has reached a majority of the population. "No matter how good the cover is, no matter how modern the armour is, even if the armour is a complete guarantee of protection, weapons are not thrown while the battle is on. I request that we have to celebrate our festivals with utmost care," Modi said. While pointing to the progress of India's vaccination programme launched on January 16 this year, Modi said "The 100 crore vaccinations are not just a figure, but a reflection of the strength of the country, it is the creation of a new chapter of history. This is a picture of a new India that sets difficult goals and knows how to achieve them." The "positive" note in the Prime Minister's address, along with the call for care and caution, seemed to mark an effort to put behind the ravages of the second wave that hit India in April-June this year, and which had seen crises in oxygen supplies and hospital beds in many cities along with a high number of fatalities. Modi took a few moments to refer to criticism of his call in 2020 for people to clang metal plates, saying it had been said that how would this help fight the pandemic. "This was meant to be a sign of unity and resolve… India's vaccination programme has been based and driven by science," he said, rebutting some experts, in India and abroad, who had argued that the pandemic cannot be countered by such demonstrative actions. "But for us democracy means ‘sabka saath’. Taking everyone along, the country started the campaign of ‘free-vaccine, vaccine for everyone’. Poor-rich, village-city, faraway, the country has only one mantra that if the disease does not discriminate, then there cannot be any discrimination in the vaccine. So it was ensured that VIP culture does not dominate the vaccination campaign," the Prime Minister said, underlining the fact that the people irrespective of their stature were asked to wait for their turn and doses were administered accordingly. Modi said when the pandemic struck, questions started arising about India, if the country will be able to fight this global pandemic and from where will India get the money to buy so many vaccines from other countries. "There were more questions like when will India get the vaccine? Will the people of India get the vaccine or not? Will India be able to vaccinate enough people to stop the pandemic from spreading?" the PM said and continued, "There were various questions, but the 100 crore vaccine doses answer every question. Today many people are comparing India's vaccination programme with developed countries of the world. The speed with which India crossed the 100-crore mark is also being appreciated." The achievement will make everyone view India as more safe from Covid, Modi said, pointing out that it is often missed that the other prominent countries of the world had decades of expertise in researching vaccines and India mostly depended on vaccines made by these countries. "However, India’s entire vaccination programme is born in the womb of science, has grown on scientific grounds and has reached all four directions through scientific methods. It is a matter of pride for all of us," he said. The PM once again exhorted people to encourage the "Made in India" campaign. "I will tell you again that we should insist on buying every little thing which is made in India, which an Indian sweats hard to make. And this will be possible only with the efforts of everyone," the PM said. Modi also exuded confidence about the Indian economy saying that experts and many agencies from home and abroad are very positive about India's economy. "Today not only is record investment coming in Indian companies but new employment opportunities are also being created for youth. With record investment in startups, unicorns are being made," the PM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-guard-down-in-festive-season-warns-pm-modi/articleshow/87214533.cms||Akhilesh Singh

---||World||39 yrs after wife's disappearance, millionaire real estate scion Robert Durst charged with her murder||NEW YORK: Days after he was sentenced to life in prison in California for killing a confidante who helped him cover up the slaying of his first wife, Kathie Durst, millionaire real estate scion Robert Durst has been charged with murder in her death, nearly four decades after she disappeared, officials said on Friday.  Authorities in the New York City suburbs confirmed Friday that they have charged Robert, 78, who, as per his lawyers, has been hospitalised on a ventilator in Los Angeles after testing positive for the Covid-19.  A state police investigator filed a criminal complaint Tuesday in a town court in Lewisboro, New York, charging Robert with second-degree murder in the death of Kathie who vanished in 1982. He had not been previously charged in Kathie's disappearance.  The case garnered renewed public interest after HBO aired a documentary in 2015, in which the eccentric heir appeared to admit killing people, stepping off camera and muttering to himself on a live microphone: "Killed them all, of course."  The complaint charging Robert wasn't announced at the time by law enforcement officials or Westchester District Attorney Mimi Rocah who recently convened a grand jury as she seeks to indict him for the killing. The grand jury continues to meet and hear witnesses and could eventually return an indictment.  "The Westchester County District Attorney's Office can confirm that a complaint charging Robert Durst with the murder of Kathleen Durst was filed in Lewisboro Town Court on October 19, 2021. We have no further comment at this time," Rocah's office said in a statement Friday.  Robert Abrams, a lawyer for Kathie Durst's family, said in a statement: "Robert Durst has now been formally charged with the murder of Kathleen McCormack Durst. We are very happy with this development. At this time, however, we will not be making any further comments until the grand jury process is completed."  Messages seeking comment were left with Robert's lawyers.  The one-page felony complaint filed in Lewisboro cites evidence in the files of the Westchester district attorney, the New York State Police and the Los Angeles district attorney, as well as "conversations with numerous witnesses and observations of defendants, recorded interviews and observations of Mr. Durst's recorded interviews and court testimony in related proceedings".  Kathie Durst was 29 and in her final months of medical school when she was last seen. She and Robert Durst, who was 38 at the time, had been married nearly nine years and were living in South Salem, a community in Lewisboro. Her body was never found. At the request of her family, she was declared legally dead in 2017.  The complaint charging Robert Durst bears the name of state police Investigator Joseph Becerra, who reopened the probe in 1999 after receiving a tip about Kathie Durst's disappearance. Authorities searched a lake and the couple's home but turned up little evidence, with Becerra equating the search to a "a needle in a haystack."  Becerra testified in July at Robert Durst's California trial that he wanted to interview Robert Durst's friend, Susan Berman, but never got the chance because Durst shot and killed her in 2000. Los Angeles prosecutors said Robert Durst killed Berman because she was preparing to confess to police how she helped him cover up Kathie Durst's death.  The criminal complaint filed Tuesday against Robert Durst was done parallel to the grand jury proceedings, which could continue for several more weeks. Such filings are often seen as a first step in the criminal process because, in New York, all felony cases require a grand jury indictment to proceed to trial unless a defendant waives that requirement.  After Berman's death, Durst went into hiding, disguising himself as a mute woman living in a cheap apartment in Galveston, Texas. There, he killed a neighbor and chopped up his body, but was later acquitted after telling the jury he did it in self-defense.  Durst was also sentenced in 2016 to over seven years in prison after pleading guilty to a federal weapons charge stemming from a 2015 arrest in New Orleans.  Durst's family owns more than 16 million square feet of real estate in New York and Philadelphia, including a 10% stake in One World Trade Center, the Manhattan skyscraper formerly known as the Freedom Tower. Family members bought out Robert Durst's stake in the business for $65 million in 2006.  In the 2015 HBO documentary "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst," Durst appeared to admit killing people and admitted he made up details about what happened the night she disappeared because he was "hoping that would just make everything go away." Robert, who has numerous medical issues, sat in a wheelchair for much of the California trial and sentencing hearing. He read his lawyer's questions from a tablet giving live transcriptions because he struggles with hearing.  Robert, testifying in the Los Angeles trial in August, denied killing Kathie. After her medical school called to report that she hadn't been going to class, he said he figured she was "out someplace having fun" and suggested that perhaps drug use was to blame.  "It hadn't occurred to me that anything had happened to her," Robert said, speaking slowly in a strained, raspy voice. "It was more like: What had Kathie done to Kathie?"||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/millionaire-real-estate-scion-robert-durst-charged-with-1982-murder-of-wife/articleshow/87214766.cms||---

Though India is not against ‘net zero’ goal per se, the country will not commit to the 2050 timeline. It will strongly underline its demand for the developed world sticking to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and the need to deliver on climate change mitigation finance. It is, however, learnt that India may make some additional commitments or announcements, factoring in its overachievement of 2030 pledges and ambitious renewable energy goals of 450 GW, and align it with the 2047 timeline, coinciding it with 100 years of independence. The Union cabinet will next week approve India's formal stand at the upcoming 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26) which is to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US President Joe Biden, Australian PM Scott Morrison and other world leaders in person in the first week of November. "You cannot expect every country to go for ‘net zero’ goal by 2050 for the world to hit carbon neutrality by mid-century," said an official, privy to inter-ministerial consultations on India’s position ahead of COP26. He argued that few countries who emitted substantially in the past 150 years must go for a ‘net negative emission’ goal before 2050 to limit the global average temperature rise within 1.5 degree celsius – a red line whose breach would be extremely disastrous for the world. This position had got traction when ministers of both India and China along with 23 other nations as part of ‘like-minded developing countries’ (LMDC) group unanimously agreed to take a common stand at COP26. The LMDC is a climate negotiation group of 25 developing countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. During an informal briefing on COP26 which is to be held in Glasgow, UK from October 31 to November 12, officials in the environment ministry on Friday said a 15-member negotiation team from India, led by environment minister Bhupender Yadav, would participate in the UN climate meet which would try to finalise rules for Article 6 (carbon markets) of the Paris Agreement and discuss different aspects of 'loss and damage' (concept of compensating poor and vulnerable countries hit by natural disasters). Though the rule-book for the Paris Agreement was finalised in 2018, the countries could not reach a consensus on Article 6 mechanism – the only left over part of the climate deal. "Our consistent stand on finance and transfer of technology at affordable cost will remain on the table," said an official. Meanwhile, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) on Thursday gave its approval to the political declaration – called ‘One Sun’ - for the launch of the ambitious Green Grid Initiative-One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) at COP26. The OSOWOG is a trans-national grid that will be laid all over the globe to transport solar power to different countries. TOI had last week reported that Modi and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will, in the presence of global leaders, formally launch the initiative. Modi will travel to the UK on October 31. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend leaders’ summit in person during November 1-2 at COP26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-wont-commit-to-net-zero-goal-at-cop26/articleshow/87214703.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Authorities said 12 trekkers have been confirmed dead. Kapkot (Bageshwar) subdivisional magistrate Paritosh Verma told TOI that the operation to recover the bodies had to be halted due to bad weather. “We will bring the bodies back on Saturday,” he said. The dead trekkers include a woman from New Delhi and nine people from West Bengal. The identities of two trekkers or where they are from has still not been established. Uttarakhand rains live updates Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer of Uttarkashi, said the bodies found on Thursday have been brought to Harsil while rescue teams are still trying to retrieve the other bodies. Read AlsoHotels empty out in worst-hit Nainital, tourist bookings nosedive in MussoorieVed Sah, secretary of Nainital Hotels’ Association, told TOI that 90% of the bookings for the next two months have been cancelled. “Tourists are scared to come after the casualties that have been reported in rain-related incidents,” Sah said.Some of the dead climbers have been identified as Tanmay Tiwari (30), Vikas Makal (33), Saurav Ghosh (34), Saviyan Das (28) — all from West Bengal — and Anita Rawat (38), a resident of Hari Nagar in Delhi. “Two group members are still missing,” said Patwal, adding that search operations will continue on Saturday. In other parts of Uttarakhand stranded trekkers had to be rescued via choppers. In Bageshwar, 61 trekkers, including six US nationals, were airlifted from Pindari, Kafni and Sunderdhunga glaciers. Over 100 tourists stuck in Darma and Byas valleys in Pithoragarh are also being airlifted, said authorities. Nainital continues to remain the worst-affected district with 35 confirmed deaths. In Cham- pawat, 11 people have been killed while six people have lost their lives in Almora.

---||India||Covid-19 has cut life expectancy by two years in India: IIPS study||MUMBAI: Life expectancy in India has dropped by roughly two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a statistical analysis by scientists from the International Institute for Population Studies in the city. “Life expectancy at birth for men and women has declined from 69.5 years and 72 years in 2019 to 67.5 years and 69.8 years respectively in 2020,” said IIPS assistant professor Surayakant Yadav, whose work was published in the prestigious journal ‘BMC Public Health’ on Thursday. ‘Life expectancy at birth’ refers to the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of his/her birth remain constant in the future. The new study also looked at ‘length of life inequality’ (the variation in length of life within populations), and found the Covid toll on men in the 35-69 age group was the highest. “The 35–79 age group had excess deaths caused by Covid in 2020 compared to normal years and it is this group that has contributed immensely to the drop,” said the author. Coronavirus in India live updatesThe IIPS study was conducted to look at the burden repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic on mortality patterns in the country. Across the world, Covid-19 has resulted in excess deaths in comparison to the previous years. According to the union health ministry, 4.5 lakh people died due to Covid-19 since March 2020, but data specialists have worked out that millions have died due to the pandemic in India. Read AlsoIndia registers 16,326 new Covid cases, active cases decline to 1,73,728India reported a single-day rise of 16,326 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 3,41,59,56. The death toll has climbed to 4,53,708 with 666 daily fatalities, according to the data updated at 8 am on Saturday. While the active cases have declined to 1,73,728, the lowest in 233 days.The IIPS study used data collated by the 145-nation Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study as well as CovidIndia Application Programming Interface (API) portal for the analysis. The study found that India was right in the middle as far as the impact on mortality is concerned – as compared to India’s 2-year drop, life expectancy at birth dropped more than one year in the US, England and Wales and 2.28 years in Spain. “The Covid impact has wiped out the progress we made in the last decade to increase the life expectancy figure,” said Yadav. India’s life expectancy at birth now is the same as it was in 2010. “It will take us years to catch up,” he added. However, IIPS director Dr K S James said many epidemics have in the past had an impact on life expectancy at birth figures. “It is a dynamic figure that keeps changing every year. In Africa, life expectancy dropped drastically due to the HIVAIDS epidemic, but recouped in a few years,” said James. An expert, who didn’t want to be named, said a drop of two years is high if one considers the central health ministry’s Covid toll figures. “If the case fatality rate was higher at 3 or more as suggested by individual statisticians, only then does the drop seem fine,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-has-cut-life-expectancy-by-2-years-in-india-iips-study/articleshow/87214864.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||India||Pandemic property boom: Beachside Maharashtra village house goes for Rs 80 crore||MUMBAI: Across the Mumbai harbour, the pandemic and the resultant lockdown have led to a property boom in the sleepy coastal town of Alibaug. In probably the biggest deal in the town, a 6-acre beachfront home has been sold for Rs 80 crore in Awas village of Alibaug. The sprawling property, owned by a Parsi business family, the Engineers of Atash Leasing, has been purchased by Shrikantadevi Damani, wife of Radhakishan Damani, stock market investor and founder of the supermarket chain DMart.Last April, Radhakishan and his brother Gopikishan purchased a bungalow on Narayan Dabholkar Road in south Mumbai for a record Rs 1,001 crore. On Friday, the Atash family patriarch, Cyrus Engineer, did not respond when contacted by TOI. Property documents show the deal was registered on Thursday. “It is an old style house built in the early 1980s much before coastal regulation zone laws were enforced. The land is filled with fruit trees,’’ local sources said. The Damanis are heavily invested in Alibaug. In 2015, Radhakishan Damani bought the five-star Radisson Blu Resort & Spa for Rs 135 crore. The Damanis, according to locals, also own a large farmhouse spread over 20 acres in Jirad village. Two months ago, actors Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh purchased a house in Mapgaon village for Rs 22 crore, sources said. They added that the land rush accelerated when around 150 families from Mumbai shifted to their weekend homes after the lockdown.  “During the lockdown, social media was flooded with posts of families walking in large gardens, jogging on the beach or swimming. Others who saw it wanted the same lifestyle,’’ they said. The roll-onroll-off ferry service which began recently between the city and Mandwa too added to the demand. It takes an hour to travel in air-conditioned comfort. Land prices are up 50% since last year. The swish set with homes in Alibaug includes Shah Rukh Khan, Ratan Tata, Noel Tata, Shapoor Mistry, Nikhil and Elina Meswani, and the Godrej family.

---||World||Supreme Court doesn't block Texas abortion law, sets hearing||WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court is allowing the Texas law that bans most abortions to remain in place, but has agreed to hear arguments in the case in early November.  The justices said Friday they will decide whether the Justice Department and abortion providers can sue in federal court over a law that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said was "enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas".  Answering that question will help determine whether the law should be blocked while legal challenges continue. The court is moving at an unusually fast pace that suggests it plans to make a decision quickly. Arguments are set for November 1.  The court's action leaves in place for the time being a law that clinics say has led to an 80 per cent reduction in abortions in the nation's second-largest state.  The justices said in their order that they were deferring action on a request from the Justice Department to put the law on hold. Sotomayor wrote that she would have blocked the law now.  "The promise of future adjudication offers cold comfort, however, for Texas women seeking abortion care, they are entitled to relief now," Sotomayor wrote.  Sotomayor was the only justice to make her views clear, but it seems there were not five votes on the nine-member court to immediately block the law Friday. It takes just four justices to decide to hear a case.  The court first declined to block the law in September, in response to an emergency filing by the abortion providers. The vote was 5-4 vote, with the three appointees of former president Donald Trump joining two other conservatives in the majority. Chief Justice John Roberts joined Sotomayor and the other two liberal justices in voting to keep the law on hold while the legal fight goes on in lower courts.  Now, though, the justices, in a rare move, have decided to weigh in before lower courts definitively decide the issues.  Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokeswoman for Texas Right to Life, said she was happy the law remains in effect. "This is a great development for the Pro-life movement because the law will continue to save an estimated 100 babies per day, and because the justices will actually discuss whether these lawsuits are valid in the first place," Schwartz said in a statement.  Amy Hagstrom Miller, the chief executive of Whole Woman's Health, said Friday's order means patients will continue to be denied care at the four Whole Woman's Health clinics in Texas, on top of the hundreds who already have been turned away.  "The legal limbo is excruciating for both patients and our clinic staff," Miller said in a statement.  The law has been in effect since September, aside from a district court-ordered pause that lasted just 48 hours, and bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant.  That's well before the Supreme Court's major abortion decisions allow states to prohibit abortion, although the court has agreed to hear an appeal from Mississippi asking it to overrule those decisions, in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  But the Texas law was written to evade early federal court review by putting enforcement of it into the hands of private citizens, rather than state officials.  The focus of the high court arguments will not be on the abortion ban, but whether the Justice Department and the providers can sue and obtain a court order that effectively prevents the law from being enforced, the Supreme Court said in its brief order.  If the law stays in effect, "no decision of this Court is safe. States need not comply with, or even challenge, precedents with which they disagree. They may simply outlaw the exercise of whatever rights they disfavor," the Biden administration wrote in a brief filed earlier in the day.  Other state-enforced bans on abortion before the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, around 24 weeks, have been blocked by courts because they conflict with Supreme Court precedents.  "Texas should not obtain a different result simply by pairing its unconstitutional law with an unprecedented enforcement scheme designed to evade the traditional mechanisms for judicial review," the administration wrote.  A day earlier, the state urged the court to leave the law in place, saying the federal government lacked the authority to file its lawsuit challenging the Texas ban.  The Justice Department filed suit over the law after the Supreme Court rejected the earlier effort by abortion providers to put the measure on hold temporarily.  In early October, US District Judge Robert Pitman ruled for the administration, putting the law on hold and allowing abortions to resume.  Two days later, a three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals put the law back into effect.  The court already is hearing arguments on December 1 in the Mississippi case in which that state is calling for the court to overrule the Roe and Casey decisions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-doesnt-block-texas-abortion-law-sets-hearing/articleshow/87215119.cms||---

The independent Congressional Research Service (CRS), in a report this week, said although the US, Russia and China possess the most advanced hypersonic weapons programmes, a number of other countries, including Australia, India, France, Germany and Japan, are also developing hypersonic weapons technology. While Australia has collaborated with the United States , India has collaborated with Russia on this, the CRS said in its report. India has collaborated with Russia on the development of BrahMos II, a Mach 7 hypersonic cruise missile, it said. “Reportedly, India is also developing an indigenous, dual-capable hypersonic cruise missile as part of its Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle programme and successfully tested a Mach 6 scramjet in June 2019 and September 2020,” the CRS said. India operates approximately 12 hypersonic wind tunnels and is capable of testing speeds of up to Mach 13, said the Congressional report which is prepared by independent subject area experts for members of the US Congress. Earlier, The Financial Times reported that China has tested hypersonic missiles. However, China denied it, saying it tested a hypersonic “vehicle” and not a nuclear-capable hypersonic“missile”. According to CRS, since 2007, the US has collaborated with Australia on the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) programme to develop hypersonic technologies. The most recent HIFiRE test, conducted in July 2017, explored the flight dynamics of a Mach 8 hypersonic glide vehicle, while previous tests explored scramjet engine technologies, it said. Like India, France has also collaborated and contracted with Russia on the development of hypersonic technology. Japan is developing the Hypersonic Cruise Missile and the Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile, it said. According to the CRS, unlike programmes in China and Russia, the US hypersonic weapons are to be conventionally armed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-building-hypersonic-missiles-us-report/articleshow/87215166.cms||---

That’s what Hindutva is all about, neither left nor centre,” he said at the launch of RSS member Ram Madhav’s book, ‘The Hindutva Paradigm: Integral humanism and the quest for the non-western world’. Hosabale said, “I’m from RSS and we have never said in our discourse in the Sangh training camps that we are rightist. In fact, many of our ideas are like leftist ideas.” He said there is space for ideas of both sides — the left and the right — since these are “human experience” and these ideas will never perish and may guide the world. “There’s no full stop in Indian tradition, calling it left or right is suitable for present day geopolitics. Geographical or political divides are the east and the west that have blurred, dimmed and melted in the post liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation,” Hosabale added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindutva-is-neither-left-nor-centre-rss-general-secretary/articleshow/87215193.cms||---

The meeting, convened in Haridwar on Thursday, was chaired by ABAP vice-president Devendra Singh Shastri of Nirmal akhara who announced the names of Mahant Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani akhara as president and Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi akhara as general secretary. The move has effectively split the 13-member akhara parishad into two groups. The first group comprises seven akharas — Nirmohi, Nirvani, Digamber, Mahanirvani, Atal, Bada Udasin and Nirmal. The other group has six akharas — Niranjani, Juna, Avahan, Anand,Agni and Naya Udasin. Baba Hathyogi of the Digamber Ani akhara, which is part of first group of dissidents, alleged that they decided to elect the office bearers on their own since they were “under-represented in ABAP body and often neglected in elections.” He said the seers of most of the seven akharas were “particularly unhappy with the speculations doing the rounds that Mahant Ravindra Puri of Niranjani akhara would be made ABAP president”. Besides, he said, the seers of the group of seven akharas also wanted Mahant Hari Giri, the incumbent ABAP general secretary, to be replaced. Mahant Hari Giri termed the announcement of the office bearers “unconstitutional and not valid under any circumstances”. As per ABAP tradition, if a president dies mid-tenure, his successor can be chosen only from his own akhara. Meanwhile, Ravindra Puri, who has been touted as a strong contender for the post of parishad president, said polls to parishad will be held as scheduled at Prayagraj on October 25.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apex-body-of-seers-splits-before-key-meet/articleshow/87215226.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||World||US targeting Feb 2022 to launch new lunar mission Artemis||WASHINGTON: NASA said Friday it is now targeting February 2022 for the uncrewed lunar mission Artemis 1, the first step in America's plan to return humans to the Moon later this decade. The space agency had initially wanted to launch the test flight by the end of this year, with astronauts on the ground by 2024 on Artemis 3, but the timeline has slipped back. It achieved a major milestone Wednesday when it stacked the Orion crew capsule atop its Space Launch System megarocket, which now stands 322 feet (98 m) tall inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After further tests, it will be wheeled out to the launch pad for a final test known as the "wet dress rehearsal" in January, with the first window for launch opening in February, officials told reporters on a call. "The February launch period opens on the 12th and our last opportunity in February is on the 27th," said Mike Sarafin, Artemis 1 mission manager. The next windows are in March and then April. These potential launch periods are dependent on orbital mechanics and the relative position of the Earth with respect to its natural satellite. The mission duration is expected to be four to six weeks. It will also deploy a number of small satellites, known as CubeSats, to perform experiments and technology demonstrations. Although likely to be pushed back, Artemis 2 is technically scheduled for 2023 and Artemis 3 for 2024, humanity's return to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. NASA says the moonwalkers will include the first woman and first person of colour to make the trip. The space agency is seeking to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon, and use the lessons it learns to plan a crewed trip to Mars in the 2030s.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-targeting-feb-2022-to-launch-new-lunar-mission-artemis/articleshow/87215198.cms||---

In an affidavit filed before the Delhi high court, the Centre said being a foreign commercial entity, WhatsApp cannot challenge the constitutionality of an Indian law, adding that the company doesn’t have a place of business in India and is engaged in the business of propagating information created by its users. “Constitutionality of a provision of law cannot be challenged by a foreign commercial entity on the ground of it being violative of Article 19 rights. The said rights are only available to citizens,” the affidavit submitted. Defending the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 and its proviso allowing traceability of the originator of a message, the government said it is meant to help law enforcement prevent offences. Citing earlier Supreme Court rulings, the government said it is duty bound to take all steps necessary to identify persons who create and circulate electronic information on sexual crimes. The government also questioned the claim of WhatsApp that traceability will lead to breaking the end-to-end encryption feature of the platform, saying there is technology available with the company to trace the sender or the creator of a message without intercepting other users. It further raised concerns over WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, saying that it allows sharing of information with Facebook, which “can be used for profiling” of citizens. “Under its mandatory privacy policy, personal data of the users would be shared with Facebook, which can be used for profiling. Such profiling is also feasible on political and religious views and can be used for any activity which can harm the security of the nation, its sovereignty and integrity besides affecting individual privacy,” it added. The Facebook-owned WhatsApp in its plea said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits “at risk”. It has urged the high court to declare Rule 4(2) of the Intermediary Rules as unconstitutional, ultra vires to the IT Act and illegal and sought that no criminal liability be imposed on it for any alleged non-compliance with Rule 4(2) which requires to enable the identification of the first originator of information. The messaging platform has made the Centre, through the ministry of electronics and information technology, a party to the petition, and argued that the traceability clause inserted in the Rules is unconstitutional and against the fundamental right to privacy, besides having the potential to target activists and journalists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foreign-entity-whatsapp-cannot-challenge-indian-laws-govt-to-hc/articleshow/87215262.cms||Abhinav Garg

They recommended speedy strengthening of the armed forces in these domains and said jointness of all wings of the armed forces in operations has also become imperative, while working with friendly countries for geospatial awareness will be important. They spoke at the inaugural of a three-day conclave celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1971 Indo-Pak war victory at the Air Force station-Yelahanka here. Rawat, while reiterating the need for theatre commands and jointness in the functioning of the armed forces for India to handle growing strategic threats from two-and-a-half fronts, said impetus must also be given to new domains of cyber and space. Reiterating China’s strength in traditional warfare domains, Kumar said the northern adversary’s capabilities in cyber and space domains has also grown exponentially in the last decade. He said AI, robotics, information warfare, all new technologies have a disruptive effect on any country and will disturb existing policies and doctrines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cyber-space-enabled-grey-zone-warfare-major-challenges-rawat/articleshow/87215356.cms||---

Earlier this year, the firm had signed an MoU with SatSure AG, a WEF Global Innovator that provides decision intelligence by leveraging advances in satellites, machine learning and Big Data analytics. SatSure operates from St Gallen (Switzerland), Bengaluru, Liverpool (UK) and Sydney (Australia).The MoU is to help Bellatrix to place its payloads in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The satellites will host a novel on-board processor for in-orbit high-resolution data processing using SatSure’s proprietary deep learning algorithms and ultra low-bandwidth data transmission on a microsatellite platform comprising Bellatrix Aerospace’s unique hybrid propulsion systems.Novel Thrusters & Space TaxiAs reported by TOI earlier, Bellatrix, in May this year, tested the country’s first privately built Hall Thruster, while it had earlier developed the world’s first commercial Microwave Plasma Thruster, which used water as fuel, and for which the company had bagged an order from Isro.Bellatrix CEO and CTO Rohan M Ganapthy, had told TOI that the firm has been working on this technology in stealth mode for four years. “The Heaterless Cathode Technology is the key innovation that sets us apart from the competition by increasing life and redundancy and life of the system. We are also the first ones in the country to have designed it to operate efficiently at very low current levels,” Ganapathy had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/with-eye-on-global-market-bellatrix-inks-pact-with-lt/articleshow/87215357.cms||---

The reason: Hindi is not taught as a subject in state government schools from classes 1 to 5. Confirming the plight of primary school Hindi teachers, Karnataka State Government Primary School Hindi Teachers Association said many of them have been languishing for 15-20 years at their places of appointment, where they are also likely to retire. In a letter to primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh, the association has now demanded that primary school Hindi teachers be permitted to seek posting as general Kannada teachers wherever available during the transfer season. The association office-bearers told TOI they were initially recruited as assistant teachers for what were then primary and middle schools and taught Hindi in classes 6 and 7. “But we are now in an ironic situation. Because of the change in the cadre and recruitment rules in 2007, we were considered Hindi teachers in primary schools. But Hindi is not taught as a subject in classes 1 to 5 in Karnataka,” the association has said in its letter. Due to this, students have been deprived of an opportunity to learn Hindi under the three-language formula adopted by the state government though there are 4,000 Hindi teachers in Hindi schools, the letter further read. The association has pointed out that the teachers have been unable to get a transfer as there are no vacancies across the state since such a post does not exist. “We have been teaching other subjects as we have completed PU, DEd (diploma in teaching) and TCH (teacher certificate in higher). But we have not had transfers in the past 15-20 years. Some of us are retiring in the same place where we were recruited,” said Rama Murthy K, general secretary of the association. These teachers have also cleared the state-level language exams for Hindi that makes them eligible for teaching the subject. “Should we be in lower primary school (classes 1 to 5) or higher primary school (classes 6 and 7)? The government is not clear. In lower primary school, there is no subject. In higher primary school, they are recruiting only graduate primary teachers. The question is where do we work?” lamented a teacher. “We are currently teaching other subjects like environmental science in lower classes. Given the depressing situation, our immediate concern is getting a transfer,” said Rama Murthy. According to the association, they have been raising this issue with the department for past few years, but to no avail. “While we are assigned to teach Hindi, we are not getting a chance to do so. At least a change of the post to other subjects will give us an opportunity with transfer. Else, the state should look at introducing Hindi as a subject on the lines of the three-language policy of the National Education Policy,” said a teacher.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/4k-primary-school-hindi-tutorsteach-everything-but-language/articleshow/87215359.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: No room for fear, says dad who fought robbers to save daughter’s jewellery||BENGALURU: A father who fought gun-wielding robbers last year when they broke into his house and took away all his daughter’s wedding jewellery has hope today of getting back the valuables. BN Srihari Prasad, a middle-aged techie, had thrown stones and punched one of the robbers who had threatened him, pointing a pistol. The good news is that Prasad, 52, may get back the gold and diamonds as the burglars have been arrested. Prasad recounted the early hours of October 4, 2020. “I was not scared, there was no room for fear in my mind at that moment as they were getting away with what I had been saving for my daughter’s future,” he said. Prasad, who is separated from his wife and lived with his father in Arekere near Mico Layout area, had been buying jewellery for his daughter since 2012. “I was angry, I chose to fight. I snatched a bag from them even as they started driving away in the car. The bag only contained a few silver articles stolen from my house,” he said. According to Prasad, the cumulative value of the jewellery at the time of purchase was around Rs 10 lakh. He threw stones at the robbers, although there was a risk that he might be shot at. This incident was captured on CCTV cameras. The two key accused in the case, 35-year-old Shammu alias Basheer and 33-year-old Syed Asifulla alias Diesel Asif, somehow escaped the police dragnet. What turned the spotlight back on them was the courage Prasad displayed while attempting to stop them. “I was at my sister’s residence in Banashankari that night when a neighbour called me around 5am and told me that some miscreants had broken into my house,” Prasad said. “I took my sister’s scooter and rushed to my house. I reached within minutes and found somebody inside. I tried to scream and alert the neighbourhood about the thieves but, by then, two of the miscreants came out and threatened me with dire consequences,” he said. He said he “swung into action, picked up a stone and threw it at them”. “I damaged their car glass while trying to stop them and even punched one of them,” Prasad recounted. Prasad filed a complaint with Puttenahalli police, who caught one gang member a few weeks after the break-in. However, Shammu and Asifulla changed residences and sim cards and avoided detection for a year. The police team solved 18 burglary cases reported in Banaswadi, KG Halli, JC Nagar and Puttenahalli along with Kolar and Belagavi districts after the arrests. Stolen valuables worth Rs 65 lakh, including 1.2kg of gold, were seized from them. Prasad said: “I had been buying gold since 2012 for my daughter. I hope to get them back soon. I appreciate the city police’s effort of nabbing the accused and helping the victims.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-room-for-fear-says-dad-who-fought-robbers-to-save-daughters-jewellery/articleshow/87215364.cms||Santosh Kumar

According to the school management, accused Deepti L, 32, of Yelahanka New Town, pocketed the cash paid by parents towards their wards’ fees. The school is on Kogilu Main Road, Marutinagar and the complaint was filed by Chikkannachari DS, its administrative officer. He told police the incident came to light when some parents contacted the management asking why they weren’t given receipts even after making full payment.  Yelahanka police registered an FIR against Deepti under IPC sections 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). In his complaint, Chikkannachari said Deepti had joined the institution in 2017 as a clerk. “She worked as a clerk and cashier and was given the responsibility of collecting fees from parents. On September 6, we contacted a parent, asking for the pending fees. To our surprise, the parent said they had paid it to accused Deepti long ago but no receipt was given. We contacted other parents, whose kids’ fees were pending as per school records. We discovered that all of them had paid the fees between January and September this year but hadn’t received receipts,” he said. The school questioned Deepti over the same and she confessed to having deposited the fee money into her personal bank account. “... Later, Deepti promised to repay the amount and sought a week’s time. However, she never paid. She stopped coming to work and her mobile is switched off,” the complainant said. Police said that they visited the suspect’s house and found it locked. Her mobile phone is switched off.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/school-clerk-siphons-off-1-7l/articleshow/87215362.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Duo hid drugs in soap boxes and books, couriered them to buyers||BENGALURU: Two persons were arrested by Central Crime Branch (CCB) police on Friday for allegedly collecting and delivering narcotics for a drug-peddling syndicate operating from New Delhi. The accused are Ravi, 28, and Ravidas, 30, both residents of a paying guest accommodation in Bellandur. According to police, Ravi was at large since last month after a drug-peddling case was registered against him in Whitefield police station. Cops were collecting information about him and learnt that he stayed in a PG with one of his associates.  A police team headed by inspectors BS Ashok and Deepak R rushed to the PG and arrested the duo. Police seized 300 MDMA pills, 100 LSD paper blots, 350 grams of charas and 1.5kg of hydroganja, all worth Rs 60 lakh, apart from gift boxes, packing covers, T-shirts and bags in the name of delivery and courier services firms from their room. Preliminary investigation revealed the accused duo was hired by a main drug peddler settled in New Delhi. The peddler used to pay Rs 50,000 each per month to the duo, who had to collect narcotics from mules or postal/ courier services and send them to his customers using delivery and courier firms. The accused hid the drugs in soap boxes, photos frames, greeting cards and books. Later, they packed them in boxes to make them look like gifts and sent them to customers in Bengaluru. Police said the syndicate based in New Delhi used to procure narcotics from foreign countries and local peddlers in India using darknet. Payment was made through cryptocurrency. The main peddlers used to collect money from customers using various mobile apps. A case has been registered against in Bellandur and CCB police have taken it up for further investigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/duo-hid-drugs-in-soap-boxes-and-books-couriered-them-to-buyers/articleshow/87215367.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Two kidney swaps save four lives at Bengaluru hospital||BENGALURU: Four patients who needed kidney transplants after almost two years on dialysis have found hope in two kidney-swap transplants in a single week in the same hospital in Bengaluru. All four families had willing donors and all the donors were women. Of the two swaps, one was between a Hindu and a Muslim family. Syeda Ayesha, a resident of Bengaluru, wanted to donate her kidney to her husband Syed Irfan Ullah but could not because her kidney was incompatible. But help did arrive. Another patient, Mahendra (name changed) from Tumakuru, too, needed a transplant. His wife wanted to donate her kidney but faced the same problem as Ayesha. Fortunately, doctors at BGS Gleneagles Global Hospital here realised that if the women swapped donors, the two transplants could be done. Ayesha said she never had a problem accepting Mahendra’s wife’s kidney for her husband. “Humanity comes above all. Religion comes only after humanity. We faced no issues in taking the decision,” she said. Irfan Ullah was on dialysis for a year and a half. For the teacher of Arabic, a transplant was his only option. On the other side, Mahendra, too, was on dialysis for two years. Given the severe demand-and-supply mismatch in kidney donations, the swap was a lifeline for Mahendra and Irfan Ullah. Ayesha’s kidney was harvested on September 7 for the transplant. At the same hospital, there was another such swap. Siddaraj Patil, a 29-year-old farmer from Yadgir, who was suffering from a chronic kidney disorder from 2019, got a lease of life because of another swap-transplant. Patil’s mother Kamala Devi was the donor but her organ was incompatible with her son. Her kidney, however, matched with the requirements of patient Satyanarayana, 39, from Andhra Pradesh. Satyanarayana’s sister Lakshmakka’s kidney matched Patil’s. The swap-transplant was done on September 14, again at BGS Gleneagles Global Hospital. All the surgeries were led by Dr Anil Kumar BT, senior consultant, nephrologist and transplant physician, along with a urology team led by Dr Narendra S, who is a senior consultant and the chief transplant surgeon. Dr Kumar said a kidney transplant is the best form of renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease but there is a huge demand-and-supply gap. “The waitlist for kidney transplantation is increasing every passing year,” he said. The doctor said that paired kidney exchanges (PKE) or swap transplantation was an innovative process where recipients get better compatible kidneys from willing donors of other patients’ families.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/two-kidney-swaps-save-four-lives-at-bluru-hosp/articleshow/87215371.cms||Sunitha Rao R

He added the allegations/complaints against the police personnel have also been investigated. However, senior advocate Prof Ravivarma Kumar, who appeared for the petitioners, claimed at least 10 complaints have been filed against police and none of them has been investigated in the manner known to law, by way of registering FIRs, despite there being a positive direction by the court in related proceedings.A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi adjourned the hearing to next month to enable the government to submit an affidavit, containing the gist of compliance vis-a-vis various orders passed by the court.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Panel to develop ‘Super 30’ engineering colleges||BENGALURU: A committee comprising academicians, industry leaders and officials among others will be formed to develop ‘Super 30’ engineering colleges in the state by taking up one institution in each district. It will be headed by Prof Karisiddappa, vice-chancellor, VTU. The decision was taken during a preliminary meeting chaired by higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan on Friday. Narayan said the purpose of the committee is to focus on providing quality teaching in every district and meet industry requirements. “Wherever government engineering colleges exist, they will be considered on priority, and in districts with no government college, private engineering colleges will be selected,” he said, adding that colleges already well known for quality education will not be included. “But those which lack quality teaching will be taken up to be developed as model colleges. The development would mainly concentrate on faculty training, industry collaborations, setting up of laboratories and foreign collaborations rather than physical infrastructure,” he said. The minister said to begin with, one department in each selected college will be taken up for upgradation and later, the initiative will be expanded to the entire institution. Narayan said the funds needed for this will be shared in the following ratio — 1/3rd will come from companies’ CSR funds, 1/3rd from VTU and 1/3rd from the institution itself. The selected colleges will be connected with leading industries and the latter will be allowed to guide the colleges. It was also suggested to rope in alumni.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/panel-to-develop-super-30-engg-colleges/articleshow/87215374.cms||---

For the second time this season, Avani, who turned 15 two weeks ago, had the measure of the seasoned pros on the circuit en route to the title in the 11th leg of the Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour.The teen sensation, who won her first pro event as an amateur in Mumbai this February and had a couple of runner-up finishes thereafter, held her nerves under pressure on the closing holes to score a one-shot victory over last week’s winner, Amandeep Drall.The Bengalurean, who has been turning heads with some amazing golf and shooting low numbers in recent months, reaffirmed that she belongs in the big league with a gritty even-par 72 on the final day, for a tournament total of two-under 214. Amandeep (72) finished on one-under 215.“It feels great to win again,” gushed Avani. “It’s more special because I started off badly, fully out of contention, and then I came back with a good round of 66 on day two,” she added.Avani’s one-shot cushion at the start of the day was nullified when Amandeep birdied the second hole. Although the Bengaluru teenager couldn’t quite find her ‘A’ game on the day, she stayed calm and took the battle to Amandeep, who seemed to blink first, bogeying the fifth hole.Thereafter, Avani was always ahead, even taking a three-shot lead after a birdie on the 12th, where Amandeep dropped a shot. However, Avani’s bogeys on the 13th and 16th holes, saw them level once again. But she was soon in front again, when Amandeep failed to convert a 10-footer for par on the 17th hole.The ninth standard student of Greenwood High International School then parred the final hole to annex her second title on the pro tour. “I played under a lot of pressure today and didn’t succumb to it at all,” said Avani, who earned accolades and praise for her heroics and Amandeep, the moolah (Rs 1.35 lakh) as a pro.Final scores (after 54 holes): 214: Avani Prashanth (A, 76, 66, 72); 215: Amandeep Drall (70, 73, 72); 219: Jahanvi Bakshi (74, 72, 73); Vani Kapoor (75, 71, 73), Pranavi Urs (69, 74, 76); 221: Seher Atwal (71, 75, 75).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/avani-puts-pros-in-the-shade/articleshow/87215384.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Public or pvt cloud? Choose carefully: Nutanix||Bengaluru: Rajiv Ramaswami quit as COO of VMware to join rival Nutanix as CEO a little less than a year ago. He came in four months after Dheeraj Pandey, founder and then CEO of the pioneering hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) software company, made the surprise announcement that he was moving out.It has been a decent first year for Ramaswami. Nutanix’s shift about three years ago to a subscription model, from a software licensing model, looks to be paying off. Subscriptions offer greater flexibility to customers to pay for the technology over a period of time, instead of paying them upfront. And it involves less marketing costs for Nutanix.Gartner and Forrester continue to rank the San Jose-based company as the leader in the HCI market. IDC has ranked it No. 1 in India in HCI software revenue for 14 quarters in a row now.The private cloud space is the company’s bread and butter. But as the world moves increasingly to public clouds – a trend accelerated by the pandemic – Nutanix has built cloud management solutions that enable customers to take their workloads to any cloud of their choice. And they can run them using the same platform that was running their applications on-premise. But this is a more crowded space, with solutions from a range of vendors, including VMware, Microsoft, Google, AWS, and IBM, battling for supremacy. Ramaswami is convinced private cloud will remain a huge opportunity. “Yes, there is a big move to the public cloud, but data is now well spread out across public cloud, private cloud, and co-locations (data centres managed by third parties). Customers don’t want to be locked into any one cloud. There is also research recently to show that when you run stuff at scale on the public cloud, it can be quite expensive,” he said.The research he is referring to is the one by Sarah Wang and Martin Casado of American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz that came out earlier this year. Wang and Casado wrote that “as industry experience with the cloud matures, it’s becoming evident that while cloud clearly delivers on its promise early on in a company’s journey, the pressure it puts on margins can start to outweigh the benefits, as a company scales and growth slows.”They estimate that across 50 of the top public software companies currently utilising cloud infrastructure, an estimated $100 billion of market value is being lost among them due to cloud impact on margins – relative to running the infrastructure themselves. Not everyone agrees with those conclusions, but there is growing evidence that private clouds will remain a major part of IT infrastructure. A survey of CIOs by Morgan Stanley released in April finds that CIOs expect 41% of their workloads to be on-premise in 2023, and 42% in public cloud. That same figure for on-premise was 34% in the Q4, 2019, survey. Cost, Ramaswami said, is one reason for this.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/public-or-pvt-cloud-choose-carefully-nutanix/articleshow/87215395.cms||---

---||Business||NBFCs face tighter norms on capital, lending & bad loans||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday announced a revised regulatory framework for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), which tightens norms on capital and bad loan recognition. Under the revised framework, there will be many more categories of NBFCs according to their activity with the rules getting more stringent with scale. The rules also cap NBFC lending for IPO financing at Rs 1 crore per borrower. Under the new norms, the RBI will hike the net owned fund requirement for all NBFCs to Rs 10 crore. They will also have to recognise loans overdue for over 90 days as non-performing assets (NPAs) by March 2026 and over 150 days by March 2024.  Earlier in the day, RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao said that the failure of any large NBFC or housing finance company (HFC) may translate into a risk to its lenders with the potential to create a contagion. Also, the failure of any large and deeply interconnected NBFC can disrupt the operations of the small- and mid-sized NBFCs through a domino effect by limiting their ability to raise funds. Speaking at a CII event, Rao said that the liquidity stress in the sector triggered by the failure of a core investment company (IL&FS) broke the myth that NBFCs do not pose any systemic risk to the financial system. Rao said that NBFCs would be categorised into three categories — the base layer, top layer and middle layer. In terms of the new framework, the base layer will include non-deposit-taking NBFCs with assets below Rs 1,000 crore. These could include peerto-peer lending platforms, account aggregators, non-operating financial holding companies and other finance companies that do not avail public funds and do not have any customer interface. The middle layer would include deposit-taking NBFCs with assets over Rs 1,000 crore and would include primary dealers, infrastructure debt funds, core investment companies, HFCs and infrastructure finance companies. The upper layer will be specifically identified by the RBI as warranting enhanced regulatory requirements and would include the top 10 NBFCs in the country. Rao also cautioned on the malpractices of digital lenders. “While the benefits accruing from digital financial services is not a point of debate, the business conduct issues and governance standards adopted by such digital lenders have shaken the trust reposed in digital means of finance in India. We were and are inundated with the complaints of harsh recovery practices, breach of data privacy, increasing fraudulent transactions, cybercrime, excessive interest rates and harassment,” said Rao.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nbfcs-face-tighter-norms-on-capital-lending-bad-loans/articleshow/87215386.cms||---
---||Business||RBI panel held rates over poor output, uneven growth||MUMBAI: The minutes of the October monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting released on Friday reveal that members chose to hold rates despite inflation concerns as recovery was uneven and output below pre-covid level. One member, Jayanth R Varma, has again called for an increase in the reverse repo rate. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das pointed out that the classical trade-off that central banks face between slowing growth and higher inflation is getting edgier. “With the outlook overcast by several uncertainties including the fact that the pandemic is far from over, we need to ensure that the nascent revival of economic activity shows signs of durability and sustainability. At this critical juncture, our actions have to be gradual, calibrated, well-timed and well-telegraphed to avoid any undue surprises,” said Das.  Deputy governor Michael Patra said, “The formation of inflation is being buffeted by repeated shocks that have taken fuel inflation to an all-time high and turned core inflation persistent, with risks to the upside. Accordingly, it is important to remain on guard about second-order effects from these transitory perturbations that give these components of inflation a resistant character by their recurring incidence,” said Patra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-panel-held-rates-over-poor-output-uneven-growth/articleshow/87215406.cms||---

This would make the IPO the largest ever in India. The company is understood to be targeting a listing in November. According to the draft IPO documents filed by the company, One97 Communications plans to raise Rs 8,300 crore through fresh issue of equity shares and another Rs 8,300 crore through the offer for-sale (OFS) route. The Rs 16,600-crore offer will make Paytm IPO the largest listing after public sector miner Coal India’s Rs 15,990 crore IPO in 2010 and Reliance Power in 2008. Zomato’s Rs 9,375-crore IPO this year was the biggest public offering in more than a decade. The success of Zomato’s IPO has raised hopes for new age companies that are focused more on achieving scale than bottom line. One97 Communications reported a loss of Rs 1,704 crore in FY21, down 42% from the previous fiscal. Existing shareholders, which include the largest stakeholder ANT Group and employees, will be selling a stake in the OFS category. SoftBank, Elevation Capital, SAIF Partners, Berkshire Hathaway and Ratan Tata’s RNT Associates are the other investors that are listed as selling shareholders under the OFS. The success of the IPO would depend on the support it receives from international investors given the scale of the offering.The company is looking at a valuation of $20-22 billion. If the company succeeds in getting this valuation, it will be in the same league as Tata Steel or Tata Motors with valuations of around Rs 1.6 lakh crore each. Some bankers estimate that the IPO could result in foreign inflows of over $2 billion. One97 Communications, which is named after the 197-directory inquiry number used by state-owned telecom operators MTNL and BSNL, was set up as a search service in 2001 by Vijay Shekhar Sharma. It used the Paytm brand as it moved into recharge services. The company expanded into the digital wallet space and later into QR-based payments. During demonetisation, it rapidly scaled up its business and today has the larger share of merchant payments in terms of the number of merchants. Paytm Payments Bank (PPB), which is promoted by Sharma and One97 Communications, received a licence from the RBI in 2017. PPB has now sought to convert itself into a small finance bank. Besides PPB, the Paytm group includes Paytm Money. Last year, Paytm signed a deal to buy Raheja QBE General Insurance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-gets-sebi-nod-for-rs-16600-crore-ipo/articleshow/87215423.cms||---

The unit, Biocon's largest revenue generator and fastest growing, counts Tata Capital, PE firm True North and Goldman Sachs among its investors, besides Serum Institute of India, which is buying a 15% stake. The total capital raised is about $300 million. “The funds are being used for our research and development and capital expenditure,” Chandavarkar said. The biologics business received a big boost earlier this year when its insulin Glargin got an interchangeable status from the US FDA, which will help it gain market share in a country dominated by Big Pharma.The benefits of it would kick in from next year when patients and pharmacies would have the choice to choose or provide the biosimilar, unlike previously when it had to be specifically mentioned in the prescription. When asked about the unit's $1 billion revenue target, Chandavarkar said the recent deal with Serum Institute, to get access to 100 million doses of vaccines annually for 15 years, will be a shot in the arm. “It will accelerate our ability to reach the target. It will be accretive and the combination will be of a reasonable size.” He declined to quantify the accretive revenue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/biocon-biologics-not-looking-for-more-funds/articleshow/87215451.cms||Avik Das

Revenue from operations was up just 5% to Rs 1,840 crore. The results disappointed the market, with the company's share price dropping 6%.Executive chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the waning pandemic and improvements in supply chain conditions would enable all three business segments of the company - generics, biosimilars and research services - to grow faster. Generics business revenue dropped 12% to Rs 530 crore, while that of biosimilars, its most profitable segment, was up 10% to Rs 743 crore. This was driven by strong growth in India, led by the Covid-care portfolio, and continued growth in other markets.The generics business was slow due to sustained pricing pressure in the US for its formulations portfolio. “Our vertically integrated strengths in biosimilars and expansion into the infectious disease segment, provides a strong impetus for a robust and sustainable growth over the next few years,” said Arun Chandavarkar, MD of Biocon Biologics. Operating margin was up 500 basis points to 28%, while gross R&D spends remained the same at Rs 165 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/biocon-q2-profit-up-11-to-188-crore/articleshow/87215452.cms||---
---||Business||NSE, Singapore bourse team up to launch trading in GIFT City||MUMBAI: A little over three years after leading Indian bourses had threatened to cut ties with Singapore Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Friday signed a deal with SGX that will enable global investors to trade all derivative contracts based on NSE’s products at Gujarat’s GIFT City. Once the link between the two bourses stabilises, popular derivative contracts like SGX Nifty and products based on NSE’s other indices could be traded on the new platform that will be run by SGX India Connect IFSC, the joint venture company. The new trading platform will also allow global investors to trade in derivative products based on Indian stocks and indices from early morning (for investors in Japan) till late in the night (for those investors residing in the US), officials said.  In early 2018, prodded by the markets regulator Sebi, Indian bourses had decided to not allow trading in derivative products based on Indian stocks and indices since it was feared that allowing such trading would take away global investors from Indian bourses to foreign bourses. The new arrangement between NSE and SGX will allow global investors to trade in derivative products based on Indian stocks and indices on a platform that is under India’s jurisdiction. During the day, SGX India Connect IFSC also opened its office in GIFT City and announced that it would launch GIFT Data Connect. Through this connectivity, global investors will get real-time access to Nifty’s trading data, a release from the NSE said. The opening up of the new office and the data connection will enable global investors to use live NSE data to fine-tune their trading strategies ahead of the formal launch in a few months, an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nse-singapore-bourse-team-up-to-launch-trading-in-gift-city/articleshow/87215454.cms||---
---||Business||Rebuffing merger plan irked Invesco: Zee MD||MUMBAI: Zee Entertainment MD Punit Goenka has alleged that the company’s largest investor Invesco’s move to remove him from the board is to “teach me a lesson” for rebuffing its merger proposal with the media arm of a large Indian conglomerate. In a 25-page affidavit filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Goenka said Invesco’s move for a board reshuffle was “calculated”, with an intent to “control the company”, “disturb the existing management” and to “sabotage the proposed merger with Sony Pictures”. Besides the removal of Goenka, Invesco has sought the induction of multiple independent directors on the board of Zee. Goenka didn’t name the Indian conglomerate in his affidavit but Invesco had previously revealed that it had facilitated talks between the Zee MD and Reliance Industries. Goenka said he rejected Invesco’s merger proposal as it would have resulted in a massive loss to Zee shareholders in the absence of any valuation reports. Goenka revealed that during his calls with the Indian conglomerate’s representatives, he was told that if he sought information on valuation, they would not be interested in the merger. “In short, I was told that since no money was coming out of my pocket and my position (as MD in the proposed merged entity) was being secured, I should not be asking any questions and should focus on getting the deal done.” The MD further said that he was told that if he was unwilling to move forward, then Invesco would take steps to ensure the deal would have to be consummated without him. NCLT will hear the matter on October 26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rebuffing-merger-plan-irked-invesco-zee-md/articleshow/87215476.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Das was critical of RJD for “going against the alliance dharma” and not agreeing to give Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seat, where byelection will be held on October 30, to the Congress. “Congress is no more a part of Mahagathbandhan. There is no use in staying in such an alliance,” Das told a private news channel. Kusheshwar Asthan is considered the bastion of the Congress. In the 2020 assembly election, RJD had fought from Tarapur and Congress from Kusheshwar Asthan. The two parties, however, have fielded their own candidates in the byelection. Das, however, said the Congress was always ready to join hands with the parties which are fighting against the communal forces. Asked what would be the party’s stand if RJD again decides to form an alliance with the Congress, Das said, “That will be decided by the Congress high command.” Congress legislative party leader Ajit Sharma also criticised the RJD for betraying them. Sharma said unlike RJD, Congress is a national party and its role in fight against NDA cannot be ignored. “We are ready to fight on all the 40 seats and will convey this to the party high command,” Sharma told TOI, adding a final call in this regard would be taken by senior leaders of the party. However, RJD state president Jagadanand Singh told TOI that Mahagathbandhan was still intact. “I don’t know what others think,” he added. Earlier, Singh had told a private news channel that the RJD had always followed the alliance dharma. “We lost power but continued our alliance with the Congress. Laluji has always sacrificed and people will not forget this.” RJD’s state spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/ready-to-go-solo-in-state-says-congress/articleshow/87212698.cms||Sheezan Nezami

These special trains are running from different places falling under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway (ECR) to Maharashtra, New Delhi and other places enabling farmers to transport their agricultural products like vegetables, fruits, flowers, fish, meat, milk and other products outside the state. Railways had launched Kisan Rail scheme last year to provide opportunities to farmers to send their agricultural products outside the state to fetch better price of their products and explore market outside the state for their perishable or imperishable food products . According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, “Railways is running a parcel cargo Kisan Rail express train (00107/00108) between Devlali (Nasik Road) and Muzaffarpur thrice a week, a distance of about 1594 km, to cater to the needs of farmers in Bihar. Kisan Rail has been given stoppages at Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction, Buxar and Danapur. “Railways is running at least 11 more kisan rails originating from different places and passing through the ECR jurisdiction to fulfil the needs of farmers. These kisan rails are running on the New Guwahti–New Delhi via Barauni-Hajipur (00401/00402), Mainpuri–Bihara via Barauni (00416), Yamuna Bridge Agra–Joharhat Town via Barauni (00494), Yamuna Bridge Agra– Purnea via Barauni (00496), Laxmibai Nagar—Malda Town via Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction—Danapur—Hajipur (00983/00984 ), Changsari-Laxmibai Nagar via Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction (00985/00986) and Laxmibai Nagar– Bapudham Motihari ( 00987/00988 ) routes,” the CPRO said. According to the CPRO, railways is charging Rs 404 per quintal for booking vegetables and fruits from Muzaffarpur to Devlali. But it is hardly Rs 212 per quintal after giving 50 per cent subsidy. "Similarly railways charge Rs 205 per quintal between Danapur and Devlali, Rs 205 per quintal between Muzaffarpur and Manmad and Rs 144 per quintal between Patna and New Delhi and Rs 65 per quintal between Patna and Howrah on vegetables and fruits only,” he said. These parcel cargo Kisan Rail trains are running with the load combination of at least 11 parcel vans which include frozen containers.

He held the 30 years of non-Congress rule in Bihar responsible for lack of development in the state. Kanhaiya, who visited the headquarters of the state Congress at Sadaquat Ashram for the first time after joining Congress, said, “In 2025, Congress will form its government in the state,” Kanhaiya said, adding the party leaders and workers should get united and start preparing for the election. Kanhaiya said none of the governments in Bihar could compete with the progress which the state had made during Shri Krishna Babu’s tenure. “What they did for 30 years? Who is responsible for people of Bihar migrating to other places for employment, treatment and education? We get abused outside the state and even hit by the bullet,” Kanhaiya said. Training guns on RJD leaders who had criticized the Congress for poor performance in the assembly election, Kanhaiya said it was only Congress which could manage to win one seat in the Lok Sabha election from among the opposition parties. Without naming RJD national spokesperson and party’s Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha, he hit out at the latter for criticising Congress’s Bihar incharge Bhakta Charan Das. “Go and ask your boss in the drawing room as to who is Bhakta Charan Das? He is the spinal cord of social movement,” Kanhaiya said. Kanhaiya praised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for “embracing people”. Praising Congress for accepting him, Kanhaiya said it was the only party in the country where one could chant Jai Sardar, Jai Bhim as well as Jai Hind. Gujarat MLA Jigneh Mevani also hit out at the NDA leaders and said the country did not belong to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. “It is also the country of Ashfaqullah Khan and Ram Prasad Bismil,” he added. Congress leader from Gujarat Hardik Patel asked the youths to wake up and fight against the RSS and BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/congress-to-form-govt-in-bihar-in-2025-kanhaiya/articleshow/87212705.cms||Sheezan Nezami

This would make the IPO the largest ever in India. The company is understood to be targeting a listing in November. According to the draft IPO documents filed by the company, One97 Communications plans to raise Rs 8,300 crore through fresh issue of equity shares and another Rs 8,300 crore through the offer-for-sale (OFS) route. The Rs 16,600-crore offer will make Paytm IPO the largest listing after public sector miner Coal India’s Rs 15,990 crore IPO in 2010 and Reliance Power in 2008. Zomato’s Rs 9,375-crore IPO this year was the biggest public offering in more than a decade. The success of Zomato’s IPO has raised hopes for new age companies that are focused more on achieving scale than bottom line. One97 Communications reported a loss of Rs 1,704 crore in FY21, down 42% from the previous fiscal. Existing shareholders, which include the largest stakeholder ANT Group and employees, will be selling a stake in the OFS category. SoftBank, Elevation Capital, SAIF Partners, Berkshire Hathaway and Ratan Tata’s RNT Associates are the other investors that are listed as selling shareholders under the OFS. The success of the IPO would depend on the support it receives from international investors given the scale of the offering. The company is looking at a valuation of $20-22 billion. If the company succeeds in getting this valuation, it will be in the same league as Tata Steel or Tata Motors with valuations of around Rs 1.6 lakh crore each. Some bankers estimate that the IPO could result in foreign inflows of over $2 billion. One97 Communications, which is named after the 197-directory inquiry number used by state-owned telecom operators MTNL and BSNL, was set up as a search service in 2001 by Vijay Shekhar Sharma. It used the Paytm brand as it moved into recharge services. The company expanded into the digital wallet space and later into QR-based payments. During demonetisation, it rapidly scaled up its business and today has the larger share of merchant payments in terms of the number of merchants. Paytm Payments Bank (PPB), which is promoted by Sharma and One97 Communications, received a licence from the RBI in 2017. PPB has now sought to convert itself into a small finance bank. Besides PPB, the Paytm group includes Paytm Money. Last year, Paytm signed a deal to buy Raheja QBE General Insurance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-gets-sebi-nod-for-rs-16600cr-ipo/articleshow/87213938.cms||---
---||Business||Rebuffing merger plan irked Invesco: Zee MD||Reeba.Zachariah@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Zee Entertainment Enterprises MD Punit Goenka has alleged that the company’s largest investor Invesco’s move to remove him from the board is to “teach me a lesson” for rebuffing its merger proposal with the media arm of a large Indian conglomerate. In a 25-page affidavit filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Goenka also said that Invesco’s move for a board reshuffle was “calculated”, with an intent to “control the company”, “disturb the existing management” and to “sabotage the proposed merger with Sony Pictures”. Besides the removal of Goenka, Invesco has sought the induction of multiple independent directors on the board of Zee. Goenka didn’t name the Indian conglomerate in his affidavit but Invesco had previously revealed that it had facilitated talks between the Zee MD and Reliance Industries. Goenka said he rejected Invesco’s merger proposal as it would have resulted in a massive loss to Zee shareholders in the absence of any valuation reports. In the affidavit, Goenka revealed that during his calls with the Indian conglomerate’s representatives, he was told that if he sought information on valuation, they would not be interested in doing the merger. “In short, I was told that since no money was coming out of my pocket and my position (as MD in the proposed merged entity) was being secured, I should not be asking any questions and should focus on getting the deal done.” The MD, also the son of Zee founder Subhash Chandra, further said that he was told that if he was unwilling to move forward with the proposed merger, then Invesco would take steps to ensure the deal would have to be consummated without him. NCLT will hear the matter on October 26. On Friday, Zee told the Bombay high court that if the board was compelled to carry out Invesco’s demand and if the resolutions are passed at the special shareholders’ meet, they violate regulations. Zee also argued that Invesco’s appointment of six independent directors on its board means joint control. “The Companies Act has such stringent criteria for independent directors. The committee proposes it to the board. Board takes a view of appointment or rejection. There is no concept of an independent director being suggested by shareholders,” it said. “Without an agreement or special rights of nomination, someone wants to bring in six independent directors. If six out of 12 are by them, it is an attempt to take control.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rebuffing-merger-plan-irked-invesco-zee-md/articleshow/87213858.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Dr Ashutosh Mhaskar, an alumnus of MSU’s Faculty of Performing Arts, who currently heads the drama department at Palanpur’s Fine Arts College has alleged that he was not considered for the post of professor and assistant professor on highly flimsy grounds in November 2019. However, the university officials have refuted the allegations and said selection was done according to UGC guidelines. As a student of performing arts, Mhaskar had bagged eight gold medals. “I had received six gold medals after my graduation from the hands of the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi when he was invited as chief guest for annual convocation in 2003 and two after I completed my masters from the hands of nightingale Lata Mangeshkar in 2005,” said Mhaskar. Mhaskar, who completed his PhD in 2013, alleged that while his candidature for the post of the professor was not considered on the grounds that he did not have experience of being PhD guide. Instead, the current head of the dramatics department at MSU, was selected as a professor even as his PhD through convocation was pending. “The fact is that he had appeared for the interview for the post of professor merely based on PhD notification. Since, he had not received PhD through convocation, the question of being PhD guide does not arise,” said Mhaskar. He alleged that his own classmate, who had not scored first class, either at bachelors or masters level, was selected as an assistant professor. “Interviews for both the posts were conducted within a break of 10 minutes on the same day — November 26, 2019. The candidate who had appeared for the interview for the post of the professor himself appeared as an expert in the interview conducted for the post of assistant professor. The university did not even bother to change the constitution of expert panel which reflects that everything was fixed,” he alleged. Mhaskar claimed he has even filed RTIs but is not expecting proper reply from MSU officials. “I have submitted a complaint to the state education minister and even written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. When questioned, MSU registrar K M Chudasama said that the university had followed the procedure prescribed by the UGC)and the appointment was done on merits of the candidates. “Academic performance is taken into consideration for the purpose of deciding eligibility. The final selections are done based on the interview process. As per UGC notification, when it comes to appointment in performing arts there is a clause on basis of which renowned artists are evaluated. We had three candidate for the post, none of them was a PhD guide. The candidate who was selected, was Guru at National School of Drama (NSD), New Delhi,” Chudasama told TOI. “The selected candidate has also produced research based plays and has guided actors and technicials in films. Based on experiences and academic qualification of candidates, the scrutiny committee decided on selecting the current candidate,” he said adding, that all appoints were verified and approved by the state government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/six-time-topper-turned-down-for-job/articleshow/87212707.cms||---

According to the state health department officials, about 15% of the persons have taken the first dose and are due for the second but have not taken the jab – the number comes to roughly 35 lakh. Three recent notifications by the state government mandates all the commercial establishments with over 100 persons to vaccinate all the employees, all the government offices to vaccinate officers and personnel, and the vaccination status of patients at all government-run medical facilities. As of Thursday evening, the state has administered 6.8 crore vaccines with 3.53 lakh vaccinations. Three municipal corporations and five districts have achieved 100% vaccination for the first dose. Surat is the first city in the state to achieve 100% of its target for the first dose of vaccination. But when it comes to the second dose, only 52.38% have taken. Pushing for the second dose, Surat Municipal Corporation will also start checking major commercial organisations to verify if all their staff members are fully vaccinated. Among the bigger cities, Vadodara is leading the pack when it comes to administering the second jab to citizens. According to data released by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), 94.77% people in the city have taken the first dose and 70.54% took the second. VMC officials said that there was a phase when it had become evident that people were not turning up to take the second jab. "We had people calling up those whose second dose was due. Health workers too visited the houses of such persons and reminded them of the second dose," said VMC health officer Dr Devesh Patel. In Rajkot, 98.94% of the eligible population has taken the first dose of the vaccine while 56.78% have taken both the shots. The health department here is contacting all those persons who are eligible for a second dose to take it as soon as possible and gives repeated reminders.

---||Business||HC asks Zee to call EGM over Invesco demand||Reeba.Zachariah@timesgroup.com Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday asked the board of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (Zee) to call for a special shareholders’ meet as demanded by largest investor Invesco to remove MD Punit Goenka from the company. However, it added that the voting result of the special shareholders meet or extraordinary general meeting (EGM) must be “kept in abeyance” till it decides on the legality of the demand raised by Invesco. The EGM resolution will be subject to the information and broadcasting ministry’s approval, the court further said. Besides the ouster of Goenka from Zee, American fund Invesco, which holds nearly 18% in the media and entertainment company, has sought the induction of multiple independent directors on the board of the investee. The court also asked the warring parties to propose an EGM date and name of a neutral chairman to conduct the meeting. Zee will inform the court about the EGM date on Friday. In that case, Invesco will withdraw its petition against Zee from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) where it had complained that the company failed to announce an EGM date to remove Goenka. The matter at NCLT is slated for hearing on October 26. The Bombay high court said that Zee’s right to contest the validity of the resolutions after the EGM can be reserved and that it was premature to assume that the resolutions will be passed or not. Zee’s shares are widely held with 350-odd institutional investors together owning about 68% and over 2.5 lakh individuals holding 10%. Goenka and his family own about 4% in Zee, which was founded by his father Subhash Chandra in October 1992. On Thursday, the Bombay high court was hearing a case filed by Zee that sought to declare Invesco’s demand as invalid on grounds that it suffered from multiple legal infirmities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-asks-zee-to-call-egm-over-invesco-demand/articleshow/87192773.cms||Reeba Zachariah

A recent study by the University of Gothenburg in Sweden published earlier this week in medical journal ‘PLoS One’ found that 40% of the adults with Covid-19 in the ICU were obese. The study was conducted on 1,649 individuals with Covid-19 admitted in the ICUs at university and local hospitals around Sweden. The study showed that such patients had to stay for longer period in the ICU and the mortality risk among them was also higher. A report from Mumbai stated that 30% of the Covid-19 patients admitted in the ICUs were obese. However, health experts in Bihar said there were only 10% such patients in the ICUs and majorly of them from the urban areas. Covid-19 nodal in-charge at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said nearly 10% of the Covid patients admitted in the ICU at his hospital were obese. “An obese people once infected with Covid-19 and admitted to the hospital took more time to recover. During the first phase, a patient took average 12 days to recover. This increased to 16 to 20 days in the second wave. For obese people, it was 25% extra time,” said Dr Sanjeev, adding that such patients had to put more efforts for respiration. Governing body member of Association of Physician of India, Dr H S Sharma, who was also the nodal in-charge of Covid-19 ward at JLNMCH, cited almost the same percentage in his hospital. “Nearly 10 to 12% of the Covid-19 patients in the ICU had high body mass index. Also, such patients have more chances of mortality or developing pneumonia,” he said, adding such people were mostly from the urban areas as the rural population did not have obesity problems due to lifestyle. He advised people to maintain their BMI and get involved in physical activities in order to have a healthy life. Dr Israrul Haque, who was the nodal in-charge of Covid-19 at PMCH during the second wave, said though the hospital had not collected data relating Covid-19 and obesity, it is always a risk factor in any disease. “Be it any disease, an obese person is admitted to the ICU has higher chances of death compared to a person with normal body mass index,” he said. Dr Haque also cited the sedentary lifestyle as the reason for having more obese people in urban areas, compared to those living in villages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/over-10-of-cov-19-patients-in-icus-had-obesity-doctors/articleshow/87212089.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Once the link between the two bourses stabilises, popular derivative contracts like SGX Nifty and products based on NSE’s other indices could be traded on the new platform that will be run by SGX India Connect IFSC, the joint venture company. The new trading platform will also allow global investors to trade in derivative products based on Indian stocks and indices from early morning (for investors in Japan) till late in the night (for those investors residing in the US), officials said. In early 2018, prodded by the markets regulator Sebi, Indian bourses had decided to not allow trading in derivative products based on Indian stocks and indices since it was feared that allowing such trading would take away global investors from Indian bourses to foreign bourses. The new arrangement between NSE and SGX will allow global investors to trade in derivative products based on Indian stocks and indices on a platform that is under India’s jurisdiction. During the day, SGX India Connect IFSC also opened its office in GIFT City and announced that it would launch GIFT Data Connect. Through this connectivity, global investors will get real-time access to Nifty’s trading data, a release from the NSE said. The opening up of the new office and the data connection will enable global investors to use live NSE data to fine-tune their trading strategies ahead of the formal launch in a few months, an official said. As of now only Nifty futures contracts are traded on the Singapore exchange, of which SGX Nifty is the most popular one. Among others, contracts based on NSE’s Bank Nifty index are also allowed to be traded on SGX. Once the system connectivity between NSE IFSC and SGX stabilizes, all the contracts based on NSE products that are currently traded on SGX will shift to SGX India Connect IFSC platform, the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nse-spore-bourse-team-up-to-launch-trading-in-gift-city/articleshow/87213783.cms||---

Although Pappu did not take the name of leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, he seemingly came hard on him. Pappu said he had never seen such a “weak opposition” in the state. Pappu added the JAP-L members from the Kosi and Seemanchal regions would campaign for the Congress from Saturday. “I will also camp in the constituencies from October 26,” he added. The campaigning for the byelection will end on October 28 and the polling will take place on October 30. As the campaigning for the two seats is picking up, the Congress has gone out whole hog to strengthen the stakes of its two candidates – Atirek Kumar in Kusheshwar Asthan and Rajiv Mishra in Tarapur. Curiously, Pappu had earlier expressed his intention to contest the bypoll from Tarapur, but shelved the plan after the Congress decided to field its candidate there. Pointing out that Tejashwi was not in a position to become the state’s CM without the support of the 19 Congress MLAs, Pappu said, “He (Tejashwi) has joined hands with the BJP which I have been repeatedly saying.” Pappu said he would pay Rs 50 lakh to the state government to bring back in a chartered plane the Bihari migrants from Jammu & Kashmir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pappu-will-support-congress-candidates/articleshow/87212722.cms||Abhay Singh

Profit grew to Rs 15,479 crore in the Q2FY22. Revenue totalled over Rs 1.7 lakh crore, up 50%, as markets revived after the second wave of the pandemic in Q1FY22. Operating profit edged up 30% to Rs 30,283 crore in the July through September months, aided by strong earnings in its three main businesses. “The results demonstrate the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All our businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,” said chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani. Operating profit of O2C increased 44% to Rs 12,720 crore due to higher volumes and price realisations. The company had combined its refining and petrochemicals units to form O2C. Operating profit of digital services climbed 15% to Rs 9,561 crore due to higher data usage by subscribers. However, average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key metric that influences income — was slightly down to Rs 144 in Q2FY22. ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Launched in 2016, Jio has 430 million customers (as of September end, down from previous quarter’s 441 million) and saw data and voice traffic growth of 51% and 18%, respectively, on its network. ARPU in the year-ago period was Rs 145. Operating profit of the retail business rose 44% to Rs 2,923 crore as pandemic-related curbs eased operating conditions and vaccines helped in lifting sales. RIL said it saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer sentiments amid festivities. Grocery and consumer electronics maintained growth momentum, while fashion and lifestyle saw sales closing above pre-Covid levels. To be sure, RIL had transferred the petro-retailing business to a joint venture with BP. Operating profit of financial services plunged 64% to Rs 190 crore. Oil & gas, which recently turned around with revival in KG-D6 gas production, made an operating profit of Rs 1,071 crore. While, operating profit of the media unit zoomed 52% to Rs 253 crore. RIL’s debt at the end of Q2FY22 was Rs 2.55 lakh crore. But RIL had more than enough in cash and cash equivalents (about Rs 2.59 lakh crore) to cover its debt.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-q2-net-jumps-46-on-oil-digital-retail-biz/articleshow/87213886.cms||---

Byelection will be held in two assembly constituencies – Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga and Tarapur in Munger – on October 30. In the video, Tejashwi’s vehicle could be seen bumping on a muddy and uneven road. “I challenge Nitish Kumar, who has been the CM for 16 years, to visit Kusheshwar Asthan by road. Kusheshwar Asthan had been contributing to his victory for 16 years. He is afraid of people and truth that is why he flies in a helicopter (sic),” Tejashwi tweeted. On Thursday, Tejashwi has shared a video of a village in Kusheshwar Asthan in which an old man could be seen complaining about bad roads and requesting the former to get them constructed. Tejashwi, who is on a campaign trail at Kusheshwar Asthan, talked about price rise, unemployment, lack of good schools, hospitals, industries and migration. “These are the real agendas, but NDA is busy spreading hatred and talking about religions,” he said while addressing a gathering at Barra panchayat in Kusheshwar Asthan. Hitting back at Tejashwi, JD (U)’s state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said by showing one road, the reality of Bihar’s road cannot be judged. “Central government has asked the other states to follow Bihar’s model to have quality roads.

Sewer networks are being laid to connect all the households to the STPs so that untreated water does not get discharged into the Ganga directly. The foundation for the plants, which have a capacity to treat 200 million litres of wastewater per day, was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Mokama in Patna district in October 2017. According to sources, the wastewater will be treated through sequencing batch reactor system and used for irrigation after chlorination. Ramavtar Sah, the chief engineer of Namami Gange Programme as part of which the plants are being installed, told this reporter, “The STPs at Beur, Karmalichak, Saidpur, and Pahadi and their sewer networks will be ready and made functional by March 2022.” He added, “The wastewater will be discharged into the Ganga or other tributaries only after being treated.” Two other STPs at Digha and Kankerbagh are in the initial stage of construction. While the one at Digha will have a 228km-long sewer network, the Kankerbagh STP will have a 150km-long sewer network.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/four-stps-to-be-made-functional-by-march-22/articleshow/87212030.cms||Faryal Rumi

The President, whose three-day Patna stay ended on Friday, also visited Mahavir Mandir, Buddha Smriti Park and Khadi Mall in the city along with his family members. Wearing traditional head scarves, the President paid obeisance to the last Sikh Guru at Darbar Hall (the Royal Court) at Takhat Sri Harimandir Ji Patna Sahib amid the chanting of mantras. He was received by Awatar Singh Hit, president of Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee and four other office-bearers. After “parikrama”, the President saw the artefacts and ‘shastra’ of Guru Gobind Singh. A gold-plated memento with a picture of Guru Gobind Singh, shawl and ‘kirpan’ were presented to Kovind who interacted with the officials at the gurdwara. He also ate “kada” prasad before his departure at 8.50am. At Mahavir Temple near Patna Junction, the President and his family members offered prayers and “naivedyam laddoo” as prasad to Lord Hanuman and spent around 17 minutes there. During the period, public darshan was restricted at the temple. They were received by secretary of Mahavir Mandir Trust Acharya Kishore Kunal and temple’s trustee Shweta Maharathi. Kovind was seen briefing his wife about the importance of the temple. Kunal said the First Lady expressed her desire to offer prayer to Lord Hanuman before ‘aarti’. “As there was no ‘karam kandi (ritualistic priests)’ inside the temple, I conducted the prayer for the first time,” Kunal added. Kunal said the President also enquired about the other institutions and the development of Viraat Ramayan Mandir, which is being built at Kesariya in West Champaran. The representatives of Mahavir temple presented a shawl and a gold-made replica of Viraat Ramayan Mandir to the President. Later, Kovind visited Dhamam meditation hall at Buddha Smriti Park, where he did ‘Vipasana’ for 10 minutes with his family members. He also visited the Karuna Stupa and offered prayers. The President also visited Khadi Mall near Gandhi Maidan where he bought cloth for himself. His wife and daughter bought saris. They paid homage to Bapu’s statue and tried their hand at the eight-spindle charkha at the mall. State industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said the President’s visit to the mall would boost the morale of the weavers across the state. The President left for New Delhi by a special flight around 11.45am.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/prez-offers-prayers-at-gurdwara-mahavir-temple-before-leaving-patna/articleshow/87211989.cms||Faryal Rumi

Amid increased pushback in India and globally over its app store policies, Google said on Thursday that it is reducing by half (15% from 30%) its app store fees for all subscription-based services starting January 1, 2022. However, ADIF insists until the Competition Commission concludes its investigation on Google’s policy of mandatory use of its billing system, status quo needs to be maintained, and Google should not be allowed to implement its policy of “forced adoption of their billing system” starting March 2022. “What developers are asking for is fairness and not benevolence in the form of “reduced” commission percentages. It has never been about the percentages. Price discovery should be left to the market forces. As long as Google gets to unilaterally dictate prices and people don’t have choices, it's still a Lagaan – be it 30, 15 or even 2, the percentages do not matter,” said Sijo Kuruvilla George, executive director, ADIF. “While the commission percentage is one of the issues as Google’s charges are very high compared to about 2% charged by other payment processing systems, the core issue is about Google not allowing developers to use other payment gateways,” Murugavel Janakiraman, founder and CEO, Matrimony.com, and a founding member of ADIF said. ADIF insists that Google should operate in the best interest of all developers, and not just the ones already on their billing system. The announcement might come as a source of happiness for the subset of developers who are already on the Google billing system but not others, ADIF said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-slashing-commission-rates-does-not-address-larger-issues-adif/articleshow/87213495.cms||---

One member, Jayanth R Varma, has again called for an increase in the reverse repo rate. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das pointed out that the classical trade-off that central banks face between slowing growth and higher inflation is getting edgier. “With the outlook overcast by several uncertainties including the fact that the pandemic is far from over, we need to ensure that the nascent revival of economic activity shows signs of durability and sustainability. At this critical juncture, our actions have to be gradual, calibrated, well-timed and well-telegraphed to avoid any undue surprises,” said Das. Deputy governor Michael Patra said, “The formation of inflation is being buffeted by repeated shocks that have taken fuel inflation to an all-time high and turned core inflation persistent, with risks to the upside. Accordingly, it is important to remain on guard about second-order effects from these transitory perturbations that give these components of inflation a resistant character by their recurring incidence.” Executive director Mriddul Saggar noted that the momentum in prices is expected to pick up in H2:2021-22 and there are upside risks and stickiness of core that warrant attention. “In my assessment, the probability that oil prices may touch or cross $85/barrel before the year ends and could average $80/barrel or more in H2 are not insignificant,” he said. While Varma voted to hold rates he said he was not in favour of the decision to keep the reverse repo rate at 3.35%, and voted against the accommodative stance. “Raising effective money market rates quickly towards 4% would demonstrate the MPC’s commitment to the inflation target, help anchor expectations, reduce risk premia, enhance macroeconomic stability, and allow lower long-term interest rates to be sustained for longer thereby aiding the economic recovery”. He said that the repo rate of 4% corresponds to a negative real rate in the range of 1-1.5% based on forwarding looking inflation forecasts. “In my view, this level of rates is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-panel-held-rates-over-poor-output-uneven-growth/articleshow/87213833.cms||---

---||Delhi||Bolt from the blue: Bangladeshi artist’s show put off indefinitely||NEW DELHI: Rokeya Sultana was scheduled to hold a solo exhibition in the Lalit Kala Akademi from October 23. The disappointed Bangladeshi artist is now making plans to return home over the weekend. Her show has been indefinitely postponed by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). The inauguration of the exhibition and book launch was supposed to have been attended by Union minister of state for external affairs and culture Meenakshi Lekhi and ICCR president Dr Vinay Sahasrabuddhe. However, Sultana said she was told that due to “unavoidable circumstances”, the exhibition was abruptly postponed, the news only communicated to her two days before the scheduled opening. Stating that she didn’t want to dwell on the exact reason for the postponement of the event and whether it was linked to the communal disturbances in Bangladesh, Sultana said, “I do not understand these things. I believe in humanity, harmony and peace. The exhibition was supposed to be a retrospective of the work I have done in the last 35 years.” Sultana, who had reached the city on October, 13 said, “We were mostly ready with the displays for the exhibition but were suddenly told that it was being postponed due to unavoidable circumstances. We have been told that we will be informed about a new date for the show. For now, I will have to leave the artwork behind and return home since they have already been framed for the exhibition. There also are some sculptures and animations.” Art curator Ina Puri said that while the postponement was “disappointing”, ICCR was hoping to showcase the exhibition soon. “What is sad is the fact that the whole exhibition was curated keeping India in mind. Sultana has studied under good tutelage at Santiniketan in West Bengal and this was her way of expressing gratitude to those who taught her,” said Puri. “It was supposed to be a retrospective exhibition and we had invested a lot in it. While no one is to blame for the present circumstances, we just hope that we are able to organise the exhibition here soon.” Stating that the exhibition was supposed to be a landmark one, Puri added that the show would also have marked 50 years of India-Bangladesh relations. When reached for a comment, Sahasrabuddhe responded, “There is no comment to be made. It is a routine thing and this sort of thing keeps happening. This is an administrative decision.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bolt-from-the-blue-bangladeshi-artists-show-put-off-indefinitely/articleshow/87214383.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Delhi||Footfall up four-fold this year, Delhi Metro still set to lose Rs 1,500 crore||NEW DELHI: When the Delhi Metro services resumed in September last year after being shut down for 169 days due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the capital’s transport lifeline logged 6-7 lakh passenger trips a day. In September this year, the average passenger trips per day had gone up to 28 lakh. However, despite the fourfold increase in ridership, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is staring at an estimated loss of Rs 1,500 crore in the 2021-22 financial year. The pandemic resulted in DMRC’s revenue nosediving from Rs 3,897.3 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 895.9 crore in 2020-21. While DMRC had a surplus of Rs 758 crore in 2019-20, the last fiscal saw the train company recording a deficit of Rs 1,784.9 crore. The first quarter of the current financial year coincided with the second wave of Covid-19 cases and saw train services being closed to the general public for 48 days. With metro trains allowed only 50% of its seating capacity and no standing passengers, DMRC ended up spending more on operations than earning. From July-end, however, after 100% seating with no standing passengers was permitted, there was some respite for both commuters and DMRC. That, however, wasn’t enough to pull DMRC into the black. “We haven’t yet returned to a position where we can meet all our expenditures but the gap is reducing by the day,” DMRC managing director Mangu Singh told TOI. “We had a loss of around Rs 1,700 crore last year and expect a loss of another Rs 1,500 crore this year.” He said that DMRC would have ended up with a bigger loss of Rs 2,100 last year but for its efforts to improve revenue and curtail expenditure without affecting operations and safety-related expenses. “Many more people want to use the metro now, but we are unable to carry them because of the restrictions,” Singh said. “After the pandemic is over, the metro system will certainly be the preferred option because of reliability, comfort and ease of transportation.” He hoped that commuters forced to use private vehicles at the moment will return to the metro. Singh said that by the end of March 2022, DMRC would have run up a total deficit of Rs 3,200 crore. This issue was taken up in the recent meeting of the company’s board of directors. “The board has agreed to approach all our stakeholders to share this loss,” he said. “We have apportioned the entire losses of Rs 3,200 crore year-wise, on a pro-rata basis and as per the principle set down by the sanction order of the project, among the four governments — the Centre and the state governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. We have written to them to support us.” Apart from the earnings from the fare, the revenue earned by DMRC through leasing of retail areas, parking lots and commercial complexes were also hit when Covid curtailed train services. Singh said that DMRC, however, ensured that those who had rented spaces didn't ‘run away’ even when the metro services were shut down. “We did not ask for rents for the affected period. Once the train services restarted, we gave the lessors the facility to adjust their rental based on the footfall in a transparent manner,” the DMRC managing director said, adding that if the footfall was half or a third of the normal, the rental was accordingly adjusted. Singh said that these measures have helped and clients have retained their leased space. Even if the rental income was lower than in pre-Covid times, DMRC was still earning rent income, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/footfall-up-four-fold-this-year-metro-still-set-to-lose-rs-1500-cr/articleshow/87213663.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Diwali trips in hired cabs get costly||Ahmedabad: Amid concerns over using public transport – both flights and trains – in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, road trips are a big hit among travellers. While surging petrol and diesel prices are a bane for travellers looking to hit the road, even cab fares have already gone up by at least 20% in the past one month. But making matters worse, the festive season fares are even higher. Estimates by private cab owners suggest that per kilometre cost to hire an SUV have increased from Rs 13 to Rs 15 and it will range from Rs 18-20 during Diwali festival days i.e. from October 30 till November 9, in the wake of high demand. Similarly, costs for hiring a sedan car have already increased by 20% to Rs 12 a kilometre and the same will cost Rs 15 a kilometre during festival days. “Due to increase in fuel costs, we were compelled to raise prices by an estimated 20%. Our profit margins are eroded due to rise in prices,” said Chandresh Patel, president, Gujarat Luxury Cab Owners’ Association (GLCOA). “The bookings for Diwali holidays are so good that we’ve started recovering business that was lost in the past years and this is a good sign for our business. People who have not travelled since the pandemic have now confidently begun moving out,” said Amit Shah, past secretary, GLCOA. Uptakes to Dwarka, Somnath, Gir, Diu, Daman, Silvassa, Saputara, Shirdi, Nashik, Udaipur, Mount Abu, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Goa are looking up in a big way, according to private cab operators. “People prefer road trips to long-distance air travel and therefore, are hiring cabs or driving down themselves too. Due to Covid-19, people are still apprehensive of taking trains or flights to destinations and therefore prefer going by road with a closed, known group of people. Moreover, flights are expensive during festive season due to dynamic pricing making roadtrips quite popular,” said Manish Sharma, chairman, TAFI – Gujarat. In fact, car service workshops are also remaining fully occupied with service requests, given the Diwali travel plans. “Those who are driving down longer distances over Diwali holidays are coming up with full servicing requests or addressing major to minor issues to avoid breakdowns. We’re running fully occupied till Diwali,” said a city-based workshop owner, without willing to be named.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/diwali-trips-in-hired-cabs-get-costly/articleshow/87213662.cms||Niyati Parikh

Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy was expected to inaugurate the projects on October 23. But his programme in city was cancelled at the last moment on Friday night. The projects awaiting inauguration include NAD flyover project (Rs 150 crore), VMRDA park redevelopment project ( Rs 33.5 crore), multilevel car parking facility ( Rs 11.5 crore), heritage conservation projects including town hall ( Rs 4.25 crore) and old municipal office ( Rs 7.16 crore), master plan roads, and community hall projects. The flyover project at the NAD Junction in the city was first proposed by the VMRDA in 2015 as a long-term measure to ease the ever growing traffic in the busiest junction of the city. The VMRDA finalised the bids for this multi-level grade separator in September 2017. Several issues, including sand shortage and Covid-19, affected the progress of the flyover project. The VMRDA also completed the works on the master plan road, connecting NH-16 and beach road via Visakha Valley School, with an outlay of Rs 7 crore. The chief minister was also supposed to inaugurate the master plan road, connecting Law College road and beach road via Peda Rushikonda, developed spending Rs 7.5 crore.. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has redeveloped the VMRDA park on the beach road with about Rs 34 crore. Even though park belongs to the VMRDA, the GVMC funded the park redevelopment as a convergence project under Smart City initiative. The multilevel car parking facility mooted under Vizag Smart City project has come up on a 367.8 square metre land pocket next to Jagadamba Junction. According to the GVMC officials, the semi-automatic puzzle car parking facility can house 100 cars. The GVMC had also taken up the restoration works of the historic town hall building and the old municipal office located in the One Town area under the Smart City project. Reminders of the rich heritage of the city, these two buildings had faded into obscurity. The GVMC developed these two structures spending about Rs 15 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/completed-projects-await-formal-opening/articleshow/87213661.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The TTD has not lifted restrictions on pilgrim footfall in Tirumala over fears of the perceived third wave of Covid-19 despite the situation easing to near pre-Covid levels in many parts of the state and across the country, due to which there is an unprecedented demand for darshan tickets among devotees. At 9 am on Friday, soon after the online quota of Rs 300 special entry darshan tickets was released for the last two months of the year, the tickets were completely sold out within three hours. TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy said no glitches were reported during the booking of tickets on its website and devotees had a hassle-free booking experience for a second consecutive month. “Unlike in the past when the TTD website froze for hours together whenever online quota of darshan tickets were released, no glitches were reported,” he said. Subba Reddy added that the temple body will soon revive ‘divya darshan” for the convenience of devotees who trek up to Tirumala through the Alipiri pedestrian route which was recently renovated and reopened by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/over-7l-darshan-tickets-sold-in-less-than-3-hours/articleshow/87213667.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Delhi was hit by a brutal second wave of the pandemic in April-May, which claimed a massive number of lives daily, and the oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals had added to the woes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/38-fresh-covid-cases-in-delhi-one-death-positivity-rate-0-07/articleshow/87213669.cms||---
---||Goa||OPDs now functional at South Goa hospital||PANAJI: While all out patient departments (OPDs) have moved to the new South Goa district hospital for want of space at the old Hospicio Hospital, the casualty ward continues to function there along with surgery branches. With the CT scan being commissioned at the new facility, the move of the surgery and casualty departments to the new hospital is expected to happen shortly. The medicine wards, followed by gynaecology which receive the highest footfalls were the first to be shifted to the new hospital after the last Covid-19 patient was discharged on October 12. The new spacious multi-storied South Goa district hospital was catering only to a handful Covid-19 patients while non-Covid-19 patients were struggling with acute shortage at the old Hospicio Hospital with more and more people coming out to access medical treatment. The South Goa district hospital, however, continues to assess Covid-19 patients with a separate casualty bay area for them, but no Covid-19 patients are admitted at this facility. “They come in for X-rays, to check their oxygen saturation level, collect home isolation kits and receive medication,” a hospital staffer said. The anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for HIV patients will continue at the old hospital where a palliative care centre will be set up along with an Ayush treatment clinic. The district early-intervention centre functioning from T B hospital at Monte will be moved to the old Hospicio Hospital. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) is yet to prepare the parking area for patients behind the hospital which is over-run with vegetation and patients’ vehicles are therefore being permitted to park outside the gate. “The staff is parking in the basement. There’s no place for other people to park. If we allow them inside they will start blocking the path of the ambulance and oxygen trucks,” a hospital staffer said. GSIDC is also going to construct a bus-bay outside the hospital, but is expected to delay the work until the Public Works Department (PWD) digs up the road in front of the hospital to lay the sewerage line, which was laid outside the South Goa collectorate recently. Should the bus-bay be built first, there are apprehensions that PWD will begin digging to lay sewerage lines, leading to wastage of taxpayers’ money.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/opds-now-functional-at-south-goa-hospital/articleshow/87214393.cms||---

The victims, residents of Nagla Anoop village in Firozabad area of Uttar Pradesh, were returning home from Gogamedi temple in Rajasthan's Hanumangarh district when the accident occured. Out of the eight deceased, seven were from the same family. The eighth was their neighbour. Three others have been injured. Speaking to TOI, Jasveer Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Badli in Jhajjar district, said, “The accident took place at 3.30am. The driver had stopped the car behind a stationary truck on one side of the road to take a break. A truck, whose driver probably couldn’t see the car, hit it from behind.” He added that on the basis of a complaint received from the relatives of the family, an FIR has been registered under IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death due to negligence) and others against the truck driver, who is absconding. The eight deceased were identified as Shiv Kumar Vajpayee (57), his wife Munni Devi (55), son Manoj (26) and his wife Ruby (23), daughter Khushboo (22) and neighbour Babloo (32) from Bihar who worked as a labourer at a cold storage. Shiv Kumar was a farmer. Manoj’s six-month-old daughter Vanshika and Shiv Kumar’s elder daughter’s son Priyanshu (14) also died on the spot. Shiv Kumar’s daughter Aarti (25), her daughter Ansi (2) and driver Monu (24) were hurt and taken to hospital.

Led by Shadow Council convener Savio Coutinho, the protesters demanded that the Covid ward with a minimum number of beds be set up for the benefit of patients from South Goa. Coutinho told reporters that while shifting of Hospicio to the new district hospital was definitely a welcome move, closure of the Covid ward was unacceptable. “The reasons cited for the closure is the less number of Covid patients seeking admission. Does it mean that Covid-positive patients from South Goa should suffer because the health department finds it a burden to manage a Covid ward at the South Goa district hospital?” Coutinho said. Stating that he received a call on Friday morning seeking help for a 90-year old person who tested positive for Covid, Coutinho said he was amazed to learn upon enquiries that the district hospital has closed admissions for Covid patients there. “How much of an inconvenience it may have been for this patient to travel to Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, can well be imagined,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/stir-at-south-goa-dist-hosp-over-covid-ward-closure/articleshow/87214391.cms||---

Pointing out that the sprinkler system did not start after the alarm, they claimed the builder has not handed over maintenance of the building to the housing society. The A wing was unaffected. The arrival of the fire brigade was delayed by the heavy traffic in the area and they finally brought the flames under control at around 3.30pm. By 5pm, more than five hours after the fire started, it was put out. A 30-year-old security guard died. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, who visited the site with mayor Kishori Pednekar and other senior civic officials, ordered a probe. “A full administrative inquiry will be conducted. Also, complaints will be investigated and if facts are found in it, strict action will be taken against the concerned,” said Chahal. The fire is believed to have started in the flat of the Rathod family, who had moved in three weeks ago. Officials said furniture work was going on in the flat.

As a fire blazes in the flat, he extends his legs to the left in a bid to get a toehold on a ledge, but the wall in between is too wide. His left hand slips,“We get mock drills done frequently and insist that everyone on the premises — from residents to their help — attend it. We have fixed imported fire-fighting equipment and while due to panic there might have been a delay in operating the system, it did operate fully once it was started,” said Agarwal. Asked about residents’ allegations that the society has yet not been handed over, he said they have written to the deputy registrar but have been unable to hold at AGM as large gatherings are restricted due to the pandemic. The fire brigade recorded that a fire call was received at 11.46am. Vehicles were immediately dispatched, but reached at 12.02pm. “Upon reaching the site, we found the firefighting equipment had not yet started. We immediately began to operate the hose and riser systems which were present,” said Rajendra Chaudhary, deputy chief fire officer (technical). Fourteen fire engines, 9 jumbo water tankers, 90m and 55m turntables were pressed into action. “The fire was first designated as level 3, but later upgraded to level 4. The security guard was trying to escape the fire and fell down,” said an official. “Residents have complained that a lot of work is pending as the society has not been handed over to the residents by the builder and blamed it for the fire. I have directed the administration to take necessary action after conducting a proper inquiry into the complaints,” said mayor Pednekar. “Tiwari’s life might have been saved if the security personnel or similar personnel had provided emergency assistance before the arrival of the fire brigade vehicles,” she added. Swapnaja Kshirsagar, assistant municipal commissioner of F-South ward, said once they receive clearance from the fire brigade, they would be checking if any additions and alterations were done in the flat. On Friday evening, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray visited One Avighna Park. “This incident in a highrise only reiterates how important fire safety drills, fire safety norms like sprinklers, fire refuge areas are in every building. I met and thanked the brave jawans of the Mumbai Fire Brigade for their swift response,” said Aaditya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-firefighting-system-in-towers-stayed-inert-till-firemen-came/articleshow/87213685.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Of, by and for women: Central Delhi police launch Pink Booths to resolve grievances||NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, “Pink Booths” manned by all-women staff were started in Central district on Friday. These booths would provide a safe complaint redressal mechanism, cater to grievances of women and girls and take immediate legal action on their complaints, apart from dealing with other issues. Women beat staff are also being deployed for the first time in the area. DCP (Central) Shweta Chauhan said, “One such Pink Booth has been started at Karol Bagh police station. This is an attempt to provide a safe complaint redressal mechanism for women and girls in busy marketplaces.” “Earlier, only male staff were deployed in beats for traditional policing. But now, Central district has started a path-breaking initiative by deploying all women staff in earmarked beat areas of every police station to curb all types of crimes and ensure safety and security of citizens,” added the DCP. Called “Prashakti Beat Staff”, these women cops have been deployed to control and prevent street crime. Another team of women cops, called “Veera Squad”, would be deployed for intensive patrolling to control crime against women and children and keep an eye on hardcore criminals. This squad would patrol on ERVs, QRTs, motorcycles and scooters. “The aim of creation of Veera Squad and Prashakti Beat Staff is to bring women officers to the forefront in traditional policing roles of crime prevention and detection, which were earlier considered male bastions. This will see increased participation of women officers at every level of policing. They will play an important role in crime prevention, detection and investigation, including robbery, snatching, pick-pocketing, burglary and organised crime,” said Chauhan. Women officers were earlier deployed mainly for sensitisation of women and children and for tackling crimes against women. “But now, apart from the above agenda, they will also be deployed in beats to tackle hardcore criminals as well as have increased participation in community policing. Women staff has also been posted in Cyber Cell and Special Staff of Central district,” the DCP said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/of-by-and-for-women-central-delhi-police-launch-pink-booths-to-resolve-grievances/articleshow/87213682.cms||---
---||Amaravati||AP: YSRC focusing on increasing voter turnout in Badvel bypoll||AMARAVATI: Ruling YSRC has set their focus on increasing voter turnout in the upcoming Badvel assembly by-election to improve the party nominee’s majority. Several senior leaders are vigorously campaigning in the villages, conducting padayatras, and holding discussions with booth-level leaders. The party’s by-elections strategy committee chief and panchayat raj minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy has held several rounds of discussions with senior leaders, including ministers and legislators, who have been assigned specific tasks. “Bringing voters to the polling booth is crucial. Besides meeting each and every possible voter in the constituency and seeking their support, making them exercise their franchise on polling day is much more important,” Peddireddi told them. YSRC has set a target of winning the seat by a margin of over one lakh votes as TDP is not in the fray this time, and it is not taking BJP and Congress candidates as serious contestants. The party fears that people may take the election lightly as it looks like a one-sided contest. “Booth-level leaders and agents must ensure that people visit the polling booth. Our margin will improve only if the turnout is higher because people are happy with the welfare schemes being implemented by the government,” said YSRC general secretary and government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. Meanwhile, the BJP has deputed senior leaders, including the party’s affairs in-charge Sunil Deodhar, national secretary Satya Kumar, and former minister Kanna Lakshminarayana to the constituency. Deodhar met the electorate in Atlur village and sought their support. He told locals that the state government is implementing over 80% of its welfare schemes using central funds. Lakshminarayana went around villages in Porumamilla mandal and appealed people to extend support to P Suresh. Criticising the government for not completing major infrastructure projects granted by the Centre, like the Bangalore-Kadapa railway line, he said the project is getting delayed despite PM Narendra Modi personally requesting AP government to release its share of funds.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||High drama in corp council, oppn continues protest||Thiruvananthapuram: The corporation council became the venue for dramatic scenes on Friday as BJP councillors, who have been on a protest mode, improvised their mode of dissent minutes ahead of council meeting. The BJP councillors chose specific points around the council hall and were seen lying in groups; two each for one entry point; blocking the path of ruling councillors and Mayor Arya Rajendran. Senior LDF councillors and even UDF councillors who had not anticipated the hurdle had to jump the handrails, step over the chairs and had to make their way to the respective places. A group of LDF councillors huddled at the entry point of the mayor where BJP councillors were lying blocking the path. The LDF too was bent on not giving in to pressure tactics of the BJP and holding the council. Accompanied by female police officers the mayor was helped to her way to the chair by LDF councillors evading the BJP members who had blocked her path. The LDF councillors clapped and cheered once the mayor successfully breached the blockade and reached her chair. She had to speak loud as the BJP councillors resorted to sloganeering in the council hall. Meanwhile, the UDF councillors also pulled out placards mocking the corporation for its corrupt ways. Unmindful of the noise that rang around her, the mayor asked the heads of standing committees to read out the agenda. She then declared all items on the agenda passed. Welfare standing committee chairman S Salim presented a verbal resolution strongly condemning the manner in which the BJP has disrupted the functioning of the council. He said that the BJP’s undemocratic ways of protest has hindered the efforts of the corporation in even holding a council meeting. Meanwhile, LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil said the LDF councillors would file a complaint against BJP councillors for blocking the way to the council hall. The mayor concluded the session in less than 10 minutes and said that the council was successfully convened. However, the BJP councillors continued with protests and raised slogans. Later attending a news conference the mayor said that the ruling council had tried twice to negotiate with the BJP and UDF to resolve the protests. “They are spreading fake narratives. We have already decided to publish the full list of tax defaulters and other details. Good suggestions; whatever they have proposed, have already been decided in the steering committee. As regarding the demand to pass a resolution to arrest everyone in connection with tax fraud, it is up to the police,” she said, adding that the corporation has done everything in its power to act strongly against the erring officials. The mayor added that she did not find any lapses in police investigation and if at all any laxity is spotted, matter will be taken up. She said she had met with the Chief Minister regarding this issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/high-drama-in-corp-council-oppn-continues-protest/articleshow/87213680.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Hoping to get approval for Shakti Act in winter session: Walse Patil||Nagpur: State home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Friday said he will ensure that the Shakti Act gets approval during the forthcoming winter session of the state legislature scheduled in December in the city. Through the Act, Walse Patil hopes that rape survivors would get speedy justice. During a series of online inauguration of police facilities at Vanamati, the home minister also urged the top brass to ensure ‘zero tolerance’ towards narcotics, action against racketeers at par with the security forces’ aggressive approach towards Naxalism and curbing the city’s crime rate with ‘smart policing’. He also urged cops to be courteous to citizens at police stations. Later, during an informal interaction with the media, Walse Patil backed police chief Amitesh Kumar’s decision to close down Ganga Jamuna, the city’s red-light area, stating, there was opposition by local residents. Earlier in the day, chief minister Uddhav Thackarey, during the inauguration of the state’s first wildlife forensic laboratory and fast track DNA testing unit under the Nirbhaya Yojana at the regional forensic science laboratory (RFSL), urged the police department to remain ahead of the outlaws technically and tactically to facilitate better prevention and detection. He also assured the forensic department of government support in terms of manpower, infrastructure and other logistics. Walse Patil, who inaugurated rest rooms for personnel at different police stations, 288 residential quarters and the new building of Hudkeshwar police station, said the city police have their task cut out as the national crime records bureau (NCRB) has indicated a trend of increased crime rate. “No compromise on crime control would be tolerated,” he said, expressing reversal of the current crime trend through CP Kumar, Joint CP Aswati Dorje and their teams. “The influx of migrants from neighbouring states could be attributed to the rising crime graph triggered by various addictions. The cause of crime needs to be ascertained,” he said. Walse Patil also said that 95% of crime against women is perpetrated by persons known to them and the remaning by strangers. “If the assaulter is a known person then the challenge before the police is even bigger. City police are now in the middle of a study to ascertain the cause of the increased crime rate. A trend has been witnessed in the city in which it is evident that crime is more in the months of May, June and October,” he said. Walse Patil, who chaired two crime review meetings with the city police and their district counterparts, is learnt to have urged the cops to be more sensitive and prompt with cases of assault against women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hoping-to-get-approval-for-shakti-act-in-winter-session-walse-patil/articleshow/87212905.cms||Soumitra Bose

The police identified the accused as Anilkumar alias Jango Kumar, 37, of Vinayaka Nagar at Kochu Veli. The alleged crime took place on Thursday night around 10 pm at Goods Yard Colony at Kochu Veli. The officers who faced the attack include Pettah sub-inspector P Ratheesh and his subordinates. A team of police officers led by the SI reached the colony after receiving a complaint from the residents here that Anilkumar was terrorising the local residents using crude explosives. They were attacked while trying to apprehend the accused. Fortunately, none of the officers sustained serious injuries in the attack. Anilkumar, a known habitual offender had committed similar offences in the past too. A year ago, an officer attached to Pettah police station was injured in a similar attack by him using explosives. Officer Udayakumar suffered hearing impairment after sustaining injuries on one of his ears. Anilkumar was arrested in that case and it was only a few weeks ago he was released from prison on bail. The accused has been produced before the court on Friday and remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/criminal-arrested-for-attacking-police-team/articleshow/87213707.cms||---

As a fire blazes in the flat, he extends his legs to the left in a bid to get a toehold on a ledge, but the wall in between is too wide.  His left hand slips, and he tumbles down to shrieks of horror. The video showing the last moments of Arun Tiwari, which reminded many of people falling from the flaming World Trade Center on 9/11, has gone viral. In a cruel turn of fate, Tiwari crashed down on the first fire engine that had just arrived on the scene and died before the fire-fighters could reach him. The 30-year-old guard, who had been working in the building for five years, was rushed to hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Relatives who arrived to collect the body said Tiwari, who was from Prayagraj (Allahabad), was not married and leaves behind an old mother, brother and his family. Mukesh Pandey, who had come to claim his body at KEM hospital, said Tiwari’s mother has been informed and asked to come to Mumbai for his last rites. “He had gone to the 19th floor after hearing the fire alarm but got trapped by the spreading flames. He could not find a way to escape from the fire. Unfortunately, he tried to escape from the balcony but got stuck,” said Pandey. Tiwari’s other distraught family members said he had been living in Mumbai for a decade and started working at One Avighna Park as a security guard around five years ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-security-guard-from-prayagraj-falls-to-death-from-19th-floor-on-to-first-fire-engine-that-arrived-on-site/articleshow/87213695.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court pulls up Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation for poor roads||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday once again pulled up the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation for the poor condition of roads and directed the municipal commissioner to file an affidavit stating what ‘concrete actions’ have been taken since the HC issued a slew of directions for proper maintenance of roads, elimination of the stray cattle menace and maintaining smooth traffic movements. The court also ordered the highest officer of city traffic police to reply on action taken to improve traffic conditions. The court asked what action has been taken about vehicles parked on roads and in no-parking zones. The court was told that the state government has approved the AMC’s traffic policy and action will soon be taken to implement it. The hearing was on a contempt petition filed for non-implementation of HC orders issued in 2018 on the basis of a PIL complaining about potholed city roads after the 2017 monsoon. The petitioner’s advocate, Amit Panchal, termed the AMC’s claims ‘eyewash’ and complained that the stray cattle menace and traffic problems persist. He submitted that it is not only about the implementation of court orders, but the duty of officials and once they fail to perform their duty, the civic body should return taxes for last three years to citizens. The bench headed by Justice A J Desai posed various questions to the civic authorities. It asked whether AMC officials are happy with road conditions and what is going on in the city of Ahmedabad. The judges said that the work should reflect on the road and not on paper alone. The court asked about measures undertaken to stop haphazard parking under the metro rail line and near its pillars across the city, which make driving on these roads difficult. The court asked about the poor condition of roads along the metro route and when the AMC said that repairing those roads is the metro rail company’s responsibility, the court asked for action against the officers responsible in the company for the bad roads. The court also asked when the civic body would complete the inquiry initiated against its employees for negligence over broken roads in 2017. When the AMC furnished information about damaged roads, the judges remarked, “60% of your roads are in bad condition.” The court sought a reply from the authorities on November 22.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-pulls-up-amc-for-poor-roads/articleshow/87213689.cms||---

On Friday, when a fire broke out in the flat, he was not home, but his wife and two children were. He rushed back when he got a call about the fire, but his family had managed to run out in time. He remembers the sprinklers inside were not working, not even two hours after the fire broke out. “We had just moved in three weeks ago. There was no construction work going on inside the flat. The sprinklers inside the flat were not working for a long time. Luckily my family rushed out and all are safe. We have no idea what might have caused the fire,” said Rathod. Other residents also complained that the firefighting system did not work as expected. They alleged that the maintenance of the building was the developer’s responsibility as he had not yet handed over the building to the housing society. Instead, they had got a stay on the society from the registrar of societies. Jeetu Jain, resident of the A wing, said: “I have been living here for four years now but still the builder has not handed over management of the building to the society. We have formed a society but so far no secretary or chairperson has been elected since the builder has got a stay on the appointment of the office bearers.” He added: “There are issues with the Occupation Certificate (OC) of the building too. The entire building was managed by the developer and the society had no say. So it was the responsibility of the builder to ensure that the firefighting system of the building was in operational condition. After seeing the smoke and hearing about the fire, we all rushed down.” The developer, Ms Nish Developers, said they had carried out a fire mock drill at the building as recently as October 1. The builder had appointed Jaibharat Enterprises for managing fire safety and systems in the twin towers. “We have given a live demo on how to operate extinguishers. Residents, housekeeping members and security guards were involved in this drill. They were also shown to operate rubber hose reel drum and hydrant point. They were also told how to evacuate and gather on the refuge floor. The drill was done successfully and the fire hydrant and sprinklers were found in working condition,” a letter from Jaibharat Enterprises said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sprinklers-didnt-switch-on-after-alarm-fume-residents/articleshow/87213725.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The shelter home run by Mother Theresa’s missionaries of charity has 55 inmates, most of them sick, bedridden and homeless. Sreedharan said that for the first time in India's history, the Goa governor’s office is being utilised to work for the poor and downtrodden people, extending financial assistance to them. He extended financial assistance for the care of the inmates and also separately to three dialysis patients. Deputy chief minister and Quepem MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar and South Goa Collector Ruchika Katyal were also present during the occasion. “The governor's office has a special fund which can be used for many purposes, but after I took over charge, God has shown me the way to utilise those entire funds to the needy people of Goa, mostly charitable institutions which are looking after orphans and aged people,” Sreedharan said. Sreedharan further said that earlier not a single governor had utilized these funds for poor people. The funds can be used for different purposes but the government and ministers take care of the public, but he assured that during his tenure, these funds will be used for only needy people, irrespective of caste, creed. religion and politics. I will talk less but work more for the poor people by visiting every home for the aged and distribute funds equally to such institutions. This is his second visit to missionaries of charity home in Quepem after Fatorpa, which is also run by St Teresa's instiuttion. Sreedharan has requested Kavlekar to make special arrangement to bring some healthy inmates at Raj Bhavan for a tour so that their mind will be fresh since they are staying at only one place for long time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/guv-proposes-raj-bhavan-tour-for-quepem-destitutes/articleshow/87214417.cms||---

A shopkeeper who runs a store in the vicinity of the cave-in said that on Friday afternoon, a jet patcher of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation arrived and repaired and resurfaced the hole. The shopkeeper, however, was of the opinion that the work done was superficial, as no detailed investigation was carried out by the civic body to learn how the issue had developed. Rather, it was a knee-jerk reaction to the news report, “70 sq ft barricade installed for month-old 70- sq inch pit” TOI had carried. “We are worried that the patchwork, may allow the fault to progress causing a major cave-in,” said the shopkeeper. He said it is almost like a sinkhole as the area around the hole had started capsizing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/finally-70-sq-inch-cave-in-patched/articleshow/87213702.cms||---

An order passed by police commissioner Rakesh Asthana said there would be two joint commissioners under a special commissioner, along with six additional commissioners. The joint commissioners would supervise the functioning of 15 deputy commissioners whose jurisdiction would be similar to district DCPs. There would be 67 traffic inspectors on a par with sub-divisional ACPs. The inspectors would be under immediate supervision of the ACPs. The special commissioner (traffic management division) would supervise the overall functioning of the unit. “Internal arrangements for administrative and key functions shall be made by the special commissioner with due consultations,” said the order. Asthana said, “We are putting in place a restructured traffic management system in view of the growing traffic needs of people and to make regulation and management smoother and more efficient to reduce inconvenience to the public due to the increasing traffic load. There will be enhanced focus on road safety, road engineering and citizen service.” Delhi Police said for the past many years, the focus has been on induction of technology for free flow of traffic and enforcement of regulations. These include red light violation detection system, over speed violation detection system, tripod-mounted portable speed radar guns, body-worn cameras, e-challan machines, interceptor, etc. “Due to the limited road infrastructure, traffic regulation during peak hours has remained a major challenge before Delhi Traffic Police. Restructuring of systems and manpower of Delhi traffic unit is the need of the hour,” said police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/recast-of-city-traffic-police-15-areas-to-be-manned-by-dcps/articleshow/87213710.cms||---

The state government made it clear that all the employees should be available in their respective offices on all the five working days. The government said that the staffers including those working on contract-basis should authenticate their attendance through bio-metric devises by 10 am and also after 5.30 pm. “Full-day attendance will be considered only when the employees authenticated the attendance in both the schedules,” said Revu Mutyala Raju, secretary (GAD) in a memo issued to the employees. He said that only three exceptions in a month will be allowed as per the secretariat working manual. He said that it would be treated as absent if anyone marked their attendance after 10.10 am. Since the five-day working schedule has been extended till June, 2022, the employees should work from 10 am to 5.30 pm on all working days. He said that bio-metric attendance is being re-introduced keeping in view of the containment of Covid-19 spread. The state government exempted employees from using bio-metric devises as part of Covid-19 containment measures during the second wave. Ten employees including three assistant secretary rank officers died after getting infected with Covid-19 between April and May. The staffers in the secretariat were jittery to attend to duties as many close contacts of the deceased employees were also infected. The government had allowed all positive tested employees to take leave till their recovery. Recently, the state government had extended transit accommodation facility till April, 2022. Although, the government wanted to end free accommodation from October, 2021, the chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy agreed to extend the facility by another six months following a request made by Secretariat Employees Federation president, K Venkatrami Reddy. Similarly, the state government had decided to renew the term of contract employees by another six months. The contract employees’ tenure will be extended till March, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/bio-metric-system-resumes-at-secretariat/articleshow/87213705.cms||Samdani MN

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Hit by rain, veggie prices reach for the sky||PUNE: The delayed withdrawal of the monsoon from the state in October has had a ripple effect on the price of vegetables, which increased by 100% in the retail market. Officials from the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Gultekdi said the situation was likely to continue for two more weeks. APMC chief administrator Madhukant Garad said the market was getting around 25-30% lower stocks than the daily average. “This caused the prices of all vegetables to double in 10 days. On Friday, we got around 1,200 vehicles of vegetables as against the average of 1,600 vehicles,” Garad said. “We expect this situation to continue for the next two weeks. Whenever the prices are high, we get intake from neighbouring states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka. But that is not the case this time,” Garad added. Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section at Gultekdi market yard, said, “A bunch of coriander is selling for Rs60-80, while other leafy greens like dill, fenugreek and spinach are selling for more than Rs50 a bunch. Other kitchen staples like cauliflower, cabbage, brinjal, and capsicum cost over Rs100 per kg.” Software professional Deepak Sharma from Moshi said vegetables were of lower quality and higher price. “Usually, vegetables costing Rs 350 last 10 days. This time, I shelled out Rs 600 for just half the usual quantity,” he said. Gayatri Mishra, another working professional, said, “If these rates persist, then we will have to curtail expenses for Diwali.” Neha Kale from Kothrud said, “Often, prices are beyond our budget. Because of this, the rates of food items have gone up in restaurants and eateries at many places.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hit-by-rain-veggie-prices-reach-for-the-sky/articleshow/87213739.cms||Sandip Dighe

Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the corporation’s contractual teachers were paid through a salary corpus in which Central government provided a third of the salary and Delhi government gave two-thirds of the funds. “At the peak of the first Covid crisis in May 2020, Delhi government stopped paying its share of contractual teachers' salary after which in June 2020, the MCDs discontinued their services as they were not in position to pay their salaries,” Kapoor said.

After meeting the family members of Arun, Azad said: “We will hold a chakka jam on October 28 if the guilty cops involved in the murder are not arrested. Injustice with dalit will not be tolerated. It’s surprising that the police have registered an FIR against unidentified cops, despite knowing of the involvement of the interrogation team.” Raising questions over the compensation amount of Rs 10 lakh announced for Valmiki’s family, Azad cited the cases of Apple executive Vivek Tewari and businessman Manish Gupta, saying that when the former was shot dead by a cop and the latter died during a police raid, the government provided Rs 40-lakh compensation along with a government job of OSD to their kin. “This is the discrimination by the government against dalit,” he said. Tewari was shot dead by a UP police constable in Lucknow in 2018 and Kanpur-based businessman Manish Gupta had died during a police raid at his hotel in Gorakhpur last month. Azad called for the resignation of the chief minister if he fails to protect the people of his state. “It is not surprising that the state police killed a dalit man and failed to take any action against a minister whose son mowed down farmers under his vehicle in Lakhimpur Kheri,” he said. He also assured assistance to Valmiki’s family.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/azad-seeks-cbi-probe-into-custodial-death-of-dalit-worker/articleshow/87212946.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Firefighting setup must for tall buildings as ladders may fall short||MUMBAI: The blaze at One Avighna Park clearly brings to fore the need for the highrises mushrooming in the city to have their own robust firefighting systems in place. Fire officials TOI that even though their 90m and 55m turntable ladders helped douse the flames on the 19th floor of the luxury residential highrise, the strong wind blowing from all directions made it difficult for the equipment to work to their full capacity. Hence, it is crucial that all highrises —especially 30 floors and above—ensure that their firefighting systems are in place and in working condition. TimesViewFire safety in Mumbai's high-rises has been a serious issue for some time now. Buildings have grown taller, but fire safety continues to be compromised at multiple levels. Fire safety norms remain on paper but in reality they are violated and firefighting equipment is not found to be functional after almost every such tragedy. While the BMC must ensure safety norms are complied with, strict and visible action must be taken against violators, including builders and residents. Housing societies too must ensure all fire safety norms are followed and firefighting equipment is in working condition.“The 90m hydraulic platform, currently the tallest in the force that can reach up to 30 floors, was rushed to the site, but the wind speed was so strong that it could be used to control the flames only to some extent,” a senior fire official said. He added that the highrise’s firefighting system, once made operational, helped control the blaze to a large extent. Nishant Agarwal, managing director of Avighna Group, said they encourage regular fire drills. “One may have the best fire safety equipment, but it is important that residents are able to use it as well,” he told TOI. “I have seen videos of even the fire brigade ladders able to spray water only to a certain extent, hence it brings up the issue of having one’s own well-equipped system in place.”  The society had an awareness session followed by an evacuation drill on handling domestic emergencies, firefighting training and use of firefighting equipment on October 1. Sudhir Badami, a civil engineer from IIT-B, said that an exit plan is of utmost importance in all buildings, especially highrises. “But in the One Avighna Park fire, it is surprising that the security guard, who died, did not follow the exit plan,” he said. Under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006, it is the responsibility of the property’s owner or the cooperative housing society to follow fire safety norms and submit an audit report, signed by a licensed fire expert, every six months certifying compliance to the chief fire officer. If there is no owner or society, the occupants will have to do it, the Act states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-firefighting-setup-must-for-tall-bldgs-as-ladders-may-fall-short/articleshow/87213744.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Delhi||Delhi court rejects Sharjeel Imam's bail plea, says tone of his speech could hurt peace||NEW DELHI: The bail plea of JNU student Sharjeel Imam was dismissed on Friday with a city court saying that the tone and tenor of incendiary speech tend to have a debilitating effect upon public tranquility, peace and harmony of the society. Imam was arrested for allegedly giving a seditious speech that resulted in violence during the anti-CAA protests in New Friends Colony in December 2019. However, the court said the evidence in support of the allegations that rioters got instigated by Imam’s speech to indulge in rioting, attacking police, etc, at several places were “scanty and sketchy”. The prosecution claimed that Imam had delivered provocative speeches on December 13 and 15, 2019 and January 16, 2020. The case in which Imam’s bail plea was dismissed pertained to the speech delivered by him on December 13, 2019, which allegedly instigated a particular religious community against the government by creating unfounded fears in their minds regarding CAB and NRC. Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Agrawal said, “Neither any eyewitness has been cited by the prosecution nor is there any other evidence on record to suggest that the co-accused got instigated and committed rioting, etc upon hearing Imam’s speech. There is no evidence corroborating the version of prosecution that the alleged rioters/co-accused were a part of the audience addressed by Imam on that day.” The court further said the essential link between the speech and the subsequent acts of the co-accused was “conspicuously missing”. “The theory as propounded by police left gaping holes, which leaves an incomplete picture unless the gaps were filled by resorting to surmises and conjectures or by essentially replying upon the disclosure statement of Iman and the co-accused,” said the order. “It is not legally permissible to build the edifice of the prosecution version upon the foundation of imagination or upon inadmissible confession before a police officer. Once the legally impermissible foundation of imaginative thinking and disclosure statement of accused/co-accused is removed, the prosecution version on this count appears to be crumbling like a house of cards,” said the court. Though the Special Public Prosecutor argued that the disclosure statements were relevant under Section 8 of Indian Evidence Act, it appeared to be nothing but a “desperate attempt” on his part to save the day for the prosecution, it was observed. However, the court said it was not required to enter into a meticulous examination of the material placed on record by the prosecution at this stage to unnecessarily prejudice the case. The judge concluded that the facts and circumstances and considering the contents of that speech that tended to have a debilitating effect on the communal peace and harmony, he was not inclined to grant bail to Imam at this stage. Interestingly, the court quoted Swami Vivekananda: “We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think; Words are secondary; Thoughts live; they travel far”. It further stated the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression had been placed upon a very high pedestal in the Constitution and its essence was well captured in the statement of Milton who said, “Give me the liberty to know, to argue freely, and to utter according to conscience, above all liberties”. However, the very same Constitution places reasonable restriction upon exercise of the said right on the grounds of public order and incitement to offence. Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Imam, argued that he did not participate in the violence during any protest or demonstration as he was a peace loving and law-abiding citizen. No speech delivered by him aimed at spreading any disaffection against the government or inciting violence or ill-will against any community.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-rejects-sharjeel-bail-plea-says-tone-of-his-speech-could-hurt-peace/articleshow/87213750.cms||Usha Das

On Friday, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) carried out pre-Diwali test of firecrackers in association with the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) at the latter’s campus in Gondkhairi. According to the Environment (Protection) Second Amendment Rules, 2006, the manufacture, sale or use of firecrackers generating noise levels exceeding the 125 decibels (dB(A)) at 4 metre distance from the point of bursting is prohibited. This year, the siren whistle from Shree Kaleshwar Fire Works, Shivakashi, was found to be the loudest at 122.4 dB(A). “The other firecrackers' noise levels were found in the range of 107 dB(A) to 66 dB(A),” said MPCB sub-regional officer AN Katole. Nearly 40 brands of sound-emitting crackers were tested. Samples were collected from local markets. PESO officials, including the controller of explosives SP Sangole, were also present during noise monitoring. They have appealed to the citizens to check the decibel levels before buying. Also, sellers of firecrackers must follow the safety advisory issued by PESO. In 2014, most of the crackers tested by the board were found to exceed the permissible noise limit. However, things have reportedly improved in the last few years. The safe limit was brought into implementation taking into consideration the health ailments that exposure to high level of noise can cause.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/firecrackers-within-allowed-sound-limit/articleshow/87212956.cms||Manka Behl

Forest department officials immediatelyrushed to the spot and assured Pingale of appropriate compensation. Since the last three to four months, villagers have reported tiger sightings in the forested area of Surla. The Pingale family itself has lost buffaloes in earlier attacks. “Our staff already visited the spot, along with a veterinary doctor. We will conduct the postmortem and take immediate steps for providing necessary compensation to the affected family. On earlier occasions too, the department has compensated the Pingale family for the losses,” Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, range forest officer, Deepak Tandel told TOI. Increasing deforestation in Sattari, diversion of heavy traffic through the Chorla ghat connecting Belagavi and Panaji, as well as paucity of herbivore animals due to inadequate availability of food and fodder, has forced tigers to rely on domesticated animals as a food source.Deputy conservator of forest, wildlife, Jebestin Arulraj said, “We have already taken necessary steps for monitoring the movement of tigers in the area through camera traps as well as increased manpower for patrolling. A watch tower has been erected to keep an eye on tigers and other wild animals.” Meanwhile, keeping in mind the human safety factor, wildlifer Gajanan Shetye opined that the forest department should take necessary steps to curtail picnickers visiting the waterfalls in the core area where tiger movements have been repeatedly recorded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tiger-kills-cow-at-surla-family-assured-aid/articleshow/87214438.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Acting on a complaint filed by his mother, Alka, who told the police that her son disappeared leaving a note behind at home, cops swung into action and found Aakash Ambasana along with his former wife on a high under the influence of drugs. Even earlier in June, the mother had submitted an application with the police alleging her son to have become a substance abuser and also named a few peddlers who were providing him with the contraband. Thereafter, police raided several peddlers but arrested only one woman in July. In the meantime, Aakash went to Delhi to live with his father and had returned to Rajkot only on October 12. According to the mother, Aakash left home on Thursday evening leaving behind a note stating: “I am leaving home, mom. I can’t fulfil your dreams, please forgive me.” Cops once again raided several drug peddlers and found him with his former wife Ami Cholera (22) in Shiv Shakti hotel of the racecourse. Ami had become addicted to drugs after marrying Akash, but drugs also made them quarrel and ultimately led to their divorce. However, the estranged couple often met for dose of drugs, said the police. Cops also found a drug peddler from the hotel, Irfan Patni (43), and seized three injections of MD drugs from him. One was empty, another half and the third one was intact. Talking to media persons, deputy commissioner of police Manoharsinh Jadeja said, “We have taken blood samples of all the three persons and sent the injections for forensic test. Based on the result we will register an offence.” According to sources the police also detained three other drug peddlers in this connection, while Aakash had borrowed from money lenders to buy drugs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/struggling-cricketer-former-wife-found-intoxicated-in-rajkot-hotel/articleshow/87213079.cms||---

On Thursday, Kushwaha along with two junior advocates reached Manish’s Barra residence and sought details about the incident point-wise from his kin, including his widow Meenakshi and other family members. While briefing the reporters, Kushwaha said that as soon as the chargesheet is filed, she will submit a ‘vakalatnama’ in the court. Meenakshi told TOI that to get justice for her husband, a panel of five advocates including Kushwaha, who was an advocate of Nirbhaya case, will fight her case. Meenakshi said that she is apprehensive that the accused policemen will use all their might to influence the case in their favour. “I have full faith in the panel. If I had fought the case alone, perhaps an attempt would have been made to influence the case. Now, the guilty policemen would not be able to succeed in their nefarious plans and won’t be able to influence the panel,” she added. Advocate Kushwaha reached Manish’s house with her two junior colleagues at around 7:45 pm on Thursday. She talked to Meenakshi and went through the entire incident from the beginning till date in about 17 pages, she took each and every minute detail of the whole incident. During this, she was also apprised by Meenakshi about her husband’s last call from the hotel to his nephew Durgesh on the night the incident occurred. At the same time, the advocate also took footage of the CCTV cameras of the hotel, a copy of the post-mortem report, the details of hospitals where Manish was taken and of the hospital from where the death certificate of Manish was issued. Kushwaha also inquired Meenakshi about what time did they come to know about the incident. Besides, whom did she contact after getting the information. She gathered detail with regard to items of Manish that have not yet been found like his bracelet, ring, chain and cash, etc. at the same time, she inquired about the statements of the eyewitnesses of the incident, their presence and the story. Kushwaha told the reporters that they were trying to ascertain whether the chief minister has made only an oral recommendation for the CBI probe or has also sent a sanction letter to the concerned ministry. She said, “Advocate KK Shukla has filed a PIL for CBI investigation in the Supreme Court and he is our associate lawyer. Once the police file the chargesheet, I will sign the ‘vakalatnama’ and file it in court.” She further said that after the listing of the case, the date of hearing will be given. She also said that she had tweeted Chief Minister Yogi Adityanathji from her Twitter handle on October 18. “I request you to order a CBI inquiry into Manish’s murder case.

The counsellor was surprised to know that the woman had 17 years of married life. “The woman said that she fell in love with a youth. He had promised to marry her and had told her that she must get separated from her family. Thus, she forced her husband to give her a divorce. She created a ruckus and also got the documents. When she approached her boyfriend two days ago, she was sent back saying that his family was against the union and accepting a married woman,” said a counsellor. It shocked the woman who had left everything for love, they said. Realizing her folly, she went back to her husband, pleading him to accept her again. “Angry with her behaviour and with the fact that she had an extramarital affair, he also refused to accept her and said that they cannot live together. As a last resort, she approached her parents. They also refused to accept her,” said the counsellor. Under severe depression, the woman approached the helpline. The counsellors sent her to one-stop centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/woman-calls-181-after-both-lover-ex-husband-refuse-to-take-her-in/articleshow/87213767.cms||---

She said her husband is unemployed and the family is suffering from financial crisis. In her complaint, the woman said that her husband was an autorickshaw driver and for past many days, he was not working anywhere. Around two months ago, the woman asked for some money to pay school fees of their two children, but the man began abusing her and became angry. When she told her to go out and find some job, he became more aggressive and uttered “talaq” (divorce) for three times. She said that he had left home then and returned on Friday but thrashed her again. She said that when he was thrashing her, she called for help and some neighbours rushed there and rescued her. She then called up police control room and filed a complaint under the domestic violence act and the Muslim women (protection of rights on marriage) bill, 2017.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/asked-to-find-job-man-gives-triple-talaq-to-wife/articleshow/87213756.cms||---

The district administration has recommended a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased. Reports said the deceased, Bhogi Pal of Nayagaon village in Birdha block of the district, had come to the district headquarters on Friday to buy manure. He went to a shop in Jugpura area, where suddenly his health condition deteriorated and he collapsed in the queue. Bhogi was taken to the district hospital where he was declared brought dead. Senior administrative officers, including DM Lalitpur, Unnavi Dinesh Kumar rushed to the hospital to handle the situation. As per the deceased farmer’s son Kripal Pal, his father had two acres of land for which he was trying to get manure for the past three days. He had to repeatedly stand in queues at several shops due to short supply. Talking to TOI, Lalitpur DM said, “The body of the deceased farmer has been handed over to his family members after postmortem. The postmortem report says he died of a heart attack. Arrangements for his funeral have been made. I have recommended a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family members of the deceased under the state welfare scheme.” He further informed TOI that due to the sudden rainfall last week, the sowing of seeds has been preponed. “This has suddenly escalated the demand of DAP and urea many-fold. Last October, the demand of manure was 20,000 MT which has just doubled this year as farmers are in a rush to procure it. This has suddenly created an imbalance in demand and supply, which will be sorted out soon.” Samajwadi Party (SP) national president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has criticised the government regarding the incident on social media, saying that “the shortage of manure in BJP government has taken a very ugly turn. In independent India, farmers have never faced so much trouble and humiliation before.” Farmer bodies have been agitating in various parts of Bundelkhand for the past few days against the short supply of manure, alleging that shopkeepers were selling DAP and urea ion premium. Farmer leader Shiv Narayan Singh Parihar said, “The official rate of urea and DAP per bag is Rs 1,200 but farmers are paying somewhere between 1,300-1,500 per bag because of short supply.” Commissioner Jhansi division Ajay Shankar Pandey has ordered strict vigilance in all the three districts of the division, including Jhansi, Jalaun and Lalitpur. He has called for sealing of district borders in order to stop inter-district selling of manure. The commissioner has also asked the officers to check each and every shop for illegal activity. The commissioner informed TOI, “There is enough stock of urea and DAP in the division. Farmers should not get restless as the requirement of all will be fulfilled in the coming days.” Optional Trim On Friday, the administration raided 32 shops in Lalitpur and took samples from four and issued show cause notices to two persons. Moreover, FIRs were filed against three shop-owners. Similarly in Jhansi, 35 shops were inspected while samples were collected from 11 shops and notices were issued to two shops. In Jalaun, 40 shops were raided in which samples were collected from 10 shops while notices were issued to four shops.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/standing-in-queue-to-buy-manure-lalitpur-farmer-dies-of-heart-attack/articleshow/87214450.cms||---

They run the ‘restaurant on wheel’ at Thampanoor bus terminal; the second such initiative of Kudumbasree mission. “This venture has become a great relief for us. This will encourage other women like us to come up with innovative ideas like this. We are getting a good response and acceptance from people, especially from KSRTC employees,” said Priya Harikrishnan, an employee. The new restaurant aims to provide traditional, homely and healthy food to the public. The programme was developed to increase Kudumbashree’s presence in the city’s food business and also aims at women empowerment by including Kudumbashree workers to improve their financial status. The dining area was shaped out of a defunct KSRTC bus and the renovation of the bus was done by the catering unit. It was then painted and the seats were arranged for dining in. The budget for these came to around Rs 2 lakhs. The bus can accommodate around 20 people at a time. The KSRTC employees will receive the food in a discount rate. Steamed food is the main attraction. Apart from steamed food, packed lunches with fish and chicken, snacks, fresh juices and shakes are also available at a fair price. The restaurant will work daily from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm. The restaurant on wheels was inaugurated by the transport minister Antony Raju on Monday. Earlier, Kudumbashree's first restaurant, ‘pink café’ was launched at East Fort. “The pandemic has affected our lives badly. So this new unit gives me the opportunity to get back to work. This has a therapeutic effect, I feel better and happy,” says Reji Mol S, an employee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/food-on-wheels-gets-them-back-on-track/articleshow/87213789.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Raids on cycle units continue, dept tight-lipped on reason||Ludhiana: The income tax raids on several bicycle companies of the city continued on Friday as well. Different teams of the department stayed inside the factories in Industrial Estate, Focal Point, Phase 4, Kanganwal and Dhandari Kalan. The investigation wing of the income tax department is still silent on why the raids were conducted and whether or not anything pointing at tax evasion has been recovered till now. Sources, however, said the officials were still going through the accounts, documents, banking transactions, property papers, among others, and even physically checking the stocks of these firms to detect discrepancies. The raids have caused huge resentment among industrialists, who are calling this action unnecessary. Speaking to the TOI, a prominent cycle industrialist said, “These raids have sent shockwaves in the cycle industry as the raided firms include some reputed medium-scale enterprises, which only do genuine business dealings. And some raided firms do not have such big business that requires raids. Such is their reputation that people can’t believe that these companies can indulge in tax evasion or any other malpractice.”Another businessman said, “The industry had just started getting out of the recession after a long time, and this I-T action has created fear among businessmen. Since Thursday, several factories and shops dealing with the raided firms or located near them have suspended their operations.”Meanwhile, different theories on why the action was taken against so many firms of the same industry segment are doing rounds in the city. Some said I-T action was taken on the complaint of bigger companies that felt threatened by the increasing competition from medium and small-scale firms. Others said these firms were raided because they participate in government tenders for purchase of bicycles. But upon confirmation from different sources, it emerged that only two of these firms take part in tendering.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/raids-on-cycle-units-continue-dept-tight-lipped-on-reason/articleshow/87212973.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Delhi||Fresh as a daisy: NDMC plans a bright welcome for winter||NEW DELHI: Come winter and Central Park in Connaught Place, Barakhamba Road, Mandi House, the Windsor Place roundabout, Talkatora and some other areas will be sporting a colourful, new look. New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has chalked out plans for flowering and decorative foliage at these places. “These are busy areas and stretches unlike Lutyens’ Delhi and planting flowering plants there will be a challenge due to heavy use of the roads,” admitted S. Chelliah, director, horticulture, NDMC. NDMC will use round 25cm pots fitted with geotextile fabric and edging sheets on the Barakhamba Road central verge. “We will plant salvia, petunia and marigold in different colours here by the end of November. The verge is barely two metres wide so we have to be cautious about the plants not being damaged by people crossing the stretch,” said Chellaiah. At Central Park in Connaught Place, at least 17,000 flowering pots with tulips in different colours will be placed by November-end around the amphitheatre to improve the look of this place. “Tulips will be planned along the fountain and will later be replaced with seasonal flowers. Also, to give a rainbow look to the space around the amphitheatre, thousands of pots of flowering antirrhinum, dianthus, pansy, petunia and other plants will be placed there,” said an NDMC official. The civic body is in the process of awarding the contract for the import of 80,000 tulip bulbs in 10 different colours (mostly dark and single shades). Chellaiah said the tulips to be planted at Central Park would be in addition to the tendered quantity and no light colour or multicolour shades would be accepted this year. At places like the Windsor Place roundabout opposite Le Meridien hotel, landscaping work has started and heart shaped frames are being installed. “Eight heart-shaped frames have been put up on which red petunia will be planted from November onwards. Later foliage will be planted to cover the frames and give them an aesthetic look,” said the civic official. At Mandi House roundabout too, the plan is to transplant phoenix palms and improve the appearance of the busy traffic point by planting decorative plants of short height and colourful blooms. “While the preparation is going on at nurseries to grow flowering plants from hybrid imported seeds to meet the huge requirement in peak season, we are also planning to buy seedlings if required,” said the official. At Talkatora Garden, where the trimmed carpet look consisting of straight columns of hybrid petunia, dahlia and salvia along the fountains is well appreciated by visitors every year, the municipal council this time is changing geometry and opting for a zigzag look for its flowering plants. “To highlight these geometrical patterns, we will make sure that the height of the plants will remain the same,” disclosed the official. At Tikona Park opposite the residence of the Indian vice-president, a glorious bunching of petunia, antirrhinum, dianthus, pansy and larkspur will be planted with the luxuriantly green grass.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fresh-as-a-daisy-ndmc-plans-a-bright-welcome-for-winter/articleshow/87213776.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Mumbai||CISF apologises to Sudhaa Chandran for Mumbai airport prosthetics trouble||MUMBAI: Dancer and actor Sudhaa Chandran, an amputee, in a video statement posted on a social media platform, said she is made to remove her prosthetic limb to clear airport security every time. On Thursday, the 56-year-old accomplished Bharatnatyam dancer had reached the Mumbai airport to board a flight to Hyderabad when she was asked to remove her prosthetic limb to clear security, said an aviation source. In a video clip posted later, Chandran said: “Every time I go on my professional visits, each time I am stopped at the airport and when I request CISF security officers that please do an ETD (explosive trace detector) test for my artificial limb, they still want me to remove my artificial limb and show it to them.” She added it is “very disheartening and humiliating at times when I am told to show or remove my artificial limb”. Four years ago, India had amended security norms for disabled passengers, under which their prosthetics or wheelchairs are to be put through an X-ray check only on sufficient reason and justification. Chandran appealed to the Prime Minister to intervene and make airport security less of an ordeal for senior citizens. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the agency in charge of airport security, issued a public apology and stated under the existent security protocol, “prosthetics are to be removed for security checks only under exceptional circumstances”. The CISF tweeted: “We will examine why the lady personnel concerned requests Chandran to remove the prosthetics. We assure Chandran that all our personnel will be sensitised again on the protocols so that no inconvenience is caused to travelling passengers.” @abpmajhatv We will examine why the lady personnel concerned requested Ms. Sudhaa Chandran to remove the prosthetic… https://t.co/9FuZcXVyBm— CISF (@CISFHQrs) 1634886186000Nipun Malhotra, a wheelchair user, said: “In 2017, O P Singh, the then director-general CISF, had amended security screening protocol to bring dignity to wheelchair users. Since then, clearing airport security hasn’t been an ordeal. So I was sad to hear about Chandran’s experience.” Communications professional Antara Telang, an amputee, said: “I fly largely out of Mumbai and Bengaluru. My airport experience improved after the security norms were amended a few years ago. Not every security personnel is conversant with these amendments though, in which case, I inform them. Then their superior intervenes and they let me clear security without ordeal.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cisf-apologises-to-sudhaa-chandran-for-airport-prosthetics-trouble/articleshow/87213760.cms||Manju V

Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) SPS Dhindsa said, “The accused are drug addicts. They started committing snatchings and robberies to meet their drug needs. Shirja and Shivam already have criminal cases against them. They would roam around in different areas like Moti Nagar, Jamalpur, Division 7, Daresi and Focal Point in search of their targets.”Their bike had a forged registration number plate. “Even its RC is fake. It will be probed how they got it. They used the vehicle to execute the crimes. Usually, they would attack or threaten factory workers at night, robbing them of cash, cellphone and other valuables,” added Dhindsa. Shiraj and Shivam have two snatching cases against them. They were lodged in jail and came out on bail in February and March, respectively. After coming out, they again started executing the crime and roped in Gurdeep as well. All three are school dropouts. A case has been registered under sections 379-B (snatching), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 467 (forgery for valuable security, will etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal etc), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of dacoity) of the IPC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/7-snatching-cases-solved-with-arrest-of-3/articleshow/87212978.cms||---
---||Nagpur||At cinema halls near your house: Vacant seats||Nagpur: As expected, the Friday reopening attendance in cinema halls was extremely low but movie exhibitors are looking at this as a practice run for the Diwali weekend when a slew of new Hindi movies will be released. Sunday is likely to see some rush at the national level multiplex chain as they will screen the India-Pakistan match. One owner, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Yes, today we had just a couple of people coming but that was expected. There’s no new Hindi movie set for release. So, all cinema halls are screening Hindi movies which are already available on OTT.” The two English movies currently being screened in the city too did not set the cash registers ringing. “Please understand that the bulk of business happens from Hindi movies. So, till new big banner movies release there won’t be a heavy footfall in cinema halls,” he said.People who did show up for the ‘first day, first show’ definitely enjoyed the big screen. Shankar Gurmukhdas, a businessman, said, “I enjoyed watching the movie on the big screen after a long time. Despite the reduced crowd and people sitting on alternate seats, we miss the fans cheering and whistling.”Another businesswoman, Mangla K, said, “It has been seven months since the reopening of cinemas in the city. I haven’t been to a theatre since the first lockdown. Watching my favourite actor again on the big screen was a great experience.The Covid protocol is also being followed. However, one does miss the fun of sitting with your spouse because of alternate seating.”Atish Gupta, who works for a utility firm, said, “It’s a way to relax and since all protocols are being followed, I think it is safe to visit the theatres. I’m hesitant to bring my children along, but once they are vaccinated, it won't be an issue.” He also added that not allowing food inside, part of the government’s guidelines, was ‘dissapointing’. Gupta said, “Enjoying snacks and soft drinks are an integral part of the movie watching experience. So, I definitely missed that aspect this time around.” Ranjana Dhoke, who works for a private firm, said, “I’m ecstatic after watching the film. There was no crowd at all for the first show, but as the rush increases, theatres must strictly stick to the rules. People should only visit theatres that comply with the protocols.”Cinema hall owners are confident of crowds rushing back to the theatres from the Diwali week itself as there is a queue of big star movies ready to be released.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/at-cinema-halls-near-your-house-vacant-seats/articleshow/87211447.cms||---

Safety trials will be held on tracks once the rake is assembled. MahaMetro officials stated that technical teams had been deployed for the assembling work and conducting the checks on various parameters. This process would continue for a few days. The rake has been kept at the Vanaz depot for inspection and trials. A total of three rakes would be made available in the first phase, a MahaMetro official said, adding that these were lightweight trains and would save energy and require less maintenance. “We are expecting two more rakes soon. The new rakes will have to undergo various checks. We aim to complete the process at the earliest. The inspection is time-consuming as it involves detailed analysis on various parameters,” an official from MahaMetro said. A single aluminium rake can accommodate 970 passengers, while around 320 can travel in a single coach. The rake can run at a maximum speed of 90km per hour. The MahaMetro has placed an order with the Titagarh Firema company to supply 34 rakes. The rakes for the initial phase are being manufactured in Italy. The rest would be cast at the Kolkata-based manufacturing unit. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR) of MahaMetro, said, “All advanced features, including station announcements, air-conditioning, cellphone charging and display boards, would be available in every coach.” The rakes would have a provision to attach extra coaches, depending on the requirement. Currently, MahaMetro has procured rakes from the Nagpur Metro for the initial trials and operations. These rakes would continue to be in use till the new rakes complete the safety trials and checks. Construction of Pimpri & Kasarwadi stations in advanced stages The work on the Pimpri and Karasrwadi stations on the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-Range Hills elevated section is now in its advanced stages. The MahaMetro said the work of stations had been expedited on all the routes, including the underground stretch. Pimpri is the first station on the PCMC-Range Hills route.

---||Ludhiana||NGT: Ensure rainwater harvesting rules compliance||Ludhiana: Following a petition filed by the Council of Engineers, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the chief secretary of Punjab, principal secretary of local government department, PUDA, municipal corporation, Ludhiana Improvement Trust and Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada) to ensure strict compliance with Punjab Model Building Bylaws, 2018, for mandatory provisions of rainwater harvesting /recharge wells in private as well as public places.The NGT, in its order, stated that there was no denial of requirement of water harvesting systems to replenish groundwater and utilise every drop of water, necessary for survival of all beings and the nature. While disposing of the matter, the tribunal held that the statutory rules of Punjab acknowledge the requirement and implementation has to be ensured by the authorities along with the cooperation of citizens. The council president, Kapil Arora, said, “Glada, LIT and MC are collecting hefty money in the name of refundable security deposits at the time of approval of layout plans from private owners. However, the practice is limited to collection of funds only as rainwater harvesting system is not being installed by private owners and security gets forfeited. Besides, as per building bylaws, it is mandatory for development authorities to install recharge wells in their buildings as well as at public places, but the provisions are blatantly being ignored by all three authorities and funds collected by them as security deposits are being diverted for other works. Despite provision of formation of rainwater harvesting cell to ensure installation of the system by private buildings, no committee has been formed.”The council vice-president, Kulwant Singh Rai, said, “Ludhiana receives an average rainfall of 680mm in a year. If a 100 square metre building installs rooftop rainwater harvesting system, more than 50,000 litres of rainwater can be recharged to the ground. If the rainwater from roads and public places is collected properly and scientifically, it may cover up to 50% of standard domestic consumption of water in Ludhiana.”An MC official said, “We have sought permission from the finance and contracts committee for installation of rainwater harvesting system in our zonal offices. Gradually, these will be installed at other public places as well. The residents should also follow rules and get the system installed in their buildings.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ngt-ensure-rainwater-harvesting-rules-compliance/articleshow/87212987.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Two held from UP for duping firm by forging email IDs||JAIPUR: City police on Friday arrested two men from Lucknow who duped a city-based company by forging its email addresses and letterheads to fraudulently transfer Rs 49 lakh from bank accounts. DCP (crime), Amrita Duhan said that police had blocked Rs 28 lakh from transferring into the accused’s bank account as soon as the FIR was filed. The two accused were listed by police as Tausib Ahmad (23), and Kunal Gupta (28), both residents of Lucknow. “The accused made identical email addresses of the company to send emails to banks, seeking urgent transfer of money in different bank accounts. They specifically sent these emails around 5.30pm when banks were all set to close for the day,” Duhan told TOI. She said that the accused also attached the forged letterheads of the company in emails sent to different banks. The crime branch will also examine how major transactions were processed sans proper verifications. While police have not ruled out the possibility of alleged collusion, Duhan said investigation was underway to determine if banks contacted verified mobile numbers before sanctioning large amounts of transactions. This is probably a first-of-its-kind incident reported in Jaipur, where a leading company’s email and documents were mimicked by scammers to facilitate large amounts of money to funnel through different bank accounts. Police have also learnt that the accused moved from the company’s bank accounts and transferred them into other accounts in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. According to Duhan, the accused withdrew money in multiple tranches in different ways. One of the accused, Tausib, was earlier arrested by Shastri Nagar police in a similar scamming case. The crime branch leant that the accused had also duped a company under the Sanganer Sadar police station area and duped Rs 23 lakh. Duhan said that the accused were arrested from Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and investigation was underway to determine their connection in other digital heists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/2-held-from-up-for-duping-firm-by-forging-email-ids/articleshow/87214457.cms||---

The police arrived at the conclusions based on the opinion of the surgeon who performed the autopsy as well as other pieces of evidence collected during the investigation. Sajeev of Idukkumthala near Vattappara was found dead in a plantation near his residence on Thursday morning, a couple of hours after he went out for a morning walk. He had been working as a manager of a granite shop functioning in the city. The way in which his body lying with plastic zip ties fastened around neck, gave way for suspicion that he might have been murdered by strangulation. On Friday, a post mortem examination of the body was conducted. Following the examination, the surgeon told the investigation officer that the marks on his neck suggest that the deceased strangled himself. If someone else strangled him, it would have led to a struggle and this would in turn have resulted in injuries. The police have also recovered a note that Sajeev left behind in his cabin at his workplace. In the note it was written that he was done with this life. He has directed his family to pay off his debt of Rs 2.25 lakhs. Surveillance camera visuals recorded on Wednesday showed Sajeev writing the note and leaving it in his cabin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/police-conclude-granite-managers-death-as-suicide/articleshow/87213819.cms||---

It was attended by collector R Vimala and other officials from the collectorate associated with the elections process.Refuting charges labelled by Congress and other parties about EVM tampering, Deshpande said those cannot be connected with any device nor can be re-progammed. “The ECI had given an open challenge to anyone having doubts over functioning of EVMs. Even Supreme Court had held that the machines are full-proof for voting,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/eci-experimenting-with-online-voting/articleshow/87211467.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai police seized heroin but no one spoke as there was no heroine, says CM Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday criticised the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), saying an impression is being created as if Maharashtra has become the hub of narcotics. “An impression is being created as if there is a wave of drug trafficking in Maharashtra, as if drugs from all over the world are produced in Maharashtra, and only a special team can disrupt the racket. But that is not true,” said Thackeray, speaking virtually at the inauguration of the first wildlife DNA testing lab in Nagpur and three fast-track DNA testing units under the Nirbhaya scheme to test human DNA samples in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur forensic labs. Thackeray said he is proud of Maharashtra and Mumbai police for their efforts at keeping the drug menace in check. “A few days ago, Mumbai police caught heroin worth Rs 25 crore, but because there was no heroine involved in it, no one spoke about it. No one knows the names of those policemen. We should felicitate them,” Thackeray said. He said the Maharashtra police is a strong, competent force, and strict action is taken against anyone who violates the law, without any leniency shown. “Attempts are being made to tarnish this image of the Maharashtra police, and we have to stop these attempts,” said Thackeray. The NCB has arrested several people, including actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan, in a drug bust case. Meanwhile, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil said the state government is likely to table the final draft of the Shakti Act which prescribes stringent punishment for crimes against women and children in the upcoming winter session of the legislature in December. Thackeray said that while the state wants to give stringent punishment for crimes against women and children, cases fall through many times for want of evidence, and the DNA testing units will help the state with robust evidence so that strict punishments can be awarded. He said the wildlife DNA testing lab in Nagpur will help in dealing with cases of animal poaching. “We want the state police to be equipped with the latest technology to be one step ahead of the criminal,” he said.

Though the attendance was muted with Friday being a weekday, the excitement was clearly visible among the audience. Anagha Ghodkhande, an entrepreneur, said, “After the lockdown, it is for the first time that I’m attending a programme like this. I'm quite happy and I feel more shows like this should be organized so that people can come and enjoy. Also, the halls are good in size and I feel that now we can enjoy without the fear of Covid.”Sachine Mulmule, an entrepreneur, said, “I used to attend such programmes earlier and we missed such moments. I feel we should continue with more such shows because now people are aware and are cautious. People were missing all this and if they want to enjoy then they will follow the guidelines.” Suresh Dorle, a retired government employee, said, “Due to the lockdown we really missed theatres a lot and I’m very thankful to the state government for taking this initiative. Moreover, music is a therapy which refreshes our mind. It has been playing a vital role in our lives.”Dinesh Bagdi, a retired government employee, said, “Felt very nice that theatres have been restarted in Nagpur. It is the only timepass for senior citizens and therefore, we come here for entertainment and take home beautiful memories.” Haribhau Paunikar, a businessman, said, “It’s really nice to know that things are getting back to normal and people are gathering just like the old days. New programmes are being organized. We missed such events. These theatres provide a good platform to young artistes to showcase their talent. I would like to appreciate their efforts and zeal to keep the theatre trend alive.” Artistes feel the reopening has happened ‘pretty late’. Many of them went through a tough time during the lockdown. Abhijit Athavle, an artiste, said, “We were badly affected due to the lockdown. As many theatre groups were closed, our financial condition worsened.” Another artiste, Rupesh Pawar, said, “The reopening should have happened earlier. Our craft refreshes the mind. It should be recognized and promoted. It feels good to cater to the audience after a long gap. I hope things become better.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/artistes-back-on-stage-as-theatres-reopen/articleshow/87211460.cms||---

Raut said, “The final amount of the robbed loot has been assessed at Rs1.88 crore. Six employees, including a bank manager, were on duty. The suspects robbed the bank in a well-planned manner due to lack of security arrangements at the branch and fled in the direction of Ahmednagar.” “The rural police has spread out 10 teams at various places. We are working on certain clues and hope to detect the dacoity case at the earliest,” he said while refusing to divulge more details on the ground that investigations were in progress.

---||Vijayawada||Ruling party MPs to seek ban on TDP||AMARAVATI: A delegation of YSRC MPs will meet the Election Commission of India (ECI) next week to seek ban on TDP. The party MPs have already sought an appointment with chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners. The delegation will meet the CEC and other commissioners either on Monday or Tuesday, said the state government advisor and YSRC general secretary Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. Addressing Janagraha Deeksha organized by the party legislators and leaders in Guntur on Friday, Sajjala said that TDP has lost its right to continue as political party. He said that they would request the ECI to scrutinize the speeches of TDP leaders even when there was no model code of conduct. He said that normally ECI would look into the public addresses of the leaders when it enforces the model code of conduct. However, ECI is empowered to censure any political party that violates the guidelines prescribed by the commission. The YSRC general secretary found fault with TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu for not repenting on the comments made by his party leader Pattabhi against the chief minister. He rubbished the talk of TDP leaders that the attack on the TDP office was pre-meditated. He said that a few angry followers of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy attacked the TDP office as they were unable to digest the comments made against their leader. “The situation would have been a different one had we really planned it. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is completely against such undemocratic approach,” said Sajjala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ruling-party-mps-to-seek-ban-on-tdp/articleshow/87213790.cms||Samdani MN

Sources said that the firm is under pressure to deliver e-buses to Pune and Mumbai cities that have placed bigger orders. Delivery of the first lot of 25 buses – as per letter of acceptance (LOA) by the firm – should have been made on September 20. “As per LOA, the second lot of 15 buses is supposed to be delivered by November 19,” a senior official from the transport department said. In a letter to the firm, the NMC’s transport manager and deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Bhelave pointed out that the first lot of 25 buses should have been delivered by 390 days from the date of LOA. For the remaining 15 buses, the time period was 450 days.The BJP-ruled NMC had refused to accept 100 electric buses being sponsored by the department of heavy industries and public enterprises, owing to its precarious financial condition. Instead it decided to procure only 40 buses under Phase-II of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle).So far, the NMC has received Rs 3.60 crore (of the Rs 18 crore) as it had shortlisted 40 midi e-buses and is receiving Rs45 lakh subsidy for each bus.The NMC will get second and third instalments of Rs7.2 crore each after all 40 e-buses are inducted.The midi bus procured from the firm costs around Rs1.49 crore each and the cost of procuring all e-buses comes to around Rs 60 crore.The NMC has signed a MoU with the firm to operate the buses.To a query, official sources said NMC has also identified a depot at Khapri.

No one was reported injured in the blaze. The fire brigade was yet to ascertain the cause of the blaze. Fire officer Shaukat Shaikh said, “An alert citizen had informed the fire brigade control room about the blaze. A fire tender from the Kondhwa Budruk fire station rushed to the spot and started the fire fighting operation.” The godown, made of tin shed, was spread over an area of nearly 1,500 sq ft. The officer said the fire brigade personnel had a tough time getting access to the godown and putting off the blaze due to the narrow and congested approach route to the facility. Shaikh said,”Since the magnitude of the fire was enormous, three more fire tenders and a water tanker had to be called and pressed into service. The fire was doused in around 90 minutes.” He added, “The godown, filled with wooden furniture and related material, was locked.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/godown-in-kondhwa-gutted-in-early-morning-blaze/articleshow/87213817.cms||---

If forest officials are to be believed, these elephants moved out of Odisha in 2014 and travelled through Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh before entering Maharashtra.Gadchiroli deputy conservator (DyCF) SR Kumaraswamy said, “We are in touch with forest officials from Chhattisgarh and a virtual meeting was also held. It is seven days since the elephants are shuffling between west Murumgaon and south Dhanora ranges. Though Gadchiroli forest is an ideal habitat, we can’t predict if they will stay put. The herd started from Odisha in 2014.”Vivek Menon, executive director and CEO of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), said, “Elephants come only because of water abundance in man-made lakes and due to destruction of habitat from the original haunt.”Ex-member of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) Biswajeet Mohanty, whose Wildlife Society of Odisha (WSO) is working for elephant conservation said, “These elephants must have migrated from Sundargarh and Kendujhar districts of Odisha, where half of the areas are under iron ore and coal mining. These districts are adjoining Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and in the last 10 years, there has been a large-scale exodus of these animals from Odisha. As the memory of elephants is sharp, the herd may or may not settle down in Gadchiroli.”In August 2021, on the basis of a petition filed by WSO, NGT’s east zone, Kolkata, directed the Odisha government to notify 14 elephant corridors in the state in two months in terms of the action plan drawn on the basis of the report of the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (ANCF), a charitable trust conserving elephants.Ankur Tiwari from Dhamtari district in Chhattisgarh confirmed on September 9 that the elephant herd that entered Gadchiroli was seen raiding crops in the farm of one Jogeshwar Patel near Dudhwa dam. Meanwhile, even as Gadchiroli forest officials have intensified monitoring and awareness, honorary warden Uday Patel demanded declaration of Salekasa, Darekasa, Rajoli in Gondia district and Tippagarh and Bhamragarh in Gadchiroli as an elephant reserve.“Elephant tourism can become a big source of income for locals and the forest department. In November 2019, two elephants that entered Korchi in Gadchiroli, had moved towards MP from Salekasa and Darekasa forest,” said Patel.The elephant is a heritage animal and has been included in schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. ‘Project Elephant’ was launched in February 1992 to address the threats to the survival of elephants in our country on account of loss of its habitat, migration path and poaching for tusks. Elephant reserves are not recognized under the WLPA 1972.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/elephant-herd-in-gadchiroli-started-from-odisha-in-2014/articleshow/87211481.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Business||Developing nations will be heard: WTO chief||NEW DELHI: World Trade Organization (WTO) director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala on Friday said that she was hopeful of a positive outcome at the forthcoming ministerial and assured developing countries, including India, that their voice will be heard. “I am hopeful of a good outcome and I felt a lot of support from the Indian side,” the WTO chief told reporters after meeting PM Narendra Modi. The PM backed the multilateral regime and sought support to achieve the objectives of India and other developing countries, she said. During her meetings, the Indian side repeatedly sought a balanced outcome, with special emphasis on resolving the farm-related issues, while ensuring that reforms at the WTO were initiated, something that is expected to be dealt with at next month’s ministerial meeting in Geneva. While India wants the agenda to be limited to issues which have been on the table for over 20 years now, especially agriculture subsidies in the developed countries, there are indications that the WTO membership will push for expanding the mandate of the talks to include “new issues” as well as those that are being discussed among a group of countries and have not been endorsed by all the members. A wider agenda for the ministerial may include issues such as a package to address addition to an agreement on fisheries, addressing some of the lingering issues in the farm sector, new regulations on services sector (being negotiated by a group of countries), as well as deciding on talks around MSMEs and women and trade, which India is opposed to.  “Fisheries and agriculture have been there for a long time. After 20 years, we should try to resolve them,” Okonjo-Iweala said, adding that India’s concerns on food security were understandable. She also said that it was important to get a permanent solution to the peace clause on public stockholding as the interim relief was limited to countries such as India, and other developing countries also needed a solution.  Under existing rules, there are limits on the amount of grains for the public procurement programme. While India had managed to extract a peace clause which bars other countries from taking up the issue at the WTO, it wants that the issue should be settled once and for all. “I cannot guarantee an outcome but I will ask members to push for it,” the WTO chief said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/developing-nations-will-be-heard-wto-chief/articleshow/87215496.cms||---

The perpetrators diverted Rs 9.6 crore from the fixed deposit account of warehousing corporation and Rs 5 crore from the account of oil seed growers federation. Police had registered separate cases based on complaints given by the representatives of the respective organisations. DCP Harshavardan Raju besides the two accused, they have identified eight others who were also involved in the Telugu Academy scam unearthed in Telangana.

---||Jaipur||Patwari exam to be a litmus test for Rajasthan police, personnel pull up socks||JAIPUR: After burning their fingers in REET, where papers had allegedly reached some accused before the exam, Rajasthan police on Friday claimed that adequate security arrangements have been made for the patwari exam that will be held on Saturday and Sunday. Armed police units will be deployed to guard questions papers. Police staff will be posted at examination centres to check students. Additional DG, law and order, Saurabh Shrivastava said that police will also be stationed at important locations to manage traffic and law and order on Saturday and Sunday. Police said in a statement that police headquarters (PHQ) issued special instructions to prevent cheating during the exam. Special Operations Group (SOG) and district police have been told to keep a close eye on the matter. Police said that district police have been told to take strict action against anti-social elements who create chaos and disorder. PHQ has also ordered constant vigilance at bus stands, railway stations, highways, market roads, eateries etc. Besides security and traffic arrangements, police officials admitted that cheating gangs remain a spot of worry. A senior official told TOI on condition of anonymity, that district SPs were told to keep a close watch over suspects who dupe students by promising to field dummy candidates. “The foremost aim is to maintain the sanctity of the exam. Therefore, suspects promising question papers and dummy candidates are all under our scanner,” the official said. More than 15 lakh students are expected to appear in the patwari recruitment exam at over 1,000 centres in the state. The intensified security measures for the patwari exam are attributed to the controversies that erupted soon after REET, when the paper had allegedly reached the accused before the exam on September 26. What had especially embarrassed the senior officials was the alleged involvement of constables in the cheating case. To avert a repeat of the REET fiasco, senior police officials and SPs were holding meetings all through the day to brief their subordinates about their duties. “All arrangements are in place, from manning traffic to checking students at examination centres, police bandobast is adequate to meet any challenge,” an official claimed. While police have assured foolproof security arrangements, the patwari exam for two days will be a litmus test for Rajasthan police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/exam-to-be-a-litmus-test-for-raj-police-personnel-pull-up-socks/articleshow/87214500.cms||---
---||Nashik||Onion prices up 15 per cent at Lasalgaon APMC||NASHIK: The average wholesale onion prices at the country’s largest wholesale onion market at Lasalgaon APMC increased by 15% on Friday, as compared to Thursday, due to a drop in arrival of the produce. The average wholesale onion prices increased to Rs 2,850 per quintal on Friday, against Rs 2,500 per quintal on Thursday. Traders said there has been a huge drop in supply of onions. Heavy rainfall has damaged the crop and delayed the harvest by two weeks. Traders said that the existing summer onion stock with farmers is about to be exhausted. “The kharif onions, which usually start arriving at the market by mid-October, have been delayed. As a result, the supply of the onions has dropped to a large extent, leading to a rise in average wholesale onion price,” said Manoj Jain, an onion trader. The arrivals of onions at the Lasalgaon APMC has reduced from 12,000 quintal a day around fortnight back to 6,000 quintals a day now. Farmers in Nashik are expected to have around 25% of the summer onions stored with them. Moreover, around 25% of onions arriving at the market are of very poor quality and 50% of the medium quality. Only 20-25% of the onions arriving at the market are of good quality, said APMC officials. The price trend will be upwards at Lasalgaon at least for the next fortnight. The fresh kharif onions are expected to arrive after Diwali, said APMC officials. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 900 and Rs 3,311 per quintal, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/onion-prices-up-15-at-lasalgaon-apmc/articleshow/87212249.cms||Tushar Pawar

They would visit Bareilly to procure contraband and smuggle it into Punjab. The STF team left for UP to arrest him, but got information that he was coming to Punjab for smuggling. STF established a check-post near Shambhu border on Delhi-Ludhiana national highway from where Madhur was arrested.“Madhur was in a Maruti Suzuki Swift car (UP16-AE8315) and on frisking, the STF found 1.5kg heroin and 3kg opium from the boot. Madhur, who is pursuing graduation, had also displayed a sticker of ‘Crime Intelligence Force’ on his car to avoid being stopped at check-posts. According to Mangat and Satinder, Madhur and his father both used to provide them drugs. The STF, after verifying the role of Madhur’s father, will nominate him in the case,” the inspector added.

---||Allahabad||More candidates to be declared successful in preliminary exams of UPPSC||PRAYAGRAJ: Candidates preparing for the recruitment examinations conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) have a reason to rejoice. The commission has now decided that for each post, 15 times more candidates would be declared qualified for the main examination. Along with this, candidates numbering three times the total number of posts on offer will be declared successful in the main examination instead of two and thereby be eligible to take part in the interview round of the recruitment process, said UPPSC secretary Jagdish while confirming the development. The officials made clear that this arrangement will be applicable also in Combined State /Upper Subordinate Services (Preliminary)-2021, commonly known as PCS (Preliminary)-2021, and Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF)/Regional Forest Officer (RFO) Preliminary Examination-2021—set to be held on October 24. It has been decided to implement this system in all other examinations except PCS (J) examinations as these are conducted as per separate guidelines as issued by the Allahabad high court, they explained. Till 2019, UPPSC in all its recruitment exams used to declare candidates successful for mains numbering 18 times the total count of vacant posts on offer and candidates numbering two times the total number of posts eligible for the interview round of the recruitment process. However, in 2019 the then chairman of UPPSC Prabhat Kumar changed this system and introduced a new one under which candidates numbering only 13 times the total number of posts on offer were declared successful for the mains and mere two times the total number of vacant posts were declared eligible for the interviews. Students busy preparing for competitive recruitment exams for government jobs have welcomed the move but want the older system of candidates successful for mains numbering 18 times the total count of vacant posts on offer and two times the total number of posts eligible for the interview round. “We welcome this new move by the UPPSC taken in the interest of the thousands of candidates vying for government jobs. However, we want the older system to be brought back that provided an opportunity to a greater number of deserving candidates to prove their mettle before the interview panel,” said Avnish Pandey, president of Pratiyogi Chatra Sangharsh Samiti, an organization representing youths preparing for the recruitment examinations in the state. The organisation’s media in-charge Prashant Pandey said that it must not be forgotten that very small scores separate the toppers of these recruitment exams and declaring more candidates eligible for mains and interviews would only give a better option to the interview panel to determine the best among them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/more-candidates-to-be-declared-successful-in-preliminary-exams-of-uppsc/articleshow/87214503.cms||---

The surgery was performed at New Civil Hospital (NCH). Doctors found that the girl had developed the issue for the second time. Around four years ago a hairball almost the same size was removed from her stomach. Doctors said that the girl started eating her hair due to depression. The 16-year-old girl, a resident of Ghod Dod Road area, had stopped eating properly which led to her losing weight. Noticing a change in her food intake, her family got the girl examined at a private clinic. Medical examinations revealed a hairball in her stomach. The doctors suggested surgery to avoid further health issues.  Medical examinations revealed a hairball in her stomach.The girl’s mother works as housemaid and was unable to pay for the surgery at the private clinic. Later, the girl was brought to NCH where the doctors performed surgery and removed the hairball. “It is a rare case in which the girl had developed the same problem twice due to her habit of eating hairs. After the previous surgery the family did not get her treated for depression hence she continued eating hair,” said Dr Nimesh Verma of NCH. Doctors noticed that the girl is suffering from depression. She plucks hair from or head and also eats those collected in a comb. The exact reason behind her depression will be known only after her psychiatric treatment, the doctors said. Her psychiatric treatment is likely to start at NCH. The girl’s father died around a year ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/500g-hairball-removed-from-girls-stomach-for-second-time/articleshow/87212937.cms||---

As AICC observer, Chaudhary had worked closely with Rawat in trying to diffuse the recent crisis the party had faced in Punjab. The stepping down of Rawat comes a few days after he met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and requested that he be relieved of duties in his “karambhoomi” Punjab so that he could focus on his “janambhoomi” Uttarakhand, where he was chief minister earlier. Both Punjab and Uttarakhand are scheduled to go to the polls early next year and Rawat had expressed his wish to focus exclusively on the Uttarakhand polls. Soon after he was relieved of his Punjab charge, Rawat told TOI, “I would like to thank the party chief for accepting my request. At the same time, I would also like to thank party members and the people of Punjab for their support. I will try to visit the state during the election to extend my support to party candidates.” When asked about his Punjab experience, Rawat said, "It was a big challenge before me. Amarinder Singh is not a small name. The party stood by him for four years but a situation arose where the Congress had to take some strong action. Amarinder has been my friend for four decades but the party and people come first. He needs to realise that he was never sidelined." The former Uttarakhand CM added, "I am happy that my hard work has paid off as Punjab has found an extremely talented CM in Charanjit Singh Channi. I am confident of his vision and leadership skills." On the question of Navjot Singh Sidhu, Rawat said, "Congress has given him a big chance to lead the party in Punjab and now it is his responsibility to take the party ahead."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/cong-relieves-harish-rawat-of-pun-duties-gives-charge-to-raj-leader/articleshow/87212244.cms||Kautilya Singh

Cops said that Ranpara, a compulsive gambler, resorted to theft as he had lost huge money in gambling and betting. “He was under debt and to pay back to his lenders. Ranpara paid his lenders with the gold. We are interrogating him to know about who the lenders were and to whom he had given the gold to,” a police official said. Ranpara was doing business in Rajkot for the last eight years. According to a complaint registered with A division police station on Friday, Tejas disappeared with a total 10.495kg of gold worth Rs 5.29 crore belonging to 12 traders. Rajkot traders do business on trust and jewellers give work to goldsmiths on ‘kutcha’ notes. Ranpara became untraceable for the last three days.

According to case details, some unidentified miscreants had broken into a bungalow owned by a US-based NRI Thakor Patel in September. The accused had also killed an elderly caretaker Ramtu Bhoi (65), who used to double up as a security guard in the night. “From the spot of the crime it was clear that the accused had broken into the bungalow to carry out loot,” said R L Solanki, deputy superintendent of police, who led the special investigation team (SIT) formed by district superintendent of police Ajit Rajian to probe the loot-cum-murder. “We had questioned nearly 150 suspects. One of the suspects confessed that he along with four other accused were involved in loot-cum-murder,” said Solanki.

---||Goa||First charter from UK to land in Goa on December 13||PANAJI: Even as tour operators await booking confirmations from Russian destinations, TUI Airways’ first flight of the season from the UK will land in Goa on December 13. India started issuing visas on October 15, and bookings have been trickling in from other destinations. Travel agents feel the worsening of the pandemic in Russia has halted the bookings. A lack of clarity over SOPs applicable to tourists is another reason bookings have been slow. “We have not received a single booking from Russia so far, though their government has permitted two flights, one from St Petersburg and another from Moscow.  We are waiting for them to inform us what schedule they want us to apply here,” said Abida Kumar, vice-president, operations, Minar Travels (India). Kumar said that soaring Covid-19 cases could be the reason they have not heard from their Russian counterparts so far. “We are told people have been asked to work from home there. We don’t know what’s happening,” she said. Anupam Kumar, director, Caper India, said that bookings from Russia and other nations from the commonwealth of independent states (CIS), their prime market, have been delayed, but is confident that flights will start from November 15. “We know for sure that from November 15, two flights will arrive weekly, although slots have not been allotted yet. From December, we are anticipating more flights, at least five to six a week,” he said. He also said the response in terms of bookings has been decent so far, but more clarity is required in SOPs, which are still not clear. “As soon as that happens, we will have a better understanding of the possible response of tourists,” he said. Ernest Dias, chief operating officer, Sita Travels, said that although (tourism) movement has started, bookings will start once the flight schedule is announced and all SOPs are finalised. “The SOP has been issued but they have to be in detail. We are expecting to get charters from Russia from December,” said Dias. The government of India has announced that international travellers coming to India will have to produce an RT-PCR-negative certificate, and the Goa government has capped the rate of the test at Rs 3,200 for international travellers. Goa receives about 9 lakh international tourists, including 2-2.5 lakh charter arrivals, annually. More than half the charter tourists in Goa come from CIS countries, and the rest from the UK and a few European countries. Last season, for the first time in decades, Goa did not receive a single charter on account of the pandemic. Operators are expecting a decent season after a break of one year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/first-charter-from-uk-to-land-in-goa-on-dec-13/articleshow/87214501.cms||Bindiya Chari

A nominal Rs 50 has been fixed as monthly water supply fee for households above 125 square yards. Even as the municipal corporation has received the notification copy, sources said there was confusion whether the recently-revised or the previous sewerage charges will be imposed.Meanwhile, in a relief to the civic body, the government has decided to bear the electricity dues of its tube-wells. The MC pays around Rs 40 crore annually as electricity charges for supplying potable water to residents through over 1,100 tube-wells.A few days ago, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu had requested CM Charanjit Singh Channi to bear the MC tube-wells’ electricity dues as slashing and non-recovery of water supply fee from residents would hit its resources hard. An MC official said, “Already 1.48 lakh consumers, with property less than 125 square yards, are exempted from the water supply and sewerage charges. The rest will now get nominal water bills. But the sewerage charges will be recovered. There is, however, no clarity whether revised or previous sewerage dues will be recovered. The operation and maintenance cell collected at least Rs 60 crore annually through bills and other means. Slashing of dues would have made it difficult to pay the electricity bills. So, it is good that the government will pay the power charges.”Zonal commissioner Neeraj Jain said, “We have received the notification. Changes will be implemented with immediate effect from October 21.” With this notification, outstanding dues of Rs 431 crore have been waived.Property tax defaultersAn MC official said, “Property tax defaulters, too, are awaiting a similar relief and are not coming forward to pay the dues.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/confusion-over-sewerage-fee-govt-to-foot-mc-tube-well-power-bill/articleshow/87213017.cms||---
---||Nashik||File affidavits on MST: HC tells state, Railways||Nashik: The Bombay High Court has directed the state government and the railways to file affidavits on the issue of allocating Monthly Season Tickets (MST) to daily commuters. The Nashik-based Rail Parishad NX had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) urging the court to issue directives for issuing monthly tickets to daily commuters travelling between the Nashik region and Mumbai and Pune region and Mumbai via the central railway trains. The PIL was filed on behalf of thousands of daily commuters who have been suffering during Covid, despite the railways starting services for travellers in Mumbai via the local trains. “The court has directed the railways and the state government to file affidavits on the demand made by the commuters,” said Sagar Kasar, a lawyer appearing for the petitioner. The PIL is mostly intended for commuters travelling by intercity trains. “The PIL was filed in the court requesting commencement of intercity trains between Nashik region-Mumbai and Pune region-Mumbai, allocating the MST and restoring all the facilities for the travellers, including the divyang and the women MST holders etc,” said Kasar. The bench of Justice SG Dige and Justice AA Sayed issued the directives to the railways and the state. A large number of people travel to and fro from Nashik and Pune region to Mumbai on daily basis. Given the current situation, the railway allocates only six tickets per month to the travellers, which means that the daily travellers, including the employees working in government and the private establishments cannot get confirmed tickets for their travel on other days of the month. Besides, it costs around Rs 1,000 per month to travel between two cities in second class with MST, however, while going with the norm of confirmed ticket travel, the cost goes up to Rs 5,000 per month. Similarly, the cost to travel via first-class by MST is around Rs 3,000, which has now gone up to Rs 15,000. Gurmit Singh, the president of Rail Parishad NX said that they were forced to file a PIL because neither the state government nor the central railways have responded positively to the requests, despite making representations on several occasions. “It may be noted that the western railway has already started issuing MST for several intercity trains,” Singh added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/file-affidavits-on-mst-hc-tells-state-railways/articleshow/87212254.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Cotton crop is grown on over 9.30 lakh hectares in Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts. The cotton season starts in October and stretches up to August-September next year. “This season, the cotton growers are fetching on an average Rs 7,000 for one quintal of raw cotton. Last season, the sale price was below Rs 5,000 a quintal. The Covid pandemic had impacted both, the cotton farmers and traders, last year. Now things are fast improving,” Pradeep Jain, president of Khandesh gin/press factory owners association, told TOI. There are 150 ginning units in these three districts, which buy bulk of the raw cotton from the farmers. These units then process them to make cotton bales, which are then sold to various cotton textile spinning mills, multinational firms, etc. They buy the raw cotton directly through farmers or through auctioning in the mandis in the three districts. The ginning units of the region make over 25 lakh bales during the season and the demand for cotton bales of North Maharashtra is high because of the superior quality. “In the last season, the demand for cotton bales was sluggish as like many other sectors, the textile sector was hit hard due to the pandemic. The scenario has changed this season and the sector is witnessing an upswing in demand. Our feedback is that the domestic consumption of cotton bales is around 3.60 crore at present, which is over 20-25% higher during the corresponding period last year,” added Jain. According to him, the Centre’s recent announcement of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme would have a positive impact on the prices of raw cotton. Pravin Koli, a cotton farmer from Jalgaon, said they were forced to sell the produce at a cost lower than the production cost last year. “The mood among the cotton farmers is upbeat as the prices are high. This will help some farmers make up for the losses they suffered due to crop damage after heavy rainfall last month,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/good-rate-for-cotton-cheers-north-maharashtra-farmers/articleshow/87212262.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The judge while hearing a petition filed by an association representing some parents said they came to court in a belated manner. All the arrangements must have been made by the authorities now for the smooth conduct of examinations. You came to court at the last minute. This court is not inclined to stall the process at this stage, the judge said.  The petitioner association then withdrew the petition. Scores of first-year students were promoted to the second year of their intermediate study a few months ago due to Covid-19 curbs and pandemic situations. But later, the authorities have announced their decision that they would conduct exams for first-year now.Many students and their parents were worried about this decision as the students have to study their first-year subjects again. This will affect their second-year studies, some of the petitioners said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Average PM2.5 level for monsoon, pre-winter season lowest in 4 years||NEW DELHI: An analysis done by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says the average PM2.5 concentration of monsoon and pre-winter season (July 1 to October 15) was lowest in 2021 compared with the last four years. Track the pollution level in your cityHowever, a delayed start of winter with multiple spurts of rain, as seen in 2019-20, is similar to the conditions prevailing this year. It can be expected that smog might have higher peak pollution this year if special steps are not taken to reduce the pollution from the sources. As Delhi recorded excess rainfall, it resulted in the cleanest monsoon in the last four years. The city-wide average for the monsoon and pre-winter season this year stood at 41 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3), with 96 days meeting the 24-hour standard for PM2.5. There was a progressive increase in the number of cleaner days with an average 6% annual improvement since 2018, said CSE. Though winter began on October 15 at a cleaner level, CSE’s analysis stated that 2021-22 might have higher peak pollution. “On average, the 2020-21 winter season was 5% worse among the major NCR cities and Delhi compared with last year, but the peak pollution on average was 13% lower,” it added. “Even though the average level during 2019-20 was lesser than other winters, the peak daily pollution was considerably higher across all major NCR cities. This can be attributed to September and October rainfall that pushed and concentrated the farm stubble burning towards the end of October and start of November when winter conditions were turning more adverse,” CSE’s report further stated. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, “The winter of 2021 is starting with a cleaner threshold compared with the previous years, largely due to the intense and prolonged effect of the monsoon. While winter pollution cannot be predicted at this moment, the evidence of rising summer pollution in 2021 despite the lockdown and the evidence of a synchronised effect of winter pollution across the Indo-Gangetic Plain add to our concern. How soon and intensely the winter pollution will hit us will depend on the scale and speed of action across the region and leveraging it for more sustained air quality gains.” However, summer 2021 was more polluted as the seasonal average rose to 79 ug/m3 and the number of days meeting the prescribed standard was 51, as against 90 in 2020. “PM2.5 levels this summer have almost returned to the 2019 levels despite the partial lockdowns,” mentioned the report. The report also said that particulate pollution dominated the daily pollution in Delhi during pre-winter season (September 1 to October 15), but other gaseous pollutants, like ozone and carbon monoxide, had become the lead pollutants along with particulate pollution of the day due to washout effect of rain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/average-pm2-5-level-for-monsoon-pre-winter-season-lowest-in-4-yrs/articleshow/87213849.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Two killed, two injured as rival gangs exchange fire near eatery at Uruli Kanchan||Pune: Two men, including Santosh Jagtap — a criminal on the records of the district rural police, succumbed to multiple bullet injuries as members of rival gangs exchanged fire in front of Hotel Sonai, an eatery, at Talawade Chowk in Uruli Kanchan along the Pune-Solapur highway around 2.30pm on Friday. Jagtap’s two private bodyguards also suffered bullet injuries. One of them is in a critical condition. The other deceased was identified as Swagat Khaire. Senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi of the Loni Kalbhor police said, “Old animosity arising out of sand-lifting, land deals and other business interests in Daund and adjoining areas might be the cause behind the shootout. We are verifying different angles. Jagtap hailed from Rahu village in Daund taluka.” Mokashi said, “The other deceased, Swagat Khaire, had reached the eatery with four others in a sedan. They first opened fire at Jagtap moments after he had stepped out to have lunch. Khaire was among the four men who came out of the car, while the fifth (the driver) stayed back. Shailesh Singh, one of Jagtap’s bodyguards, fired in retaliation. The incident has been captured by CCTV cameras installed at the eatery.” Mokashi said Jagtap and Khaire died of multiple bullet wounds in the crossfire. “Singh suffered a bullet wound on his hip. Monu Singh, the other bodyguard, suffered a bullet wound on his neck. His condition has been described by medical authorities as serious. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Loni Kalbhor. We are waiting for the preliminary post-mortem reports of Jagtap and Khaire,” he added. DCP Namrata Patil, who rushed to the shootout site, told TOI, “We have recovered a country-made pistol, five empty rounds and a live bullet from the scene of the crime. As of now, we suspect the seized pistol was being carried by one of the assailants, but we are verifying if it was Khaire or any other assailant. The police will also seize the firearms from Jagtap’s two bodyguards. Jagtap himself was not carrying any firearms.” Patil said, “We have identified some of the assailants and search is on to nab the car driver and the three other assailants, who drove off towards Uruli Kanchan after the firing.” Pune commissioner of police (CP) Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “The shootout did occur under the jurisdiction of the city police, but both the rival groups have been active in the Pune rural police area for some time now. We have sought updated information about these groups from the rural police. We shall take the case to its logical conclusion at the earliest.” Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI, “Jagtap and (slain gangster) Appa Londhe ran separate outfits and were active in the Hadapsar-Uruli Kanchan-Loni Kalbhor belt. Jagtap had eight cases to his name, including two under MCOCA. A special MCOCA court in Pune had ordered Jagtap’s release on bail in 2019.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/2-killed-2-injured-as-rival-gangs-exchange-fire-near-eatery-at-uruli-kanchan/articleshow/87213843.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Kolkata||Red light at New Town craters; repairs soon||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is set to take up a road repair drive across New Town soon. As an interim measure, the authorities will be installing red warning lights at the collapsed spots to alert motorists and pedestrians, especially at night. The authorities held a video conference with the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) and Public Health Engineering (PHE) authorities to chalk out an action plan for the drive. Roads and lanes in several parts of New Town have been battered due to heavy rain. Roads at some places have caved in dangerously, thus putting several motorists and pedestrians at risk. A long stretch beside Eden Court housing complex has been shut after a large portion of the road collapsed. At present, the authorities have cordoned off the caved-in portions of the roads with bamboo fences for the safety of the motorists. Officials attributed the reason behind such road collapses to prolonged waterlogging in New Town. “Last month there was heavy deluge that weakened the underground soil and water seeped through the road surface. Large parts of Action Area II and III that are close to Bagjola canal had been waterlogged for nearly a week,” said an NKDA official. “We have already contacted the experts at Jadavpur University to know if there is any other reason behind such road collapses. It is a matter of ground stability and we want to be sure about the exact cause of such road collapses. Their suggestions will help us repair the battered stretches properly,” said the official. The authorities will fill up the potholes on other damaged roads in the township before taking up the permanent repair project that involves the laying of fresh bituminous top layer. Before Durga Puja, the authorities had carried out brick patchwork on a temporary basis at some places. “Hopefully, we will get a few weeks of dry weather for the road repair to be conducted,” said an official. In some places, paver blocks have been damaged. “We have asked our engineers to rectify this by October 31,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/red-light-at-new-town-craters-repairs-soon/articleshow/87213864.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The Union power ministry-led Bureau of Energy Efficiency had recently finalised an action plan to implement the BEEP in the state housing scheme. The BEEP has come forward to conduct training on Eco-Niwas Samhitha (energy conservation building code for residential buildings) to around 13,000 engineers/employees in housing department and village/ward secretariat departments in a phased manner. Addressing the seminar, special chief secretary for housing department Ajay Jain said the state government has a strong commitment towards effective implementation of housing scheme and providing best housing facilities for the poor. “The need of the hour is to create awareness on energy conservation building code for residential buildings as the state government prepares to implement global energy efficiency practices in 28.3 lakh houses,” said Jain. He added the energy efficiency programmes will benefit all the consumers, ecology and economy of the state. “Residential buildings will become the largest end-user of electricity in the country, accounting for 38% of the total electricity consumption. Andhra Pradesh’s domestic sector alone consumes around 17,000 million units (28%) per annum out of the total annual demand of 61,000 MU,” he said.  India representative of Indo-Swiss BEEP, Sameer Maithel, said the training to 13,000 engineers of village/ward secretariat staff would be the biggest training programme and first time in the country pertaining to energy efficiency training in the building sector. “The AP housing department has given its approval for the training which shows the commitment of the state government to let the poor people benefit from the energy efficiency and energy conservation measures in their day to day lives,” said Sameer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/energy-efficient-housing-tech-training-for-13k-staff/articleshow/87213851.cms||---

Usually, only three companies of central paramilitary forces are deployed during a bypoll. But with situation already on the boil in certain pockets of the constituency and a nail-biting contest on the cards, the poll body has decided to send additional CRPF, BSF and ITBP personnel. On Friday, there was a scuffle between BJP and TRS cadres in Sirisedu village where Union minister Kishan Reddy and BJP candidate Eatala Rajender were holding an election meeting. A sub-inspector also slapped a TRS activist after he held the SI by his collar. Trouble began after TRS activists allegedly raised slogans against Eatala and angry BJP workers rushed towards the TRS office raising slogans against the ruling party. When an SI tried to send TRS leaders inside their party office, they objected and raised slogans against the police. The incident was captured on camera and was soon viral. Earlier, Telangana chief electoral officer (CEO) Shashank Goel said the forces en route to Huzurabad were in addition to state police and would be deployed across the constituency. “The central paramilitary forces will be deployed for area domination, combing operations and election duty as well,” he said.The opposition BJP has been alleging misuse of the state police force by the ruling TRS for electoral gains. Earlier, the ECI had issued orders halting Dalit Bandhu scheme in Huzurabad constituency. So far, Rs 1.9 crore and liquor worth Rs 6 lakh has been seized by police and other agencies since the election schedule was announced. Law enforcement agencies were also keeping a tab on e-wallets, anticipating suspicious transactions during the last three days leading to the bypoll. Also, CCTVs have been installed in strategic places.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ec-rushes-20-companies-of-central-forces-to-huzurabad/articleshow/87215041.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

At least eight persons have been killed by the herd in the past few years. The deceased and the injured persons’ families are yet to get full compensation from the government, alleged K Samba Murthy, a Komarada-based activist. “Though compensation for human deaths by a wild animal is Rs 5 lakh and for injuries is Rs 75,000, the victims have got only 50 per cent of the announced amount,” he said. There has been no revision of compensation amount for crop damage caused by elephants for the past six years. “For instance, AP government fixed a compensation of Rs 6,000 for damage of paddy and sugarcane crops per acre, when the loss suffered by farmers is much more than that amount,” Murthy added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/elephants-damage-crops-in-vzm-district/articleshow/87213873.cms||---

Owaisi alleged that the Modi government had left the state and the people to their fate until the Supreme Court intervened which led to the BJP government changing its Covid-19 vaccine policy. In a series of tweets, Owaisi said: “Modi: no VIP culture in the vaccination campaign. Only India has an exclusive corporate sector vaccine quota of 25 per cent. Modi placed the first vaccine order just five days before the campaign began. He left states and the people to their fate. He changed the policy because SC intervened.” He further tweeted that this incompetence and absence of vision cost lakhs of lives in the second wave. “We lost our loved ones. We should never forget the lives lost due to neglect and lack of compassion,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/asad-takes-potshots-at-pms-vip-remark/articleshow/87213870.cms||---

---||Goa||RUFC write new chapter in history of Rajasthan football||Panaji: Rajasthan United FC almost did not make it to the I-League qualifiers. Having finished second behind Zinc Football Academy in the state league, Rajasthan United had to rely on the champions being turned down by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for their inability to fulfil the club licensing criteria. The AIFF had a one-state-one-team policy, so Rajasthan United, the next in the queue, got the nod. Even when Rajasthan started their campaign in the preliminary round of I-League qualifiers with a thrilling 3-2 win against Ryntih SC, not many gave them a chance. They had almost thrown away a 3-0 lead and there were far stronger teams in their path like Bengaluru United and Delhi FC. Rajasthan kept going. They remained unbeaten all through the qualifiers and sealed a spot in the I-League with a goalless draw against Kenkre FC at the Bangalore Football Stadium on Saturday. They are the first team from Rajasthan to qualify for the I-League and follows in the footsteps of Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Karnataka, Mizoram, Manipur and Kashmir. “After our camp in Goa where we played friendlies and won against local teams, I knew we would make it out of our (preliminary) group, but wasn’t so sure about the final round,” coach Vikrant Sharma told TOI on Saturday. “It helped us that we were drawn to play Delhi in the first game. Once we defeated them, there was no looking back.” A solitary goal victory against Delhi in the final round was followed by a 2-0 win against Madan Maharaj. That put Rajasthan in pole position, and they grabbed the point they needed to qualify in the decisive game against second-placed Kenkre. “The camp in Goa helped a lot. We played friendlies against local teams. When we didn’t have a ground to train, we simply went to the beach,” said Sharma, a former goalkeeper who played in the top-tier of Indian football with clubs like Dempo SC, Churchill Bros and Pax of Nagoa. Sharma had come close to qualifying with Hindustan Club in 2018, before being pipped in the decisive game by Real Kashmir FC. At Rajasthan too, it wasn’t easy. He took charge of the team just three days prior to their opener in the state league, and at the end of it all knew reinforcements were needed. Time, though, was short. Still Rajasthan managed to sign 14 new players, including Nigerian Akeem Abioye, the only foreign player in the team. They had signed another foreigner -- Cheick Hamza – but his transfer fell through due to registration issues. “At every team meeting I told the players to believe in themselves, keep the ball and don’t worry about the result,” said Sharma. They did not lose a single game, so there was never really a reason to worry. Rajasthan will make their debut in the I-League this year itself. The state has not had any professional football clubs, though Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) were among India’s better-known teams in the sixties and seventies, thanks to the exploits of the Rajvi brothers -- Magan Singh and Chain Singh. Rajasthan United have now written a new chapter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/rufc-write-new-chapter-in-history-of-rajasthan-football/articleshow/87230679.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Parbhani police file 800-page charge sheet||AURANGABAD: The Parbhani police have filed an 800-page charge sheet in murder case of businessman Suresh Karwa. The key accused in the case, who was a friend of the deceased, and his accomplices, have been charged of murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence. Police officers claimed that on the evening of May 2, Karwa was returning from his farm on Siddhanath Borgaon Road, when he was run over by a speeding truck. Accordingly, an offence was registered against the truck driver on the charges of causing death due to negligence and also for rash and negligent driving. Later, the police found an audio clip purportedly of a conversation between Karwa’s wife and his friend Rahul Kasat. The audio clip allegedly revealed that Kasat was the brain behind the accident. Police authorities said that the case took a turn after two policemen were caught by the anti-corruption bureau for demanding a bribe of Rs 2 crore and accepting Rs 10 lakh as token from the accused. The departmental probe revealed that the bribe was allegedly demanded to keep the audio clip under wraps and not making Kasat an accused in the case, senior policemen said. Then, a police team headed by probationary assistant superintendent of police Shravan Dath was tasked with carrying out a probe in the case. The local crime branch team led by assistant inspector Vyankatesh Alewar nabbed Kasat from Hyderabad on August 12. Authorities claimed that Kasat has confessed to being involved in the crime. Five others, who allegedly helped him, have also been arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/parbhani-police-file-800-page-charge-sheet/articleshow/87212314.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||WC, Dubai expo: 400% rise in Telangana flyers to UAE||HYDERABAD: It’s destination United Arab Emirates (UAE) for many from city and elsewhere in state. Bookings with travel agents have risen by 400% as it’s a double delight for flyers this month — the pandemic-hit Dubai Expo 2020 kicking off after a year’s delay and ICC Men’s T20 World Cup (WC) pitching tent in the Gulf emirate. “There is about 400-500% increase in demand for UAE tickets now,” said Abdul Majid Faheem of Travel Agents Federation of India-Hyderabad. The ticket prices have also exponentially increased, with a one-way ticket from Hyderabad to Dubai now going for anywhere between Rs 14,000 and Rs 25,000 Apart from Expo and WC, even leisure travellers are heading to UAE as it was one of the few international destinations allowing tourists. “Even those having transit flights, are preferring to spend a day or two in Dubai,” Faheem said. Daniel D’Souza, president & country head, SOTC Travel added: “Lockdown fatigue and easy access to a short-haul flight have created a demand for UAE from our Telangana/Hyderabad source markets. Expo 2020 Dubai and T20 WC are clear drivers. We are 100% up in demand with a 3x uptick in bookings for Dubai compared to August-Sept and this is growing in October.” Cricket being nothing short of a religion in India, the faith and fun attached to it has clearly trumped the fear of Covid. “My friends and I are here to watch the match. We have planned it in such a way that we can also take a vacation,” said Naveen S, a resident of Madhura Nagar in the city, who landed in Dubai on October 15. For others it’s the need to make up for lost business opportunity in the last year. With the World Expo at hand, many decided to mix business with pleasure as they could finally spend quality time with family members living there. “I will be heading to the expo in November,” said Avion Holidays MD Siraj Ansari, adding that he would be there to promote tourism. Likewise, Praveen Raju K, co-chairman of FICCI Arise and founder of Suchitra Academy, said that he would be at the Expo in December for the school education week to promote best practices followed in India. The GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) data also revealed that Dubai, Doha and Sharjah were the favourite destinations among international travellers from city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/wc-dubai-expo-400-rise-in-t-flyers-to-uae/articleshow/87215043.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Jaipur||Prashasan Gaon ke Sang camps are not user-friendly: Report by NGOs||Jaipur: The civil society groups monitoring Prashasan Gaon Ke Sang in rural areas have claimed that the camps are not user-friendly and the cumbersome process is not able to provide much help to the complainants. The preliminary report by Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) says that every second person even after registering his/her complaint is not able to meet the officials at camps due to the rush and limited resources. The major issue leading to the delay in registration is the provision of a single e-Mitra window leading to several beneficiaries returning without any help. Keshar Devi of Hamela-Ki-Bar gram panchayat has been falsely marked as a dead in the records leading to non-reimbursement of pension. She visited the camp couple of days ago at Bhim but was not able to resolve her issue which means that she will not be geting the pension this month either. "I travelled a long distance to enquire why I am dead in the records. The pension of Rs 1,000 is very crucial for my family and I need it for my survival," Devi told the MKSS volunteer at a camp in Bhim. She is not alone facing the brunt of the anomaly. Kamarudadin of Badnor panchayat in Bhilwara holding all his documents proving that he is alive at a camp at Asind in Bhilwara too had to return empty-handed. The rush at the camp didn’t allow him to address his problem. Similar problems are being faced by people in several districts. Kamal Damor of Banswara has been going to the camp for registering his widow daughter into the Ekal Nari pension scheme but has been unsuccessful. "Neither was I able to do it at the local civic body nor in the special camp here. I wish they had more people attending to beneficiaries else the purpose of administration with the people is defeated," said Damor. Amid irregularities, there are cases which fulfil the actual purpose of the programme. "Centenarian Amari Devi couldn’t get her address changed in government records to receive the amount in the bank. She was given instant relief by sending her case for restarting pension to Social Justice and Empowerment Dept, Jaipur, in the camp," said Tanvi Makkar, a full-time worker at MKSS. List of some important works set to be done in the camps: 1. Return/ reject pensions, correction 2. Scheme change in pensions (like old age to widow) 3. Palanhaar renewal 4. Issuance of Ekal Naari certificate 5. Issuance of disability certificate (including silicosis) 6. New pension and palanhaar sanction 7. Issuance of concessional travel certificate for senior citizens 8. Issuance of death and birth certificates 9. Issuance of the land document (abaadi bhoomi patta) under PM Awaas Yojana 10.

She had filed a petition in Bombay high court for an inquiry into the alleged restrictions placed by jail authorities. She said he and other co-accused in the case were being restricted from writing to their spouses and lawyers. Teltumbde is lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Central Jail. There was a similar petition filed by Susan Abraham, wife of his co-accused in the case, Vernon Gonsalves.  The NIA reply said, “The petitioner wants the husband… to pass off prohibited material in the nature of the letter. One of the other co-accused had written an article titled ‘Economic goals cannot Disavow Constitutional Vision’, such contents of letters were then published by a magazine…” A bench of Justice Nitin M Jamdar and Justice Sarang Kotwal on Friday could not hear the matter as it did not reach for hearing due to paucity of time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-dismiss-plea-by-kin-of-elgar-accused-about-jail-letters-says-nia/articleshow/87213911.cms||---

Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao had raised a grievance that local clubs are not getting grounds for training. Replying to the Zero Hour mention, the chief minister said that recently three grounds have been handed over to panchayats for maintenance. “The government is ready to hand over the grounds with an agreement. It would be great if a club takes responsibility to maintain the ground,” Sawant said Raising the issue earlier, Alemao said that there was fear and anxiety in the minds of people about availability of football grounds for training to local clubs and that most of the local grounds have been given to outstation teams for training purposes. Stating that there are a lot of grounds in Goa, as compared to the rest of the country, Alemao said that in Kolkata there are three football clubs and that their government has given them grounds. Further, he questioned why I-league local teams do not have a ground for training. Meanwhile, congratulatory references were made to a number of sports personalities. FC Goa was congratulated for winning the Durand Cup 2021 and for being the first Goan team to do so. The house also complimented all those who won medals at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ready-to-hand-over-grounds-to-local-clubs-for-training-cm/articleshow/87214535.cms||---

The identity of the deceased and the injured could not be established immediately, police said. Just a day earlier, on Thursday, two women were killed and five others were injured when a container truck caused a pile-up of several vehicles close to the same Narhe selfie point. Speaking about Friday’s accident, senior inspector Devidas Gheware of the Sinhagad road police station told TOI, “The tanker transporting thinner was heading from Katraj in the direction of Narhe when its driver brushed past the mini bus. The impact of the accident was such that the mini bus overturned, killing one of its passengers. Twelve others in the bus suffered injuries. Later, two more people were found dead under the bus.” The police suspect that the two people found dead under the bus could have been passersby. Gheware said, “The tanker driver lost control of his vehicle and went on to hit a few more vehicles before overturning. The accident threw vehicular traffic out of gear. With help from the traffic police, we diverted vehicles via the Bharati Vidyapeeth deemed university.” Gheware said a crane towed the tanker to the side of the road while fire-brigade personnel brought out the injured passengers trapped in the bus. The fire-brigade also cleaned the thinner which had spilled onto the road, he added. On Thursday, two women died and five others were injured after a container truck caused a multi-vehicle pile-up on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/3-die-12-hurt-as-bus-overturns-after-being-hit-by-tanker-at-narhe/articleshow/87213894.cms||---

The contraband from Visakhapatnam was bound for Maharashtra, cops said. Two peddlers, D Mani Kumar alias Durga, a native of Visakhapatnam, and B Bichiya, a resident of Chennaraopet village in Warangal, were also arrested during the raid by the task force cops along with Inthezargunj police. A woman, identified as Maheshwari, who brought the ganja on a train from Visakhapatnam, is absconding. The inter-state gang’s modus operandi involved the ganja being procured from Visakhapatnam by Maheshwari who would then hand it over to the two arrested peddlers at the railway station. This time, however, the cops pounced on the duo before it could be sent to Maharashtra. Warangal police commissioner Dr Tarun Joshi told media that as per preliminary probe the smugglers were routing the ganja to Maharashtra as it fetched twice the price due to high demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/32kg-ganja-bound-for-maha-seized/articleshow/87213896.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

---||Delhi||To help commuters, Delhi Metro cuts long queues with more gates||NEW DELHI: Waiting in serpentine queues outside Delhi Metro stations, most of which allowed entry only from a single gate, has been the biggest grouse of commuters in the last one year. Keeping the inconvenience faced by commuters in mind, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is opening more gates while ensuring social distancing in its stations. Metro train services were halted for 169 days due to the Covid-19 last year and for 48 days this year. DMRC has been regulating entry to its stations to ensure there is no crowding on the platforms. Though commuters have been demanding more entry points to reduce the waiting outside stations, which sometimes stretches for an hour during peak hours, DMRC has been cautious about doing so. It has now opened additional gates at many stations and also changed its strategy to ensure social distancing. The Delhi Metro network has 253 stations and a cumulative 671 entrances. However, when the services resumed after 48 days on June 7, DMRC made do by opening only 257 gates. By the end July, DMRC opened 75 more gates, taking the number to 332. At present, 414 gates can be used by the public to enter the stations. “We have allowed entry through more entrances having realised that making commuters stand outside the station causes a lot of discomfort and irritation,” DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh told TOI. He said that there is now a queue in the space between the security checkpoint and the entry gate. Singh said that more passengers are accommodated in the subways, staircase area, etc., instead of being exposed to the elements outside the stations. “We are only allowed to operate with seated passengers, and even in non-peak hours, we can’t say we are in a comfortable situation,” said Singh. “However, I must thank commuters that by and large, they are very disciplined, maintain social distancing norms and cooperate with the metro system.” He added that incidents where officials had to intervene and take action have been minimal. Singh felt that commuters had by now reconciled to the scenario and weren’t dismayed by long waits. “They also know that trains are running at full frequency but there is a limit on the number of passengers allowed in a coach. Things are easier now on that account,” he said. The DMRC managing director said that many people had begun commuting with work from home seeing some reduction. “People are also using private transport, either because of inconvenience or because they feel safer in their own vehicles,” Singh said. “However, the capacity at which we are operating isn’t enough to meet the actual demand.” He said the ridership would go up hugely once the pandemic was under control.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/to-help-commuters-metro-cuts-long-queues-with-more-gates/articleshow/87231201.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Delhi University: 3rd cutoff window shuts, 58k seats taken||NEW DELHI: Admissions under the third cutoff list at Delhi University (DU) came to a close, with Friday being the last day for principals to approve applications for respective colleges. Till 6.30pm, the varsity saw over 58,000 seats taken out of the total 70,000 on offer this year. According to official data, 9,614 applications were approved till Friday evening and 58,406 students had completed the payment process. Aspirants have time till Saturday to complete the payment process and secure seats. At Kirori Mal College (KMC), officials said that almost two thirds of the seats were taken after the third cutoff list. Siddharth Lahon, admission convenor at KMC, said, “Around 950 admissions have taken place in the college under the three lists. Most of the courses will, however, remain open as there have been cancellations along with the fresh admissions.” Sri Venkateswara College saw admissions in “good numbers”, said admission convener Sanjay Batra. “All the prime courses in our college are full for the general and OBC categories. Courses like history, BCom (H), political science are almost full. Even in science courses, chemistry, bio-chemistry and geology saw a good rush. However, the process is very dynamic as campus colleges need to stabilise first. The moment there is a drop in their cutoffs students may shift and some seats over here may open up,” Batra explained. The varsity will be releasing a special cutoff on Monday for students who have been unable to apply under the first three cutoffs. The special cutoff will be declared subject to availability of seats in the respective courses. Candidates who have secured admission in the first three cutoffs will not be allowed to participate in the special cutoff. “The special cutoff will be the last declared cutoff of the respective programme and college. For example, if for a college a particular subject closed at 98% after the first list and the college did not declare cutoffs in the subsequent lists but later seats got vacant, then under the special cutoff list, the cutoff will continue to remain 98%. The last declared cutoff will be considered,” a senior university official explained.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/3rd-cutoff-window-shuts-58k-seats-taken/articleshow/87213904.cms||---

At least so it seems with industry sources hinting at the possibility of club timings being extended by an hour, following meetings with government officials. Currently, all watering holes in town have to pull their shutters down at midnight. This rule was put in place in 2017, soon after the high profile drug bust that brought under the scanner several T-town celebrities. It also unmasked a network of suppliers. Four years on — post a pandemic — these establishments have sought some relief. “Members of the hospitality sector met senior state government officials recently where this issue was discussed. Authorities were informed about the losses the industry suffered during the lockdown and how an extension would benefit them. Officials verbally agreed to the proposal,” said an industry representative in the know of things. While Telangana’s excise minister, V Srinivas Goud, told TOI that the government is yet to take a final decision on the matter, he agreed that the proposal was under consideration. “We are currently studying the rules and regulations that are in place in other states. Once we do that we will bring it up for discussion and take a call,” Goud said. Pub owners said the decision, if rolled out, will benefit them. “An hour’s extension means a revenue increase of about 20%. That is crucial for us right now as we are still reeling under the impact of the lockdown,” said Dheeraj Melwani, president, Hyderabad Restro-Lounges Association. He added: “At present, most revellers are expected to start leaving the premises from 11.30pm onwards. This is too early since many step in only after 10pm, post work. The extension will prove to be win-win for all — us, our guests and the government.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/last-drink-at-1am-bar-owners-hopeful/articleshow/87215045.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

These men had floated a company in 2016 with registered offices in Delhi-NCR such as Ghaziabad and Hapur, among others. "The joint effort of Bahadurgarh police station and surveillance units had been trying to track the five accused for months and eventually they were successful in arresting Ashok Singh, Ashok Kumar, his wife Sunita; Dharmpal Singh and wife Sushma. An award of Rs 50,000 was announced on the men and Rs 25,000 on the women," said Deepak Bhukar, Hapur SP, on Friday. "During investigation it has come to light that these people had more than 200 Demat accounts. The police team recovered Rs 7 lakh, a luxury SUV and passbooks of several banks apart from two laptops and six smart phones. So far, we have unearthed a fraud of Rs 200 crore, but it can go upto Rs 500 crore," Bhukar added. According to Hapur police officials, the accused with almost two dozen cases filed against them in different cities of Delhi-NCR have been arrested from Syana crossing in Hapur after a tip-off. Over the years, the company through its network of agents spread all around these districts would lure unsuspecting people to swanky offices and convince them to invest in the firm and bring others, too. "They also told their prospective targets that the company had strong links with the share market and had experts to manage their funds. These agents even managed farmers to take loans on their lands to invest in the company and also targeted retired army personnel to take out pension funds. And once their target was met, the company would close its offices and the agents would disappear," said Vijay Gupta, SHO of Bahadurgarh in Hapur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/5-directors-with-offices-in-ncr-dupe-investors-of-rs-500-crore-arrested/articleshow/87213129.cms||Sandeep Rai

The judgment has been delivered in about a month's time after the crime. The court also convicted the accused, Dinesh, under various sections of the IPC and Pocso Act and imposed a fine of over Rs 2 lakh. He has been awarded life imprisonment of seven years each for the kidnap and illegal confinement of the girl. Observing that the crime was brutal and reflected demonic tendencies, special court judge Rekha Rathore observed that children have a right to live happily in the society without any fear or insecurity. “If the children in our society are not safe at home and outside, it is a matter of concern. Protecting children has become a daunting task for parents and those responsible for such crime are a big stigma to society. If he is kept alive then there is a possibility of committing such crime in future and thus the morale of other criminals will increase,” the special judge remarked in the judgment. While awarding capital punishment, the special judge said the case was the “rarest of the rare”. "Under Section 5(I)(m)9i)/6 of Pocso Act, the convict Dinesh (26) has been given capital punishment. Under Section 363 (Punishment for kidnapping) of IPC, seven years life imprisonment and Rs 1 lakh fine has been imposed. Likewise, under Section 342 (Wrongful confinement) of IPC, one year life imprisonment and Rs 1,000 fine has been imposed. The court has also convicted him under Section 201 (For causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of IPC and given seven years imprisonment and Rs 1 lakh fine," special public prosecutor Sumer Singh Beda told TOI. Meanwhile, the police department expressed their happiness over the judgment. "After the rape and murder on September 20, my team of five officers burnt midnight oil to make prompt arrest and file and submit a strong chargesheet. We have also put relevant reports of the heinous act before the court," said Degana circle officer Nand Lal Saini, the investigating officer in the case. The 8-year-old girl was raped and murdered on September 20 and the accused was arrested the next day. On September 27, the police had filed the chargesheet in the court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/capital-punishmentfor-rape-murder-ofminor-girl-in-nagaur/articleshow/87214534.cms||Ashish Mehta

Speaking at the event, Sisodia said that the three biggest challenges before the country today were unemployment, lack of quality education and slow economic progress. To deal with them would be the biggest act of patriotism, he stated. The event was held to commemorate the 121st birth anniversary of Shaheed Asfaqullah Khan. “Patriotism is within all of us but we adopt patriotism as per our convenience. The Kejriwal government has initiated Deshbhakti curriculum in the schools of Delhi to expand upon this patriotism. Its purpose is to increase the scope of patriotism in everyday life and to eliminate the fragmented patriotism as it exists today,” Sisodia said. Adding that it was important to think of the “immortal martyrs,” the deputy CM said, “Our patriotic martyrs sacrificed their lives to liberate the country. Now the patriotic youth through their knowledge should prepare to deal with these challenges before the country.” He also said that over 12,000 youths had joined the “Desh Ke Mentor” programme within one week of its launch. “Education has a wide dimension. We want the community to be associated with education and work to make it a mass movement. The youth should fulfil their responsibility towards the nation by becoming a mentor. Some credit points will also be given to college students who become mentors,” Sisodia said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/12000-youths-joined-desh-ke-mentor-programme-within-a-week-of-launch-says-sisodia/articleshow/87213915.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government is considering provision for reservation of EV parking spaces in the existing buildings too. Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, which was notified in September 2019, makes the civic bodies responsible for arranging required parking space in areas under their jurisdiction, including preparing and implementing area parking plans, which require approval of the apex monitoring committee. At the meeting on Friday, area parking plans prepared based on guidelines of the transport department and in consultation with RWAs, market associations etc., were discussed. Gahlot directed South Delhi Municipal Corporation to take lead on compiling all the plans after assessment of parking capacity, length of stretch and type of vehicle, and expedite procuring NOCs from the enforcement agencies and Delhi Police. “Area parking plans are not just about parking vehicles, but improving the quality of life and making life easier for the public. Vendors, non-motorised transport, parks and recreational spaces find a crucial place in these plans,” Gahlot said. “I also urge the citizens to park responsibly and try to switch to EVs. Most importantly use more public transport, which will address a lot of these issues from the grassroots level,” he said in a statement. The possibilities of using geospatial data to map EV user coordinates and plot influence area with owner coordinates for developing private charging clusters was also discussed at the meeting. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-considering-5-quota-for-ev-parking-in-existing-buildings/articleshow/87213921.cms||---

Profit grew to Rs 15,479 crore in the Q2FY22. Revenue totalled over Rs 1.7 lakh crore, up 50%, as markets revived after the second wave of the pandemic in Q1FY22. Operating profit edged up 30% to Rs 30,283 crore in the July through September months, aided by strong earnings in its three main businesses. “The results demonstrate the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies. All our businesses reflect growth over pre-Covid levels,” said chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani. Operating profit of O2C increased 44% to Rs 12,720 crore due to higher volumes and price realisations. Operating profit of digital services climbed 15% to Rs 9,561 crore due to higher data usage by subscribers. However, average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key metric that influences income — was slightly down to Rs 144 in Q2FY22. ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Launched in 2016, Jio has 430 million customers (as of September end, down from previous quarter’s 441 million) and saw data and voice traffic growth of 51% and 18%, respectively, on its network. ARPU in the yearago period was Rs 145. Operating profit of the retail business rose 44% to Rs 2,923 crore as pandemic related curbs eased operating conditions and vaccines helped in lifting sales. RIL said it saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer sentiments amid festivities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-q2-net-jumps-46-on-oil-digital-retail-business/articleshow/87215548.cms||---

This was revealed by the School Bus Owners Association (SBOA)which also informed TOI, that over 500 school buses are up for sale as owners want to discontinue business. More operators are planning to sell buses as there have been huge losses and driving at 50% occupancy for schools as per new SOP was “not feasible”. “It is doomsday for us as the business is quietly shutting down and we have shortage of buses and drivers,” said Anil Garg of SBOA. Another senior SBOA member said that the government had turned a blind eye to the demands made by the association, which included financial packages for drivers and attendants. Nearly 8,000 attendants in Mumbai were without pay for 18 months, and now with schools reopening, some of them expect to get back in the buses. The drivers who migrated to BEST or private tourist buses now earn a minimum Rs 24,000 per month and this helps them take care of their families.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-better-pay-lures-school-bus-drivers-to-switch-to-best/articleshow/87213927.cms||Somit Sen

Every year, they hold traditional ballets to narrate the story of the Ramayana,” the CM said while speaking at an official programme to dedicate a four-volume publication titled ‘Bhartiya Bhashaon Mein Ram’, brought out by the Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan. The CM said whatever people received from Ram was the reflection of how they saw and interacted with the lord. “Take the example of Valmiki who chanted Ram with reverence and wrote the Ramayana. Demon Mareech remembered Ram antagonistically and ended up dying like an animal. Lord Hanuman committed himself to the service of Ram and received unparalleled admiration. Ravan nursed enmity with the lord and became a synonym of evil,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ram-is-universally-embraced-as-icon-of-indianness-cm/articleshow/87214544.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Farmers alleged that they were visiting for DAP for many days, but could not find any. Some of them claimed that they were standing in queue since morning waiting for their turn, but farmers with political influence received more DAP. Later, police reached the spot and pacified the agitated farmers. Cooperative society salesman Jagdish Prasad said on Thursday 1,000 bags were received and there were 500 farmers standing in the queue. It was a big challenge to identify the farmers, he said. A demand for 10,000 metric tonnes had been sent from the district, but only 1,300 MT has reached. Though, the state is advising farmers to use a mixture of urea-single super phosphate, but farmers prefer DAP. A farmer said that they were forced to visit the Kray Vikray Sahakari and Gram Seva Sahakari Samitis for DAP daily. When the supply reached, there was a crowd of farmers at the centres. He said farmers were being given five bags of DAP through biometric entries using Aadhaar cards, but many farmers were distributed more DAP. Within 4-5 hours, stocks were over and the next consignment was expected in the next 4-5 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh said he was unable to sow crops due to lack of fertilisers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/barmer-farmers-fight-over-fertiliser-distribution/articleshow/87213953.cms||---

Most of Bardez’s coastal belt and Sal and Latambarcem in Bicholim were left dependent on tanker supply. Meanwhile, work of repair of the breach in the Tillari canal at Maneri in Dodamarg, Maharashtra, has only just begun. The breach in the canal has drastically reduced the water being supplied to the Assonora water treatment plant. Officials said that it will take at least three days for the repair work to be completed. Even after the repairs are carried out, it takes some time for the water supply network to normalise and for the supply to be restored, including to the tail-ends. The Assonora treatment plant is only dependent on raw water from Amthane reservoir at present, and water to the dam is being pumped from the rivers. This has prevented the entire Bardez taluka from going without supply so far, as it was initially expected. Most parts were provided supply on Thursday and Friday, though for reduced hours. But the tail-ends of Calangute, Anjuna, Nerul were severely affected. “It has been six months, we are getting irregular water supply in Anjuna. There have been days when we have been left in tears due to this suffering. For days on end we have been left entirely dependent on tanker water supply. The panchayat, PWD JE...no one hears our pleas,” said an Anjuna local.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bardez-bicholim-rely-on-tankers-for-water-supply/articleshow/87214613.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP: Court orders FIR against 11 cops for sending 3 of family to jail over false 'honour killing' case||BIJNOR: Over two-and-a-half years after a 15-year-old girl went missing in UP’s Amroha and three of her family members were later charged with “honour killing” and thrown in jail, a local court has ordered an FIR against 11 policemen after the minor was found alive, pregnant and living with her lover-turned-husband. The girl had disappeared from her home in a village that falls under the jurisdiction of Adampur police station in February 2019. Police had claimed to have recovered her clothes and a country-made pistol near Ganga. Consequently, the girl's father, brother and a relative were sent to jail in December for allegedly shooting the girl and throwing her body in Ganga. Last year, however, the girl was found alive and living with her partner — who she said was now her husband — in a neighbouring village. Soon after, police arrested the girl’s partner, Rajesh Kumar, for abduction and rape of a minor. The then Amroha superintendent of police, Vipin Tada, had instituted a departmental inquiry into the matter and suspended the station house officer of Adampur. The girl’s family members were released on bail and filed an FIR against her partner and police for allegedly framing them. They also approached the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court for justice. On Thursday, the court ordered an FIR against 11 cops — including the then station house officer Ashok Sharma, four sub-inspectors and six constables — and ordered an inquiry into the matter. Father of the girl had also made allegations against the then superintendent of police, the circle officer and the sub-divisional magistrate as well, but the court noted that there was lack of evidence against them and only the investigation team was held responsible.

As a nine-year-old at the Real Madrid academy, the SC East Bengal coach remembers being handed a ticket to watch the El Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu. The atmosphere left a lasting impression. “Every Clasico that Real Madrid has won is etched in memory. Barcelona victories are wiped away,” the former Real Madrid reserve team manager told TOI ahead of Sundays El Clasico, the first in front of spectators in more than 18 months. Heading into the game, Real Madrid are natural favourites. Barcelona have endured a catastrophic summer and their performances on the field haven’t really been encouraging. Two points separate the eternal rivals after eight matches, but form will count for little at the Camp Nou on Sunday. “Real Madrid and Barcelona have had ups and downs all these years, but one thing has remained constant: the Clasico is a special match and there are never any favourites. You never know what can happen. Real Madrid, though, is a better team,” said the 53-year-old Spaniard. This will be the first clash between the two giants since the departure of Lionel Messi to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Since then, Barcelona’s performances have dipped and the pressure on coach Ronald Koeman has increased. “Barcelona is a very, very good team but they now have serious problems, both on and off the field,” said Manolo. “Messi’s exit is the biggest problem for the club. Barca will need some time, maybe in two or three years they will bounce back.” This season is the first since 2007 that Real Madrid and Barcelona do not have either Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi as part of their clubs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/el-clasico-real-madrid-is-a-better-team-barcelona-have-serious-problems-says-manolo-diaz/articleshow/87230724.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Now, get it reconstructed with own cells at KGMU||LUCKNOW: Patients suffering from decay of tooth bone will soon be able to get it treated through stem cell implant in the dental faculty of King George's Medical University (KGMU). A stem cell lab is being constructed in the oral pathology and microbiology department and soon a CO2 incubator machine will be installed in it. The machine will be able to preserve stem cells taken out from the decayed tooth bone and multiply them through incubation. The cluster of cells thus obtained would be then used to reconstruct the tooth bone and in root canal therapy. So far, patients whose teeth are extensively damaged have to either use dentures or get metallic implants. The stem therapy will provide patients another option of getting the tooth bone reconstructed with their own cells. The stem cells incubated in the lab can also be used in other patients provided they match certain medical parameters required for such implants. Head oral pathology and microbiology department Prof Shaleen Chandra said, “The construction of the lab will be completed within a week. Thereafter, the incubation machine procured through state government aid will be installed. The machine provides a stable environment designed to mimic a cell’s natural environment that is ideal for stem cell growth.” “Dental stem cells obtained from naturally lost or surgically removed teeth can be incubated in the machine and used for dental treatment. To use stem cells exacted from a person in another, the human leukocytes antigens (HLA) of the two must match. The HLA are proteins in the human immune system that play a crucial role in accepting or rejecting an implant,” he added. This will be the second CO2 incubator machine in KGMU. A unit is already functional at the Centre for Advanced Research. However, it would be used for the first time in any dental education institution in Lucknow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/tooth-bone-decay-now-get-it-reconstructed-with-own-cells/articleshow/87214571.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

In a statement, Sisodia later said, getting 100 crore vaccines administered in this country was a big deal, and for this, the medical teams and administration worked hard. “While it is a big deal to achieve this goal, but there is also the question as to why it was delayed due to the policies of the Government of India?” he added. The deputy CM alleged that, in a country where two vaccines had started to be manufactured, for a long time the Centre ignored the fact that the people of India needed the vaccines too. He said, when the history of these 100 crore vaccines would be written, the question would also arise why did it take so long to vaccinate people when the country had the vaccine and the central government kept sending them abroad. Sisodia claimed that while it was good that the Centre had patted itself in the back, but it should also take responsibility that because of its policies and greed to keep donating their vaccines to foreign countries, there had also been a delay of six months in administering vaccines in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/could-have-hit-100cr-target-6-mths-ago-if-vax-not-sent-abroad/articleshow/87213956.cms||---

Aayush Dudhiya has made the documentary in a 360-degree stereoscopic format, to be experienced on a virtual reality (VR) headset. In August 2021, Aayush and a friend, headed to a remote trans-Himalayan village 70km from Leh, at an altitude of 14,000 feet, where a community of six families coexists with the big cat. The film is told through the eyes of Morup Namgail, a 26-year-old filmmaker from the village, who is also an expert snow leopard tracker. It immerses the viewer in the journey of filming and photographing the big cat using camera traps, narrating a complex tale of man-animal co-existence and the issues that threaten the region. With an MA in documentary production (2018) from Bristol, Aayush is currently pursuing an MA in Virtual and Extended Realities and the film is part of his study project. “My objective as a filmmaker and a communicator is to use my skills, knowledge and love for the cinematic medium to educate people and bridge their gap with the natural world with utmost sincerity,” he says. Spotting a snow leopard in the wild has never been easy. Of his 20-day filming schedule for the project, Aayush dedicated 15 days to camera trapping. “We hiked seven times during our time there, with the hope that a cat had chosen the route we placed the cameras along but did not get any success,” he says. On the last day, before the last hike of the schedule, Aayush, while scrolling through images, saw a whitish-grey mammal in the frame. It was a snow leopard!||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/youth-makes-vr-film-on-snow-leopards/articleshow/87213943.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Delhi||Call on Chhath Puja at DDMA meet on October 27||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is likely to take a decision on permission for Chhath Puja celebrations in the city in a meeting to be chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on October 27. The authority had prohibited celebrations of Chhath Puja at public places on September 30 for the second year in a row in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written a letter to Baijal on October 14 to convene a meeting of DDMA to allow celebrations in the capital with all necessary Covid-19 protocols in place. Kejriwal had said that Chhath Puja should be allowed as the Covid-19 situation has been under control in the national capital and many other states have allowed the celebrations. In the letter, Kejriwal had stated that the people of Delhi celebrate Chhath every year with faith and the festival is an integral part of our ancient culture. Apart from the LG and CM, Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, chief secretary Vijay Dev and other senior government officials would be present in the meeting to be held through videoconferencing on Wednesday. Earlier, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had also written a letter to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, seeking guidelines for the festival. Bharatiya Janata Party MP Manoj Tiwari has been demanding permission for Chhath Puja in the capital since September 30. Tiwari had also started a ‘Chhath Yatra’ to mobilise support for revoking the ban.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/call-on-chhath-puja-at-ddma-meet-on-oct-27/articleshow/87213966.cms||---

The question papers for the ongoing unit test for Class 9 to Class 12 students have been prepared by GSHSEB. The paper is likely to have been leaked from a school in Gandhinagar, said sources aware of the development. The education department has ordered an inquiry into the matter. The unit test for Class 9 to Class 12 students across the state started on October 18 and will end on October 27. In the case of self-financed schools, GSHSEB had allowed them the option to set their own exam papers. “The board had sent papers to the DEOs in sealed covers in advance. But, on Friday, it came to light that many students had acquired the question papers before the exams began,” said sources. When the education department got to know about the issue, it took matters in its hands and began inquiry, sources further said. “The paper has been leaked after it left the DEO offices and reached the school principals. Investigation is on about how and where exactly it got leaked,” said sources. Recently, there were complaints about a paper being leaked in Dehgam at a photo copy centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/class-10-paper-leak-education-dept-begins-inquiry/articleshow/87213961.cms||---

The arrested accused were identified as Sonu Kanujiya (22) and his aide Chandan Chauhan (20), both natives of Deoria but residents of Aashiana. The victim was abducted on September 24 from near Bijli Pasi Kila. SHO Aashiana Brajendra Kumar Mishra said that on September 25, the victim’s father informed police that his minor daughter, a student of BSc (first year), had gone missing after the college. “I had gone to drop my daughter to college on September 24 around 10.40am and then to pick her up around 1.45pm. However, she was neither at school nor at any of her friends’ house,” said the girl’s father. Mishra said that the accused knew the girl from Deoria and had lured her for a trip to Delhi. “We were working on the case and based on surveillance, tracked their location near Alambagh. The duo was probably trying to extort money from the victim’s father. A team was sent and they were nabbed,” said Mishra. The girl in her statement said that she was also raped by one of the accused. “Her statements will be recorded in front of a magistrate,” said Mishra. On the basis of her statements, an FIR of rape, kidnapping, and under Protection of Children frpm Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) has been filed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/abducted-teen-girl-rescued/articleshow/87214604.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The petition in this regard was filed by Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, Rajasthan. In a letter to the principal secretaries/secretaries of all states and union territories, the director of the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (Divyangjan), KVS Rao, stated, “I am directed to forward herewith a copy of the representation received from Hemant Bhai Goyal, deputy chairperson, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh Rajasthan, which is self-explanatory for appropriate action.” “You are requested to look into the matter and action deemed appropriate may be taken to address these issues raised by the applicant. Action in this regard may be intimated directly to the applicant,” it added. Earlier, the state government had allowed nominating PwDs to the urban local bodies as members across the state. The state government had amended the Rajasthan Municipal Act in March this year to introduce this provision of nominating PwDs to the ULBs as members, making it the first in the country. After amendments in the Rajasthan Municipal Act, now it has become mandatory to keep one post vacant for PwDs in an urban local body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/ensure-giving-4-quota-for-people-with-disabilities-in-local-body-polls/articleshow/87213965.cms||---

The police had gone to the village to stop an unauthorised panchayat poll campaign. At least 20 police personnel were also injured in heavy stone pelting by the villagers. While Dhanarua circle inspector Ram Kumar suffered a fracture in his leg, SHO Raju Kumar and constable received head injuries. The villager who died in police firing was identified as Rohit Choudhary (25). “Bijendra Kumar (30), Neeraj Kumar (29) and Milan Kumar (30) received bullet injuries,” said one Upendra Kumar of the village. The injured villagers were admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital. Panchayat election at Mauriyawa is scheduled to take place in the fifth phase on October 24. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, however, said it would be premature to say that Rohit died due to police firing. “We have begun an investigation into the incident,” he added. The SSP, however, admitted that the police and the villagers had exchanged fire. The SSP said trouble began when the police tried to stop electioneering and an orchestra programme organised by a mukhiya candidate, Surendra Sah, at the village after 5pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/one-killed-three-injured-in-police-firing/articleshow/87213838.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The protesters said that the pipeline ruptures very frequently causing immense hardships to the public. “When all and sundry are aware that this pipeline bursts very frequently at different locations along the line, they have failed to even propose the work for replacement of this line. This speaks about the actual development that takes place in Margao,” Coutinho said. Opposition leader and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat also visited the site in the morning along with PWD engineers and instructed them to ensure that the restoration work is completed at the earliest. “All the connections from the old water pipeline will be shifted to the new pipeline and residents will start getting water by this evening,” Kamat said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/locals-upset-over-colmorod-water-woes/articleshow/87214656.cms||---

Talking to TOI, Husain said, “I appeal to the Union government to amend CAA to accommodate all victims of Taliban brutality in India, irrespective of their religious beliefs. The killing of Mahajabi Hakimi by Taliban is a cowardly act.

---||Lucknow||Govt teachers decry duty in ‘paath’, waste collection||Lucknow: Associations of teachers have decried engaging government teachers in works other than teaching. The resentment came after teachers in Kasganj were engaged in organising Valmiki Ramayan ‘paath’ at Sankat Mochan Dham on the occasion of Maharshi Valmiki Jayanti. In Firozabad, teachers have been asked to collect plastic waste and deposit it in the nyaya panchayat building. Opposing the involvement of teachers in non-academic tasks, teachers associations said they are already burdened with the massive data feeding exercise for the direct benefits transfer scheme for purchase of uniforms, sweaters, shoes, socks and school bags for government school children. “Why rope in teachers for work that affects their dignity. Even if its a religious event, the duties assigned should be optional,” said Vinay Singh, state president of UP Teacher Trained Graduate Association. Demanding action against officers for issuing such orders, state president of Uttar Pradeshiya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh Susheel Pandey said, “This is not the first time teachers are involved in demeaning works. We have verbally discussed the matter with the basic education minister and will submit a representation when he is back to Lucknow after October 25.” Pramendra Shukla, the state head of BEOs, said, “The order on plastic waste is so unclear. If it is addressed to BEO, then it is obvious that teachers will collect the plastic waste.” The resentment from teachers came following an order issued by the chief development officer (CDO) Kasganj. Teachers from primary and upper primary schools were put on duty for Valmiki Ramayan paath. Each teacher was assigned a four-hour duty. CDO Kasganj Tej Pratap Mishra said Ramayan path was held on October 20-21. “It was not compulsory duty. If teachers had a problem, they should have reported. Teachers were engaged as they are considered capable,” Mishra said. In another order on October 20, basic shiksha adhikari of Firozabad Anjali Agarwal directed BEOs to ensure collection of 1000kg plastic waste from each school. “Under Swachh Bharat Mission, the basic education department has been given the task of collecting plastic waste,” Agarwal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/govt-teachers-decry-duty-in-paath-waste-collection/articleshow/87214660.cms||Isha Jain
---||Mumbai||BMC likely to relax Covid bed rules for private hospitals||MUMBAI: With Covid-19 cases dropping in the city, there are indications that the BMC may relax the 80:20 rule that mandates private hospitals to charge only government rates for 80% of its Covid beds. In several cases, hospitals may also be allowed to do away with some Covid wards so that non-Covid patients get better access to healthcare, said sources in the public health department. The Association of Hospitals is likely to take up the issue for discussion with BMC officials at the forthcoming meeting this month-end. A civic official said the corporation is likely to issue a notification next week that would only need hospitals to reserve 50% of their Covid-19 beds at government rates. “If hospitals have separate entrances, then they will also be allowed to reduce the number of Covid beds for the time being till the third wave occurs,” said the official. When contacted, the BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said no decision has yet been taken with respect to private hospitals. The BMC itself, though, has decided to put on hold its plan to open up its four newly constructed field hospitals. A private hospital administrator said, “It’s time we could also reduce our Covid beds so that our non-Covid patients can get beds more easily.” Dr V Ravishankar, COO of Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, said the hospital still had 198 Covid beds, even though only 24 are occupied. “We have had to delay operations for non-Covid as a result,” he said. Another administrator said the BMC should designate a few centrally located private hospitals to keep Covid beds and wards and let others carry on with non-Covid work. Joy Chakraborthy of Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said as his hospital has dedicated a whole building for Covid, the question of obstruction for non-Covid operations doesn’t arise. The Maharashtra government had reduced reservation of Covid beds at private hospitals from 80% to 50% and that too on the condition that the hospitals would scale up bed reservation once there is a surge in Covid cases. This reduction was done based on an order issued on September 1 considering the rising number of monsoon-related ailments in the state. Officials from the state government said that more than 15 districts in the state which have less than 100 active cases and Covid beds are lying vacant. Even in cities, most cases are getting treated at home and a very small percentage of Covid patients need hospitalization. “There is demand from many hospitals to have a need-based policy for reservation of beds for Covid-19 patients. It is likely that a review may be taken post Diwali as a spike is expected post the festive season,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-likely-to-relax-covid-bed-rules-for-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/87213978.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Sales of Covid-19 drugs plunge||AHMEDABAD: With the Covid-19 cases plummeting steeply across the state and remaining in double digit for the past few months, the sales of drugs — favipiravir and remdesivir — used in the treatment of Covid-19 have also plunged drastically. Vitamins, sanitizers and immunity boosters’ sales too have dropped in line with the reduction in Covid cases.  The sales of remdesivir across the state have declined to 1,680 vials in so far in October as against the record sale of 3.49 lakh injections in April. The antiviral drug’s monthly sales skyrocketed above 1 lakh vials during March to May, when the fierce second wave of the pandemic gripped the state and the entire nation. The remdesivir sales in October are the lowest after June 2020, shows data compiled by the Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration. Meanwhile, the oral antiviral drug favipiravir’s sales too have touched their lowest levels since the outbreak of the pandemic. About 408 tablets of favipiravir 200mg have been sold so far in October as against the record sales of 34.47 lakh tablets in April this year. The sales of favipiravir in 400mg and 800mg dosages have also nosedived to 780 tablets and 612 tablets, respectively, in October. In April, the 400 mg pills’ sales had galloped to 1 crore tablets and 800 mg pills to 14.45 lakh tablets, the state FDCA data further showed. “The sales of remdesivir and favipiravir have dropped to negligible levels, which is inline with the sharp reduction in cases of Covid-19 across the state,” said Dr HG Koshia, commissioner, FDCA-Gujarat. The sales of Covid drugs have been steadily decreasing since June 2021, according to state FDCA compiled data. “With more vaccination, cases have surely gone down. People are now more confident after vaccination and therefore, consumption of immunity boosters has reduced. As long as people wear masks in public places, things may remain under control,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president, Ahmedabad Hospitals’ & Nursing homes’ Association (AHNA). “The sale of preventive and immunity-boosting medicines has completely taken a back seat. While mask sales continue, demand for sanitizers has drastically dropped too. People are getting complacent with the situation and therefore, spending on Covid-related medicines has reduced drastically. This trend has been observed since July this year,” said Ankur Aggarwal, founder, MedKart.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sales-of-covid-19-drugs-plunge/articleshow/87214022.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Mumbai||Life expectancy in India dips by 2 years amid pandemic, says report||MUMBAI: Life expectancy in India has dropped by roughly two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a statistical analysis by scientists from the International Institute for Population Studies, Deonar. “Life expectancy at birth for men and women has declined from 69.5 years and 72 years in 2019 to 67.5 years and 69.8 years respectively in 2020,” said IIPS assistant professor Surayakant Yadav whose work was published in the medical journal ‘BMC Public Health’ on Thursday. ‘Life expectancy at birth’ refers to the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of his/her birth remain constant in the future. The new study also looked at ‘length of life inequality’ (the variation in length of life within populations), and found the Covid toll among men in the 35-69 age group was the highest. “The 35–79 age group had excess deaths caused by Covid in 2020 compared to normal years and it is this group that has contributed immensely to the drop,’’ said the author. The IIPS study was conducted to study the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic on mortality patterns in the country. Across the world, Covid-19 has resulted in excess deaths in comparison to previous years. According to the Union health ministry, 4.5 lakh people died due to Covid-19 since March 2020, but data specialists estimate that millions have died due to the pandemic in India. The IIPS study used data collated by the 145-nation Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study as well as Covid-India Application Programming Interface (API) portal for the analysis. The study found that India was right in the middle as far as the impact on mortality is concerned as compared to India’s 2-year drop, life expectancy at birth dropped more than one year in the US, England and Wales and 2.28 years in Spain. “The Covid impact has wiped out the progress we made in the last decade to increase the life expectancy figure,” said Yadav. India’s life expectancy at birth now is the same as it was in 2010. “It will take us years to catch up,’’ he added. However, IIPS director Dr K S James said many epidemics have in the past had an impact on life expectancy at birth figures. “It is a dynamic figure that keeps changing every year. In Africa, life expectancy dropped drastically due to the HIV-AIDS epidemic, but recouped in a few years,’’ said James. An expert, who didn’t want to be named, said a drop of two years is high if one considers the central health ministry’s Covid toll figures. “If the case fatality rate was higher at 3 or more as suggested by individual statisticians, only then does the drop seem fine,’’ he added. The Covid-19 pandemic has negative repercussions on life expectancy and inequality in age at death and has slowed the mortality transition in India. However, Yadav said that India would have to make huge investments in health to rein in the lead killers heart and lung disease and road traffic accidents in order to improve life expectancy at birth within a few years. “If not, the improvement could take a decade.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-life-expectancy-dips-by-2-years-amid-pandemic-says-report/articleshow/87213973.cms||Malathy Iyer

The plea sought the court’s intervention and a direction to the authorities not to force him to get vaccinated for Covid, arguing that the teacher suffered from some ailment and inoculation might worsen the medical condition. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to Delhi government and asked it to reply to the petition and listed the matter for hearing in February next year. The petitioner, who is a teacher at a government school, challenged Delhi government’s order making it mandatory for all school staff to be vaccinated for Covid-19 by October 15, failing which they would not be allowed to attend school and their absence would be treated as “on leave”. The petitioner said he was diagnosed with hand dystonia in 2018 and allopathic treatment did not show any signs of improvement, instead his condition worsened. He added that, on August 31, he was served with a show cause notice from the head of the school as to why he had not gotten himself vaccinated and asked to state the reason. In response, the teacher submitted that, according to the central government guidelines, vaccination was voluntary and not mandatory and requested the authorities not to compel him for the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-seeks-delhi-govts-response-on-teachers-plea-on-vaccination/articleshow/87213975.cms||---

The police later arrested the shopkeeper and his assistant and booked them under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and section 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC. The father of the girl, a farmer, said, "My daughter had gone to buy samosas but the owner of the shop -- Rakesh Kumar -- made false allegations and tied her hands and feet to a cart. When some people tried to intervene, they were threatened by his assistant Mahesh Singh.” Sarvesh Mishra, additional superintendent of police, said, “The treatment meted out to the child by these adults was uncalled for. The two culprits have been arrested.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/girl-7-tied-to-cart-for-stealing-rs-20-2-arrested/articleshow/87213174.cms||Sandeep Rai

The doctor fled the scene soon after the incident came to light.  The deceased's kin alleged that doctors sold his kidney and that they were not told about the operation. The hospital administration was booked under sections 18 and 20 of the Organ Transplant Act 1994. Bulandshahr CMO Vineet Kumar has ordered a probe, and the hospital was sealed. According to the police complaint filed by the family of deceased Yusuf Ahmad, 45, he had no other ailment apart from low platelet count because of which he was admitted. There are reports that it was a case of changed identity as Ahmad's namesake was suffering from kidney and gallbladder-related issues. SHO Sanjeev Kumar confirmed that a case of medical negligence has been reported at a private hospital where a patient died after he was wrongly operated upon. "The kin of the patient created a ruckus at the hospital after which police reached at the spot and the body was sent for the post-mortem. The sections of murder will be added in the FIR after the autopsy report arrives. The postmortem report will confirm if the allegations of missing organs are true or not," said the SHO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/kidney-surgery-done-on-patient-with-low-platelet-count-dies/articleshow/87213181.cms||---

The portal, said Patel, should resolve issues in a time-bound manner. She also said students should be involved in various committees instituted for functioning of universities. Patel, who was viewing the NAAC presentation prepared by Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, said universities should adopt 30% syllabus under the NEP based on local needs. The universities, said Patel, should create their research policy and upload it on their websites. The document should provide details of all facilities to be provided to students undertaking research. Patel advised universities to undertake research on feedback on various government (Centre and state) schemes. Patel said that around 30% of the beneficiaries are not eligible for government schemes. To combat this, we need to know the reasons and provide solutions, she said. She added that for transparent and quality research work, universities should make optimum use of the Shodhganga portal. The governor also stressed upon development of smart class and conduct of online classes. She said universities should address the drawbacks pointed out by the NAAC committees in past. She also asked universities to keep track of outdoor activities, hold alumni meets and sign agreements with industries for generating employment. She added that universities should make their students visit jails, old age homes, child care homes and hospitals under extra-curricular activities for their personal growth. The governor also batted for transparency in appointments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/create-portal-for-students-grievances-guv-to-univs/articleshow/87214685.cms||---

The state saw one of its worst sectarian clashes in September that year which claimed the lives of 60 people and displaced nearly 50,000. According to additional district counsel (ADGC) Narender Sharma, "A case under sections 147, 425, 427, 504, 506 of IPC had been registered at Jansath police station, and the trial was being heard by special MP-MLA court judge Gopal Upadhyay. All the 12 accused have been acquitted because the witness in the case turned hostile during the trial." Defence lawyer Bharatveer Ahlawat said, "The court examined all the evidence and after hearing arguments of both the sides passed its order acquitting the 12 accused." Ahlawat added, "The court acquitted accused Rakesh Saini, Tikam, Deepak, Ravi, Sonu, Ankit Vipin, Pawan, Jagpal and Ramkishan, including MLA Vikram Saini, due to lack of evidence." On August 27, 2013, there was a ruckus in Kawal village under Jansath police station jurisdiction after the murders of Shahnawaz and two other youths, Sachin and Gaurav (both cousins). A mob then set ablaze a Tata-207 parked in the village. After the incident, Abdul Razzaq, son of watchman Ishtiaq had filed a case against 12 people, including Vikram Saini, who was a local BJP functionary during those days. This came even as on Tuesday, a sessions court in Muzaffarnagar acquitted 20 people in connection with the murder and loot of their neighbour in Lank village during the 2013 riots. Abul Hasan, 62, was alone in his house in Phugana of Muzaffarnagar when a mob broke into his house and shot at him and later slit his throat. The mob committed robbery before setting the house on fire. Abdul's son Dilshad Ali named 12 men of his village, including several unknown attackers. An FIR was filed at Fugana police station under various sections, including 396 (murder during dacoity), of IPC. Later, police booked eight more people in the case. During the course of the trial, four witnesses turned hostile. "Hence, the court acquitted the accused," said defence lawyer Rampal Singh Grade. "The case was being heard in the court of additional district judge 7," he added. These are not the only cases in which the accused have been acquitted due to lack of evidence or due to witnesses turning hostile. A court in Muzaffarnagar in September 2021 acquitted 21 accused as all the witnesses in the case turned hostile. The case was filed by one Sirajuddin, a resident of Kutbi village, who alleged that on September 8, 2013, a mob had set his house on fire, attempted to kill the family and then robbed them of their valuables. The case was filed in Shahpur police station. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) had probed this case and filed a charge sheet against 21 people. One of the accused had died during the pendency of the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/muzaffarnagar-riots-mla-among-12-acquitted-in-arson-case/articleshow/87213185.cms||Mohd Dilshad

According to ZP CEO Y Naveen Bhat, the initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission has received widespread public support. “We have launched the ‘Namma Ooru, Swachh Ooru’ campaign to completely rid the district of garbage black spots. We have already cleared more than 150 black spots with the help of the public, where garbage was dumped on the sides of roads, near bus stops, and along rivers. We received information on 55 garbage black spots in the district through the WhatsApp number 9483330564. Meanwhile, nearly 100 black spots have been identified by gram panchayats. The majority of the identified black spots have been cleared in order to develop gardens by planting flower and fruit saplings. In addition, CCTV cameras and signboards prohibiting garbage disposal in public places have been installed. Gardens have been developed in a number of locations in the village panchayats of Koteshwara, Kodibettu, and Bommarabettu,” said the CEO. Gram panchayats have also imposed fines of Rs 2,000 on those who violate the rules and dump waste in public places, he said. “Kodibettu and Alevoor gram panchayats have been conducting regular drives to find violators and, in some cases, people have been ordered to clear the area where they dumped waste, in addition to penalties,” he informed. The ZP has launched a campaign encouraging people to share information on black spots as well as photos and videos of violators dumping waste. “Those who share information about people dumping waste in public places will be appropriately rewarded. We will not reveal the names or other personal details of such informers,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/turning-garbage-black-spots-into-gardens/articleshow/87213009.cms||---

Not only this, after staying with the dancer as a partner for some time, the ‘dholak’ player escaped with the earnings from performances. On the written complaint of the victim, police registered a case against the ‘dholak’ player under various sections, including theft and under SC/ST Act. A search has been launched for the ‘dholak’ player, police said. As per the complaint, the victim was a DJ dancer. In June 2020, the victim met ‘dholak’ player Mohd Mumtaz and on the lure of getting more money, he went to Delhi with him. In Delhi, Mumtaz allegedly gave some medicines in food to the victim due to which the dancer became infirm. Mumtaz then took him to a hospital, where after regaining consciousness, he found that his sex has been changed and he had become a woman. Mumtaz then made him perform dances in Delhi. He usurped all his earnings and after living in Delhi as a couple for some time, they returned to Gorakhpur. When the dancer went to Mumtaz’s village he found that Mumtaz was married and had children. When he tried to lodge a police complaint against Mumtaz, he was threatened by the latter. The dancer in his complaint has mentioned that Mumtaz has run away with his (Mumtaz) wife and children. He has also taken Rs 10 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 4 lakh earned through dance performances. “On the basis of the complaint, we have registered a case under 18 sections.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Confusion over K Chandrasekhar Rao’s public rally as EC extends model code to near districts||HYDERABAD: With the Election Commission of India (ECI) deciding to extend the model code of conduct to neighbouring districts of Huzurabad assembly constituency, the TRS is on the horns of a dilemma on holding public meetings even as the by-election is nearing. Though no decision has been taken on the public meetings to be addressed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, TRS working president KT Rama Rao termed the ECI’s decision as “strange and objectionable.” The TRS had earlier decided to hold KCR’s public meeting at Penchikalpet in Husnabad constituency in Siddipet district on October 27. Penchikalpet is a good 80 km away from Huzurabad. However, with the ECI’s latest decision, the TRS may not hold the meeting in the neighbouring Siddipet district, party sources said. As per the ECI’s Covid-19 norms, parties cannot hold a meeting with not more than 1,000 people. As the rule became a sticking point to hold a public meeting with thousands of people, KCR reportedly discussed the matter with senior leaders. Sources said the TRS chief was even mulling whether to hold a public meeting in the first place, given the ECI’s stringent norms. Some leaders suggested to him to conduct roadshows in Huzurabad constituency instead of a public meeting. There were also suggestions to organise a public meeting in nearby Medak district by transporting people in buses. Till now, ministers T Harish Rao and Gangula Kamalakar and senior party leaders like B Vinod Kumar have been campaigning for party candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav. Neither KCR nor KTR has addressed a single rally or meeting in support of Yadav. KTR said the ECI’s move will become a precedent in the next elections also.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/confusion-over-kcrs-public-rally-as-ec-extends-model-code-to-near-dists/articleshow/87213992.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: After 35 years, Kutch desert sanctuary to get borders||RAJKOT: How long does it take for the wheels of government machinery to move after declaring a forest land as protected? Almost 35 years in the case of the Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary. It was declared as a wildlife sanctuary in February 1986. But the process of marking exact area of the sanctuary has been initiated by the Kutch district collector office now. On Thursday, additional collector J M Parmar, through a notification, started a survey and settlement process — the first step to earmark the protected area. The notification has given two months to people having residential or commercial interest in the sanctuary area to raise objections. As per norms, the revenue department carries out the process of marking the area of a sanctuary. It also undertakes the acquisition of land and land right settlement process. For the Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, spread over 7,500 square kilometres, the process has been initiated after almost 35 years. The additional collector has declared the land survey numbers of Bhuj, Bhachau and Rapar talukas that fall under sanctuary area and also the names of the villages. The statement also invited objections within two months in accordance with the wildlife protection act so as to complete the survey settlement process. Forest officials said that till the sanctuary area is not properly earmarked by the revenue department, it’s difficult to relocate people living inside the sanctuary or force closure of any commercial or industrial activity within its area. Assistant conservator of forest Kutch (east) H J Thakkar said, “Revenue officer works as a settlement officer. Two officers are appointed for this process in the sanctuary area and we are trying to complete this process as soon as possible using all available resources.” The famous ‘Flamingo City’ — the nesting ground of flamingos and nearly 250 other species of migratory birds — is situated inside the sanctuary. Also, the area falls under the Central Asian Flyway, a migration route used by birds living across different continents. Apart from birds, the sanctuary has a significant population of wild ass and other animals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/after-35-yrs-kutch-desert-sanctuary-to-get-borders/articleshow/87213022.cms||---

Dr Madi said that the patient testing positive for the novel coronavirus, if treated using the anti-body cocktail therapy when still in the preliminary stage of the infection, would not need to hospitalisation. “This treatment will help prevent the patient’s condition from deteriorating,” he added. He added that the anti-body cocktail could be used in the form of post-exposure prophylaxis for adults, in whom the chances of the infection progressing were high. “This will help patients not fully vaccinated mount an adequate immune response. However, the therapy is no substitute for the Covid vaccination,” Dr Madi said. Pointing to the promising results they had achieved using the therapy, Dr Madi added, “It has helped lower the number of patients requiring hospitalisation, and reduce fatality by nearly 70%. It has also pushed the duration of the symptoms to just four days in the case of patients, in whom the infection is mild. The therapy has reduced risk of symptomatic infection by nearly 81% when used in post-exposure prophylaxis treatment among those who share the same house as the Covid patient.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/cocktail-therapy-offering-promising-results-in-treatment-of-covid-19/articleshow/87212942.cms||---
---||Patna||Bodh Gaya blast: Six terrorists plead guilty||PATNA: Six of the nine terrorists who were arrested in connection with the 2018 Bodh Gaya blast case confessed to their involvement in the terror act by filing a joint petition in the special NIA court here on Friday. The terrorists are already facing trial in the case being investigated by the NIA. None of them had pleaded guilty when the charges were framed against them earlier. The six accused who filed the joint petition are Ahmad Ali alias Kalu, Nur Alam Momin, Mohammad Adil Sheikh, Abdul Karim, Musfafizur Rehman and Arif Hussain. Mohammad Paigambar Sheikh, Dilawar Hossain and a Bangladeshi national, Mohammad Jehidul Islam, didn’t file any petition. A low-intensity IED blast had taken place below a generator set near Kalchakra ground in Bodh Gaya on January 19, 2018, when Buddhist spiritual guru Dalai Lama was also in the town. Within hours of the blast, security forces had recovered three more IEDs from gate number four of Mahabodhi temple and in front of a Sri Lankan monastery. Dalai Lama was staying in a Tibetan monastery located near the Sri Lankan monaster. As per NIA chargesheet, the terror plot was hatched to avenge alleged atrocities on Rohingyas in Myanmar. Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), a terror organisation banned by MHA, had allegedly planned the blasts. Jehidul, one of the arrested terrorists, had links with JMB which was trying to establish its roots in India. The accused filed the joint petition hours after they were produced in the NIA court after being brought to Patna from West Bengal via train. Since it is a voluntary confession, the court may show leniency as the terrorists wish to join the mainstream of the society again. The nine terrorists were also accused in the Burdwan blast case. They had also been charged with committing robberies for funding JMB’s terror network in Bengaluru. Both cases are with NIA. After production before NIA court, the nine terrorists were taken to Beur central jail amid tight security. The NIA court has fixed November 22 as the next date of hearing in the case. Special public prosecutor (NIA) Lallan Prasad Sinha said they have received a copy of the joint petition filed by the six terrorists. “We will study the petition. Nothing more can be disclosed at this moment,” he added. The NIA had filed a chargesheet against six of the accused on September 27, 2018 followed by a supplementary chargesheet against the remaining three on January 28, 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bodh-gaya-blast-six-terrorists-plead-guilty/articleshow/87213831.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The prevention of crime branch (PCB) sleuths said that they have evidence that the father, who works as a labourer in Surat, forced his daughter into flesh trade. “We had received a tip-off that a prostitution racket was being run at a residential tower on Waghodia Road following which we raided the spot late on Thursday night. We nabbed a lady who ran the racket, an agent and three customers from the spot,” said Jatin Patel, PCB police inspector. “Among the seven females who were rescued, one was a 12-year-old girl. She told us that her father was in Surat so we contacted him. During investigations, we came across the girl’s Whatsapp chats with her father. In the chats, the father, who is a casual labourer, was asking her to send the money that she had earned from prostitution,” Patel told TOI. “It was clear that he had pushed her into prostitution. We have arrested him too. A native of Saurashtra, he told us that his wife left him following which he shifted to Surat and it was just a few months ago that he forced his daughter into prostitution to earn some money,” Patel added. The police said that Chandrika Shah, who ran the racket, used to give Rs 500 commission to the girl. “In the last two days, she was sent to 10 customers,” Patel said. Apart from Shah, the cops have also arrested Mangalsinh Valmiki, Charanjit Kamboz and Jayesh Makwana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/man-arrested-for-forcing-minor-daughter-into-prostitution/articleshow/87212724.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was arrested on October 10. The court also remanded his co-accused, Ankit, Lateef, and Shekhar Bharti, to police custody for a period of 2 days. This is the second time that the special investigation team (SIT) has requested the court to grant police custody. So far, 10 people have been arrested in connection with the violence in which four farmers, one journalist, and three BJP workers lost their lives, while nearly a dozen were hurt. Special Prosecution Officer S P Yadav told TOI: “We had sought 3 days’ police custody as the investigating team wants to confront Ashish and others in the presence of Sumit Jaiswal, Shishupal (who was driving the third SUV, a white Scorpio), Nandan Singh Bisht, and Satya Prakash Tripathi alias Satyam. The four were arrested on Monday and the court had granted their custody to the police till October 24. After a long argument, the CJM granted us custody again for a period of two days. A second police custody remand is rarely granted by any court, and I have applied for the same for the first time in my career of 20 years.” He added that statements of 12 eyewitnesses have been recorded in the court under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with the FIR against Ashish Mishra and others. The people who sustained injuries are among the witnesses who were there at the spot when the vehicles mowed down the protesting farmers, he said. Earlier on Friday, deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Upendra Agarwal was transferred as the DIG of Devipatan Range in Gonda. There was speculation that he had been transferred from the investigation. However, he clarified that he would take the new charge and will continue to investigate this case, till directed otherwise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/lakhimpur-kheri-union-ministers-son-remanded-in-police-custody-again/articleshow/87213205.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Dehradun||Akhara Parishad election to be held as scheduled on October 25, says seer in race for parishad president post||HARIDWAR: A day after seven akharas of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) announced their own office-bearers’ list, Mahant Ravindra Puri, secretary of the Niranjani akhara, who has been touted as a strong contender for the post of parishad president, and whose candidature the seven akharas were opposing, said that elections to the parishad will be held as scheduled at Prayagraj on October 25. “Notice regarding the elections was sent to all akharas the day after Swami Narendra Giri's ‘shodashi bhandara’ (after-death ritual ceremony) on October 5 and there is no change in the schedule,” Puri told TOI. He termed as ‘illegal’ any announcement on office-bearers before the elections and alleged that "the majority of akharas are with the existing ABAP office bearers.” “It is strange that the breakaway group chose to name seers for posts that have not even fallen vacant. The only post vacant is that of president as Swami Narendra Giri died mid-tenure. So the question of election to other posts does not arise,” Puri said. Meanwhile, Mahant Rajendra Das has said that the elections were held democratically. “It is for the first time that 26 bonafide representatives of the 13 akharas have elected the office-bearers. The days of divide-and-rule are over,” he added. When asked as to why the seven akharas elected seers on ABAP posts that are not vacant, Ram Kishore Das, senior of the Digamber akhara, which is part of the breakaway group, said, “The earlier elections were held flouting democratic norms. We just accepted the officer-bearers because of Narendra Giri. Now that he is no more, none of the previously elected office-bearers are acceptable to us.” Besides, a fresh war of words has started between the two groups over who’s the Nirmal akhara president. The first group that supports existing ABAP officials says Resham Singh is the president of the Nirmal akhara and that he supports them. However, the other group claims that Gyan Dev Singh is the president of the Nirmal akhara and that he supports the breakaway faction. On Thursday, seven of the 13 akharas that are part of the apex body of seers, elected the president, general secretary and other office-bearers on their own. While Mahat Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani akhara was elected as the ABAP president by the breakaway faction, Mahant Rajendra Das of Nirmohi akhara was made the ABAP general secretary even as Mahant Hari Giri, the incumbent general secretary, has two more years left in his tenure. The surprise move effectively split the 13-member akhara parishad into two groups. The first group comprises seven akharas — Nirmohi, Nirvani, Digamber, Mahanirvani, Atal, Bada Udasin and Nirmal. The other group has six akharas — Niranjani, Juna, Avahan, Anand, Agni and Naya Udasin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/akhara-parishad-election-to-be-held-as-scheduled-on-october-25-says-seer-in-race-for-parishad-prez-post/articleshow/87213199.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

By the time the fire was doused, several quintals had been reduced to ashes. A video of the incident has gone viral and attracted a tweet from Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. Pramod Singh had brought his paddy for weighing at the centre at his allotted time on October 15, but the centre in-charge allegedly refused to buy the crop, citing higher moisture level in the grain than prescribed. He asked the farmer to wait for two days.  Heavy rainfall on October 17 completely drenched his crop kept in the open, forcing Singh to wait for some more days to get the paddy grains dry. On Friday, when he returned with the paddy at “the moisture level under the prescribed limit”, the centre in-charge again refused to weigh it and asked him to wait for another day. This was the last straw for Singh. He rushed and bought a can of petrol, poured it over the paddy and set it afire even as other farmers tried to stop him. The fire was doused but the damage was done. Sub-divisional magistrate Pankaj Srivastava rushed to the spot to calm frayed tempers. Speaking with TOI, a farmer at the centre alleged, “The in-charge at procurement centres do not buy our crop till we approach them through an influential politician or official. They have a nexus with middlemen who offer lesser amount for our yield and sell it at the government centres. No government has managed to change this process.” This year, the middlemen are offering Rs 1,100 for a quintal of paddy as against the government rate at Rs 1940. On his part, SDM Srivastava claimed, “I had a word with the farmer on Wednesday and advised him to sell half of the paddy which was dry and the remaining crop after it gets dry. But he said he wants to sell all of it at one go on Friday. The centre in-charge was in the process of weighing his crop when suddenly his son arrived and set the paddy on fire just to create unnecessary pressure on the administration.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/turned-away-kheri-farmer-sets-paddy-afire-at-procurement-centre/articleshow/87213224.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A communique from Parmarth Niketan said that the award “recognises individuals, families and groups who have achieved a certain standard over the course of a lifetime.” Sadhvi Bhagwati came to India almost 25 years ago, after graduating from Stanford University and while doing her PhD. She has since then been engaged in social endeavours for children, women, survivors of natural disasters, Ganga and other water bodies in Uttarakhand and elsewhere, the communique added. A disciple of Swami Chidanand Saraswati, president of Parmarth Niketan, the sadhvi is also the secretary-general of Global Interfaith WASH Alliance, described as “the world’s first initiative that brings together leaders from different faiths to work towards a goal in which every human being has access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation and proper hygiene.” She is also president of Divine Shakti Foundation, which works for women as well as orphaned and abandoned children. The sadhvi is quite popular among yoga aspirants and organises the week-long International Yoga Festival at Parmarth Niketan that draws yoga practitioners from across the world. Speaking about the recognition, the sadhvi said, “When we recognise the truth of who we are, and that we are all connected to each other as one beautiful and divine family, it is the most natural thing in the world to want to serve each member of that family. I thank President Biden and AmeriCorps for so ardently supporting that -- by God’s grace -- comes so naturally.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/us-prez-presents-lifetime-achievement-award-to-rishikesh-based-stanford-educated-seer/articleshow/87213215.cms||MS Nawaz

---||India||HC: Just accepting cash illegally not enough to draw graft charge||CUTTACK:The Orissa HC has ruled that mere acceptance of any amount by way of illegal gratification or its recovery is outside the scope of the proof of demand and is not sufficient to bring home the charge under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The single-judge bench of Justice S K Sahoo said, “The proof of demand of illegal gratification is the essence of accusation of the offences under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and in the absence thereof, the charge would fail.” The complainant cannot be placed on any better footing than that of an accomplice and corroboration in material particulars connecting the accused with the crime has to be insisted upon, Justice Sahoo ruled. The ruling by the vacation bench came on Thursday while allowing the criminal appeal of Sanatan Dash, who was convicted for taking a bribe of Rs 500 and sentenced to two years of rigorous im- prisonment by the special judge vigilance in Bhubaneswar nearly 18 years ago. “The prosecution evidence with regard to the de- mand and acceptance of a bribe amount of Rs 500 by the appellant from the complainant for passing his house rent bill appears to be shaky in nature. When there is absence of sufficient, cogent and reliable evidence on record to establish the guilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt and the impugned judgment suffers from perversity, the same cannot be sustained in the eye of law and accordingly, I am constrained to give benefit of doubt to the appellant,” Justice Sahoo said in his 37-page judgment. The impugned judgment and order of conviction of the appellant and the sentence passed on December 3, 2003 are hereby set aside and the appellant is acquitted of all the charges, Justice Sahoo’s order read.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-just-accepting-cash-illegally-not-enough-to-draw-graft-charge/articleshow/87215579.cms||---

---||Kochi||Row in council over corp’s main office project estimate||Kochi: Lack of clarity regarding the revised estimate for the construction of the main office of the city corporation resulted in unruly scenes during the corporation council meeting held on Friday. While the UDF-led opposition demanded that all the agendas related to the work of the main office be postponed, the ruling LDF and the mayor took a stubborn stand that the agendas should be passed. This led to voting and the LDF won with 36 votes against 28. Even the BJP councillors voted in favour of passing the agenda. Though the original estimate for constructing the new office building at Marine Drive in 2005 was Rs 12 crore, the cost escalated over the years. According to mayor M Anil Kumar, the revised cost of construction will be nearly Rs 64 crore. When the agendas seeking the council’s nod for various works related to the construction of the main office came for consideration, the opposition demanded details of the estimate. The corporation has already completed work to the tune of around Rs 18 crore. “The government had given administrative sanction for only Rs 24.71 crore works. But, the mayor says that we will need Rs 40 crore more and then the total cost will rise to Rs 64 crore. We want to know the details of the estimate and how much money is required for each work,” opposition leader Antony Kureethra said. He said the corporation authorities split the works into various components worth less than Rs 2 crore. If the work requires a bigger amount, the permission from the government is mandatory. The corporation authorities split the work for getting exemption from seeking the government nod, Kureethra alleged. The corporation authorities were planning to construct the main office with centralized air-conditioning (AC). But the opposition has challenged the move to opt for a centralized AC system for a structure on the shores of the backwaters. However, the corporation authorities informed that they are backing out from the proposal for a centralized AC system considering the objection from the opposition councillors. Meanwhile, the mayor has made it clear that the work on the main office building will be completed as per target. He said that he would welcome any investigations into the work of the main office, including a vigilance probe. He also said that instructions have been given to Blue Box, the contracting firm, that cost escalation should not be there. It is for expediting the project that the works were split into various components, Kumar said. The corporation authorities aim to complete the construction by August 2022. According to them, around 90% of the civil works have been completed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/row-in-council-over-corps-main-office-project-estimate/articleshow/87213237.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh has potential to feed India: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: By the time the government completes five years in power, 25 lakh hectare additional land in UP will have access to irrigation facilities, said chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday. He was speaking at a ceremony to distribute appointment letters to 1,863 technical assistants in the agriculture department of which six were handed over the letter by the CM. The CM said it was only after his government came to power that agricultural facilities started improving. He said if the state used better techniques, cooperated with farmers and used existing infrastructure in a better way, UP alone can feed the entire country. “Before we came to power, the Centre wanted to give 20 Krishi Vigyan Kendra to the state but the then government did not want farmers to progress. There was no procurement policy in the state before 2017 and immediately after we took oath, I sent teams to various states to study their procurement models and by April 1, 3,000 wheat procurement centres were set up,” he said. He further elaborated on various irrigation schemes like the Ban Sagar scheme which had been pending for 40 years, the Saryu scheme which was approved in 1971 but is yet to be completed. “We are going to complete this in November this year. The Ban Sagar scheme was completed in 2018,” he said. The CM said that before 2017, UP had the best facilities but people had a very negative impression about it. “We put in systems and the result is that UP now has the second largest economy in the country. It was said that UP had no potential for jobs, no government schemes could be implemented as bureaucracy was coming in the way. In ease of doing business we were 14th or 15th. Now, we are in second place. UP is first in the implementation of 44 government schemes. In 4.5 years, we have given 4.5 lakh government jobs,” he said. The CM said the transparency and fairness followed in the process of appointment should be implemented by the newly appointed employees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-has-potential-to-feed-india-yogi/articleshow/87214711.cms||---

The UDD circular helped the BMC to avoid holding physical meetings. The circular was even submitted in court. At the last online meeting the opposition parties had slammed the Shiv Sena the ruling party in tye BMC accusing it of thwarting discussions on important proposals. Opposition leaders said the online meetings allowed the Sena to clear proposals without discussion. “It is because of the consistent follow ups by the BJP and the fear of contempt of court that the state has now allowed physical meetings,” said BJP party spokesperson Bhalchandra Shirsat. All municipal corporations, councils, nagar parishads and panchayats have been allowed to hold physical meetings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-can-now-hold-in-person-meetings-again/articleshow/87214039.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Mayawati keeps up attack on Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, tells her to look beyond Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati’s constant attacks on Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, as the grand old party ramps up its campaign for the UP elections, appear to go beyond UP politics.  Mayawati’s references to Congress governments in Rajasthan and Punjab are a clear indication of her attempt to hit the party in both UP and Punjab as a weak Congress is unlikely to impact her in UP but is in power in Punjab where BSP is contesting upcoming assembly polls in alliance with the Akali Dal. Over the past few days, Mayawati has made it a point to react to most election promises made by Gandhi, questioning the party on its performance in Rajasthan and Punjab. Recently, when Congress announced that it would reserve 40% of all seats in the UP polls for women, Mayawati had called it “drama” aimed at getting political gains in the state. On Friday, a day after Priyanka Gandhi announced smartphones and two-wheelers for girl students who excelled in studied, Mayawati once again raised the party's performance in Rajasthan and Punjab to to allege that nobody was going to take Congress’ promises seriously. “Congress has started making populist election promises like SP and BJP under which its latest offer is to provide smartphones and two-wheelers to girls if it gets elected in UP. However, the important question is, who will take them seriously. There are Congress governments in Rajasthan and Punjab but what have they done for people that they should be believed. If they have not done anything, why should people trust them? This is why there is such a massive trust deficit in the promises made by parties like Congress and BJP,” she said, adding that it was because it cheated people that Congress was witnessing such bad days. A senior BSP member explained that Punjab, where Congress is in power but staring at an uncertain future after the massive power struggle that it just witnessed, leading to the resignation of then CM Amrinder Singh who has announced that he will set up a new political outfit, power in the upcoming election was for anyone to take. “BSP is contesting these elections in alliance with former BJP partners Akali Dal. The farmers issue is ripe in the state, which also has a huge Dalit population. It is crucial for BSP to take on Congress there to be able to make inroads. By taking on Congress in UP, she is making a smart move to hit two birds with the same stone,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/maya-keeps-up-attack-on-pgv-tells-her-to-look-beyond-up/articleshow/87214724.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The government has now appointed a private agency for this task. The file is pending for financial approval by the government,” Gaude told reporters on Friday on the sidelines of a function held to hand over sanads under the FRA to 27 beneficiaries at the South Goa collectorate, Margao. Of the 10,136 claims received by the government under the FRA, currently 46 sanads have been issued to the beneficiaries. Gaude said that he hoped that the outsourcing of the spot verification exercise to the private agency would help expedite matters. The agency has been asked to complete the task within a year. Gaude also urged people and stakeholders to ensure that gram sabhas fulfill the requirement of a quorum for approving the rest of the FRA claims. Of the total of 10,136 claims, spot verification has been completed for 4,043 claims, while 1,614 claims have been approved by gram sabhas and 549 claims have been approved by the sub-divisional level committee, whereas 387 claims are settled by district-level committees. 12 of the claims for land rights have been rejected.

He urged the Haryana khap panchayats to intervene and amicably resolve them by involving representatives of the concerned communities. Charuni said, “Today we are passing through a very crucial period when the country’s BJP government is working to sell the entire nation. There is bad news, that we are getting divided on lines of communalism and casteism... At many places in Haryana, different castes are going through estrangements. We have come to know that they (people of different castes) are running campaigns against each other and indulging in disputes in several villages of Haryana. It is my request with folded hands to everyone that if we get divided on the lines of communalism and casteism, then BJP will benefit and the entire nation will go to ruins. Today, BJP and RSS want to create such rifts, but we should beware.” “I urge all khap panchayats that wherever such issues are in the villages of Haryana, their representatives should intervene and establish the brotherhood by any means. I came to know that there are disputes in three-four villages where these should be settled,” he said. The farm leader also urged the leaders of Dalit communities to intervene in such matters and talk to persons concerned to resolve irksome issues.

The rural development department, in response to the RTI query filed by Kashipur-based activist Nadeemuddin, has also disclosed that a cumulative amount of Rs 1,256.50 crore was allotted to the 71 legislators during the aforementioned period under MLALAD funds. The fund was equally distributed and each legislator was allotted Rs 17.75 crore during the period. Out of this cumulative amount, the legislators were able to use Rs 963 crore — i.e 77% of the total amount. The remaining Rs 293 crore is yet to be spent on developmental projects. The response to the RTI query also gives data relating to the performance of legislators in regards to using the fund. It reveals that out of the 71 legislators, 12 have spent less than 70% of the MLALAD fund allotted to them. Speaking on the response to his RTI query, activist Nadeemuddin told TOI, “The MLALAD fund is meant to be used for the welfare of people. The unutilised amount is a matter of concern.” The best performing legislator from the state is Sanjiv Arya, who recently resigned from the assembly along with his father Yashpal Arya after joining the Congress. He has spent 90% of the fund allocated for his constituency. On the other side of the spectrum is Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat, who has just used 50% of the fund. When asked about the low usage of MLALAD fund, Rawat said, “The projects are being deliberately delayed by officials. Months back, I had approved the purchase of medical equipment, worth Rs 1 crore, but no action has been taken since. Similarly, other key projects are also being delayed. Other than that, I just have a small amount left which I will use to buy dialysis machines.” The MLAs who were able to use 86-90% of the fund are — Kunwar Singh Champion, Ram Singh Keda, Furkan Ahmed, Adesh Chauhan (Ranipur), Banshidhar Bhagat, Dhan Singh Negi, Navin Chandra Dumka, Gopal Singh Rawat and Sanjeev Arya.

---||Kochi||Govt will restore synagogue to its original state: Minister||Kochi: The government would soon take measures to restore Kadavumbhagam synagogue to its original state, said minister for museums and archaeology Ahmed Devarkovil after visiting the synagogue on Friday. He said government would hold discussions with experts. He inspected the temporary roofing over the structure which was built recently. The roof was constructed to protect the structure from collapse due to rains and other reasons. K J Maxi MLA, who accompanied the minister, has demanded that the government should take measures to provide electricity connection to the synagogue. A watchman should also deployed for taking care of the security of the synagogue. A worker for cleaning the synagogue and its premises is also needed, Maxi said. Devarkovil has assured the MLA that the government would consider all those issues favourably. It was in mid-September that the archaeology department had completed erection of the temporary roof. The nearly five centuries-old synagogue had been in a dilapidated condition for the past several years. In 1956, most of the Malabari Jews who owned the synagogue left for Israel. In 1972, the last Malabari Jew, who was the custodian of the synagogue, also left for Israel. According to those who study the history of the synagogue, the Jews had sold the synagogues and the land in which it is situated to some local residents. Then, the synagogue changed hands before Regina, the last owner of the building and land, possessed it. Meanwhile, the likes of A Karmachandran, a Jew historian, had demanded the government to take over the synagogue and protect it. But, Regina had mortgaged the land by the time. This had complicated the government’s effort to take over the synagogue. However, the archaeology department took over the synagogue on July 1, 2021, after clearing all the hurdles. One of the major hurdles in the way of restoring the structure was the objection from local residents. They feared that there would be restrictions on construction around 300m of the synagogue once the government takes it over. Additional chief secretary V Venu had held a meeting to allay their fears on July 7 and convinced residents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/govt-will-restore-synagogue-to-its-original-state-minister/articleshow/87213260.cms||---

As per the supreme court orders, the kin of the covid victims will get Rs 50,000 as ex-gratia amount and the same has to be processed through National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Based on these guidelines, the relief and rehabilitation department of Maharashtra has asked the district administration to appoint District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to process the applications online only. “The DDMA Nashik will be empowered to process the applications through ‘online’ mode only. The details of the process will be announced soon. Once declared, the citizens can file applications either from their homes or through Mahaonline portals,” Mandhare added. The collectorate was flooded with applications for the relief and daily, there were hundreds of enquiries about the process for getting the ex-gratia amount. Benefitting from the situation, some so-called ‘middle-men' had started making money illegally by charging Rs 200 to Rs 2,000 from the needy people on the promise of ‘processing’ the applications. “We found out about these illegal activities and a complaint has been lodged with Sarkarwada police. They are investing the matter further,” Mandhare said. Earlier this month, the cash-strapped state disaster management department had decided to seek financial assistance from the Centre to pay ex gratia to the kin of those who died of Covid-19. In the state, the total sum to be disbursed, through the SRDF comes up to Rs750 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-disaster-mgmt-body-to-process-forms-for-covid-relief/articleshow/87213271.cms||---

With the party having just appointed Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma as the new state in-charge, Rahul met a delegation of important Gujarat leaders to discuss the im- pending party rejig and the challenges ahead. It is learnt that a large part of the discussion was about the new head of the Gujarat Congress who is to be appointed. While all the state leaders generally claim that the party is united, the concerns in the leadership are about the possibility of factionalism breaking out after the nomination of the new chief. The late 2022 Gujarat elections are a top priority for the party given that the state is the home turf of PM Narendra Modi and the party came very close to dislodging the BJP from power in 2017. Given the high stakes, Rahul held a one on one meeting with Gujarat netas. While details of the interactions are not known, it is said that he sought the opinion of individual leaders about the possible candidate to head the state unit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-2022-polls-rahul-discusses-gujarat-congress-rejig/articleshow/87215588.cms||---

Waste handling facilities at Ukkadam and Peelamedu were operated throughout the intervening night of Thursday and Friday to shift the collected waste to the Vellalore waste disposal yard.“We received instructions from the commissioner’s office to clear waste by Friday evening. Although we could not clear it completely, streets are much cleaner now,” said a health official of the south zone.Usually, festivals like Ayudha Puja and Pongal leave a huge quantity of waste on streets. The recent Ayudha Puja festival generated an estimated three times of the 850 tonnes of waste generated on ordinary days.“The only way to bring down the time involved in waste collection after such festivals is by enhancing door-to-door waste collection. But residents are not cooperating. We had suggested night rounds to prevent dumping of waste on streets and levying fines on people, but did not proceed with it as it would require more manpower,” said a health official of the north zone.M Devendran, a resident of Urumandampalayam, said that most of the stretches in ward 43 have been cleaned. “The civic body should implement door-to-door waste collection strictly and punish those who dump waste on roads,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/mass-cleaning-drive-launched-to-remove-puja-festival-litter/articleshow/87214043.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Vaccination twist: 120% coverage, yet many left out in Bhopal||BHOPAL: While the district administration claims to have vaccinated 120% of the targeted population in Bhopal, there are some people here & there who have not got even a single dose of the vaccine. Virender Singh, 56, is one such a person. Ask him why he didn’t get vaccinated and he has no reasonable answer. “I thought, I have enough immunity power to fight the coronavirus. To me, the vaccine appeared to be more of a placebo. A psychological treatment. My wife and both sons have got vaccinated. I can also take it, but I don’t think it makes much of a difference,” said Virender, who had fallen ill with symptoms quite similar to corona virus in the first wave itself but didn’t get himself tested for Covid-19 and recovered from medicines prescribed by a doctor. When told that his reasoning for not taking the jabs doesn’t seem convincing, he said “I believe the more you fear a disease or anything, the more prone you become to it,” while putting the phone down. Virender is among a few people in the city who have stayed away from vaccination but there are many, who got the first dose very late for reasons of their own and are yet to get the second dose. Activist duo, Rachna Dhingra and Satinath Sarangi, got the first dose only last month and would be getting the second dose after almost two months. Both had contracted Covid in the first wave and remained admitted in the hospital. Rachna, later, also set up a helpline for Covid patients at Hamidia Hospital. When asked why she got the first jab so late, Rachna said “ I had to be convinced about the efficacy of the vaccine. I was witness to how trials of Covaxin were conducted. They didn’t had data of the third phase of trial when the vaccine was given approval. Data from Pfizer and other RNA vaccines was available and when Covishield came up with data, we decided to get the jab of Covishield”, she said. If Rachna delayed vaccination because she wanted to be sure about the efficacy of the vaccine, Kishore Mali, 25, a resident of Khajuri Kalan on the outskirts of the city, had not got vaccinated for quite some time because there was rumour in their village that people are dying after taking the vaccine jab. Nobody in his family and the village at large was ready to take the vaccine. In the meanwhile, 2-3 people in the village died of the disease. Kishore also fell ill with symptoms akin to that of coronavirus infection but he didn’t get himself tested. He treated himself with the medicines that he had seen in the viral prescriptions, which were quite in vogue in those days, and recovered. Mali, a driver, was already being persuaded by the owner of his company to get vaccinated. After recovering from the disease, he went for vaccination but was told that he could only get the vaccine after three months. He took the vaccine somewhere in August and now waits for his turn to get the second jab. In fact, till the second devastating wave of coronavirus hit the city in March, not many were taking the vaccine. Vaccination centres were empty and after the second wave, which saw a lot of people perishing to the deadly virus and many more falling ill, crowds surged at the vaccination centres for taking the jab. Those who had recovered from Covid were told to come after three months and that’s how their first dose got delayed. Many people, particularly the elderly decided to wait for some more time fearing that they might contract the infection at crowded vaccination centres but shortage of vaccines persisted for some months and so did the crowd at vaccination centres. But, there are people who were not taking vaccines not because of any specific reason (fear, rumours or distrust) but because the head of the family decided that nobody in the family would take vaccines. “My elder brother decided that we won’t take the vaccine. So, we didn’t take the jab for quite some time. Once my younger brother and I went to a vaccination centre to meet our friend, who worked there. He insisted that we should take the first jab. We tried to resist saying we don’t have our Adhar card and things like that. He said that can be taken care of. We shall get your Adhar no. later on. Ultimately, we took the vaccine and also put the pictures on Facebook and next day, everyone in the family had the jab”, said Asraf, who works with a private firm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/vax-twist-120-coverage-yet-many-left-out-in-bhopal/articleshow/87213278.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

P Arun Kumar, son of labourer N Ponnalagan, will soon enter the hallowed precincts of Indian Institute of Technology in a rare instance of a state government student gaining admission to the premier institute. Hailing from Karadipatty village, located 50km from Trichy city, Arun Kumar’s fortunes began to change when he was selected by the school education department and Trichy district administration for an entrance test in 2019 for JEE coaching. The programme was offered by IGNITTE, a facility run by students of NIT-Trichy to help economically backward students crack competitive exams. Residing in a tile-roofed house with his parents, two sisters and grandparents, Arun Kumar cleared the test amid distractions and financial difficulties. Arun initially attended coaching classes using his basic mobile phone through calls that lasted 30 minutes a day amid network issues. Later, his father N Ponnalagan shelled out Rs 10,000 to buy his son a smartphone to attend online classes. The cost-free laptop given by the government had audio issues, he said. Doing odd jobs like helper in restaurants in Kanchipuram, Arun’s father was particular that his son got proper school education. “Six years ago, as I could not afford the fee of a private school, I enrolled him in a government school. I never thought about pushing him to work as he is a bright student,” Ponnalagan told TOI. IGNITTE coordinator S Rohit said Arun will get a seat in one of the IITs going by the past year’s seat allotments. Arun’s school headmistress Amutha Bharathi claimed no other government school student in the state has cleared JEE advanced yet. Arun is frank enough to admit that he was not aware of the existence of IITs until 2019. “Quality coaching and practice and more importantly the faith reposed in me by my family and school helped me achieve this feat. I did not let myself get distracted by our difficulties and financial constraints,” he told TOI. The headmistress said that even after the pandemic as coaching went virtual, Arun dedicated himself to self-learning. Even now, the boy’s family is worried about paying the semester fee costing over a lakh in an IIT as their monthly income hardly adds up to Rs 10,000. With counselling for IIT admission likely to commence in the next few days, Arun’s family is counting on scholarships and good Samaritans to fulfil the dream of a government school student to enter IIT. His family can be reached at 96984-46253.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-labourers-son-beats-odds-to-ace-jee-in-1st-attempt-enters-iit/articleshow/87214062.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath compares SP rule with medieval period dynasties||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath once again mounted a blistering attack on the Samajwadi Party on Friday, comparing its previous government in UP with the rule of "medieval period dynasties" which targeted temples and trampled sentiments of the Hindu community. “Pichli sarkar ka karyakaal madhyakaleen kalkhand ki yaad dilata hai jab mandir tode jaate they aur Hinduon ki bhawnaon ko kuchala jata tha..un par kutharaghat kiya jata tha,” Yogi thundered, while speaking at BJP's Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan in Lucknow. Yogi's fresh attack on SP came a day after he censured the previous Mulayam Singh Yadav government for ordering firing on “Ram Bhakts” on November 2, 1990. “After coming back to power in 2012, the first decision which the SP government took was withdrawal of cases against those who were accused of perpetrating terror in Ramjanmabhoomi,” Yogi charged, even as he blamed the previous Akhilesh Yadav government of getting people of Hindu community implicated under false charges. “Atankwadiyon ki toh aarti utari jaati thi…,” he went on, adding that the police stations and tehsils were mortgaged to party workers who indulged in `loot' of resources. Yogi said that the coming of Ram Temple in Ayodhya signified “rectifying a fault”. It also meant that people with self-respect were “unwilling” to accept slavery, he said. At the same time, he unleashed a scathing tirade on Congress, accusing it of doing politics “at the cost of the country" while indulging in corruption and putting the security of the country at stake. “Today, Pakistan or China cannot invade India’s territory. And if they do, then the country knows to repulse it,” he said. The CM maintained that it was Congress which sowed the seeds of terrorism in 1952 by framing Article 370 that gave special rights to Jammu and Kashmir. “The BJP has done away with the article…na rahega baans…na bajegi bansuri…” he remarked, while addressing the convention focussing on Chauhans among OBCs Terming representatives of the community as ‘praharis’ of society, Yogi exhorted them to reach out at the grassroots and tell people as to why a BJP government was important in 2022. “No one can dare orchestrate communal violence in the state in the BJP government. No criminal or mafia can encroach public or private property,” he maintained. He said that the 2007 communal violence in Azamgarh erupted just because a call was given to sing `Vande Mataram’, the national song. “Whoever tries to ban Vande mataram should be dislodged,” Yogi said. He asserted that his government had fulfilled all basic needs of various communities. “It was now time for representatives of these communities to tell people how the BJP government worked for its welfare,” he said. The CM also charged the opposition parties of having no interest in welfare of the poor and the backward classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/yogi-compares-sp-rule-with-medieval-period-dynasties/articleshow/87214753.cms||Pankaj Shah

Sena MP Sanjay Raut questioned, “Have we really administered 100 crore doses? If we have really done so then it is a matter of pride. But different figures are being given on vaccination. Some say only 33 crore people are fully vaccinated, and some say that many have not received their second dose. But an event is taking place in the country. It has become a new tradition to celebrate such things.” He added, “If the Centre has decided to celebrate this kind of event, then let them, we will participate in it. It is our country after all.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-have-we-really-hit-100cr-doses/articleshow/87214073.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: New plan for seamless traffic on Tonk Road||JAIPUR: City police Friday unveiled a new plan to facilitate seamless vehicular movement on the Tonk Road. As per the new plan, a specific spot will be earmarked for buses near the foot overbridge (FoB) at Narayan Singh Circle so that passengers could easily use the FoB without impeding the traffic. Additional commissioner of police, law and order, Haider Ali Zaidi and DCP (Traffic), Shweta Dhankar, held a meeting on Friday and directed police officials that the bus stand at the Rambagh intersection should be shifted about 100 meters away towards the university road. Similarly, a cut between the Tonk road flyover and Gopalpura flyover across the Glass Factory was closed down permanently on Friday morning. Sources informed TOI that accidents due to u-turns had become a major spot of concern there. Zaidi said that encroachments outside the SMS hospital, and from Suchna Kendra to Prithviraj T-point will be removed very soon. He said that kiosks and dairy booths on these locations will be shifted to another place. The traffic police also said that one of the two bus shelters across the MGD school will also be removed to resolve the bottlenecks on Yadgar road. Zaidi said that the city police had conducted a comprehensive study of problems that plagued the Tonk Road. “Tonk Road is a major arterial road. It is important that the road should operate with seamless traffic round the clock. There were some pressure points and bottlenecks which needed to be resolved,” he said. Zaidi said that a similar plan has been made for other roads of the city. “We are examining problems that people face on other equally important roads of the city. Similar arrangements will be made on other roads too,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/new-plan-for-seamless-traffic-on-tonk-road/articleshow/87214074.cms||---

Ved Sah, secretary of Nainital Hotels’ Association, told TOI that 90% of the bookings for the next two months have been cancelled. “Tourists are scared to come after the casualties that have been reported in rain-related incidents,” Sah said. At 35 deaths, Nainital — which saw record-breaking rainfall this week— has reported the highest number of casualties among all 13 districts. Hoteliers, however, said the situation is now stable and the skies have cleared up. Dinesh Sah, president of the association, said road blockages have made destinations inaccessible. “Almost all hotels have reported cancellations for the weekend. If the administration speeds up work on clearing the roads then tourism might get back on track soon,” he said. Notably, Nainital had remained cut off from the state for two days after all three routes to it were blocked by landslides. After road connectivity was restored on Wednesday, tourists had left the town in hordes. Hoteliers also rued the fact that their Covid-hit businesses had just started to bounce back as vaccinated people took to travel. Sameer Sah, a hotelier from Nainital, said the town was safe to travel and no deaths had been reported within the town. “People are scared to come because of visuals that were shared online. The government needs to take measures to restore confidence in tourism,” he said. Abhay Arora, a resident of Delhi who had planned a family trip to Nainital this weekend, said he cancelled after he saw videos of flooded Mall Road. “I had planned a trip with my wife, child and parents but decided to cancel as it didn’t seem to be safe any more,” he said. In Mussoorie as well, hoteliers reported a large number of cancellations and a drastic dip in hotel occupancy. “There have been many cancellations over the past few days. Hotel occupancy has dipped to 30% this weekend, which is nearly half of the occupancy we had recorded earlier this month,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, secretary of Mussoorie Hotels’ Association.

---||Lucknow||A chance encounter is the genesis of a viral image||Lucknow: One of the most-used adages about the city, ‘Muskuraiye Ki Aap Lucknow Mein Hain’ (Smile, you are in Lucknow) came true for Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra when the two met onboard a flight to Lucknow on Friday evening. It was a chance encounter and a photograph of the two leaders smiling and exchanging pleasantries while getting down at Amausi airport went viral. Akhilesh was on his way back to Lucknow after a day’s visit to New Delhi where he called on SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and is learnt to have held a meeting with party’s principal general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav related to UP Elections. Priyanka had reached Lucknow and was scheduled to visit Barabanki on Saturday to flag off Congress Pratigya Yatras which will criss-cross the state to inform the people about the party's seven “pledges”. It’s not known who clicked the picture, but it's confirmed that the two leaders were on the same afternoon flight to Lucknow Friday. It is a known fact that it was the initiative of Akhilesh and Priyanka that had led to an alliance between SP and Congress before 2017 assembly elections. It is said that when negotiations over seat-sharing between the two parties had hit a roadblock, it was a phone call from Priyanka to Akhilesh that helped salvage the situation. That the experiment failed to meet the expectations of the two parties as Congress won seven seats and SP’s tally stood at 49, is another matter. After another failed experiment in 2019, when SP had a tie-up with BSP, Akhilesh announced that he would not enter into an alliance with any of the big political banners. The Congress, too, has shown no inclination to tie-up with the SP and has been attacking BSP as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/a-chance-encounter-is-the-genesis-of-a-viral-image/articleshow/87214762.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Energy minister B D Kalla on Friday said that the coal mine spread over 841.53 hectare was allotted to the state in 2015 but the mining activities could not be taken up in the absence of environment clearance. “We created pressure by submitting the bio-diversity study report and as a result the mine got the clearance,” Kalla said. The Parsa coal block lies contiguous to Parsa East and Kete Basin (PEKB) from where the state is already getting coal to fire up its plants. But the environment ministry is yet to give clearance to start the phase-II of the PEKB mines. “We have put pressure on the centre to give cenvironment clearance to the phase-II area of PEKB which is spread over 1,136 hectares. We expect to get the clearance very soon. After that there will be no shortage of coal at the power plants,” added Kalla. It is estimated that the Parsa coal block can supply 2.7 rake coal daily and the field has the capacity to produce 5 million tonne coal annually. “The state is estimated to get 1000 rakes annually from the Parsa coal block. The mine has reserves of 150 million tonne coal and can produce till 30 years,” said energy additional chief secretary Subodh Agarwal. Coal shortage has been a national issue but Rajasthan has suffered more than any other state because it had defaulted on payments to the coal suppliers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/rajs-coal-mine-in-cgarh-gets-green-nod-to-get-2-7-rakes-daily/articleshow/87214069.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Multiplexes with discount on tickets, freebies pull in crowds, thin audience at other screens||Mumbai: Multiplexes and theatres reopened on Friday after nearly a year to relatively sparse crowds, except for those movie halls that had offers and freebies for audiences. One of the reasons was Covid guidelines issued by the government. Besides temperature checks and green ticks on the Aarogya Setu app, some patrons had to furnish vaccine certificates and adapt to the new normal, given that theatres were allowed to operate at 50% capacity. At a Borivli multiplex, a very disappointed teenager walked away from the box office with his mother on being denied entry as he was underage, despite the government not mandating any such requirement. To draw in audiences, some multiplexes had free morning shows, a few threw in a free tub of popcorn per ticket purchased and others had heavily discounted ticket prices. “We were almost sold out for morning shows across all our multiplexes in Maharashtra. The overall turnout during the day has been reminiscent to the pre-Covid days and we are certain that the sentiment would remain like this,” said Rajeev Patni, COO, Inox Leisure. Siddhesh, a Thane-based engineering graduate, turned up at least 15 minutes early to catch the 9.55am show of the latest James Bond movie. “I’m here for the experience,” said Siddhesh while waiting for three of his friends. While Pooja Parikh, who caught a morning show of the new Marvel movie at Nariman Point, said it’s important to follow safety protocols, she accepted the inability to ask friends in the adjacent seat about complex movie scenes and the prospect of eating her movie staple—cheese popcorn— in the foyer as minor trade-offs for the communal viewing experience. Four 20-something students converged at a Borivli movie hall after “much research” as only selected movie halls were screening the Marvel movie and the group “had not missed a single one till date”. These two movies are the only releases that are drawing audiences for now, according to box office staff. Some multiplexes like Carnival Cinemas have opened fewer properties at present because of limited content available. “We are confident that footfall will increase on November 5 when we have two big-ticket releases. We plan to throw open all our properties then,” said Prashant Kulkarni, senior vice-president, sales marketing, Carnival Cinemas.  Multiplex managements said that audiences appeared more comfortable with stepping out now as compared to last year. “When we had reopened cinemas for a short spell in October-November 2020, some guests were apprehensive about using washrooms. Now, masking up and sanitizing have become a way of life. Besides, our staff are 100% vaccinated and that inspires confidence," said a multiplex owner. Single screens did not share the same experience as multiplexes. At Thane’s Vandana talkies, the larger-than-life crow sculpture that welcomes visitors, seemed desolate. The theatre was among the single-screens in the city that remained shut. Nitin Datar of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India stated that some single-screens are waiting for the big releases to reopen their gates and fortunes. Among those that reopened were Maratha Mandir, whose manager noted a drop in footfalls for their longest-running 11am show. “Vaccine,” answered the monosyllabic manager when asked for the reason for this dip. Despite the lukewarm first-day-first-show turnout and the dwindling single-screens though, film critic Dilip Thakur remained optimistic. “The craze for films and cricket will never die.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-multiplexes-with-discount-on-tickets-freebies-pull-in-crowds-thin-audience-at-other-screens/articleshow/87214081.cms||Nitasha Natu

Civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade held meetings with the priests and prominent people from the religious communities and appealed to the priests to spread the message that vaccines are safe through interactions with the people. Earlier, district collector Rahul Rekhawar had asked the religious leaders to make an appeal regarding the same via social media. “We have decided to arrange special vaccination camps at schools located near the religious places. Religious leaders have been asked to encourage people to get vaccinations. Many religious leaders have themselves taken the lead to remove vaccine hesitancy by taking jabs. The people arriving at the religious places for weekly or monthly prayers will be vaccinated in such special camps,” said Balkawade. The religious leaders have claimed that the vaccine hesitancy is due to the misinformation being spread through social media. It has been found that women from minority communities are not turning up for vaccinations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/special-vax-camps-at-schools-near-religious-places-balkawade/articleshow/87213305.cms||---

She allegedly gave them forged appointment letters bearing forged signatures of institute director, academic dean, former deputy director and recruitment cell in-charge. The fraud came to the fore when the victims reached the institute to join their respective jobs. Acting on a woman’s complaint, Bag Sewania police registered a case on charges of fraud against the accused on Thursday. Police were investigating the role of other employees of the institute in the matter. Investigation officer SI Vinay Singh said that complainant Geeta Chouhan, 39, a resident of Bagmugaliya Extension, in her complaint to police stated that a few months back she came in contact with one Vijayalaxmi Vanshkar, who hails from Tikamgarh and worked as an outsourced nursing staff at AIIMS. She was removed from the job in December last year over complaints. Vijayalaxmi told Geeta that she had influential contacts in AIIMS and can help some people in getting a job at the institute. SI Singh said that Geeta was in need of a job so she agreed to pay Rs 1.21 lakh to Vijayalaxmi for getting the job. She was handed a forged appointment letter. Similarly, five others including Varsha, Sohit, Durga Uikey, Rohit Kumar and Vineet Pandey were allegedly duped by the accused in similar manner and given forged appointment letters. She charged them Rs 1.15 lakh each for the job opportunities and gave them appointment letters for the post of attenders and technicians. When they went to the institute to join their respective posts, the AIIMS management informed them that the appointment letters were forged. Subsequently, the matter was reported to police. SI Singh said that police have registered a case against Vijayalaxmi on Geeta’s complaint. Police were investigating whether other officials of the institute were involved in the fraud. Further investigations were on in the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/aiims-job-trap-6-duped-of-over-rs-5l-woman-booked/articleshow/87213303.cms||---

P Arun Kumar, son of labourer N Ponnalagan, will soon enter the hallowed precincts of Indian Institute of Technology in a rare instance of a state government student gaining admission to the premier institute. Hailing from Karadipatty village, located 50km from Trichy city, Arun Kumar’s fortunes began to change when he was selected by the school education department and Trichy district administration for an entrance test in 2019 for JEE coaching. The programme was offered by IGNITTE, a facility run by students of NIT-Trichy to help economically backward students crack competitive exams. Residing in a tile-roofed house with his parents, two sisters and grandparents, Arun Kumar cleared the test amid distractions and financial difficulties. Arun initially attended coaching classes using his basic mobile phone through calls that lasted 30 minutes a day amid network issues. Later, his father N Ponnalagan shelled out Rs Rs 10,000 to buy his son a smartphone to attend online classes. The cost-free laptop given by the government had audio issues, he said. Doing odd jobs like helper in restaurants in Kancheepuram, Arun’s father was particular that his son got proper school education. “Six years ago, as I could not afford the fee of a private school, I enrolled him in a government school. I never thought about pushing him to work as he is a bright student,” Ponnalagan told TOI. IGNITTE coordinator S Rohit said Arun will get a seat in one of the IITs going by the past year’s seat allotments. Arun’s school headmistress Amutha Bharathi claimed no other government school student in the state has cleared JEE advanced yet. Arun is frank enough to admit that he was not aware of the existence of IITs until 2019. “Quality coaching and practice and more importantly the faith reposed in me by my family and school helped me achieve this feat. I did not let myself get distracted by our difficulties and financial constraints,” he told TOI. The headmistress said that even after the pandemic as coaching went virtual, Arun dedicated himself to self-learning. Even now, the boy’s family is worried about paying the semester fee costing over a lakh in an IIT as their monthly income hardly adds up to Rs Rs 10,000. With counselling for IIT admission likely to commence in the next few days, Arun’s family is counting on scholarships and Good Samaritans to fulfil the dream of a government school student to enter IIT. His family can be reached at 96984-46253||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/tn-labourers-son-beats-odds-to-ace-jee-in-1st-attempt-enters-iit/articleshow/87214083.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Bhopal||Fables forever: Riveting Panchatantra stories narrated at puppet festival in Bhopal||BHOPAL: There are some stories which are an integral part of one’s childhood and never lose their charm or intrinsic appeal. Panchatantra tales certainly belong to this category and the subtle message given through these stories touches the heart, whatever your age. On Friday, people of Bhopal got a chance to revisit their childhood at the ongoing Putul Samaroh (puppet festival) at the Tribal Museum. The five-day festival that began on October 20, will conclude on Sunday. Each day, there are families coming along with children to enjoy some colourful sagas narrated here via some beautiful puppets. Interestingly, along with children, it is the elders who enjoy these puppet shows to the hilt. There were two stories narrated by puppets on Friday, which got a thumbs up from Bhopalis. Presented by Delhi’s Akshay Bhat and his group, popular tales -- ‘Sone ki choodi’ and ‘Pinjre mein sher’ -- were delightfully presented by puppets dressed to perfection, with appropriate backdrop and props etc. The first story ‘Sone ki choodi’ was about human greed for gold, exploited craftily by a lion while animals steered clear of all those machinations. “The humans learnt their lessons the hard way and had a narrow escape,” said Pratima Jain who was present at the venue on Friday along with her two children. “These are the stories read and heard so many times, yet to watch the narration by puppets was truly magical. And the underlying message definitely registered; I am bringing my children here again on the last day,” she added. The second story also veered around a cunning lion who was caged and how he fooled a pandit, by pandering to his ego. He would have eaten him up, but the man had a narrow escape helped by a clever monkey. Ritesh Sahu, a regular at Tribal Museum events, said, “The way puppets danced in the puppeteers’ hands was a sight to behold. Right from lighting to dresses worn by the puppets and smooth narration, it was an evening well spent.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/fables-forever-riveting-panchatantra-stories-narrated-at-puppet-festival/articleshow/87213312.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

The directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) conducted the raids simultaneously at 36 places — three places in Chennai, 23 in Salem, three in Namakkal, six in Musiri and one place in Coimbatore — belonging to the father and son. According to the DVAC FIR, Elangovan, who is considered a close associate of former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, and his son had invested large sums of ill-gotten wealth in colleges and institutions run by Swamy Ayyappan Educational Trust at Musiri in Trichy. Praveenkumar is the vice-chairman of the trust. Edappadi K Palaniswami, who condemned the raid, said Elangovan was Salem suburban district Amma Peravai secretary and the DVAC’s crackdown was political vendetta. During the raids, Rs 29.8 lakh cash and property documents were seized, and the agency identified 10 luxury cars, two Volvo buses, three hard discs, 21.2 kg of gold jewellery, 282.4 kg of silver ware, passbooks and property documents during the searches. “It is suspected that the accused have acquired many more assets and kept it in the name of benamis in various places in and around Tamil Nadu and outside,” the FIR stated. Elangovan has a palatial house in his native place, it said. Elangovan was elected president of Salem District Central Co-operative Bank and chairman of the TN State Apex Co-operative Bank in 2013 and was re-elected in 2018, because of which he is classified as a public servant. DVAC officials also searched the residence of Indrani Kaliya Perumal at Lalapettai in Karur district on Fridayday. Indrani is said to be a family member of Elangovan. One team of DVAC officials conducted a search at Elangovan’s auditor’s house in Salem city. DVAC FIR said assets worth Rs 3.78 crore, disproportionate to the known sources of income of Elangovan and Praveenkumar had been identified as of now. It was accumulated during a six-year check period from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2020, constituting 131% of their total income during the period, DVAC said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/21kg-gold-seized-from-co-op-bank-chief-son/articleshow/87214098.cms||---

All those getting vaccinated in the 45 vaccination centres in the zone can show their certificates with the 55 outlets to avail flat 5% discount. The civic body said that such offers are attracting people hesitating to get vaccinated. “The rewards and discounts have been helping us to convince people to an extent. A section of traders is voluntarily approaching us to support the drive. We are utilising their support,” S Selva Balaji, assistant commissioner, K Abishekapuram zone said. The civic body also creates awareness through direct interaction with people hailing from wards that have the lowest coverage. “Out of the 7.40 lakh eligible population, at least 5.40 lakh people have been vaccinated with at least one dose in the city. We are focussing the hesitant and unvaccinated population to increase the coverage,” corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rahuman, said. The commissioner added that waste collection and other vehicles were used to sensitise the residents and inform about the locations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/discount-tokens-for-jab-in-trichy-zone-today/articleshow/87214086.cms||---

Names of the eight members, some of whom were nominated by the government while others were elected, received Governor Anandiben’s stamp on Friday, making their tenure in the board final for a period of the next five years. The new board chairperson will now be elected from among these eight members, for which a notification is awaited. Bano was elected unopposed to the board earlier this year since there were no other nominations in the MP category from the eligible Shia community. There is no sitting MP from the community, following which former MPs were open to nominate themselves for the membership, however none other than Bano used the provision. From the mutawwali quota, former chairperson of the board, Waseem Rizvi and his close associate Syed Faiz who is mutawwali (caretaker) of the Talkatora Karbala in Lucknow, were elected. Elections for the board were held in April this year, after it lay defunct for nearly 10 months. Other members include Amroha's Mohammad Zaryab Jamal Rizvi and Sidharthnagar's Syed Shabahat Hussain, in the advocate quota. Maulana Raza Hussain and one Ali Zaidi from Lucknow are also new members of the board. Senior consultant at District Women Hospital, Prayagraj, Narus Hasan Naqvi, was also named a member in the Governor's notification on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/azams-rival-makes-it-to-shia-board/articleshow/87214770.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Bhopal||Fifth hike in fuel prices: Petrol zooms to Rs 115.5/litre in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Petrol prices in the state capital went past Rs 115.50 per litre with yet another hike – the fifth in the last seven days. The prices went by almost Rs 2 up since October 15. Similarly, diesel is sold in Bhopal at Rs 104.86 on October 22, up by almost Rs 2 again. The spike in international crude price forcing regular hike in the fuel prices has dampened the festive spirit of aam admi amidst the festival times. Every household has been impacted by the constant hike in fuel prices and are already burdened with its cascading impact on inflation. About a year ago on November 1, 2020, the rates of the petrol were Rs 88.76 a liter. There has been a hike of over Rs 27 on one liter of petrol in a year. Similarly, diesel was costing Rs 78.29 on November 1 in 2020. There has been an increase of over Rs 26 a liter in the same period. While the common man on the road is anguished at the repeated fuel price hike, the state government that misses no opportunity to portray itself as ‘peoples’ government’ has consistently refused to rationalize state taxes on petrol and diesel- which is among the highest in India. According to government sources, the state government collects about Rs 27.75 on every litre of petrol sold in Madhya Pradesh. This includes a cess of Rs 4.50. On the other hand, the state collects about Rs 18.75 per litre on diesel including a Rs 3 cess. While there has been demands from different quarters that the state lower taxes on fuel, it has refused to budge qand rather opposed any such move at the GST council meets. The fuel station owners meanwhile claimed that the high taxes on petrol and diesel would increase the tax collection revenue of the states like MP. “Now, the petrol pumps on the bordering districts along the states of UP, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are on the verge of closing down as the sales have declined. The reason being fuel is cheaper across the border in neighboring states. People prefer to get their vehicles refueled from pumps across the border and save some money,” they said. People will start purchasing fuel from MP once the rates go down, they reasoned. But, despite this, the state is in no mood to bring down the taxes on fuel and is willing to suffer losses with lower sales volume rather than reducing taxes on fuel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/fifth-hike-in-fuel-prices-petrol-shoots-up-to-rs-115-5/litre/articleshow/87213321.cms||---

D Sasikumar, a farmer from Thappai who along with 20 others raised the crop, said they sowed in August and had administered Atrazine herbicide in the last week of September. From the next day onwards, their entire crop began to get scorched. “We have been buying fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide from a distributor in Pullambadi. But we have encountered this situation only this time, which may be due to sub-standard quality of the herbicide. Though the distributor came forward to compensate our loss by providing Rs 9,000 an acre, all farmers did not benefit from it. I lost the crop raised on 16 out of my 20 acres. We have taken up the issue with the agriculture department,” Sasikumar said. One farmer said whenever they approach fertilizer agencies, they are compelled to buy in excess. Regional manager of Atrazine manufacturer, Rajesh, said there was nothing wrong with the herbicide as it is recommended world over for maize. “Most farmers apply Atrazine before the germination of weed. For the last few years, maize farmers have been encountering fall armyworm. Since the pest takes hold of the crop during the tender stage, farmers administer Atrazine along with pesticides, which is totally wrong,” he added. When the matter was brought to their notice, he said they tested the herbicide samples in a competent lab but had found nothing wrong in them. However, they supplied new seeds for re-sowing and fertilizer free of cost to all affected farmers. Farmers’ associations have appealed to agriculture officials to properly educate and guide farmers on the application of herbicide. N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam, said farmers are misguided by private fertilizer agencies. Hence officials should meet farmers and guide them on avoiding unwanted herbicide or pesticides.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/maize-crop-scorched-herbicide-maker-farmers-blame-each-other/articleshow/87214106.cms||---
---||Trichy||CM writes to Centre on low fertilizer supply||Trichy: Chief minister M K Stalin has sought the intervention of Union fertilizers minister Mansukh L Mandaviya to resolve the short supply of fertilizers to Tamil Nadu. In a letter to the minister, he demanded supply of urea, DAP and MOP according to the monthly agreed supply plan. He said kuruvai (khariff) paddy coverage in the delta had surpassed 4.9 lakh acres this year, the highest in 46 years. Major reservoirs were opened after several years which helped the state cover an area of more than 10 lakh acres under paddy, which was 2.72 lakh acres higher than last year. Prospects are bright for samba (rabi) season also due to the monsoon. Hence, the demand for all fertilizers, particularly urea, has increased, Stalin stated. To meet this demand, the Government of India supplied 4.911 lakh tonne of urea for April to September. “But, I wish to point out that fertilizer companies have so far supplied 3.852 lakh tonne only, leaving a shortfall of 1.059 lakh tonne. Similarly, the supply plan for DAP for the above said period is 1.47 lakh tonnes of which fertilizer companies supplied 1.15 lakh tonnes, leaving a shortfall of 32,000 tonnes,” he said. “Any shortfall in supply of urea and DAP will drastically affect the crop yield and in turn income of the farmers,” he added. He requested to instruct officials to ensure timely supply of the entire urea according to the supply plan and additional 25,000 tonnes of DAP and 10,000 tonnes of MOP to Tamil Nadu to meet the increasing demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/cm-writes-to-centre-on-low-fertilizer-supply/articleshow/87214116.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 32 more in dengue grip, hospitals run short of beds||LUCKNOW: With 32 more confirmed and 40 suspected dengue cases recorded in the city on Friday, the second wave of the vector-borne disease triggered by rainfall earlier this week is now threatening to overwhelm hospitals. The number of confirmed cases on Friday was the highest in a day this year, taking the case load to 761. Of this, 681 cases have been reported since September 1. Dengue wards in most big government hospitals were almost full due to the current surge. Altogether, around 200 fever cases have been reported daily at SPM Civil Hospital, Lokbandhu Hospital, Balrampur Hospital, KGMU and private hospitals since Tuesday. Of these, at least 100 patients daily were diagnosed with ‘suspected dengue’ through the card test method. Among these, around 20 patients confirmed to be having dengue through the ELISA method are being hospitalised daily because of low platelet count or other complications. As a result, 42 out of 50 beds reserved for dengue patients in Lokbandhu Hospital were occupied on Friday. Similarly, 20-bedded dengue wards in Balrampur and SPM Civil hospitals were almost full. Officials said that there is no need to panic as an equal number of patients are also recovering and being discharged daily from hospitals. Around 10% of the hospitalised patients need platelet transfusion. As patients are getting treatment timely, so far, only one dengue death has been reported, they added. The first dengue surge was witnessed after heavy rains on September 16 in which many areas were waterlogged. The puddles thus created served as havens for mosquito breeding. Fresh rainfall on Sunday and Monday led to another surge. Experts said that people should not allow water to accumulate in and around their houses and civic authorities should carry out anti-mosquito drive on war-footing. Director of Lokbandhu Hospital Dr Ajay Tripathi said, “The situation is under control, but we have reserved more beds.” Balrampur Hospital director Dr Alok Srivastava said, “Most patients are coming on time, hence so far there has been no case of dengue shock syndrome, which can be fatal. We have also more beds.” Civil hospital chief medical superintendent Dr SK Nanda said that many patients are recovering daily, hence there is no crisis. The hospital is arranging 30 additional beds for dengue cases. President of Private Hospitals’ Association Dr Anoop Agrawal said, “There is a surge in fever cases including dengue. Patients who come with serious fatigue and low platelet count are being admitted.” 10 patients hospitalised Ten of the 32 confirmed dengue patients on Friday were serious and had to be hospitalised due to low platelet count. The remaining are recuperating at home. Most of the fresh cases came from hotspots of Indiranagar, Aliganj, Alambagh, Turiyaganj, Malihabad, NK Road, Chinhat and Kakori. Meanwhile, the larvae of Aedes aegypti, the dengue carrier, were found in 32 houses during a drive by the health department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/32-more-in-dengue-grip-hosps-run-short-of-beds/articleshow/87214778.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Bhopal||Bhopal receives 200 e-applications for cracker shops||BHOPAL: District administration has so far received 200-odd online applications for opening of retail crackers shops on Diwali. On-an-average 500 to 600 vendors are given licence for opening of shops every year. Unlike the previous years, the district administration this year has started an online process for renewal of licences and issuing fresh licences to vendors. As far as guidelines for use of firecrackers on Diwali is concerned, it's going to be the same as the previous year based on guidelines laid down by the supreme court and the NGT. ADM, Dileep Yadav, when asked whether 200 applications from entire Bhopal with two to three days left for applying does not suggest that cracker shops this Diwali may be far less than usual, said "No. They all apply in the last few days. We are expecting the same number of shops as in the past." In most of the cases, the temporary licences are renewed by the administration for a month. But, the vendors do firecracker business for a fortnight. The retail shops at designated places like the Bittan Market Dussehra ground are likely to open by October 30 or 31. The administration gets a layout made by the BMC of the ground where the temporary firecracker market comes up and the shops are allotted through lottery, said Yadav. Apart from precautions, the vendors would be asked to take to avoid any untoward incident, they would also be expected to take Covid precautions and regulate the crowd of buyers in a manner that social distancing is maintained. During Diwali last year, the corona situation was bad. On-an-average, cases in excess of 200 were being detected in the district every day on samples in the range of 2,000 to 2,500, indicating nearly 10% infection rate. The situation is far better this year with 4 to 5 cases being detected every day on a sample size of 5,500 to 6,000. With the 100% population of the district having received at least the first dose of vaccine, people are far more confident and festive spirit is back among the people. In the changed situation, fireworks will be allowed but in the wake of Covid pandemic the guidelines on timings and the kind of crackers that can be used as laid down by the Supreme Court would obviously be followed. The district administration was also very particular in not allowing sale of Chinese or imported crackers last year, Yadav when asked whether crackdown against sale of Chinese or imported crackers would continue said yes it won't be allowed. Besides, sale of only factory manufactured packed crackers would be allowed. Timing for the fireworks is likely to be two hours- 8.00pm to 10.00pm Talking to TOI, owner of Taj Patakha Bhandar, a wholesaler, had said that sale of crackers has been dull and even the retailers are not coming to buy crackers but with the process of licencing in the last leg, the sales of crackers is likely to pick up because firecrackers from wholesale market is not only sold in Bhopal but goes to adjacent districts as well, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/200-e-applications-received-for-retail-crackers-shops-licence/articleshow/87213343.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

He was speaking at an election rally in Dighora, part of Prithvipur assembly segment, in the afternoon on Friday. Preceding the announcement, he said in his inimitable style of oratory, Congress everyday lodges complaints that “I violate election model code of conduct.” He emphasized on the word violate. Placing both his hands at his chest, he then said, “kal mein kisano ke khate mein dedh hazar crore daal raha hun.” (Tomorrow I am transferring Rs 1500 cr in the accounts of the farmers”. As if he was challenging the Congress, he continued, “tomorrow at 11.30 am, in one click Mama will transfer Rs 1,500 crore in your account.” After losing Damoh by election in March this year, the BJP has put all its resources in the four by-elections to be held in MP in Raigaon (Satna), Jobat (Alirajpur), Prithvipur in Niwari and the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat.

Shivraj said Modi ji was giving Rs 6,000 for the Mukhya Mantri Kisan Kalyan Yojana and in these trying times, Rs 6,000 or Rs 4,000 was less. “Whether it is one acre farmer or the one who owns half acre, Modi ji has given Rs 6,000 so I thought Mama you have become CM for the fourth time so I decided to give Rs 4,000 more,” he said amidst thunderous applause. He said that only yesterday he had increased DA to 20 for the government servants. Now the money held back after the hike in salaries will be cleared in two installments, he said.

While kumkis Shankar and Krishna were engaged in monitoring Vinayakan on Thursday, Murthi, Jambu, Wasim and Ganesh were sent to Bosepara area of MTR to join the operation on Friday. Vinayakan had destroyed eight houses and a large extent of crops in farmlands in the last one month, a forest department official said. “The six kumkis are engaged in monitoring the movement of Vinayakan in Bosepara area and drive him to the deep forest. The kumkis would also see that the elephant does not return to the village,” said forest range officer Rajendran. Vinayakan used to be a crop raider in the Coimbatore forest division. He was tranquilized and captured from Thadagam valley in 2018 and was shifted to MTR. However, even in MTR, he used to stray into farmlands located at the boundary of the reserve and damage crops.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mayor to get rented building as official residence for now||Thiruvananthapuram: As the city corporation grapples with local protest against ‘mayor’s bhavan’ project at Kunnukuzhy, the state government has given sanction to civic bodies to utilize their own funds to take buildings on rent to be used as official residence of the mayor. The government issued an order based on a letter from Thiruvananthapuram city corporation secretary. As per the order, the maximum permissible rent for the building shall be Rs 15,000 and onetime expense of Rs 1 lakh will be sanctioned for deposit, furnishing and maintenance expense. This can be met from their own fund. The furniture and other items being bought for the rented residence shall be treated as corporation’s assets. Mayor will have to bear the cost of water and electricity. The city corporation council held in July had witnessed a heated debate over the mayor’s bhavan project with the UDF councillors sternly objecting to the project. Mayor’s bhavan was a regular feature in corporation budgets until the initial work began in 2018. A sketch was prepared during the tenure of the previous council and work was awarded recently. However, it has been stalled owing to local protests. Mayor’s bhavan was conceived to house the official residence of mayor, a conference hall, a guest house, office room and a chamber for the mayors of other civic bodies. The government order has been issued mainly considering the need of the Thiruvananthapuram corporation and guidelines have been issued in a general context. At present Mayor Arya Rajendran resides in a rented house. There has been a demand for a building with adequate facilities for the public to visit, to hold meetings and to be used as the official residence. The city corporation had long dragged its feet on realizing the mayor's bhavan project and the project sites had to be changed in the past. Kozhikode has an official residence for the city mayor. The government order says that the corporation heads face a lot of difficulties due to lack of official residences. “People often visit the mayor before and after office hours and necessity arises for holding various official and unofficial meetings even after and before office hours and absence of an official residence makes it difficult for the mayors,” the order cited. The corporation secretary had highlighted the various purposes of official residence and permission was sought for taking a residence on rent and the amount that could be spent from the own fund was also mentioned in the letter. The residence can be used till the end of tenure of the council or till the corporation constructs its own building. Given the approved cost, it will be a challenge for the corporation authorities to find a suitable building within the city limits and close to the corporation office.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mayor-to-get-rented-building-as-official-residence-for-now/articleshow/87192469.cms||Aswin J Kumar

According to data provided by the health department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), the city has so far reported 87 cases of dengue in October, against 256 cases in September and 311 positive cases in August. The tally of dengue positive cases — between January 1 and October 21 — in Nashik city has gone up to 920. “Dengue positive cases have significantly dropped in the current month due to various measures taken by the health department,” an NMC official said. “Cases had increased in the months of August and September due to gaps between rains that led to accumulation of water in open spaces and premises of residential and commercial buildings. But the rains are now over. Moreover, we have already taken measures like destroying mosquito breeding spots, increasing spraying and other activities to prevent spread of dengue,” he added. The NMC had also roped in a social outfit to destroy mosquito breeding spots in the city. The social outfit concerned had provided 100 employees only for destroying mosquito breeding spots. Around 5,000 mosquito breeding spots were destroyed by them in the first half of October. The civic body had also conducted a drive to collect used tyres. During the drive, the NMC teams managed to collect and destroy over 1,000 tyres. Apart from this, the NMC has also started slapping fines on people responsible for creation of mosquito breeding spots.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/drop-in-dengue-cases-in-nashik/articleshow/87211827.cms||Tushar Pawar

Candidates had a tough time in locking their subject choices due to the snag. “I struggled for hours to lock my subject choices as the website was not working properly. Even after multiple attempts, I could not proceed even to the second step of fee submission,” said MSc candidate Aradhya Shukla. Another candidate, Jyotsna Singh, said: “The last date for submission of fee is October 24. If this problem continues, it would be difficult for us to timely submit the fee.” “A message showing ‘error while processing the request’ kept on flashing on my computer screen. If it is so tough for us to lock seats online even after using high-speed internet, students from rural areas must be having a tough time,” she said. “Online payment of fees through the admission portal was not working at all in the afternoon. Later in the evening, I could pay the fees but the entire process was very cumbersome,” said Vedika Somvanshi, a candidate for MA course. “LU has given the responsibility of maintenance of admission portal to a private vendor which is not able to provide good services. As a large number of candidates are using the admission portal, the website is crashing more often. The admission team has directed the vendor to fix the problem,” a source at the university said. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said the admission team had not received any complaint regarding any glitch on admission portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/technical-glitch-hits-lu-pg-counselling-process/articleshow/87214824.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Proof of illicit trafficking of drugs in Armaan Kohli case’||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting actor Armaan Kohli’s bail plea, a special NDPS court has said that prima facie, it transpires that he is well-connected with the co-accused pertaining to illicit trafficking of drugs. “Prima facie such material relating to illicit trafficking in connivance is brought on record by the prosecution,” the special judge said. The court further said although investigations are at a nascent stage, chats submitted by the prosecution, if corroborated with the bank transactions, match approximately with the figures in the transactions. The court held it is evident stringent sections of the NDPS Act are duly invoked “pursuant to” Kohli’s involvement in financing illicit trafficking and harbouring offenders. While the court rejected the bail plea on October 14, the detailed order copy was made available on Thursday. Kohli was arrested in August.  The court said the accused had failed to explain the very purpose of possessing such contraband (1.2 grams of MD), which is recovered from his house, and the financial transactions. The prosecution had submitted that apart from the recovery of contraband, “shocking, incriminating material” was found from Kohli’s mobile phone. It is further stated there are links in the form of pictures, chats, etc which propagate an international drug and prostitution cartel. The court refuted the defence argument that pictures or videos were sent from the mobile of co-accused without Kohli’s consent or knowledge. The court said that on perusal of chats and messages, it is evident it is not the case that merely the pictures or videos were sent to him. “On the contrary many times those were responded by the accused,” the court said. The court also said Kohli could have complained to police authorities if they were sent without his consent. The court also said that the quantity of the contraband won’t be quintessential for grant of bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-proof-of-illicit-trafficking-of-drugs-in-armaan-kohli-case/articleshow/87214177.cms||Rebecca Samervel

ASA members said that Panjab University received a grant from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for construction of hostels for SC/ST students. Under the scheme, they said, the university had to construct 120 rooms for the said students. However, they alleged that the grant was used for construction of hostels for women research scholars. They said the university also utilised the grant received from the UGC for construction of two hostels, one for girls and another for boys with capacity of 120 each, for the purpose. One of the student leader of ASA said, “We have written to Panjab University authorities many times to implement this scheme but university authorities never bothered to help the said community. Now, the university has again decided to send a proposal to the Government of India for construction of hostel for SC/ST students ‘under Babu Jagjivan Ram Chhatrawas Yojana (BJRCY) .’ This is commendable but we again request to implement these welfare schemes in letter and spirit.” They also said they did not want segregated hostels for SC/ST SC students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/asa-demands-hostel-seats-for-sc/st-students-in-pu/articleshow/87213383.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Banana export to open new vistas for UP farmers’||Lucknow: The bananas dispatched for Iran from Lucknow on October 14 have reached Mumbai and will reach the destination in the next few days. If the shipment meets the quality compliance parameters on reaching Iran, it will open new markets for bananas-growers of UP. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) AGM CB Singh said the shipment is being tracked at every step. “The outcome of the first-ever export of bananas from the state will help us formulate the strategy and standard operating procedure (SOP) for banana export which will then be adopted in all banana-producing districts,” Singh said. Two containers carrying 40 metric tonnes of bananas sourced from farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri were sent for export from Malihabad pack house last week. APEDA has already started training banana growers in Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Varanasi and Barabanki to grow export quality fruit as in Lakhimpur Kheri. “We will have export quality bananas ready by July next year,” said Singh. Apart from quality compliance, cost effectiveness will also be reviewed by APEDA for the trial shipment of bananas. The cost of exporting a container of bananas from UP works out between Rs 12 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, which is higher than that of big banana exporting states like Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The banana largely grown in UP is the G-9 (Grand Naine) variety, which is internationally approved for export. The variety is grown in other states also but the one in UP is more viable given various agro-climatic factors and longer shelf life. The shipment of the raw bananas exported to Iran was of the same variety and had a shelf life of more than 20 days and is expected to reach in 15 days. “The bananas should remain raw till they reach the destination. That’s a challenge and test of quality. If it ripens, it will spoil,” said Singh. “A special packaging, Modified Atmospheric Packaging (MAP), which does not let the fruit ripen, was used. Before packaging, it was duly treated to prevent any infection,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/banana-export-to-open-new-vistas-for-up-farmers/articleshow/87214825.cms||Neha Shukla

The project grant worth Rs 16 lakh has been given for research work during the year 2021-22 to stdy the portrayal of women on Gujarati over-the-top (OTT) platform. A multi-fold research approach with audience opinion, expert insights, and analysis of web series on this platform has been chosen for the study. The proposal to NCW was sent collaboratively under the theme — ‘Gender inequality in media and entertainment industry’. This was one among the four themes relating to gender issues on which NCW had invited proposals earlier this year. “We are excited to commence this study which will most definitely contribute to knowledge in the domain of gender and media, especially streaming platforms, which are becoming popular by the day,” said professor Shagufa Kapadia from HDFS and principal investigator for the project. “This collaborative association will also help strengthen multi-disciplinary research, as envisioned by NEP 2020,” said professor Niti Chopra, FJC dean and co-investigator. The research team members include Dr Subair Kalathil, programme officer in Women’s Studies Research Centre, Dr Nidhi Shendurnikar, assistant professor in FJC and Dr Gitanjali Roy, assistant professor from the Department of Psychology of Faculty of Education and Psychology.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/msu-to-study-portrayal-of-women-on-gujarati-ott-platform/articleshow/87212736.cms||---

The quarry will now be used to dump waste from the city. The development has come five years after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had approved the KMC’s request to dump the waste there, ensuring no environmental laws are violated at the site. In 2005, the district administration had allowed the civic body to dump the waste generated in the city in the quarry, but the issue went to the court owing to stiff opposition from the locals. Vijay Patil, solid waste management incharge of KMC, said, “The land survey department has fixed the boundaries and now the KMC has exclusive rights over the quarry. We will develop it as scientific landfilling site in a couple of years and then start using it for dumping waste. The quarry can accomodate waste for the next 30 years.” The KMC will now appoint a consultant to prepare the quarry as landfilling site. Scientific approach has to be approved to develop the site so that no water, soil or air pollution occurs. The KMC is going to develop the site in phases depending on the availability of funds. Civic officials claimed initially funds from 14th finance commission can be utilised to appoint the consultant, draft project report and raise the 6 feet wall as mandated by the NGT. “Once the project details are finalised we will seek funds through Swachh Bharat Mission. Since the quarry is big, we may have to ensure it is developed and utilised in phases mainly due to huge requirement of funds,” said Patil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kmc-gets-possession-of-quarry-at-top-village-for-dumping-citys-waste/articleshow/87211847.cms||---

The police identified the accused as Anshad of Pazhavila near Nedumangad. Salim of Manja is the complainant in the case. The police said the incident related to the case took place on Tuesday evening. Anshad was married to Salim's daughter and the couple were living separately for the past several months owing to marital discord. However, Anshad used to visit his in-law's place occasionally to see his children who lived with their mother. Recently, his wife moved to Idukki after securing a job. Anshad was not happy about it and accused Salim for this which led to a quarrel between them. During the melee, Anshad grabbed a rock lying in the courtyard of the house and bashed it on the head of Salim inflicting serious injuries. Anshad’s arrest was recorded by a team led by Nedumangad station house officer, inspector Santhosh Kumar and sub inspector Sunik Gopi under the instructions of Nedumangad ASP R J Prasad. The accused was subsequently produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody. The entire case was very similar to the twin murder of a father and son reported at Mudavanmugal in the city a week ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/40-yr-old-arrested-for-murder-attempt/articleshow/87192501.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 22-year-old is supplier to Aryan in drugs case, says NCB, opposes bail||Mumbai: Opposing the bail plea of Aachit Kumar in the NCB case related to its raid on a cruise ship on October 2, the prosecution submitted he is the supplier to co-accused Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant and, hence, a peddler. Special public prosecutor Advait M Sethna submitted there was admitted recovery of 2.6 grams of ganja from Kumar (22) on October 6. “Thus, the allegation of being innocent and that he has not committed any offence is untrue, misleading and mischievous,” Sethna told court. He added Kumar had portrayed “a fine smokescreen or mirror of innocence.” The prosecution said the court, in its order rejecting Khan’s bail plea, had observed he was regularly dealing with narcotic substances. “That should apply to Aachit as he is supplier,” the prosecution said. The prosecution said investigators have so far revealed Kumar was a peddler who supplied them with ganja or charas. The prosecution said there is corroborating material which connects Kumar with Khan and Merchant. “See bulk quantity reference in that material. Present applicant with accused number one (Khan). See bulk order reference. Material shows it cannot be a mere coincidence that you are expressing yourself in a particular manner when contraband, drug, bulk quantity is involved. Everybody today knows consequences and serious repercussions when you consume contraband,” Sethna said. He also argued the law does not give a clean chit to consumption. “ If there are certain conversations, they are brought on record. Whether these conversations have evidentiary value is a matter of trial. However, these are important to corroborate certain facts,” Sethna said. He denied allegations Kumar was illegally detained before being shown as arrested. “We have nothing to do personally with anybody. This (arrest) is on basis of follow-up action in responsible investigations,” he added. Opposing the plea of accused Manish Rajgaria (30), a guest on the ship arrested on October 4 with allegedly 2.4 gm of ganja when the ship was returning from Goa to Mumbai, Sethna denied there was any irregularity in the panchanama.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-22-year-old-is-supplier-to-aryan-in-drugs-case-says-ncb-opposes-bail/articleshow/87214184.cms||Rebecca Samervel

This means that a total of 200 hospital staff members have not been immunised. Sources in GMCH 32 said that staff members with vaccine hesitancy include those in the administration, nurses, technicians and hospital attendants. Director-principal, GMCH 32, Prof Jasbinder Kaur refused to comment on this. UT health department data shows that more than 100% healthcare workers in the city have been vaccinated. “How can there be more than 100% coverage for HCWs here when we know that some of the GMCH staff members have not even had their first dose?” asked a nursing staff member in GMCH. There were around 31,000 registered HCWs in the city from private and government hospitals and clinics. “As vaccination is not mandatory, we cannot ask everyone to get a jab without consent. However, as HCWs are the most exposed and were in the first priority of vaccination, 200 persons not being vaccinated at all means a lot,” said a doctor in GMCH 32. He added, “An HCW must be vaccinated as they come in close contact with patients who have low immunity. If an HCW is not vaccinated, not only is he unprotected, a patient is also exposed in the hospital setting.” Vaccination in the city started on January 16 with HCWs as the first priority group. “This category was the most reluctant when vaccination started. We started counselling and motivating them and most of them came forward after that,” said a faculty in GMCH 32.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/at-gmch-10-staff-yet-to-get-first-vaccine-dose/articleshow/87213388.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The complainant said that on September 13, he was working in his office when he received a call from the accused using abusive language. The HC bench of Justice Nitin Sambre said “The applicant appears to have used most filthy language, words thereby abusing … after his mother etc on phone and further threatened him of assault by visiting his office.” The HC said that the “least that was expected” of the councillor was to understand the problems of civic staff and find solution to issues. “The conduct of the applicant, an elected representative, is nothing short of demoralising the officers and trying to establish his supremacy,” said the HC. The accused’s lawyers claimed he was “falsely implicated.” The HC stated, “Perusal of the contents in the FIR depicts that the freedom of speech, exercised by the applicant is in most indecent manner and speaks of his complete violent, power hungry act.” It added that the law applies with equal force to an elected representative as it is to the other citizens. “There is no immunity conferred on the applicant under the provisions of the criminal law.” The HC said no case of relief was made out and rejected the plea made by the councillor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-no-relief-from-high-court-for-councillor-who-abused-staff/articleshow/87214203.cms||---

Criticising the merit system for admissions at a time when results were announced on the basis of an assessment formula, they said tests should have been conducted by the colleges for a fair admission process. Students shared that earlier they didn’t have plans to get enrolled in local colleges and universities, but now they don’t have any option. “I was on cloud nine when I scored 98.2% in class XII. I had never thought that my dream to pursue BSc (computer science) at Hansraj College will not be fulfilled even after scoring so well. In its first cut-off list, the college has declared a 100% cut off for admission to BSc. It has shaken my chances for getting a seat,” said a student Anuj Singh. He said with seven colleges of Delhi University declaring 100% cut off in various undergraduate courses it will be tough for students like him to get a college or to get subjects of their choice at their dream institute. “I will just wait for the second cut off list. Thereafter if the percentage does not fall further I will take admission in BSc in Lucknow University.” Another 98.1% scorer Deepti Sinha, who wanted to pursue BSc at Kirorimal college, said, “I even thought of changing my stream. But the situation remains the same as students who have got 99% or more have also sought admissions in science, commerce and humanities courses of top colleges.” She said in Kirorimal College for BSc (mathematics) cut-off is 99.75% and the same is for admission to BA (political science) at Indraprastha College for Women, while for BA hons at Kamla Nehru College also one needs 99%. “Earlier I was not considering local options for higher studies and had filled in just as a backup option at LU and Isabella Thoburn College. Now, I will take admission in any one of them.” Anhinav Upreti, who has secured 98%, shared that he will be joining engineering at some good engineering college as with 100% cut off for BSc (computer science) at Hansraj College and again a 100% cut off for admission in BSc (physics) at Ramjas College has shattered his dreams of studying at the two colleges. “I know I won’t be able to make it as the required percentage won’t drop. A number of students from state boards like Kerala Board of Higher Secondary Education have got full 100%. Thus they would get admission easily,” said Abhinav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/100-cut-offs-shatter-toppers-dream-for-du-admission/articleshow/87214845.cms||---

Thokal, having criminal record, was externed from Pune district for two years in July. On Wednesday night, a Pimpri police team received a tip-off during patrolling that he had violated the externment order. “The police team led by sub-inspector Sachin Suryavanshi immediately reached near Thokal’s house in Pimpri,” said an officer from the Pimpri police. Seeing the police team, Thokal started running away. “When Band nabbed him after a brief chase, Thokal abused the former. He even pushed Band.

---||Coimbatore||Day care centres and playschools operate unofficially as demand goes up||As offices and commercial establishments have reopened with the sliding down of the number of Covid-19 cases, day care centres and playschools have started operating in and around the city unofficially following demand from working parents. Though the state government is yet to make any announcement allowing them to operate, these day care centres and playschools are taking the risk of capitalizing on the increasing demand. Despite the apprehension of possible action from authorities, they are operating after suffering losses for being shut for the last 18 months. S Mahesh, 35, of Thudiyalur, had to bear with multiple pay cuts due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns for the past one and half years. To make ends meet, his wife decided to work from last month. But the couple was clueless about taking care of their 3-year-old son while both were at work. A nearby playschool came in for their rescue. Their son is now one among the six children of working parents in the locality whom the day care centre cum playschool is taking care of. “We could witness an increase in enquiries from parents for children in the age group of 3-6 years after speculations on reopening of playschools. But now the decision has been reversed,” a woman who is running a playschool at Saravanampatti said. “If I don’t admit the children, they may go to other playschools. To retain them, we have no option but to admit. We have no other option than to keep the playschool running amidst mounting debts. We are ready to follow the guidelines and conditions if the government allows us to reopen,” she said. “Parents cannot teach their children like teachers,” G Mridula, a parent from Balaji Gardens at Kovilpalayam, said. Mridula had admitted her three-year-old kid to a playschool this year. Founder director of Peepal Prodigy School, Coimbatore, K Kumaraguru said without a foundation on reading and writing skills which are essentially taught in playschools, admitting students to Class I will not do good for children. Moreover, working parents are contributing to the speedy recovery of the economy and the government should allow playschools to reopen, he said. District chief education officer N Geetha said that she has been receiving requests from playschools seeking permission for reopening. She said the playschools that are operating unofficially might land in trouble if even one child tests positive for Covid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/day-care-centres-and-playschools-operate-unofficially-as-demand-goes-up/articleshow/87214188.cms||Sampath Kumar

The body of the boy, Y Aneesh, was found floating in the water at 11.30 am on Friday with his dress near the site. Police suspect that the boy might have gone into the water for swimming and drowned. Aneesh was in class 2 and has two siblings. His father is a software professional, Rajendranagar police said. The search for the boy had begun on Thursday evening after parents lodged a missing complaint. A kidnap case was registered after police verified CCTV footage and did not find the boy leaving the premises.

---||Kochi||Compensation to flood-hit will be paid without delay: Minister||Thrissur: Revenue minister K Rajan on Friday said that there would not be any delay in disbursement of compensation to the recent flood victims. Speaking after visiting the relief camps in the district, the minister said the government was considering the possibilities of giving additional relief from the chief minister’s distress relief fund to those who have suffered losses in the flood, apart from the assistance from the state distress relief fund (SDRF). The government can only sanction less than Rs 1 lakh from the SDRF for a house destroyed in the flood. This compensation level can be augmented to about Rs 4 lakh from the CM’s relief fund, the minister said. Rajan said this proposal was likely to be discussed in the next cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday. The government has provided support to the bed-ridden patients who are now in relief camps. The minister said the district collectors have been asked to coordinate the preliminary relief distribution works on a war footing. The government will provide enough funds for this. “The revenue officials at various levels have been asked to assess the property losses in the flood, in collaboration with the engineers in the local body institutions. The officials have been asked to expedite the preparation of the assessment of the level of losses of their properties, including houses, as well as in the agricultural sector, so that the distribution of compensation can be expedited. The government will take appropriate steps based on their reports,” he said. The minister said the government will explore the methods to be adopted to distribute compensation to those who have suffered in the floods, even though they did not have any documents. Rajan also said that even though the respite in the rain since Thursday has reduced the flood threats for the time being there should not be any lowering of guard. The IMD has forecast heavy rains again, till October 26, under the influence of the trough that has formed over the Arabian Sea. Hill ranges are the most vulnerable areas as the earth there is already wet and will become prone to landslides if there are heavy showers again. The state has already received more rains than the expected levels in this season. It was for the first time in recent years that the northeast monsoon was likely to set in in Kerala on the same day the southwest monsoon is leaving, he said. The minister said Kerala government has communicated to the Tamil Nadu authorities over the manner in which the discharge of water from Parambikulam is being handled. Rajan gave this clarification following reports that abrupt release of water from Parambikulam dam by Tamil Nadu, without maintaining flood cushion, was aggravating flood threats in Chalakkudy area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/compensation-to-flood-hit-will-be-paid-without-delay-minister/articleshow/87213437.cms||---

The Covid situation would be assessed in the week after Diwali,” he said. Theatres, cinema and auditoriums opened at 50% capacity in the state on Friday. Ajit Pawar said the demand of the owners of such facilities to allow them to operate with 100% capacity would be considered post-Diwali by the chief minister only if the cases continued to decline. After conducting the weekly Covid review meeting of Pune district, the deputy chief minister said India’s feat of achieving one billion vaccinations was the outcome of the efforts of the planners and the health fraternity. “Maharashtra has achieved nearly 10 crore vaccinations, which is 10% of the national vaccination tally. Pune district’s tally of administering 1.17 crore doses is 12% of the state’s average,” he said. The district’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) was below 5% for all the three administrative units this week, too. It was 2.7% this week as against last week’s 2.9%. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas registered a WPR of 2% and it was 1.8% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. In Pune rural, it was 3.2%. All the three administrative units registered a dip in WPR from the last week. The deputy chief minister said efforts to scale up the vaccination in the district would continue. The local authorities would be reaching out to housing societies and two-shift weekly vaccination drives would be conducted in all the rural areas till October 31. “In the last fortnight, a significant 9% increase was registered in the overall vaccinations,” he said. Ajit Pawar gives nod to host Diwali Pahat programmes Deputy CM Ajit Pawar on Friday gave permission to conduct Diwali Pahat programmes, as suggested by the elected representatives. Gardens would be allowed to be used for Diwali Pahat. Directives were issued to the municipal commissioner in this regard. Weekly markets in the rural areas, too, were allowed. The district collector was directed to issue orders for the same.

---||Thane||Thane jail no to taking in police in explosives case||MUMBAI: Thane jail authorities have opposed taking former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma in Thane jail prompting him to withdraw his plea in the special NIA court seeking transfer from Taloja jail. “If they don’t want us, we don’t want to go there,” his lawyer Harshad Ponda said. Sharma is a co-accused along with dismissed cop Sachin Waze in the planting of gelatines in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow, Antilia and the subsequent murder of the vehicle owner, Mansukh Hiran. Sharma (59) had moved the plea earlier this month, citing security concerns. The court also heard extensive arguments on Sharma’s home food application. Ponda cited various ailments including diabetes, arthritis and asthma and said that Sharma needed bland food. He said that it was his fundamental right. Ponda also submitted that Sharma was suffering from abdominal pain for the last three months and this had aggravated, forcing him to go to JJ Hospital. Opposing the plea, among various grounds the prosecution also expressed fears that the food could be poisoned. “The food cannot be checked every time. He is a high-risk prisoner,” the prosecution said. It also claimed that diseases cited were common ailments and special food could also be made available in jail. The prosecution also submitted that jail food could not be sub-standard as it was inspected by judges. The prosecution also refuted that it was not a fundamental right of the accused and said it was up to the discretion of the court. Ponda, in his response, said, “ They want to treat Sharma like an animal.” He added that from the beginning, NIA has acted in a mischievous fashion. The court will hear the plea next week. The special NIA court on Friday also rejected a plea by Waze, seeking default bail on grounds that the chargesheet was delayed. The court also rejected the bail plea made by dismissed cop Sunil Mane. The NIA had opposed both their pleas. The NIA, in its reply, had said that Waze’s plea should be rejected and heavy cost imposed on him in the interest of justice. The court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet submitted on September 3. The NIA has, in its reply, said that the chargesheet was submitted much before the date of the outer limit of the stipulated time to file it. The NIA said that by then the custody of the accused, including Waze, was already extended by 30 days which could come to an end on September 6.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/thane-jail-no-to-taking-in-cop-in-explosives-case/articleshow/87214218.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The university, in its circular issued on Wednesday, said that the final-year results have already been declared and the students need to clear their belongings latest by October 23, failing which the management will collect all belongings and put them in a common luggage room. Any loss of belongings from there will be entirely the students’ responsibility and not the management’s, it added. Sachin Ballal, rector of the university hostels and also an assistant professor at the department of mathematics, said, “There are 18 hostels under the university. About 200 boys and 100 girls have not taken away their belongings even though they have graduated. The university has already issued 5-6 circulars since telling the students to clear their things from the hostel rooms assigned to them but there are still some who have not done so,” Ballal said. The university gets many students from across the country and outside and many take up residence in the university hostels owing to its proximity to the lecture halls and departments. Ballal said that these students may have genuine reasons for not being able to turn up, but the university needs to start preparing the hostels for the upcoming term. “We need to clean up and sanitise the hostels for the next batch. We have still not opened these rooms as the students have locked up their rooms. However, past the deadline, we may need to open these rooms and collect the belongings and keep them in the common room so that these rooms too can be prepared,” Ballal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/300-former-sppu-students-yet-to-take-away-belongings-from-hostel-rooms/articleshow/87192520.cms||Ardhra Nair

There has been an increase in demand for fogging by residents, especially in dengue-affected areas. According to Government of India guidelines, indoor residual spray (IRS), focal spray and use of larvicidal chemicals in outdoor mosquitogenic situations are the preferred method of treatment for mosquito breeding as these have a residual effect which persists for considerable time after treatment. Fogging is to be resorted to only for an outbreak control situation. It should be used only for epidemic containment as a temporary, contingent supplement to other epidemic prevention and containment measures. It must be used only for a limited period of time in a clearly identified area. Fogging is not a preferred option for vector control and needs to be discouraged as a routine method. Fogging has been listed as the last option in chemical control methods because of the limitations associated. Routine fogging, besides being ineffective, is also harmful to health and hazardous to vulnerable and at-risk groups. Stay of fog is temporary in the environment with no residual effect. The effect is primarily on adult mosquitoes which come in contact with the fog and get knocked out. Moreover, the effect on the mosquitoes is highly dependent on climatic factors like wind velocity and its direction, humidity and temperature. It is not advisable in peak of summers when the temperature is very high. Fogging is effective only during dusk and dawn.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/fogging-to-be-done-only-as-last-resort-ut-admn/articleshow/87213434.cms||---

Although I did not get injured, my Activa had to be repaired,” he added. Kumar, did his MBA from Osmania University and had been staying in Hyderabad for the past 8 years. He said that after the lockdown norms were relaxed a little, he obtained epass and travelled to his hometown and from there to Chennai. “This trip gave me the confidence to travel further. Subsequently, I went from Hyderabad to Goa on my Activa and camped there for 15 days. After this, from Hyderabad, I covered Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Goa,” he added. Kumar said that he prefers budget travel and carries everything that he might need. “I stayed in hotels for just four days,” he added. Explaining about the toughest part of his journey from Hyderabad to Ladakh, he said “It was completely off-roading at the 60km stretch near Tso Moriri lake. The maximum speed I could attain during the journey at stretch was 10km/hr,” he said adding that while he could travel for about 12 hours generally, at Himalayan Range, he could hardly cover 200 km to 250 km in a day. The 30-year-old, said that his night halt was mostly near petrol bunks, toll plazas or in a village. “I never stayed in isolated places. Also, during my journey, I met various travelling groups,” he said adding that his next trip will be to North-East. Kumar, who took up several part-time jobs including teaching, customer care representative, among others, said that he never took up a full-time job as he is afraid that it will not allow him to travel much. “My passion for travel is also the reason why I am not married yet, although there is pressure from my family,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/a-hyderabadi-his-scooter-brave-treacherous-route-reach-ladakh/articleshow/87214254.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Efforts will be made to conduct term-end examinations in the offline mode for the next semester wherever possible for which students need to attend offline classes which requires full vaccination, he said. “Mission Yuva Swasthya is a collaboration between the higher education department and the health department. Almost 40 lakh students studying in various colleges in the state will be benefited from this. However, some of these students may already be vaccinated. Hence, we will get an exact figure by tonight. I appeal to all students to make use of this and get vaccinated,” Samant added. Dhanraj Mane, director of higher education, said, "Since vacations are going on in many colleges, many students are still at their home town, which may be far from the college they have enrolled in. Hence, we have given the students a provision to register at a college centre near to them and get themselves vaccinated after showing their college ID cards. Instructions have also been given to the joint directors stating the for this.” Samant has been interacting with students from colleges and he said he plans to do so in about 50 colleges in the state. “We knew that due to Diwali, students may want to continue online till the festival ends and then go for online education. These 10-15 days will be beneficial for colleges and universities as they will get time to sanitise the area and make necessary preparations,” the minister added. Samant said that the mindset of students needs to change from online to offline exams now and for that offline classes must start. “We are trying to see where we can hold offline examinations. However, we had given universities the choice to conduct examinations either in offline mode or online mode depending upon the circumstances. Whatever the decision, care will be taken to ensure that students are not affected adversely in any case,” Samant said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/vaccine-drive-in-5000-colleges-offline-exams-likely-next-sem/articleshow/87213476.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi: Phase-II of Chandni Chowk’s revamp runs into funding wall||NEW DELHI: There seems to be another hindrance in the implementation of Delhi government’s plans to redevelop Chandni Chowk into a tourist hub. On Friday, the Public Works Department said that Phase II of the heritage stretch’s redevelopment during which the facades of buildings and other infrastructure were to be revamped has been delayed due to lack of funds. After the completion of Phase I of the project, under which the market area of Chandni Chowk got a facelift, PWD was scheduled to begin the work for the second phase in December. “In Phase II, for which work was to begin from December, all buildings on the 1.4-km Chandni Chowk stretch were to get a facade uplift. But like a few other PWD projects stalled for lack of funds, this project too has been hobbled by financial constraints,” disclosed a PWD official on Friday. In Phase 2, apart from the restoration of facades of the aged buildings on the boulevard, the internal lanes in the areas like Ballimaran, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road, Netaji Subhash Road and the precincts of Jama Masjid were to be restored. The PWD officials blamed Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, for the delay in the sanction of funds. TOI has a document from the October 8 meeting of the board of directors of SRDC, which also saw the participation of PWD officials, in which a resolution affirms, “SRDC shall fund and monitor execution of improvements of inner streets, façade restoration of buildings in Chandni Chowk and redevelopment of Jama Masjid precinct.” SRDC officials, including managing director Garima Gupta and the deputy general manager (project and administration), were contacted several times for their response, but they remained available for comment. The project aims to restore the heritage areas of Delhi and revive the Mughal aesthetics of these locations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/phase-ii-of-chandni-chowks-revamp-runs-into-funding-wall/articleshow/87214208.cms||Zumbish

---||Nagpur||Mihan to generate 1L jobs in next 2-3 years: Gadkari||Nagpur: Mihan project is taking wings and would employ about one lakh youths in the next two to three years, said Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday, adding the project would require additional land in the coming years. Speaking at a function to ink a pact between JNPT (Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust) and NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) for developing a multi-modal logistics hub (MMCL) at Sindi dry port in Wardha district, the city MP said already over 56,000 people have been employed with various companies in the mega project and he has all the details about them. “Information technology major Infosys is expanding and recruiting about 25,000-30,000 youths, another 5,000 would be employed by HCL. The TAL Manufacturing Solutions (TAL), a fully owned subsidiary of Tata Advanced Systems Limited, would be making drones apart from parts for Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Big godowns and railway siding are already in place there,” he said. Gadkari further said Mihan is fast developing into an aviation hub with the Dassault-Reliance plant already manufacturing parts for Rafale fighter jet, and various Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) depots repairing planes here. “We are promoting gold and diamond ornament manufacturers to set up their units here, as they would be able to export their products directly from Mihan. We have provided a plot to their association. Even pharmaceutical companies like Lupin are already operating here,” said the minister. Informing about major industries investing in the city, the BJP heavyweight said automobile major Maruti Suzuki has set up a depot near Butibori for distribution of their vehicles across the country. “Geographically Nagpur and Wardha being located in the heart of the country, companies like Maruti Suzuki have realised their importance. With the introduction of GST, it has become much easier for the companies to set up their units here. With the state government taking efforts, more export-oriented units could be set up here,” he added. Reiterating his stand on the use of ethanol-based fuel, Gadkari said government of India is promoting alternative fuels in a big way. “We have set up India’s first LNG pump in Nagpur and also converted a truck into LNG-run vehicle, which cost Rs10 lakh. We are expediting the Yavatmal-Nagpur-Nanded railway line and laying four-lane roads from Nagpur to Gondia. With the facilities at Wardha and Nagpur, the entire area would become a big industrial cluster having direct connectivity to Mumbai through Samruddhi Mahamarg,” said Gadkari. Terming both facilities at Nagpur and Wardha as the golden opportunity for entrepreneurs from the region to invest, the Union minister said some big industrialist would invest here and reap the profits if the locals did not tap the opportunity. “Unless we take initiative, we would continue to complain about Vidarbha’s backwardness. This is a good opportunity for export-oriented units from where fruits, vegetables and oranges could be exported. There is a huge potential. Our priority is to provide jobs to the farmers’ sons and daughters,” he said. ‘New Nagpur-Hyderabad Expressway soon’ Nitin Gadkari also announced a new Nagpur-Hyderabad Expressway during the event. He said the connectivity of the new road would be brought to Sindi dry port. “With this, those from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana could use the logistics facilities at Sindi for exporting their products. They can also move their products to Mumbai through Samruddhi Mahamarg from this dry port,” he said. In February last year, the government of Telangana had submitted a proposal for setting up of Hyderabad–Warangal and Hyderabad–Nagpur industrial corridors, which was considered by the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT). In a reply to a query in Rajya Sabha, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had informed that a meeting was held in January 2020 between the officials of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (DMICDC) and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd (TSIIC) to study feasibility of these projects. “It was decided that TSIIC would submit a revised proposal in accordance with the institutional and financial structure as approved by the government of India for development of industrial corridors,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mihan-to-generate-1l-jobs-in-next-2-3-years-gadkari/articleshow/87213426.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||University of Hyderabad launches course to teach Sanskrit using computer tools||HYDERABAD: University of Hyderabad (UoH) has launched an online inter-disciplinary programme ‘Samsaadhanii Praveshika’ to teach Sanskrit with the help of computer tools. The new course was launched as part of UoH’s institution of eminence status. Research undertaken by the students during the last 15 years has resulted in a computational platform that hosts several computational tools for accessing and understanding Sanskrit texts. The Sanskrit department collaborated with computer scientist-turned-computational linguist professor Gérard Huet from Inria, a research institute in France. The collaboration between the two groups resulted in a joint system that can analyse any Sanskrit text. In this course, the traditional methods of teaching are combined with the modern technology without compromising the ‘understanding’ of Sanskrit texts. “This course would be a trendsetter to understand how language analysis, rigour of computation and scientific methods can be utilised for understanding thoughts as well as also understanding the construction of ideas through languages,” said professor BJ Rao, UoH vice-chancellor. This course will be taught by a team of four: Arjuna from Manipal University, Pavankumar Satuluri from Chinmaya Vishwasvidyalaya, Kochi, professor Huet and professor Amba Kulkarni of UoH. A total of 250 candidates have registered from abroad, India and from UoH. The candidates have varied backgrounds from arts and humanities to engineering and medicine and their age ranges from 20 to 80, geographically from Fiji to California covering the whole world.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/uoh-launches-course-to-teach-sanskrit-using-computer-tools/articleshow/87214215.cms||---

According to Jal Sansthan officials, water supply was stopped late on Thursday evening and restored on Friday evening.  However, residents of several sectors of Mahanagar and some parts of Indiranagar complained that sudden disruption in water supply caused massive inconvenience. “Our household chores were stopped due to no water supply in our locality. We had to rely on a handpump to store water for drinking. The complaint number of Jal Sansthan was not reachable, so we weren’t able to lodge a complaint, “ said Jai Rawat of sector 16 Indiranagar. A similar situation was found in sector B of Mahanagar Extension. Shrutika Agnihotri said, “We require water to fulfil our daily needs. Our utensils have not been cleaned since last night. We have purchased a 10-litre water bottle to drink and cook.” Residents of areas where water supply was restored after more than 12 hours were complaining of low water pressure. Ajeet Dubey of sector 12 Indiranagar said, “It is taking about an hour just to fill a bucket. We did not receive water for more than 12 hours. So, as supply got restored, all my family members decided to store water in some big utensils, however it’s taking very long. We are afraid that water supply will stop once again.” Jal Sansthan secretary Ram Kailash said, “The supply was halted for some hours due to pipeline repair work. We have already restored it; zonal officials have been asked to recheck for water supply in their respective areas.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/water-crisis-in-indiranagar-mahanagar/articleshow/87214863.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Three experts of Goa coastal body disassociate themselves from Vainguinim beach wall order||PANAJI: After Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) withdrew its show cause notice to a starred hotel over the Vainguinim beach wall issue, one expert member of the authority has objected to the decision. Two other expert members of GCZMA, of the total four members, have chosen to distance themselves from the decision related to the Vainguinim beach wall. GCZMA expert member Flaviano Jose Miranda has written to GCZMA stating that the beach wall is already causing erosion and environmental damage to Vainguinim beach. Miranda has said that the authority must direct demolition of the linear wall and order restoration of the affected beach stretch. “The linear wall as constructed is acting like a seawall. In my opinion, it is bound to alter hydrodynamic conditions on interaction with predominant waves and cause scouring at the down-drift end.  The impact is visible on site with massive erosion along the respondent’s property along the eastern side during Cyclone Tauktae and the current monsoon season. Erosion of the beach on the eastern side can be expected in future,” Miranda has told GCZMA. Members Sujeetkumar Dongre and Savio Correia have also written to GCZMA stating that they were not present when the final arguments in the Vainguinim beach wall matter were being heard, and therefore they should not be associated with the order of GCZMA. The GCZMA proceedings against the hotel were initiated after the Vainguinim Valley Residents’ Association (VVRA) and other individual residents had complained that the starred hotel had illegally constructed a wall on the public beach at Vainguinim. The residents’ allegation is that the hotel is trying to usurp the beach. But the hotel has maintained that they have only carried out repairs to an anti-sand erosion structure on the beach. After multiple hearings and inspections, GCZMA recently decided to withdraw its show cause notice issued to the hotel. The GCZMA order stated that the changes made to the wall were as approved by the authorities. Meanwhile, VVRA has said that the GCZMA order is appalling when three of the four experts do not agree with the authority’s order. “One expert member has filed a written objection clearly stating the facts of the matter and has asked for the wall to be demolished to save the environment. The GCZMA must consider the opinion, findings and recommendations of the experts,” the VVRA has said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/three-experts-of-goa-coastal-body-disassociate-themselves-from-vainguinim-beach-wall-order/articleshow/87214236.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Like in the previous weeks, there was heavy police deployment with the cops positioning themselves between the prayer gathering and the protesters to prevent an escalation. An argument broke out when they prevented the protesters from approaching the congregation. Later, supported by the protesters, Kamlesh Saini, a resident of Rajiv Nagar (Sector 13), submitted a police complaint, alleging those who offer namaz at the site are not locals and police should check their identity cards. ACP (Old City) Ashok Kumar said the complaint had been sent to the administration. Kulbhushan Bharadwaj, a former BJP Gurgaon district president who led the protests, said some residents were not happy with namaz being held in open areas. “We will protest again in different parts of the city,” he added. Altaf Ahamad, member of the Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch that had earlier petitioned the administration to act against attempts to disrupt namaz, said the protesters went very close to the Sector 12 prayer site and shouted slogans while prayers were on. “Their real issue is not namaz in the open. They intend to create hatred in society,” he alleged. He added that people gathered in open areas for namaz in various parts of the city because of convenience. “They usually assemble in small groups, offer prayers and then go back to work. Many organisations also assign places for Friday prayers. It takes just 15-20 minutes,” Ahmad said, adding that it is not convenient during working hours to travel 2-4 km to offer namaz and then return. Namaz was, meanwhile, offered peacefully and without any disruption this Friday in Sector 47, said ACP (Sadar) Aman Yadav. The protests in the area had been called off earlier this week after the local RWA head met the Gurgaon deputy commissioner. The city had first seen protests and opposition to namaz in open areas in 2018. At the time, namaz used to be offered at 106 places in the open. After the protests, the administration held a series of meetings with people from both communities and designated 37 sites for namaz to be offered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/namaz-protest-called-off-at-one-site-staged-at-another/articleshow/87214244.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Hyderabad||NHRC staff threatened me, signed statement without reading it: ACP||HYDERABAD: On the second day of his deposition before the SC-appointed panel inquiring into the alleged encounter of four accused in Disha rape and murder, ACP V Surender claimed that NHRC team threatened him while recording his statement and he signed without reading it. The incident happened in the presence of NHRC DIG Manzil Saini and he had reported it to Shamshabad DCP, the ACP said. Surender, then ACP of Shadnagar and investigating officer (IO) of Disha rape and murder case, had taken the four accused to agricultural fields in Chattanpally for recovery of articles on December 6, 2019, when the alleged encounter happened. While admitting that his statement running into 15 pages was signed by him, the ACP said he was not sure what finally went in it as there was an argument with NHRC officials over contradiction between what he had stated and what they had recorded. “It was late in the night. They had also threatened that if they write a report, I will be suspended. DIG madam was also present. My mental state was not well. It was late hours. Because of their threatening, I could not do anything and I signed,” the ACP, who has 28 years in the service, told the commission. The incident was reported to Shamshabad DCP N Prakash Reddy who “simply listened”, the ACP said, adding that he decided not to pursue it further. Regarding the confessional statements of the four accused, ACP Surender stated that it was recorded at the safe house by panch witnesses with the help of a scribe on the intervening night of December 5-6, 2019. But the commission’s advocate questioned the ACP’s claims by pointing at his case diary, his affidavit before the commission and also his statement recorded by the IO of the alleged encounter case, J Surender Reddy, where it was mentioned that the confessions were recorded by him. The ACP said that he did not make any such statement before J Surender Reddy and also claimed that there was no mistake in the case diary either. He said that the mistake occurred in the affidavit due to gap between his instructions and preparation of document by the advocate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/nhrc-staff-threatened-me-signedstatement-without-reading-it-acp/articleshow/87214224.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Pune||Woman wanted in Rs15L investment fraud arrested from Rajkot||Pune: The Pune cyber police have arrested Surat resident Neha Prakashbhai Mehta (30) from Rajkot in an alleged Rs15lakh investment cheating case registered by a Warje resident. The police took Mehta’s custody from their counterparts in Rajkot and brought her to Pune on Wednesday. The police have already secured custody of her brother Vikas (29) in the case on October 14 after he was arrested by the Surat police in a similar case there. Apart from Neha and Vikas, police have arrested three bank account holders from Mumbai and Gujarat and a call centre executive from Surat. “The brother-sister duo is the prime suspect in the case, and they are suspected to have cheated many others,” said D S Hake, senior police inspector, cybercrime police. Police said the brother and sister are accused of having cheated a Warje-based man to the tune of Rs15lakh in April by promising handsome returns on investment in the share market. The victim lodged a complaint with the cybercrime police in August. Hake said, “The brother and sister used to run a call centre in Oshiwara, Mumbai. The two had secured data of people involved in share trading from data centres in Delhi and Noida. The call centre executives used to call people mentioned in the data and requested them to invest in shares via their company.” “The complainant received the call and the executive asked him to invest money in shares via the platform provided by Mehtas. The victim then transferred Rs15lakh to their account. After receiving money, the suspects blocked the victim’s phone number,” Hake said. “Before shifting to Mumbai, the duo used to run a call centre at Surat. This call centre was raided by the Surat police in 2020, and they shifted their base to Mumbai,” Hake said. “Apart from the Mehtas, police arrested bank account holders Shahid Umar Bhagad (49) and Mohammed Shakir Ibrahim Shaikh (23), both residents of Mumbai. Police also arrested call centre executives, Aamir Aarif Aghadi (26) and Badal Kadiya (21), both residents of Surat. All the four have been released on bail,” Hake said. Police are searching for five more suspects. “The Surat police have registered a Rs9lakh cheating case against Vikas, while Rajkot police have registered another cheating case to the tune of Rs70lakh against Neha,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/woman-wanted-in-rs15l-investment-fraud-arrested-from-rajkot/articleshow/87192543.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Parents seek reopening of ‘after school care centres’||While schools will be reopened for students of Class I-VIII from November 1, the demand to reopen ‘after school care centres’ is gaining traction to facilitate working parents. These centres take care of children after school hours until their parents return from work. Unlike students of Class IX-XII who can manage on their own, Class I-VIII students need to be taken care of after school hours, especially in cases where both the parents go to work and return late in the evening. Many of the day care centres were operating as ‘after school care centres’ pre-Covid as it fetched them additional income. Exclusive facilities were also operating as ‘after school care centres’ in the city. Private schools are expecting the state government to give permission for ‘after school care centres’ to operate. “It will be like sending their children to tuition centres as it was before the pandemic. Now that the cases have come down and the majority population is vaccinated, we expect the government to give permission,” S Ananthi, a parent from Ganapathy, said. These centres may help families which don't have elders at home and both parents go to work, she said. “It is safe for children of lower classes to reach back home after school hours. Long hours away from home is not advisable,” a senior official from the school education department said. Reopening of schools is to ensure that the children get back to school atmosphere which will psychologically help them in their learning. The government is taking a calculated risk and it may not want to add to the risk factor, the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/parents-seek-reopening-of-after-school-care-centres/articleshow/87214226.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Unpredictable weather a big threat to trekking, feel experts||Kolkata: Climate change has left adventure sports like trekking far more hazardous than before. The Uttarakhand trekking mishap is a grim reminder of how things can turn disastrous even after adopting every precaution. According to adventure sports specialists, it is now extremely difficult to predict a safe route in the Himalayan region for trekking at a particular time of the year. “You can never predict a flash flood and if it happens, it would be very difficult to negotiate it,” they said. “No amount of experience will be of use in the face of nature’s fury. Trekkers need to have a much greater risk assessment before embarking on a trip now,” said Basanta Singha Roy, a master trekker. Uttarakhand has recorded a whopping 192.6mm rain this month so far against a normal of 31.2mm. Of this, 122.4mm was recorded in 24 hours. Reportedly, around 52 people lost their lives. The worst affected district was Nainital. This untimely downpour has largely been attributed to the extended stay of the southwest monsoon over the country. The presence of monsoon current over the region means the presence of abundance of moisture over the landmass, keeping weather conditions favourable for the formation of the weather systems, said climatologists. G P Sharma, president (meteorology and climate change) of Skymet Weather, said: “Had the monsoon departed on time, we would not have seen such torrential rains. Weather conditions were very favourable for such heavy precipitation on account of multiple weather systems coming together. While there was a western disturbance up in the hills, two low pressure areas were seen over Madhya Pradesh and the Bay of Bengal. However, what prompted these systems was the delayed withdrawal of monsoon.” “We never faced such nature’s fury even five-10 years ago. But now, any trekking involves a higher degree of risk as you don’t know what is in store. Despite taking all SOPs of trekking, we have been losing our fellow climbers to nature’s revenge,” said Manas Sarkar, another seasoned trekker. June to October is the peak season for trekking in the Himalayas. After October, it becomes impossible to trek because of snowfall. “For the last few years, the trekking period has been constantly shifting because of the prevailing weather systems. Many are avoiding August-September because of the rain. But who could predict such rain in October?” Sarkar wondered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/unpredictable-weather-a-big-threat-to-trekking-feel-experts/articleshow/87213486.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The CBRE report `The next normal – Reimagining Hyderabad’s real estate landscape’ pointed out that the growth of Hyderabad’s investment grade office stock has been fueled by the rising demand and supply of office space, especially in the IT and extended IT corridor, thanks to factors such as extensive government policies, efficient urban infrastructure, and availability of skilled workforce. According to the report, future demand for office space would be driven by key tenant sectors such as IT & ITeS, BFSI, research, consulting and analytics, life sciences, engineering and manufacturing, and emerging segments such as flexible workspaces and e-commerce.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-office-stock-crosses-90m-sq-ft/articleshow/87214237.cms||---

Rao is also the chairperson of Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (PUMTA). With the work likely to commence post-Diwali, a meeting, chaired by Rao, will be held next week to sketch out a plan of action, Pawar said. He said preliminary discussions have been held with all stakeholders considering that several roads passing through Aundh, Baner, Senapati Bapat Road, Range Hills, Harekrishna Road and Pashan converge at the university chowk. Pawar said a detailed traffic management system will have to be planned along with the traffic and police departments to cause minimum chaos at the university chowk. He said that PUMTA will have representatives from the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), police and traffic departments, defence, the Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management and the railways who will provide inputs and suggestions on the phase-wise construction of the double-deck flyover. Pawar further said that during the pandemic last year, the old flyover, constructed in 2006, was demolished to cause minimum traffic jams. The new plan envisages a double-deck flyover on the lines of the Nagpur Metro and the entire plan has been readied by IIT-Mumbai and Systra, a multinational engineering and construction group. The plan was approved by elected representatives and the funding will be provided by the state government, said Pawar. The double-deck flyover is estimated to cost around Rs270crore. He said the construction work will commence once concessionaire, Tata -Siemens, gives a go-ahead. The project will be inaugurated by the chief minister, he said. PMRDA commissioner Suhas Diwase told TOI that the project is likely to commence after Diwali, while work at most places along the stretch is already underway. The project needs to be completed within three years and four months from the commencement date. Some preliminary work is already underway, including barricading work of around 3km and foundation work of pillars inside the barricading.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/meeting-to-decide-traffic-flow-plan-for-flyover-work/articleshow/87213484.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chandigarh||Between Beniwals: No treating rumours||ELLENABAD: Almost a week before the end of high-octane political campaign for Ellenabad assembly constituency, senior Congressman Bharat Singh Beniwal’s absence due to medical issues has triggered a debate here. While Beniwal has undergone a minor surgery at a private hospital in Mohali, the people in segment are talking about the timings of surgery connecting it with Beniwal’s resentment against the denial of ticket. His bete noire Pawan Beniwal, who had joined the Congress, was given the party ticket instead. However, talking to TOI, Bharat said he had a feeling of heaviness in his chest after which he was taken to Mohali. “As I had a small tumour near my ear, I was operated upon by the doctors there,” he added. When asked about the timings, he claimed that it was pending for a long time. “I may be discharged from the hospital on Saturday and thereafter I will hold a meeting with my supporters to convince them to vote in favour of the party candidate,” he added. The absence of Bharat at such a crucial juncture of the poll campaign, when the voting is slated for October 30, has given ammunition to the rival parties. Their workers have been spreading the words that Bharat is unhappy with the party high command over Pawan’s nomination. To play down the issue, state Congress president Selja tweeted Bharat Singh Beniwal’s picture from the hospital wishing him fast recovery. Bharat is the main face of the party locally and had managed to secure around 35,000 votes in the 2019 assembly polls. He, however, was unhappy over the induction of Pawan, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 assembly polls against him on BJP ticket, into the Congress. While Bharat is said to belong to Bhupinder Singh Hooda camp, Pawan is considered close to Selja. Although, both Bharat and Pawan are from the same village Darba in Ellenabad constituency, but they are considered arch rivals. However, on October 16, Bharat, had joined the Congress polls campaign for Pawan on Selja’s insistence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/former-cong-nominee-hospitalised-debate-rages/articleshow/87214238.cms||Ajay Sura

A cake was cut at the dispensary in Sector-12/A on the occasion. Two Panchkula villages, Khoi Bhagarni and Dhakhrog have achieved 100% vaccination in the district. Congratulating chief medical officer Dr Mukta Kumar and her team for achieving the target of 100% vaccinations in Khoi Bhagarni and Dhakhrog villages, Gupta said it was the result of efforts made by the Centre and state as well as doctors with medical and paramedical staff in the country. He noted that even developed countries with a robust health infrastructure had not been able to achieve this target. Even the US, he said, was still battling Covid-19 while India had managed to check the spread of the disease besides achieving the landmark of over 100 crore Covid-19 vaccine coverage. Gupta also commended Panchkula for making good progress under the drive with about 7.20 lakh doses administered in the district. Out of this, 4.50 lakh people have been given the first dose while 2.70 lakh have been administerd the second and vaccination is still in progress, he added. On vaccination coverage in the villages of Khoi Bhagarni and Dhakhrog, the speaker directed the CMO to celebrate the achievement with village residents by distributing sweets among them. He said villages who achieve the status of 100% vaccination would be encouraged. On the problems being faced by because of dengue in the civil hospital, Gupta said adequate arrangements have been made to check the spread. He also assured that sufficient beds were available for dengue patients in the civil hospital. He added that the number of dengue patients in Panchkula was much less than that in Chandigarh and Mohali. He said the MC is conducting fogging twice or thrice in all sectors. He said that the MC has arranged 11 new fogging machines for this purpose. He said that intensive fogging was being done in slums and villages and MC had been instructed to spray medicines wherever there was a problem of waterlogging.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/speaker-celebrates-vaccine-coverage-with-health-staff/articleshow/87213483.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||2 cops knock Telangana HC door to change witness category||HYDERABAD: In a twist in the hearing into the alleged Disha encounter, two police officers — cited as witnesses before the Justice Sirpurkar commission of inquiry (CoI) probing the killing of the four suspects — approached the Telangana high court on Friday with two separate pleas for urgent hearing. Their grouse was that they were initially called as state witnesses, but now converted as witnesses for the CoI. They wanted the HC to direct the commission to treat them as independent witnesses instead. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan said the petitions would be heard on Monday. The counsel for the two cops also made an effort to get the pleas heard by two single judges, but they expressed doubts on jurisdiction and referred the matter to CJ. An attempt to get it heard through a house motion too was rejected by the HC. While one plea was by CID DSP Vasam Surender, who was then the investigating officer (IO) of the Disha rape and murder case and took the four accused for recovery to the site on December 6, the day of the alleged encounter. The other plea was from Medchal inspector Konda Narasimha Reddy whose weapon was allegedly snatched by accused Md Arif on December 6, leading to the firing which eventually killed the four accused. The two petitions revolved around the same grievance that their plea to convert them as independent witnesses was rejected by the judges of the CoI. “We are called as witnesses under section 8-B of the CoI Act. Under this section our statements should be recorded at the end, after depositions of all witnesses,” the cops said in their pleas, citing the Supreme Court verdict in Kiran Bedi versus CoI case. They also expressed apprehension as the section dealt with those who may be prejudicially affected later. The Disha CoI was appointed by the Supreme Court and it has been conducting its inquiry partly from its office situated within the HC premises and partly through virtual mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/2-cops-knock-hc-door-to-change-witness-category/articleshow/87214246.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

CEO Dr Raju was accompanied by joint CEO, Punjab Inderpal, deputy commissioner (DC) Isha Kalia and additional DC (G) Komal Mittal. He asked master trainers of EVMs and VVPATs to get in-depth knowledge about the functioning of these machines and impart it to others so that the election process could be completed smoothly. He enquired about the functioning of the apparatus from master trainers. Acknowledging the crucial role of the staff, he described them as the pillar of democracy. According to the chief electoral officer, the Election Commission of India started first-level checking of EVMs and VVPATs well before elections so that the process could be completed as early as possible. First level checking (FLC) of EVMs and VVPATs was done to ensure seamless functioning of these units during voting, he said. DC Kalia said that a total of 1,284 control units, 1,769 ballot units and 1,383 VVPATs were available with the district and first level checking of the apparatus concluded a day before in the presence of representatives of political parties.

Schools are advising the parents to limit children's exposure to outside so that there are no health concerns during the exams. CBSE has already issued guidelines for classes X and XII term 1 exams that are scheduled to start from the end of November. Schools are preparing to conduct on-campus exams keeping in mind that the pandemic is not yet over and the festive season is on in Bengal. Many school authorities — and even a section of students and guardians — feel that offline exams are always a better choice but there are some reasons to worry. Firstly, the festive season is not over yet. Secondly, it has not been declared when the vaccination drive will start for children and thirdly, the government has not yet issued any directive regarding reopening of schools. “There is no government directive yet. So, at this stage, is it possible to conduct offline exams when the school is completely shut down?” wondered an official of a school. Another official said: “Who will control whom? If we ask parents to stop their children from roaming outside during the festive time, it is tough to monitor. We are following the guideline that has been given by the board.” Saltlake Siksha Niketan academic director Rekha Baishya said: “This is too early to issue any notice regarding exams, so we have decided to circulate guidelines for examinees.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cbse-schools-issue-health-advisory-ahead-of-exams/articleshow/87213489.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray to decide fate of Param Bir, departmental enquiry likely||MUMBAI: A week after additional chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty submitted an adverse report against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, now chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will decide his fate. Chakrabarty is believed to have recommended a departmental enquiry (DE) against Singh. Chakrabarty confirmed that he has submitted the preliminary enquiry (PE) report. “Home department is now the custodian...the PE was limited only to fact-finding and it was limited to the specific terms of reference given by the home department. About DE regarding all India service officers, IAS and IPS, recommendations are made by their cadre controlling authorities,” Chakrabarty said in a text message. While Chakrabarty did not comment on the findings in his report, according to sources, he has cited serious lapses and impropriety by Singh in discharging his duties as a police chief and in writing a letter directly to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray against the then home minister Anil Deshmukh. There were a few issues before Chakrabarty: firstly, reinstatement of dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze; secondly, whether Singh's letter violated discipline and conduct rules; and whether key information regarding placing an explosive outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani was suppressed from the then home minister and the CM. Initially, the home department had proposed that the PE be conducted by DGP Sanjay Pandey, but he declined, following which it was entrusted to Chakrabarty, a seasoned bureaucrat. Pandey had even recommended suspension of Singh, along with 24 other police officials for their alleged involvement in extortion cases. However, home minister Dilip Walse Patil asked the DGP to re-submit the file, along with more details and that each file should be submitted separately. In the event, if the CM approves a proposal for a DE, then an official of the rank of DG or an independent inquiry officer will have to be appointed to probe charges against him. Ever since the Chandiwal commission issued its first summons to Singh, he has failed to appear before the commission and the bailable warrant issued in his name too could not be served as he was not traceable. Now, the state CID and Thane Police have issued a lookout circular for tracing the controversial IPS official, who is due for retirement in June 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-chief-minister-to-decide-fate-of-param-bir-dept-enquiry-likely/articleshow/87214248.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Rajendra Mokashi, senior inspector, Koregaon park police, told TOI, “We arrested the two officials after they presented themselves before the investigation officer for questioning.” Mohite said, “The duo used to get in touch with officials of different hotels and asked them to share information about upcoming marriage events, claiming that they were competent authority to issue licences under the Copyright Act. On getting information they used to contact the parties holding marriage events and collected money in the name of issuing licences.” “The fraud came to light after the firm, through the duo, issued certificates to two businessmen authorising them to hold birthday party, DJ and get-together under the Copyright Act.

The move aims at achieving 100% vaccination coverage of the eligible population within the civic area.To avail of the service, office-bearer of such housing societies just need to submit an application to the ward medical officer of the PMC within the jurisdiction of which the housing society falls. The office-bearers can either mail the application or physically submit it to the ward office. Ward offices’ email IDs and phone numbers are available on the PMC website. “We have chalked up the housing society vaccination plan after Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol announced the initiative two days ago. However, we need at least 50 residents on the housing society premises to extend the benefit due to logistics involved,” said PMC’s chief immunization officer Suryakant Devkar. The PMC health department has also intensified the use of mass media tools to vaccinate approximately 2 lakh people in the municipal limits. “Initially, the Centre had pegged the eligible (18+) population in the city at 30 lakh. To be on the safer side, we consider there are 33 lakh eligible people residing within the PMC limits. Of them, we have vaccinated almost 31.53 lakh with one dose and 17.88 lakh have received both the doses of the vaccine. We are also making use of television, radio, newspapers and other tools to reach out to the unvaccinated,” Devkar said. PMC has a lot of floating population and migrant workers. “Despite all the odds, we want to ensure that everyone residing in the limit is immunised. It is a continuous process. It will take some time,” Devkar said. Health activist Sanjay Dabhade said, “Housing society office-bearers also need to act proactively and ensure that all of the residents on their premises are vaccinated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/free-vax-on-hsg-society-premises-with-riders/articleshow/87213490.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In order to eliminate the fear of pandemic among occupiers, developers are revamping their existing and upcoming buildings with technology enhancements, said a CBRE research report that was released during Hysea Infra Summit on Friday. Some of these technology enhancements include biometric facial recognition, touchless systems, smart security & visitor access control and smart elevator programming, among others. The report pointed out that developers are also taking steps such as renovating lobbies with more greenery, adding more shared event spaces and upgrading the hygiene standards of buildings to eliminate Covid fears. Developers are looking to improve indoor air quality by installing UV air filtration systems and upgrading air ventilation, enhancing landscaping to improve employee comfort and reduce anxiety in addition to adding health & wellness facilities and creating containment rooms with separate air circulation to isolate suspected staff, the report added. While addressing participants of the summit, Arvind Kumar, special chief secretary, MAUD, said that in current times, concepts such as ‘walk to work’ are set to gain traction. He said the government has come up with an integrated township policy wherein any developer having a site of over 100 acres beyond the ORR with plans to set up an integrated township, which has office space and residential space to enable walk to work convenience, will be offered numerous incentives. “There are two such developers and one of the sites is 480 acres that is coming up on the outskirts,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/developers-deploy-tech-to-make-offices-covid-safe/articleshow/87214242.cms||---

IICF secretary Athar Husain has sent a request to Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), seeking an amendment to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to accommodate Afghan Muslims seeking refuge in India. Referring to the recent beheading of a promising woman Afghan volleyball player, Mahjabin Hakimi, and hounding of female sports players by the Taliban, Husain in his tweet to PMO sought early action to save innocent women and children living in fear under the brutal regime. Talking to TOI, Husain said, “I appeal to the Union government to amend CAA to accommodate all victims of Taliban brutality in India, irrespective of their religious beliefs. The killing of a promising woman volleyball player, Mahajabi Hakimi, by Taliban is a cowardly act. Slaughtering a girl for her passion for sport is un-Islamic and a great sin under Shariya. The acts of Taliban are against Islam and the fatwa of 'kufr' must be declared against these barbarians.” Hakimi was one of the best players in the Kabul Municipality Volleyball Club and gruesome photos of her severed head were posted on social media while Talibs scoured houses for female sports players, her coach told news agencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/iicf-moves-pmo-seeks-amendment-to-caa-to-include-muslims-fleeing-taliban/articleshow/87214868.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The complainant, who is a retired senior medical practitioner, had initially reported the matter to the cyber police after the fraud occurred in April this year. Post-verification, the Shivajinagar police registered an FIR over his complaint on Thursday. The septuagenarian told TOI that after his heart surgery, he had started drinking red wine on a medicinal basis. “I was regularly buying the wine from a liquor shop located on Kelkar Road. On April 15, I searched that shop’s contact number on the internet and called,” the senior citizen shared. A person who claimed to be the manager took the order. “I was told the shop did not have a payment on delivery option. He asked me to transfer the money online. I told him that I would not share my credit/debit card details, so he gave me the option of payment via QR code. Believing it to be a safe mode, I transferred the Rs 1,470 bill amount,” the complainant said. He added, “After some time, a delivery person called me and said he was near my house. He also said I needed to complete the registration process, for which he sent me another QR code. After seeing Rs 19,991 mentioned as the amount, I became suspicious. He claimed I only needed to mention my actual bill amount. I scanned the QR code and the sum was siphoned off.” The deliveryman blamed a technical issue and sent yet another QR code. This time, Rs 97,250 was siphoned off. The senior citizen said, “The manager glibly explained some procedure to me, telling me to add an account number as beneficiary and transfer the same amount I had lost, which I would then get from the bank. I ended up losing Rs 3.16 lakh.” Inspector Vikram Gaud of the Shivajinagar police said, “The fraudsters were operating from different states. QR codes were sent through two cellphone numbers, registered in Assam and New Delhi. The amount was transferred to a private bank account in Indore (Madhya Pradesh) and Ambala (Haryana).”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/senior-citizen-seeking-wine-delivery-duped-of-rs-3-16-lakh/articleshow/87213498.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Kolkata||Jury ‘screens’ films at city cinema for India’s Oscar entry, verdict today||Kolkata: All eyes are set on Kolkata’s Bijoli cinema, where a panel of 15 judges has been watching 14 Indian films, from which one will be selected on Saturday. Filmmaking nations across the globe have been announcing the names of their respective entries to the Best International Feature Film for Oscars 2022. Bangladesh has already nominated Abdullah Mohammad Saad’s ‘Rehana Maryam Noor’. According to Firdausul Hasan, who is the vice-president of the Film Federation of India, there was a specific reason for choosing a single screen theatre in the city as the venue for screening. “Cinema is meant for the big screen, though the pandemic has come as a huge jolt. The single screen theatres, in particular, were badly impacted. We could have easily done the screenings at any auditorium in the city. But we made a conscious choice to host the five-day screenings at Bijoli to show our solidarity to the single screens,” he said. In 2019, the Oscar jury chaired by Aparna Sen also had the same venue, though it had shifted online in 2020. The return to Bijoli for screening has overwhelmed its owner, Suranjan Paul. “Survival of single-screen theatres is difficult during the pandemic. This theatre was built by my grandfather in 1935 and has been witness to some historic moments, including special shows of Satyajit Ray’s ‘Piku’ and ‘Sadgati’, the release of Ritwik Ghatak’s ‘Jukti Tokko Aar Goppo’ and Rituparno Ghosh’s ‘Unishe April’. The presence of the august jury members watching great films here is giving a right signal to the audience,” he said. Four jury members from Kolkata — music composer-turned-director Indraadip Dasgupta, editor Arghyakamal Mitra, actor Ananya Chatterjee, costume designer Ruma Sengupta — are in the panel chaired by Shaji N Karun. Among the 14 contenders are Pan Nalin’s ode to movie-going and movie-making, ‘Chhello Show’ (‘Last Film Show’), Shoojit Sircar’s historical drama, ‘Sardar Udham’, Madonne Ashwin’s Tamil poll satire, ‘Mandela’, Martin Prakkat’s political thriller, ‘Nayattu’ and Pushpendra Singh’s allegorical feminist fairy tale, ‘Laila Aur Satt Geet’. Others in contention include ‘Bridge’ (Assamese), ‘Sherni’ (Hindi), ‘Shershah’ (Hindi), ‘Kagaz’ (Hindi), ‘Aata Vel Zaali’ (Marathi), ‘Toofan’ (Hindi), ‘Godavari’ (Marathi), ‘Karkhanisanchi Waari’ (Marathi) and ‘Koozhangal’ (Tamil). The competition is tough but all the makers are hopeful. “My story is raw and my film reveals the true picture of rural India. There is an optimistic message too,” said ‘Bridge’ director Kripal Kalita about his first feature film. Among the contenders, ‘Laila Aur Satt Geet’ was the only one in competition at the Kolkata International Film Festival this year. From January 9 next year, Museum of Modern Art will open it in New York for a week. “My film deals with issues around migration, feminism within a marginalized community under a conflict zone. This makes the film more contemporary. Its release in the US and Museum of Modern Art will draw the attention further to the film. All this makes us really hopeful,” said the director.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/jury-screens-films-at-city-cinema-for-indias-oscar-entry-verdict-today/articleshow/87214268.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||PCB to launch pre-Diwali cracker crackdown||Kolkata: The Bengal government has marked 2020 as the cleanest and quietest Diwali and wants to go further in celebrating Kali Puja-Diwali as an environment-friendly festival this year. Every year, Diwali night pushes the city’s ambient air and noise pollution to such a level that the atmosphere doesn’t recover from the onslaught and winter pollution becomes dangerous for public health. The fear of the pandemic and greater enforcement of pollution rules led to the city scoring points by celebrating an unusual Diwali with the pollution remaining largely under control last year. “It was the awareness of citizens which brought this sweeping change. I make an appeal to all citizens to join the battle against pollution, which is a bigger killer than the pandemic itself,” said West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra.The pollution watchdog has been working in tandem with the city and state police to stop supply of crackers that violate the norms, and raids to bust illegal fireworks manufacturing units will soon be conducted, said a WBPCB officer. The watchdog has kept the ambient noise level below 90 decibels. Asked if any step was being taken to ensure that smoke from the fireworks do not harm patients with lung ailments, especially as we are still in the midst of the pandemic, he said, “We will go by the recommendations of the government. As of now, we will launch a crackdown on firecrackers exceeding the permissible sound threshold. We have to keep the health issue in mind, too.”WBPCB has distributed more than 2,000 unique GPS-fitted hand-held noise monitoring devices developed by Webel, which produce evidence of any noise surpassing the 90-decibel mark with latitude and longitude of the place of occurrence. “We have asked cops to get in touch with us if they have any issue with the devices. We can re-train personnel on its proper usage and calibrate them if required. We have an annual maintenance contract with Webel for them,” said a WBPCB officer.PCB will also seek monthly compliance reports from various police stations to ensure large-scale use of the devices. It will monitor its 79 ambient air quality monitoring (AAQM) stations and 16 continuous ambient air quality monitoring (CAAQM) stations too. “Since the CAAQM stations generate real-time air quality data, we can figure out if some heightened anthropogenic activities, like lighting firecrackers, are occurring,” said another officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pcb-to-launch-pre-diwali-cracker-crackdown/articleshow/87213516.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The commission, headed by retired high court judge J N Patel, passed an order to this effect under section 4 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, on an application filed by panel lawyer Ashish Satpute. The whereabouts of Singh, who is director-general of Maharashtra Home Guards, are currently not known; police are searching for him in relation to a bailable warrant to secure his presence before the Justice Chandiwal commission, which is looking into the allegations of corruption levelled by him against the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Shukla is currently the additional director-general of police with the Central Reserve Police Force in Hyderabad. “Singh was additional DGP (law and order) when the Koregaon Bhima violence occurred; Shukla was Pune police commissioner. The officers have intelligence inputs related to a series of events leading to the violence,” Satpute told TOI. The commission in its order observed that it deems it expedient to examine Singh and Shukla and for production of documents as prayed in the application.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||One more held for fund fraud||Thiruvananthapuram: One more corporation staff was arrested by police in connection with fund fraud in corporation zonal offices here on Thursday. Georgekutty, who was employed as corporation staff at Attipra zonal office, was held by Kazhakootam police reportedly from Rajaji Nagar on Thursday evening. The police are yet to record the arrest of Georgekutty and according to officials his arrest will be recorded on Friday. The police said that Georgekutty was absconding but they tracked his phone to Rajaji Nagar. He was suspended on September 29 for alleged fund fraud. Audit wing had found out that an amount of Rs 1.09 lakh was missing from the corporation account and it was collected on December 11,2020. The cashier was given a memo and it was found that Georgekutty failed to deposit the collection amount in the corporation’s account. The charge officer who was then employed at Attipra zonal office and later transferred to Kollam was recently placed under suspension by the director of urban affairs. The corporation had recommended to the urban affairs director that a show cause notice may be issued to her; however the director placed the official under suspension. Meanwhile, the members’ indefinite hunger strike went on for the second day while the UDF has also intensified the protests. The manner in which the protests have swelled beyond the control of the ruling council has been a setback for them. Protests against fund fraud have gathered momentum in the corporation council. A protest march by Youth congress workers turned slightly violent on Thursday. The council is being held on Friday when 35 BJP councillors are fasting in the council hall and it remains to be seen whether the mayor will seek police assistance in removing the councillors from the hall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/one-more-held-for-fund-fraud/articleshow/87192637.cms||---

A hunt is on for the fourth member of the gang. Two of the arrested men are criminals on police records out on bail in murder cases. Between October 15 and October 18, the gang approached four scrap dealers in and around Mahalunge on the pretext of scrap disposal deals and asked them to accompany them to various sites. Later, they kept the dealers confined at various spots and called their family members for money. “The gang succeeded in extorting money from three scrap dealers. But before they could extort money from their fourth target, our crime branch team nabbed them,” inspector Arvind Pawar of the Mahalunge police chowkey said. Assistant commissioner of police Prerana Katte told TOI, “All the gang members are from Talegaon Dabhade. Two of the suspects were in prison for murder. After their release on bail, the duo formed a gang and started targeting scrap dealers.” The arrested suspects have been identified as Sharad More (23), Sardar Sayyad (23) and Prabhu Koli. “More and one more suspect, who is on the run, are criminals on police records,” Pawar said. He said that on October 19, a 28-year-old scrap dealer filed a complaint that four men abducted him under the pretext of a scrap deal and extorted Rs1.5lakh from him. They took Rs1lakh in cash and Rs50,000 through online transaction. “Later, three more scrap dealers approached us. The suspects had extorted Rs 60,000 from one and Rs 10,000 from another. They had threatened the fourth dealer,” Pawar said. Modus operandiAfter release on bail, the suspect More and his accomplice took two men with them and formed a gang. “They decided to extort money from the scrap dealers by abducting them,” inspector Pawar said. They used to visit scrap dealers in a borrowed car. “They lured the dealers by offering a hands-on deal. They used to tell them to make cash arrangements and visited them after two days. They used to take the dealers with them in a car and extorted money by threatening them,” Pawar said. CCTV footage clueInspector Arvind Pawar of the Mhalunge police chowkey said that police swung into action after the suspects started targeting scrap dealers. “We collected CCTV footage from different spots. We identified the car used by them. The car belonged to their friend,” he said. “The crime branch nabbed three of the gang members early on Friday,” he said.

---||Madurai||HC: Sympathy can’t be ground for passing regularisation order||Madurai: Dismissing a plea moved by a woman part-time sweeper working in a government school who sought to regularise her service, the Madras high court reiterated that sympathy and sentiment cannot be grounds for passing any order of regularisation in the absence of any legal right. The petitioner P Sridevi was appointed as part-time sweeper in a government school at Nagercoil in Kanyakumari district in 1989. The state government had issued a GO in 2006, regularizing the services of the daily wage employees working in government departments who have rendered 10 years of service.The petitioner who had rendered more than 32 years of service had submitted representations seeking to regularise her service. Since her representation was not considered, she moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to regularise her service and sought time scale of pay and other benefits.Justice D Krishnakumar observed that based on the 2006 GO, the court had granted relief to several part-time employees who approached the court. Subsequently, the government reconsidered the matter and issued another GO in 2013 by revising the earlier GO. As per the 2013 GO, part-time and casual employees were not entitled for regularisation.The judge observed that when subsequently the state government preferred appeals against orders of the high court which had regularised the services of part-time employees, the Supreme Court had allowed the appeals in 2014.The Supreme Court had held that mere continuation of service by a temporary or daily wage employee, on the strength of some interim orders of the court, would not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into service, as such service would be ‘litigious employment’. The judge observed that following the SC judgement, the writ petitions seeking the relief sought under the 2006 GO was dismissed by this court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-sympathy-cant-be-ground-for-passing-regularisation-order/articleshow/87214265.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Chandigarh||Dalits start indefinite protest over social boycott||JIND: Tension escalated at Chhatar village of Jind district after a youth was allegedly thrashed by upper caste residents on Friday evening. The injured youth, identified as Vijay, was taken to Uchana Kalan hospital, from where he was referred to another medical facility. Earlier in the day, scheduled castes (SC) members of Chhatar village had started an indefinite protest in front of the mini secretariat here, demanding the arrest of 23 upper caste residents who have been booked for their social boycott. They even burnt an effigy of the Haryana government for not addressing their grievances. On September 11, SC member Gurmeet had lodged police complaint, accusing some upper caste youth of thrashing him and using a castiest slur against him while watching a kabaddi match. To settle the matter, a panchayat was called and Gurmeet asked to take back the police complaint. When he refused, some upper caste residents announced a social boycott on September 26, after holding a panchayat of around 150 families of their community. Uchana Kalan police have booked 23 residents of Chhatar village for the social boycott of SC community in the village. DSP Jitender Khatkar said, “We have ensured safety and security of SC community in village and also formed a peace committee in the village.” SC community activist Dinesh Kumar claimed that upper caste residents of two villages — Khapar and Chhatar — in Uchana Kalan segment are also facing social boycott for seeking police action in the matter, instead of letting the panchayat decide it. “We will continue the protest till all the accused are arrested,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/reviseddalits-start-indefinite-protest-over-social-boycott/articleshow/87214263.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Film buffs welcome Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement Award for Martin Scorsese, Istvan Szabo||KOLKATA: Cine buffs in the city have welcomed Union minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur’s announcement to confer the Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement Award on film-makers Istvan Szabo and Martin Scorsese at the 52nd International Film Festival of India (IFFI). According to the Ray family, this is a fitting tribute to the legend on his centenary year. Sandip Ray said, “I have been watching Szabo’s films for a long time. He has been a festival favourite and I loved his ‘Mephisto’. I am not sure if Szabo has watched my father’s films, but Scorsese has spoken about them on a number of occasions. Scorsese has been instrumental in restoring Baba’s films and was really keen that the honorary Oscar be bestowed on my father.” In world cinema, 78-year-old Scorsese and 83-year-old Szabo are two of the greatest and most influential film-makers representing the New Hollywood era and European auteurism respectively. Director Anik Dutta, who is shooting a film based on the making of ‘Pather Panchali’, said, “Scorsese was deeply inspired by Ray. One can even trace inspirations of Ray’s ‘Abhijan’ in Scorsese’s ‘Taxi Driver’.” Scorsese has been generous in his admiration of Ray’s cinema and how he loved the director’s way of presenting a nuanced perspective about Indian cinema to the global audience. He was mesmerized the day he watched all three films of the Apu Trilogy at one go in a Manhattan theatre. From Subrata Mitra’s close-ups of Apu’s eyes in ‘Pather Panchali’ to Pt Ravi Shankar’s score, everything took his breath away and left a permanent impression on him. Director Atanu Ghosh said that, in terms of film-making, Istvan Szabo and Martin Scorsese are very different. “Scorsese is a torch-bearer to Ray because he continued the tradition that Ray and other iconic directors of that generation initiated and propagated. Another interesting turn in the history of film-making came through a group represented by Szabo,” Ghosh said. Like Ray, the search for roots and identity, pangs of guilt, redemption and faith affected Scorsese. “Szabo has explored psychological complexity over and over. Films of both Szabo and Scorsese have repeatedly renewed their trust in humanism. Their subjects concerned common people and their surroundings. While Scorsese gained universal acclaim portraying the universality of taxi drivers across the world, tram cars and their passengers have played a dominant role in many of Szabo’s films,” Ghosh said. Film scholar Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay said, “Those like me who grew up with the film society movement in Kolkata in the 70s have a special interest in Szabo’s cinema. His ‘Mephisto’ remains a cult work and inspires our artistic conscience in times of crisis. Conferring an award on the maker of ‘You’ and ‘Budapest Tales’ is a very wise decision.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/film-buffs-welcome-ray-award-for-scorsese-szabo/articleshow/87213511.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

These establishments, shut after the second wave hit the state, have reopened just ahead of Diwali in line with the state government's policy to ease coronavirus-related curbs. Earlier, the state government had allowed reopening of religious places and schools for standards VII to XII. Nashik city has five multiplexes with a total 15 screens. Of these, one multiplex with five screens reopened on Friday, while two more facilities with five screens are expected to reopen in the next few days. “We started our multiplexes with five screens in accordance with government guidelines. We received very good response though we started with 50% capacity on the very first day of the show,” said an official from the multiplex, which has 10 screens at three locations. Nashik city resident Vijay Kurule said, “The last one-and-a-half years of Covid pandemic made us tired and we were waiting for the multiplexes to reopen. I enjoyed the first show of a movie at the multiplex.” Richa Kakkar, a movie buff, said, “Watching movies at multiplex is really exciting. We can’t get the same feeling while watching a movie online.” Apart from multiplexes, the auditoriums also opened today. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has three auditoriums, including one that is being renovated. “Kalidas Kala Mandir and Dadasaheb Gaikwad hall reopened from Friday. We have Saturday’s booking for Gaikwad and a programme at Kalidas on Monday,” an NMC official said. Single screen theatres have decided not to start operations and wait for a few weeks. Vinay Chumbhle, president of the Single Screen Theatre Owners’ Association, said, “Ww have decided to wait and watch as we are pursuing our demands with the state and central governments. One of the major demands is about allowing exit policy to single screen theatre owners so that they can decide whether to continue with the theatre or build a mall or shopping complex on the same premises. In Kolhaur, the Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruh resumed in Kolhapur after a gap of 11 months. The theatre artists had organized a special event called ‘Anandotsav’, on Friday evening to celebrate reopening of the auditoriums. The event, which included song and dance shows, was attended by Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil. While inaugurating the programme, Patil assured the artistes from the city that the rent of the Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruh would be further reduced by 50% to help the theatre fraternity tide over the pandemic-induced losses. Earlier, the administration had announced a 10% reduction in the rent amount. Mahesh Jadhav, a theatre and film make-up artist, said, “It was the need of the hour to open the theatres.” Single screen theatres were likely to open from next week. Suryakant Patil-Budhihalkar from cine-exhibitors association said, “As most of the theatre owners were not having any product with them, the single screen theatres did not reopen on Friday. The facilities will reopen next week.” Only the screens at Inox at Reliance Mall and PVR at DYP City Mall have started with a few shows and are allowing people who have received both the vaccines. Cinema halls and auditoriums also reopened in Aurangabad on Friday. Dashrath Khajindar, general manager of an organization heading three multiplexes in the city, told TOI, “The response was good on Day One and we had 40 shows at our three multiplexes. We are confident that the number of customers will increase and people will return to the halls to watch cinema. A manager with a leading multiplex said, “There were so many people happy to visit cinema halls after a long gap. We are confident about packed shows on weekends.” In some cases, the cinema halls had to call off some shows for want of an adequate audience. Of the 10 shows lined up for Day One at Amba and Apsara cinema halls, four had to be cancelled due to lack of response. Its manager, Alen Lazarus, said, “We are confident that the crowd will definitely return to the halls.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/multiplexes-theatres-reopen-amid-covid-safety-measures/articleshow/87213523.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Workshop for priests on Kali Puja rituals||KOLKATA: Priests from across the city and districts have assembled in Kolkata to get acquainted with the nuances of rituals and mantras needed for Kali Puja. While such workshops for priests before Durga Puja are common, this is the first time such a training session is being held before Kali Puja, which will be celebrated early next month. The workshop started at the Daw household in Jorasanko on Friday and will continue till Sunday. Fifty priests who will be performing rituals at different community Kali Pujas across the city are attending it. “The procedures and shlokas are different for all pujas. The procedures used during Durga Puja don’t apply while worshipping Kali. The workshop has been organised to sensitise the priests about the right rituals,” said Jayanta Kushary, principal of Sarba Bharatiya Prachya Academy, a school of oriental studies which is organising the three-day workshop. “It is very important to have a clear concept about the two festivals and the places where the two goddesses find mention,” said Kushary. Participating priests, some of whom have joined the profession recently, will also be given a crash course to brush up on their chanting skills. The number of Kali Pujas in the city has been rising, spiking demand for priests. “But they should know the shlokas and other rituals required. The puja is different from Durga Puja. Our objective is to impart correct knowledge of the verses and procedures,” said Kushary. The priests will also be sensitised about Covid-appropriate behaviour during the workshop. “Almost all priests attending the workshop have been vaccinated. During the festival, they will insist on people wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” Kushary said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/workshop-for-priests-on-kali-puja-rituals/articleshow/87213520.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Sources in the forest department said that the programme “is almost final.” During the dry runs, instead of regular passengers, forest department’s officials will travel on the routes proposed for the three circuits to get a first hand experience of infrastructure and facilities. The three ecotourism circuits for which the dry runs are proposed are Agra-Etawah, Gorakhpur-Sohagibarwa and Vindhyan circuit between Varanasi and Chandauli. A total of nine ecotourism circuits have been identified for development and promotion by the state government. Two circuits are comparatively developed, one of which includes Dudhwa tiger reserve and the other has Pilibit tiger reserve, but others need promotion as they mostly draw local tourists and have beautiful yet lesser known locales. The Gorakhpur-Sohagibarwa circuit will be a two-day tour starting from Gorakhpur zoo and ending at Sohagibarwa wildlife sanctuary, Maharajganj. A 70-hectare Pargapur taal, Vinodvan which is a mini forest, Budhiya Mata mandir in Gorakhpur, Darjinia taal (lake) and a 2-km nature trail in the dense forest in Sohagibarwa wildlife division in Maharajganj will be the attractions. In Varanasi-Chandauli circuit are the Rajdari-Devdari waterfalls on the Chandraprabha dam on the Chandraprabha river in the state’s oldest wildlife sanctuary, Chandraprabha wildlife sanctuary, which was declared in 1957, in Chandauli. The waterfalls are about 65km from Varanasi and are perennial. The site has quite a few facilities existing for tourists besides a forest rest house. The Agra-Etawah circuit will start from the Taj Nature Walk in Agra. It will have Sur Sarovar bird sanctuary (Keetham lake) in Agra and National Chambal Sanctuary that is internationally recognised for ghariyals and over 300 bird species in Agra and Etawah on the route and end at the lion safari in Etawah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/dry-runs-on-up-ecotourism-circuits-may-begin-on-oct-28/articleshow/87214871.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Goa||GMC vendors suspend stir after St Cruz MLA steps in||Panaji: Kiosk operators who have been agitating since Monday, suspended their protest after Santa Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes assured them that their kiosks will be set up at the earliest. About 37 kiosks operators and 16 fruit and vegetable vendors who operated along the road outside Goa Medical College, Bambolim were evicted in August for encroaching on public spaces, following an order of the court. While the government subsequently agreed to rehabilitate them, the kiosk operators were irked over the delays and staged a protest outside the MLA’s residence. “I met and explained to them that kiosks will be set up without a further delay. I had also raised the issue in the assembly,” Fernandes said. A majority of the operators were from his constituency and some from St Andre. When he raised the issue on the concluding day of the Goa legislative assembly on Tuesday, CM Pramod Sawant had assured the House they will rehabilitate them within a week, admitting that there had been a delay. The affected parties intensified the agitation about a week ago, coinciding with the two-day session of the Goa legislative assembly. Some protestors alleged that both BJP MLAs - Fernandes and Francis Silveira - had failed to help them. The government did start the process to rehabilitate them and a plan was drawn to set up kiosks in the limited space available. However, the plan was disturned as five operators who were allotted kiosks under the Deen Dayal scheme, moved the court and got an order in their favour wherein the court directed that kiosks be set up with a distance of 1.5 metres from each unit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gmc-vendors-suspend-stir-after-st-cruz-mla-steps-in/articleshow/87214280.cms||---

---||Madurai||Matchbox price hiked after 14 yrs, to cost Rs 2||Madurai: Representatives of five major matchbox industry bodies have unanimously resolved to increase the maximum retail price (MRP) of a matchbox from Rs 1 to Rs 2 with effect from December 1. The last time the price was revised was in 2007 from 50 paise to Rs 1.The decision was taken in the meeting organised by the All India Chamber of Matches at Sivakasi on Thursday. Industry representatives attributed the recent increase in raw material prices as the reason for increasing the price.Manufacturers said that 14 raw materials are needed for making a matchbox. The price of a kilogram of red phosphorus has climbed from Rs 425 to Rs 810, wax from Rs 58 to Rs 80, outer box board from Rs 36 to Rs 55 and inner box board from Rs 32 to Rs 58. Price of paper, splints, potassium chlorate and sulphur have also increased since October 10. Increasing diesel price has also burdened them further.Secretary of the national small matchbox manufacturers association V S Sethurathinam told TOI that manufacturers are selling a bundle of 600 matchboxes (with 50 matchsticks in each box) for Rs 270 to Rs 300. “We have decided to increase the selling price from our units by 60% to Rs 430-Rs 480 per bundle. This is excluding 12% GST and cost of transportation,” he said.However, the effective price at which it would reach the consumers would double. “We discussed fixing the MRP at Rs 1.5 a box. But it would lead to a lot of confusion as traders would have to search for 50 paise coins that are hardly in use now. There could be initial setbacks due to the price hike but people will get used to it as the matchbox is still among the least priced commodities they buy,” he added.Around four lakh people are directly (3 lakh) and indirectly (1 lakh) employed in the industry across the state and more than 90% of the direct employees are women. The industry hopes to attract a more stable workforce by paying them better as many are evincing interest in working under the MGNREGS and as farm hands during the rainy season, as they are much more remunerative. Matchbox makers are paid based on the basis of their ability to make boxes. Women are paid Rs 240 to Rs 280 a day and men around Rs 300 to Rs 350 a day.Nearly 120 industry representatives from the matchbox hub Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district, Sankarankovil and Thiruvengadam in Tenkasi district, Virudhunagar and Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district, Gudiyatham in Vellore district and Kaveripattinam in Krishnagiri district participated in the meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/matchbox-price-hiked-after-14-yrs-to-cost-rs-2/articleshow/87214276.cms||M K Ananth

But the continued withdrawal of 53 concessions given to almost 21.75 crore passengers, except in the case of railway employees, is affecting the common passenger. According to a comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report, only 11.45% of the reserved passengers avail concessions.All the concessions except railway passes were withdrawn in festival, holiday specials and clone trains by a commercial circular dated December 7, 2020. In a country where 20% of the population is below the poverty level, concessions are essential to ensure pilgrimage and tourism, he said. Withdrawal of concessions has only made passengers withdraw from travel even for necessity. Stressing on restoring all the concessions in all the special trains, he said that extension of season tickets including student concessions is utmost necessity as colleges and schools are reopening after the pandemic. He urged the minister to restore season tickets including free and concessional tickets to students and the market vendor tickets to rural merchants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mp-urges-rly-min-to-restore-concessions/articleshow/87214279.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Unable to appear due to health issues: Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh to probe panel||MUMBAI: The controversial former Mumbai police commissioner, Param Bir Singh, through a person holding power of attorney, has informed the Justice K U Chandiwal commission that it will not be possible for him to remain present owing to his limited mobility and health issues. The affidavit filed on behalf of Singh said he did not wish to cross-examine any person and lead further evidence before the commission, following which the proceedings were adjourned to October 28. It is expected that on October 28, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze will be examined. A man named Mahesh Panchal has submitted the affidavit on behalf of Singh and it has been affirmed in Chandigarh in August 2021. The affidavit states that whatever has to be conveyed was disclosed in Singh’s March 20 letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Supreme Court. It says that owing to limited mobility, health issues and a series of litigations, it will not be possible for him to remain present before the commission. Following Singh’s March 20 letter against the then home minister Anil Deshmukh, the state government had on May 11, set up a one-man commission presided over by Justice Chandiwal to probe into the charges levelled by Singh, who had alleged that Deshmukh had set a target of Rs 100 crore to be collected from restaurant and bar owners in the city. Despite summons being issued by the commission, Singh has never appeared before it. Subsequently, the commission had issued a bailable warrant against him. The state CID was entrusted with the responsibility to execute the warrant, but it was unable to do so. During the course of hearing, Singh’s lawyer had challenged the validity of the commission on the ground that issues raised before the commission had already been adju-dicated by the Bombay high court. However, the commission had rejected his contention.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-unable-to-appear-due-to-health-issues-singh-to-probe-panel/articleshow/87214285.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

These establishments, shut after the second wave hit the state, have reopened just ahead of Diwali in line with the state government's policy to ease coronavirus-related curbs. Earlier, the state government had allowed reopening of religious places and schools for standards VII to XII. Nashik city has five multiplexes with a total 15 screens. Of these, one multiplex with five screens reopened on Friday, while two more facilities with five screens are expected to reopen in the next few days. “We started our multiplexes with five screens in accordance with government guidelines. We received very good response though we started with 50% capacity on the very first day of the show,” said an official from the multiplex, which has 10 screens at three locations. Nashik city resident Vijay Kurule said, “The last one-and-a-half years of Covid pandemic made us tired and we were waiting for the multiplexes to reopen. I enjoyed the first show of a movie at the multiplex.” Richa Kakkar, a movie buff, said, “Watching movies at multiplex is really exciting. We can’t get the same feeling while watching a movie online.” Apart from multiplexes, the auditoriums also opened today. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has three auditoriums, including one that is being renovated. “Kalidas Kala Mandir and Dadasaheb Gaikwad hall reopened from Friday. We have Saturday’s booking for Gaikwad and a programme at Kalidas on Monday,” an NMC official said. Single screen theatres have decided not to start operations and wait for a few weeks. Vinay Chumbhle, president of the Single Screen Theatre Owners’ Association, said, “Ww have decided to wait and watch as we are pursuing our demands with the state and central governments. One of the major demands is about allowing exit policy to single screen theatre owners so that they can decide whether to continue with the theatre or build a mall or shopping complex on the same premises. In Kolhaur, the Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruh resumed in Kolhapur after a gap of 11 months. The theatre artists had organized a special event called ‘Anandotsav’, on Friday evening to celebrate reopening of the auditoriums. The event, which included song and dance shows, was attended by Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil. While inaugurating the programme, Patil assured the artistes from the city that the rent of the Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruh would be further reduced by 50% to help the theatre fraternity tide over the pandemic-induced losses. Earlier, the administration had announced a 10% reduction in the rent amount. Mahesh Jadhav, a theatre and film make-up artist, said, “It was the need of the hour to open the theatres.” Single screen theatres were likely to open from next week. Suryakant Patil-Budhihalkar from cine-exhibitors association said, “As most of the theatre owners were not having any product with them, the single screen theatres did not reopen on Friday. The facilities will reopen next week.” Only the screens at Inox at Reliance Mall and PVR at DYP City Mall have started with a few shows and are allowing people who have received both the vaccines. Cinema halls and auditoriums also reopened in Aurangabad on Friday. Dashrath Khajindar, general manager of an organization heading three multiplexes in the city, told TOI, “The response was good on Day One and we had 40 shows at our three multiplexes. We are confident that the number of customers will increase and people will return to the halls to watch cinema. A manager with a leading multiplex said, “There were so many people happy to visit cinema halls after a long gap. We are confident about packed shows on weekends.” In some cases, the cinema halls had to call off some shows for want of an adequate audience. Of the 10 shows lined up for Day One at Amba and Apsara cinema halls, four had to be cancelled due to lack of response. Its manager, Alen Lazarus, said, “We are confident that the crowd will definitely return to the halls.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/multiplexes-theatres-reopen-amid-covid-safety-measures/articleshow/87213549.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||Gadkari brings Sindi dry port works under his ministry’s control again||Nagpur: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has finally got his dream project back under his control. The dry port proposed by him at Sindi in Wardha district had been strongly pushed as a project that would give a major fillip to logistics business in Vidarbha. Gadkari lost control over the project when the shipping ministry was taken away from him, but now the project has been taken over by an undertaking of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which comes under Gadkari’s ministry. Coming up as a multimodal logistics park (MMLP), Sindi was a regular mention in Gadkari’s speeches. Being built by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), since Gadkari held the shipping ministry in his first term, the work had taken a back seat lately. On Friday, a MoU was signed between JNPT, and National Highways and Logistics Management Limited (NHLML), to develop the Sindi project. Formed around six months ago, NHLML is an NHAI undertaking. The minister also announced plans to set up more multimodal logistics parks on the lines of Sindi. JNPT is building similar facilities at Jalna, Solapur and Nashik, and a tie-up with NHLML is expected. In the second term of the BJP government, Gadkari was left with the road transport ministry. Work on Sindi port also took a back seat after that. This was because JNPT did not have much experience of building a hinterland port. Now with NHLML holding 60% stake in the JV with JNPT, much of the control is expected to be with Gadkari’s ministry. Gadkari said the project will develop Sindi town into a smart city and eventually develop Nagpur as the logistics capital of the country. Apart from an inland container depot (ICD), Sindi will also have a warehousing and industrial complex close by. This will bring units producing cargo close to the dry port, which will directly take the containers to JNPT port at Mumbai. The project will be developed on PPP basis with bids to be invited for roping in a private partner. At present, most of the work will be done by NHAI as JNPT, which has set up the basic infrastructure of an ICD and rail connectivity, does not have much role left in further development. NHAI will establish road connectivity to the park. A private developer will be roped in for running the park where units will be invited for taking up land in industrial and warehousing parks. “The MMLP will be different from a conventional ICD, which is already there in region, because of industries and warehousing facilities coming close to it,” said K Sathianathan, a director of NHLML. Apart from this, export cargo can also be moved for domestic destinations from Sindi, he said. Sathianathan said the Sindi project is close to Butibori and also has a number of other industries in its catchment area. At present there is movement of 10,000 twenty-feet equivalent units (TEU) containers from Nagpur. There are three ICDs operational with two more, including Sindi, coming up. The strategic location of Sindi is expected to attract much of the exiting business to the logistics park. Sanjay Sethi, chairman of JNPT, said formalities which are normally done only at the port will be completed right at the ICD in Sindi. Similar facilities are not available in conventional ICDs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/gadkari-brings-sindi-dry-port-works-under-his-ministrys-control-again/articleshow/87213581.cms||Shishir Arya

Police have started an investigation, but no one has been arrested so far. In the first incident, city police station registered a case on the complaint of chief superintendent of government livestock farm (GLF) L C Ranga against YouTube channel City Big, channel scriber Sakshi Soni, GLF former employees Ramkumar alias Alisher, Balbir Singh and Ishwar under Section 3R (intentionally insult or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste) of the SC/ST Act. In the complaint to the police, Ranga said former GLF employees Ramkumar and Balbir wanted him to do illegitimate work and for this they met him in July. When he refused to do their work, they got uploaded a ‘baselase’ news on the topic of “big scam in the animal husbandry department of Hisar” on the social media and made many serious and false allegations of corruption against him with the help of a YouTube channel scriber Sakshi Soni and others. City police station registered another case on the complaint of Dr Rajiv Dabla, a doctor of the general hospital of Hisar, against unknown scriber of BBN news channel under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Kochi||‘Refrain from unscientific construction in sensitive areas’||Kochi: The architects and technical experts should refrain from unscientific and dangerous construction works in places marked as vulnerable or sensitive, especially in the Western Ghats region, said L Gopakumar, chairman, Indian Institute of Architects (IIA), Kerala. He was commenting on the destruction caused to buildings and structures in the wake of the recent sudden and extremely heavy rainfall in the state. Gopakumar said that the IIA is ready to launch a strong campaign to build public opinion. “We will look at it as an opportunity to conduct environmental impact studies in collaboration with the state government and formulate a new design policy for Kerala.” He called on architects and the construction sector to ensure that there is no further natural disaster or loss of life triggered due to land misuse. Gopakumar said the IIA had decided to ensure the joint work of various environmental organizations for this purpose. Several government offices, resorts, religious buildings and places of worship are being built in the vulnerable areas. “The Madhav Gadgil report has been ignored by the Centre and the state government also. But people should show restraint,” Gopakumar said. Isolated buildings or small farms do not invite danger as much as large-scale mining and constructions which are responsible for these natural disasters like landslides. “One way of checking such damage could be if the technical experts in the construction sector unite and agree not to undertake such works. While the construction sector should not be discouraged, the focus should be on sustainable development. Mining should be balanced and large projects should be limited to safer areas,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/refrain-from-unscientific-construction-in-sensitive-areas/articleshow/87213583.cms||---

Acting on a complaint filed by Shahajuddin Hanifa (36), a mechanical engineer, the Nerul Police registered an FIR against Mahesh Shevati, director of RM Maritime Services. According to police, Hanifa had met Shevati at his Seawoods office in March 2019, seeking an overseas job. Shevati allegedly demanded Rs 3 lakh from Hanifa as commission, but offered a waiver, if he brought 50 candidates, who would be charged Rs 2 lakh each for a helper’s job in Abu Dhabi. Hanifa managed to persuade 29 jobseekers who collectively deposited Rs 52.20 lakh in his account. He transferred the money to Shevati’s account and paid Rs 2.70 lakh for his own job. On reaching Abu Dhabi, the jobseekers learnt that the said company did not exist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-30-kerala-men-seeking-jobs-abroad-duped-of-rs-55-lakh/articleshow/87214305.cms||George Mendonca
---||Lucknow||Ayushman Bharat triggers a steady rise in number of women availing cardiac care facility||LUCKNOW: In a glimmer of hope, the gender bias in diagnosis and treatment of women with cardiovascular ailments seems to be shrinking. A glimpse of this has documented by the authorities at UP State Agency for Comprehensive Health Insurance and Integrated Services that works to implement the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. Contrary to available evidence that only one in three persons who seek treatment for cardiac care in the world is a woman, a surge in the number of women availing cardiac care packages has been recorded in Uttar Pradesh. As per data from UP SACHIS, 43% of the total beneficiaries who underwent procedures to mitigate their cardiac ailments coronary artery diseases (one or more blockage in the arteries). More than 2500 angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) procedures have been undertaken under the Ayushman Bharat scheme since its launch in 2018. Officials said that had it not been for covid-19 pandemic, the number of beneficiaries would have been higher than this. But they endorsed the trend. “It is beyond doubt that there is a gender bias in access to health care. There is no dearth of examples to prove that women – especially the elderly ones – were left to fate when diagnosed with cardiac problems. The same holds true for bone injuries,” said Sangeeta Singh, chief executive officer, SACHIS UP. She added that it was very encouraging to see women being brought to health care facilities for treatment of their complex problems. “The fact that 43% of the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat scheme were women is a hearty change. This is above the estimated global average of about 37% (male-female ratio being 1:2) women availing cardiac facilities,” she said. THE GENDER BIAS IS UNIVERSALWhile the subject is still limited to anecdotal evidences in India, global scientific evidence speaks for the gender bias in diagnosis and treatment of cardiac care facilities. An article in the British Medical Journal concluded that there was extensive gender discrimination in healthcare access for women in India. It also noted that younger and older women and those living furthest away from the major hospitals were most likely to miss out on health care. More particularly, the British Heart Foundation has noted that women were 50% more likely than men to be misdiagnosed. Another study found that the mortality rate for women in the year immediately after suffering a heart attack was 38%, compared to 25% for men. This is most likely a result of the fact that women tend to delay seeking medical help for their symptoms for longer. A University of Leeds study (funded by the British Heart Foundation) that analysed the UK’s National Heart Attack Registry concluded that at least 8000 deaths in female heart attack patients may have been prevented had they received the same standard of care as men. Also, women were 2.7% less likely to receive treatments such as stents and reperfusion (treatment that restores blood flow to the heart) in a timely manner and were 7.4% less likely to be prescribed beta-blockers (drugs that reduce your chances of experiencing a subsequent heart attack). Experts have noted that the longer a heart attack is left untreated, the longer cardiac muscle is deprived of oxygen and the more damage is incurred. Prompt treatment is therefore crucial in preventing deaths. President, Cardiological Society of India, Prof Satyendra Tewari endorses the pattern. “Fewer women than men with cardiac ailments landing for treatment is not new to us. Delay is another issue. Indications of the paradigm shift from the Ayushman Bharat are encouraging,” he said. POLICY CAN FIGHT THE SOCIAL EVILData also indicates that the bias is across all ages. A study undertaken by researchers led by Shibba Thakkar Chhabra ay Ludhiana’s Dayanand Medical College and Hospital to analyse the gender bias in paediatric patients referred for free cardiac treatment as part of School Health Programme noted that of the 519 children studied, only 195 (37.6%) were girls despite the provision of free cardiac treatment. An equal prevalence of gender bias in urban and rural communities’ points towards deep-rooted social norms beyond just the economic constraints. A previous study led by Dr S Ramakrishnan of All India Institute of Medical Sciences revealed that of the 405 patients of congenital heart diseases studied, 44% of girls (59 out of 134 girls) had undergone surgery in the first 1 year compared with 70% boys (189 out of 271). Predictors for non-compliance with surgery included female gender among other things including financial aspects. Experts are of the view that healthcare policies ensuring equal treatment of male and female should be promulgated to ensure a complete eradication of this social evil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/more-women-availing-cardiac-care-facility-now/articleshow/87214881.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Goa||Noise pollution offenders can lose shack licence: Collector||PANAJI: The government is seeking directions from the high court of Bombay at Goa to curb the nuisance of sound pollution in coastal areas. The government has stated that the high court can issue directions to the tourism department and the village panchayat to cancel the permission of shacks in cases where shack owners are found to be in repeated violations of noise pollution. As all provisions are not covered under the noise pollution rules 2000, the government has stated that directions can be issued that habitual violators not be granted any permission for playing music/using amplified sound systems and/or using loudspeakers for two years. In order to curb the noise pollution, directions can be issued that the police inspector in charge of every police station to submit a monthly report to the superintendent of police of all the complaints received complaining about the sound violators along with the names and addresses of the violators in order to keep a check on repeated offenders, North Goa collector Ajit Roy stated. In a meeting on March 31, 2021, the collector directed all the deputy collectors to maintain data of the number of complaints against violators and action to be taken against repeated violators by issuing show cause notice or cancelling the trade licence. “I state that the action of cancellation of trade licence and excise licence can be initiated against the repeated violators,” Roy submitted to the highcourt. He added that decibel meters are a bit expensive and it may not be possible to provide a decibel meter to each and every member of the monitoring committee. “The decibel meters are provided to the police station concerned. As such upon a complaint, the police officials can look into the complaint and record the sound using their decibel meters,” he said. A periodic monthly report from the noise monitoring committee can be forwarded to the deputy collector of the area for taking action, he added. Advocate Nigel Da Costa Frias representing the petitioner Sagardeep Sirsaikar in the public interest litigation told the high court on Thursday that noise pollution is a chronic problem continuing along the coastal belt for many years with parties continuing until early morning causing a nuisance to villagers. While tourism has to continue, the noise cannot be a nuisance to citizens, he stated. The petitioner submited that the noise pollution has been disturbing the peace and tranquility of Chapora, Anjuna and Vagator affecting senior citizens, families and minor school going children and recently submitted videos to the high court regarding this.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/noise-pollution-offenders-can-lose-shack-licence-collector/articleshow/87214298.cms||---

On October 16, the remaining 32 were asked to go and they included arts and engineering graduates.Corporation sources told TOI that all departments were being revamped and workers’ strength was being taken stock of as the government was trying to overcome its financial crisis. Contract workers would be the first to go in such situations, they said.  Arun, (name changed) one among the affected, says his marriage was fixed based on his job, but now he doesn’t know what to do. “Others have elderly parents and families to take care of, terminating them during the festival season is unfair” says Balasubramanian.They were getting paid Rs 525 a day from the contractor of street lights. However, the corporation being the primary employer should have been sensitive to the needs of these people, he added. ``We worked relentlessly even during the Covid outbreak at quarantine centres, where regular workers refused to go. Now we are being deprived of our jobs,’’ another affected man said.Balasubramaniam says corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan told him that this was done on a direction from the government to downsize staff in departments where they were not needed. ``He said that they were going to use regular employees of the corporation for the job, but after nearly 10 years, corporation staff are definitely not going to be equipped for this very important job,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/financial-crisis-madurai-corpn-fires-32-contract-staff/articleshow/87214281.cms||---

Fortunately, the number of ECMO referral for Covid patients has come down drastically in the past few months as we have a lighter case load. But due to awareness among the medical community about ECMO for very critical heart and lung cases, we have started getting more non-Covid patients too,” said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar, Medica Hospital vice-chairman who also heads the ECMO. According to his family, Mohammad Saadique Akhtar was first admitted to Ryod Nursing Home on May 1 where he was detected with Covid infection. The 44-year-old was later shifted to Apollo Hospitals. Though he improved initially, he got a Cytomegalovirus infection as a post-Covid complication. Akhtar was shifted to Medica on June 18 since he needed ECMO support. “The patient was on ECMO support for 90 days, which included 80 days of Veno-Venous ECMO for respiratory support and 10 days of ECMO support for both heart and lungs,” said ECMO specialist Arpan Chakraborty. The patient suffered two episodes of cardiac arrest during treatment and had myocarditis, which needed both lung and heart support. “We cannot thank the Medica team enough, especially doctors Arpan Chakraborty and Dipanjan Chatterjee, for the kind of care given to my husband,” said Akhtar’s wife Farnaz Nazli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/44-year-old-goes-home-after-90-days-on-ecmo-support/articleshow/87213535.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Patil was in Dindori to inaugurate sugar cane crushing of the Kadwa Co-operative Sugar Mill on Friday. There has been an excessive production of sugar and sugar mills also need to produce byproducts to make the factors viable. “The central government has already announced incentives for producing ethanol from the sugar cane. The state has also set the target of producing 10 lakh metric tonne of ethanol this year.

Vinay Chumbhle, president of the Single Screen Theatre Owners’ Association, said, “Ww have decided to wait and watch as we are pursuing our demands with the state and central governments.

---||Madurai||Reclassify Vandiyur as drinking water tank, stop water overflow: Residents||MADURAI: Water has been overflowing from the Vandiyur tank for the past two months thanks to the intermittent heavy rainfall, but residents say most of it could be conserved if the tank is reclassified for drinking water purpose from the present irrigation. Spread over an area of about 575 acre, this is the biggest tank on the northern side of the city and under the control of PWD. It was used to irrigate about 360 acres of land till 2002, that has shrunk to less than 100 acres. The tank is the main storage point of a cascading system, but it has not been desilted for over five decades. Consequently, its water holding capacity has been reduced drastically over the years. Residential areas of K K Nagar, Melamadai, Gomathypuram, Pandikoil, Karupayoorani, Yagappa Nagar, Matuthavani, lakeview and Vandiyur depend on the tank for their ground water recharge. When the tank runs dry, so do more than 80% of borewells in these areas. S Asokan of Tahsildar Nagar had been purchasing water for Rs 500 a week till 2019 and it was only after the tank became full that his borewell got recharged. The government can even ask residents for small contributions to desilt the tank, as it goes a long way in helping them meet their daily water needs, says he. President of Gomathypuram- Thendral Nagar Residents Welfare Association D Raghavan says their demand for reclassification of the tank from irrigation to drinking water has been long-pending. This was one poll promise they had obtained from candidates who contested in Madurai North in the recent elections. “There have been many plans to desilt and beautify the tank and make it a tourist attraction, but nothing had materialised for over two decades. The tank has not even been cleared of its silt,’’ he said. “Had the tank been desilted, much more water than what is now overflowing would be required to fill it,” said K Rajendran, a resident of K K Nagar. Residents have also written to the CM's cell demanding that the sewage discharge into the channel near the flower market from the industrial and residential areas be prevented, and that the corporation set up an STP to at least treat the sewage. Raghavan said the PWD has stated that it would not be able to reclassify it as long as the 90 acres owned by one person is under irrigation. The water for the irrigation of these paddy fields flows through the 30th sluice of the tank on Periyar 9th main channel. The government is taking steps to maintain and restore urban water bodies for drinking water purposes, hence this tank too should be given the same importance as a drinking water source, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/reclassify-vandiyur-as-drinking-water-tank-stop-water-overflow-residents/articleshow/87214301.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

The man with the licensed firearm, Jitendra Pandey, was nabbed at least 45 minutes before Yogi’s arrival, but heads rolled in the police force as the intruder passed through multiple frisking layers leading to the venue. Pandey, who claimed to be a relative of a block pramukh in Basti, was caught with the gun in the final drill before the VIP event kicked off at Atal Bihar Vajpayee auditorium. The probe panel constituted immediately after the security breach indicted the seven cops for dereliction of duty. Talking to TOI, superintendent of police, Basti, Ashish Srivastava, said, “The Itwa circle officer on duty, Ramesh Pandey, spotted the gun-wielding man inside the auditorium during the security protocol drill.” Senior cops were alerted and the man was quickly whisked away. But seven cops deployed to frisk invitees at the auditorium entrance were suspended and departmental action has been recommended against them.” Of the seven, two constables sourced from neighbouring Siddharthnagar district and another from Sant Kabir Nagar, too were suspended. Those suspended from Basti included sub-inspectors Vindhyachal Kumar, Harirai, head constables Shivdhani and Ramprakash.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/gun-wielding-man-sneaks-into-cms-basti-venue-7-cops-suspended/articleshow/87214896.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The district superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade has passed an order imposing several traffic restrictions such as no-entry, one-ways, ban on entry of heavy vehicles and traffic diversions at Gandhi Nagar market. The heavy traffic at Gandhi Nagar causes congestion on the Tawade hotel road, which is the city’s main entry point. The Pune-Bengaluru national highway 48 between Gandhi Nagar and Kolhapur gets clogged due to the traffic and affects the movement of traffic along the national highway. “Gandhi Nagar is the biggest shopping market in south Maharashtra. Around 25,000 customers visit the market daily. There is a huge rush in the market, especially during Diwali. Hence, the main road will remain closed for heavy vehicles from 10.00am to 11.00pm till Diwali ends. These vehicles will be diverted from outside,” Balkawade said. Two-wheelers and four-wheelers will be banned from entering Ganesh Talkies to the Valivade stretch of the road. It will be reserved only for pedestrians. The small roads inside the market will remain banned for all sorts of vehicles. Only emergency vehicles will be allowed inside the core shopping areas. Balkawade visited the area on Thursday and decided to implement the traffic regulations from Friday onwards. On the first day, the core shopping areas were significantly de-congested. The authorities have claimed that it will take at least a couple of days for the smooth implementation of the traffic regulations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/gandhi-nagar-market-road-closed-for-heavy-vehicles/articleshow/87211986.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Trials for first antiviral Covid pill begin in Nagpur||Nagpur: After hosting trials of various types of Covid-19 vaccines and some drugs delivered through injections, Nagpur has become the site for the human trials of an oral pill that promises to cure patients with mild Covid without hospitalization. The infectious disease department of Kingsway Hospital is hosting the trial of molnupiravir, which could become the first oral antiviral Covid treatment. According to Merck which has developed this pill, it forces the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to mutate itself to death. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade is the principal investigator for the trials which have started at Kingsway Hospital. Registration of volunteers is still going as the number of Covid patients with mild symptoms in Nagpur has gone down significantly. Dr Tayade said that if authorized, molnupiravir can be a milestone in Covid-19 treatment. “We are hosting a double-blind trial of molnupiravir and still registering patients. It has proven to be a really good antiviral treatment so far. We are trying it on unvaccinated patients on priority,” said Dr Tayade. At least two Indian drug makers have been independently testing generic molnupiravir in people with moderate Covid-19since July. They saw no “significant efficacy” in moderate patients. But since the drug has shown positive results for mild illness, trials are underway on mild patients. According to Dr Tayade, the pills may prove beneficial even for people who get infected even after vaccination. “There is growing concern about the duration for which the vaccines will work and their efficacy against new variants. Many rich countries have started booster doses. In the interim results for the trails, this pill showed 50% reduction in hospitalization risk. Soon, we may treat Covid-19 at home with this pill,” said Dr Tayade. Molnupiravir is an affordable generic oral drug and it may reduce the treatment cost of Covid-19 significantly. It can be a game-changer for low-income group countries. As far as vaccines are concerned, they have been effective against moderate to severe illness. But cases are still coming, though in small numbers, in Vidarbha, implying that vaccines haven’t been able to prevent virus transmission. Most of the patients being detected now are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. They may benefit to a great extent if the oral pill is approved post-trial.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/trials-for-first-antiviral-covid-pill-begin-in-nagpur/articleshow/87213595.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Following a marathon meeting on Friday, CISCE announced the revised timetables. The CISCE chief executive and secretary, Gerry Arathoon, in the circular said that concerns expressed by schools, parents and students pertaining to network and bandwidth issues, non-availability of devices and irregular power supply led to the change in exam mode.  All non-state boards have already begun conducting exams offline in October-November. Both Cambridge and International Baccalaureate (IB) are currently holding exams offline – till mid-November. These boards, however, have fewer students.  “With CBSE students taking the physical boards, CISCE’s online exams would not have much weightage,” said an educator. Both CBSE and CISCE are in favour of holding physical exams in March-April.  With the threat of a Covid-19 third wave waning, schools felt it is the best time to take physical exams. Principals said that students have got adequate practice of sample papers and will be able to switch from online to offline with ease.  Cambridge board has begun its physical exams (November series) offline saying that it is the fairest and most accurate way of assessing candidates’ performance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-icse-isc-exams-to-be-held-offline-from-november-22/articleshow/87214326.cms||Sandhya Nair

Recognising this, the Atal Incubation Centre at the Goa Institute of Management (AICGIM), Sakhali, set up under Niti Aayog, is set to gather data, assess it and offer solutions to build Panaji’s resilience to climate change.  The centre has put together a Climate Collective made up of members from across the country, which includes researchers, students, data analysts, professionals and entrepreneurs who will work in teams starting from Saturday, for seven days. The organisers have dubbed the event Climathon Panaji 2021. “‘Ahead of the ‘Smart-City’ proposition for Panaji, such an initiative strikes a balance between policy, environment, and organisational projections,” said Pratap Raju, founder of the Climate Collective. It will be a virtual event and will be solution-oriented, where the collective will be working on the problem at hand till the end of the month, said Raju. The idea is to finding solutions related to data analytics for climate change. “The event is part of ESG Start-up Week organised by AICGIM which looks to bring about conversations on environment, social, and governance-based issues. Indian citizens with knowledge in the field of data analytics with regards to climate solutions will participate as a team or individually,” said Rajesh Joshi, CEO, AICGIM. A team will consist of three to five members. “It is critical to use innovation and technology to better recognise and analyse climate risk. It will help us adjust and adapt in our changing environment. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced data analytics can efficiently address climate risk. Startups will be crucial in the development of these new technologies and solutions,” said Raju.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/data-analysts-to-help-panaji-tackle-climate-change/articleshow/87214316.cms||---

---||Agra||Allahabad HC raps SIT over probe in rape-murder case of schoolgirl||Agra: The Allahabad high court (HC) has expressed displeasure with the speed of investigation in the case of the death of a 16-year-old student in Uttar Pradesh's Mainpuri back in 2019. The girl was allegedly raped and found hanging inside a prominent governmentresidential school building. The court aired its dissatisfaction after the state government submitted the status report of the case earlier this week which suggested that DNA samples of 170 suspects have been taken and sent to a laboratory for testing. The results are yet to be received. The court ordered the director general of police (DGP) to appear in person in case the DNA test reports are not in by October 25, which is the next date of hearing. On September 17, the government had announced a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to take over the case after the court pulled up the UP police for being careless with the probe. The DGP had admitted to serious lapses in investigation. He had informed the court that semen was detected on the victim’s underwear during lab tests, but the investigation officer did not send it for DNA testing within 45 days, as mandated. This would have helped match the sample with that of the accused named in the FIR as well as of other suspects. Earlier, TOI had reported that the new SIT investigating the case had collected blood samples of the suspects, including that of the son of a UP cabinet minister. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was also announced for those who came up with leads in the case by ADG of Kanpur zone, Bhanu Bhaskar, who is heading the new SIT. The case was initially believed to that of suicide. However, an FIR was subsequently registered against the school principal, hostel warden, and a boy from the arts stream with charges of murder and attempt to rape, based on a complaint filed by the girl’s father. Rape charges were added after the post-mortem report found clotted blood in the vagina and a torn hymen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/allahabad-hc-raps-sit-over-probe-in-rape-murder-case-of-schoolgirl/articleshow/87211985.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Insurance fraud leads to fake call centre racket||MUMBAI: City police who recently nabbed a fake insurance executive for allegedly cheating a nationalised bank employee of Rs 90,000 with policy refund promises, have stumbled upon a fake call centre racket and arrested three more persons in the case. The acused had employed seven to eight women to run the call centre. Police had arrested the main accused, Suraj Waghmare (28), earlier this week and on Friday they held Sagar Pavle (36), Tejas Panwalkar (26) and Namdev Jungle (33). All four were produced before a court and remanded to police custody till October 23. The fresh development comes after investigators recovered a two-wheeler parking pass on Waghmare’s person after his arrest. It belonged to a parking slot of a mall in Kapurbawdi, Thane. The pass also mentioned a shop number on it. Cops reached the address and found the call centre. On October 10, a 58-year-old bank employee approached DB Marg police and said she had received a call from an insurance executive who asked her if she wanted to surrender three of her policies and promised her a refund of Rs 2.9 lakh in all. She transferred Rs 90,000 as “processing fees” into the account till she realised she had been defrauded. It was Waghmare who had made the call. During interrogation, police found his WhatsApp chats with over a hundred people and suspected he may have similarly contacted them by offering policy refund. A police team led by senior inspector Pradip Khude, PI Raja Bidkar, API Rajaram Pol and PSI Pradip Patil are probing the case. “The accused had rented a gala to run the fake call centre. They had also hired seven to eight girls. The girls, who were paid salaries up to Rs 10,000 a month, thought they were working for a genuine call centre. They will be our witnesses,” said a cop.  Initially the women would call up policy holders and later the accused would try to convince them, said police. Cops have found 10 bank accounts used to transfer funds. The account holders would be paid 35% commission from the proceeds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-insurance-fraud-leads-to-fake-call-centre-racket/articleshow/87214333.cms||Mateen Hafeez

As per the prosecution, Mohd Salman, Mohd Saleem, Arif Gulam Bashir Dharampuria and Mohd Hussain Molani were arrested for allegedly receiving money from Pakistani outfit, Falah-I-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), to create unrest in India by sending funds for terrorist activities. The agency had said that on March 14, 2012, FIF was declared a terrorist organisation by the United Nations. Special Judge Parveen Singh said the prosecution failed to bring forth any evidence that would raise a grave suspicion that either the funds that were being sent from Dubai were terror funds/funds originated from the terrorist organisation or that these were intended to be used for terror activities. “I find that although the activities of Salman were suspicious in nature and he along with other co-accused was engaged in illegal activities of Hawala transactions, the prosecution has failed to bring forth any evidence that would raise a grave suspicion that either the funds that were being sent from Dubai and were being received by him through other accused were terror funds/funds originated from the terrorist organisation or that these funds were intended to be used for terror activities i.e. creation of sleeper cells/ sympathisers hideouts/ logistic support for the terrorists of LeT/ JuD and FIF,” the judge said in the order. The court said that the mere fact the accounts were being maintained or receipts/reports were being sent to accused Kamran by Salman cannot be of much consequence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/four-booked-under-uapa-in-terror-funding-case-freed/articleshow/87214334.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||NGT notice to HSPCB over environmental compensation waiver||CHANDIGARH: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has taken a serious note of “waiver of environmental compensation” worth several crores of rupees to defaulting units of Barhi industrial area of Sonipat. The National Green Tribunal on Thursday initiated execution proceedings on an application moved by the complainant in the case. Besides putting Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on notice, the NGT bench has further directed the pollution watchdog to put the defaulting units on notice and file a detailed reply within a month. The NGT bench, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goyal, fixed January 19, 2022 as the next date of hearing. Last year, Varun, a resident of Sonipat, had moved a complaint against Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other agencies, alleging damage to water and earth on the account of release of pollutants directly into Yamuna as well as drains without any treatment. During the course of proceedings, it had come to light that the state pollution watchdog and the local committees had slapped a fine varying between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 17 crore to the units and had filed a detail report. According to rule, the board was the nodal agency for recovery of environmental compensation from polluting units and the amount recovered was to be spent in the measures to be taken for restoration of damage done to the environment. Getting to know about the waiver, Varun moved the NGT for recovery proceedings. “Grievance in this application is that despite order of this tribunal dated 05.03.2021 in OA No. 32/2021, Varun v. CPCB & Ors., finding that the industrial units in question functioning at Barhi Industrial area in Sonipat district, Haryana were violating the environmental norms and remedial action was required, no remedial action has been taken and violations have continued. The compensation assessed instead of being recovered and spent for restoration has been waived arbitrarily for extraneous reasons,” the order read. Though senior bureaucrats involved could not be conducted, a couple of senior board officials admitted knowledge of the development. “Certainly, we shall obey the orders of the NGT,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ngt-notice-to-hspcb-over-environmental-compensation-waiver/articleshow/87214330.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Nagpur||Central govt to amend Wildlife Protection Act||Nagpur: The Central government will amend the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, by making some changes and seeking suggestions from states. The amended Act will give powers to the Centre to declare areas which it deemed fit to declare them as conservation reserves. These powers were wrested with the states till now. It will also allow the states to constitute the standing committee of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) on the lines of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), which is the topmost body deciding project proposals affecting tiger reserves and sanctuaries. The SBWL standing committee too will have similar powers. It will consist of the vice-chairperson, member-secretary and not more than 10 members to be nominated by the vice-chairperson from amongst the members of the SBWL. At present, the SBWL is headed by chief ministers and there are more members from various departments and experts from all fields. “The new amendment will delay decisions and meetings will not be held regularly like the NBWL which is chaired by the Prime Minister. NBWL has not met for the last 7 years,” said wildlife experts. The amendments give SBWL or its standing committee powers to constitute committees, sub-committees or study groups as may be necessary from time to time in the proper discharge of the functions assigned to it. Further, the words ‘Land Acquisition Act, 1894’ shall be substituted with the words ‘Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.’ The new bill allows the state government to establish such committees for conservation of wildlife and biodiversity as deemed appropriate to ensure people’s participation and eco-development and notify any rules necessary for this purpose. It also allows the establishment of foundations to ensure management and conservation of wildlife and biodiversity and notify any rules necessary for this purpose. A new section is being added regarding the surrender of wild animals and products. Now, any person having a certificate of ownership, who is not desirous to further keep in his control, custody, or possession any wild or captive animal specified in Schedule 1 or II, or any animal article, trophy or uncured trophy or meat derived from such animal referred to the above or ivory imported into India or an article made from such ivory shall, after due notice of seven working days to the chief wildlife warden, surrender the same to him. The certificate of ownership for such articles shall stand automatically cancelled from the date of such surrender. Any person, who comes to be in possession of a wild animal, captive animal, animal article, or trophy without committing any contravention of the provisions of this Act shall within 48 hours surrender the same to the CWLW. Moreover, a new chapter is being added to the Act on the regulation of international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora as per the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna and flora. The Central government shall appoint management authorities and scientific authorities with the requisite powers to carry out their functions under the CITES Convention.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/central-govt-to-amend-wildlife-protection-act/articleshow/87213608.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||SP is ready for revolution; our blood will usher a new horizon in Uttar Pradesh: Jai Shankar Pandey||Veteran Socialist leader Jai Shankar Pandey, 70, who was recently appointed state vice-president of Samajwadi Party, has a political career spanning five decades. One of the founding members of SP, a two-time MLA and a close aide of party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, age is no bar for Pandey, who is rearing to hit the streets to campaign for the party. Q. What is the possibility of Samajwadi Party storming to power in 2022? BJP has a vibrant Ram Mandir plank, Hindutva and development agenda. How would SP mobilise the electorate?A. Keep aside politics of religion, talk about the global poverty index. India has slipped to 101st position in Global Hunger Index of 116 countries and is behind its neighbours, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. The October 14, 2021, report puts India’s score in the ‘serious category’. Q. Only four months are left for the crucial assembly elections, but Samajwadi Party is yet to embark on mammoth statewide protests against the BJP government, like it did during 2012 polls.A. We are ready to unleash massive protests against failures of BJP government on law and order, economy, unemployment, poverty and condition of farmers. Just wait and see. Q. Can you spell out your strategy and timing?A. We will trigger a revolution in cities and villages of Uttar Pradesh. Our cadre will be hammered by police and BJP goons, but our blood will usher a new horizon in Uttar Pradesh. Yehi khoon hamara rang layega. Our government will ensure democracy and freedom of speech, which is missing now. Q. BJP claims to have developed the state, removed poverty, ensured jobs and distributed free ration to 15lakh poor. What do you have to say on this?A. There is a proverb ‘Greater the lie, it’s oft repeated to make people believe’. Uttar Pradesh has a population of approximately 22crore and among them 15crore are still poor. This is the real index of BJP's development. They are distributing free ration, because people are poor. But you haven't made them able to buy ration from their own money. Samajwadi Party manifesto will promise uplifting 15 crore poor people and making them self-reliant. Q. You have worked with great socialist leaders like Lohia, Madhu Limaye, Raj Narain, Jai Prakash Narayan and Chandra Shekar. How do you compare Akhilesh Yadav with these leaders?A. Un mahaan Samajwadi netaon ki khwaabon ki tabeer hain Akhilesh Yadav (Akhilesh Yadav is the living reality of the dreams of great socialist leaders). He’s the only one who can provide a democratic and secular government in Uttar Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sp-is-ready-for-revolution-our-blood-will-usher-a-new-horizon-in-uttar-pradesh-jai-shankar-pandey/articleshow/87214902.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Kolhapur||580 villages from Kolhapur pledge not to burst crackers this Diwali||KOLHAPUR: Nearly half of this western Maharashtra district will have eco-friendly celebrations this Diwali largely due to the decision of 580 village panchayats not to burst firecrackers. Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Sanjaysinha Chavan had appealed to the village panchayats to pass resolutions against allowing villagers to use noisy and smoke generating firecrackers. This move, however, did not include any kind of incentive or awards to the village panchayats. Upon Chavan’s appeal, 580 village panchayats passed the resolution and more villages are likely to join the movement to make skies free of pollution. “Several village panchayats are already celebrating firecrackers-free Diwali. We had appealed to other village panchayats to follow it and over 580 have passed the resolution in their monthly meetings. The district has around 1,025 village panchayats. Many more grampanchayat’s are likely to be added in the movement to celebrate Diwali cracker-free,” he told TOI. Chavan said that since the decision has been taken voluntarily by the members of village panchayats, they will themselves implement and monitor it. Also, the village panchayats can organise several events showcasing the side effects of the use of firecrackers on human health as well as environment. “We have extended all sorts support to the village panchayats. Many are already aware of the damage caused by the firecrackers. The villagers can make a difference this Diwali,” said Chavan. Village panchayat members have to convince traders not to sell firecrackers in their jurisdiction, but they cannot ban them from selling. Similarly, the members have to convince the villagers not to burn firecrackers, but they cannot force them to do so by banning sale and buying firecrackers. Every year, the Diwali firecrackers in many parts of the state and country breach the permissible noise level limits. Air pollution levels on Diwali days is also higher than the safe norm at times.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/580-villages-from-kolhapur-pledge-not-to-burst-crackers/articleshow/87212028.cms||---
---||Lucknow||A blast the deaf British ear heard||At about 12.30pm on April 8, 1929, as the President of the Central Assembly at Delhi (akin to today’s Lok Sabha Speaker) Vithalbhai Patel began to give his ruling on the Trade Disputes Bill, an explosion occurred, and the hall began to be filled with smoke. The bomb was thrown by Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt. The two young revolutionaries raised slogans from the visitors’ gallery: ‘Inquilab Zindabad’, ‘workers of the world unite’, and ‘down with imperialism’. They also threw pamphlets into the hall. The bombs hurled in the Central Assembly were not just to make the ‘deaf hear’ but also to oppose the repressive bills aimed at curtailing freedom of press, curbing civil liberties and restricting rights of workers. Singh and Dutt did not flee the scene or try to evade arrest after the act. They willingly courted arrest. Members of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, their motive, as stated by them, was not to kill or injure people, but to ‘make the deaf hear’. ARCHITECTS OF CENTRAL ASSEMBLY BOMBING BHAGAT SINGH: He was the mastermind behind the bombing and was inspired by French anarchist Auguste Vaillant who had bombed the French Chamber of Deputies in 1893. Vaillant was executed for the act. Singh after the bombing had stated, "Bombs and pistols do not make revolution. The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting-stone of ideas. By revolution, we mean the end of the miseries of capitalist wars." He also said, "Revolution is made by labouring intellectuals and hardworking activists. Unfortunately, the intellectual side of the Indian Revolution has always remained weak. As a result, the essential elements of the revolution as well as the effects of work accomplished have not been sufficiently addressed. Therefore, it is necessary for a revolutionary to consider studying and reflection a sacred duty." BATUKESHWAR DUTT: Initially it was decided that Dutt and Sukhdev would plant the bomb while Singh would travel to the USSR. However, later the plan was changed and Dutta was entrusted with planting it alongside Singh. After throwing the bomb, Dutt along with Singh shouted slogans and threw leaflets which stated that the act was done to oppose the trade disputes and public safety Bills being presented in the Central Assembly, as also against the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. IMPACT: POSITIVE | The two young revolutionaries turned the deaf, aristocratic British ears towards a youth upheaval that changed the course of India’s freedom movement NEGATIVE | The British government did not move an inch for the freedom of press, civil liberties or rights of workers Singh was hanged, while Dutt contracted tuberculosis before he was released from prison. He nonetheless participated in the Quit India Movement and was again jailed for four years. He was lodged in Motihari Jail (Bihar). After India gained Independence, his contribution to the freedom struggle was not recognized, and he spent his remaining life in poverty away from political limelight.

The complainant, Santosh Dubey, who claims to be an RSS supporter, alleged that Akhtar, with a view to gain political score, unnecessarily dragged the name of the RSS and defamed the organisation in a “calculated and well planned move.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyer-files-case-against-akhtar-for-remarks-on-rss/articleshow/87214343.cms||---

The court had on April 12 noted that an investigating officer (IO) was directed to supply a copy of e-challan to one of the accused in a riots case, but it was not supplied till September 25 because he was not aware of the order. On September 25, the court adjourned the matter for compliance of the April 12’s order and imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 to be deposited by Delhi Police. It then directed the police commissioner to conduct an inquiry for deduction of cost from the salary of the responsible officer within four weeks. On October 21, the court noted that no report in terms of its previous order has been received from the police commissioner although a request for extension of time for completion of inquiry as per directions of the police commissioner has been received from the DCP (northeast). “Let an explanation be called from commissioner of police, Delhi under his signatures through secretary (Home) Union of India as to why appropriate action as per law be not taken against him for non-submission of the report in terms of previous order,” chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said in the order. The IO had also filed an application for waiver of the cost imposed upon Delhi Police. The court waived off the cost, saying although no plausible explanation has been furnished by the IO for non-compliance with its directions, in the interest of justice, it was waived off as the copy of e-challan had been supplied to the accused. “However, it is made clear to DCP NE as well as to the commissioner of police, Delhi that in case in future the IOs seek adjournment for compliance with the orders on the ground that they were not aware of the directions, DCP NE as well as Delhi Police commissioner shall be held personally responsible for imposition of cost if any,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-warns-cops-in-ne-delhi-riots-cases/articleshow/87214346.cms||Usha Das
